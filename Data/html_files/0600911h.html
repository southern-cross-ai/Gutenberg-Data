<h2><a id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Nkima</span> danced
excitedly upon the naked, brown shoulder of his master. He
chattered and scolded, now looking up inquiringly into Tarzan's
face and then off into the jungle.</p>

<p>"Something is coming, Bwana," said Muviro, sub-chief
of the Waziri. "Nkima has heard it."</p>

<p>"And Tarzan," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"The big Bwana's ears are as keen as the ears of Bara the
antelope," said Muviro.</p>

<p>"Had they not been, Tarzan would not be here today,"
replied the ape-man, with a smile. "He would not have grown
to manhood had not Kala, his mother, taught him to use all of
the senses that Mulungu gave him."</p>

<p>"What comes?" asked Muviro.</p>

<p>"A party of men," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are not friendly," suggested the black. "Shall
I warn the warriors?"</p>

<p>Tarzan glanced about the little camp where a score of his
black fighting men were busy preparing their evening meal
and saw that, as was the custom of the Waziri, their weapons
were in order and at hand.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It will, I believe, be unnecessary, as these
people who are approaching do not come stealthily as enemies
would, nor are their numbers so great as to cause us any apprehension."</p>

<p>But Nkima, a born pessimist, expected only the worst, and
as the approaching party came nearer his excitement increased.
He leaped from Tarzan's shoulder to the ground, jumped up
and down several times and then springing back to Tarzan's
side, seized his arm and attempted to drag him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Run, run!" he cried, in the language of the apes. "Strange
Gomangani are coming. They will kill little Nkima."</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, Nkima," said the ape-man. "Tarzan
and Muviro will not let the strangers hurt you."</p>

<p>"I smell a strange Tarmangani," chattered Nkima. "There
is a Tarmangani with them. The Tarmangani are worse than
the Gomangani. They come with thundersticks and kill little
Nkima and all his brothers and sisters. They kill the Mangani.
They kill the Gomangani. They kill everything with their
thundersticks. Nkima not like the Tarmangani. Nkima is
afraid."</p>

<p>To Nkima, as to the other denizens of the jungle, Tarzan
was no Tarmangani, no white man. He was of the jungle. He
was one of them, and if they thought of him as being anything
other than just Tarzan it was as Mangani, a great ape, that
they classified him.</p>

<p>The advance of the strangers was now plainly audible to
everyone in the camp. The Waziri warriors glanced into the
jungle in the direction from which the sounds were coming
and then back to Tarzan and Muviro, but when they saw that
their leaders were not concerned they went quietly on with
their cooking.</p>

<p>A tall, black warrior was the first of the party to come
within sight of the camp. When he saw the Waziri he halted
and an instant later a bearded white man stopped beside him.</p>

<p>For an instant the white man surveyed the camp and then
he came forward, making the sign of peace. Out of the jungle
a dozen or more blacks followed him. Most of them were
porters, there being but three or four rifles in evidence.</p>

<p>Tarzan and the Waziri realized at once that it was a small
and harmless party, and even Nkima, who had retreated to
the safety of a nearby tree, showed his contempt by scampering
fearlessly back to climb to the shoulder of his master.</p>

<p>"Doctor von Harben!" exclaimed Tarzan, as the bearded
stranger approached. "I scarcely recognized you at first."</p>

<p>"God has been kind to me, Tarzan of the Apes," said
von Harben, extending his hand. "I was on my way to see
you and I have found you a full two days' march sooner
than I expected."</p>

<p>"We are after a cattle-killer," explained Tarzan. "He has
come into our kraal several nights of late and killed some of
our best cattle, but he is very cunning; I think he must be an
old lion to outwit Tarzan for so long.</p>

<p>"But what brings you into Tarzan's country, Doctor? I
hope it is only a neighbourly visit and that no trouble has
come to my good friend, though your appearance belies my
hope."</p>

<p>"I, too, wish that it were nothing more than a friendly call,"
said von Harben. "But as a matter of fact I am here to seek
your help because I am in trouble&mdash;very serious trouble, I
fear."</p>

<p>"Do not tell me that the Arabs have come down again to
take slaves or to steal ivory, or is it that the leopard men are
waylaying your people upon the jungle trails at night?"</p>

<p>"No, it is neither the one nor the other. I have come to see
you upon a more personal matter. It is about my son, Erich.
You have never met him."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan; "but you are tired and hungry. Let
your men make camp here. My evening meal is ready; while
you and I eat you shall tell me how Tarzan may serve you."</p>

<p>As the Waziri, at Tarzan's command, assisted von Harben's
blacks in making their camp, the doctor and the ape-man
sat cross-legged upon the ground and ate the rough fare that
Tarzan's Waziri cook had prepared.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw that his guest's mind was filled with the trouble
that had brought him in search of the ape-man, and so he did
not wait until they had finished the meal to reopen the subject,
but urged von Harben to continue his story at once.</p>

<p>"I wish to preface the real object of my visit with a few
words of explanation," commenced von Harben. "Erich is my
only son. Four years ago, at the age of nineteen, he completed
his university course with honours and received his
first degree. Since then he has spent the greater part of his
time in pursuing his studies in various European universities,
where he has specialized in archaeology and the study of dead
languages. His one hobby, outside of his chosen field, has
been mountain-climbing and during successive summer vacations
he scaled every important Alpine peak.</p>

<p>"A few months ago he came here to visit me at the mission
and immediately became interested in the study of the various
Bantu dialects that are in use by the several tribes in our
district and those adjacent thereto.</p>

<p>"While pursuing his investigation among the natives he ran
across that old legend of The Lost Tribe of the Wiramwazi
Mountains, with which we are all so familiar. Immediately his
mind became imbued, as have the minds of so many others,
with the belief that this fable might have originated in fact
and that if he could trace it down he might possibly find
descendants of one of the lost tribes of Biblical history."</p>

<p>"I know the legend well," said Tarzan, "and because it is
so persistent and the details of its narration by the natives
so circumstantial, I have thought that I should like to investigate
it myself, but in the past no necessity has arisen to take
me close to the Wiramwazi Mountains."</p>

<p>"I must confess," continued the doctor, "that I also have
had the same urge many times. I have upon two occasions
talked with men of the Bagego tribe that live upon the slopes
of the Wiramwazi Mountains and in both instances I have
been assured that a tribe of white men dwells somewhere in
the depths of that great mountain range. Both of these men
told me that their tribe has carried on trade with these people
from time immemorial and each assured me that he had often
seen members of The Lost Tribe both upon occasions of
peaceful trading and during the warlike raids that the
mountaineers occasionally launched upon the Bagego.</p>

<p>"The result was that when Erich suggested an expedition
to the Wiramwazi I rather encouraged him, since he was well
fitted to undertake the adventure. His knowledge of Bantu
and his intensive, even though brief, experiences among the
natives gave him an advantage that few scholars otherwise
equipped by education to profit by such an expedition would
have, while his considerable experience as a mountain-climber
would, I felt, stand him in good stead during such
an adventure.</p>

<p>"On the whole I felt that he was an ideal man to lead
such an expedition, and my only regret was that I could
not accompany him, but this was impossible at the time. I
assisted him in every way possible in the organization of his
safari and in equipping and provisioning it.</p>

<p>"He has not been gone a sufficient length of time to accomplish
any considerable investigation and return to the mission,
but recently a few of the members of his safari were reported
to me as having returned to their villages. When I sought to
interview them they avoided me, but rumours reached me
that convinced me that all was not well with my son. I therefore
determined to organize a relief expedition, but in all my
district I could find only these few men who dared accompany
me to the Wiramwazi Mountains, which, their legends assure
them, are inhabited by malign spirits&mdash;for, as you know, they
consider The Lost Tribe of the Wiramwazi to be a band of
bloodthirsty ghosts. It became evident to me that the deserters
of Erich's safari had spread terror through the district.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances I was compelled to look elsewhere
for help and naturally I turned, in my perplexity, to
Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now you know why I am
here."</p>

<p>"I will help you, Doctor," said Tarzan, after the other had
concluded.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed von Harben; "but I knew that you
would. You have about twenty men here, I should judge, and
I have about fourteen. My men can act as carriers, while
yours, who are acknowledged to be the finest fighting men in
Africa, can serve as askaris. With you to guide us we can
soon pick up the trail and with such a force, small though it
be, there is no country that we cannot penetrate."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "No, Doctor," he said, "I shall go
alone. That is always my way. Alone I may travel much
more rapidly and when I am alone the jungle holds no secrets
from me&mdash;I shall be able to obtain more information along
the way than would be possible were I accompanied by
others. You know the jungle people consider me as one of
themselves. They do not run away from me as they would
from you and these blacks."</p>

<p>"You know best," said von Harben. "I should like to
accompany you. I should like to feel that I am doing my
share, but if you say no I can only abide by your decision."</p>

<p>"Return to your mission, Doctor, and wait there until you
hear from me."</p>

<p>"And in the morning you leave for the Wiramwazi Mountains?"
asked von Harben.</p>

<p>"I leave at once," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"But it is already dark," objected von Harben.</p>

<p>"There is a full moon and I wish to take advantage of
it," explained the other. "I can lie up in the heat of the day
for what rest I need." He turned and called Muviro to him.
"Return home with my warriors, Muviro," he instructed, "and
hold every fighting man of the Waziri in readiness in the
event that I find it necessary to send for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," replied Muviro; "and how long shall we
wait for a message before we set out for the Wiramwazi
Mountains in search for you?"</p>

<p>"I shall take Nkima with me and if I need you I shall send
him back to fetch and to guide you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," replied Muviro. "They will be in readiness&mdash;all
the fighting men of the Waziri. Their weapons will be at
hand by day and by night and fresh war-paint will be ready in
every pot."</p>

<p>Tarzan swung his bow and his quiver of arrows across his
back. Over his left shoulder and under his right arm lay the
coils of his grass rope and at his hip dangled the hunting-knife
of his long-dead sire. He picked up his short spear and stood
for a moment with head up, sniffing the breeze. The firelight
played upon his bronzed skin.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood thus, every sense alert. Then he
called to Nkima in the tongue of the ape folk and as the little
monkey scampered toward him, Tarzan of the Apes turned
without a word of farewell and moved silently off into the
jungle, his lithe carriage, his noiseless tread, his majestic mien
suggesting to the mind of von Harben, a personification of
another mighty jungle animal, Numa the lion, king of beasts.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Erich von Harben</span> stepped from his tent upon the slopes of
the Wiramwazi Mountains to look upon a deserted camp.</p>

<p>When he had first awakened, the unusual quiet of his surroundings
had aroused within him a presentiment of ill,
which was augmented when repeated calls for his body-servant,
Gabula, elicited no response.</p>

<p>For weeks, as the safari had been approaching the precincts
of the feared Wiramwazi, his men had been deserting
by twos and threes until the preceding evening when they had
made this camp well upon the mountain slopes only a terrified
remnant of the original safari had remained with him.
Now even these, overcome during the night by the terrors of
ignorance and superstition, had permitted fear to supplant
loyalty and had fled from the impending and invisible terrors
of this frowning range, leaving their master alone with the
bloodthirsty spirits of the dead.</p>

<p>A hasty survey of the camp site revealed that the blacks
had stripped von Harben of everything. All of his supplies
were gone and his gun carriers had decamped with his rifles
and all of his ammunition, with the exception of a single
Luger pistol and its belt of ammunition that had been in the
tent with him.</p>

<p>Erich von Harben had had sufficient experience with these
natives to understand fairly well the mental processes based
upon their deep-rooted superstition that had led them to this
seemingly inhuman and disloyal act and so he did not place
so much blame upon them as might another less familiar
with them.</p>

<p>While they had known their destination when they embarked
upon the undertaking, their courage had been high in
direct proportion to the great distance that they had been
from the Wiramwazi, but in proportion as the distance lessened
with each day's march their courage had lessened until
now upon the very threshold of horrors beyond the ken of
human minds the last vestige of self-control had deserted
them and they had fled precipitately.</p>

<p>That they had taken his provisions, his rifles and his ammunition
might have seemed the depth of baseness had von
Harben not realized the sincerity of their belief that there
could be no possible hope for him and that his immediate
death was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>He knew that they had reasoned that under the circumstances
it would be a waste of food to leave it behind for a
man who was already as good as dead when they would need
it for their return journey to their villages, and likewise, as
the weapons of mortal man could avail nothing against the
ghosts of Wiramwazi, it would have been a needless extravagance
to have surrendered fine rifles and quantities of ammunition
that von Harben could not use against his enemies
of the spirit world.</p>

<p>Von Harben stood for some time looking down the mountain
slope toward the forest, somewhere in the depths of
which his men were hastening toward their own country.
That he might overtake them was a possibility, but by no
means a certainty, and if he did not he would be no better
off alone in the jungle than he would be on the slopes of the
Wiramwazi.</p>

<p>He faced about and looked up toward the rugged heights
above him. He had come a long way to reach his goal, which
now lay somewhere just beyond that serrated skyline, and he
was of no mind to turn back now in defeat. A day or a week
in these rugged mountains might reveal the secret of The
Lost Tribe of legend, and surely a month would be sufficient
to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the story had
no basis in fact, for von Harben believed that in a month he
could fairly well explore such portions of the range as might
naturally lend themselves to human habitations, where he
hoped at best to find relics of the fabled tribe in the form of
ruins or burial mounds. For to a man of von Harben's training
and intelligence there could be no thought that The Lost
Tribe of legend, if it had ever existed, could be anything more
than a vague memory surrounding a few mouldy artifacts
and some crumbling bones.</p>

<p>It did not take the young man long to reach a decision
and presently he turned back to his tent and, entering it,
packed a few necessities that had been left to him in a light
haversack, strapped his ammunition belt about him, and
stepped forth once more to turn his face upward toward the
mystery of the Wiramwazi.</p>

<p>In addition to his Luger, von Harben carried a hunting-knife
and with this he presently cut a stout staff from one of
the small trees that grew sparsely upon the mountainside
against the time when he might find an alpenstock indispensable.</p>

<p>A mountain rill furnished him pure, cold water to quench
his thirst, and he carried his pistol cocked, hoping that he
might bag some small game to satisfy his hunger. Nor had
he gone far before a hare broke cover, and as it rolled over
to the crack of the Luger, von Harben gave thanks that he
had devoted much time to perfecting himself in the use of
small arms.</p>

<p>On the spot he built a fire and grilled the hare, after which
he lit his pipe and lay at ease while he smoked and planned.
His was not a temperament to be depressed or discouraged
by seeming reverses, and he was determined not to be hurried
by excitement, but to conserve his strength at all times during
the strenuous days that he felt must lie ahead of him.</p>

<p>All day he climbed, choosing the long way when it seemed
safer, exercising all the lore of mountain-climbing that he
had accumulated, and resting often. Night overtook him well
up toward the summit of the highest ridge that had been
visible from the base of the range. What lay behind, he could
not even guess, but experience suggested that he would find
other ridges and frowning peaks before him.</p>

<p>He had brought a blanket with him from the last camp and
in this he rolled up on the ground. From below there came
the noises of the jungle subdued by distance&mdash;the yapping of
jackals and faintly from afar the roaring of a lion.</p>

<p>Toward morning he was awakened by the scream of a
leopard, not from the jungle far below, but somewhere upon
the mountain slopes nearby. He knew that this savage night
prowler constituted a real menace, perhaps the greatest he
would have to face, and he regretted the loss of his heavy
rifle.</p>

<p>He was not afraid, for he knew that after all there was
little likelihood that the leopard was hunting him or that it
would attack him, but there was always that chance and so to
guard against it he started a fire of dry wood that he had
gathered for the purpose the night before. He found the
warmth of the blaze welcome, for the night had grown cold,
and he sat for some time warming himself.</p>

<p>Once he thought he heard an animal moving in the darkness
beyond the range of the firelight, but he saw no shining
eyes and the sound was not repeated. And then he must have
slept, for the next thing he knew it was daylight and only
embers remained to mark where the beast fire had blazed.</p>

<p>Cold and without breakfast, von Harben continued the
ascent from his cheerless camp, his eyes under the constant
urging of his stomach, always alert for food. The terrain
offered few obstacles to an experienced mountain-climber,
and he even forgot his hunger in the thrill of expectancy in
which he anticipated the possibilities hidden by the ridge
whose summit now lay but a short distance ahead of him.</p>

<p>It is the summit of the ridge that ever lures the explorer
onward. What new sights lie just beyond? What mysteries
will its achievement unveil to the eager eyes of the adventurer?
Judgment and experience joined forces to assure him
that when his eyes surmounted the ridge ahead they would
be rewarded with nothing more startling than another ridge
to be negotiated; yet there was always that other hope hanging
like a shining beacon just below the next horizon, above
which the rays of its hidden light served to illuminate the figments
of his desire, and his imagination transformed the figments
into realities.</p>

<p>Von Harben, sane and phlegmatic as he was, was now
keyed to the highest pitch of excitement as he at last scaled
the final barrier and stood upon the crest of the ridge. Before
him stretched a rolling plateau, dotted with stunted
wind-swept trees, and in the distance lay the next ridge that
he had anticipated, but indistinct and empurpled by the haze
of distance. What lay between him and those far hills? His
pulse quickened at the thought of the possibilities for exploration
and discovery that lay before him, for the terrain
that he looked upon was entirely different from what he had
anticipated. No lofty peaks were visible except in the far
distance, and between him and them there must lie intriguing
ravines and valleys&mdash;virgin fields at the feet of the explorer.</p>

<p>Eagerly, entirely forgetful of his hunger or his solitude,
von Harben moved northward across the plateau. The land
was gently rolling, rock-strewn, sterile, and uninteresting,
and when he had covered a mile of it he commenced to have
misgivings, for if it continued on without change to the dim
hills in the distance, as it now seemed was quite likely the
case, it could offer him neither interest nor sustenance.</p>

<p>As these thoughts were commencing to oppress him, he
became suddenly conscious of a vague change in the appearance
of the terrain ahead. It was only an impression of
unreality. The hills far away before him seemed to rise out
of a great void, and it was as though between him and them
there existed nothing. He might have been looking across an
inland sea to distant, hazy shores&mdash;a waterless sea, for nowhere
was there any suggestion of water&mdash;and then suddenly
he came to a halt, startled, amazed. The rolling plateau ceased
abruptly at his feet, and below him, stretching far to the distant
hills, lay a great abyss&mdash;a mighty canyon similar to that
which has made the gorge of the Colorado world-famous.</p>

<p>But here there was a marked difference. There were indications
of erosion. The grim walls were scarred and water-worn.
Towers and turrets and minarets, carved from the
native granite, pointed upward from below, but they clung
close to the canyon's wall, and just beyond them he could see
the broad expanse of the floor of the canyon, which from
his great height above it appeared as level as a billiard table.
The scene held him in a hypnosis of wonderment and admiration
as, at first swiftly and then slowly, his eyes encompassed
the whole astounding scene.</p>

<p>Perhaps a mile below him lay the floor of the sunken
canyon, the farther wall of which he could but vaguely
estimate to be somewhere between fifteen and twenty miles
to the north, and this he realized was the lesser dimension of
the canyon. Upon his right, to the east, and upon his left, to
the west, he could see that the canyon extended to considerable
distances&mdash;just how far he could not guess. He thought
that to the east he could trace the wall that hemmed it upon
that side, but from where he stood the entire extent of the
canyon to the west was not visible, yet he knew that the floor
that was visible to him must stretch fully twenty-five or thirty
miles from east to west. Almost below him was a large lake
or marsh that seemed to occupy the greater part of the east
end of the canyon. He could see lanes of water winding
through what appeared to be great growths of reeds and,
nearer the northern shore, a large island. Three streams,
winding ribbons far below, emptied into the lake, and in the
far distance was another ribbon that might be a road. To the
west the canyon was heavily wooded, and between the forest
and the lake he saw moving figures of what he thought to be
grazing game.</p>

<p>The sight below him aroused the enthusiasm of the explorer
to its highest pitch. Here, doubtless, lay the secret of
The Lost Tribe of the Wiramwazi and how well Nature had
guarded this secret with stupendous barrier cliffs, aided by
the superstitions of the ignorant black inhabitants of the
outer slopes, was now easily understandable.</p>

<p>As far as he could see, the cliffs seemed sheer and impossible
of descent, and yet he knew that he must find a way&mdash;that
he would find a way down into the valley of enchantment.</p>

<p>Moving slowly along the rim he sought some foothold,
however slight, where Nature had lowered her guard, but it
was almost night and he had covered but a short distance
before he found even a suggestion of hope that the canyon
was hemmed at any point by other than unbroken cliffs,
whose perpendicular faces rose at their lowest point fully a
thousand feet above any possible foothold for a human
being.</p>

<p>The sun had already set when he discovered a narrow
fissure in the granite wall. Crumbled fragments of the mother
rock had fallen into and partially filled it so that near the
surface, at least, it offered a means of descent below the level
of the cliff top, but in the gathering darkness he could not
determine how far downward this rough and precarious
pathway led.</p>

<p>He could see that below him the cliffs rose in terraced
battlements to within a thousand feet of where he stood, and
if the narrow fissure extended to the next terrace below him,
he felt that the obstacles thereafter would present fewer difficulties
than those that had baffled him up to the present time&mdash;for
while he would still have some four thousand feet to
descend, the formation of the cliffs was much more broken
at the foot of the first sheer drop and consequently might be
expected to offer some avenues of descent of which an experienced
mountain-climber could take advantage.</p>

<p>Hungry and cold, he sat beneath the descending night,
gazing down into the blackening void below. Presently, as the
darkness deepened, he saw a light twinkling far below and
then another and another and with each his excitement rose,
for he knew that they marked the presence of man. In many
places upon the marsh-like lake he saw the fires twinkling,
and at a point which he took to mark the site of the island
there were many lights.</p>

<p>What sort of men were they who tended these fires? Would
he find them friendly or hostile. Were they but another tribe
of African blacks, or could it be that the old legend was
based upon truth and that far below him white men of The
Lost Tribe cooked their evening meals above those tantalizing
fires of mystery?</p>

<p>What was that? Von Harben strained his ears to catch the
faint suggestion of a sound that arose out of the shadowy
abyss below&mdash;a faint, thin sound that barely reached his ears,
but he was sure that he could not be mistaken&mdash;the sound
was the voices of men.</p>

<p>And now from out of the valley came the scream of a
beast and again a roar that rumbled upward like distant
thunder. To the music of these sounds, von Harben finally
succumbed to exhaustion; sleep for the moment offering him
relief from cold and hunger.</p>

<p>When morning came he gathered wood from the stunted
trees nearby and built a fire to warm himself. He had no
food, nor all the previous day since he had reached the summit
had he seen any sign of a living creature other than the
game a mile beneath him on the verdant meadows of the
canyon bottom.</p>

<p>He knew that he must have food and have it soon and food
lay but a mile away in one direction. If he sought to circle
the canyon in search of an easier avenue of descent, he knew
that he might not find one in the hundred miles or more that
he must travel. Of course he might turn back. He was sure
that he could reach the base of the outer slopes of the Wiramwazi,
where he knew that game might be found before
exhaustion overcame him, but he had no mind to turn back
and the thought of failure was only a vague suggestion that
scarcely ever rose above the threshold of his conscious mind.</p>

<p>Having warmed himself before the fire, he turned to
examine the fissure by the full light of day. As he stood upon
its brink he could see that it extended downward for several
hundred feet, but there it disappeared. However, he was by
no means sure that it ended, since it was not a vertical cleft,
but tilted slightly from the perpendicular.</p>

<p>From where he stood he could see that there were places
in the fissure where descent would be just possible, though
it might be very difficult to reascend. He knew, therefore,
that should he reach the bottom of the fissure and find that
further descent was impossible he would be caught in a trap
from which there might be no escape.</p>

<p>Although he felt as fit and strong as ever, he realized perfectly
that the contrary was the fact and that his strength
must be ebbing and that it would continue to ebb still more
rapidly the longer that he was forced to expend it in arduous
efforts to descend the cliff and without any possibility of rebuilding
it with food.</p>

<p>Even to Erich von Harben, young, self-confident and enthusiastic,
his next step seemed little better than suicidal. To
another the mere idea of attempting the descent of these
towering cliffs would have seemed madness, but in other
mountains von Harben had always found a way, and with
this thin thread upon which to hang his hopes he faced the
descent into the unknown. Now he was just about to lower
himself over the edge of the fissure when he heard the sounds
of footsteps behind him. Wheeling quickly, he drew his
Luger.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Nkima came racing through the tree tops, jabbering
excitedly, and dropped to the knee of Tarzan of the Apes,
where the latter lay stretched upon the great branch of a
jungle giant, his back against the rough bole, where he was
lying up after making a kill and feeding.</p>

<p>"Gomangani! Gomangani!" shrilled Nkima. "They come!
They come!"</p>

<p>"Peace," said Tarzan. "You are a greater nuisance than all
the Gomangani in the jungle."</p>

<p>"They will kill little Nkima," cried the monkey. "They are
strange Gomangani, and there are no Tarmangani among
them."</p>

<p>"Nkima thinks everything wants to kill him," said Tarzan,
"and yet he has lived many years and is not dead yet."</p>

<p>"Sabor and Sheeta and Numa, the Gomangani, and Histah
the snake like to eat poor little Nkima," wailed the monkey.
"That is why he is afraid."</p>

<p>"Do not fear, Nkima," said the ape-man. "Tarzan will let
no one hurt you."</p>

<p>"Go and see the Gomangani," urged Nkima. "Go and kill
them. Nkima does not like the Gomangani."</p>

<p>Tarzan rose leisurely. "I go," he said. "Nkima may come
or he may hide in the upper terraces."</p>

<p>"Nkima is not afraid," blustered the little monkey. "He
will go and fight the Gomangani with Tarzan of the Apes,"
and he leaped to the back of the ape-man and clung there
with his arms about the bronzed throat, from which point of
vantage he peered fearfully ahead, first over the top of one
broad shoulder and then over the top of the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan swung swiftly and quietly through the trees toward
a point where Nkima had discovered the blacks, and presently
he saw below him some score of natives straggling along
the jungle trail. A few of them were armed with rifles and
all carried packs of various sizes&mdash;such packs as Tarzan knew
must belong to the equipment of a white man.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle hailed them and, startled, the
blacks halted, looking up fearfully.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes. Do not be afraid," Tarzan reassured
them, and simultaneously he dropped lightly to the
trail among them, but as he did so Nkima leaped frantically
from his shoulders and scampered swiftly to a high branch
far above, where he sat chattering and scolding, entirely forgetful
of his vain boasting of a few moments before.</p>

<p>"Where is your master?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>The blacks looked sullenly at the ground, but did not
reply.</p>

<p>"Where is the Bwana, von Harben?" Tarzan insisted.</p>

<p>A tall black standing near fidgeted uneasily. "He is dead,"
he mumbled.</p>

<p>"How did he die?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Again the black hesitated before replying. "A bull elephant
that he had wounded killed him," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Where is his body?"</p>

<p>"We could not find it."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know that he was killed by a bull
elephant?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We do not know," spoke up another black. "He went
away from camp and did not return."</p>

<p>"There was an elephant about and we thought that it had
killed him," said the first black.</p>

<p>"You are not speaking true words," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you the truth," said a third black. "Our Bwana
ascended the slopes of the Wiramwazi and the spirits of the
dead being angry seized him and carried him away."</p>

<p>"I shall tell you the truth," said Tarzan. "You have deserted
your master and run away, leaving him alone in the
forest."</p>

<p>"We were afraid," said the third black. "We warned him
not to ascend the slopes of the Wiramwazi. We begged him
to turn back. He would not listen to us, and the spirits of the
dead carried him away."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Six, seven, perhaps ten marchings. I do not remember."</p>

<p>"Where was he when you last saw him?"</p>

<p>As accurately as they could the blacks described the location
of their last camp upon the slopes of the Wiramwazi.</p>

<p>"Go your way back to your own villages in the Urambi
country. I shall know where to find you if I want you. If
your Bwana is dead, you shall be punished," and swinging
into the branches of the lower terrace, Tarzan disappeared
from the sight of the unhappy blacks in the direction of the
Wiramwazi, while Nkima, screaming shrilly, raced through
the trees to overtake him.</p>

<p>From his conversation with the deserting members of von
Harben's safari, Tarzan was convinced that the young man
had been traitorously abandoned and that in all likelihood
he was making his way alone back upon the trail of the
deserters.</p>

<p>Not knowing Erich von Harben, Tarzan could not have
guessed that the young man would push on alone into the
unknown and forbidding depths of the Wiramwazi, but assumed
on the contrary that he would adopt the more prudent
alternative and seek to overtake his men as rapidly as
possible. Believing this, the ape-man followed back along the
trail of the blacks, expecting momentarily to meet von
Harben.</p>

<p>This plan greatly reduced his speed, but even so he
travelled with so much greater rapidity than the blacks that
he came to the slopes of the Wiramwazi upon the third day
after he had interviewed the remnants of von Harben's
safari.</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that he finally located the point
at which von Harben had been abandoned by his men, as a
heavy rain and windstorm had obliterated the trail, but at
last he stumbled upon the tent, which had blown down, but
nowhere could he see any signs of von Harben's trail.</p>

<p>Not having come upon any signs of the white man in the
jungle or any indication that he had followed his fleeing
safari, Tarzan was forced to the conclusion that if von Harben
was not indeed dead he must have faced the dangers of
the unknown alone and now be either dead or alive somewhere
within the mysterious fastnesses of the Wiramwazi.</p>

<p>"Nkima," said the ape-man, "the Tarmangani have a saying
that when it is futile to search for a thing, it is like hunting
for a needle in a haystack. Do you believe, Nkima, that
in this great mountain range we shall find our needle?"</p>

<p>"Let us go home," said Nkima, "where it is warm. Here
the wind blows and up there it is colder. It is no place for
little Manu, the monkey."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Nkima, there is where we are going."</p>

<p>The monkey looked up toward the frowning heights above.
"Little Nkima is afraid," he said. "It is in such places that
Sheeta, the panther, lairs."</p>

<p>Ascending diagonally and in a westerly direction in the
hope of crossing von Harben's trail, Tarzan moved constantly
in the opposite direction from that taken by the man he
sought. It was his intention, however, when he reach the summit,
if he had in the meantime found no trace of von Harben,
to turn directly eastward and search at a higher altitude in
the opposite direction. As he proceeded, the slope became
steeper and more rugged until at one point near the western
end of the mountain mass he encountered an almost perpendicular
barrier high up on the mountainside along the
base of which he picked his precarious way among loose
boulders that had fallen from above. Underbrush and stunted
trees extended at different points from the forest below
quite up to the base of the vertical escarpment.</p>

<p>So engrossed was the ape-man in the dangerous business
of picking his way along the mountainside that he gave little
heed to anything beyond the necessities of the trail and his
constant search for the spoor of von Harben, and so did not
see the little group of black warriors that were gazing up at
him from the shelter of a clump of trees far down the slope,
nor did Nkima, usually as alert as his master, have eyes or
ears for anything beyond the immediate exigencies of the
trail. Nkima was unhappy. The wind blew and Nkima did
not like the wind. All about him he smelled the spoor of
Sheeta, the panther, while he considered the paucity and
stunted nature of the few trees along the way that his master
had chosen. From time to time he noted, with sinking heart,
ledges just above them from which Sheeta might spring down
upon them; and the way was a way of terror for little
Nkima.</p>

<p>Now they had come to a particularly precarious point
upon the mountainside. A sheer cliff rose above them on their
right and at their left the mountainside fell away so steeply
that as Tarzan advanced his body was pressed closely against
the granite face of the cliff as he sought a foothold upon the
ledge of loose rubble. Just ahead of them the cliff shouldered
out boldly against the distant skies. Perhaps beyond that
clear-cut corner the going might be better. If it should develop
that it was worse, Tarzan realized that he must turn
back.</p>

<p>At the turn where the footing was narrowest a stone gave
beneath Tarzan's foot, throwing him off balance for an instant
and at that same instant Nkima, thinking that Tarzan
was falling, shrieked and leaped from his shoulder, giving the
ape-man's body just the impetus that was required to overbalance
it entirely.</p>

<p>The mountainside below was steep, though not perpendicular,
and if Nkima had not pushed the ape-man outward he
doubtless would have slid but a short distance before being
able to stay his fall, but as it was he lunged headforemost
down the embankment, rolling and tumbling for a short distance
over the loose rock until his body was brought to a
stop by one of the many stunted trees that clung tenaciously
to the wind-swept slope.</p>

<p>Terrified, Nkima scampered to his master's side. He
screamed and chattered in his ear and pulled and tugged
upon him in an effort to raise him, but the ape-man lay
motionless, a tiny stream of blood trickling from a cut on
his temple into his shock of black hair.</p>

<p>As Nkima mourned, the black warriors, who had been
watching them from below, clambered quickly up the mountainside
toward him and his helpless master.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">As</span> Erich von Harben turned to face the thing that he had
heard approaching behind him, he saw a negro armed with a
rifle coming toward him.</p>

<p>"Gabula!" exclaimed the white man, lowering his weapon.
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Bwana," said the black, "I could not desert you. I could
not leave you to die alone at the hands of the spirits that
dwell upon these mountains."</p>

<p>Von Harben eyed the negro incredulously. "But if you
believe that, Gabula, are you not afraid that they will kill
you, too?"</p>

<p>"I expect to die, Bwana," replied Gabula. "I cannot understand
why you were not killed the first night or the second
night. We shall both surely be killed tonight."</p>

<p>"And yet you followed me! Why?"</p>

<p>"You have been kind to me, Bwana," replied the black.
"Your father has been kind to me. When the others talked
they filled me with fear and when they ran away I went with
them, but I have come back. There was nothing else that I
could do, was there?"</p>

<p>"No, Gabula. For you or for me there would have been
nothing else to do, as we see such things, but as the others
saw them they found another thing to do and they did it."</p>

<p>"Gabula is not as the others," said the black, proudly.
"Gabula is a Batoro."</p>

<p>"Gabula is a brave warrior," said von Harben. "I do not
believe in spirits and so that was no reason why I should be
afraid, but you and all your people do believe in them and
so it was a very brave thing for you to come back, but I
shall not hold you. You may return, Gabula, with the others."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Gabula exclaimed eagerly. "The Bwana is going
back? That will be good. Gabula will go back with him."</p>

<p>"No, I am going down into that canyon," said von Harben,
pointing over the rim.</p>

<p>Gabula looked down, surprise and wonder reflected by his
wide eyes and parted lips.</p>

<p>"But, Bwana, even if a human being could find a way
down these steep cliffs, where there is no place for either
hand or foot, he would surely be killed the moment he
reached the bottom, for this indeed must be the Land of the
Lost Tribe where the spirits of the dead live in the heart of
the Wiramwazi."</p>

<p>"You do not need to come with me, Gabula," said von
Harben. "Go back to your people."</p>

<p>"How are you going to get down there?" demanded the
black.</p>

<p>"I do not know just how, or where, or when. Now I am
going to descend as far along this fissure as I can go. Perhaps
I shall find my way down here, perhaps not."</p>

<p>"But suppose there is no foothold beyond the fissure?"
asked Gabula.</p>

<p>"I shall have to find footing."</p>

<p>Gabula shook his head. "And if you reach the bottom,
Bwana, and you are right about the spirits and there are
none or they do not kill you, how will you get out again?"</p>

<p>Von Harben shrugged his shoulders and smiled. Then he
extended his hand. "Goodbye, Gabula," he said. "You are
a brave man."</p>

<p>Gabula did not take the offered hand of his master. "I am
going with you," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Even though you realize that should we reach the bottom
alive we may never be able to return?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you, Gabula. You are afraid and I
know that you wish to return to the village of your people.
Then why do you insist on coming with me when I give you
leave to return home?"</p>

<p>"I have sworn to serve you, Bwana, and I am a Batoro,"
replied Gabula.</p>

<p>"And I can only thank the Lord that you are a Batoro,"
said von Harben, "for the Lord knows that I shall need help
before I reach the bottom of this canyon, and we must reach
it, Gabula, unless we are content to die of starvation."</p>

<p>"I have brought food," said Gabula. "I knew that you
might be hungry and I brought some of the food that you
like," and, unrolling the small pack that he carried, he displayed
several bars of chocolate and a few packages of
concentrated food that von Harben had included among his
supplies in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>To the famished von Harben, the food was like manna to
the Israelites, and he lost no time in taking advantage of
Gabula's thoughtfulness. The sharp edge of his hunger removed,
von Harben experienced a feeling of renewed strength
and hopefulness, and it was with a light heart and a buoyant
optimism that he commenced the descent into the canyon.</p>

<p>Gabula's ancestry, stretching back through countless generations
of jungle-dwelling people, left him appalled as he
contemplated the frightful abyss into which his master was
leading him, but so deeply had he involved himself by his
protestations of loyalty and tribal pride that he followed von
Harben with no outward show of the real terror that was
consuming him.</p>

<p>The descent through the fissure was less difficult than it
had appeared from above. The tumbled rocks that had
partially filled it gave more than sufficient footing and on
only a few places was assistance required, and it was at these
times that von Harben realized how fortunate for him had
been Gabula's return.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the bottom of the cleft they
found themselves at its outer opening, flush with the face of
the cliff and several hundred feet below the rim. This was the
point beyond which von Harben had been unable to see and
which he had been approaching with deep anxiety, since there
was every likelihood that the conditions here might put a
period to their further descent along this route.</p>

<p>Creeping over the loose rubble in the bottom of the fissure
to its outer edge, von Harben discovered a sheer drop of a
hundred feet to the level of the next terrace and his heart
sank. To return the way they had come was, he feared, a
feat beyond their strength and ingenuity, for there had been
places down which one had lowered the other only with the
greatest difficulty, which would be practically unscalable on
the return journey.</p>

<p>It being impossible to ascend and as starvation surely faced
them where they were, there was but one alternative. Von
Harben lay upon his belly, his eyes at the outer edge of the
fissure, and instructing Gabula to hold tightly to his ankles,
he wormed himself forward until he could scan the entire
face of cliff below him to the level of the next terrace.</p>

<p>A few feet from the level on which he lay he saw that the
fissure lay open again to the base of the cliff, its stoppage at
the point where they were having been caused by a large
fragment of rock that had wedged securely between the sides
of the fissure, entirely choking it at this point.</p>

<p>The fissure, which had narrowed considerably since they
had entered it at the summit, was not more than two or three
feet wide directly beneath the rock on which he lay and
extended with little variation at this width the remaining
hundred feet to the comparatively level ground below.</p>

<p>If he and Gabula could but get into this crevice he knew
that they could easily brace themselves against its sides in
such a way as to descend safely the remaining distance, but
how with the means at hand were they to climb over the
edge of the rock that blocked the fissure and crawl back into
the fissure again several feet farther down?</p>

<p>Von Harben lowered his crude alpenstock over the edge of
the rock fragment. When he extended his arms at full length
the tip of the rod fell considerably below the bottom of the
rocks on which he lay. A man hanging at the end of the
alpenstock might conceivably swing into the fissure, but it
would necessitate a feat of acrobatics far beyond the powers
of either himself or Gabula.</p>

<p>A rope would have solved their problem, but they had no
rope. With a sigh, von Harben drew back when his examination
of the fissure convinced him that he must find another
way, but he was totally at a loss to imagine in which direction
to look for a solution.</p>

<p>Gabula crouched back in the fissure, terrified by the anticipation
of what von Harben's attempted exploration had
suggested. The very thought of even looking out over the
edge of that rock beyond the face of the cliff left Gabula
cold and half paralysed, while the thought that he might have
to follow von Harben bodily over the edge threw the negro
into a fit of trembling; yet had von Harben gone over the
edge Gabula would have followed him.</p>

<p>The white man sat for a long time buried in thought. Time
and again his eyes examined every detail of the formation of
the fissure within the range of his vision. Again and again
they returned to the huge fragment upon which they sat,
which was securely wedged between the fissure's sides. With
this out of the way he felt that they could make unimpeded
progress to the next terrace, but he knew that nothing short
of a charge of dynamite could budge the heavy granite slab.
Directly behind it were loose fragments of various sizes, and
as his eyes returned to them once again he was struck with
the possibility that they suggested.</p>

<p>"Come, Gabula," he said. "Help me throw out some of
these rocks. This seems to be our only possible hope of
escaping from the trap that I have got us into."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," replied Gabula, and fell to work beside von
Harben, though he could not understand why they should be
picking up these stones, some of which were very heavy, and
pushing them out over the edge of the flat fragment that
clogged the fissure.</p>

<p>He heard them crash heavily where they struck the rocks
below and this interested and fascinated him to such an
extent that he worked feverishly to loosen the larger blocks
of stone for the added pleasure he derived from hearing the
loud noise that they made when they struck.</p>

<p>"It begins to look," said von Harben, after a few minutes,
"as though we may be going to succeed, unless by removing
these rocks here we cause some of those above to slide down
and thus loosen the whole mass above us&mdash;in which event,
Gabula, the mystery of The Lost Tribe will cease to interest
us longer."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," said Gabula, and lifting an unusually large
rock he started to roll it toward the edge of the fissure.
"Look! Look, Bwana!" he exclaimed, pointing at the place
where the rock had lain.</p>

<p>Von Harben looked and saw an opening about the size of
a man's head extending into the fissure beneath them.</p>

<p>"Thank Nsenene, the grasshopper, Gabula," cried the white
man, "if that is the totem of your clan&mdash;for here indeed is a
way to salvation."</p>

<p>Hurriedly the two men set to work to enlarge the hole by
throwing out other fragments that had long been wedged in
together to close the fissure at this point, and as the fragments
clattered down the rocks below, a tall, straight warrior standing
in the bow of a dugout upon the marshy lake far below
looked up and called the attention of his comrades.</p>

<p>They could plainly hear the reverberations of the falling
fragments as they struck the rocks at the foot of the fissure
and, keen-eyed, they could see many of the larger pieces that
von Harben and Gabula tossed downward.</p>

<p>"The great wall is falling," said the black warrior.</p>

<p>"A few pebbles," said another. "It is nothing."</p>

<p>"Such things do not happen except after rains," said the
first speaker. "It is thus that it is prophesied that the great
wall will fall."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a demon who lives in the great rift in the
wall," said another. "Let us hasten and tell the masters."</p>

<p>"Let us wait and watch," said the first speaker, "until we
have something to tell them. If we went and told them that a
few rocks had fallen from the great wall they would only
laugh at us."</p>

<p>Von Harben and Gabula had increased the size of the
opening until it was large enough to permit the passage of a
man's body. Through it the white man could see the rough
sides of the fissure extending to the level of the next terrace
and knew that the next stage of the descent was already as
good as an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>"We shall descend one at a time, Gabula," said von Harben.
"I shall go first, for I am accustomed to this sort of
climbing. Watch carefully so that you may descend exactly
as I do. It is easy and there is no danger. Be sure that you
keep your back braced against one wall and your feet against
the other. We shall lose some hide in the descent, for the
walls are rough, but we shall get down safely enough if we
take it slowly."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana. You go first," said Gabula. "If I see you do
it then, perhaps, I can do it."</p>

<p>Von Harben lowered himself through the aperture, braced
himself securely against the opposite walls of the fissure, and
started slowly downward. A few minutes later Gabula saw
his master standing safely at the bottom, and though his heart
was in his mouth the black followed without hesitation, but
when he stood at last beside von Harben he breathed such a
loud sigh of relief that von Harben was forced to laugh
aloud.</p>

<p>"It is the demon himself," said the black warrior in the
dugout, as von Harben had stepped from the fissure.</p>

<p>From where the dugout of the watchers floated, half concealed
by lofty papyrus, the terrace at the base of the fissure
was just visible. They saw von Harben emerge and a few
moments later the figure of Gabula.</p>

<p>"Now indeed," said one of the blacks, "we should hasten
and tell the masters."</p>

<p>"No," said the first speaker. "Those two may be demons,
but they look like men and we shall wait until we know
what they are and why they are here before we go away."</p>

<p>For a thousand feet the descent from the base of the
fissure was far from difficult, a rough slope leading in an
easterly direction down toward the canyon bottom. During
the descent their view of the lake and of the canyon was
often completely shut off by masses of weather-worn granite
around which they sometimes had difficulty in finding a way.
As a rule the easiest descent lay between these towering fragments
of the main body of cliff, and at such times as the
valley was hidden from them so were they hidden from the
watchers on the lake.</p>

<p>A third of the way down the escarpment von Harben came
to the verge of a narrow gorge, the bottom of which was
densely banked with green foliage of trees growing luxuriantly,
pointing unquestionably to the presence of water in
abundance. Leading the way, von Harben descended into the
gorge, at the bottom of which he found a spring from which
a little stream trickled downward. Here they quenched their
thirst and rested. Then, following the stream downward, they
discovered no obstacles that might not be easily surmounted.</p>

<p>For a long time, hemmed in by the walls of the narrow
gorge and their view further circumscribed by the forest-like
growth along the banks of the stream, they had no sight of
the lake or the canyon bottom, but, finally, when the gorge
debouched upon the lower slopes von Harben halted in admiration
of the landscape spread out before him. Directly
below, another stream entered that along which they had
descended, forming a little river that dropped steeply to what
appeared to be vivid green meadow land through which it
wound tortuously to the great swamp that extended out
across the valley for perhaps ten miles.</p>

<p>So choked was the lake with some feathery-tipped aquatic
plant that von Harben could only guess as to its extent, since
the green of the water plant and the green of the surrounding
meadows blended into one another, but here and there he
saw signs of open water that appeared like winding lanes or
passages leading in all directions throughout the marsh.</p>

<p>As von Harben and Gabula stood looking out across this
(to them) new and mysterious world, the black warriors in
the dugout watched them attentively. The strangers were still
so far away that the blacks were unable to identify them, but
their leader assured them that these two were no demons.</p>

<p>"How do you know that they are not demons?" demanded
one of these fellows.</p>

<p>"I can see that they are men," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Demons are very wise and very powerful," insisted the
doubter. "They may take any form they choose. They might
come as birds or animals or men."</p>

<p>"They are not fools," snapped the leader. "If a demon
wished to descend the great wall he would not choose the
hardest way. He would take the form of a bird and fly
down."</p>

<p>The other scratched his head in perplexity, for he realized
that here was an argument that would be difficult to controvert.
For want of anything better to say, he suggested that
they go at once and report the matter to their masters.</p>

<p>"No," said the leader. "We shall remain here until they
come closer. It will be better for us if we can take them with
us and show them to our masters."</p>

<p>The first few steps that von Harben took on to the grassy
meadow land revealed the fact that it was a dangerous
swamp from which only with the greatest difficulty were they
able to extricate themselves.</p>

<p>Floundering back to solid ground, von Harben reconnoitred
in search of some other avenue to more solid ground
on the floor of the canyon, but he found that upon both sides
of the river the swamp extended to the foot of the lowest
terrace of the cliff, and low as these were in comparison to
their lofty fellows towering far above them, they were still
impassable barriers.</p>

<p>Possibly by reascending the gorge he might find an avenue
to more solid ground toward the west, but as he had no
actual assurance of this and as both he and Gabula were
well-nigh exhausted from the physical strain of the descent,
he preferred to find an easier way to the lake-shore if it were
possible.</p>

<p>He saw that while the river at this point was not swift, the
current was rapid enough to suggest that the bottom might
be sufficiently free from mud to make it possible for them to
utilize it as an avenue to the lake, if it were not too deep.</p>

<p>To test the feasibility of the idea, he lowered himself into
the water, holding to one end of his alpenstock, while
Gabula seized the other. He found that the water came to his
waist-line and that the bottom was firm and solid.</p>

<p>"Come on, Gabula. This is our way to the lake, I think,"
he said to the black.</p>

<p>As Gabula slipped into the water behind his master, the
dugout containing the black warriors pushed silently along
the watery lane among the papyrus and with silent paddles
was urged swiftly toward the mouth of the stream where it
emptied into the lake.</p>

<p>As von Harben and Gabula descended the stream they
found that the depth of the water did not greatly increase.
Once or twice they stumbled into deeper holes and were
forced to swim, but in other places the water shallowed until
it was only to their knees, and thus they made their way
down to the lake at the verge of which their view was shut
off by clumps of papyrus rising twelve or fifteen feet above
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"It begins to look," said von Harben, "as though there is
no solid ground along the shore line, but the roots of the
papyrus will hold us and if we can make our way to the
west end of the lake I am sure that we shall find solid ground,
for I am positive that I saw higher land there as we were
descending the cliff."</p>

<p>Feeling their way cautiously along, they came at last to the
first clump of papyrus and just as von Harben was about to
clamber to the solid footing of the roots, a canoe shot from
behind the mass of floating plants and the two men found
themselves covered by weapons of a boatload of ebon
warriors.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Lukedi</span>, the Bagego, carried a gourd of milk to a hut in the
village of his people on the lower slopes at the west end of
the Wiramwazi range.</p>

<p>Two stalwart spearmen stood guard at the doorway of the
hut. "Nyuto has sent me with milk for the prisoner," said
Lukedi. "Has his spirit returned to him?"</p>

<p>"Go in and see," directed one of the sentries.</p>

<p>Lukedi entered the hut and in the dim light saw the figure
of a giant white man sitting upon the dirt floor gazing at
him. The man's wrists were bound together behind his back
and his ankles were secured with tough fibre strands.</p>

<p>"Here is food," said Lukedi, setting the gourd upon the
ground near the prisoner.</p>

<p>"How can I eat with my hands tied behind my back?"
demanded Tarzan. Lukedi scratched his head. "I do not
know," he said. "Nyuto sent me with the food. He did not
tell me to free your hands."</p>

<p>"Cut the bonds," said Tarzan, "otherwise I cannot eat."</p>

<p>One of the spearmen entered the hut. "What is he saying?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"He says he cannot eat unless his hands are freed," said
Lukedi.</p>

<p>"Did Nyuto tell you to free his hands?" asked the spearman.</p>

<p>"No," said Lukedi.</p>

<p>The spearman shrugged his shoulders. "Leave the food
then; that is all you were asked to do."</p>

<p>Lukedi turned to leave the hut. "Wait," said Tarzan. "Who
is Nyuto?"</p>

<p>"He is chief of the Bagegos," said Lukedi.</p>

<p>"Go to him and tell him that I wish to see him. Tell him
also that I cannot eat with my hands tied behind my back."</p>

<p>Lukedi was gone for half an hour. When he returned he
brought an old, rusted slave chain and an ancient padlock.</p>

<p>"Nyuto says that we may chain him to the centre pole and
then cut the bonds that secure his hands," he said to the
guard.</p>

<p>The three men entered the hut where Lukedi passed one
end of the chain around the centre pole, pulling it through a
ring on the other end; the free end he then passed round
Tarzan's neck, securing it there with the old slave padlock.</p>

<p>"Cut the bonds that hold his wrists," said Lukedi to one
of the spearmen.</p>

<p>"Do it yourself," retorted the warrior. "Nyuto sent you to
do it. He did not tell me to cut the bonds."</p>

<p>Lukedi hesitated. It was apparent that he was afraid.</p>

<p>"We will stand ready with our spears," said the guardsman;
"then he cannot harm you."</p>

<p>"I shall not harm him," said Tarzan. "Who are you anyway
and who do you think I am?"</p>

<p>One of the guardsmen laughed. "He asked who we are as
though he did not know!"</p>

<p>"We know who you are, very well," said the other warrior.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," said the prisoner, "and I have
no quarrel with the Bagegos."</p>

<p>The guardsman who had last spoken laughed again derisively.
"That may be your name," he said. "You men of The
Lost Tribe have strange names. Perhaps you have no quarrel
with the Bagegos, but the Bagegos have a quarrel with you,"
and still laughing he left the hut followed by his companion,
but the youth Lukedi remained, apparently fascinated by the
prisoner at whom he stood staring as he might have stared at
a deity.</p>

<p>Tarzan reached for the gourd and drank the milk it contained,
and never once did Lukedi take his eyes from him.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Lukedi," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"And you have never heard of Tarzan of the Apes?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"Who do you think I am?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We know that you belong to The Lost Tribe."</p>

<p>"But I thought the members of The Lost Tribe were supposed
to be the spirits of the dead," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That we do not know," replied Lukedi. "Some think one
way, some another; but you know, for you are one of
them."</p>

<p>"I am not one of them," said Tarzan. "I come from a
country farther south, but I have heard of the Bagegos and
I have heard of The Lost Tribe."</p>

<p>"I do not believe you," said Lukedi.</p>

<p>"I speak the truth," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Lukedi scratched his head. "Perhaps you do," he said. "You
do not wear clothes like the members of The Lost Tribe, and
the weapons that we found with you are different."</p>

<p>"You have seen members of The Lost Tribe?" asked
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Many times," replied Lukedi. "Once a year they come
out of the bowels of the Wiramwazi and trade with us. They
bring dried fish, snails, and iron and take in exchange salt,
goats, and cows."</p>

<p>"If they come and trade with you peacefully, why do you
make me a prisoner if you think I am one of them?" demanded
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning we have been at war with the members
of The Lost Tribe," replied Lukedi. "It is true that once
a year we trade with them, but they are always our enemies."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Because at other times we cannot tell when they will
come with many warriors and capture men, women, and
children whom they take away with them into the Wiramwazi.
None ever returns. We do not know what becomes of
them. Perhaps they are eaten."</p>

<p>"What will your chief, Nyuto, do with me?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Lukedi. "They are discussing the
question now. They all wish to put you to death, but there
are some who believe that this would arouse the anger of
the ghosts of all the dead Bagegos."</p>

<p>"Why should the ghosts of your dead wish to protect me?"
demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"There are many who think that you members of The Lost
Tribe are the ghosts of our dead," replied Lukedi.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Lukedi?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"When I look at you I think you are a man of flesh and
blood the same as I, and I think that perhaps you are telling
me the truth when you say that you are not a member of
The Lost Tribe, because I am sure that they are all ghosts."</p>

<p>"But when they come to trade with you and when they
come to fight with you, can you not tell whether they are
flesh and blood or not?"</p>

<p>"They are very powerful," said Lukedi. "They might come
in the form of men in the flesh or they might come as snakes
or lions. That is why we are not sure."</p>

<p>"And what do you think the council will decide to do with
me?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I think that there is no doubt but that they will burn you
alive, for thus both you and your spirit will be destroyed so
that it cannot come back to haunt and annoy us."</p>

<p>"Have you seen or heard of another white man recently?"
asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No," replied the youth. "Many years ago, before I can
remember, two white men came who said that they were not
members of The Lost Tribe, but we did not believe them and
they were killed. I must go now. I shall bring you more milk
tomorrow."</p>

<p>After Lukedi had left, Tarzan commenced examining the
chain, padlock, and the centre pole of the hut in an effort to
discover some means of escape. The hut was cylindrical and
surmounted by a conical roof of grass. The side walls were
of stakes set upright a few inches in the ground and fastened
together at their tops and bottoms by creepers. The centre
pole was much heavier and was secured in position by rafters
radiating from it to the top of the wall. The interior of the
hut was plastered with mud, which had been thrown on with
force and then smoothed with the palm of the hand. It was a
common type with which Tarzan was familiar. He knew that
there was a possibility that he might be able to raise the
centre pole and withdraw the chain from beneath it.</p>

<p>It would, of course, be difficult to accomplish this without
attracting the attention of the guards, and there was a possibility
that the centre pole might be set sufficiently far in the
ground to render it impossible for him to raise it. If he were
given time he could excavate around the base of it, but inasmuch
as one or the other of the sentries was continually
poking his head into the hut to see that all was well, Tarzan
saw little likelihood of his being able to free himself without
being discovered.</p>

<p>As darkness settled upon the village Tarzan stretched himself
upon the hard dirt floor of the hut and sought to sleep.
For some time the noises of the village kept him awake, but
at last he slept. How long thereafter it was that he was
awakened he did not know. From childhood he had shared
with the beasts, among whom he had been raised, the ability
to awaken quickly and in full command of all his faculties.
He did so now, immediately conscious that the noise that had
aroused him came from an animal upon the roof of the hut.
Whatever it was, it was working quietly, but to what end the
ape-man could not imagine.</p>

<p>The acrid fumes of the village cook fires so filled the air
that Tarzan was unable to catch the scent of the creature
upon the roof. He carefully reviewed all the possible purposes
for which an animal might be upon the thatched, dry-grass
roof of the Bagego hut and through a process of elimination
he could reach but one conclusion. That was that the
thing upon the outside wished to come in and either it did
not have brains enough to know that there was a doorway, or
else it was too cunning to risk detection by attempting to pass
the sentries.</p>

<p>But why should any animal wish to enter the hut? Tarzan
lay upon his back, gazing up through the darkness in the
direction of the roof above him as he tried to find an answer
to his question. Presently, directly above his head, he saw a
little ray of moonlight. Whatever it was upon the roof had
made an opening that grew larger and larger as the creature
quietly tore away the thatching. The aperture was being
made close to the wall where the radiating rafters were farthest
apart, but whether this was through intent or accident
Tarzan could not guess. As the hole grew larger and he
caught occasional glimpses of the thing silhouetted against
the moonlit sky, a broad smile illuminated the face of the
ape-man. Now he saw strong little fingers working at the
twigs that were fastened laterally across the rafters to support
the thatch and presently, after several of these had been removed,
the opening was entirely closed by a furry little body
which wriggled through and dropped to the floor close beside
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"How did you find me, Nkima?" whispered Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Nkima followed," replied the little monkey. "All day he
has been sitting in a high tree above the village watching this
place and waiting for darkness. Why do you stay here, Tarzan
of the Apes? Why do you not come away with little
Nkima?"</p>

<p>"I am fastened here with a chain," said Tarzan. "I cannot
come away."</p>

<p>"Nkima will go and bring Muviro and his warriors," said
Nkima.</p>

<p>Of course he did not use these words at all, but what he
said in the language of the apes conveyed the same meaning
to Tarzan. Black apes carrying sharp, long sticks was the
expression that he used to describe the Waziri warriors, and
the name for Muviro was one of his own coining, but he and
Tarzan understood one another.</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan. "If I am going to need Muviro, he
could not get here in time now to be of any help to me. Go
back into the forest, Nkima, and wait for me. Perhaps I shall
join you very soon."</p>

<p>Nkima scolded, for he did not want to go away. He was
afraid alone in this strange forest; in fact, Nkima's life had
been one long complex of terror, relieved only by those
occasions when he could snuggle in the lap of his master,
safe within the solid walls of Tarzan's bungalow. One of the
sentries heard the voices within the hut and crawled part
way in.</p>

<p>"There," said Tarzan to Nkima, "you see what you have
done. Now you had better do as Tarzan tells you and get
out of here and into the forest before they catch you and eat
you."</p>

<p>"Who are you talking to?" demanded the sentry. He heard
a scampering in the darkness and at the same instant caught
sight of the hole in the roof and almost simultaneously he
saw something dark go through it and disappear. "What was
that?" he demanded nervously.</p>

<p>"That," said Tarzan, "was the ghost of your grandfather.
He came to tell me that you and your wives and all your
children would fall sick and die if anything happens to me.
He also brought the same message for Nyuto."</p>

<p>The sentry trembled. "Call him back," he begged, "and tell
him that I had nothing to do with it. It is not I, but Nyuto,
the chief, who is going to kill you."</p>

<p>"I cannot call him back," said Tarzan, "and so you had
better tell Nyuto not to kill me."</p>

<p>"I cannot see Nyuto until morning," wailed the black,
"perhaps then it will be too late."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan. "The ghost of your grandfather will
not do anything until tomorrow."</p>

<p>Terrified, the sentry returned to his post where Tarzan
heard him fearfully and excitedly discussing the matter with
his companion until the ape-man finally dropped off to sleep
again.</p>

<p>It was late the following morning before anyone entered
the hut in which Tarzan was confined. Then came Lukedi
with another gourd of milk. He was very much excited.</p>

<p>"Is what Ogonyo says true?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Who is Ogonyo?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He was one of the warriors who stood guard here last
night, and he has told Nyuto and all the village that he
heard the ghost of his grandfather talking with you and that
the ghost said that he would kill everyone in the village if
you were harmed, and now everyone is afraid."</p>

<p>"And Nyuto?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Nyuto is not afraid of anything," said Lukedi.</p>

<p>"Not even of ghosts of grandfathers?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No. He alone of all the Bagegos is not afraid of the men
of The Lost Tribe, and now he is very angry at you because
you have frightened his people and this evening you are to
be burned. Look!" And Lukedi pointed to the low doorway
of the hut. "From here you can see them placing the stake to
which you are to be bound, and the boys are in the forest
gathering faggots."</p>

<p>Tarzan pointed toward the hole in the roof. "There," he
said, "is the hole made by the ghost of Ogonyo's grandfather.
Fetch Nyuto and let him see. Then, perhaps, he will
believe."</p>

<p>"It will make no difference," said Lukedi. "If he saw a
thousand ghosts with his own eyes, he would not be afraid.
He is very brave, but he is also very stubborn and a fool.
Now we shall all die."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Can you not save me?" asked Lukedi.</p>

<p>"If you will help me to escape, I promise you that the
ghosts shall not harm you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could but do it," said Lukedi, as he passed the
gourd of milk to the ape-man.</p>

<p>"You bring me nothing but milk," said Tarzan. "Why is
that?"</p>

<p>"In this village we belong to the Buliso clan and, therefore,
we may not drink the milk nor eat the flesh of Timba,
the black cow, so when we have guests or prisoners we save
this food for them."</p>

<p>Tarzan was glad that the totem of the Buliso clan was a
cow instead of a grasshopper, or rainwater from the roofs
of houses or one of the hundreds of other objects that are
venerated by different clans, for while Tarzan's early training
had not placed grasshoppers beyond the pale as food for
men, he much preferred the milk of Timba.</p>

<p>"I wish that Nyuto would see me and talk with me," said
Tarzan of the Apes. "Then he would know that it would be
better to have me for a friend than for an enemy. Many men
have tried to kill me, many chiefs greater than Nyuto. This is
not the first hut in which I have lain a prisoner, nor is it the
first time that black men have prepared fires to receive me,
yet I still live, Lukedi, and many of them are dead. Go, therefore,
to Nyuto and advise him to treat me as a friend, for I
am not from The Lost Tribe of the Wiramwazi."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Lukedi, "and I shall go and beg
Nyuto to hear me, but I am afraid that he will not."</p>

<p>As the youth reached the doorway of the hut, there suddenly
arose a great commotion in the village. Tarzan heard
men issuing orders. He heard children crying and the pounding
of many naked feet upon the hard ground. Then the war-drums
boomed and he heard clashing of weapons upon
shields and loud shouting. He saw the guards before the doorway
spring to their feet and run to join the other warriors
and then Lukedi, at the doorway, shrank back with a cry of
terror.</p>

<p>"They come! They come!" he cried, and ran to the far
side of the hut where he crouched in terror.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Erich von Harben</span> looked into the faces of the tall, almost
naked, black warriors whose weapons menaced him across
the gunwale of their low dugout, and the first thing to attract
his attention was the nature of those weapons.</p>

<p>Their spears were unlike any that he had ever seen in the
hands of modern savages. Corresponding with the ordinary
spear of the African savage, they carried a heavy and formidable
javelin that suggested to the mind of the young
archaeologist nothing other than the ancient Roman pike, and
this similarity was further confirmed by the appearance of
the short, broad, two-edged swords that dangled in scabbards
supported by straps passing over the left shoulders of the
warriors. If this weapon was not the <span class="it">gladius Hispanus</span> of the
Imperial Legionary, von Harben felt that his studies and researches
had been for naught.</p>

<p>"Ask them what they want, Gabula," he directed. "Perhaps
they will understand you."</p>

<p>"Who are you and what do you want of us?" demanded
Gabula in the Bantu dialect of his tribe.</p>

<p>"We wish to be friends," added von Harben in the same
dialect. "We have come to visit your country. Take us to
your chief."</p>

<p>A tall black in the stern of the dugout shook his head. "I
do not understand you," he said. "You are our prisoners. We
are going to take you with us to our masters. Come, get into
the boat. If you resist or make trouble we shall kill you."</p>

<p>"They speak a strange language," said Gabula. "I do not
understand them."</p>

<p>Surprise and incredulity were reflected in the expression on
von Harben's face, and he experienced such a sensation as
one might who looked upon a man suddenly resurrected after
having been dead for nearly two thousand years.</p>

<p>Von Harben had been a close student of ancient Rome and
its long dead language, but how different was the living
tongue, which he heard and which he recognized for what it
was, from the dead and musty pages of ancient manuscripts.</p>

<p>He understood enough of what the black had said to get
his meaning, but he recognized the tongue as a hybrid of
Latin and Bantu root words, though the inflections appeared
to be uniformly those of the Latin language.</p>

<p>In his student days von Harben had often imagined himself
a citizen of Rome. He had delivered orations in the Forum
and had addressed his troops in the field in Africa and in
Gaul, but how different it all seemed now when he was faced
with the actuality rather than the figment of imagination. His
voice sounded strange in his own ears and his words came
haltingly as he spoke to the tall black in the language of the
Caesars.</p>

<p>"We are not enemies," he said. "We have come as friends
to visit your country," and then he waited, scarcely believing
that the man could understand him.</p>

<p>"Are you a citizen of Rome?" demanded the black.</p>

<p>"No, but my country is at peace with Rome," replied von
Harben.</p>

<p>The black looked puzzled as though he did not understand
the reply. "You are from Castra Sanguinarius." His words
carried the suggestion of a challenge.</p>

<p>"I am from Germania," replied von Harben.</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a country. You are a citizen of
Rome from Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"Take me to your chief," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"That is what I intend to do. Get in here. Our masters will
know what to do with you."</p>

<p>Von Harben and Gabula climbed into the dugout, so
awkwardly that they almost overturned it, much to the disgust
of the black warriors, who seized hold of them none too
gently and forced them to squat in the bottom of the frail
craft. This was now turned about and paddled along a winding
canal, bordered on either side by tufted papyrus rising
ten to fifteen feet above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"To what tribe do you belong?" asked von Harben, addressing
the leader of the blacks.</p>

<p>"We are barbarians of the Mare Orientis, subjects of
Validus Augustus, Emperor of the East; but why do you
ask such questions? You know these things as well as I."</p>

<p>A half hour of steady paddling along winding water-lanes
brought them to a collection of beehive huts built upon the
floating roots of the papyrus, from which the tall plants had
been cleared just sufficiently to make room for the half dozen
huts that constituted the village. Here von Harben and
Gabula became the centre of a curious and excited company
of men, women and children, and von Harben heard himself
and Gabula described by their captors as spies from Castra
Sanguinarius and learned that on the morrow they were to
be taken to Castrum Mare, which he decided must be the
village of the mysterious "masters" to whom his captors were
continually alluding. The blacks did not treat them unkindly,
though they evidently considered them as enemies.</p>

<p>When they were interviewed by the headman of the village,
von Harben, his curiosity aroused, asked the blacks why they
had not been molested if all of his people believed, as they
seemed to, that they were enemies.</p>

<p>"You are a citizen of Rome," replied the headman, "and
this other is your slave. Our masters do not permit us barbarians
to injure a citizen of Rome even though he may be
from Castra Sanguinarius, except in self-defence or upon the
battlefield in time of war."</p>

<p>"Who are your masters?" demanded von Harben.</p>

<p>"Why, the citizens of Rome who live in Castrum Mare, of
course, as one from Castra Sanguinarius well knows."</p>

<p>"But I am not from Castra Sanguinarius," insisted von
Harben.</p>

<p>"You may tell that to the officers of Validus Augustus,"
replied the headman. "Perhaps they will believe you, but it
is certain that I do not."</p>

<p>"Are these people who dwell in Castrum Mare black men?"
asked von Harben.</p>

<p>"Take them away," ordered the headman, "and confine
them safely in a hut. There they may ask one another foolish
questions. I do not care to listen to them further."</p>

<p>Von Harben and Gabula were led away by a group of
warriors and conducted into one of the small huts of the
village. Here they were brought a supper of fish and snails
and a dish concocted of the cooked pith of papyrus.</p>

<p>When morning dawned the prisoners were again served
with food similar to that which had been given them the
previous evening and shortly thereafter they were ordered
from the hut.</p>

<p>Upon the water-lane before the village floated half a dozen
dugouts filled with warriors. Their faces and bodies were
painted as for war and they appeared to have donned all their
finery of barbaric necklaces, anklets, bracelets, armbands, and
feathers that each could command: even the prows of the
canoes bore odd designs in fresh colours.</p>

<p>There were many more warriors than could have been
accommodated in the few huts within the small clearing, but,
as von Harben learned later, these came from other clearings,
several of which comprised the village. Von Harben and
Gabula were ordered into the chief's canoe and a moment
later the little fleet pushed off into the water-lane. Strong
paddlers propelled the dugouts along the winding waterway
in a north-easterly direction.</p>

<p>During the first hour they passed several small clearings in
each of which stood a few huts from which the women and
children came to the water's edge to watch them as they
passed, but for the most part the water-lane ran between
monotonous walls of lofty papyrus, broken only occasionally
by short stretches of more open water.</p>

<p>Von Harben tried to draw the chief into conversation,
especially relative to their destination and the nature of the
"masters" into whose hands they were to be delivered, but
the taciturn warrior ignored his every advance and finally
von Harben lapsed into the silence of resignation.</p>

<p>They had been paddling for hours, and the heat and
monotony had become almost unbearable, when a turn in the
water-lane revealed a small body of open water, across the
opposite side of which stretched what appeared to be low
land surmounted by an earthen rampart, along the top of
which was a strong stockade. The course of the canoe was
directed toward two lofty towers that apparently marked the
gateway through the rampart.</p>

<p>Figures of men could be seen loitering about this gateway,
and as they caught sight of the canoes a trumpet sounded
and a score of men sallied from the gateway and came down
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>As the boat drew nearer, von Harben saw that these men
were soldiers, and at the command of one of them the canoes
drew up a hundred yards offshore and waited there while the
chief shouted to the soldiers on shore telling them who he
was and the nature of his business. Permission was then given
for the chief's canoe to approach, but the others were ordered
to remain where they were.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," commanded one of the soldiers,
evidently an under-officer, as the dugout touched the shore.
"I have sent for the centurion."</p>

<p>Von Harben looked with amazement upon the soldiers
drawn up at the landing. They wore the tunics and cloaks of
Caesar's legionaries. Upon their feet were the sandal-like
caligae. A helmet, a leather cuirass, an ancient shield with
pike and Spanish sword completed the picture of antiquity;
only their skin belied the suggestion of their origin. They
were not white men; neither were they negroes, but for the
most part of a light brown colour with regular features.</p>

<p>They seemed only mildly curious concerning von Harben,
and on the whole appeared rather bored than otherwise. The
under-officer questioned the chief concerning conditions in
the village. They were casual questions on subjects of no
particular moment, but they indicated to von Harben a seemingly
interested and friendly relationship between the blacks
of the outlying villages in the papyrus swamp and the
evidently civilized brown people of the mainland; yet the fact
that only one canoe had been permitted to approach the land
suggested that other and less pleasant relations had also existed
between them at times. Beyond the rampart von Harben
could see the roofs of buildings and far away, beyond these,
the towering cliffs that formed the opposite side of the
canyon.</p>

<p>Presently two more soldiers emerged from the gateway
opposite the landing. One of them was evidently the officer
for whom they were waiting, his cloak and cuirass being of
finer materials and more elaborately decorated; while the
other, who walked a few paces behind him, was a common
soldier&mdash;probably the messenger who had been dispatched to
fetch him.</p>

<p>And now another surprise was added to those which von
Harben had already experienced since he had dropped over
the edge of the barrier cliffs into this little valley of anachronisms&mdash;the
officer was unquestionably white.</p>

<p>"Who are these, Rufinus?" he demanded of the under-officer.</p>

<p>"A barbarian chief and warriors from the villages of the
western shore," replied Rufinus. "They bring two prisoners
that they captured in the Rupes Flumen. As a reward they
wish permission to enter the city and see the Emperor."</p>

<p>"How many are they?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Sixty," replied Rufinus.</p>

<p>"They may enter the city," said the officer. "I will give
them a pass, but they must leave their weapons in their canoes
and be out of the city before dark. Send two men with them.
As to their seeing Validus Augustus, that I cannot arrange.
They might go to the palace and ask the praefect there. Have
the prisoners come ashore."</p>

<p>As von Harben and Gabula stepped from the dugout, the
expression upon the officer's face was one of perplexity.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My name is Erich von Harben," replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>The officer jerked his head impatiently. "There is no such
family in Castra Sanguinarius," he retorted.</p>

<p>"I am not from Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"Not from Castra Sanguinarius!" The officer laughed.</p>

<p>"That is the story he told me," said the black chief, who
had been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>"I suppose that he will be saying next that he is not a
citizen of Rome," said the officer.</p>

<p>"That is just what he does say," said the chief.</p>

<p>"But wait," exclaimed the officer, excitedly. "Perhaps you
are indeed from Rome herself!"</p>

<p>"No, I am not from Rome," von Harben assured him.</p>

<p>"Can it be that there are white barbarians in Africa!" exclaimed
the officer. "Surely your garments are not Roman.
Yes, you must be a barbarian unless, as I suspect, you are not
telling me the truth and you are indeed from Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"A spy, perhaps," suggested Rufinus.</p>

<p>"No," said von Harben. "I am no spy nor am I an enemy,"
and with a smile, "I am a barbarian, but a friendly barbarian."</p>

<p>"And who is this man?" asked the officer, indicating
Gabula. "Your slave?"</p>

<p>"He is my servant, but not a slave."</p>

<p>"Come with me," directed the officer. "I should like to talk
with you. I find you interesting, though I do not believe you."</p>

<p>Von Harben smiled. "I do not blame you," he said, "for
even though I see you before me I can scarcely believe that
you exist."</p>

<p>"I do not understand what you mean," said the officer, "but
come with me to my quarters."</p>

<p>He gave orders that Gabula was to be confined in the
guard-house temporarily, and then he led von Harben back to
one of the towers that guarded the entrance to the rampart.</p>

<p>The gate lay in a vertical plane at right angles to the rampart
with a high tower at either side, the rampart curving
inward at this point to connect with the tower at the inner
end of the gate. This made a curved entrance that forced an
enemy attempting to enter to disclose its right or unprotected
side to the defenders upon the rampart, a form of camp fortification
that von Harben knew had been peculiar to the
ancient Romans.</p>

<p>The officer's quarters consisted of a single, small, bare room
directly off a larger room occupied by the members of the
guard. It contained a desk, a bench, and a couple of roughly
made chairs.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the officer, after they had entered, "and
tell me something about yourself. If you are not from Castra
Sanguinarius, from whence do you come? How did you get
into our country and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am from Germania," replied von Harben.</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed the officer. "They are wild and savage
barbarians. They do not speak the language of Rome at all:
not even as poorly as you."</p>

<p>"How recently have you come in contact with German
barbarians?" von Harben asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I? Never, of course, but our historians knew them
well."</p>

<p>"And how lately have they written of them?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sanguinarius himself mentions them in the story of
his life."</p>

<p>"Sanguinarius?" questioned von Harben. "I do not recall
ever having heard of him."</p>

<p>"Sanguinarius fought against the barbarians of Germania
in the 839th year of Rome."</p>

<p>"That was about eighteen hundred and thirty-seven years
ago," von Harben reminded the officer, "and I think you will
have to admit that there may have been much progress in
that time."</p>

<p>"And why?" demanded the other. "There have been no
changes in this country since the days of Sanguinarius and he
has been dead over eighteen hundred years. It is not likely
then that barbarians would change greatly if Roman citizens
have not. You say you are from Germania. Perhaps you were
taken to Rome as a captive and got your civilization there,
but your apparel is strange. It is not of Rome. It is not of
any place of which I have ever heard. Go on with your
story."</p>

<p>"My father is a medical missionary in Africa," explained
von Harben. "Often when I have visited him I heard the story
of a lost tribe that was supposed to live in these mountains.
The natives told strange stories of a white race living in the
depths of the Wiramwazi. They said that the mountains were
inhabited by the ghosts of their dead. Briefly, I came to investigate
the story. All but one of my men, terrified after we
reached the outer slopes of the mountains, deserted me. That
one and I managed to descend to the floor of the canyon. Immediately
we were captured and brought here."</p>

<p>For a while the other sat in silence, thinking.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are telling me the truth," he said, at last.
"Your apparel is not that of Castra Sanguinarius and you
speak our language with such a peculiar accent and with so
great effort that it is evidently not your mother tongue. I shall
have to report your capture to the Emperor, but in the meantime
I shall take you to the home of my uncle, Septimus
Favonius. If he believes your story he can help you, as he
has great influence with the Emperor, Validus Augustus."</p>

<p>"You are kind," said von Harben, "and I shall need a
friend here if the customs of Imperial Rome still prevail in
your country as you suggest. Now that you know so much
about me, perhaps you will tell me something about yourself."</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," said the officer. "My name is Mallius
Lepus. I am a centurion in the army of Validus Augustus.
Perhaps, if you are familiar with Roman customs, you will
wonder that a patrician should be a centurion, but in this
matter as in some others we have not followed the customs of
Rome. Sanguinarius admitted all his centurions to the patrician
class, and since then for over eighteen hundred years
only patricians have been appointed centurions.</p>

<p>"But here is Aspar," exclaimed Mallius Lepus, as another
officer entered the room. "He has come to relieve me and
when he has taken over the gate you and I shall go at once
to the home of my uncle, Septimus Favonius."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Tarzan of the Apes</span> looked at Lukedi in surprise and then
out through the low doorway of the hut in an effort to see
what it was that had so filled the breast of the black youth
with terror.</p>

<p>The little section of the village street, framed by the doorway,
showed a milling mass of brown bodies, waving spears,
terrified women and children. What could it mean?</p>

<p>At first he thought that Lukedi meant that the Bagegos
were coming for Tarzan, but now he guessed that the Bagegos
were being beset by troubles of their own, and at last he came
to the conclusion that some other savage tribe had attacked
the village.</p>

<p>But, whatever the cause of the uproar, it was soon over.
He saw the Bagegos turn and flee in all directions. Strange
figures passed before his eyes in pursuit, and for a time there
was comparative silence, only a hurrying of feet, an occasional
command and now and then a scream of terror.</p>

<p>Presently three figures burst into the hut&mdash;enemy warriors
searching the village for fugitives. Lukedi, trembling, inarticulate,
paralysed by fright, crouched against the far wall.
Tarzan sat leaning against the centre pole to which he was
chained. At sight of him, the leading warrior halted, surprise
written upon his face. His fellows joined him and they stood
for a moment in excited conversation, evidently discussing
their find. Then one of them addressed Tarzan, but in a
tongue that the ape-man could not understand, although he
realized that there was something vaguely and tantalizingly
familiar about it.</p>

<p>Then one of them discovered Lukedi and, crossing the hut,
dragged him to the centre of the floor. They spoke again to
Tarzan, motioning him toward the door so that he understood
that they were ordering him from the hut, but in reply
he pointed to the chain about his neck.</p>

<p>One of the warriors examined the lock that secured the
chain, spoke to his fellows, and then left the hut. He returned
very shortly with two rocks and making Tarzan lie upon the
ground, placed the padlock upon one of the rocks and pounded
upon it with the other until it broke.</p>

<p>As soon as he was released, Tarzan and Lukedi were
ordered from the hut, and when they had come out into the
open the ape-man had an opportunity to examine his captors
more closely. In the centre of the village there were about
one hundred light-brown warriors surrounding their Bagego
prisoners, of whom there were some fifty men, women and
children.</p>

<p>The tunics, cuirasses, helmets, and sandals of the raiders
Tarzan knew that he had never seen before, and yet they
were as vaguely familiar as was the language spoken by their
wearers.</p>

<p>The heavy spears and the swords hanging at their right
sides were not precisely like any spears or swords that he had
ever seen, and yet he had a feeling that they were not entirely
unfamiliar objects. The effect of the appearance of these
strangers was tantalizing in the extreme. It is not uncommon
for us to have experiences that are immediately followed by
such a sensation of familiarity that we could swear we had
lived through them before in their minutest detail, and yet
we are unable to recall the time or place or any coincident
occurrences.</p>

<p>It was such a sensation that Tarzan experienced now. He
thought that he had seen these men before, that he had heard
them talk; he almost felt that at some time he had understood
their language, and yet at the same time he knew that
he had never seen them. Then a figure approached from the
opposite side of the village&mdash;a white man, garbed similarly to
the warriors, but in more resplendent trappings, and all of a
sudden Tarzan of the Apes found the key and the solution of
the mystery, for the man who came toward him might have
stepped from the pedestal of the statue of Julius Caesar in
the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome.</p>

<p>These were Romans! A thousand years after the fall of
Rome he had been captured by a band of Caesar's legionaries,
and now he knew why the language was so vaguely
familiar, for Tarzan, in his effort to fit himself for a place in
the civilized world into which necessity sometimes commanded
him, had studied many things and among them Latin, but
the reading of Caesar's Commentaries and scanning Virgil do
not give one a command of the language and so Tarzan could
neither speak nor understand the spoken words, though the
smattering that he had of the language was sufficient to make
it sound familiar when he heard others speaking it.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked intently at the Caesar-like white man approaching
him and at the dusky, stalwart legionaries about
him. He shook himself. This indeed must be a dream, and
then he saw Lukedi with the other Bagego prisoners. He saw
the stake that had been set up for his burning and he knew
that as these were realities so were the strange warriors about
him.</p>

<p>Each soldier carried a short length of chain, at one end of
which was a metal collar and a padlock, and with these they
were rapidly chaining the prisoners neck to neck.</p>

<p>While they were thus occupied the white man, who was
evidently an officer, was joined by two other whites similarly
garbed. The three caught sight of Tarzan and immediately
approached and questioned him, but the ape-man shook his
head to indicate that he could not understand their language.
Then they questioned the soldiers who had discovered him in
the hut and finally the commander of the company issued
some instructions relative to the ape-man and turned away.</p>

<p>The result was that Tarzan was not chained to the file of
black prisoners, but though he again wore the iron collar, the
end of the chain was held by one of the legionaries in whose
keeping he had evidently been placed.</p>

<p>Tarzan could only believe that this preferential treatment
was accorded him because of his colour and the reluctance
of the white officers to chain another white with negroes.</p>

<p>As the raiders marched away from the village one of the
officers and a dozen legionaries marched in advance. These
were followed by the long line of prisoners accompanied by
another officer and a small guard. Behind the prisoners, many
of whom were compelled to carry the live chickens that were
a part of the spoils of the raid, came another contingent of
soldiers herding the cows and goats and sheep of the villagers,
and behind all a large rear-guard comprising the greater part
of the legionaries under the command of the third officer.</p>

<p>The march led along the base of the mountains in a northerly
direction and presently upward diagonally across the
rising slopes at the west end of the Wiramwazi range.</p>

<p>It chanced that Tarzan's position was at the rear of the line
of black prisoners, at the end of which marched Lukedi.</p>

<p>"Who are these people, Lukedi?" asked Tarzan, after the
party had settled down to steady progress.</p>

<p>"These are the ghost people of the Wiramwazi," replied the
young Bagego.</p>

<p>"They have come to prevent the killing of their fellow,"
said another black, looking at Tarzan. "I knew Nyuto should
not have made him prisoner. I knew that harm would come
from it. It is well for us that the ghost people came before
we had slain him."</p>

<p>"What difference will it make?" said another. "I would
rather have been killed in my own village than to be taken
into the country of the ghost people and killed there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will not kill us," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They will not kill you because you are one of them, but
they will kill the Bagegos because they did dare to take you
prisoner."</p>

<p>"But they have taken him prisoner, too," said Lukedi. "Can
you not see that he is not one of them? He does not even
understand their language."</p>

<p>The other blacks shook their heads, but they were not convinced.
They had made up their minds that Tarzan was one
of the ghost people and they were determined that nothing
should alter this conviction.</p>

<p>After two hours of marching the trail turned sharply to the
right and entered a narrow and rocky gorge, the entrance to
which was so choked with trees and undergrowth that it
could not have been visible from any point upon the slopes
below.</p>

<p>The gorge soon narrowed until its rocky walls could be
spanned by a man's outstretched arms. The floor, strewn with
jagged bits of granite from the lofty cliffs above, afforded
poor and dangerous footing, so that the speed of the column
was greatly reduced.</p>

<p>As they proceeded Tarzan realized that, although they were
entering more deeply into the mountains, the trend of the
gorge was downward rather than upward. The cliffs on either
side rose higher and higher above them until in places the
gloom of night surrounded them and, far above, the stars
twinkled in the morning sky.</p>

<p>For a long hour they followed the windings of the dismal
gorge. The column halted for a minute or two and immediately
after the march was resumed Tarzan saw those directly
ahead of him filing through an arched gateway in the man-made
wall of solid masonry that entirely blocked the gorge
to a height of at least a hundred feet. Also, when it was the
ape-man's turn to pass the portal, he saw that it was guarded
by other soldiers similar to those into whose hands he had
fallen and that it was further reinforced by a great gate of
huge, hand-hewn timbers that had been swung open to permit
the party to pass.</p>

<p>Ahead of him Tarzan saw a well-worn road leading down
into a dense forest in which huge, live oaks predominated,
though interspersed with other varieties of trees, among which
he recognized acacias and a variety of plane tree as well as a
few cedars.</p>

<p>Shortly after passing through the gate the officer in charge
gave the command to halt at a small village of conical huts
that was inhabited by blacks not unlike the Bagegos, but
armed with pikes and swords similar to those carried by the
legionaries.</p>

<p>Preparations were immediately made to camp in the village,
the blacks turning over their huts to the soldiers, quite
evidently, judging from the expressions on their faces, with
poor grace. The legionaries took possession of whatever they
wished and ordered their hosts about with all the authority
and assurance of conquerors.</p>

<p>At this village a ration of corn and dried fish were issued to
the prisoners. They were given no shelter, but were permitted
to gather dead wood and build a fire, around which they
clustered, still chained neck to neck.</p>

<p>Numerous birds, strange to Tarzan, flitted among the
branches of the trees overhead and numerous monkeys chattered
and scolded, but monkeys were no novelty to Tarzan
of the Apes, who was far more interested in noting the
manners and customs of his captors.</p>

<p>Presently an acorn fell upon Tarzan's head, but as acorns
might be expected to fall from oak trees he paid no attention
to the occurrence until a second and third acorn in rapid
succession struck him squarely from above, and then he
glanced up to see a little monkey perched upon a low branch
just above him.</p>

<p>"So-o Nkima!" he exclaimed. "How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I saw them take you from the village of the Gomangani.
I followed."</p>

<p>"You came through the gorge, Nkima?"</p>

<p>"Nkima was afraid that the rocks would come together
and crush him," said the little monkey, "so he climbed to the
top and came over the mountains along the edge. Far, far
below he could hear the Tarmangani and the Gomangani
walking along the bottom. Away up there the wind blew and
little Nkima was cold and the spoor of Sheeta the panther
was everywhere and there were great baboons who chased
little Nkima, so that he was glad when he came to the end of
the mountain and saw the forest far below. It was a very
steep mountain. Even little Nkima was afraid, but he found
the way to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Nkima had better run home," said Tarzan. "This forest is
full of strange monkeys."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," said Nkima. "They are little monkeys
and they are afraid of Nkima. They are homely little monkeys.
They are not so beautiful as Nkima, but Nkima has seen
some of the shes looking at him and admiring him. It is not a
bad place for Nkima. What are the strange Tarmangani going
to do with Tarzan of the Apes?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Nkima," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Then Nkima will go back and fetch Muviro and the
Waziri."</p>

<p>"No," said the ape-man. "Wait until I find the Tarmangani
for whom we are searching. Then you may go back with a
message for Muviro."</p>

<p>That night Tarzan and the other prisoners slept upon the
hard ground in the open and, after it was dark, little Nkima
came down and snuggled in his master's arms and there he
lay all night, happy to be near the great Tarmangani he loved.</p>

<p>As morning dawned, Ogonyo, who had been captured with
the other Bagegos, opened his eyes and looked about him.
The camp of the soldiers was just stirring. Ogonyo saw some
of the legionaries emerging from the huts that they had commandeered.
He saw his fellow prisoners huddled close
together for warmth and at a little distance from them lay
the white man whom he had so recently guarded in the prison
hut in the village of Nyuto, his chief. As his eyes rested upon
the white man, he saw the head of a little monkey arise from
the encircling arms of the sleeper. He saw it cast a glance in
the direction of the legionaries emerging from the huts and
then saw it scamper quickly to a nearby tree and swing quickly
into the branches above.</p>

<p>Ogonyo gave a cry of alarm that awakened the prisoners
near him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Ogonyo?" cried one of them.</p>

<p>"The ghost of my grandfather!" he exclaimed. "I saw him
again. He came out of the mouth of the white man who calls
himself Tarzan. He has put a curse upon us because we kept
the white man prisoner. Now we are prisoners ourselves and
soon we shall be killed and eaten." The others nodded their
heads solemnly in confirmation.</p>

<p>Food similar to that given to them the night before was
given to the prisoners, and after they and the legionaries had
eaten, the march was resumed in a southerly direction along
the dusty road.</p>

<p>Until noon they plodded through the dust toward the south,
passing through other villages similar to that at which they
had camped during the night, and then they turned directly
east into a road that joined the main road at this point. Shortly
afterward Tarzan saw before him, stretching across the
road to the right and left as far as he could see through the
forest, a lofty rampart surmounted by palisades and battlements.
Directly ahead the roadway swung to the left just inside
the outer line of the rampart and passed through a gateway
that was flanked by lofty towers. At the base of the
rampart was a wide moat through which a stream of water
moved slowly, the moat being spanned by a bridge where the
road crossed it.</p>

<p>There was a brief halt at the gateway while the officer commanding
the company conferred with the commander of the
gate and then the legionaries and their prisoners filed through
and Tarzan saw stretching before him not a village of native
huts, but a city of substantial buildings.</p>

<p>Those near the gate were one-storey stucco houses, apparently
built around an inner courtyard, as he could see the
foliage of trees rising high above the roofs, but at a distance
down the vista of a long avenue he saw the outlines of more
imposing edifices rising to a greater height.</p>

<p>As they proceeded along the avenue they saw many people
upon the streets and in the doorways of the houses&mdash;brown
and black people, clothed for the most part in tunics and
cloaks, though many of the blacks were almost naked. In the
vicinity of the gateway there were a few shops, but as they
proceeded along the avenue these gave way to dwellings that
continued for a considerable distance until they reached a
section that seemed to be devoted to shops of a better grade
and to public buildings. Here they began to encounter white
men, though the proportion of them to the total population
seemed quite small.</p>

<p>The people they passed stopped to look at the legionaries
and their prisoners and at intersections little crowds formed
and quite a number followed them, but these were mostly
small boys.</p>

<p>The ape-man could see that he was attracting a great deal
of attention and the people seemed to be commenting and
speculating upon him. Some of them called to the legionaries,
who answered them good-naturedly, and there was considerable
joking and chaffing&mdash;probably, Tarzan surmised, at the
expense of the unfortunate prisoners.</p>

<p>During the brief passage through the city Tarzan came to
the conclusion that the black inhabitants were the servants,
perhaps slaves; the brown men, the soldiers and shopkeepers,
while the whites formed the aristocratic or patrician class.</p>

<p>Well within the city the company turned to the left into
another broad avenue and shortly afterward approached a
great circular edifice constructed of hewn granite blocks.
Arched apertures flanked by graceful columns rose tier upon
tier to a height of forty to fifty feet, and above the first storey
all of these arches were open. Through them Tarzan could
see that the enclosure was without a roof and he guessed that
this lofty wall enclosed an arena, since it bore a marked resemblance
to the Colosseum at Rome.</p>

<p>As they came opposite the building the head of the column
turned and entered it beneath a low, wide arch and here they
were led through numerous corridors in the first storey of the
building and down a flight of granite steps into gloomy, subterranean
chambers, where, opening from a long corridor, the
ends of which were lost in darkness in both directions, were
a series of narrow doorways before which swung heavy iron
gates. In parties of four or five the prisoners were unchained
and ordered into the dungeons that lay behind.</p>

<p>Tarzan found himself with Lukedi and two other Bagegos
in a small room constructed entirely of granite blocks. The
only openings were the narrow, grated doorway, through
which they entered, and a small, grated window in the top of
the wall opposite the door, and through this window came a
little light and air. The grating was closed upon them, the
heavy padlock snapped, and they were left alone to wonder
what fate lay in store for them.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Mallius Lepus</span> conducted von Harben from the quarters of
the captain of the gate in the south wall of the island city of
Castrum Mare and, summoning a soldier, bade him fetch
Gabula.</p>

<p>"You shall come with me as my guest, Erich von Harben,"
announced Mallius Lepus, "and, by Jupiter, unless I am mistaken,
Septimus Favonius will thank me for bringing such a
find. His dinners lag for want of novelty, for long since has
he exhausted all the possibilities of Castrum Mare. He has
even had a black chief from the Western forest as his guest
of honour, and once he invited the aristocracy of Castrum
Mare to meet a great ape.</p>

<p>"His friends will be mad to meet a barbarian chief from
Germania&mdash;you are a chief, are you not?" and as von Harben
was about to reply, Mallius Lepus stayed him with a gesture.
"Never mind! You shall be introduced as a chief and if I do
not know any different I cannot be accused of falsifying."</p>

<p>Von Harben smiled as he realized how alike was human
nature the world over and in all periods of time.</p>

<p>"Here is your slave now," said Mallius. "As the guest of
Septimus Favonius you will have others to do your bidding,
but doubtless you will want to have your own body-servant
as well."</p>

<p>"Yes," said von Harben. "Gabula has been very faithful. I
should hate to part with him."</p>

<p>Mallius led the way to a long shed-like building beneath
the inner face of the rampart. Here were two litters and a
number of strapping black bearers. As Mallius appeared eight
of these sprang to their stations in front and behind one of
the litters and carried it from the shed, lowering it to the
ground again before their master.</p>

<p>"And tell me, if you have visited Rome recently, does my
litter compare favourably with those now used by the
nobles?" demanded Mallius.</p>

<p>"There have been many changes, Mallius Lepus, since the
Rome of which your historian, Sanguinarius, wrote. Were I
to tell you of even the least of them, I fear that you would
not believe me."</p>

<p>"But certainly there could have been no great change in
the style of litters," argued Mallius, "and I cannot believe
that the patricians have ceased to use them."</p>

<p>"Their litters travel upon wheels now," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"Incredible!" exclaimed Mallius. "It would be torture to
bump over the rough pavements and country roads on the
great wooden wheels of ox-carts. No, Erich von Harben, I
am afraid I cannot believe that story."</p>

<p>"The city pavements are smooth today and the countryside
is cut in all directions by wide, level highways over which the
litters of the modern citizens of Rome roll at great speed on
small wheels with soft tyres&mdash;nothing like the great wooden
wheels of the ox-carts you have in mind, Mallius Lepus."</p>

<p>The officer called a command to his carriers, who broke
into a smart run.</p>

<p>"I warrant you, Erich von Harben, that there be no litters
in all Rome that move at greater speed than this," he boasted.</p>

<p>"How fast are we travelling now?" asked von Harben.</p>

<p>"Better than eighty-five hundred paces an hour," replied
Mallius.</p>

<p>"Fifty-thousand paces an hour is nothing unusual for the
wheeled litters of today," said von Harben. "We call them
automobiles."</p>

<p>"You are going to be a great success," cried Mallius, slapping
von Harben upon the shoulder. "May Jupiter strike me
dead if the guests of Septimus Favonius do not say that I
have made a find indeed. Tell them that there be litter-carriers
in Rome today who can run fifty thousand paces in an hour
and they will acclaim you the greatest entertainer as well as
the greatest liar Castrum Mare has ever seen."</p>

<p>Von Harben laughed good-naturedly. "But you will have
to admit, my friend, that I never said that there were litter-bearers
who could run fifty thousand paces an hour," he reminded
Mallius.</p>

<p>"But did you not assure me that the litters travelled that
fast? How then may a litter travel unless it is carried by
bearers? Perhaps the litters of today are carried by horses.
Where are the horses that can run fifty thousand paces in an
hour?"</p>

<p>"The litters are neither carried nor drawn by horses or
men, Mallius," said von Harben.</p>

<p>The officer leaned back against the soft cushions of the
carriage, roaring with laughter. "They fly then, I presume,"
he jeered. "By Hercules, you must tell this all over again to
Septimus Favonius. I promise you that he will love you."</p>

<p>They were passing along a broad avenue bordered by old
trees. There was no pavement and the surface of the street
was deep with dust. The houses were built quite up to the
street line and where there was space between adjacent houses
a high wall closed the aperture, so that each side of the street
presented a solid front of masonry broken by arched gateways,
heavy doors and small unglazed windows, heavily
barred.</p>

<p>"These are residences?" asked von Harben, indicating the
buildings they were passing.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mallius.</p>

<p>"From the massive doors and heavily barred windows I
should judge that your city is overrun with criminals," commented
von Harben.</p>

<p>Mallius shook his head. "On the contrary," he said, "we
have few criminals in Castrum Mare. The defences that you
see are against the possible uprising of slaves or invasions by
barbarians. Upon several occasions during the life of the city
such things have occurred, and so we build to safeguard
against disaster in the event that there should be a recurrence
of them, but, even so, doors are seldom locked, even at night,
for there are no thieves to break in, no criminals to menace
the lives of our people. If a man had done wrong to a fellow
man he may have reason to expect the dagger of the assassin,
but if his conscience be clear he may live without fear of
attack."</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive of a city without criminals," said von
Harben. "How do you account for it?"</p>

<p>"That is simple," replied Mallius. "When Honus Hasta revolted
and founded the city of Castrum Mare in the 953rd
year of Rome, Castra Sanguinarius was overrun with criminals,
so that no man dared go abroad at night without an
armed body-guard, nor was anyone safe within his own home,
and Honus Hasta, who became the first Emperor of the East,
swore that there should be no criminals in Castrum Mare
and he made laws so drastic that no thief or murderer lived
to propagate his kind. Indeed, the laws of Honus Hasta
destroyed not only the criminal, but all the members of his
family, so that there was none to transmit to posterity the
criminal inclinations of a depraved sire.</p>

<p>"There are many who thought Honus Hasta a cruel tyrant,
but time has shown the wisdom of many of his acts and certainly
our freedom from criminals may only be ascribed to
the fact that the laws of Honus Hasta prevented the breeding
of criminals. So seldom now does an individual arise who
steals or wantonly murders that it is an event of as great
moment as any that can occur, and the entire city takes a
holiday to see the culprit and his family destroyed."</p>

<p>Entering an avenue of more pretentious homes, the litter-bearers
halted before an ornate gate where Lepus and Erich
descended from the litter. In answer to the summons of the
former, the gate was opened by a slave and von Harben followed
his new friend across a tiled forecourt into an inner
garden, where beneath the shade of a tree a stout, elderly man
was writing at a low desk. It was with something of a thrill
that von Harben noted the ancient Roman inkstand, the reed
pen, and the roll of parchment that the man was using as
naturally as though they had not been quite extinct for a
thousand years.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Uncle!" cried Lepus, and as the older man
turned toward them, "I have brought you a guest such as no
citizen of Castrum Mare has entertained since the founding
of the city. This, my uncle, is Erich von Harben, barbarian
chief from far Germania." Then to von Harben, "My revered
uncle, Septimus Favonius."</p>

<p>Septimus Favonius arose and greeted von Harben hospitably,
yet with such a measure of conscious dignity as to carry
the suggestion that a barbarian, even though a chief and a
guest, could not be received upon a plane of actual social
equality by a citizen of Rome.</p>

<p>Very briefly Lepus recounted the occurrences leading to his
meeting with von Harben. Septimus Favonius seconded his
nephew's invitation to be their guest, and then, at the suggestion
of the older man, Lepus took Erich to his apartments
to outfit him with fresh apparel.</p>

<p>An hour later, Erich, shaved and apparelled as a young
Roman patrician, stepped from the apartment, which had
been placed at his disposal, into the adjoining chamber, which
was a part of the suite of Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"Go on down to the garden," said Lepus, "and when I am
dressed I shall join you there."</p>

<p>As von Harben passed through the home of Septimus
Favonius on his way to the garden court, he was impressed
by the peculiar blending of various cultures in the architecture
and decoration of the home.</p>

<p>The walls and columns of the building followed the simplest
Grecian lines of architecture, while the rugs, hangings and
mural decorations showed marked evidence of both oriental
and savage African influences. The latter he could understand
but the source of the oriental designs in many of the decorations
was quite beyond him, since it was obvious that The
Lost Tribe had had no intercourse with the outside world,
other than with the savage Bagegos, for many centuries.</p>

<p>And when he stepped out into the garden, which was of
considerable extent, he saw a further blending of Rome and
savage Africa, for while the main part of the building was
roofed with hand-made tile, several porches were covered with
native grass thatch, while a small out-building at the far end
of the garden was a replica of a Bagego hut except that the
walls were left unplastered, so that the structure appeared in
the nature of a summerhouse. Septimus Favonius had left the
garden and von Harben took advantage of the fact to examine
his surroundings more closely. The garden was laid out with
winding, gravelled walks, bordered by shrubs and flowers,
with an occasional tree, some of which gave evidence of great
age.</p>

<p>The young man's mind, his eyes, his imagination were so
fully occupied with his surroundings that he experienced a
sensation almost akin to shock as he followed the turning of
the path around a large ornamental shrub and came face to
face with a young woman.</p>

<p>That she was equally surprised was evidenced by the consternation
apparent in her expression as she looked wide-eyed
into the eyes of von Harben. For quite an appreciable moment
of time they stood looking at one another. Von Harben
thought that never in his life had he seen so beautiful a girl.
What the girl thought, von Harben did not know. It was she
who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, in a voice little above a whisper,
as one might conceivably address an apparition that had arisen
suddenly and unexpectedly before him.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger here," replied von Harben, "and I owe you
an apology for intruding upon your privacy. I thought that I
was alone in the garden."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" repeated the girl. "I have never seen your
face before or one like yours."</p>

<p>"And I," said von Harben, "have never seen a girl like you.
Perhaps I am dreaming. Perhaps you do not exist at all, for it
does not seem credible that in the world of realities such a
one as you could exist."</p>

<p>The girl blushed. "You are not of Castrum Mare," she said.
"That I can see." Her tone was a trifle cold and slightly
haughty.</p>

<p>"I have offended you," said von Harben. "I ask your
pardon. I did not mean to be offensive, but coming upon you
so unexpectedly quite took my breath away."</p>

<p>"And your manners, too?" asked the girl, but now her eyes
were smiling.</p>

<p>"You have forgiven me?" asked von Harben.</p>

<p>"You will have to tell me who you are and why you are
here before I can answer that," she replied. "For all I know
you might be an enemy or a barbarian."</p>

<p>Von Harben laughed. "Mallius Lepus, who invited me here,
insists that I am a barbarian," he said, "but even so I am
the guest of Septimus Favonius, his uncle."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged. "I am not surprised," she said. "My
father is notorious for the guests he honours."</p>

<p>"You are the daughter of Favonius?" asked von Harben.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Favonia," replied the girl, "but you have not
yet told me about yourself. I command you to do so," she
said, imperiously.</p>

<p>"I am Erich von Harben of Germania," said the young
man.</p>

<p>"Germania!" exclaimed the girl. "Caesar wrote of
Germania, as did Sanguinarius. It seems very far away."</p>

<p>"It never seemed so far as now," said von Harben; "yet
the three thousand miles of distance seem nothing by comparison
with the centuries of time that intervene."</p>

<p>The girl puckered her brows. "I do not understand you,"
she said.</p>

<p>"No," said von Harben, "and I cannot blame you."</p>

<p>"You are a chief, of course?" she asked.</p>

<p>He did not deny the insinuation, for he had been quick to
see from the attitude of the three patricians he had met that
the social standing of a barbarian in Castrum Mare might be
easily open to question, unless his barbarism was somewhat
mitigated by a title. Proud as he was of his nationality, von
Harben realized that it was a far cry from the European barbarians
of Caesar's day to their cultured descendants of the
twentieth century and that it would probably be impossible to
convince these people of the changes that have taken place
since their history was written; and, also, he was conscious of
a very definite desire to appear well in the eyes of this lovely
maiden of a bygone age.</p>

<p>"Favonia!" exclaimed von Harben. He scarcely breathed
the name.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him questioningly. "Yes!" she said.</p>

<p>"It is such a lovely name," he said "I never heard it spoken
before."</p>

<p>"You like it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed."</p>

<p>The girl puckered her brows in thought. She had beautiful
pencilled brows and a forehead that denoted an intelligence
that was belied by neither her eyes, her manner, nor her
speech. "I am glad that you like my name, but I do not
understand why I should be glad. You say that you are a
barbarian, and yet you do not seem like a barbarian. Your
appearance and your manner are those of a patrician, though
perhaps you are overbold with a young woman you have
never met before, but that I ascribe to the ignorance of the
barbarian and so I forgive it."</p>

<p>"Being a barbarian has its compensations," laughed von
Harben, "and perhaps, as I am a barbarian, I may be again
forgiven if I say you are quite the most beautiful girl I have
ever seen and the only one&mdash;I&mdash;could&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"You could what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Even a barbarian should not dare to say what I was about
to say to one whom I have known scarce half a dozen
minutes."</p>

<p>"Whoever you may be, you show rare discrimination,"
came a sarcastic tone in a man's voice behind von Harben.</p>

<p>The girl looked up in surprise and von Harben wheeled
about simultaneously, for neither had been aware of the
presence of another. Facing him von Harben saw a short,
dark, greasy-looking young man in an elaborate tunic, his
hand resting upon the hilt of the short sword that hung at
his hip. There was a sarcastic sneer upon the face of the
newcomer.</p>

<p>"Who is your barbarian friend, Favonia?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"This is Erich von Harben, a guest in the home of Septimus
Favonius, my father," replied the girl, haughtily; and to von
Harben, "This is Fulvus Fupus, who accepts the hospitality
of Septimus Favonius so often that he feels free to criticize
another guest."</p>

<p>Fupus flushed. "I apologize," he said, "but one may never
know when to honour or when to ridicule one of Septimus
Favonius's guests of honour. The last, if I recall correctly,
was an ape, and before that there was a black barbarian from
some outer village&mdash;but they are always interesting and I am
sure that the barbarian, Erich von Harben, will prove no exception
to the rule." The man's tone was sarcastic and
obnoxious to a degree, and it was with difficulty that von
Harben restrained his mounting temper.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at this moment, Mallius Lepus joined them
and von Harben was formally presented to Favonia. Fulvus
Fupus thereafter paid little attention to von Harben, but
devoted his time assiduously to Favonia. Von Harben knew
from their conversation that they were upon friendly and
intimate terms and he guessed that Fupus was in love with
Favonia, though he could not tell from the girl's attitude
whether or not she returned his affection.</p>

<p>There was something else that von Harben was sure of&mdash;that
he too was in love with Favonia. Upon several occasions
in life he had thought that he was in love, but his sensations
and reactions upon those other occasions had not been the
same in either kind or degree as those which he now experienced.
He found himself hating Fulvus Fupus, whom he had
known scarce a quarter of an hour and whose greatest
offence, aside from looking lovingly at Favonia, had been a
certain arrogant sarcasm of speech and manner&mdash;certainly
not sufficient warrant for a sane man to wish to do murder,
and yet Erich von Harben fingered the butt of his Luger,
which he had insisted upon wearing in addition to the slim
dagger with which Mallius Lepus had armed him.</p>

<p>Later, when Septimus Favonius joined them, he suggested
that they all go to the baths and Mallius Lepus whispered to
von Harben that his uncle was already itching to exhibit his
new find.</p>

<p>"He will take us to the Baths of Caesar," said Lepus,
"which are patronized by the richest patricians only, so have
a few good stories ready, but save your best ones, like that
you told me about the modern Roman litters, for the dinner
that my uncle is sure to give tonight&mdash;for he will have the
best of Castrum Mare there, possibly even the Emperor
himself."</p>

<p>The Baths of Caesar were housed in an imposing building,
of which that portion facing on the avenue was given over
to what appeared to be exclusive shops. The main entrance
led to a large court where the warmth with which the party
was greeted by a number of patrons of the Baths already
congregated there attested to the popularity of Favonius, his
daughter, and his nephew, while it was evident to von Harben
that there was less enthusiasm manifested for Fulvus
Fupus.</p>

<p>Servants conducted the bathers to the dressing-rooms, the
men's and women's being in different quarters of the building.</p>

<p>After his clothes were removed, von Harben's body was
anointed with oils in a warm room and then he was led into
a hot room and from there with the other men he passed into
a large apartment containing a plunge where both the men
and women gathered. About the plunge were seats for several
hundred people, and in the Baths of Caesar these were constructed
of highly polished granite.</p>

<p>While von Harben enjoyed the prospect of a swim in the
clear, cold water of the frigidarium, he was much more interested
by the opportunity it afforded him to be with
Favonia again. She was swimming slowly around the pool
when he entered the room and, making a long, running dive,
von Harben slipped easily and gracefully into the water, a
few strokes bringing him to her side. A murmur of applause
that followed meant nothing to von Harben, for he did not
know that diving was an unknown art among the citizens of
Castrum Mare.</p>

<p>Fulvus Fupus, who had entered the frigidarium behind von
Harben, sneered as he saw the dive and heard the applause.
He had never seen it done before, but he could see that the
thing was very easy, and realizing the advantages of so
graceful an accomplishment, he determined at once to show
the assembled patricians, and especially Favonia, that he was
equally a master of this athletic art as was the barbarian.</p>

<p>Running, as he had seen von Harben run, toward the edge
of the pool, Fulvus Fupus sprang high into the air and came
straight down upon his belly with a resounding smack that
sent the wind out of him and the water splashing high in all
directions.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, he managed to reach the side of the
pool, where he clung while the laughter of the assembled
patricians brought the scarlet of mortification to his face.
Whereas before he had viewed von Harben with contempt
and some slight suspicion he now viewed him with contempt,
suspicion, and hatred. Disgruntled, Fupus clambered from the
pool and returned immediately to the dressing-room, where
he donned his garments.</p>

<p>"Going already, Fupus?" demanded a young patrician who
was disrobing in the apodyterium.</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Fupus.</p>

<p>"I hear you came with Septimus Favonius and his new find.
What sort may he be?"</p>

<p>"Listen well, Caecilius Metellus," said Fupus. "This man
who calls himself Erich von Harben says that he is a chief
from Germania, but I believe otherwise."</p>

<p>"What do you believe?" demanded Metellus, politely,
though evidently with no considerable interest.</p>

<p>Fupus came close to the other. "I believe him to be a spy
from Castra Sanguinarius," he whispered, "and that he is
only pretending that he is a barbarian."</p>

<p>"But they say that he does not speak our language well,"
said Metellus.</p>

<p>"He speaks it as any man might speak it who wanted to
pretend that he did not understand it or that it was new to
him," said Fupus.</p>

<p>Metellus shook his head. "Septimus Favonius is no fool,"
he said, "I doubt if there is anyone in Castra Sanguinarius
sufficiently clever to fool him to such an extent."</p>

<p>"There is only one man who has any right to judge as to
that," snapped Fupus, "and he is going to have the facts before
I am an hour older."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Metellus.</p>

<p>"Validus Augustus, Emperor of the East&mdash;I am going to
him at once."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Fupus," counselled Metellus. "You will
only get yourself laughed at or possibly worse. Know you not
that Septimus Favonius is high in the favour of the
Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but is it not also known that he was friendly
with Cassius Hasta, nephew of the Emperor, whom Validus
Augustus accused of treason and banished. It would not take
much to convince the Emperor that this Erich von Harben is
an emissary of Cassius Hasta, who is reputed to be in Castra
Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>Caecilius Metellus laughed. "Go on then and make a fool
of yourself, Fupus," he said. "You will probably fetch up at
the end of a rope."</p>

<p>"The end of a rope will terminate this business," agreed
Fupus, "but von Harben will be there, not I."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">As</span> night fell upon the city of Castra Sanguinarius, the
gloom of the granite dungeons beneath the city's Colosseum
deepened into blackest darkness, which was relieved only by
a rectangular patch of starlit sky where barred windows
pierced the walls.</p>

<p>Squatting upon the rough stone floor, his back against the
wall, Tarzan watched the stars moving in slow procession
across the window's opening. A creature of the wild, impatient
of restraint, the ape-man suffered the mental anguish
of the caged beast&mdash;perhaps, because of his human mind, his
suffering was greater than would have been that of one of
the lower orders, yet he endured with even greater outward
stoicism than the beast that paces to and fro seeking escape
from the bars that confine it.</p>

<p>As the feet of the beast might have measured the walls of
its dungeon, so did the mind of Tarzan, and never for a
waking moment was his mind not occupied by thoughts of
escape.</p>

<p>Lukedi and the other inmates of the dungeon slept, but
Tarzan still sat watching the free stars and envying them,
when he became conscious of a sound, ever so slight, coming
from the arena, the floor of which was about on a level with
the sill of the little window in the top of the dungeon wall.
Something was moving, stealthily and cautiously, upon the
sand of the arena. Presently, framed in the window, silhouetted
against the sky, appeared a familiar figure. Tarzan
smiled and whispered a word so low that a human ear could
scarce have heard it, and Nkima slipped between the bars
and dropped to the floor of the dungeon. An instant later the
little monkey snuggled close to Tarzan, its long, muscular
arms clasped tightly about the neck of the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Come with me," pleaded Nkima. "Why do you stay in
this cold, dark hole beneath the ground?"</p>

<p>"You have seen the cage in which we sometimes keep
Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nkima.</p>

<p>"Jad-bal-ja cannot get out unless we open the gate," explained
Tarzan. "I too am in a cage. I cannot get out until
they open the gate."</p>

<p>"I will go and get Muviro and his Gomangani with the
sharp sticks," said Nkima. "They will come and let you out."</p>

<p>"No, Nkima," said Tarzan. "If I cannot get out by myself,
Muviro could not get here in time to free me, and if he came
many of my brave Waziri would be killed, for there are fighting
men here in far greater numbers than Muviro could
bring." After a while Tarzan slept, and curled up within his
arms slept Nkima, the little monkey, but when Tarzan awoke
in the morning Nkima was gone.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the morning soldiers came and the
door of the dungeon was unlocked and opened to admit
several of them, including a young white officer, who was
accompanied by a black slave. The officer addressed Tarzan
in the language of the city, but the ape-man shook his head,
indicating that he did not understand; then the other turned
to the black slave with a few words and the latter spoke to
Tarzan in the Bagego dialect, asking him if he understood it.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the ape-man and through the interpreter the
officer questioned Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what were you, a white man, doing in
the village of the Bagegos?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," replied the prisoner. "I was
looking for another white man who is lost somewhere in
these mountains, but I slipped upon the cliffside and fell and
while I was unconscious the Bagegos took me prisoner, and
when your soldiers raided the Bagego village they found me
there. Now that you know about me, I presume that I shall
be released."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the officer. "Are you a citizen of
Rome?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Tarzan. "What has that to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"Because if you are not a citizen of Rome it is quite
possible that you are an enemy. How do we know that you
are not from Castrum Mare?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I do not know," he said, "how you
would know that since I do not even know what Castrum
Mare means."</p>

<p>"That is what you would say if you wished to deceive us,"
said the officer, "and you would also pretend that you could
not speak or understand our language, but you will find that
it is not going to be easy to deceive us. We are not such fools
as the people of Castrum Mare believe us to be."</p>

<p>"Where is this Castrum Mare and what is it?" asked
Tarzan.</p>

<p>The officer laughed. "You are very clever," he said.</p>

<p>"I assure you," said the ape-man, "that I am not trying to
deceive you. Believe me for a moment and answer one
question."</p>

<p>"What is it you wish to ask?"</p>

<p>"Has another white man come into your country within
the last few weeks? He is the one for whom I am searching."</p>

<p>"No white man has entered this country," replied the
officer, "since Marcus Crispus Sanguinarius led the Third
Cohort of the Tenth Legion in victorious conquest of the
barbarians who inhabited it eighteen hundred and twenty-three
years ago."</p>

<p>"And if a stranger were in your country you would know
it?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"If he were in Castra Sanguinarius yes," replied the
officer, "but if he had entered Castrum Mare at the east end
of the valley I should not know it; but come, I was not sent
here to answer questions, but to fetch you before one who
will ask them."</p>

<p>At a word from the officer, the soldiers who accompanied
him conducted Tarzan from the dungeon, along the corridor
through which he had come the previous day and up into the
city. The detachment proceeded for a mile through the city
streets to an imposing building, before the entrance to which
there was stationed a military guard whose elaborate cuirasses,
helmets, and crests suggested that they might be a part
of a select military organization.</p>

<p>The metal plates of their cuirasses appeared to Tarzan to
be of gold, as did the metal of their helmets, while the hilts
and scabbards of their swords were elaborately carved and
further ornamented with coloured stones ingeniously inlaid
in the metal, and to their gorgeous appearance was added the
final touch of scarlet cloaks.</p>

<p>The officer who met the party at the gate admitted Tarzan,
the black interpreter, and the officer who had brought him,
but the guard of soldiery was replaced by a detachment of
resplendent men-at-arms similar to those who guarded the
entrance to the palace.</p>

<p>Tarzan was taken immediately into the building and along
a wide corridor, from which opened many chambers, to a
large, oblong room flanked by stately columns. At the far
end of the apartment a large man sat in a huge, carved chair
upon a raised dais.</p>

<p>There were many other people in the room, nearly all of
whom were colourfully garbed in bright cloaks over coloured
tunics and ornate cuirasses of leather or metal, while others
wore only simple flowing togas, usually of white. Slaves,
messengers, officers were constantly entering or leaving the
chamber. The party accompanying Tarzan withdrew between
the columns at one side of the room and waited there.</p>

<p>"What is this place?" asked Tarzan of the Bagego interpreter,
"and who is the man at the far end of the room?"</p>

<p>"This is the throne-room of the Emperor of the West and
that is Sublatus Imperator himself."</p>

<p>For some time Tarzan watched the scene before him with
interest. He saw people, evidently of all classes, approach the
throne and address the Emperor, and though he could not
understand their words, he judged that they were addressing
pleas to their ruler. There were patricians among the suppliants,
brown-skinned shopkeepers, black barbarians resplendent
in their savage finery, and even slaves.</p>

<p>The Emperor, Sublatus, presented an imposing figure. Over
a tunic of white linen, the Emperor wore a cuirass of gold.
His sandals were of white with gold buckles, and from his
shoulders fell the purple robe of the Caesars. A fillet of embroidered
linen about his brow was the only other insignia
of his station.</p>

<p>Directly behind the throne were heavy hangings against
which were ranged a file of soldiers bearing poles surmounted
by silver eagles and various other devices, and banners, of
the meaning and purpose of which Tarzan was ignorant.
Upon every column along the side of the wall were hung
shields of various shapes over crossed banners and standards
similar to those ranged behind the Emperor. Everything pertaining
to the embellishment of the room was martial, the
mural decorations being crudely painted scenes of war.</p>

<p>Presently a man, who appeared to be an official of the
court, approached them and addressed the officer who had
brought Tarzan from the Colosseum.</p>

<p>"Are you Maximus Praeclarus?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Present yourself with the prisoner."</p>

<p>As Tarzan advanced toward the throne surrounded by the
detachment of the guard, all eyes were turned upon him, for
he was a conspicuous figure even in this assemblage of gorgeously
apparelled courtiers and soldiers, though his only
garments were a loin-cloth and a leopard skin. His suntanned
skin, his shock of black hair and his grey eyes might not
alone have marked him especially in such an assemblage, for
there were other dark-skinned, black-haired, grey-eyed men
among them, but there was only one who towered inches
above them all and he was Tarzan. The undulating smoothness
of his easy stride suggested even to the mind of the
proud and haughty Sublatus the fierce and savage power of
the king of beasts, which perhaps accounted for the fact that
the Emperor, with raised hand, halted the party a little farther
from the throne than usual.</p>

<p>As the party halted before the throne, Tarzan did not wait
to be questioned, but, turning to the Bagego interpreter, said:
"Ask Sublatus why I have been made a prisoner and tell him
that I demand that he free me at once."</p>

<p>The black quailed. "Do as I tell you," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What is he saying?" asked Sublatus of the interpreter.</p>

<p>"I fear to repeat such words to the Emperor," replied the
black.</p>

<p>"I command it," said Sublatus.</p>

<p>"He asked why he has been made a prisoner and demands
that he be released at once."</p>

<p>"Ask him who he is," said Sublatus, angrily, "that he dares
issue commands to Sublatus Imperator."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Tarzan, after the Emperor's words had
been translated to him, "that I am Tarzan of the Apes, but
if that means as little to him as his name means to me, I
have other means to convince him that I am as accustomed
to issuing orders and being obeyed as is he."</p>

<p>"Take the insolent dog away," replied Sublatus with
trembling voice after he had been told what Tarzan's words
had been.</p>

<p>The soldiers laid hold of Tarzan, but he shook them off.
"Tell him," snapped the ape-man, "that as one white man to
another I demand an answer to my question. Tell him that I
did not approach his country as an enemy, but as a friend,
and that I shall look to him to see that I am accorded the
treatment to which I am entitled, and that before I leave this
room."</p>

<p>When these words were translated to Sublatus, the purple
of his enraged face matched the imperial purple of his cloak.</p>

<p>"Take him away," he shrieked. "Take him away. Call the
guard. Throw Maximus Praeclarus into chains for permitting
a prisoner to thus address Sublatus."</p>

<p>Two soldiers seized Tarzan, one his right arm, the other
his left, but he swung them suddenly together before him
and with such force did their heads meet that they relaxed
their grasps upon him and sank unconscious to the floor, and
then it was that the ape-man leaped with the agility of a cat
to the dais where sat the Emperor Sublatus.</p>

<p>So quickly had the act been accompanied and so unexpected
was it that there was none prepared to come between
Tarzan and the Emperor in time to prevent the terrible indignity
that Tarzan proceeded to inflict upon him.</p>

<p>Seizing the Emperor by the shoulder, he lifted him from
his throne and wheeled him about and then grasping him by
the scruff of the neck and the bottom of his curiass, he lifted
him from the floor just as several pike-men leaped forward to
rescue Sublatus. But when they were about to menace Tarzan
with their pikes, he used the body of the screaming Sublatus
as a shield so that the soldiers dared not to attack for fear of
killing their Emperor.</p>

<p>"Tell them," said Tarzan to the Bagego interpreter, "that
if any man interferes with me before I have reached the
street, I shall wring the Emperor's neck. Tell him to order
them back. If he does, I shall set him free when he is out of
the building. If he refuses, it will be at his own risk."</p>

<p>When this message was given to Sublatus, he stopped
screaming orders to his people to attack the ape-man and
instead warned them to permit Tarzan to leave the palace.
Carrying the Emperor above his head, Tarzan leaped from
the dais and as he did so the courtiers fell back in accordance
with the commands of Sublatus, who now ordered them to
turn their backs that they might not witness the indignity that
was being done their ruler.</p>

<p>Down the long throne-room and through the corridors to
the outer court Tarzan of the Apes carried Sublatus Imperator
above his head and at the command of the ape-man
the black interpreter went ahead, but there was no need for
him, since Sublatus kept the road clear as he issued commands
in a voice that trembled with a combination of rage,
fear and mortification.</p>

<p>At the outer gate the members of the guard begged to be
permitted to rescue Sublatus and avenge the insult that had
been put upon him, but the Emperor warned them to permit
his captor to leave the palace in safety, provided he kept his
word and liberated Sublatus when they had reached the
avenue beyond the gate.</p>

<p>The scarlet-cloaked guard fell back grumbling, their eyes
filled with anger because of the humiliation of their Emperor.
Even though they had no love for him, yet he was the
personification of the power and dignity of their government,
and the scene that they witnessed filled them with mortification
as the half-naked barbarian bore their commander-in-chief
through the palace gates and out into the tree-bordered
avenue beyond, while the black interpreter marched ahead,
scarce knowing whether to be more downcast by terror or
elated through pride in this unwonted publicity.</p>

<p>The city of Castra Sanguinarius had been carved from the
primeval forest that clothed the west end of the canyon, and
with unusual vision the founders of the city had cleared only
such spaces as were necessary for avenues, buildings, and
similar purposes. Ancient trees overhung the avenue. Before
the palace and in many places their foliage overspread the
low housetops, mingling with the foliage of the trees in inner
courtyards.</p>

<p>Midway of the broad avenue the ape-man halted and lowered
Sublatus to the ground. He turned his eyes in the
direction of the gateway through which the soldiers of Sublatus
were crowding out into the avenue.</p>

<p>"Tell them," said Tarzan to the interpreter, "to go back
into the palace grounds; then, and then only, shall I release
their Emperor," for Tarzan had noted the ready javelins in
the hands of many of the guardsmen and guessed that the
moment his body ceased to be protected by the near presence
of Sublatus it would be the target and the goal of a score of
the weapons.</p>

<p>When the interpreter delivered the ape-man's ultimatum to
them, the guardsmen hesitated, but Sublatus commanded
them to obey, for the barbarian's heavy grip upon his
shoulder convinced him that there was no hope that he might
escape alive or uninjured unless he and his soldiers acceded
to the creature's demand. As the last of the guardsmen
passed back into the palace courtyard Tarzan released the
Emperor and as Sublatus hastened quickly toward the gate,
the guardsmen made a sudden sally into the avenue.</p>

<p>They saw their quarry turn and take a few quick steps,
leap high into the air and disappear amidst the foliage of an
overhanging oak. A dozen javelins hurtled among the
branches of the tree. The soldiers rushed forward, their eyes
strained upward, but the quarry had vanished.</p>

<p>Sublatus was close upon their heels. "Quick!" he cried.
"After him! A thousand denarii to the man who brings down
the barbarian."</p>

<p>"There he goes!" cried one, pointing.</p>

<p>"No," cried another. "I saw him there among the foliage.
I saw the branches move," and he pointed in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the ape-man moved swiftly through
the trees along one side of the avenue, dropped to a low roof,
crossed it and sprang into a tree that rose from an inner
court, pausing there to listen for signs of pursuit. After the
manner of a wild beast hunted through his native jungle, he
moved as silently as the shadow of a shadow, so that now,
although he crouched scarce twenty feet above them, the two
people in the courtyard below him were unaware of his
presence.</p>

<p>But Tarzan was not unaware of theirs and as he listened
to the noise of the growing pursuit, that was spreading now
in all directions through the city, he took note of the girl and
the man in the garden beneath him. It was apparent that the
man was wooing the maid, and Tarzan needed no knowledge
of their spoken language to interpret the gestures, the glances,
and the facial expressions of passionate pleading upon the
part of the man or the cold aloofness of the girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes a tilt of her head presented a partial view of
her profile to the ape-man and he guessed that she was very
beautiful, but the face of the young man with her reminded
him of the face of Pamba, the rat.</p>

<p>It was evident that his courtship was not progressing to
the liking of the youth and now there were evidences of anger
in his tone. The girl rose haughtily and with a cold word
turned away, and then the man leaped to his feet from the
bench upon which they had been sitting and seized her roughly
by the arm. She turned surprised and angry eyes upon him
and had half voiced a cry for help when the rat-faced man
clapped a hand across her mouth and with his free arm
dragged her into his embrace.</p>

<p>Now all this was none of Tarzan's affair. The shes of the
city of Castra Sanguinarius meant no more to the savage ape-man
than did the shes of the village of Nyuto, chief of the
Bagegos. They meant no more to him than did Sabor the
lioness and far less than did the shes of the tribe of Akut or
of Toyat the king apes&mdash;but Tarzan of the Apes was often a
creature of impulses; now he realized that he did not like
the rat-faced young man, and that he never could like him,
while the girl that he was maltreating seemed to be doubly
likeable because of her evident aversion to her tormentor.</p>

<p>The man had bent the girl's frail body back upon the
bench, his lips were close to hers, when there was a sudden
jarring of the ground beside him and he turned astonished
eyes upon the figure of a half-naked giant. Steel-grey eyes
looked into his beady black ones, a heavy hand fell upon the
collar of his tunic, and he felt himself lifted from the body
of the girl and then hurled roughly aside.</p>

<p>He saw his assailant lift his victim to her feet and his little
eyes saw, too, another thing; the stranger was unarmed!
Then it was that the sword of Fastus leaped from its scabbard
and that Tarzan of the Apes found himself facing naked
steel. The girl saw what Fastus would do. She saw that the
stranger who protected her was unarmed and she leaped between
them, at the same time calling loudly, "Axuch! Sarus!
Mpingu! Hither! Quickly!"</p>

<p>Tarzan seized the girl and swung her quickly behind him,
and simultaneously Fastus was upon him. But the Roman
had reckoned without his host and the easy conquest over an
unarmed man that he had expected seemed suddenly less easy
of accomplishment, for when his keen Spanish sword swung
down to cleave the body of his foe, that foe was not there.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Fastus witnessed such agility. It was
as though the eyes and body of the barbarian moved more
rapidly than the sword of Fastus, and always a fraction of an
inch ahead.</p>

<p>Three times Fastus swung viciously at the stranger, and
three times his blade cut empty air, while the girl, wide-eyed
with astonishment, watched the seemingly unequal duel. Her
heart filled with admiration for this strange young giant, who,
though he was evidently a barbarian, looked more the patrician
than Fastus himself. Three times the blade of Fastus
cut harmlessly through empty air&mdash;and then there was a
lightning-like movement on the part of his antagonist. A
brown hand shot beneath the guard of the Roman, steel
fingers gripped his wrist, and an instant later the sword clattered
to the tile walk of the courtyard. At the same moment
two white men and a negro hurried breathlessly into the
garden and ran quickly forward&mdash;two with daggers in their
hands and one, the black, with a sword.</p>

<p>They saw Tarzan standing between Fastus and the girl.
They saw the man in the grip of a stranger. They saw the
sword clatter to the ground, and naturally they reached the
one conclusion that seemed possible&mdash;Fastus was being
worsted in an attempt to protect the girl against a stranger.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw them coming toward him and realized that
three to one are heavy odds. He was upon the point of using
Fastus as a shield against his new enemies when the girl
stepped before the three and motioned them to stop. Again
the tantalizing tongue that he could almost understand and
yet not quite, as the girl explained the circumstances to the
newcomers while Tarzan still stood holding Fastus by the
wrist.</p>

<p>Presently the girl turned to Tarzan and addressed him, but
he only shook his head to indicate that he could not understand
her; then, as his eyes fell upon the black, a possible
means of communication with these people occurred to him,
for the negro resembled closely the Bagegos of the outer
world.</p>

<p>"Are you a Bagego?" asked Tarzan in the language of that
tribe.</p>

<p>The black looked surprised. "Yes," he said, "I am, but who
are you?"</p>

<p>"And you speak the language of these people?" asked Tarzan,
indicating the young woman and Fastus and ignoring the
black's query.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the black. "I have been a prisoner among
them for many years, but there are many Bagegos among my
fellow prisoners and we have not forgotten the language of
our mother."</p>

<p>"Good," said Tarzan. "Through you this young woman
may speak to me."</p>

<p>"She wants to know who you are, and where you came
from, and what you were doing in her garden, and how you
got here, and how you happened to protect her from Fastus,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tarzan held up his hand. "One at a time," he cried. "Tell
her I am Tarzan of the Apes, a stranger from a far country,
and I came here in friendship seeking one of my own people
who is lost."</p>

<p>Now came an interruption in the form of loud pounding
and hallooing beyond the outer doorway of the building.</p>

<p>"See what that may be, Axuch," directed the girl, and as
the one so addressed, and evidently a slave, humbly turned to
do her bidding, she once more addressed Tarzan through the
interpreter.</p>

<p>"You have won the gratitude of Dilecta," she said, "and
you shall be rewarded by her father."</p>

<p>At this moment Axuch returned followed by a young
officer. As the eyes of the newcomer fell upon Tarzan they
went wide and he started back, his hand going to the hilt of
his sword, and simultaneously Tarzan recognized him as
Maximus Praeclarus, the young patrician officer who had
conducted him from the Colosseum to the palace.</p>

<p>"Lay off your sword, Maximus Praeclarus," said the young
girl, "for this man is no enemy."</p>

<p>"And you are sure of that, Dilecta?" demanded Praeclarus.
"What do you know of him?"</p>

<p>"I know that he came in time to save me from this swine
who would have harmed me," said the girl haughtily, casting
a withering glance at Fastus.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Praeclarus. "This is a barbarian
prisoner of war who calls himself Tarzan and whom I took
this morning from the Colosseum to the palace at the command
of the Emperor, that Sublatus might look upon the
strange creature, whom some thought to be a spy from
Castrum Mare."</p>

<p>"If he is a prisoner, what is he doing here, then?" demanded
the girl. "And why are you here?"</p>

<p>"This fellow attacked the Emperor himself and then
escaped from the palace. The entire city is being searched
and I, being in charge of a detachment of soldiers assigned to
this district, came immediately hither, fearing the very thing
that had happened and that this wild man might find you and
do you harm."</p>

<p>"It was the patrician, Fastus, son of Imperial Caesar, who
would have harmed me," said the girl. "It was the wild man
who saved me from him."</p>

<p>Maximus Praeclarus looked quickly at Fastus, the son of
Sublatus, and then at Tarzan. The young officer appeared to
be resting upon the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<p>"There is your man," said Fastus, with a sneer. "Back to
the dungeons with him."</p>

<p>"Maximus Praeclarus does not take orders from Fastus,"
said the young man, "and he knows his duty without consulting
him."</p>

<p>"You will arrest this man who has protected me, Praeclarus?"
demanded Dilecta.</p>

<p>"What else may I do?" asked Praeclarus. "It is my duty."</p>

<p>"Then do it," sneered Fastus.</p>

<p>Praeclarus went white. "It is with difficulty that I can keep
my hands off you, Fastus," he said. "If you were the son of
Jupiter himself, it would not take much more to get yourself
choked. If you know what is well for you, you will go before
I lose control of my temper."</p>

<p>"Mpingu," said Dilecta, "show Fastus to the avenue."</p>

<p>Fastus flushed. "My father, the Emperor, shall hear of
this," he snarled; "and do not forget, Dilecta, your father
stands none too well in the estimation of Sublatus Imperator."</p>

<p>"Begone," cried Dilecta, "before I order my black slave to
throw you into the avenue."</p>

<p>With a sneer and a swagger Fastus quit the garden, and
when he had gone Dilecta turned to Maximus Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" she cried. "I must protect this noble
stranger who saved me from Fastus, and at the same time
you must do your duty and return him to Sublatus."</p>

<p>"I have a plan," said Maximus Praeclarus, "but I cannot
carry it out unless I can talk with the stranger."</p>

<p>"Mpingu can understand and interpret for him," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"Can you trust Mpingu implicitly?" asked Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said Dilecta.</p>

<p>"Then send away the others," said Praeclarus, indicating
Axuch and Sarus; and when Mpingu returned from escorting
Fastus to the street he found Maximus Praeclarus,
Dilecta, and Tarzan alone in the garden.</p>

<p>Praeclarus motioned Mpingu to advance. "Tell the stranger
that I have been sent to arrest him," he said to Mpingu, "but
tell him also that because of the service he has rendered
Dilecta I wish to protect him, if he will follow my
instructions."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Tarzan when the question had
been put to him. "What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"I wish you to come with me," said Praeclarus; "to come
with me as though you were my prisoner. I shall take you in
the direction of the Colosseum and when I am opposite my
own home I shall give you a signal so that you will understand
that the house is mine. Immediately afterward I will
make it possible for you to escape into the trees as you did
when you quit the palace with Sublatus. Go, then, immediately
to my house and remain there until I return. Dilecta will
send Mpingu there now to warn my servants that you are
coming. At my command they will protect you with their
lives. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," replied the ape-man, when the plan had
been explained to him by Mpingu.</p>

<p>"Later," said Praeclarus, "we may be able to find a way to
get you out of Castra Sanguinarius across the mountains."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">The</span> cares of state rested lightly upon the shoulders of
Validus Augustus, Emperor of the East, for though his title
was imposing his domain was small and his subjects few. The
island city of Castrum Mare boasted a population of only a
trifle more than twenty-two thousand people, of which some
three thousand were whites and nineteen thousand of mixed
blood, while outside the city, in the villages of the lake dwellers,
and along the eastern shore of Mare Orientis, dwelt the
balance of his subjects, comprising some twenty-six thousand
blacks.</p>

<p>Today, reports and audiences disposed of, the Emperor
had withdrawn to the palace garden to spend an hour in conversation
with a few of his intimates, while his musicians,
concealed within a vine-covered bower, entertained him.
While he was thus occupied a chamberlain approached and
announced that the patrician Fulvus Fupus begged an
audience of the Emperor.</p>

<p>"Fulvus knows that the audience hour is past," snapped the
Emperor. "Bid him come on the morrow."</p>

<p>"He insists, most glorious Caesar," said the chamberlain,
"that his business is of the utmost importance and that it is
only because he felt that the safety of the Emperor is at stake
that he came at this hour."</p>

<p>"Bring him here then," commanded Validus, and, as the
chamberlain turned away, "Am I never to have a moment's
relaxation without some fool like Fulvus Fupus breaking in
upon me with some silly story?" he grumbled to one of his
companions.</p>

<p>When Fulvus approached the Emperor a moment later, he
was received with a cold and haughty stare.</p>

<p>"I have come, most glorious Caesar," said Fulvus, "to fulfil
the duty of a citizen of Rome, whose first concern should be
the safety of his Emperor."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" snapped Validus. "Quick,
out with it!"</p>

<p>"There is a stranger in Castrum Mare who claims to be a
barbarian from Germania, but I believe him to be a spy from
Castrum Sanguinarius where, it is said, Cassius Hasta is an
honoured guest of Sublatus, in that city."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Cassius Hasta and what has he
to do with it?" demanded Validus.</p>

<p>"It is said&mdash;it is rumoured," stammered Fulvus Fupus,
"that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have heard too many rumours already about Cassius
Hasta," exclaimed Validus. "Can I not dispatch my nephew
upon a mission without every fool in Castrum Mare lying
awake nights to conjure motives, which may later be ascribed
to me."</p>

<p>"It is only what I heard," said Fulvus, flushed and uncomfortable.
"I do not know anything about it. I did not say that
I knew."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you hear?" demanded Validus. "Come,
out with it."</p>

<p>"The talk is common in the Baths that you sent Cassius
Hasta away because he was plotting treason and that he went
at once to Sublatus, who received him in a friendly fashion
and that together they are planning an attack upon Castrum
Mare."</p>

<p>Validus scowled. "Baseless rumour," he said; "but what
about this prisoner? What has he to do with it and why have
I not been advised of his presence?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know," said Fulvus Fupus. "That is why I
felt it doubly my duty to inform you, since the man who is
harbouring the stranger is a most powerful patrician and one
who might well be ambitious."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the Emperor.</p>

<p>"Septimus Favonius," replied Fupus.</p>

<p>"Septimus Favonius," exclaimed Validus. "Impossible."</p>

<p>"Not so impossible," said Fupus, boldly, "if glorious
Caesar will but recall the friendship that ever existed between
Cassius Hasta and Mallius Lepus, the nephew of Septimus
Favonius. The home of Septimus Favonius was the other
home of Cassius Hasta. To whom, then, sooner might he turn
for aid than to his powerful friend whose ambitions are well
known outside the palace, even though they may not as yet
have come to the ears of Validus Augustus?"</p>

<p>Nervously the Emperor arose and paced to and fro, the
eyes of the others watching him narrowly; those of Fulvus
Fupus narrowed with malign anticipation.</p>

<p>Presently Validus halted and turned toward one of his
courtiers. "May Hercules strike me dead," he cried, "if there
be not some truth in what Fulvus Fupus suggests!" and to
Fupus, "What is this stranger like?"</p>

<p>"He is a man of white skin, yet of slightly different complexion
and appearance than the usual patrician. He feigns to
speak our language with a certain practised stiltedness that is
intended to suggest lack of familiarity. This, I think, is merely
a part of the ruse to deceive."</p>

<p>"How did he come into Castrum Mare and none of my
officers report the matter to me?" asked Validus.</p>

<p>"That you may learn from Mallius Lepus," said Fulvus
Fupus, "for Mallius Lepus was in command of the Porta
Decumana when some of the barbarians of the lake villages
brought him there, presumably a prisoner, yet Caesar knows
how easy it would have been to bribe these creatures to play
such a part."</p>

<p>"You explain it so well, Fulvus Fupus," said the Emperor,
"that one might even suspect you to have been the instigator
of the plot, or at least to have given much thought to similar
schemes."</p>

<p>"Caesar's ever brilliant wit never deserts him," said Fupus,
forcing a smile, though his face paled.</p>

<p>"We shall see," snapped Validus, and turning to one of his
officers, "Order the arrest of Septimus Favonius, and Mallius
Lepus and this stranger at once."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking a chamberlain entered the garden
and approached the Emperor. "Septimus Favonius requests
an audience," he announced. "Mallius Lepus, his nephew, and
a stranger are with him."</p>

<p>"Fetch them," said Validus, and to the officer who was
about to depart to arrest them, "Wait here. We shall see what
Septimus Favonius has to say."</p>

<p>A moment later the three entered and approached the Emperor.
Favonius and Lepus saluted Validus and then the
former presented von Harben as a barbarian chief from
Germania.</p>

<p>"We have already heard of this barbarian chief," said
Validus, with a sneer. Favonius and Lepus glanced at Fupus.
"Why was I not immediately notified of the capture of this
prisoner?" This time the Emperor directed his remarks to
Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"There has been little delay, Caesar," replied the young
officer. "It was necessary that he be bathed and properly
clothed before he was brought here."</p>

<p>"It was necessary that he be brought here," said Validus.
"There are dungeons in Castrum Mare for prisoners from
Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"He is not from Castra Sanguinarius," said Septimus
Favonius.</p>

<p>"Where are you from and what are you doing in my
country?" demanded Validus, turning upon von Harben.</p>

<p>"I am from a country that your historians knew as Germania,"
replied Erich.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you learned to speak our language in Germania,"
sneered Validus.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied von Harben, "I did."</p>

<p>"And you have never been to Castra Sanguinarius?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"I presume you have been to Rome," laughed Validus.</p>

<p>"Yes, many times," replied von Harben.</p>

<p>"And who is Emperor there now?"</p>

<p>"There is no Roman Emperor," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"No Roman Emperor!" exclaimed Validus. "If you are not
a spy from Castra Sanguinarius, you are a lunatic. Perhaps
you are both, for no one but a lunatic would expect me to
believe such a story. No Roman Emperor, indeed!"</p>

<p>"There is no Roman Emperor," said von Harben, "because
there is no Roman Empire. Mallius Lepus tells me that your
country has had no intercourse with the outside world for
more than eighteen hundred years. Much can happen in that
time&mdash;much has happened. Rome fell, over a thousand years
ago. No nation speaks its language today, which is understood
by priests and scholars only. The barbarians of Germania, of
Gallia, and of Britannia have built empires and civilizations
of tremendous power, and Rome is only a city in Italia."</p>

<p>Mallius Lepus was beaming delightedly. "I told you," he
whispered to Favonius, "that you would love him. By Jupiter,
I wish he would tell Validus the story of the litters that travel
fifty thousand paces an hour!"</p>

<p>There was that in the tone and manner of von Harben that
compelled confidence and belief, so that even the suspicious
Validus gave credence to the seemingly wild tales of the
stranger and presently found himself asking questions of the
barbarian.</p>

<p>Finally the Emperor turned to Fulvus Fupus. "Upon what
proof did you accuse this man of being a spy from Castra
Sanguinarius?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Where else may he be from?" asked Fulvus Fupus. "We
know he is not from Castrum Mare, so he must be from
Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"You have no evidence then to substantiate your accusations?"</p>

<p>Fupus hesitated.</p>

<p>"Get out," ordered Validus, angrily, "I shall attend to you
later."</p>

<p>Overcome by mortification, Fupus left the garden, but the
malevolent glances that he shot at Favonius, Lepus and Erich
boded them no good. Validus looked long and searchingly at
von Harben for several minutes after Fupus had left the
garden as though attempting to read the soul of the stranger
standing before him.</p>

<p>"So there is no Emperor at Rome," he mused, half aloud.
"When Sanguinarius led his cohort out of Aegyptus, Nerva
was Emperor. That was upon the sixth day before the calends
of February in the 848th year of the city in the second year
of Nerva's reign. Since that day no word of Rome has reached
the descendants of Sanguinarius and his cohort."</p>

<p>Von Harben figured rapidly, searching his memory of the
historical dates and data of ancient history that were as fresh
in his mind as those of his own day. "The sixth day before
the calends of February," he repeated; "that would be the
twenty-seventh day of January in the 848th year of the city&mdash;why,
January twenty-seventh, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 98, is the date of Nerva's
death," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, if Sanguinarius had but known," said Validus, "but
Aegyptus is a long way from Rome and Sanguinarius was far
to the south up the Nilus before word could have reached his
post by ancient Thebae that his enemy was dead. And who
became Emperor after Nerva? Do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Trajan," replied von Harben.</p>

<p>"Why do you, a barbarian, know so much concerning the
history of Rome?" asked the Emperor.</p>

<p>"I am a student of such things," replied von Harben. "It
has been my ambition to become an authority on the subject."</p>

<p>"Could you write down these happenings since the death
of Nerva?"</p>

<p>"I could put down all that I could recall, or all that I have
read," said von Harben, "but it would take a long time."</p>

<p>"You shall do it," said Validus, "and you shall have the
time."</p>

<p>"But I have not planned remaining in your country," dissented
von Harben.</p>

<p>"You shall remain," said Validus. "You shall also write a
history of the reign of Validus Augustus, Emperor of the
East."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" interjected von Harben.</p>

<p>"Enough!" snapped Validus. "I am Caesar. It is a command."</p>

<p>Von Harben shrugged and smiled. Rome and the Caesars,
he realized, had never seemed other than musty parchment
and weather-worn inscriptions cut in crumbling stone, until
now.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was a real Caesar. What mattered it that his
empire was naught but a few square miles of marsh, an island
and swampy shore-land in the bottom of an unknown canyon,
or that his subjects numbered less than fifty thousand souls&mdash;the
first Augustus himself was no more a Caesar than was his
namesake, Validus.</p>

<p>"Come," said Validus, "I shall take you to the library myself,
for that will be the scene of your labours."</p>

<p>In the library, which was a vault-like room at the end of a
long corridor, Validus displayed with pride several hundred
parchment rolls neatly arranged upon shelves.</p>

<p>"Here," said Validus, selecting one of the rolls, "is the story
of Sanguinarius and the history of our country up to the
founding of Castrum Mare. Take it with you and read it at
your leisure, for while you shall remain with Septimus
Favonius, whom with Mallius Lepus I shall hold responsible
for you, every day you shall come to the palace and I shall
dictate to you the history of my reign. Go, now, with Septimus
Favonius and at this hour tomorrow attend again upon
Caesar."</p>

<p>When they were outside the palace of Validus Augustus,
von Harben turned to Mallius Lepus. "It is a question
whether I am prisoner or guest," he said, with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are both," said Mallius Lepus, "but that you
are even partially a guest is fortunate for you. Validus
Augustus is vain, arrogant, and cruel. He is also suspicious,
for he knows that he is not popular, and Fulvus Fupus had
evidently almost succeeded in bringing your doom upon you
and ruin to Favonius and myself before we arrived. What
strange whim altered the mind of Caesar I do not know, but
it is fortunate for you that it was altered; fortunate, too, for
Septimus Favonius and Mallius Lepus."</p>

<p>"But it will take years to write the history of Rome," said
von Harben.</p>

<p>"And if you refuse to write it you will be dead many more
years than it would take to accomplish the task," retorted
Mallius Lepus, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Castrum Mare is not an unpleasant place in which to
live," said Septimus Favonius.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said von Harben, as the face of
the daughter of Favonius presented itself to his mind.</p>

<p>Returned to the home of his host, the instinct of the
archaeologist and the scholar urged von Harben to an early
perusal of the ancient papyrus roll that Caesar had lent him,
so that no sooner was he in the apartments that had been set
aside for him than he stretched himself upon a long sofa and
untied the cords that confined the roll.</p>

<p>As it unrolled before his eyes he saw a manuscript in
ancient Latin, marred by changes and erasures, yellowed by
age. It was quite unlike anything that had previously fallen
into his hands during his scholarly investigations into the history
and literature of ancient Rome. For whereas such other
original ancient manuscripts as he had had the good fortune
to examine had been the work of clerks or scholars, a
moment's glance at this marked it as the laborious effort of a
soldier unskilled in literary pursuits.</p>

<p>The manuscript bristled with the rough idiom of far-flung
camps of veteran legionaries, with the slang of Rome and
Egypt of nearly two thousand years before, and there were
references to people and places that appeared in no histories
or geographies known to modern man&mdash;little places and little
people that were without fame in their own time and whose
very memory had long been erased from the consciousness of
man, but yet in this crude manuscript they lived again for
Erich von Harben&mdash;the quaestor who had saved the life of
Sanguinarius in an Egyptian town that never was on any
map, and there was Marcus Crispus Sanguinarius himself
who had been of sufficient importance to win the enmity of
Nerva in the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 90, while the latter was consul&mdash;Marcus
Crispus Sanguinarius, the founder of an empire, whose
name appears nowhere in the annals of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>With mounting interest von Harben read the complaints of
Sanguinarius and his anger because the enmity of Nerva had
caused him to be relegated to the hot sands of this distant
post below the ancient city of Thebae in far Aegyptus.</p>

<p>Writing in the third person, Sanguinarius had said:</p>

<p>"Sanguinarius, a praefect of the Third Cohort of the Tenth
Legion, stationed below Thebae in Aegyptus in the 846th year
of the city, immediately after Nerva assumed the purple, was
accused of having plotted against the Emperor.</p>

<p>"About the fifth day before the calends of February in the
848th year of the city a messenger came to Sanguinarius from
Nerva commanding the praefect to return to Rome and place
himself under arrest, but this Sanguinarius had no mind to
do, and as no other in his camp knew the nature of the message
he had received from Nerva, Sanguinarius struck the
messenger down with his dagger and caused the word to be
spread among his men that the man had been an assassin sent
from Rome and that Sanguinarius had slain him in self-defence.</p>

<p>"He also told his lieutenants and centurions that Nerva was
sending a large force to destroy the cohort and he prevailed
upon them to follow up the Nilus in search of a new country
where they might establish themselves far from the malignant
power of a jealous Caesar, and upon the following day the
long march commenced.</p>

<p>"It so happened that shortly before this a fleet of one
hundred and twenty vessels landed at Myos Hormos, a port of
Aegyptus on the Sinus Arabius. This merchant fleet annually
brought rich merchandise from the island of Taprobana&mdash;silk,
the value of which was equal to its weight in gold, pearls,
diamonds, and a variety of aromatics and other merchandise,
which was transferred to the backs of camels and brought
inland from Myos Hormos to the Nilus and down that river
to Alexandria, whence it was shipped to Rome.</p>

<p>"With this caravan were hundreds of slaves from India and
far Cathay and even light-skinned people captured in the distant
north-west by mongol raiders. The majority of these were
young girls destined for the auction block at Rome. And it so
chanced that Sanguinarius met this caravan, heavy with riches
and women, and captured it. During the ensuing five years the
cohort settled several times in what they hoped would prove
a permanent camp, but it was not until the 853rd year of
Rome that, by accident, they discovered the hidden canyon
where now stands Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"You find it interesting?" inquired a voice from the doorway,
and looking up von Harben saw Mallius Lepus standing
on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Very," said Erich.</p>

<p>Lepus shrugged his shoulders. "We suspect that it would
have been more interesting had the old assassin written the
truth," said Lepus. "As a matter of fact, very little is known
concerning his reign, which lasted for twenty years. He was
assassinated in the year 20 Anno Sanguinarii, which corresponds
to the 873rd year of Rome. The old buck named the
city after himself, decreed a calendar of his own, and had his
head stamped on gold coins, many of which are still in existence.
Even today we use his calendar quite as much as that of
our Roman ancestors, but in Castrum Mare we have tried to
forget the example of Sanguinarius as much as possible."</p>

<p>"What is this other city that I have heard mentioned so
often and that is called Castra Sanguinarius?" asked von
Harben.</p>

<p>"It is the original city founded by Sanguinarius," replied
Lepus. "For a hundred years after the founding of the city
conditions grew more and more intolerable until no man's life
or property was safe, unless he was willing to reduce himself
to the status of a slave and continually fawn upon the Emperor.
It was then that Honus Hasta revolted and led a few
hundred families to this island at the eastern end of the valley,
founding the city and the empire of Castrum Mare. Here, for
over seventeen hundred years, the descendants of the families
have lived in comparative peace and security, but in an almost
constant state of war with Castra Sanguinarius.</p>

<p>"From mutual necessity the two cities carry on a commerce
that is often interrupted by raids and wars. The suspicion and
hatred that the inhabitants of each city feel for the inhabitants
of the other is fostered always by our Emperors, each of
whom fears that friendly communication between the two
cities would result in the overthrow of one of them."</p>

<p>"And now Castrum Mare is happy and contented under
Caesar?" asked Erich.</p>

<p>"That is a question that it might not be safe to answer
honestly," said Lepus, with a shrug.</p>

<p>"If I am going to the palace every day to write the history
of Rome for Validus Augustus and receive from him the story
of his reign," said von Harben, "it might be well if I knew
something of the man, otherwise there is a chance for me to
get into serious trouble, which might conceivably react upon
you and Septimus Favonius, whom Caesar has made responsible
for me. If you care to forewarn me, I promise you that
I shall repeat nothing that you may tell me."</p>

<p>Lepus, leaning lightly against the wall by the doorway,
played idly with the hilt of his dagger as he took thought before
replying. Presently he looked up, straight into von
Harben's eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall trust you," he said; "first, because there is that in
you which inspires confidence, and, second, because it cannot
profit you to harm either Septimus Favonius or myself. Castrum
Mare is not happy with its Caesar. He is arrogant and
cruel&mdash;not like the Caesars to which Castrum Mare has been
accustomed.</p>

<p>"The last Emperor was a kindly man, but at the time of
his death his brother, Validus Augustus, was chosen to succeed
him because Caesar's son was, at that time, but a year
old.</p>

<p>"This son of the former Emperor, a nephew of Validus
Augustus, is called Cassius Hasta. And because of his popularity
he has aroused the jealousy and hatred of Augustus,
who recently sent him away upon a dangerous mission to the
west end of the valley. There are many who consider it virtual
banishment, but Validus Augustus insists that this is not the
fact. No one knows what Cassius Hasta's orders were. He
went secretly by night and was accompanied by only a few
slaves.</p>

<p>"It is believed that he has been ordered to enter Castra
Sanguinarius as a spy, and if such is the case his mission
amounts practically to a sentence of death. If this were
known for a fact, the people would rise against Validus
Augustus, for Cassius Hasta was the most popular man in
Castrum Mare.</p>

<p>"But enough. I shall not bore you with the sorrows of
Castrum Mare. Take your reading down into the garden
where, in the shade of the trees, it is cooler than here and I
shall join you presently."</p>

<p>As von Harben lay stretched upon the sward beneath the
shade of a tree in the cool garden of Septimus Favonius, his
mind was not upon the history of Sanguinarius, nor upon
the political woes of Castrum Mare so much as they were
upon plans for escape.</p>

<p>As a scholar, an explorer, and an archaeologist he would
delight in remaining here for such a time as might be
necessary for him to make an exploration of the valley and
study the government and customs of its inhabitants, but to
remain cooped up in the vault-like library of the Emperor of
the East writing the history of ancient Rome in Latin with a
reed pen on papyrus rolls in no way appealed to him.</p>

<p>The rustle of fresh linen and the soft fall of sandalled feet
upon the gravelled garden walk interrupted his trend of
thought and as he looked up into the face of Favonia,
daughter of Septimus Favonius, the history of ancient Rome
together with half-formulated plans for escape were dissipated
from his mind by the girl's sweet smile, as is a morning
mist by the rising sun.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">As</span> Maximus Praeclarus led Tarzan of the Apes from the
home of Dion Splendidus in the city of Castra Sanguinarius,
the soldiers, gathered by the doorway, voiced their satisfaction
in oaths and exclamations. They liked the young patrician
who commanded them and they were proud that he should
have captured the wild barbarian single handed.</p>

<p>A command from Praeclarus brought silence and at a word
from him they formed around the prisoner, and the march
toward the Colosseum was begun. They had proceeded but a
short distance when Praeclarus halted the detachment and
went himself to the doorway of a house fronting on the
avenue through which they were crossing. He halted before
the door, stood in thought for a moment, and then turned
back toward his detachment as though he had changed his
mind about entering, and Tarzan knew that the young officer
was indicating to him the home in which he lived and in
which the ape-man might find sanctuary later.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards farther along the street, after they
had resumed the march, Praeclarus halted his detachment beneath
the shade of great trees opposite a drinking fountain,
which was built into the outside of a garden wall close beside
an unusually large tree, which, overspreading the avenue
upon one side and the wall on the other, intermingled its
branches with those of other trees growing inside the garden
beyond.</p>

<p>Praeclarus crossed the avenue and drank at the fountain
and returning inquired by means of signs if Tarzan would
drink. The ape-man nodded in assent and Praeclarus gave
orders that he be permitted to cross to the fountain.</p>

<p>Slowly Tarzan walked to the other side of the avenue. He
stooped and drank from the fountain. Beside him was the
bole of a great tree; above him was the leafy foliage that
would conceal him from the sight and protect him from the
missiles of the soldiers. Turning from the fountain, a quick
step took him behind the tree. One of the soldiers shouted a
warning to Praeclarus, and the whole detachment, immediately
suspicious, leaped quickly across the avenue, led by the
young patrician who commanded them, but when they reached
the fountain and the tree their prisoner had vanished.</p>

<p>Shouting their disappointment, they gazed upward into the
foliage, but there was no sign there of the barbarian. Several
of the more active soldiers scrambled into the branches and
then Maximus Praeclarus, pointing in the direction opposite
to that in which his home lay, shouted: "This way, there he
goes!" and started on a run down the avenue, while behind
him strung his detachment, their pikes ready in their hands.</p>

<p>Moving silently through the branches of the great trees that
overhung the greater part of the city of Castra Sanguinarius,
Tarzan paralleled the avenue leading back to the home of
Maximus Praeclarus, halting at last in a tree that overlooked
the inner courtyard or walled garden, which appeared to be a
distinguishing feature of the architecture of the city.</p>

<p>Below him he saw a matronly woman of the patrician class,
listening to a tall black who was addressing her excitedly.
Clustered about the woman and eagerly listening to the words
of the speaker were a number of black slaves, both men and
women.</p>

<p>Tarzan recognized the speaker as Mpingu, and, although
he could not understand his words, realized that the black was
preparing them for his arrival in accordance with the instructions
given him in the garden of Dion Splendidus by Maximus
Praeclarus, and that he was making a good story of it was
evidenced by his excited gesticulation and the wide eyes and
open mouths of the listening blacks.</p>

<p>The woman, listening attentively and with quiet dignity of
mien, appeared to be slightly amused, but whether at the story
itself or at the unrestrained excitement of Mpingu, Tarzan
did not know.</p>

<p>She was a regal-looking woman of about fifty, with greying
hair and with the poise and manner of that perfect self-assurance
which is the hallmark of assured position; that she
was a patrician to her finger-tips was evident, and yet there
was that in her eyes and the little wrinkles at their corners
that bespoke a broad humanity and a kindly disposition.</p>

<p>Mpingu had evidently reached the point where his vocabulary
could furnish no adequate superlatives wherewith to describe
the barbarian who had rescued his mistress from
Fastus, and he was acting out in exaggerated pantomime the
scene in the garden of his mistress, when Tarzan dropped
lightly to the sward beside him. The effect upon the blacks of
this unexpected appearance verged upon the ludicrous, but the
white woman was unmoved to any outward sign of surprise.</p>

<p>"Is this the barbarian?" she asked of Mpingu.</p>

<p>"It is he," replied the black.</p>

<p>"Tell him that I am Festivitas, the mother of Maximus
Praeclarus," the woman directed Mpingu, "and that I welcome
him here in the name of my son."</p>

<p>Through Mpingu, Tarzan acknowledged the greeting of
Festivitas and thanked her for her hospitality, after which she
instructed one of her slaves to conduct the stranger to the
apartments that were placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon before Maximus Praeclarus returned
to his home, going immediately to Tarzan's apartments. With
him was the same black who had acted as interpreter in the
morning.</p>

<p>"I am to remain here with you," said the black to Tarzan,
"as your interpreter and servant."</p>

<p>"I venture to say," said Praeclarus through the interpreter,
"that this is the only spot in Castra Sanguinarius that they
have not searched for you and there are three centuries combing
the forests outside the city, though by this time Sublatus
is convinced that you have escaped. We shall keep you here
in hiding for a few days when, I think, I can find the means
to get you out of the city after dark."</p>

<p>The ape-man smiled. "I can leave whenever I choose," he
said, "either by day or by night, but I do not choose to leave
until I have satisfied myself that the man for whom I am
searching is not here. But, first, let me thank you for your
kindness to me, the reason for which I cannot understand."</p>

<p>"That is easily explained," said Praeclarus. "The young
woman whom you saved from attack this morning is Dilecta,
the daughter of Dion Splendidus. She and I are to be married.
That I think will explain my gratitude."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Tarzan, "and I am glad that I was
fortunate enough to come upon them at the time that I did."</p>

<p>"Should you be captured again, it will not prove so fortunate
for you," said Praeclarus, "for the man from whom you
saved Dilecta is Fastus, the son of Sublatus, and now the
Emperor will have two indignities to avenge; but if you remain
here you will be safe, for our slaves are loyal and there
is little likelihood that you will be discovered."</p>

<p>"If I remain here," said Tarzan, "and it should be discovered
that you had befriended me, would not the anger of
the Emperor fall upon you?"</p>

<p>Maximus Praeclarus shrugged. "I am daily expecting that,"
he said; "not because of you, but because the son of the
Emperor wishes to marry Dilecta. Sublatus needs no further
excuse to destroy me. I should be no worse off were he to
learn that I have befriended you than I now am."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps I may be of service to you if I remain,"
said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I do not see how you can do anything but remain," said
Praeclarus. "Every man, woman, and child in Castra Sanguinarius
will be on the lookout for you, for Sublatus has
offered a huge reward for your capture, and besides the
inhabitants of the city there are thousands of black barbarians
outside the walls who will lay aside every other
interest to run you down."</p>

<p>"Twice today you have seen how easily I can escape from
the soldiers of Sublatus," said Tarzan, smiling. "Just as easily
can I leave the city and elude the barbarians in the outer
villages."</p>

<p>"Then why do you remain?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"I came here searching for the son of a friend," replied
Tarzan. "Many weeks ago the young man started out with an
expedition to explore the Wiramwazi Mountains in which
your country is located. His people deserted him upon the
outer slopes, and I am convinced that he is somewhere within
the range and very possibly in this canyon. If he is here and
alive, he will unquestionably come sooner or later to your
city where, from the experience that I have gained, I am sure
that he will receive anything but friendly treatment from
your Emperor. This is the reason that I wish to remain somewhere
in the vicinity, and now that you have told me that you
are in danger, I may as well remain in your home where it is
possible I may have an opportunity to reciprocate your kindness
to me."</p>

<p>"If the son of your friend is in this end of the valley, he
will be captured and brought to Castra Sanguinarius," said
Maximus Praeclarus, "and when that occurs I shall know of
it, since I am detailed to duty at the Colosseum&mdash;a mark of
the disfavour of Sublatus, since this is the most distasteful
duty to which an officer can be assigned."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that this man for whom I am searching
might be in some other part of the valley?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No," replied Praeclarus. "There is only one entrance to
the valley, that through which you were brought, and while
there is another city at the eastern end, he could not reach it
without passing through the forests surrounding Castra Sanguinarius,
in which event he would have been captured by
the barbarians and turned over to Sublatus."</p>

<p>"Then I shall remain here," said Tarzan, "for a time."</p>

<p>"You shall be a welcome guest," replied Praeclarus.</p>

<p>For three weeks Tarzan remained in the home of Maximus
Praeclarus. Festivitas conceived a great liking for the bronzed
barbarian, and soon tiring of carrying on conversation with
him through an interpreter, she set about teaching him her
own language, with the result that it was not long before
Tarzan could carry on a conversation in Latin; nor did he
lack opportunity to practise his new accomplishment, since
Festivitas never tired of hearing stories of the outer world
and of the manners and customs of modern civilization.</p>

<p>And while Tarzan of the Apes waited in Castra Sanguinarius
for word that von Harben had been seen in the valley,
the man he sought was living the life of a young patrician
attached to the court of the Emperor of the East, and though
much of his time was pleasantly employed in the palace
library, yet he chafed at the knowledge that he was virtually
a prisoner and was often formulating plans for escape&mdash;plans
that were sometimes forgotten when he sat beneath the spell
of the daughter of Septimus Favonius.</p>

<p>And often in the library he discovered only unadulterated
pleasure in his work, and thoughts of escape were driven from
his mind by discoveries of such gems as original Latin translations
of Homer and of hitherto unknown manuscripts of
Virgil, Cicero and Caesar&mdash;manuscripts that dated from the
days of the young republic and on down the centuries to include
one of the early satires of Juvenal.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed, while far off in another world a
frightened little monkey scampered through the upper terraces
of a distant forest.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">A penchant</span> for boasting is not the prerogative of any time,
or race, or individual, but is more or less common to all. So
it is not strange that Mpingu, filled with the importance of
the secret that he alone shared with his mistress, and the
household of Maximus Praeclarus, should have occasionally
dropped a word here and there that might impress his listeners
with his importance.</p>

<p>Mpingu meant no harm. He was loyal to the house of Dion
Splendidus and he would not willingly have brought harm to
his master or his master's friend, but so it is often with people
who talk too much, and Mpingu certainly had done that. The
result was that upon a certain day, as he was bartering in the
market-place for provisions for the kitchen of Dion Splendidus,
he felt a heavy hand upon his shoulder and, turning,
he was astonished to find himself looking into the face of a
centurion of the palace guard, behind whom stood a file of
legionaries.</p>

<p>"You are Mpingu, the slave of Dion Splendidus?" demanded
the centurion.</p>

<p>"I am," replied the black.</p>

<p>"Come with us," commanded the centurion.</p>

<p>Mpingu drew back, afraid, as all men feared the soldiers of
Caesar. "What do you want of me?" he demanded. "I have
done nothing."</p>

<p>"Come, barbarian," ordered the soldier. "I was not sent to
confer with you, but to get you!" And he jerked Mpingu
roughly toward him and pushed him back among the soldiers.</p>

<p>A crowd had gathered, as crowds gather always when a
man is arrested, but the centurion ignored the crowd as
though it did not exist, and the people fell aside as the soldiers
marched away with Mpingu. No one questioned or
interfered, for who would dare question an officer of Caesar?
Who would interfere on behalf of a black slave?</p>

<p>Mpingu thought that he would be taken to the dungeons
beneath the Colosseum which was the common jail in which
all prisoners were confined; but presently he realized that his
captors were not leading him in that direction, and when finally
it dawned upon him that the palace was their goal he was
filled with terror.</p>

<p>Never before had Mpingu stepped foot within the precincts
of the palace grounds, and when the imperial gate closed
behind him he was in a mental state bordering upon collapse.
He had heard stories of the cruelty of Sublatus, of the terrible
vengeance wrecked upon his enemies, and he had visions that
paralysed his mind so that he was in a state of semi-consciousness
when he was finally led into an inner chamber where a
high dignitary of the court confronted him.</p>

<p>"This," said the centurion, who had brought him, "is
Mpingu, the slave of Dion Splendidus, whom I was commanded
to fetch to you."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the official. "You and your detachment may
remain while I question him." Then he turned upon Mpingu.
"Do you know the penalties one incurs for aiding the enemies
of Caesar?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mpingu's lower jaw moved convulsively as though he
would reply, but he was unable to control his voice.</p>

<p>"They die," growled the officer, menacingly. "They die
terrible deaths that they will remember through all eternity."</p>

<p>"I have done nothing," cried Mpingu, suddenly regaining
control of his vocal chords.</p>

<p>"Do not lie to me, barbarian," snapped the official. "You
aided in the escape of the prisoner who called himself Tarzan
and even now you are hiding him from your Emperor."</p>

<p>"I did not help him escape, I am not hiding him," wailed
Mpingu.</p>

<p>"You lie. You know where he is. You boasted of it to other
slaves. Tell me where he is."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Mpingu.</p>

<p>"If your tongue were cut out, you could not tell us where
he is," said the Roman. "If red-hot irons were thrust into
your eyes, you could not see to lead us to his hiding-place;
but if we find him without your help and we surely shall find
him, we shall need neither your tongue nor your eyes. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where he is," repeated Mpingu.</p>

<p>The Roman turned away and struck a single blow upon a
gong, after which he stood in silence until a slave entered
the room in response to the summons. "Fetch tongs," the
Roman instructed the slave, "and a charcoal brazier with
burning-irons. Be quick."</p>

<p>After the slave had left, silence fell again upon the apartment.
The official was giving Mpingu an opportunity to think,
and Mpingu so occupied the time in thinking that it seemed
to him that the slave had scarcely left the apartment before
he returned again with tongs and a lighted burner, from the
glowing heart of which protruded the handle of a burning-iron.</p>

<p>"Have your soldiers throw him to the floor and hold him,"
said the official to the centurion.</p>

<p>It was evident to Mpingu that the end had come; the officer
was not even going to give him another opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>"Well," said the official, "you are regaining your memory?"</p>

<p>"I am only a slave," wailed Mpingu. "I must do what my
masters command."</p>

<p>"And what did they command?" inquired the Roman.</p>

<p>"I was only an interpreter," said Mpingu. "The white barbarian
spoke the language of the Bagegos, who are my people.
Through me they talked to him and he talked to them."</p>

<p>"And what was said?" demanded the inquisitor.</p>

<p>Mpingu hesitated, dropping his eyes to the floor.</p>

<p>"Come, quickly!" snapped the other.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten," said Mpingu.</p>

<p>The official nodded to the centurion. The soldiers seized
Mpingu and threw him roughly to the floor, four of them
holding him there, one seated upon each limb.</p>

<p>"The tongs!" directed the official, and the slave handed the
instrument to the centurion.</p>

<p>"Wait!" screamed Mpingu. "I will tell you."</p>

<p>"Let him up," said the official; and to Mpingu: "This is
your last chance. If you go down again, your tongue comes
out and your eyes, too."</p>

<p>"I will talk," said Mpingu. "I did but interpret, that is all.
I had nothing to do with helping him to escape or hiding him."</p>

<p>"If you tell us the truth, you will not be punished," said
the Roman. "Where is the white barbarian?"</p>

<p>"He is hiding in the home of Maximus Praeclarus," said
Mpingu.</p>

<p>"What has your master to do with this?" commanded the
Roman.</p>

<p>"Dion Splendidus has nothing to do with it," replied
Mpingu. "Maximus Praeclarus planned it."</p>

<p>"That is all," said the official to the centurion. "Take him
away and keep him under guard until you receive further
orders. Be sure that he talks to no one."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the official who had interrogated
Mpingu entered the apartment of Sublatus while the Emperor
was in conversation with his son Fastus.</p>

<p>"I have located the white barbarian, Sublatus," announced
the official.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Emperor. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In the home of Maximus Praeclarus."</p>

<p>"I might have suspected as much," said Fastus.</p>

<p>"Who else is implicated?" asked Sublatus.</p>

<p>"He was caught in the courtyard of Dion Splendidus," said
Fastus, "and the Emperor has heard, as we all have, that
Dion Splendidus has long had eyes upon the imperial purple
of the Caesars."</p>

<p>"The slave says that only Maximus Praeclarus is responsible
for the escape of the barbarian," said the official.</p>

<p>"He was one of Dion Splendidus's slaves, was he not?"
demanded Fastus.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it is not strange that he would protect his master,"
said Fastus.</p>

<p>"Arrest them all," commanded Sublatus.</p>

<p>"You mean Dion Splendidus, Maximus Praeclarus, and the
barbarian Tarzan?" asked the official.</p>

<p>"I mean those three and the entire household of Dion
Splendidus and Maximus Praeclarus," replied Sublatus.</p>

<p>"Wait, Caesar," suggested Fastus; "twice already has the
barbarian escaped from the legionaries. If he receives the
slightest inkling of this, he will escape again. I have a plan.
Listen!"</p>

<p>An hour later a messenger arrived at the home of Dion
Splendidus carrying an invitation to the senator and his wife
to be the guests of a high court functionary that evening at a
banquet. Another messenger went to the home of Maximus
Praeclarus with a letter urging the young officer to attend an
entertainment being given that same evening by a rich young
patrician.</p>

<p>As both invitations had emanated from families high in
favour with the Emperor, they were, in effect, almost equivalent
to commands, even to as influential a senator as Dion
Splendidus, and so there was no question either in the minds
of the hosts or in the minds of the guests but that they would
be accepted.</p>

<p>Night had fallen upon Castra Sanguinarius. Dion Splendidus
and his wife were alighting from their litter before the
home of their host and Maximus Praeclarus was already
drinking with his fellow guests in the banquet hall of one of
Castra Sanguinarius's wealthiest citizens. Fastus was there,
too, and Maximus Praeclarus was surprised and not a little
puzzled at the friendly attitude of the prince.</p>

<p>"I always suspect something when Fastus smiles at me," he
said to an intimate.</p>

<p>In the home of Dion Splendidus, Dilecta sat among her
female slaves, while one of them told her stories of the wild
African village from which she had come.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Festivitas sat in the home of Maximus Praeclarus,
the Roman matron listening attentively to the stories
of savage Africa and civilized Europe that she was constantly
urging her strange guest to tell her. Faintly they heard a knock
at the outer gate and, presently, a slave came to the apartment
where they sat to tell them that Mpingu, the slave of
Dion Splendidus, had come with a message for Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Bring him hither," said Festivitas, and, shortly, Mpingu
was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>If Tarzan or Festivitas had known Mpingu better, they
would have realized that he was under great nervous strain;
but they did not know him well, and so they saw nothing out
of the way in his manner or bearing.</p>

<p>"I have been sent to fetch you to the home of Dion Splendidus,"
said Mpingu to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That is strange," said Festivitas.</p>

<p>"Your noble son stopped at the home of Dion Splendidus
on his way to the banquet this evening and as he left I was
summoned and told to come hither and fetch the stranger to
my master's house," explained Mpingu. "That is all I know
about the matter."</p>

<p>"Maximus Praeclarus gave you those instructions himself?"
asked Festivitas.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mpingu.</p>

<p>"I do not know what his reason can be," said Festivitas to
Tarzan, "but there must be some very good reason, or he
would not run the risk of your being caught."</p>

<p>"It is very dark out," said Mpingu. "No one will see him."</p>

<p>"There is no danger," said Tarzan to Festivitas. "Maximus
Praeclarus would not have sent for me unless it were necessary.
Come, Mpingu!" And he arose, bidding Festivitas goodbye.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Mpingu had proceeded but a short distance
down the avenue when the black motioned the ape-man to
the side of the street, where a small gate was let into a solid
wall.</p>

<p>"We are here," said Mpingu.</p>

<p>"This is not the home of Dion Splendidus," said Tarzan,
immediately suspicious.</p>

<p>Mpingu was surprised that this stranger should so well remember
the location of a house that he had visited but once,
and that more than three weeks since, but he did not know
the training that had been the ape-man's through the long
years of moving through the trackless jungle that had trained
his every sense and faculty to the finest point of orientation.</p>

<p>"It is not the main gate," replied Mpingu, quickly, "but
Maximus Praeclarus did not think it safe that you be seen
entering the main gate of the home of Dion Splendidus in
the event that, by any chance, you were observed. This way
leads into a lane that might connect with any one of several
homes, and once in it there is little or no chance of apprehension."</p>

<p>"I see," said Tarzan. "Lead the way."</p>

<p>Mpingu opened the gate and motioned Tarzan in ahead of
him, and as the ape-man passed through into the blackness
beyond there fell upon him what seemed to be a score of men
and he was borne down in the same instant that he realized
that he had been betrayed. So rapidly did his assailants work
that it was a matter of seconds only before the ape-man found
shackles upon his wrists, the one thing that he feared and
hated most.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">While</span> Erich von Harben wooed Favonia beneath a summer
moon in the garden of Septimus Favonius in the island city
of Castrum Mare, a detachment of the brown legionaries of
Sublatus Imperator dragged Tarzan of the Apes and Mpingu,
the black slave of Dion Splendidus, to the dungeons beneath
the Colosseum of Castra Sanguinarius&mdash;and far to the south
a little monkey shivered from cold and terror in the topmost
branches of a jungle giant, while Sheeta the panther crept
softly through the black shadows far below.</p>

<p>In the banquet hall of his host, Maximus Praeclarus reclined
upon a sofa far down the board from Fastus, the guest
of honour. The prince, his tongue loosened by frequent
draughts of native wine, seemed in unusually good spirits,
radiating self-satisfaction. Several times he had brought the
subject of conversation around to the strange white barbarian,
who had insulted his sire and twice escaped from the soldiers
of Sublatus.</p>

<p>"He would never have escaped from me that day," he
boasted, throwing a sneer in the direction of Maximus Praeclarus,
"nor from any other officer who is loyal to Caesar."</p>

<p>"You had him, Fastus, in the garden of Dion Splendidus,"
retorted Praeclarus. "Why did you not hold him?"</p>

<p>Fastus flushed. "I shall hold him this time," he blurted.</p>

<p>"This time?" queried Praeclarus. "He has been captured
again?" There was nothing in either the voice or expression
of the young patrician of more than polite interest, though
the words of Fastus had come with all the unexpected suddenness
of lightning out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>"I mean," explained Fastus, in some confusion, "that if he
is again captured I, personally, shall see that he does not
escape," but his words did not allay the apprehensions of
Praeclarus.</p>

<p>All through the long dinner Praeclarus was cognisant of a
sensation of foreboding. There was a menace in the air that
was apparent in the veiled hostility of his host and several
others who were cronies of Fastus.</p>

<p>As early as was seemly he made his excuses and departed.
Armed slaves accompanied his litter through the dark avenues
of Castra Sanguinarius, where robbery and murder slunk
among the shadows hand in hand with the criminal element
that had been permitted to propagate itself without restraint;
and when at last he came to the doorway at his home and had
alighted from his litter he paused and a frown of perplexity
clouded his face as he saw that the door stood partially ajar,
though there was no slave there to receive him.</p>

<p>The house seemed unusually quiet and lifeless. The night
light, which ordinarily a slave kept burning in the forecourt
when a member of the household was away, was absent. For
an instant Praeclarus hesitated upon the threshold and then,
pushing his cloak back from his shoulders to free his arms,
he pushed the door open and stepped within.</p>

<hr class="tbk">

<p>In the banquet hall of a high court functionary the guests
yawned behind their hands from boredom, but none dared
leave while Caesar remained, for the Emperor was a guest
there that evening. It was late when an officer brought a
message to Sublatus&mdash;a message that the Emperor read with
a satisfaction he made no effort to conceal.</p>

<p>"I have received an important message," said Sublatus to
his host, "upon a matter that interests the noble Senator Dion
Splendidus and his wife. It is my wish that you withdraw with
the other guests, leaving us three here alone."</p>

<p>When they had gone he turned to Dion Splendidus. "It has
long been rumoured, Splendidus," he remarked, "that you
aspire to the purple."</p>

<p>"A false rumour, Sublatus, as you should well know," replied
the senator.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe otherwise," said Sublatus, shortly.
"There cannot be two Caesars, Splendidus, and you well know
the penalty for treason."</p>

<p>"If the Emperor has determined, for personal reasons or
for any reason whatever, to destroy me, argument will avail
me nothing," said Splendidus, haughtily.</p>

<p>"But I have other plans," said Sublatus, "&mdash;plans that might
be overturned should I cause your death."</p>

<p>"Yes?" inquired Splendidus, politely.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Sublatus. "My son wishes to marry your
daughter, Dilecta, and it is also my wish, for thus would the
two most powerful families of Castra Sanguinarius be united
and the future of the empire assured."</p>

<p>"But our daughter, Dilecta, is betrothed to another," said
Splendidus.</p>

<p>"To Maximus Praeclarus?" inquired Sublatus.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the senator.</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you that she shall never wed Maximus
Praeclarus," said the Emperor.</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired Splendidus.</p>

<p>"Because Maximus Praeclarus is about to die."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Splendidus.</p>

<p>"Perhaps when I tell you that the white barbarian, Tarzan,
has been captured, you will understand why Praeclarus is
about to die," said Sublatus, with a sneer.</p>

<p>Dion Splendidus shook his head negatively. "I regret," he
said, "that I do not follow Caesar."</p>

<p>"I think you do, Splendidus," said the Emperor, "but that is
neither here nor there, since it is Caesar's will that there be no
breath of suspicion upon the sire of the next Empress of
Castra Sanguinarius. So permit me to explain what I am sure
that you already know. After the white barbarian escaped
from my soldiers he was found by Maximus Praeclarus in
your garden. My son, Fastus, witnessed the capture. One of
your own slaves acted as interpreter between the barbarian
and Maximus, who arranged that the barbarian should escape
and take refuge in the home of Maximus. Tonight he was
found there and captured, and Maximus Praeclarus has been
placed under arrest. They are both in the dungeons beneath
the Colosseum. It is improbable that these things should have
transpired entirely without your knowledge, but I shall let it
pass if you give your word that Dilecta shall marry Fastus."</p>

<p>"During the entire history of Castra Sanguinarius," said
Dion Splendidus, "it has been our boast that our daughters
have been free to choose their own husbands&mdash;not even a
Caesar might command a free woman to marry against her
will."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied Sublatus, "and for that very reason
I do not command&mdash;I am only advising."</p>

<p>"I cannot answer for my daughter," said Splendidus.  "Let the
son of Caesar do his own wooing as becomes the men of Castra
Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>Sublatus arose. "I am only advising," but his tone belied
his words. "The noble senator and his wife may retire to their
home and give thought to what Caesar has said. In the course
of a few days Fastus will come for his answer."</p>

<p>By the light of the torch that illuminated the interior of the
dungeon into which he was thrust by his captors, Tarzan saw
a white man and several blacks chained to the walls. Among
the blacks was Lukedi, but when he recognized Tarzan he
evinced only the faintest sign of interest, so greatly had his
confinement weighed upon his mind and altered him.</p>

<p>The ape-man was chained next to the only other white in
the dungeon, and he could not help but notice the keen
interest that this prisoner took in him from the moment that
he entered until the soldiers withdrew, taking the torch with
them, leaving the dungeon in darkness.</p>

<p>As had been his custom while he was in the home of Maximus
Praeclarus, Tarzan had worn only his loin-cloth and
leopard-skin, with a toga and sandals out of courtesy for
Festivitas when he appeared in her presence. This evening
when he started out with Mpingu, he had worn the toga as a
disguise, but in the scuffle that preceded his capture it had
been torn from him, with the result that his appearance was
sufficient to arouse the curiosity of his fellow prisoners, and
as soon as the guards were out of hearing the man spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"Can it be," he asked, "that you are the white barbarian
whose fame has penetrated even to the gloom and silence of
the dungeon?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And you carried Sublatus out of his palace above your
head and mocked at his soldiers!" exclaimed the other. "By
the ashes of my imperial father, Sublatus will see that you die
the death."</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply.</p>

<p>"They say you run through the trees like a monkey," said
the other. "How then did you permit yourself to be recaptured?"</p>

<p>"It was done by treachery," replied Tarzan, "and the quickness
with which they locked the shackles upon me. Without
these," and he shook the manacles upon his wrists, "they
could not hold me. But who are you and what did you do to
get yourself in the dungeons of Caesar?"</p>

<p>"I am in the dungeon of no Caesar," replied the other. "This
creature who sits upon the throne of Castra Sanguinarius is
no Caesar."</p>

<p>"Who then is Caesar?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Only the Emperors of the East are entitled to be called
Caesar," replied the other.</p>

<p>"I take it that you are not of Castra Sanguinarius then,"
suggested the ape-man.</p>

<p>"No," replied the other, "I am from Castrum Mare."</p>

<p>"And why are you a prisoner?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Because I am from Castrum Mare," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Is that a crime in Castra Sanguinarius?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We are always enemies," replied the other. "We trade
occasionally under a flag of truce, for we have things that
they want and they have things that we must have, but there
is much raiding and often there are wars, and then whichever
side is victorious takes the things by force that otherwise they
would be compelled to pay for."</p>

<p>"In this small valley what is there that one of you may
have that the other one has not already?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We of Castrum Mare have the iron mines," replied the
other, "and we have the papyrus swamps and the lake, which
give us many things that the people of Castra Sanguinarius
can obtain only from us. We sell them iron and paper, ink,
snails, fish and jewels, and many manufactured articles. In
their end of the valley they mine gold, and as they control the
only entrance to the country from the outside world, we are
forced to obtain our slaves through them as well as new
breeding-stock for our herds.</p>

<p>"As the Sanguinarians are naturally thieves and raiders and
are too lazy to work and too ignorant to teach their slaves
how to produce things, they depend entirely upon their gold
mine and their raiding and trading with the outer world, while
we, who have developed many skilled artisans, have been in a
position for many generations that permitted us to obtain
much more gold and many more slaves than we need in return
for our manufactured articles. Today we are much richer
than the Sanguinarians. We live better. We are more cultured.
We are happier and the Sanguinarians are jealous and their
hatred of us has increased."</p>

<p>"Knowing these things," asked Tarzan, "how is it that you
came to the country of your enemies and permitted yourself
to be captured?"</p>

<p>"I was delivered over treacherously into the hands of
Sublatus by my uncle, Validus Augustus, Emperor of the
East," replied the other. "My name is Cassius Hasta, and my
father was Emperor before Validus. Validus is afraid that I
may wish to seize the purple, and for this reason he plotted
to get rid of me without assuming any responsibility for the
act; so he conceived the idea of sending me upon a military
mission, after bribing one of the servants who accompanied
me to deliver me into the hands of Sublatus."</p>

<p>"What will Sublatus do with you?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The same thing that he will do with you," replied Cassius
Hasta. "We shall be exhibited in the triumph of Sublatus,
which he holds annually and then in the arena we shall amuse
them until we are slain."</p>

<p>"And when does this take place?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It will not be long now," replied Cassius Hasta. "Already
they have collected so many black prisoners to exhibit in the
triumph and to take part in the combats in the arena that
they are forced to confine blacks and whites in the same dungeons,
a thing they do not ordinarily do."</p>

<p>"Are these blacks held here for this purpose?" asked the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned in the direction of Lukedi, whom he could
not see in the darkness. "Lukedi!" he called.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the black, listlessly.</p>

<p>"You are well?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I am going to die," replied Lukedi. "They will feed me to
lions or burn me upon a cross or make me fight with other
warriors, so that it will be all the same for Lukedi. It was a
sad day when Nyuto, the chief, captured Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Are all these blacks from your village?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No," replied Lukedi. "Most of them are from the villages
outside the walls of Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"Yesterday they called us their own people," spoke up a
black, who understood the language of the Bagego, "and tomorrow
they make us kill one another to entertain Caesar."</p>

<p>"You must be very few in numbers or very poor in spirit,"
said Tarzan, "that you submit to such a treatment."</p>

<p>"We number nearly twice as many as the people in the
city," said the black, "and we are brave warriors."</p>

<p>"Then you are fools," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"We shall not be fools for ever. Already there are many
who would rise against Sublatus and the whites of Castra
Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"The blacks of the city as well as the blacks of the outer
villages hate Caesar," said Mpingu, who had been brought to
the dungeon with Tarzan.</p>

<p>The statements of the blacks furnished food for thought to
Tarzan. He knew that in the city there must be hundreds and
perhaps thousands of black slaves and many thousands of
blacks in the outer villages. If a leader should rise among
them, the tyranny of Caesar might be brought to an abrupt
end. He spoke of the matter to Cassius Hasta, but the patrician
assured him that no such leader would ever arise.</p>

<p>"We have dominated them for so many centuries," he explained,
"that fear of us is an inherited instinct. Our blacks
will never rise against their masters."</p>

<p>"But if they did?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Unless they had a white leader they could not succeed,"
replied Hasta.</p>

<p>"And why not a white leader then?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That is unthinkable," replied Hasta.</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a detachment
of soldiers, and as they halted before the entrance
to the dungeon and threw open the gate, Tarzan saw, in the
light of their torches, that they were bringing another prisoner.
As they dragged the man in, he recognized Maximus
Praeclarus. He saw that Praeclarus recognized him, but as
the Roman did not address him, Tarzan kept silent, too.
The soldiers chained Praeclarus to the wall, and after they
had left and the dungeon was in darkness again, the young
officer spoke.</p>

<p>"I see now why I am here," said Praeclarus, "but even
when they set upon me and arrested me in the vestibule of
my home, I had guessed as much, after piecing together the
insinuations of Fastus at the banquet this evening."</p>

<p>"I have been fearful that by befriending me you would
bring disaster upon yourself," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Do not reproach yourself," said Praeclarus. "Fastus or
Sublatus would have found another excuse. I have been
doomed from the moment that the attention of Fastus fixed
itself upon Dilecta. To attain his end it was necessary that I
be destroyed. That is all, my friend, but yet I wonder who it
could have been that betrayed me."</p>

<p>"It was I," said a voice out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Who is that that speaks?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"It is Mpingu," said Tarzan. "He was arrested with me
when we were on the way to the home of Dion Splendidus to
meet you."</p>

<p>"To meet me!" exclaimed Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"I lied," said Mpingu, "but they made me."</p>

<p>"Who made you?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"The officers of Caesar and Caesar's son," replied Mpingu.
"They dragged me to the palace of the Emperor and held me
down upon my back and brought tongs to tear out my tongue
and hot irons to burn out my eyes. Oh, master, what else
could I do? I am only a poor slave and I was afraid and
Caesar is very terrible."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Praeclarus. "I do not blame you,
Mpingu."</p>

<p>"They promised to give me my liberty," said the black,
"but instead they have chained me in this dungeon. Doubtless
I shall die in the arena, but that I do not fear. It was the
tongs and the red-hot irons that made me a coward. Nothing
else could have forced me to betray the friend of my master."</p>

<p>There was but little comfort upon the cold hard stones of
the dungeon floor, but Tarzan, inured to hardship from birth,
slept soundly until the coming of the jailer with food awakened
him several hours after sunrise. Water and coarse bread
were doled out to the inmates of the dungeon by slaves in
charge of a surly half-caste in the uniform of a legionary.</p>

<p>As he ate, Tarzan surveyed his fellow prisoners. There was
Cassius Hasta of Castrum Mare, son of a Caesar, and Maximus
Praeclarus, a patrician of Castra Sanguinarius and
Captain of legionaries. These, with himself, were the only
whites. There was Lukedi, the Bagego who had befriended
him in the village of Nyuto, and Mpingu, the black slave of
Dion Splendidus, who had betrayed him, and now, in the light
from the little barred window, he recognized also another
Bagego&mdash;Ogonyo, who still cast fearful eyes upon Tarzan as
one might upon any person who was on familiar terms with
the ghost of one's grandfather.</p>

<p>In addition to these three blacks, there were five strapping
warriors from the outer villages of Castra Sanguinarius,
picked men chosen because of their superb physique for the
gladiatorial contests that would form so important a part of
the games that would shortly take place in the arena for the
glorification of Caesar and the edification of the masses. The
small room was so crowded that there was barely space upon
the floor for the eleven to stretch their bodies, yet there was
one vacant ring in the stone wall, indicating that the full
capacity of the dungeon had not been reached.</p>

<p>Two days and nights dragged slowly by. The inmates of
the cell amused themselves as best they could, though the
blacks were too downcast to take a lively interest in anything
other than their own sad forebodings.</p>

<p>Tarzan talked much with these and especially with the five
warriors from the outer villages. From long experience with
them he knew the minds and the hearts of black men, and it
was not difficult for him to win their confidence and, presently,
he was able to instill within them something of his own
courageous self-reliance, which could never accept or admit
absolute defeat.</p>

<p>He talked with Praeclarus about Castra Sanguinarius and
with Cassius Hasta about Castrum Mare. He learned all that
they could tell him about the forthcoming triumph and
games; about the military methods of their people, their laws
and their customs until he, who all his life had been accounted
taciturn, might easily have been indicted for loquacity by
his fellow prisoners, yet, though they might not realize it, he
asked them nothing without a well-defined purpose.</p>

<p>Upon the third day of his incarceration another prisoner
was brought to the crowded cell in which Tarzan was chained.
He was a young white man in the tunic and cuirass of an
officer. He was received in silence by the other prisoners,
as seemed to be the custom among them, but after he had
been fastened to the remaining ring and the soldiers who
had brought him had departed, Cassius Hasta greeted him
with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Caecilius Metellus!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The other turned in the direction of Hasta's voice, his
eyes not yet accustomed to the gloom of the dungeon.</p>

<p>"Hasta!" he exclaimed. "I would know that voice were
I to hear it rising from the blackest depths of Tartarus."</p>

<p>"What ill fortune brought you here?" demanded Hasta.</p>

<p>"It is no ill fortune that unites me with my best friend,"
replied Metellus.</p>

<p>"But tell me how it happened," insisted Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"Many things have happened since you left Castrum Mare,"
replied Metellus. "Fulvus Fupus has wormed his way into
the favour of the Emperor to such an extent that all of your
former friends are under suspicion and in actual danger.
Mallius Lepus is in prison. Septimus Favonius is out of
favour with the Emperor and would be in prison himself
were it not that Fupus is in love with Favonia, his daughter.
But the most outrageous news that I have to communicate to
you is that Validus Augustus has adopted Fulvus Fupus and
has named him as his successor to the imperial purple."</p>

<p>"Fupus a Caesar!" cried Hasta, in derision. "And sweet
Favonia? It cannot be that she favours Fulvus Fupus?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Metellus, "and that fact lies at the bottom
of all the trouble. She loves another, and Fupus, in his
desire to possess her, has utilized the Emperor's jealousy
of you to destroy every obstacle that stands in his way."</p>

<p>"And whom does Favonia love?" asked Cassius Hasta. "It
cannot be Mallius Lepus, her cousin?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Metellus, "it is a stranger. One whom you
have never known."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" demanded Cassius Hasta. "Do I not
know every patrician in Castrum Mare?"</p>

<p>"He is not of Castrum Mare."</p>

<p>"Not a Sanguinarian?" demanded Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"No, he is a barbarian chieftain from Germania."</p>

<p>"What nonsense is this?" demanded Hasta.</p>

<p>"I speak the truth," replied Metellus. "He came shortly
after you departed from Castrum Mare, and being a scholar
well versed in the history of ancient and modern Rome he
won the favour of Validus Augustus, but he brought ruin
upon himself and upon Mallius Lepus and upon Septimus
Favonius by winning the love of Favonia and with it the
jealous hatred of Fulvus Fupus."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" asked Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"He calls himself Erich von Harben," replied Metellus.</p>

<p>"Erich von Harben," repeated Tarzan. "I know him. Where
is he now? Is he safe?"</p>

<p>Caecilius Metellus turned his eyes in the direction of the
ape-man. "How do you know Erich von Harben, Sanguinarian?"
he demanded. "Perhaps then the story that Fulvus
Fupus told Validus Augustus is true&mdash;that this Erich von
Harben is in reality a spy from Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>"No," said Maximus Praeclarus. "Do not excite yourself.
This Erich von Harben has never been seen in Castra Sanguinarius,
and my friend here is not himself a Sanguinarian. He
is a white barbarian from the outer world, and if his story
be true, and I have no reason to doubt it, he came here
in search of this Erich von Harben."</p>

<p>"You may believe this story, Metellus," said Cassius Hasta.
"These both are honourable men and since we have been in
prison together we have become good friends. What they
tell you is the truth."</p>

<p>"Tell me something of von Harben," insisted Tarzan.
"Where is he now and is he in danger from the machinations
of this Fulvus Fupus?"</p>

<p>"He is in prison with Mallius Lepus in Castrum Mare,"
replies Metellus, "and if he survives the games, which he
will not, Fupus will find some other means to destroy him."</p>

<p>"When are the games held?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They start upon the ides of August," replied Cassius
Hasta.</p>

<p>"And it is now about the nones of August," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," corrected Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"We shall know it then," said Cassius Hasta, "for that is
the date set for the triumph of Sublatus."</p>

<p>"I am told the games last about a week," said Tarzan.
"How far is it to Castrum Mare?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps an eight hours' march for fresh troops," said
Caecilius Metellus; "but why do you ask? Are you planning
on making a trip to Castrum Mare?"</p>

<p>Tarzan noted the other's smile and the ironic tone of his
voice. "I am going to Castrum Mare," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will take us with you," laughed Metellus.</p>

<p>"Are you a friend of von Harben?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of his friends and an enemy of his enemies,
but I do not know him well enough to say that he is my
friend."</p>

<p>"But you have no love for Validus Augustus, the Emperor?"
asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No," replied the other.</p>

<p>"And I take it that Cassius Hasta has no reason to love his
uncle, either?" continued Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Hasta.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall take you both, then," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>The two men laughed.</p>

<p>"We shall be ready to go with you when you are ready
to take us," said Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"You may count me in on the party, too," said Maximus
Praeclarus, "if Cassius Hasta will remain my friend in Castrum
Mare."</p>

<p>"That I promise, Maximus Praeclarus," said Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"When do we leave?" demanded Metellus, shaking his
chain.</p>

<p>"I can leave the moment that these shackles are struck
from me," said the ape-man, "and that they must do when
they turn me into the arena to fight."</p>

<p>"There will be many legionaries to see that you do not
escape, you may rest assured of that," Cassias Hasta reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Maximus Praeclarus will tell you that I have twice escaped
from the legionaries of Sublatus," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"That he has," declared Praeclarus. "Surrounded by the
Emperor's guard, he escaped from the very throne-room of
Sublatus and he carried Caesar above his head through the
length of the palace and out into the avenue beyond."</p>

<p>"But if I am to take you with me, it will be more difficult,"
said the ape-man, "and I would take you because it would
please me to frustrate the plans of Sublatus and also because
two of you, at least, could be helpful to me in finding Erich
von Harben in the city of Castrum Mare."</p>

<p>"You interest me," said Cassius Hasta. "You almost make
me believe that you can accomplish this mad scheme."</p>

<h2><a id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">A great</span> sun, rising into a cloudless sky, ushered in the nones
of August. It looked down upon the fresh-raked sands of
the deserted arena; upon the crowds that lined the Via
Principalis that bisected Castra Sanguinarius.</p>

<p>Brown artisans and tradesmen in their smart tunics jostled
one another for places of vantage along the shady avenue.
Among them moved black barbarians from the other villages,
sporting their finest feathers and most valued ornaments and
skins, and mingling with the others were the slaves of the
city, all eagerly waiting for the pageant that would inaugurate
the triumph of Sublatus.</p>

<p>Upon the low rooftops of their homes the patricians reclined
upon rugs at every point where the avenue might
be seen between or beneath the branches of the trees. All
Castra Sanguinarius was there, technically to honour Caesar,
but actually merely to be entertained.</p>

<p>The air buzzed with talk and laughter, hawkers of sweet-meats
and trinkets elbowed through the crowd crying their
wares; legionaries posted at intervals the full distance from
the palace to the Colosseum kept the centre of the avenue
clear.</p>

<p>Since the evening of the preceding day the throng had
been gathering. During the cold night they had huddled with
close-drawn cloaks. There had been talk and laughter and
brawls and near-riots, and many would-be spectators had
been hauled off to the dungeons where their exuberance might
be permitted to cool against cold stone.</p>

<p>As the morning dragged on the crowd became restless.
At first, as some patrician who was to have a part in the
pageant passed in his ornate litter he would be viewed in
respectful and interested silence, or if he were well known
and favourably thought of by the multitude he might be
greeted with cheers; but with the passing of time and the
increasing heat of the day each occasional litter that passed
elicited deep-throated groans or raucous catcalls as the
patience and temper of the mob became thinner.</p>

<p>But presently from afar, in the direction of the palace,
sounded the martial notes of trumpets. The people forgot their
fatigue and their discomfort as the shrill notes galvanized
them into joyous expectancy.</p>

<p>Slowly along the avenue came the pageant, led by a score
of trumpeters, behind whom marched a maniple of the imperial
guard. Waving crests surmounted their burnished
helmets, the metal of two hundred cuirasses, pikes, and shields
shot back the sunlight that filtered through the trees beneath
which they marched. They made a proud showing as they
strode haughtily between the lines of admiring eyes, led by
their patrician officers in gold and embossed leather and embroidered
linen.</p>

<p>As the legionaries passed, a great shout of applause arose.
A roar of human voices that started at the palace rolled
slowly along the Via Principalis toward the Colosseum as
Caesar himself, resplendent in purple and gold, rode alone in
a chariot drawn by lions led on golden leashes by huge blacks.</p>

<p>Caesar may have expected for himself the plaudits of the
populace, but there was a question as to whether these were
elicited as much by the presence of the Emperor as by the
sight of the captives chained to Caesar's chariot, for Caesar
was an old story to the people of Castra Sanguinarius, while
the prisoners were a novelty and, furthermore, something that
promised rare sport in the arena.</p>

<p>Never before in the memory of the citizens of Castra Sanguinarius
had an Emperor exhibited such noteworthy captives
in his triumph. There was Nyuto, the black chief of the
Bagegos. There was Caecilius Metellus, a centurion of the
legions of the Emperor of the East; and Cassius Hasta, the
nephew of that Emperor; but perhaps he who aroused their
greatest enthusiasm because of the mad stories that had been
narrated of his feats of strength and agility was the great
white barbarian, with a shock of black hair and his well-worn
leopard-skin.</p>

<p>The collar of gold and the golden chain that held him in
leash to the chariot of Caesar, curiously enough, imparted to
his appearance no suggestion of fear or humiliation. He
walked proudly, with head erect&mdash;a lion tethered to lions&mdash;and
there was that in the easy sinuosity of his stride that
accentuated his likeness to the jungle beasts that drew the
chariot of Caesar along the broad Via Principalis of Castra
Sanguinarius.</p>

<p>As the pageant moved its length slowly to the Colosseum
the crowd found other things to hold their interest. There
were the Bagego captives chained neck to neck and stalwart
gladiators resplendent in new armour. White men and brown
men were numbered among these and many black warriors
from the outer villages.</p>

<p>To the number of two hundred they marched&mdash;captives,
condemned criminals, and professional gladiators&mdash;but before
them and behind them and on either side marched veteran
legionaries whose presence spoke in no uncertain terms of the
respect in which Caesar held the potential power of these
bitter, savage fighting-men.</p>

<p>There were floats depicting historic events in the history of
Castra Sanguinarius and ancient Rome. There were litters
bearing the high officers of the court and the senators of the
city, while bringing up the rear were the captured flocks and
herds of the Bagegos.</p>

<p>That Sublatus failed to exhibit Maximus Praeclarus in his
triumph evidenced the popularity of this noble young Roman,
but Dilecta, watching the procession from the roof of her
father's house, was filled with anxiety when she noted the
absence of her lover, for she knew that sometimes men who
entered the dungeons of Caesar were never more heard of&mdash;but
there was none who could tell her whether Maximus
Praeclarus lived or not, and so with her mother she made her
way to the Colosseum to witness the opening of the games.
Her heart was heavy lest she should see Maximus Praeclarus
entered there, and his blood upon the white sand, yet, also,
she feared that she might not see him and thus be faced by
the almost definite assurance that he had been secretly done
to death by the agents of Fastus.</p>

<p>A great multitude had gathered in the Colosseum to witness
the entry of Caesar and the pageant of his triumph, and the
majority of these remained in their seats for the opening of
the games, which commenced early in the afternoon. It was
not until then that the sections reserved for the patricians began
to fill.</p>

<p>The loge reserved for Dion Splendidus, the senator, was
close to that of Caesar. It afforded an excellent view of the
arena and with cushions and rugs was so furnished as to
afford the maximum comfort to those who occupied it.</p>

<p>Never had a Caesar essayed so pretentious a fte; entertainment
of the rarest description was vouchsafed each lucky
spectator, yet never before in her life had Dilecta loathed and
dreaded any occurrence as she now loathed and dreaded the
games that were about to open.</p>

<p>Always heretofore her interest in the contestants had been
impersonal. Professional gladiators were not of the class to
come within the ken or acquaintance of the daughter of a
patrician. The black warriors and slaves were to her of no
greater importance than the beasts against which they sometimes
contended, while the condemned criminals many of
whom expiated their sins within the arena, aroused within her
heart only the remotest suggestion of sympathy. She was a
sweet and lovely girl, whose sensibilities would doubtless have
been shocked by the brutality of the prize-ring or a varsity
football game, but she could look upon the bloody cruelties
of a Roman arena without a qualm, because by custom and
heredity they had become a part of the national life of her
people.</p>

<p>But today she trembled. She saw the games as a personal
menace to her own happiness and the life of one she loved,
yet by no outward sign did she divulge her perturbation.
Calm, serene, and entirely beautiful, Dilecta, the daughter of
Dion Splendidus, awaited the signal for the opening of the
games that was marked by the arrival of Caesar.</p>

<p>Sublatus came, and after he had taken his seat there
emerged from one of the barred gates at the far end of the
arena the head of a procession again led by trumpeters, who
were followed by those who were to take part in the games
during the week. It consisted for the most part of the same
captives who had been exhibited in the pageant, to which were
added a number of wild beasts, some of which were led or
dragged along by black slaves, while others, more powerful
and ferocious, were drawn in wheeled cages. These consisted
principally of lions and leopards, but there were also a couple
of bull buffaloes and several cages in which were confined
huge man-like apes.</p>

<p>The participants were formed in a solid phalanx facing
Sublatus, where they were addressed by the Emperor, freedom
and reward being promised the victors; and then, sullen and
glowering, they were herded back to their dungeons and cages.</p>

<p>Dilecta's eyes scanned the faces of the contestants as they
stood in solid rank before the loge of Caesar, but nowhere
among them could she discover Maximus Praeclarus. Breathless
and tense, with fearful apprehension, she leaned forward
in her seat across the top of the arena wall as a man entered
the loge from behind and sat upon the bench beside her.</p>

<p>"He is not there," said the man.</p>

<p>The girl turned quickly toward the speaker. "Fastus!" she
exclaimed. "How do you know that he is not there?"</p>

<p>"It is by my order," replied the prince.</p>

<p>"He is dead," cried Dilecta. "You have had him killed."</p>

<p>"No," denied Fastus, "he is safe in his cell."</p>

<p>"What is to become of him?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"His fate lies in your hands," replied Fastus. "Give him up
and promise to become the wife of Fastus and I will see that
he is not forced to appear in the arena."</p>

<p>"He would not have it so," said the girl.</p>

<p>Fastus shrugged. "As you will," he said, "but remember
that his life is in your hands."</p>

<p>"With sword or dagger, or pike he has no equal," said the
girl, proudly. "If he were entered in the contest, he would be
victorious."</p>

<p>"Caesar has been known to pit unarmed men against lions,"
Fastus reminded her, tauntingly. "Of what avail then is
prowess with any weapon?"</p>

<p>"That would be murder," said Dilecta.</p>

<p>"A harsh term to apply to an act of Caesar," returned Fastus,
menacingly.</p>

<p>"I speak my mind," said the girl; "Caesar or no Caesar. It
would be a cowardly and contemptible act, but I doubt not
that either Caesar or his son is capable of even worse." Her
voice trembled with scathing contempt.</p>

<p>With a crooked smile upon his lips, Fastus arose. "It is not
a matter to be determined without thought," he said, "and
your answer concerns not Maximus Praeclarus alone, nor
you, nor me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There are Dion Splendidus and your mother, and Festivitas,
the mother of Praeclarus!" And with this warning he
turned and left the loge.</p>

<p>The games progressed amid the din of trumpets, the crash
of arms, the growling of beasts, and the murmuring of the
great audience that sometimes rose to wild acclaim or deep-throated,
menacing disapproval. Beneath fluttering banners
and waving scarves the cruel, terrible thousand-eyed thing that
is a crowd looked down upon the blood and suffering of its
fellow men, munching sweetmeats while a victim died and
cracking coarse jokes as slaves dragged the body from the
arena and raked clean sand over crimsoned spots.</p>

<p>Sublatus had worked long and carefully with the praefect
in charge of the games that the resultant programme might
afford the greatest possible entertainment for Caesar and the
populace, thus winning for the Emperor a certain popularity
that his own personality did not command.</p>

<p>Always the most popular events were those in which men
of the patrician class participated, and so he counted much
upon Cassius Hasta and Caecilius Metellus, but of even greater
value for his purpose was the giant white barbarian, who
had already captured the imagination of the people because
of his exploits.</p>

<p>Wishing to utilize Tarzan in as many events as possible,
Sublatus knew it would be necessary to reserve the more
dangerous ones for the latter part of the week, and so upon
the first afternoon of the games Tarzan found himself thrust
into the arena, unarmed, in company with a burly murderer,
whom the master of the games had clothed in loin-cloth and
leopard-skin similar to Tarzan.</p>

<p>A guard escorted them across the arena and halted them
in the sand below the Emperor, where the master of the games
announced that these two would fight with bare hands in any
way that they saw fit and that he who remained alive or alone
in the arena at the end of the combat would be considered
victorious.</p>

<p>"The gate to the dungeons will be left open," he said, "and
if either contestant gets enough he may quit the arena, but
whoever does so forfeits the contest to the other."</p>

<p>The crowd booed. It was not to see such tame exhibitions
as this that they had come to the Colosseum. They wanted
blood. They wanted thrills, but they waited, for perhaps this
contest might afford comedy&mdash;that they enjoyed, too. If one
greatly outclassed the other, it would be amusing to see the
weaker seek escape. They cheered Tarzan and they cheered
the low-browed murderer. They shouted insults at the noble
patrician who was master of the games, for they knew the
safety and irresponsibility of numbers.</p>

<p>As the word was given for the contestants to engage one
another Tarzan turned to face the low-browed, hulking brute
against whom he had been pitted and he saw that someone
had been at pains to select a worthy antagonist for him. The
man was somewhat shorter than Tarzan, but great, hard
muscles bulged beneath his brown hide, bulking so thick
across his back and shoulders as almost to suggest deformity.
His long arms hung almost to his knees, and his thick, gnarled
legs suggested a man of bronze upon a pedestal of granite.
The fellow circled Tarzan looking for an opening. He scowled
ferociously as though to frighten his adversary.</p>

<p>"There is the gate, barbarian," he cried in a low voice,
pointing to the far end of the arena. "Escape while you are
yet alive."</p>

<p>The crowd roared in approbation. It enjoyed glorious sallies
such as these. "I shall tear you limb from limb," shouted the
murderer, and again the crowd applauded.</p>

<p>"I am here," said Tarzan calmly.</p>

<p>"Flee!" screamed the murderer, and lowering his head he
charged like an angry bull.</p>

<p>The ape-man sprang into the air and came down upon his
antagonist, and what happened happened so quickly that no
one there, other than Tarzan, knew how it had been accomplished;
only he knew that he clamped a reverse headlock
upon the murderer.</p>

<p>What the crowd saw was the hulking figure hurtling to a
hard fall. They saw him lying half-stunned upon the sand,
while the giant barbarian stood with folded arms looking
down upon him.</p>

<p>The fickle crowd rose from its benches, shrieking with delight.
"Habet! Habet!" they cried, and thousands of closed
fists were outstretched with the thumbs pointing downward,
but Tarzan only stood there waiting, as the murderer, shaking
his head to clear his brain, crawled slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>The fellow looked about him half-bewildered and then his
eyes found Tarzan and with a growl of rage he charged again.
Again the terrible hold was clamped upon him, and again he
was hurled heavily to the floor of the arena.</p>

<p>The crowd screamed with delight. Every thumb in the Colosseum
was pointed downward. They wanted Tarzan to kill
his adversary. The ape-man looked up into Caesar's loge,
where sat the master of the games with Sublatus.</p>

<p>"Is not this enough?" he demanded, pointing at the prostrate
figure of the stunned gladiator.</p>

<p>The praefect waved a hand in an all-including gesture
which took in the audience. "They demand his death," he said.
"While he remains alive in the arena, you are not the victor."</p>

<p>"Does Caesar require that I kill this defenceless man?" demanded
Tarzan, looking straight into the face of Sublatus.</p>

<p>"You have heard the noble praefect," replied the Emperor,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Good," said Tarzan. "The rules of the contest shall be fulfilled."
He stooped and seized the unconscious form of his
antagonist and raised it above his head. "Thus I carried your
Emperor from his throne-room to the avenue!" he shouted to
the audience.</p>

<p>Screams of delight measured the appreciation of the populace,
while Caesar went white and red in anger and mortification.
He half rose from his seat, but what he contemplated
was never fulfilled, for at that instant Tarzan swung the body
of the murderer downward and back like a huge pendulum
and then upward with a mighty surge, hurling it over the
arena wall, full into the loge of Sublatus, where it struck
Caesar, knocking him to the floor.</p>

<p>"I am alive and alone in the arena," shouted Tarzan, turning
to the people, "and by the terms of the contest I am
victor," and not even Caesar dared question the decision that
was voiced by the shrieking, screaming, applauding multitude.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Bloody</span> days followed restless nights in comfortless cells,
where lice and rats joined forces to banish rest. When the
games began there had been twelve inmates in the cell occupied
by Tarzan, but now three empty rings dangled against
the stone wall, and each day they wondered whose turn was
next.</p>

<p>The others did not reproach Tarzan because of his failure
to free them, since they had never taken his optimism seriously.
They could not conceive of contestants escaping from the
arena during the games. It simply was not done and that was
all there was to it. It never had been done, and it never would
be.</p>

<p>"We know you meant well," said Praeclarus, "but we knew
better than you."</p>

<p>"The conditions have not been right, as yet," said Tarzan,
"but if what I have been told of the games is true, the time
will come."</p>

<p>"What time could be propitious," asked Hasta, "while more
than half of Caesar's legionaries packed the Colosseum?"</p>

<p>"There should be a time," Tarzan reminded him, "when all
the victorious contestants are in the arena together. Then we
shall rush Caesar's loge and drag him into the arena. With
Sublatus as a hostage we may demand a hearing and get it. I
venture to say that they will give us our liberty in return for
Caesar."</p>

<p>"But how can we enter Caesar's loge?" demanded Metellus.</p>

<p>"In an instant we may form steps with living men stooping,
while others step upon their backs as soldiers scale a wall.
Perhaps some of us will be killed, but enough will succeed to
seize Caesar and drag him to the sands."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," said Praeclarus, "and by Jupiter, I believe
that you will succeed. I only wish that I might be with
you."</p>

<p>"You will not accompany us?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"How can I? I shall be locked in this cell. Is it not evident
that they do not intend to enter me in the contests? They are
reserving for me some other fate. The jailer has told me that
my name appears in no event."</p>

<p>"But we must find a way to take you with us," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"There is no way," said Praeclarus, shaking his head, sadly.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Tarzan. "You commanded the Colosseum
guards, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"And you had the keys to the cells?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Praeclarus, "and to the manacles as well."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Tarzan. "But no, that will not do.
They must have taken them from you when they arrested
you."</p>

<p>"No they did not," said Praeclarus. "As a matter of fact, I
did not have them with me when I dressed for the banquet
that night. I left them in my room."</p>

<p>"But perhaps they sent for them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they sent for them, but they did not find them. The
jailer asked me about them the day after I was arrested, but I
told him that the soldiers took them from me. I told him that
because I had hidden them in a secret place where I keep
many valuables. I knew that if I had told them where they
were they would take not only the keys, but my valuables as
well."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the ape-man. "With the keys our problem
is solved."</p>

<p>"But how are you going to get them?" demanded Praeclarus,
with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Tarzan. "All I know is that we must
have the keys."</p>

<p>"We know, too, that we should have our liberty," said
Hasta, "but knowing it does not make us free."</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the approach of
soldiers along the corridor. Presently a detachment of the
palace guards halted outside their cell. The jailer unlocked
the door and a man entered with two torch-bearers behind
him. It was Fastus.</p>

<p>He looked around the cell. "Where is Praeclarus?" he demanded,
and then, "Ah, there you are!"</p>

<p>Praeclarus did not reply.</p>

<p>"Stand up, slave!" ordered Fastus, arrogantly. "Stand up,
all of you. How dare you sit in the presence of a Caesar!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Swine is a better title for such as you," taunted Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Drag them up! Beat them with your pikes!" cried Fastus
to the soldiers outside the doorway.</p>

<p>The commander of the Colosseum guard, who stood just
behind Fastus, blocked the doorway. "Stand back," he said to
the legionaries. "No one gives orders here except Caesar and
myself, and you are not Caesar yet, Fastus."</p>

<p>"I shall be one day," snapped the prince, "and it will be a
sad day for you."</p>

<p>"It will be a sad day for all Castra Sanguinarius," replied
the officer. "You said that you wished to speak to Praeclarus?
Say what you have to say and be gone. Not even Caesar's
son may interfere with my charges."</p>

<p>Fastus trembled with anger, but he knew that he was
powerless. The commander of the guard spoke with the
authority of the Emperor, whom he represented. He turned
upon Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"I came to invite my good friend, Maximus Praeclarus, to
my wedding," he announced, with a sneer. He waited, but
Praeclarus made no reply. "You do not seem duly impressed,
Praeclarus," continued the prince. "You do not ask who is to
be the happy bride. Do you not wish to know who will be the
next Empress in Castra Sanguinarius, even though you may
not live to see her upon the throne beside Caesar?"</p>

<p>The heart of Maximus Praeclarus stood still, for now he
knew why Fastus had come to the dungeon-cell, but he gave
no sign of what was passing within his breast, but remained
seated in silence upon the hard floor, his back against the cold
wall.</p>

<p>"You do not ask me whom I am to wed, nor when," continued
Fastus, "but I shall tell you. You should be interested.
Dilecta, the daughter of Dion Splendidus, will have none of a
traitor and a felon. She aspires to share the purple with
Caesar. In the evening following the last day of the games
Dilecta and Fastus are to be married in the throne-room of
the palace."</p>

<p>Gloating, Fastus waited to know the result of his announcement,
but if he had looked to surprise Maximus Praeclarus
into an exhibition of chagrin he failed, for the young patrician
ignored him so completely that Fastus might not have been in
the cell at all for all the attention that the other paid to him.</p>

<p>Maximus Praeclarus turned and spoke casually to Metellus
and the quiet affront aroused the mounting anger of Fastus
to such an extent that he lost what little control he had of
himself. Stepping quickly forward, he stooped and slapped
Praeclarus in the face and then spat upon him, but in doing
so he had come too close to Tarzan and the ape-man reached
out and seized him by the ankle, dragging him to the floor.</p>

<p>Fastus screamed a command to his soldiers. He sought to
draw his dagger or his sword, but Tarzan took them from him
and hurled the prince into the arms of the legionaries, who
had rushed past the commander of the Colosseum guard and
entered the cell.</p>

<p>"Get out now, Fastus," said the latter. "You have caused
enough trouble here already."</p>

<p>"I shall get you for this," hissed the prince, "all of you,"
and he swept the inmates of the cell with an angry, menacing
glance.</p>

<p>Long after they had gone, Cassius Hasta continued to
chuckle. "Caesar!" he exclaimed. "Swine!"</p>

<p>As the prisoners discussed the discomfiture of Fastus and
sought to prophesy what might come of it, they saw a wavering
light reflected from afar in the corridor before their cell.</p>

<p>"We are to have more guests," said Metellus.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Fastus is returning to spit on Tarzan," suggested
Cassius Hasta, and they all laughed.</p>

<p>The light was advancing along the corridor, but it was not
accompanied by the tramp of soldiers' feet.</p>

<p>"Whoever comes comes silently and alone," said Maximus
Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Then it is not Fastus," said Hasta.</p>

<p>"But it might be an assassin sent by him," suggested Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"We shall be ready for him," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>A moment later there appeared beyond the grating of the
cell door the commander of the Colosseum guards, who had
accompanied Fastus and who had stood between the prince
and the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Appius Applosus!" exclaimed Maximus Praeclarus. "He
is no assassin, my friends."</p>

<p>"I am not the assassin of your body, Praeclarus," said
Applosus, "but I am indeed the assassin of your happiness."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my friend?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"In his anger Fastus told me more than he told you."</p>

<p>"He told you what?" asked Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"He told me that Dilecta had consented to become his wife
only in the hope of saving her father and mother and you,
Praeclarus, and your mother, Festivitas."</p>

<p>"To call him swine is to insult the swine," said Praeclarus.
"Take word to her, Applosus, that I would rather die than to
see her wed to Fastus."</p>

<p>"She knows that, my friend," said the officer, "but she
thinks also of her father and her mother and yours."</p>

<p>Praeclarus's chin dropped upon his chest. "I had forgotten
that," he moaned. "Oh, there must be some way to stop it."</p>

<p>"He is the son of Caesar," Applosus reminded him, "and
the time is short."</p>

<p>"I know it! I know it!" cried Praeclarus, "but it is too
hideous. It cannot be."</p>

<p>"This officer is your friend, Praeclarus?" asked Tarzan, indicating
Appius Applosus.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"You would trust him fully?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"With my life and my honour," said Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Tell him where your keys are and let him fetch them,"
said the ape-man.</p>

<p>Praeclarus brightened instantly. "I had not thought of that,"
he cried, "but no, his life would be in jeopardy."</p>

<p>"It already is," said Applosus. "Fastus will never forget or
forgive what I said tonight. You, Praeclarus, know that I am
already doomed. What keys do you want? Where are they?
I will fetch them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not when you know what they are," said Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"I can guess," replied Appius Applosus.</p>

<p>"You have been in my apartments often, Applosus?"</p>

<p>The other nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"You recall the shelves near the window where my books
lie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The back of the third shelf slides to one side and behind
it, in the wall, you will find the keys."</p>

<p>"Good, Praeclarus. You shall have them," said the officer.</p>

<p>The others watched the diminishing light as Appius Applosus
departed along the corridor beneath the Colosseum.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The last day of the games had come. The bloodthirsty
populace had gathered once more as eager and enthusiastic as
though they were about to experience a new and unfamiliar
thrill, their appetites swept as clean of the memories of the
past week as were the fresh sands of the arena of the brown
stains of yesterday.</p>

<p>For the last time the inmates of the cell were taken to enclosures
nearer to the entrance to the arena. They had fared
better, perhaps, than others, for of the twelve rings only four
were empty.</p>

<p>Maximus Praeclarus alone was left behind. "Goodbye," he
said. "Those of you who survive the day shall be free. We
shall not see one another again. Good luck to you and may
the gods give strength and skill to your arms&mdash;that is all that
I can ask of them, for not even the gods could give you more
courage than you already possess."</p>

<p>"Applosus has failed us," said Hasta.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked troubled. "If only you were coming out with
us, Praeclarus, we should not then need the keys."</p>

<p>From within the enclosure, where they were confined, Tarzan
and his companions could hear the sounds of combat and
the groans and hoots and applause of the audience, but they
could not see the floor of the arena.</p>

<p>It was a very large room with heavily barred windows and
a door. Sometimes two men, sometimes four, sometimes six
would go out together, but only one, or two, or three returned.
The effect upon the nerves of those who remained uncalled
was maddening. For some the suspense became almost unendurable.
Two attempted suicide and others tried to pick
quarrels with their fellow prisoners, but there were many
guards within the room and the prisoners were unarmed, their
weapons being issued to them only after they had quit the
enclosure and were about to enter the arena.</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close. Metellus had fought
with a gladiator, both in full armour. Hasta and Tarzan had
heard the excited cries of the populace. They had heard cheer
after cheer, which indicated that each man was putting up a
skilful and courageous fight. There was an instant of silence
and then the loud cries of "<span class="it">Habet! Habet!</span>"</p>

<p>"It is over," whispered Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply. He had grown to like these men, for
he had found them brave and simple and loyal and he, too,
was inwardly moved by the suspense that must be endured
until one or the other returned to the enclosure; but he gave
no outward sign of his perturbation, and while Cassius Hasta
paced nervously to and fro Tarzan of the Apes stood silently,
with folded arms, watching the door. After a while it opened
and Caecilius Metellus crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Cassius Hasta uttered a cry of relief and sprang forward
to embrace his friend.</p>

<p>Again the door swung open and a minor official entered.
"Come," he cried, "all of you. It is the last event."</p>

<p>Outside the enclosure each man was given a sword, dagger,
pike, shield, and a hempen net, and one by one, as they were
thus equipped, they were sent into the arena. All the survivors
of the week of combat were there&mdash;one hundred of them.</p>

<p>They were divided into two equal parties, and red ribbons
were fastened to the shoulders of one party and white ribbons
to the shoulders of the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan was among the reds, as were Hasta, Metellus,
Lukedi, Mpingu, and Ogonyo.</p>

<p>"What are we supposed to do?" asked Tarzan of Hasta.</p>

<p>"The reds will fight against the whites until all the reds are
killed or all the whites."</p>

<p>"They should see blood enough to suit them now," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They can never get enough of it," replied Metellus.</p>

<p>The two parties marched to the opposite end of the arena
and received their instructions from the praefect in charge of
the games, and then they were formed, the reds upon one side
of the arena, the whites upon the other. Trumpets sounded
and the armed men advanced toward one another.</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled to himself as he considered the weapons with
which he was supposed to defend himself. The pike he was
sure of, for the Waziri are great spearmen and Tarzan excelled
even among them, and with the dagger he felt at home,
so long had the hunting-knife of his father been his only
weapon of protection&mdash;but the Spanish sword, he felt, would
probably prove more of a liability than an asset, while the net
in his hands could be nothing more than a sorry joke. He
would like to have thrown his shield aside, for he did not like
shields, considering them, as a rule, useless encumbrances, but
he had used them before when the Waziri had fought other
native tribes, and knowing that they were constructed as a
defence against the very weapons that his opponents were
using he retained his and advanced with the others toward
the white line. He had determined that their only hope lay in
accounting for as many of their adversaries in the first clash
of arms as was possible, and this word he had passed down
the line with the further admonition that the instant that a
man had disposed of an antagonist he turn immediately to
help the red nearest him, or the one most sorely beset.</p>

<p>As the two lines drew closer, each man selected the opponent
opposite him and Tarzan found that he faced a black
warrior from the outer villages. They came closer. Some of
the men, more eager or nervous than the others, were in
advance; some, more fearful, lagged behind. Tarzan's opponent
came upon him. Already pikes were flying through the air.
Tarzan and the black hurled their missiles at the same instant,
and back of the ape-man's throw was all the skill and all the
muscle and all the weight that he could command. Tarzan
struck upward with his shield and his opponent's pike struck
it a glancing blow, but with such force that the spear haft
was shattered, while Tarzan's weapon passed through the
shield of his opponent and pierced the fellow's heart.</p>

<p>There were two others down&mdash;one killed and one wounded&mdash;and
the Colosseum was a babble of voices and a bedlam of
noise. Tarzan sprang quickly to aid one of his fellows, but
another white, who had killed his red opponent, ran to interfere.
Tarzan's net annoyed him, so he threw it at a white who
was pressing one of the reds and took on his fresh opponent,
who had drawn his sword. His adversary was a professional
gladiator, a man trained in the use of all his weapons, and
Tarzan soon realized that only through great strength and
agility might he expect to hold his own with this opponent.</p>

<p>The fellow did not rush. He came in slowly and carefully,
feeling out Tarzan. He was cautious because he was an old
hand at the business and was imbued with but a single hope&mdash;to
live. He cared as little for the hoots and jibes of the people
as he did for their applause, and he hated Caesar. He soon
discovered that Tarzan was adopting defensive tactics only,
but whether this was for the purpose of feeling out his opponent
or whether it was part of a plan that would lead up to a
sudden and swift surprise, the gladiator could not guess, nor
did he care particularly, for he knew that he was master of
his weapon and many a corpse had been burned that in life
had thought to surprise him.</p>

<p>Judging Tarzan's skill with the sword by his skill with the
shield, the gladiator thought that he was pitted against a
highly skilled adversary, and he waited patiently for Tarzan
to open up his offence and reveal his style. But Tarzan had no
style that could be compared with that of the gladiator. What
he was awaiting was a lucky chance&mdash;the only thing that he
felt could assure him victory over this wary and highly skilled
swordsman&mdash;but the gladiator gave him no openings, and he
was hoping that one of his companions would be free to come
to his assistance, when suddenly and without warning a net
dropped over his shoulders from behind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Cassius Hasta</span> split the helmet of a burly thief who opposed
him, and as he turned to look for a new opponent he
saw a white cast a net over Tarzan's head and shoulders from
the rear, while the ape-man was engaged with a professional
gladiator. Cassius was nearer the gladiator than Tarzan's other
opponent and with a cry he hurled himself upon him. Tarzan
saw what Cassius Hasta had done and wheeled to face the
white who had attacked him from the rear.</p>

<p>The gladiator found Cassius Hasta a very different opponent
from Tarzan. Perhaps he was not as skilful with his shield.
Perhaps he was not as powerful, but never in all his experience
had the gladiator met such a swordsman.</p>

<p>The crowd had been watching Tarzan from the beginning
of the event because his great height and his nakedness and
his leopard-skin marked him from all others. They noted that
the first cast of his pike had split the shield of his opponent
and dropped him dead and they watched his encounter with
the gladiator, which did not please them at all. It was far too
slow and they hooted and voiced catcalls. When the white
cast the net over him they howled with delight, for they did
not know from one day to the next, or from one minute to
the next, what their own minds would be the next day or the
next minute. They were cruel and stupid, but they were no
different from the crowds of any place or any time.</p>

<p>As Tarzan, entangled in the net, turned to face the new
menace, the white leaped toward him to finish him with a
dagger and Tarzan caught the net with the fingers of both his
hands and tore it asunder as though it had been made of
paper, but the fellow was upon him in the same instant. The
dagger hand struck as Tarzan seized the dagger wrist. Blood
ran from beneath the leopard-skin from a wound over Tarzan's
heart, so close had he been to death, but his hand
stopped the other just in time and now steel fingers closed
upon that wrist until the man cried out with pain as he felt
his bones crushed together. The ape-man drew his antagonist
toward him and seized him by the throat and shook him as a
terrier shakes a rat, while the air trembled to the delighted
screams of the mob.</p>

<p>An instant later Tarzan cast the lifeless form aside, picked
up his sword and shield that he had been forced to abandon,
and sought for new foes. Thus the battle waged around the
arena, each side seeking to gain the advantage in numbers so
that they might set upon the remnant of their opponents and
destroy them. Cassius Hasta had disposed of the gladiator that
he had drawn away from Tarzan and was now engaged with
another swordsman when a second fell upon him. Two to one
are heavy odds, but Cassius Hasta tried to hold the second off
until another red could come to his assistance.</p>

<p>This, however, did not conform with the ideas of the whites
who were engaging him, and they fell upon him with re-doubled
fury to prevent the very thing that he hoped for. He
saw an opening and quick as lightning his sword leaped into it,
severing the jugular vein of one of his antagonists, but his
guard was down for the instant and a glancing blow struck
his helmet and, though it did not pierce it, it sent him stumbling
to the sand, half-stunned.</p>

<p>"<span class="it">Habet! Habet!</span>" cried the people, for Cassius Hasta had
fallen close to one side of the arena where a great number of
people could see him. Standing over him, his antagonist raised
his forefinger to the audience and every thumb went down.</p>

<p>With a smile the white raised his sword to drive it through
Hasta's throat, but as he paused an instant, facing the crowd,
in a little play to the galleries for effect, Tarzan leaped across
the soft sand, casting aside his sword and shield, reverting to
the primitive, to the beast, to save his friend.</p>

<p>It was like the charge of a lion. The crowd saw and was
frozen into silence. They saw him spring in his stride several
yards before he reached the opposing gladiator and, like a
jungle beast, fall upon the shoulders and back of his prey.</p>

<p>Down the two went across the body of Hasta, but instantly
the ape-man was upon his feet and in his hands was his antagonist.
He shook him as he had shaken the other&mdash;shook
him into unconsciousness, choking him as he shook, shook
him to death, and cast his body from him.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild. They stood upon their benches and
shrieked and waved scarves and helmets and threw many
flowers and sweetmeats into the arena. Tarzan stooped and
lifted Cassius Hasta to his feet as he saw that he was not
killed and consciousness was returning.</p>

<p>Scanning the arena quickly, he saw that fifteen reds survived
and but ten white. This was a battle for survival. There
were no rules and no ethics. It was your life or mine and
Tarzan gathered the surplus five and set upon the strongest
white, who now, surrounded by six swordsmen, went down to
death in an instant.</p>

<p>At Tarzan's command the six divided and each three
charged another white with the result that by following these
tactics the event was brought to a sudden and bloody close
with fifteen reds surviving and the last white slain.</p>

<p>The crowd was crying Tarzan's name above all others, but
Sublatus was enraged. The affront that had been put upon him
by this wild barbarian had not been avenged as he had hoped,
but instead Tarzan had achieved a personal popularity far
greater than his own. That it was ephemeral and subject to the
changes of the fickle public mind did not lessen the indignation
and chagrin of the Emperor. His mind could entertain
but one thought toward Tarzan. The creature must be destroyed.
He turned to the praefect in charge of the games
and whispered a command.</p>

<p>The crowd was loudly demanding that the laurel wreaths
be accorded the victors and that they be given their freedom,
but instead they were herded back to their enclosure, all but
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Perhaps, suggested some members of the audience,
Sublatus is going to honour him particularly, and this rumour
ran quickly through the crowd, as rumours will, until it
became a conviction.</p>

<p>Slaves came and dragged away the corpses of the slain and
picked up the discarded weapons and scattered new sand and
raked it, while Tarzan stood where he had been told to stand,
beneath the loge of Caesar.</p>

<p>He stood with folded arms, grimly waiting for what he
knew not, and then a low groan rose from the crowded
stands&mdash;a groan that grew in volume to loud cries of anger
above which Tarzan caught words that sounded like
"Tyrant!" "Coward!" "Traitor!" and "Down with
Sublatus!" He looked around and saw them pointing to the
opposite end of the arena and facing in that direction, he saw
the thing that had aroused their wrath, for instead of a laurel
wreath and freedom there stood eyeing him a great, black-maned
lion, gaunt with hunger.</p>

<p>Toward the anger of the populace Sublatus exhibited, outwardly,
an arrogant and indifferent mien. Contemptuously he
permitted his gaze to circle the stand, but he whispered orders
that sent three centuries of legionaries among the audience in
time to overawe a few agitators who would have led them
against the imperial loge.</p>

<p>But now the lion was advancing, and the cruel and selfish
audience forgot its momentary anger against injustice in the
expected thrill of another bloody encounter. Some who, a
moment before, had been loudly acclaiming Tarzan now
cheered the lion, though if the lion were vanquished they
would again cheer Tarzan. That, however, they did not
anticipate, but believed that they had taken sides with the
assured winner, since Tarzan was armed only with a dagger,
not having recovered his other weapons after he had thrown
them aside.</p>

<p>Naked but for loin-cloth and leopard-skin, Tarzan presented
a magnificent picture of physical perfection, and the people of
Castra Sanguinarius gave him their admiration, while they
placed their denarii and their talents upon the lion.</p>

<p>They had seen other men that week face other lions bravely
and hopelessly and they saw the same courageous bearing in
the giant barbarian, but the hopelessness they took for granted
the ape-man did not feel. With head flattened, half-crouching,
the lion moved slowly toward its prey, the tip of its tail
twitching in nervous anticipation, its gaunt sides greedy to be
filled. Tarzan waited.</p>

<p>Had he been the lion himself, he scarcely could have better
known what was passing in that savage brain. He knew the
instant when the final charge would start. He knew the speed
of that swift and deadly rush. He knew when and how the
lion would rear upon its hind legs to seize him with great
talons and mighty yellow fangs.</p>

<p>He saw the muscles tense. He saw the twitching tail quiet
for an instant. His folded arms dropped to his side. The
dagger remained in its sheath at his hip. He waited, crouching
almost imperceptibly, his weight upon the balls of his feet,
and then the lion charged.</p>

<p>Knowing how accurately the beast had timed its final rush,
measuring the distance to the fraction of a stride, even as a
hunter approaches a jump, the ape-man knew that the surest
way in which to gain the first advantage was to disconcert the
charging beast by doing that which he could least expect.</p>

<p>Numa the lion knows that his quarry usually does one of
two things&mdash;he either stands paralysed with terror or he turns
and flees. So seldom does he charge to meet Numa that the
lion never takes this possibility into consideration and it was,
therefore, this very thing that Tarzan did.</p>

<p>As the lion charged, the ape-man leaped to meet him, and
the crowd sat breathless and silent. Even Sublatus leaned
forward with parted lips, forgetful, for a moment, that he
was Caesar.</p>

<p>Numa tried to check himself and rear to meet this presumptuous
man-thing, but he slipped a little in the sand and
the great paw that struck at Tarzan was ill-timed and missed,
for the ape-man had dodged to one side and beneath it, and in
the fraction of a second that it took Numa to recover himself
he found that their positions had been reversed and that the
prey that he would have leaped upon had turned swiftly and
leaped upon him.</p>

<p>Full upon the back of the lion sprang Tarzan of the Apes.
A giant forearm encircled the maned throat; steel-thewed
legs crossed beneath the gaunt, slim belly and locked themselves
there. Numa reared and pawed and turned to bite the
savage beast upon his back, but the vice-like arm about his
throat pressed tighter, holding him so that his fangs could not
reach their goal. He leaped into the air and when he alighted
on the sand shook himself to dislodge the growing man-beast
clinging to him.</p>

<p>Holding his position with his legs and one arm, Tarzan,
with his free hand, sought the hilt of his dagger. Numa, feeling
the life being choked from him, became frantic. He reared
upon his hind legs and threw himself upon the ground, rolling
upon his antagonist, and now the crowd found its voice again
and shouted hoarse delight. Never in the history of the arena
had such a contest as this been witnessed. The barbarian was
offering such a defence as they had not thought possible and
they cheered him, though they knew that eventually the lion
would win. Then Tarzan found his dagger and drove the thin
blade into Numa's side, just back of his left elbow. Again
and again the knife struck home, but each blow seemed only
to increase the savage efforts of the lunging beast to shake the
man from his back and tear him to pieces.</p>

<p>Blood was mixed with the foam on Numa's jowls as he
stood panting upon trembling legs after a last futile effort to
dislodge the ape-man. He swayed dizzily. The knife struck
deep again. A great stream of blood gushed from the mouth
and nostrils of the dying beast. He lurched forward and fell
lifeless upon the crimsoned sand.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes leaped to his feet. The savage personal
combat, the blood, the contact with the mighty body of the
carnivore had stripped from him the last vestige of the thin
veneer of civilization. It was no lion hunter who stood there
with one foot upon his kill and through narrowed lids glared
about him at the roaring populace. It was no man, but a wild
beast, that raised its head and voiced the savage victory cry of
the bull ape, a cry that stilled the multitude and froze its
blood. But in an instant, the spell that had seized him passed.
His expression changed. The shadow of a smile crossed his
face as he stooped and, wiping the blood from his dagger upon
Numa's mane, returned the weapon to its sheath.</p>

<p>Caesar's jealousy had turned to terror as he realized the
meaning of the tremendous ovation the giant barbarian was
receiving from the people of Castra Sanguinarius. He well
knew, though he tried to conceal the fact, that he held no
place in popular favour and that Fastus, his son, was equally
hated and despised.</p>

<p>This barbarian was a friend of Maximus Praeclarus, whom
he had wronged, and Maximus Praeclarus, whose popularity
with the troops was second to none, was loved by Dilecta, the
daughter of Dion Splendidus, who might easily aspire to the
purple with the support of such a popular idol as Tarzan must
become if he were given his freedom in accordance with the
customs and rules governing the contests. While Tarzan waited
in the arena and the people cheered themselves hoarse, more
legionaries filed into the stands until the walls bristled with
glittering pikes.</p>

<p>Caesar whispered in consultation with the praefect of the
games. Trumpets blared and the praefect arose and raised his
open palm for silence. Gradually the din subsided and people
waited, listening, expecting the honours that were customarily
bestowed upon the outstanding hero of the games. The
praefect cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"This barbarian has furnished such extraordinary entertainment
that Caesar, as a special favour to his loyal subjects, has
decided to add one more event to the games in which the
barbarian may again demonstrate his supremacy. This event
will&mdash;&mdash;" but what further the praefect said was drowned in
a murmur of surprise, disapproval, and anger, for the people
had sensed by this time the vicious and unfair trick that
Sublatus was about to play upon their favourite.</p>

<p>They cared nothing for fair play, for though the individual
may prate of it at home it has no place in mob psychology,
but the mob knew what it wanted. It wanted to idolize a
popular hero. It did not care to see him fight again that day
and it wanted to thwart Sublatus, whom it hated. Menacing
were the cries and threats directed toward Caesar, and only
the glittering pikes kept the mob at bay.</p>

<p>In the arena the slaves were working rapidly; fallen Numa
had been dragged away, the sands swept and as the last slave
disappeared, leaving Tarzan again alone within the enclosure,
those menacing gates at the far end swung open once more.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">As</span>  Tarzan looked
toward the far end of the arena he saw six bull apes being herded
through the gateway. They had heard the victory cry roll
thunderously from the arena a few minutes before and they came
now from their cages filled with excitement and ferocity. Already
had they long been surly and irritable from confinement and from
the teasing and baiting to which they had been subjected by the
cruel Sanguinarians. Before them they saw a man-thing&mdash;a
hated Tarmangani. He represented the creatures that had captured
them and teased
them and hurt them.</p>

<p>"I am Gayat," growled one of the bull apes. "I kill."</p>

<p>"I am Zutho," bellowed another. "I kill."</p>

<p>"Kill the Tarmangani," barked Go-yad, as the six lumbered
forward&mdash;sometimes erect upon their hind feet, sometimes
swinging with gnarled knuckles to the ground.</p>

<p>The crowd hooted and groaned. "Down with Caesar!"
"Death to Sublatus!" rose distinctly above the tumult. To a
man they were upon their feet, but the glittering pikes held
them in awe as one or two, with more courage than brains,
sought to reach the loge of Caesar, but ended upon the pikes
of the legionaries instead. Their bodies, lying in the aisles,
served as a warning to the others.</p>

<p>Sublatus turned and whispered to a guest in the imperial
loge. "This should be a lesson to all who would dare affront
Caesar," he said.</p>

<p>"Quite right," replied the other. "Glorious Caesar is, indeed,
all powerful," but the fellow's lips were blue from terror as he
saw how great and menacing was the crowd and how slim and
few looked the glittering pikes that stood between it and the
imperial loge.</p>

<p>As the apes approached, Zutho was in the lead. "I am
Zutho," he cried. "I kill."</p>

<p>"Look well, Zutho, before you kill your friend," replied the
ape-man. "I am Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>Zutho stopped, bewildered. The others crowded about him.</p>

<p>"The Tarmangani spoke in the language of the great apes,"
said Zutho.</p>

<p>"I know him," said Go-yad. "He was king of the tribe when
I was a young ape."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, Whiteskin," said Gayat.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan. "I am Whiteskin. We are all prisoners
here together. These Tarmangani are my enemies and yours.
They wish us to fight, but we shall not."</p>

<p>"No," said Zutho, "we shall not fight against Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Good," said the ape-man, as they gathered close around
him, sniffing that their noses might validate the testimony of
their eyes.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" growled Sublatus. "Why do they
not attack him?"</p>

<p>"He has cast a spell upon them," replied Caesar's guest.</p>

<p>The people looked on wonderingly. They heard the beasts
and the man growling at one another. How could they guess
that they were speaking together in their common language?
They saw Tarzan turn and walk toward Caesar's loge, his
bronzed skin brushing against the black coats of the savage
beasts lumbering at his side. The ape-man and the apes halted
below imperial Caesar. Tarzan's eyes ran quickly around the
arena. The wall was lined with legionaries so not even Tarzan
might pass these unscathed. He looked up at Sublatus.</p>

<p>"Your plan has failed, Caesar. These that you thought would
tear me to pieces are my own people. They will not harm me.
If there are any others that you would turn against me let them
come now, but be quick, for my patience is growing short and
if I should say the word these apes will follow me into the
imperial loge and tear you to shreds."</p>

<p>And that is exactly what Tarzan would have done had he not
known that while he doubtless could have killed Sublatus his
end would come quickly beneath the pikes of the legionaries.
He was not sufficiently well versed in the ways of mobs to
know that in their present mood the people would have
swarmed to protect him and that the legionaries, with few
exceptions, would have joined forces with them against the
hated tyrant.</p>

<p>What Tarzan wanted particularly was to effect the escape of
Cassius Hasta and Caecilius Metellus simultaneously with his
own, so that he might have the advantage of their assistance in
his search for Erich von Harben in the Empire of the East;
therefore, when the praefect ordered him back to his dungeon
he went, taking the apes with him to their cages.</p>

<p>As the arena gates closed behind him he heard again, above
the roaring of the populace, the insistent demand: "Down
with Sublatus!"</p>

<p>As the jailer opened the cell door, Tarzan saw that its only
occupant was Maximus Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Tarzan!" cried the Roman. "I had not thought
to see you again. How is it that you are neither dead nor
free?"</p>

<p>"It is the justice of Caesar," replied Tarzan, with a smile,
"but at least our friends are free, for I see they are not here."</p>

<p>"Do not deceive yourself, barbarian," said the jailer. "Your
friends are chained safely in another cell."</p>

<p>"But they won their freedom," exclaimed Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And so did you," returned the jailer, with a grin; "but are
you free?"</p>

<p>"It is an outrage," cried Praeclarus. "It cannot be done."</p>

<p>"Think you that a poor soldier has the confidence of
Caesar?" asked the jailer; "but I have heard the reason
rumoured. Sedition is in the air. Caesar fears you and all your
friends because the people favour you and you favour Dion
Splendidus."</p>

<p>"I see," said Praeclarus, "and so we are to remain here
indefinitely."</p>

<p>"I should scarcely say indefinitely," grinned the jailer, as he
closed the door and locked it, leaving them alone.</p>

<p>"I did not like the look in his eye nor the tone of his voice,"
said Praeclarus, after the fellow was out of hearing. "The gods
are unkind, but how can I expect else from them when even
my best friend fails me?"</p>

<p>"You mean Appius Applosus?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"None other," replied Praeclarus. "If he had fetched the
keys, we might yet escape."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall in any event," said Tarzan, "I should
never give up hope until I were dead&mdash;and I have never been
dead."</p>

<p>"You do not know either the power or perfidy of Caesar,"
replied the Roman.</p>

<p>"Nor does Caesar know Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>Darkness had but just enveloped the city, blotting out even
the dim light of their dungeon-cell, when the two men perceived
wavering light beams lessening the darkness of the
corridor without. The light increased and they knew that
someone was approaching, lighting his way with a flaring
torch.</p>

<p>Visitors to the dungeon beneath the Colosseum were few in
the daytime. Guards and jailers passed occasionally and twice
each day slaves came with food, but at night the silent
approach of a single torch might more surely augur ill than
well. Praeclarus and Tarzan dropped the desultory conversation
with which they had been whiling away the time and
waited in silence for whoever might be coming.</p>

<p>Perhaps the night-time visitor was not for them, but the
egotism of misfortune naturally suggested that he was and
that his intentions might be more sinister than friendly. But
they had not long to wait and their suspicions precluded any
possibility of surprise when a man halted before the barred
gateway to their cell. As the visitor fitted the key to the lock
Praeclarus recognized him through the bars.</p>

<p>"Appius Applosus!" he cried. "You have come!"</p>

<p>"Ps-st!" cautioned Applosus, and quickly opening the gate
he stepped within and closed it silently behind him. With a
quick glance he surveyed the cell and then extinguished his
torch against the stone wall. "It is fortunate that you are
alone," he said, speaking in whispers, as he dropped to the
floor close to the two men.</p>

<p>"You are trembling," said Praeclarus. "What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"It is not what has happened, but what is about to happen
that alarms me," replied Applosus. "You have probably
wondered why I had not brought the keys. You have doubtless
thought me faithless, but the fact is that up to this instant it
has been impossible, although I have stood ready before to
risk my life in the attempt, even as I am now doing."</p>

<p>"But why should it be so difficult for the commander of the
Colosseum guard to visit the dungeon?"</p>

<p>"I am no longer the commander of the guards," replied
Applosus. "Something must have aroused Caesar's suspicions,
for I was removed in the hour that I last left you. Whether
someone overheard and reported our plan or whether it was
merely my known friendship for you that aroused his misgivings,
I may only surmise, but the fact remains that I have
been kept on duty constantly at the Porta Praetoria since I was
transferred there from the Colosseum. I have not even been
permitted to return to my home, the reason given being that
Caesar expects an uprising of the barbarians of the outer
villages, which, as we all know, is utterly ridiculous.</p>

<p>"I risked everything to leave my post only an hour ago, and
that because of a word of gossip that was passed to me by a
young officer, who came to relieve another at the gate."</p>

<p>"What said he?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"He said that an officer of the palace guard had told him
that he had been ordered to come to your cell tonight and
assassinate both you and this white barbarian. I hastened to
Festivitas and together we found the keys that I promised to
bring to you, but even as I slunk through the shadows of the
city's streets, endeavouring to reach the Colosseum unobserved
and unrecognized, I feared that I might be too late,
for Caesar's orders are that you are to be dispatched at once.
Here are the keys, Praeclarus. If I may do more,
command me."</p>

<p>"No, my friend," replied Praeclarus, "you have already
risked more than enough. Go at once. Return to your post lest
Caesar learn and destroy you."</p>

<p>"Farewell then and good luck," said Applosus. "If you would
leave the city, remember that Appius Applosus commands the
Porta Praetoria."</p>

<p>"I shall not forget, my friend," replied Praeclarus, "but I
shall not impose further risks upon your friendship."</p>

<p>Appius Applosus turned to leave the cell, but he stopped
suddenly at the gate. "It is too late," he whispered. "Look!"</p>

<p>The faint gleams of distant torch-light were cutting the
gloom of the corridor.</p>

<p>"They come!" whispered Praeclarus. "Make haste!" but
instead Appius Applosus stepped quickly to one side of the
doorway, out of sight of the corridor beyond, and drew his
Spanish sword.</p>

<p>Rapidly the torch swung down the corridor. The scraping of
sandals on stone could be distinctly heard, and the ape-man
knew that whoever came was alone. A man wrapped in a long
dark cloak halted before the barred door and, holding his
torch above his head, peered within.</p>

<p>"Maximus Preaclarus!" he whispered. "Are you within?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the other. "I was not sure that this was
the right cell."</p>

<p>"What is your errand?" demanded Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"I come from Caesar," said the other. "He sends a note."</p>

<p>"A sharp one?" inquired Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Sharp and pointed," laughed the officer.</p>

<p>"We are expecting you."</p>

<p>"You knew?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"We guessed, for we know Caesar."</p>

<p>"Then make peace with your gods," said the officer, drawing
his sword and pushing the door open, "for you are about
to die."</p>

<p>There was a cold smile upon his lips as he stepped across the
threshold, for Caesar knew his men and had chosen well the
proper type for this deed&mdash;a creature without conscience whose
envy and jealousy Praeclarus had aroused, and the smile was
still upon his lips as the sword of Appius Applosus crashed
through his helmet to his brain. As the man lunged forward
dead, the torch fell from his left hand and was extinguished
upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Now go," whispered Praeclarus to Applosus, "and may the
gratitude of those you have saved proved a guard against
disaster."</p>

<p>"It could not have turned out better," whispered Applosus.
"You have the keys, you have his weapons, and now you have
ample time to make your escape before the truth is learned.
Goodbye, again. Goodbye, and may the gods protect you."</p>

<p>As Applosus moved cautiously along the dark corridor,
Maximus Praeclarus fitted keys to their manacles and both
men stood erect, freed at last from their hated chains. No
need to formulate plans&mdash;they had talked and talked of
nothing else for weeks, changing them only to meet altered
conditions. Now their first concern was to find Hasta and
Metellus and the others upon whose loyalty they could depend
and to gather around them as many of the other prisoners as
might be willing to follow them in the daring adventure they
contemplated.</p>

<p>Through the darkness of the corridor they crept from cell to
cell and in the few that still held prisoners they found none
unwilling to pledge his loyalty to any cause or to any leader
that might offer freedom. Lukedi, Mpingu and Ogonyo were
among those they liberated. They had almost given up hope of
finding the others when they came upon Metellus and Hasta
in a cell close to the entrance to the arena. With them were a
number of professional gladiators, who should have been
liberated with the other victors at the end of the games, but
who were being kept because of some whim of Caesar that
they could not understand and that only inflamed them to
anger against the Emperor.</p>

<p>To a man they pledged themselves to follow wherever
Tarzan might lead.</p>

<p>"Few of us will come through alive," said the ape-man,
when they had all gathered in the large room that was reserved
for the contestants before they were ushered into the
arena, "but those who do will have been avenged upon Caesar
for the wrongs that he has done them."</p>

<p>"The others will be welcomed by the gods as heroes worthy
of every favour," added Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"We do not care whether your cause be right or wrong, or
whether we live or die," said a gladiator, "so long as there is
good fighting."</p>

<p>"There will be good fighting. I can promise you that," said
Tarzan, "and plenty of it."</p>

<p>"Then lead on," said the gladiator.</p>

<p>"But first I must liberate the rest of my friends," said the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"We have emptied every cell," said Praeclarus. "There are
no more."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my friend," said Tarzan. "There are still others&mdash;the
great apes."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">In</span> the dungeons of
Validus Augustus in Castrum Mare, Erich von Harben and Mallius
Lepus awaited the triumph of Validus Augustus and the opening of
the games upon the morrow.</p>

<p>"We have nothing to expect but death," said Lepus,
gloomily. "Our friends are in disfavour, or in prison, or in
exile. The jealousy of Validus Augustus against his nephew,
Cassius Hasta, has been invoked against us by Fulvus Fupus to
serve his own aims."</p>

<p>"And the fault is mine," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"Do not reproach yourself," replied his friend. "That
Favonia gave you her love cannot be held against you. It is
only the jealous and scheming mind of Fupus that is
to blame."</p>

<p>"My love has brought sorrow to Favonia and disaster to her
friends," said von Harben, "and here am I, chained to a stone
wall, unable to strike a blow in her defence or theirs."</p>

<p>"Ah, if Cassius Hasta were but here!" exclaimed Lepus.
"There is a man. With Fupus adopted by Caesar, the whole
city would arise against Validus Augustus if Cassius Hasta
were but here to lead us."</p>

<p>And as they conversed sadly and hopelessly in the dungeons
of Castrum Mare, noble guests gathered in the throne-room of
Sublatus in the city of Castra Sanguinarius, at the opposite end
of the valley. There were senators in rich robes and high
officers of the court and of the army, resplendent in jewels and
embroidered linen, who, with their wives and their daughters,
formed a gorgeous and glittering company in the pillared
chamber, for Fastus, the son of Caesar, was to wed the
daughter of Dion Splendidus that evening.</p>

<p>In the avenue, beyond the palace gates, a great crowd had
assembled&mdash;a multitude of people pushing and surging to and
fro, but pressing ever upon the gates up to the very pikes of the
legionaries. It was a noisy crowd&mdash;noisy with a deep-throated
roar of anger.</p>

<p>"Down with the tyrant!" "Death to Sublatus!" "Death to
Fastus!" was the burden of their hymn of hate.</p>

<p>The menacing notes filled the palace, reaching to the throne-room,
but the haughty patricians pretended not to hear the
voice of the cattle. Why should they fear? Had not Sublatus
distributed donations to all the troops that very day? Would
not the pikes of the legionaries protect the source of their
gratuity? It would serve the ungrateful populace right if
Sublatus set the legions upon them, for had he not given them
such a pageant and such a week of games as Castra
Sanguinarius never had known before?</p>

<p>For the rabble without, their contempt knew no bounds
now that they were within the palace of the Emperor, but
they did not speak among themselves of the fact that most of
them had entered by a back gate after the crowd had upset
the litter of a noble senator and spilled its passengers into
the dust of the avenue.</p>

<p>With pleasure they anticipated the banquet that would
follow the marriage ceremony, and while they laughed and
chattered over the gossip of the week, the bride sat stark and
cold in an upper chamber of the palace surrounded by her
female slaves and comforted by her mother.</p>

<p>"It shall not be," she said. "I shall never be the wife of
Fastus," and in the folds of her flowing robe she clutched the
hilt of a slim dagger.</p>

<p>In the corridor beneath the Colosseum, Tarzan marshalled
his forces. He summoned Lukedi and a chief of one of the
outer villages, who had been a fellow prisoner with him and
with whom he had fought shoulder to shoulder in the games.</p>

<p>"Go to the Porta Praetoria," he said, "and ask Appius
Applosus to pass you through the city wall as a favour to
Maximus Praeclarus. Go then among the villages and gather
warriors. Tell them that if they would be avenged upon
Caesar and free to live their own lives in their own way, they
must rise now and join the citizens who are ready to revolt
and destroy the tyrant. Hasten, there is no time to be lost.
Gather them quickly and lead them into the city by the Porta
Praetoria, straight to the palace of Caesar."</p>

<p>Warning their followers to silence, Tarzan and Maximus
Praeclarus led them in the direction of the barracks of the
Colosseum guard, where were quartered the men of Praeclarus's
own cohort.</p>

<p>It was a motley throng of near-naked black warriors from
the outer villages, black slaves from the city, and brown half-castes,
among whom were murderers, thieves and professional
gladiators. Praeclarus and Hasta and Metellus and Tarzan
led them, and swarming close to Tarzan were Gayat, Zutho
and Go-yad, and their three fellow apes.</p>

<p>Ogonyo was certain now that Tarzan was a demon, for
who else might command the hairy men of the woods?
Doubtless in each of these fierce bodies presided the ghost of
some great Bagego chief. If little Nkima had been the ghost
of his grandfather, then these must be the ghosts of very great
men indeed. Ogonyo did not press too closely to these savage
allies, nor as a matter of fact did any of the others&mdash;not even
the most ferocious of the gladiators.</p>

<p>At the barracks Maximus Praeclarus knew to whom to
speak and what to say, for mutiny had long been rife in the
ranks of the legionaries. Only their affection for some of their
officers, among whom was Praeclarus, had kept them thus
long in leash, and now they welcomed the opportunity to
follow the young patrician to the very gates of Caesar's
palace.</p>

<p>Following a plan that had been decided upon, Praeclarus
dispatched a detachment under an officer to the Porta Praetoria
with orders to take it by force, if they could not persuade
Appius Applosus to join them, and throw it open to
the warriors from the outer villages when they should arrive.</p>

<p>Along the broad Via Principalis, overhung by giant trees
that formed a tunnel of darkness in the night, Tarzan of the
Apes led his followers toward the palace in the wake of a few
torch-bearers, who lighted the way.</p>

<p>As they approached their goal, someone upon the outskirts
of the crowd, pressing the palace guard, was attracted by the
light of their torches and quickly the word was passed that
Caesar had sent for reinforcements&mdash;that more troops were
coming. The temper of the crowd, already inflamed, was not
improved as this news spread quickly through its ranks. A
few, following a self-appointed leader, moved forward menacingly
to meet the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" shouted one.</p>

<p>"It is I, Tarzan of the Apes," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>The shout that went up in response to this declaration
proved that the fickle populace had not, as yet, turned against
him.</p>

<p>Within the palace the cries of the people brought a scowl
to the face of Caesar and a sneer to many a patrician lip, but
their reaction might have been far different had they known
the cause of the elation of the mob.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" cried the voices. "What are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"We have come to rescue Dilecta from the arms of Fastus
and to drag the tyrant from the throne of Castra Sanguinarius."</p>

<p>Roars of approval greeted the announcement. "Death to
the tyrant!" "Down with the palace guards!" "Kill them!"
"Kill them!" rose from a thousand lips.</p>

<p>The crowd pushed forward. The officer of the guard, seeing
the reinforcements, among which were many legionaries,
ordered his men to fall back within the palace grounds and
close and bar the gate, nor did they succeed in accomplishing
this an instant too soon, for as the bolts were shot the crowd
hurled itself upon the stout barriers of iron and oak.</p>

<p>A pale-faced messenger hastened to the throne-room and
to Caesar's side.</p>

<p>"The people have risen," he whispered, hoarsely, "and
many soldiers and gladiators and slaves have joined them.
They are throwing themselves against the gates, which cannot
hold for long."</p>

<p>Caesar arose and paced nervously to and fro, and presently
he paused and summoned officers.</p>

<p>"Dispatch messengers to every gate and every barracks," he
ordered. "Summon the troops to the last man that may be
spared from the gates. Order them to fall upon the rabble
and kill. Let them kill until no citizen remains alive in the
streets of Castra Sanguinarius. Take no prisoners."</p>

<p>As word finds it way through a crowd, as though by some
strange telepathic means, so the knowledge soon became
common that Sublatus had ordered every legionary in the city
to the palace with instructions to destroy the revolutionaries
to the last man.</p>

<p>The people encouraged by the presence of the legionaries
led by Praeclarus, had renewed their assaults upon the gates,
and though many were piked through its bars, their bodies
were dragged away by their friends and others took their
places, so that the gates sagged and bent beneath their numbers:
yet they held and Tarzan saw that they might hold for
long&mdash;or at least long enough to permit the arrival of the
reinforcements that, if they remained loyal to Caesar, might
overcome this undisciplined mob with ease.</p>

<p>Gathering around him some of those he knew best, Tarzan
explained a new plan that was greeted with exclamations of
approval, and summoning the apes he moved down the dark
avenue, followed by Maximus Praeclarus, Cassius Hasta,
Caecilius Metellus, Mpingu, and a half dozen of Castra Sanguinarius's
most famous gladiators.</p>

<p>The wedding of Fastus and Dilecta was to take place upon
the steps of Caesar's throne. The high priest of the temple
stood facing the audience, and just below him, and at one
side, Fastus waited, while slowly up the centre of the long
chamber came the bride, followed by the vestal virgins, who
tended the temple's sacred fires.</p>

<p>Dilecta was pale, but she did not falter as she moved slowly
forward to her doom. There were many who whispered that
she looked the Empress already, so noble was her mien, so
stately her carriage. They could not see the slim dagger
clutched in her right hand beneath the flowing bridal robes.
Up the aisle she moved, but she did not halt before the priest
as Fastus had done&mdash;and as she should have done&mdash;but passed
him and mounting the first few steps toward the throne she
halted, facing Sublatus.</p>

<p>"The people of Castra Sanguinarius have been taught
through all the ages that they may look to Caesar for protection,"
she said. "Caesar not only makes the law&mdash;he is the
law. He is either the personification of justice or he is a
tyrant. Which, Sublatus, are you?"</p>

<p>Caesar flushed. "What mad whim is this, child?" he demanded.
"Who has set you to speak such words to Caesar?"</p>

<p>"I have not been prompted," replied the girl, wearily. "It is
my last hope and though I knew beforehand that it was futile,
I felt that I must not cast it aside as useless before putting it
to the test."</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" snapped Caesar. "Enough of this foolishness.
Take your place before the priest and repeat your
marriage vows."</p>

<p>"You cannot refuse me," cried the girl, stubbornly. "I appeal
to Caesar, which is my right as a citizen of Rome, the
mother city that we have never seen, but whose right to citizenship
has been handed down to us from our ancient sires.
Unless the spark of freedom is to be denied us, you cannot
refuse me that right, Sublatus."</p>

<p>The Emperor paled and then flushed with anger. "Come to
me tomorrow," he said. "You shall have whatever you wish."</p>

<p>"If you do not hear me now, there will be no tomorrow,"
she said. "I demand my rights now."</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Caesar, coldly, "what favour do you
seek?"</p>

<p>"I seek no favour," replied Dilecta. "I seek the right to
know if the thing for which I am paying this awful price has
been done, as it was promised."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Sublatus. "What proof
do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see Maximus Praeclarus here alive and free,"
replied the girl, "before I pledge my troth to Fastus. That, as
you well know, was the price of my promise to wed him."</p>

<p>Caesar arose angrily. "That cannot be," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it can be," cried a voice from the balcony at the
side of the chamber, "for Maximus Praeclarus stands just
behind me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Every</span> eye turned in the direction of the balcony from which
came the voice of the speaker. A gasp of astonishment arose
from the crowded room.</p>

<p>"The barbarian!" "Maximus Praedarus!" cried a score of
voices.</p>

<p>"The guard! The guard!" screamed Caesar, as Tarzan
leaped from the balcony to one of the tall pillars that supported
the roof and slid quickly to the floor, while behind him
came six hairy apes.</p>

<p>A dozen swords flashed from their scabbards as Tarzan and
the six leaped toward the throne. Women screamed and fainted.
Caesar shrank back upon his golden seat, momentarily
paralysed by terror.</p>

<p>A noble with bared blade leaped in front of Tarzan to bar
his way, but Go-yad sprang full upon him. Yellow fangs bit
once into his neck and, as the great ape arose and standing on
the body of his kill roared forth his victory cry, the other
nobles shrank back. Fastus, with a scream, turned and fled,
and Tarzan leaped to Dilecta's side. As the apes ascended the
steps to the dais, Caesar, jabbering with terror, scuttled from
his seat and hid, half-fainting, behind the great throne that
was the symbol of his majesty and his power.</p>

<p>But it was not long before the nobles and officers and soldiers
in the apartment regained the presence of mind that the
sudden advent of this horrid horde had scattered to the four
winds, and now, seeing only the wild barbarian and six unarmed
beasts threatening them, they pushed forward. Just
then a small door beneath the balcony from which Tarzan
had descended to the floor of the throne-room was pushed
open, giving entrance to Maximus Praeclarus, Cassius Hasta,
Caecilius Metellus, Mpingu, and the others who had accompanied
Tarzan over the palace wall beneath the shadows of
the great trees into which the ape-man and the apes had assisted
their less agile fellows.</p>

<p>As Caesar's defenders sprang forward they were met by
some of the best swords in Castra Sanguinarius, as in the
forefront of the fighting were the very gladiators whose exploits
they had cheered during the week. Tarzan passed
Dilecta to Mpingu, for he and Praeclarus must lend a hand
in the fighting.</p>

<p>Slowly, Dilecta's defenders fell back before the greater
number of nobles, soldiers and guardsmen who were summoned
from other parts of the palace. Back toward the little
door they fell, while shoulder to shoulder with the gladiators
and with Maximus Praeclarus and Hasta and Metellus, Tarzan
fought and the great apes spread consternation among
all because of their disposition to attack friend as well as foe.</p>

<p>And out upon the Via Principalis the crowd surged and the
great gates gave to a shrieking mob that poured into the
palace grounds, overwhelming the guards, trampling them&mdash;trampling
their own dead and their own living.</p>

<p>But the veteran legionaries who composed the palace guard
made a new stand at the entrance to the palace. Once more
they checked the undisciplined rabble, which had by now
grown to such proportions that the revolting troops, who had
joined them, were lost in their midst. The guard had dragged
an onager to the palace steps and were discharging stones into
the midst of the crowd, which continued to rush forward to
fall upon the pikes of the palace defenders.</p>

<p>In the distance trumpets sounded from the direction of the
Porta Decumana, and from the Porta Principalis Dextra came
the sound of advancing troops. At first those upon the outskirts
of the mob, who had heard these sounds, did not interpret
them correctly. They cheered and shouted. These cowards
that hang always upon the fringe of every crowd, letting
others take the risks and do the fighting for them, thought
that more troops had revolted and that the reinforcements
were for them. But their joy was short-lived, for the first
century that swung into the Via Principalis from the Porta
Decumana fell upon them with pike and sword until those
who were not slain escaped, screaming, in all directions.</p>

<p>Century after century came at the double. They cleared the
Via Principalis and fell upon the mob within the palace court
until the revolt dissolved into screaming individuals fleeing
through the darkness of the palace grounds, seeking any shelter
that they might find, while terrible legionaries pursued
them with flaming torches and bloody swords.</p>

<p>Back into the little room from which they had come fell
Tarzan and his followers. The doorway was small and it was
not difficult for a few men to hold it, but when they would
have retreated through the window they had entered and gone
back into the palace grounds to seek escape across the walls
in the shadows of the old trees, they saw the grounds swarming
with legionaries and realized that the back of the revolt
had been broken.</p>

<p>The anteroom in which they had taken refuge would barely
accommodate them all, but it offered probably the best refuge
they could have found in all the palace of Sublatus, for there
were but two openings in it&mdash;the single small doorway leading
into the throne-room and an even smaller window letting into
the palace gardens. The walls were all stone and proof against
any weapons at the disposal of the legionaries; yet if the uprising
had failed and the legionaries had not joined the people,
as they had expected, of what value was this temporary
sanctuary? The instant that hunger and thirst assailed them
this same room would become their prison cell and torture
chamber&mdash;and perhaps for many of them a vestibule to the
grave.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dilecta," cried Praeclarus, in the first moment that he
could seize to go to her side, "I have found you only to lose
you again. My rashness, perhaps, has brought you death."</p>

<p>"Your coming saved me from death," replied the girl, drawing
the dagger from her gown and exhibiting it to Praeclarus.
"I chose this as husband rather than Fastus," she said, "so if
I die now I have lived longer than I should have, had you not
come; and at least I die happy, for we shall die together."</p>

<p>"This is not time to be speaking of dying," said Tarzan.
"Did you think a few hours ago that you would ever be together
again? Well, here you are. Perhaps in a few more
hours everything will be changed and you will be laughing at
the fears you are now entertaining."</p>

<p>Some of the gladiators, who were standing near and had
overheard Tarzan's words, shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Any of us who gets out of this room alive," said one,
"will be burned at the stake, or fed to lions, or pulled apart
by wild buffalo. We are through, but it has been a good fight,
and I for one thank this great barbarian for this glorious
end."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged and turned away. "I am not dead yet,"
he said, "and not until I am dead is it time to think of it&mdash;and
then it will be too late."</p>

<p>Maximus Praeclarus laughed. "Perhaps you are right," he
said. "What do you suggest? If we stay here, we shall be slain,
so you must have some plan for getting us out."</p>

<p>"If we can discern no hope of advantage through our own
efforts," replied Tarzan, "we must look elsewhere and await
such favours of fortune as may come from without, either
through the intervention of our friends beyond the palace
grounds or from the carelessness of the enemy himself. I admit
that just at present our case appears desperate, but even
so I am not without hope; at least we may be cheered by the
realization that whatever turn events may take it must be for
the better, since nothing could be worse."</p>

<p>"I do not agree with you," said Metellus, pointing through
the window. "See, they are setting up a small ballista in the
garden. Presently our condition will be much worse than it
is now."</p>

<p>"The walls appear substantial," returned the ape-man. "Do
you think they can batter them down, Praeclarus?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," replied the Roman, "but every missile that
comes through the window must take its toll, as we are so
crowded here that all of us cannot get out of range."</p>

<p>The legionaries that had been summoned to the throne-room
had been held at the small doorway by a handful of
gladiators and the defenders had been able to close and bar
the stout oaken door. For a time there had been silence in the
throne-room and no attempt was made to gain entrance to
the room upon that side; while upon the garden side two or
three attempts to rush the window had been thwarted, and
now the legionaries held off while the small ballista was being
dragged into place and trained upon the palace wall.</p>

<p>Dilecta having been placed in an angle of the room where
she would be safest, Tarzan and his lieutenants watched the
operations of the legionaries in the garden.</p>

<p>"They do not seem to be aiming directly at the window,"
remarked Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"No," replied Praeclarus. "I rather think they intend
making a breach in the wall through which a sufficient number
of them can enter to overpower us."</p>

<p>"If we could rush the ballista and take it," mused Tarzan,
"we could make it rather hot for them. Let us hold ourselves
in readiness for that, if their missiles make it too hot for us in
here. We shall have some advantage if we anticipate their
assault by a sortie of our own."</p>

<p>A dull thud upon the door at the opposite end of the room
brought the startled attention of the defenders to that quarter.
The oak door sagged and the stone walls trembled to the
impact.</p>

<p>Cassius Hasta smiled wryly. "They have brought a ram,"
he said.</p>

<p>And now a heavy projectile shook the outer wall and a
piece of plaster crumbled to the floor upon the inside&mdash;the
ballista had come into action. Once again the heavy battering-ram
shivered the groaning timbers of the door and the inmates
of the room could hear the legionaries chanting the hymn of
the ram to the cadence of which they swung it back and
heaved forward.</p>

<p>The troops in the garden went about their duty with quiet,
military efficiency. Each time a stone from the ballista struck
the wall there was a shout, but there was nothing spontaneous
in the demonstration, which seemed as perfunctory as the
mechanical operation of the ancient war-engine that delivered
its missiles with almost clock-like regularity.</p>

<p>The greatest damage that the ballista appeared to be doing
was to the plaster on the inside of the wall, but the battering-ram
was slowly but surely shattering the door at the opposite
side of the room.</p>

<p>"Look," said Metellus, "they are altering the line of the
ballista. They have discovered that they can effect nothing
against the wall."</p>

<p>"They are aiming at the window," said Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"Those of you who are in line with the window lie down
upon the floor," commanded Tarzan. "Quickly! the hammer
is falling upon the trigger."</p>

<p>The next missile struck one side of the window, carrying
away a piece of the stone, and this time the result was followed
by an enthusiastic shout from the legionaries in the
garden.</p>

<p>"That's what they should have done in the beginning," commented
Hasta. "If they get the walls started at the edge of the
window, they can make a breach more quickly there than
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"That is evidently what they are planning on doing," said
Metellus, as a second missile struck in the same place and a
large fragment of the wall crumbled.</p>

<p>"Look to the door," shouted Tarzan, as the weakened timbers
sagged to the impact of the ram.</p>

<p>A dozen swordsmen stood ready and waiting to receive the
legionaries, whose rush they expected the instant that the
door fell. At one side of the room the six apes crouched,
growling, and kept in leash only by the repeated assurances of
Tarzan that the man-things in the room with them were the
friends of the ape-man.</p>

<p>As the door crashed, there was a momentary silence, as each
side paused to see what the other would do, and in the lull
that ensued there came through the air a roaring sound,
ominous and threatening, and then the shouts of the legionaries
in the throne-room and the legionaries in the garden
drowned all other sounds.</p>

<p>The gap around the window had been enlarged. The missiles
of the ballista had crumbled the wall from the ceiling to
the floor, and as though in accordance with a pre-arranged
plan the legionaries assaulted simultaneously, one group rushing
the doorway from the throne-room, the other the breach
in the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned toward the apes and pointing in the direction
of the breached wall, shouted: "Stop them, Zutho! Kill,
Go-yad! Kill!"</p>

<p>The men near him looked at him in surprise and perhaps
they shuddered a little as they heard the growling voice of a
beast issue from the throat of the giant barbarian, but instantly
they realized he was speaking to his hairy fellows, as
they saw the apes spring forward with bared fangs and,
growling hideously, throw themselves upon the first legionaries
to reach the window. Two apes went down, pierced by
Roman pikes, but before the beastly rage of the others
Caesar's soldiers fell back.</p>

<p>"After them," cried Tarzan to Praeclarus. "Follow them
into the garden, capture the ballista and turn it upon the
legionaries. We will hold the throne-room door until you have
seized the ballista, then we shall fall back upon you."</p>

<p>After the battling apes rushed the three patricians, Maximus
Praeclarus, Cassius Hasta, and Caecilius Metellus, leading
gladiators, thieves, murderers, and slaves into the garden,
profiting by the temporary advantage the apes had gained for
them.</p>

<p>Side by side with the remaining gladiators Tarzan fought
to hold the legionaries back from the little doorway until the
balance of his party had won safely to the garden and seized
the ballista. Glancing back he saw Mpingu leading Dilecta
from the room in the rear of the escaped prisoners. Then he
turned again to the defence of the doorway, which his little
party held stubbornly until Tarzan saw the ballista in the
hands of his own men, and, giving step by step across the
room, he and they backed through the breach in the wall.</p>

<p>At a shout of command from Praeclarus, they leaped to
one side. The hammer fell upon the trigger of the ballista,
which Praeclarus had lined upon the window, and a heavy
rock drove into the faces of the legionaries.</p>

<p>For a moment the fates had been kind to Tarzan and his
fellows, but it soon became apparent that they were little if
any better off here than in the room they had just quitted, for
in the garden they were ringed by legionaries. Pikes were flying
through the air, and though the ballista and their own
good swords were keeping the enemy at a respectful distance,
there was none among them who believed that they could for
long withstand the superior numbers and the better equipment
of their adversaries.</p>

<p>There came a pause in the fighting, which must necessarily
be the case in hand-to-hand encounters, and as though by
tacit agreement each side rested. The three whites watched
the enemy closely. "They are preparing for a concerted attack
with pikes," said Praeclarus.</p>

<p>"That will write finis to our earthly endeavours," remarked
Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"May the gods receive us with rejoicing," said Caecilius
Metellus.</p>

<p>"I think the gods prefer them to us," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"Because they have taken so many more of them to heaven
this night," replied the ape-man, pointing at the corpses lying
about the garden, and Cassius Hasta smiled, appreciatively.</p>

<p>"They will charge in another moment," said Maximus Praeclarus,
and turning to Dilecta he took her in his arms and
kissed her. "Goodbye, dear heart," he said. "How fleeting is
happiness! How futile the hopes of mortal man!"</p>

<p>"Not goodbye, Praeclarus," replied the girl, "for where you
go I shall go," and she showed him the slim dagger in her
hand.</p>

<p>"No," cried the man. "Promise me that you will not do
that."</p>

<p>"And why not? Is not death sweeter than Fastus?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," he said, sadly.</p>

<p>"They come," cried Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>"Ready!" shouted Tarzan. "Give them all we have. Death
is better than the dungeons of the Colosseum."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">From</span> the far end of the garden, above the din of breaking
battle, rose a savage cry&mdash;a new note that attracted the
startled attention of the contestants upon both sides. Tarzan's
head snapped to attention. His nostrils sniffed the air. Recognition,
hope, surprise, incredulity surged through his consciousness
as he stood there with flashing eyes looking out
over the heads of his adversaries.</p>

<p>In increasing volume the savage roar rolled into the garden
of Caesar. The legionaries turned to face the vanguard of an
army led by a horde of ebon warriors, glistening giants from
whose proud heads floated white feather war-bonnets and
from whose throats issued the savage war-cry that had filled
the heart of Tarzan&mdash;the Waziri had come.</p>

<p>At their head Tarzan saw Muviro and with him was Lukedi,
but what the ape-man did not see, and what none of those in
the garden of Caesar saw until later, was the horde of warriors
from the outer villages of Castra Sanguinarius that, following
the Waziri into the city, were already over-running the palace
seeking the vengeance that had so long been denied them.</p>

<p>As the last of the legionaries in the garden threw down
their arms and begged Tarzan's protection, Muviro ran to the
ape-man and, kneeling at his feet, kissed his hand, and at the
same instant a little monkey dropped from an overhanging
tree on to Tarzan's shoulder.</p>

<p>"The gods of our ancestors have been good to the Waziri,"
said Muviro, "otherwise we should have been too late."</p>

<p>"I was puzzled as to how you found me," said Tarzan,
"until I saw Nkima."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Nkima," said Muviro. "He came back to the
country of the Waziri, to the land of Tarzan, and led us here.
Many times we would have turned back thinking that he was
mad, but he urged us on and we followed him, and now the
big Bwana can come back with us to the home of his own
people."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan, shaking his head. "I cannot come yet.
The son of my good friend is still in this valley, but you are
just in time to help me to rescue him, nor is there any time
to lose."</p>

<p>Legionaries, throwing down their arms, were running from
the palace, from which came the shrieks and groans of the
dying and the savage hoots and cries of the avenging horde.
Praeclarus stepped to Tarzan's side.</p>

<p>"The barbarians of the outer villages are attacking the city,
murdering all who fall into their hands," he cried. "We must
gather what men we can and make a stand against them. Will
these blacks, who have just come, fight with us against them?"</p>

<p>"They will fight as I direct," replied Tarzan, "but I think it
will not be necessary to make war upon the barbarians. Lukedi,
where are the white officers who command the barbarians?"</p>

<p>"Once they neared the palace," replied Lukedi, "the warriors
became so excited that they broke away from their white
leaders and followed their own chieftain."</p>

<p>"Go and fetch their greatest chief," directed Tarzan.</p>

<p>During the half hour that followed, Tarzan and his lieutenants
were busy reorganizing their forces into which were
incorporated the legionaries who had surrendered to them, in
caring for the wounded, and planning for the future. From
the palace came the hoarse cries of the looting blacks, and
Tarzan had about abandoned hope that Lukedi would be able
to persuade a chief to come to him when Lukedi returned,
accompanied by two warriors from the outer villages, whose
bearing and ornaments proclaimed them chieftains.</p>

<p>"You are the man called Tarzan?" demanded one of the
chiefs.</p>

<p>The ape-man nodded. "I am," he said.</p>

<p>"We have been looking for you. This Bagego said that you
have promised that no more shall our people be taken into
slavery and no longer shall our warriors be condemned to the
arena. How can you who are yourself a barbarian, guarantee
this to us?"</p>

<p>"I cannot guarantee it, you have the power to enforce it
yourself," replied the ape-man, "and I with my Waziri will aid
you, but now you must gather your warriors. Let no one be
killed from now on who does not oppose you. Gather your
warriors and take them into the avenue before the palace and
then come with your subjects to the throne-room of Caesar.
There we shall demand and receive justice, not for the
moment but for all time. Go!"</p>

<p>Eventually the looting horde of blacks was quieted by their
chiefs and withdrawn to the Via Principalis. Waziri warriors
manned the shattered gate of Caesar's palace and lined the
corridor to the throne-room and the aisle to the foot of the
throne. They formed a half circle about the throne itself, and
upon the throne of Caesar sat Tarzan of the Apes with
Praeclarus and Dilecta and Cassius Hasta and Caecilius
Metellus and Muviro about him, while little Nkima sat upon
his shoulder and complained bitterly, for Nkima, as usual, was
frightened and cold and hungry.</p>

<p>"Send legionaries to fetch Sublatus and Fastus," Tarzan
directed Praeclarus, "for this business must be attended to
quickly, as within the hour I march on Castrum Mare."</p>

<p>Flushed with excitement, the legionaries that had been sent
to fetch Sublatus and Fastus rushed into the throne-room.
"Sublatus is dead!" they cried. "Fastus is dead! The barbarians
have slain them. The chambers and corridors above
are filled with the bodies of senators, nobles, and officers of
the legion."</p>

<p>"Are none left alive?" demanded Praeclarus, paling.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied one of the legionaries, "there were many
barricaded in another apartment who withstood the onslaught
of the blacks. We explained to them that they are now safe
and they are coming to the throne-room," and up the aisle
marched the remnants of the wedding guests, the sweat and
blood upon the men evidencing the dire straits from which
they had been delivered, the women still nervous and
hysterical. Leading them came Dion Splendidus, and at sight
of him Dilecta gave a cry of relief and pleasure and ran down
the steps of the throne and along the aisle to meet him.</p>

<p>Tarzan's face lighted with relief when he saw the old
senator, for his weeks in the home of Festivitas and his long
incarceration with Maximus Praeclarus in the dungeons of the
Colosseum had familiarized him with the politics of Castra
Sanguinarius, and now the presence of Dion Splendidus was
all that he needed to complete the plans that the tyranny and
cruelty of Sublatus had forced upon him.</p>

<p>He rose from the throne and raised his hand for silence.
The hum of voices ceased. "Caesar is dead, but upon some one
of you must fall the mantle of Caesar."</p>

<p>"Long live Tarzan! Long live the new Caesar!" cried one of
the gladiators, and instantly every Sanguinaran in the room
took up the cry.</p>

<p>The ape-man smiled and shook his head. "No," he said,
"not I, but there is one here to whom I offer the imperial
diadem upon the condition that he fulfils the promises I have
made to the barbarians of the outer villages.</p>

<p>"Dion Splendidus, will you accept the imperial purple with
the understanding that the men of the outer villages shall be
for ever free; that no longer shall their girls or their boys be
pressed into slavery, or their warriors forced to do battle in
the arena?" Dion Splendidus bowed his head in assent&mdash;and
thus did Tarzan refuse the diadem and create a Caesar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">The</span> yearly triumph of Validus Augustus, Emperor of the
East, had been a poor thing by comparison with that of
Sublatus of Castra Sanguinarius, though dignity and interest
was lent the occasion by the presence of the much-advertised
barbarian chieftain, who strode in chains behind Caesar's
chariot.</p>

<p>The vain show of imperial power pleased Validus Augustus,
deceived perhaps the more ignorant of his subjects, and
would have given Erich von Harben cause for laughter had he
not realized the seriousness of his position.</p>

<p>No captive chained to the chariot of the greatest Caesar
that ever lived had faced a more hopeless situation than he.
What though he knew that a regiment of marines or a
squadron of cavalry might have reduced this entire empire to
vassalage? What though he knew that the mayor of many a
modern city could have commanded a fighting force far
greater and much more effective than this little Caesar? The
knowledge was only tantalizing, for the fact remained that
Validus Augustus was supreme here and there was neither
regiment of marines nor squadron of cavalry to question his
behaviour toward the subject of a great republic that could
have swallowed his entire empire without being conscious of
any discomfort. The triumph was over. Von Harben had been
returned to the cell that he occupied with Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"You are back early," said Lepus. "How did the triumph of
Validus impress you?"</p>

<p>"It was not much of a show, if I may judge by the amount
of enthusiasm displayed by the people."</p>

<p>"The triumphs of Validus are always poor things," said
Lepus. "He would rather put ten talents in his belly or on his
back than spend one denarius to amuse the people."</p>

<p>"And the games," asked von Harben, "will they be as
poor?"</p>

<p>"They do not amount to much," said Lepus. "We have few
criminals here and as we have to purchase all our slaves, they
are too valuable to waste in this way. Many of the contests
are between wild beasts, an occasional thief or murderer may
be pitted against a gladiator, but for the most part Validus
depends upon professional gladiators and political prisoners&mdash;enemies
or supposed enemies of Caesar. More often they are
like you and I&mdash;victims of the lying and jealous intrigues of
favourites. There are about twenty such in the dungeons now,
and they will furnish the most interesting entertainment of
the games."</p>

<p>"And if we are victorious, we are freed?" asked von
Harben.</p>

<p>"We shall not be victorious," said Mallius Lepus. "Fulvus
Fupus has seen to that, you may rest assured."</p>

<p>"It is terrible," muttered von Harben. "I am thinking of
Favonia."</p>

<p>"And well you may," said Mallius Lepus. "My sweet cousin
would be happier dead than married to Fulvus Fupus."</p>

<p>"I feel so helpless," said von Harben. "Not a friend, not
even my faithful body-servant, Gabula."</p>

<p>"Oh, that reminds me," exclaimed Lepus. "They were here
looking for him this morning."</p>

<p>"Looking for him? Is he not confined in the dungeon?"</p>

<p>"He was, but he was detailed with other prisoners to prepare
the arena last night, and during the darkness of early morning
he is supposed to have escaped&mdash;but be that as it may, they
were looking for him."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed von Harben. "I shall feel better just
knowing that he is at large, though there is nothing that he
can do for me. Where could he have gone?"</p>

<p>"Castrum Mare is ill guarded along its water-front, but the
lake itself and the crocodiles form a barrier as efficacious as
many legionaries. Gabula may have scaled the wall, but the
chances are that he is hiding within the city, protected by other
slaves or, possibly, by Septimus Favonius himself."</p>

<p>"I wish I might feel that the poor, faithful fellow had been
able to escape the country and return to his own people," said
von Harben.</p>

<p>Mallius Lepus shook his head. "That is impossible," he said.
"Though you came down over the cliff, he could not return
that way, and even if he could find the pass to the outer
world, he would fall into the hands of the soldiers of Castra
Sanguinarius or the black barbarians of their outer villages.
No, there is no chance that Gabula will escape."</p>

<p>The time passed quickly, all too quickly, between the hour
that Erich von Harben was returned to his cell, following his
exhibition in the triumph of Validus Augustus, and the coming
of the Colosseum guards to drive them into the arena.</p>

<p>The Colosseum was packed. The loges of the patricians were
filled. The haughty Caesar of the East sat upon an ornate
throne, shaded by a canopy of purple linen. Septimus Favonius
sat with bowed head in his loge and with him was his wife and
Favonia. The girl sat with staring eyes fixed upon the gateway
from which the contestants were emerging. She saw her cousin,
Mallius Lepus, emerge and with him Erich von Harben, and
she shuddered and closed her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>When she opened them again the column was forming and
the contestants were marching across the white sands to receive
the commands of Caesar. With Mallius Lepus and von Harben
marched the twenty political prisoners, all of whom were of
the patrician class. Then came the professional gladiators&mdash;coarse,
brutal men, whose business it was to kill or be killed.
Leading these, with a bold swagger, was one who had been
champion gladiator of Castrum Mare for five years. If the
people had an idol, it was he. They roared their approval of
him. "Claudius Taurus! Claudius Taurus!" rose above a babel
of voices. A few mean thieves, some frightened slaves, and a
half dozen lions completed the victims that were to make a
Roman holiday.</p>

<p>Erich von Harben had often been fascinated by the stories
of the games of ancient Rome. Often had he pictured the
Colosseum packed with its thousands and the contestants upon
the white sand of the arena, but now he realized that they had
been but pictures&mdash;but the photographs of his imagination.
The people in those dreams had been but picture people&mdash;automatons,
who move only when we look at them. When
there had been action on the sand the audience had been a
silent etching, and when the audience had roared and turned
its thumbs down the actors had been mute and motionless.</p>

<p>How different, this! He saw the constant motion in the
packed stands, the mosaic of a thousand daubs of colour that
became kaleidoscopic with every move of the multitude. He
heard the hum of voices and sensed the offensive odour of
many human bodies. He saw the hawkers and vendors passing
along the aisles shouting their wares. He saw the legionaries
stationed everywhere. He saw the rich in their canopied loges
and the poor in the hot sun of the cheap seats.</p>

<p>Sweat was trickling down the back of the neck of the
patrician marching just in front of him. He glanced at Claudius
Taurus. He saw that his tunic was faded and that his hairy
legs were dirty. He had always thought of gladiators as clean-limbed
and resplendent. Claudius Taurus shocked him.</p>

<p>As they formed in solid rank before the loge of Caesar,
von Harben smelted the black men pressing close behind him.
The air was hot and oppressive. The whole thing was disgusting.
There was no grandeur in it, no dignity. He wondered
if it had been like this in Rome.</p>

<p>And then he looked up into the loge of Caesar. He saw the
man in gorgeous robes, sitting upon his carved throne. He saw
naked blacks swaying long-handled fans of feathers above the
head of Caesar. He saw large men in gorgeous tunics and
cuirasses of shining gold. He saw the wealth and pomp and
circumstance of power, and something told him that after all
ancient Rome had probably been much as this was&mdash;that its
populace had smelled and that its gladiators had had hairy
legs with dirt on them and that its patricians had sweated
behind the ears.</p>

<p>Perhaps Validus Augustus was as great a Caesar as any of
them, for did he not rule half of his known world? Few of
them had done more than this.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered along the row of loges. The praefect of
the games was speaking and von Harben heard his voice, but
the words did not reach his brain, for his eyes had suddenly
met those of a girl.</p>

<p>He saw the anguish and hopeless horror in her face, and he
tried to smile as he looked at her, a smile of encouragement
and hope, but she only saw the beginning of the smile, for the
tears came and the image of the man she loved was only a dull
blur like the pain in her heart.</p>

<p>A movement in the stands behind the loges attracted von
Harben's eyes and he puckered his brows, straining his
faculties to assure himself that he must be mistaken, but he
was not. What he had seen was Gabula&mdash;he was moving
toward the imperial loge, where he disappeared behind the
hangings that formed the background of Caesar's throne.</p>

<p>Then the praefect ordered them from the arena and as von
Harben moved across the sand he tried to find some explanation
of Gabula's presence there&mdash;what errand had brought
him to so dangerous a place?</p>

<p>The contestants had traversed but half the width of the
arena returning to their cells when a sudden scream, ringing
out behind them, caused them all to turn. Von Harben saw
that the disturbance came from the imperial loge, but the
scene that met his startled gaze seemed too preposterous to
have greater substance than a dream. Perhaps it was all a
dream. Perhaps there was no Castrum Mare. Perhaps there
was no Validus Augustus. Perhaps there was no&mdash;ah, but that
could not be true, there was Favonia and this preposterous
thing then that he was looking at was true too. He saw a black
man holding Caesar by the throat with one hand and driving
a dagger into his heart with the other, and the black man
was Gabula.</p>

<p>It all happened so quickly and was over so quickly that
scarcely had Caesar's shriek run through the Colosseum than
he lay dead at the foot of his carved throne, and Gabula, the
assassin, in a single leap had cleared the arena wall and was
running across the sand toward von Harben.</p>

<p>"I have avenged you, Bwana!" cried the black man. "No
matter what they do to you, you are avenged."</p>

<p>A great groan arose from the audience and then a cheer as
someone shouted: "Caesar is dead!"</p>

<p>A hope flashed to the breast of von Harben. He turned and
grabbed Mallius Lepus by the arm. "Caesar is dead," he
whispered, "now is our chance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"In the confusion we can escape. We can hide in the city
and at night we can take Favonia with us and go away."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"God! I do not know," exclaimed von Harben, "but anywhere
would be better than here, for Fulvus Fupus is Caesar
and if we do not save Favonia tonight, it will be too late."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"Pass the word to the others," said von Harben. "The more
there are who try to escape the better chance there will be of
us to succeed."</p>

<p>The legionaries and their officers as well as the vast multitude
could attend only upon what was happening in the loge
of Caesar. So few of them had seen what really occurred there
that as yet there had been no pursuit of Gabula.</p>

<p>Mallius Lepus turned to the other prisoners. "The gods have
been good to us," he cried. "Caesar is dead and in the confusion
we can escape. Come!"</p>

<p>As Mallius Lepus started on a run toward the gateway that
led to the cells beneath the Colosseum, the shouting prisoners
fell in behind him. Only those of the professional gladiators
who were freemen held aloof, but they made no effort to
stop them.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" shouted Claudius Taurus, as von Harben
passed him. "Now if someone would kill Fulvus Fupus we
might have a Caesar who is Caesar."</p>

<p>The sudden rush of the escaping prisoners so confused and
upset the few guards beneath the Colosseum that they were
easily overpowered and a moment later the prisoners found
themselves in the streets of Castrum Mare.</p>

<p>"Where now?" cried one.</p>

<p>"We must scatter," said Mallius Lepus. "Each man for
himself."</p>

<p>"We shall stick together, Mallius Lepus," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"To the end," replied the Roman.</p>

<p>"And here is Gabula," said von Harben, as the black joined
them. "He shall come with us."</p>

<p>"We cannot desert the brave Gabula," said Mallius Lepus,
"but the first thing for us to do is to find a hiding-place."</p>

<p>"There is a low wall across the avenue," said von Harben,
"and there are trees beyond it."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said Mallius Lepus. "It is as good for now
as any other place."</p>

<p>The three men hurried across the avenue and scaled the low
wall, finding themselves in a garden so overgrown with weeds
and underbrush that they at once assumed that it was deserted.
Creeping through the weeds and forcing their way through the
underbrush, they came to the rear of a house. A broken door,
hanging by one hinge, windows from which the wooden
blinds had fallen, an accumulation of rubbish upon the
threshold marked the dilapidated structure as a deserted
house.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this is just the place for us to hide until night," said
von Harben.</p>

<p>"Its proximity to the Colosseum is its greatest advantage,"
said Mallius Lepus, "for they will be sure to believe that we
have rushed as far from our dungeon as we could. Let us
go in and investigate. We must be sure that the place is
uninhabited."</p>

<p>The rear room, which had been the kitchen, had a crumbling
brick oven in one corner, a bench and a dilapidated table.
Crossing the kitchen, they entered an apartment beyond and
saw that these two rooms constituted all that there was to the
house. The front room was large and as the blinds at the
windows facing the avenue had not fallen, it was dark within
it. In one corner they saw a ladder reaching to a trap-door in
the ceiling, which evidently led to the roof of the building, and
two or three feet below the ceiling and running entirely across
the end of the room where the ladder arose was a false ceiling
which formed a tiny loft just below the roof-beams, a place
utilized by former tenants as a storage-room. A more careful
examination of the room revealed nothing more than a pile of
filthy rags against one wall, the remains, perhaps, of some
homeless beggar's bed.</p>

<p>"It could not have been better," said Mallius Lepus, "if
this had been built for us. Why, we have three exits if we are
hard pressed&mdash;one into the back garden, one into the avenue
in front, and the third to the roof."</p>

<p>"We can remain in safety, then," said von Harben, "until
after dark, when it should be easy to make our way unseen
through the dark streets to the home of Septimus Favonius."</p>

<h2><a id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">East</span> along the via mare from Castra Sanguinarius marched
five thousand men. The white plumes of the Waziri nodded at
the back of Tarzan. Stalwart legionaries followed Maximus
Praeclarus, while the black warriors of the outer villages
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Sweating slaves dragged catapults, ballistae, testudones, huge
battering rams, and other ancient engines of war. There were
scaling ladders and wall hooks and devices for throwing fire
balls into the defences of an enemy. The heavy engines had
delayed the march and Tarzan had chafed at the delay, but he
had to listen to Maximus Praeclarus and Cassius Hasta and
Caecilius Metellus, all of whom had assured him that the fort,
which defended the only road to Castrum Mare, could not be
taken by assault without the aid of these mechanical engines
of war.</p>

<p>Along the hot and dusty Via Mare the Waziri swung, chanting
the war-songs of their people. The hardened legionaries,
their heavy helmets dangling against their breasts from cords
that passed about their necks, their packs on forked sticks
across their shoulders, their great oblong shields hanging in
their leather covers at their backs, cursed and grumbled as
became veterans, while the warriors from the outer villages
laughed and sang and chattered as might a party of
picnickers.</p>

<p>As they approached the fort with its moat and embankment
and palisade and towers, slaves were bearing the body of
Validus Augustus to his palace within the city, and Fulvus
Fupus, surrounded by fawning sycophants, was proclaiming
himself Caesar, though he trembled inwardly in contemplation
of what fate might lie before him&mdash;for though he was a fool
he knew that he was not popular and that many a noble
patrician with a strong following had a better right to the
imperial purple man he.</p>

<p>Throughout the city of Castrum Mare legionaries searched
for the escaped prisoners and especially for the black slave who
had struck down Validus Augustus, though they were handicapped
by the fact that no one had recognized Gabula, for
there were few in the city and certainly none in the entourage
of Caesar who was familiar with the face of the black from
distant Urambi.</p>

<p>A few of the thieves and five or six gladiators, who were
condemned felons and not freemen, had clung together in the
break for freedom, and presently they found themselves in
hiding in a low part of the city, in a den where wine could be
produced and where there were other forms of entertainment
for people of their class.</p>

<p>"What sort of a Caesar will this Fulvus Fupus make?"
one asked.</p>

<p>"He will be worse than Validus Augustus," said another.
"I have seen him in the Baths where I once worked. He is vain
and dull and ignorant; even the patricians hate him."</p>

<p>"They say he is going to marry the daughter of Septimus
Favonius."</p>

<p>"I saw her in the Colosseum today," said another. "I know
her well by sight, for she used to come to the shop of my
father and make purchases before I was sent to the dungeons."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to the house of Septimus Favonius?"
asked another.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said the youth. "Twice I took goods there for
her inspection, going through the forecourt and into the inner
garden. I know the place well."</p>

<p>"If one like her should happen to fall into the hands of a few
poor convicts they might win their freedom and a great
ransom," suggested a low-browed fellow with evil, cunning
eyes.</p>

<p>"And be drawn asunder by wild oxen for their pains."</p>

<p>"We must die anyway if we are caught."</p>

<p>"It is a good plan."</p>

<p>They drank again for several minutes in silence, evidencing
that the plan was milling in their minds.</p>

<p>"The new Caesar should pay an enormous ransom for his
bride."</p>

<p>The youth rose eagerly to his feet. "I will lead you to the
home of Septimus Favonius and guarantee that they will open
the gate for me and let me in, as I know what to say. All I
need is a bundle and I can tell the slave that it contains goods
that my father wishes Favonia to inspect."</p>

<p>"You are not such a fool as you look."</p>

<p>"No, and I shall have a large share of the ransom for my
part in it," said the youth.</p>

<p>"If there is any ransom, we shall share and share alike."</p>

<p>Night was falling as Tarzan's army halted before the
defences of Castrum Mare. Cassias Hasta, to whom the
reduction of the fort had been entrusted, disposed his forces
and supervised the placing of his various engines of war.</p>

<p>Within the city Erich von Harben and Mallius Lepus discussed
the details of their plans. It was the judgment of Lepus
to wait until after midnight before making any move to leave
their hiding-place.</p>

<p>"The streets will be deserted then," said Mallius Lepus,
"except for an occasional patrol upon the principal avenue,
and these may be easily eluded, since the torches that they
carry proclaim their approach long before there is any danger
of their apprehending us. I have the key to the gate of my
uncle's garden, which ensures that we may enter the grounds
silently and unobserved."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said von Harben, "but I dread the
long wait and the thought of further inaction seems
unbearable."</p>

<p>"Have patience, my friend," said Mallius Lepus. "Fulvus
Fupus will be too busy with his new Caesarship to give heed
to aught else for some time, and Favonia will be safe from
him, certainly for the next few hours at least."</p>

<p>And as they discussed the matter, a youth knocked upon
the door of the home of Septimus Favonius. Beneath the
shadow of the tree along the wall darker shadows crouched.
A slave bearing a lamp came to the door in answer to the
knocking and, speaking through a small grille, asked who was
without and what the nature of his business was.</p>

<p>"I am the son of Tabernarius," said the youth. "I have
brought fabrics from the shop of my father that the daughter
of Septimus Favonius may inspect them."</p>

<p>The slave hesitated.</p>

<p>"You must remember me," said the youth. "I have been
here often," and the slave held the light a little bit higher and
peered through the grille.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "your face is familiar. I will go and ask my
mistress if she wishes to see you. Wait here."</p>

<p>"These fabrics are valuable," said the youth, holding up a
bundle, which he carried under his arm. "Let me stand just
within the vestibule lest thieves set upon me and rob me."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the slave, and opening the gate he permitted
the youth to enter. "Remain here until I return."</p>

<p>As the slave disappeared into the interior of the house, the
son of Tabernarius turned quickly and withdrew the bolt that
secured the door. Opening it quickly he leaned out to voice a
low signal.</p>

<p>Instantly the denser shadows beneath the shadowy trees
moved and were resolved into the figures of men. Scurrying
like vermin, they hurried through the doorway and into the
home of Septimus Favonius, and into the anteroom off the
vestibule the son of Tabernarius hustled them. Then he closed
both doors and waited.</p>

<p>Presently the slave returned. "The daughter of Septimus
Favonius recalls having ordered no goods from Tabernarius,"
he said, "nor does she feel in any mood to inspect fabrics this
night. Return them to your father and tell him that when the
daughter of Septimus Favonius wishes to purchase she will
come herself to his shop."</p>

<p>Now this was not what the son of Tabernarius desired and
he racked his crafty brain for another plan, though to the
slave he appeared but a stupid youth, staring at the floor in
too much embarrassment even to take his departure.</p>

<p>"Come," said the slave, approaching the door and laying
hold of the bolt, "you must be going."</p>

<p>"Wait," whispered the youth, "I have a message for
Favonia. I did not wish anyone to know it and for that reason
I spoke of bringing fabrics as an excuse."</p>

<p>"Where is the message and from whom?" demanded the
slave, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It is for her ears only. Tell her this and she will know from
whom it is."</p>

<p>The slave hesitated.</p>

<p>"Fetch her here," said the youth. "It will be better that no
other member of the household sees me."</p>

<p>The slave shook his head. "I will tell her," he said, for he
knew that Mallius Lepus and Erich von Harben had escaped
from the Colosseum and he guessed that the message might be
from one of these. As he hastened back to his mistress the son
of Tabernarius smiled, for though he knew not enough of
Favonia to know from whom she might reasonably expect a
secret message, yet he knew there were few young women who
might not, at least hopefully, expect a clandestine communication.
He had not long to wait before the slave returned and
with him came Favonia. Her excitement was evident as she
hastened forward toward the youth.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she cried, "you have brought word from him."</p>

<p>The son of Tabernarius raised a forefinger to his lip to
caution her to silence. "No one must know that I am here,"
he whispered, "and no ears but yours may hear my message.
Send your slave away."</p>

<p>"You may go," said Favonia to the slave. "I will let the
young man out when he goes," and the slave, glad to be
dismissed, content to be relieved of responsibility, moved
silently away into the shadows of a corridor and thence into
the uncharted limbo into which pass slaves and other lesser
people when one has done with them.</p>

<p>"Tell me," cried the girl, "what word do you bring? Where
is he?"</p>

<p>"He is here," whispered the youth, pointing to the anteroom.</p>

<p>"Here?" exclaimed Favonia, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, here," said the youth. "Come," and he led her to the
door and as she approached it he seized her suddenly and,
clapping a hand over her mouth, dragged her into the dark
anteroom beyond.</p>

<p>Rough hands seized her quickly and she was gagged and
bound. She heard them converse in low whispers.</p>

<p>"We will separate here," said one. "Two of us will take her
to me place we have selected. One of you will have to leave
the note for Fulvus Fupus so the palace guards will find it.
The rest of you scatter and go by different routes to the
deserted house across from the Colosseum. Do you know the
place?"</p>

<p>"I know it well. Many is the night that I have slept there."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the first speaker, who seemed to be the
leader, "now be off. We have no time to waste."</p>

<p>"Wait," said the son of Tabernarius, "the division of the
ransom has not yet been decided. Without me you could have
done nothing. I should have at least half."</p>

<p>"Shut up or you will be lucky if you get anything," growled
the leader.</p>

<p>"A knife between his ribs would do him good," muttered
another.</p>

<p>"You will not give me what I asked?" demanded the youth.</p>

<p>"Shut up," said the leader. "Come along now, men," and
carrying Favonia, whom they wrapped in a soiled and ragged
cloak, they left the home of Septimus Favonius unobserved;
and as two men carried a heavy bundle through the dark
shadows beneath the shadowy trees the son of Tabernarius
started away in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>A youth in soiled and ragged tunic and rough sandals
approached the gates of Caesar's palace. A legionary challenged
him, holding him at a distance with the point of
his pike.</p>

<p>"What do you loitering by the palace of Caesar by night?"
demanded the legionary.</p>

<p>"I have a message for Caesar," replied the youth.</p>

<p>The legionary guffawed. "Will you come in or shall I send
Caesar out to you?" he demanded, ironically.</p>

<p>"You may take the message to him yourself, soldier," replied
the other, "and if you know what is good for you, you will
not delay."</p>

<p>The seriousness of the youth's voice finally compelled the
attention of the legionary. "Well," he demanded, "out with it.
What message have you for Caesar?"</p>

<p>"Hasten to him and tell him that the daughter of Septimus
Favonius has been abducted and that if he hastens he will
find her in the deserted house that stands upon the corner
opposite the chariot entrance to the Colosseum."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the legionary.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the youth. "Tomorrow, I shall come for
my reward," and he turned and sped away before the legionary
could detain him.</p>

<hr class="tbk">

<p>"At this rate midnight will never come," said von Harben.</p>

<p>Mallius Lepus laid a hand upon the shoulder of his friend.
"You are impatient, but remember that it will be safer for
Favonia, as well as for us, if we wait until after midnight, for
the streets now must be full of searchers. All afternoon we
have heard soldiers passing. It is a miracle that they have not
searched this place."</p>

<p>"Ps-st!" cautioned von Harben. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"It sounded like the creaking of the gate in front of the
house," said Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"They are coming," said von Harben.</p>

<p>The three men seized the swords with which they had armed
themselves, after they had rushed the Colosseum guard, and
following a plan they had already decided upon in the event
that searchers approached their hiding-place they scaled the
ladder and crept out upon the roof. Leaving the trap-door
pushed slightly to one side, they listened to the sounds that
were now coming from below, ready to take instant action
should there be any indication that the searchers might mount
the ladder to the roof.</p>

<p>Von Harben heard voices coming from below. "Well, we
made it," said one, "and no one saw us. Here come the others
now," and von Harben heard the gate creak again on its rusty
hinges; then the door of the house opened and he heard
several people enter.</p>

<p>"This is a good night's work," said one.</p>

<p>"Is she alive? I cannot hear her breathe."</p>

<p>"Take the gag from her mouth."</p>

<p>"And let her scream for help?"</p>

<p>"We can keep her quiet. She is worth nothing to us dead."</p>

<p>"All right, take it out."</p>

<p>"Listen, you, we will take the gag out of your mouth, but
if you scream it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>"I shall not scream," said a woman's voice in familiar tones
that set von Harben's heart to palpitating, though he knew
that it was nothing more than his imagination that suggested
the seeming familiarity.</p>

<p>"We shall not hurt you," said a man's voice, "if you keep
quiet and Caesar sends the ransom."</p>

<p>"And if he does not send it?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, your father, Septimus Favonius, will pay
the price we ask."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" muttered von Harben. "Did you hear that,
Lepus?"</p>

<p>"I heard," replied the Roman.</p>

<p>"Then come," whispered von Harben. "Come, Gabula,
Favonia is below."</p>

<p>Casting discretion to the wind, von Harben tore the trap
from the opening in the roof and dropped into the darkness
below, followed by Mallius Lepus and Gabula.</p>

<p>"Favonia!" he cried. "It is I. Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here," cried the girl.</p>

<p>Rushing blindly in the direction of her voice, von Harben
encountered one of the abductors. The fellow grappled with
him, while, terrified by fear that the legionaries were upon
them, the others bolted from the building. As they went they
left the door open and the light of a full moon dissipated the
darkness of the interior, revealing von Harben struggling with
a burly fellow who had seized the other's throat and was now
trying to draw his dagger from its sheath.</p>

<p>Instantly, Mallius Lepus and Gabula were upon him, and a
quick thrust of the former's sword put a definite period to the
earthly rascality of the criminal. Free from his antagonist,
von Harben leaped to his feet and ran to Favonia, where she
lay upon a pile of dirty rags, against the wall. Quickly he cut
her bonds and soon they had her story.</p>

<p>"If you are no worse for the fright," said Mallius Lepus,
"we may thank these scoundrels for simplifying our task, for
here we are ready to try for our escape a full three hours
earlier than we had hoped."</p>

<p>"Let us lose no time, then," said von Harben. "I shall not
breathe freely until I am across the wall."</p>

<p>"I believe we have little to fear now," said Mallius Lepus.
"The wall is poorly guarded. There are many places where we
can scale it, and I know a dozen places where we can find
boats that are used by the fishermen of the city. What lies
beyond is upon the knees of the gods."</p>

<p>Gabula, who had been standing in the doorway, closed the
door quickly and crossed to von Harben, "Lights are coming
down the avenue, Bwana," he said. "I think many men are
coming. Perhaps they are soldiers."</p>

<p>The four listened intently until they made out distinctly the
measured tread of marching men.</p>

<p>"Some more searchers," said Mallius Lepus. "When they
have passed on their way, it will be safe to depart."</p>

<p>The light from the torches of the legionaries approached
until it shone through the cracks in the wooden blinds, but it
did not pass on as they had expected. Mallius Lepus put an
eye to an opening in one of the blinds.</p>

<p>"They have halted in front of the house," he said. "A part
of them are turning the corner, but the rest are remaining."</p>

<p>They stood in silence for what seemed a long time, though
it was only a few minutes, and then they heard sounds coming
from the garden behind the house and the light of torches was
visible through the open kitchen door.</p>

<p>"We are surrounded," said Lepus. "They are coming in the
front way. They are going to search the house."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried Favonia.</p>

<p>"The roof is our only hope," whispered von Harben, but
even as he spoke the sound of sandalled feet was heard upon
the roof and the light of torches shone through the open trap.</p>

<p>"We are lost," said Mallius Lepus. "We cannot defeat an
entire century of legionaries."</p>

<p>"We can fight them, though," said von Harben.</p>

<p>"And risk Favonia's life uselessly?" said Lepus.</p>

<p>"You are right," said von Harben, sadly, and then, "wait,
I have a plan. Come, Favonia, quickly. Lie down here upon
the floor and I will cover you with these rags. There is no
reason why we should all be taken. Mallius Lepus, Gabula,
and I may not escape, but they will never guess that you are
here, and when they are gone you can easily make your way
to the guard-house in the Colosseum, where the officer in
charge will see that you are given protection and an escort to
your home."</p>

<p>"Let them take me," said the girl. "If you are to be
captured, let me be captured also."</p>

<p>"It will do no good," said von Harben. "They will only
separate us, and if you are found here with us it may bring
suspicion upon Septimus Favonius."</p>

<p>Without further argument she threw herself upon the floor,
resigned in the face of von Harben's argument, and he
covered her over with the rags that had been a beggar's bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">By</span> the time that Cassius Hasta had disposed his forces and
placed his engines of war before the defences of Castrum
Mare, he discovered that it was too dark to open his assault
that day, but he could carry out another plan that he had and
so he advanced toward the gate, accompanied by Tarzan,
Metellus, and Praeclarus and preceded by torch-bearers and a
legionary bearing a flag of truce.</p>

<p>Within the fort great excitement had reigned from the
moment that the advancing troops had been sighted. Word
had been sent to Fulvus Fupus and reinforcements had been
hurried to the fort. It was assumed by all that Sublatus had
inaugurated a new raid upon a larger scale than usual, but they
were ready to meet it, nor did they anticipate defeat. As the
officer commanding the defenders saw the party approaching
with a flag of truce, he demanded from a tower gate the nature
of their mission.</p>

<p>"I have two demands to make upon Validus Augustus," said
Cassius Hasta. "One is that he free Mallius Lepus and Erich
von Harben and the other is that he permit me to return to
Castrum Mare and enjoy the privileges of my station."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"I am Cassius Hasta. You should know me well."</p>

<p>"The gods are good!" cried the officer.</p>

<p>"Long live Cassius Hasta! Down with Fulvus Fupus!" cried
a hoarse chorus of rough voices.</p>

<p>Someone threw open the gates, and the officer, an old friend
of Cassius Hasta, rushed out and embraced him.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" demanded Cassius Hasta.
"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Validus Augustus is dead. He was assassinated at the
games today and Fulvus Fupus has assumed the title of Caesar.
You are indeed come in time. All Castrum Mare will welcome
you."</p>

<p>Along the Via Mare from the castle to the lake-shore and
across the pontoon bridge to the island marched the army of
the new Emperor of the East, while the news spread through
the city and crowds gathered and shrieked their welcome to
Cassius Hasta.</p>

<p>In a deserted house across the avenue from the Colosseum
three fugitives awaited the coming of the legionaries of Fulvus
Fupus. It was evident that the soldiers intended to take no
chances. They entirely surrounded the building and they
seemed to be in no hurry to enter.</p>

<p>Von Harben had had ample time to cover Favonia with the
rags, so that she was entirely concealed before the legionaries
entered simultaneously from the garden, the avenue, and the
roof, torch-bearers lighting their way.</p>

<p>"It is useless to resist," said Mallius Lepus to the officer
who accompanied the men in from the avenue. "We will return
to the dungeons peaceably."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," said the officer. "Where is the girl?"</p>

<p>"What girl?" demanded Mallius Lepus.</p>

<p>"The daughter of Septimus Favonius, of course."</p>

<p>"How should we know?" demanded von Harben.</p>

<p>"You abducted her and brought her here," replied the
officer. "Search the room," he commanded, and a moment
later a legionary uncovered Favonia and raised her to her feet.</p>

<p>The officer laughed as he ordered the three men disarmed.</p>

<p>"Wait," said von Harben. "What are you going to do with
the daughter of Septimus Favonius? Will you see that she has
a safe escort to her father's house?"</p>

<p>"I am taking my orders from Caesar," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"What has Caesar to do with this?" demanded von Harben.</p>

<p>"He has ordered us to bring Favonia to the palace and to
slay her abductors upon the spot."</p>

<p>"Then Caesar shall pay for us all with legionaries," cried
von Harben, and with his sword he fell upon the officer in
the doorway, while Gabula and Mallius Lepus, spurred by a
similar determination to sell their lives as dearly as possible,
rushed those who were descending the ladder and entering the
kitchen door. Taken by surprise and momentarily disconcerted
by the sudden and unexpected assault, the legionaries fell back.
The officer, who managed to elude von Harben's thrust,
escaped from the building and summoned a number of legionaries
who were armed with pikes.</p>

<p>"There are three men in that room," he said, "and a woman.
Kill the men, but be sure that the woman is not harmed."</p>

<p>In the avenue the officer saw people running; heard them
shouting. He saw them stop as they were questioned by some
of his legionaries, whom he had left in the avenue. He
had not given the final order for his pike-men to enter the
building because his curiosity had momentarily distracted his
attention. As he turned now, however, to order them in, his
attention was again distracted by a tumult of voices that rose
in great cheers and rolled up the avenue from the direction of
the bridge that connects the city with the Via Mare and the
fort. As he turned to look, he saw the flare of many torches
and now he heard the blare of trumpets and the thud of
marching feet.</p>

<p>What had happened? He had known, as had everyone in
Castrum Mare, that the forces of Sublatus were camped before
the fort, but he knew that there had been no battle and so this
could not be the army of Sublatus entering Castrum Mare,
but it was equally strange if the defenders of Castrum Mare
should be marching away from the fort while it was menaced
by an enemy army. He could not understand these things, nor
could he understand why the people were cheering.</p>

<p>As he stood there watching the approach of the marching
column, the shouts of the people took on form and he heard
the name of Cassius Hasta distinctly.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he demanded, shouting to the men
in the street.</p>

<p>"Cassius Hasta has returned at me head of a big army, and
Fulvus Fupus has already fled and is in hiding."</p>

<p>The shouted question and the equally loud reply were heard
by all within the room.</p>

<p>"We are saved," cried Mallius Lepus, "for Cassius Hasta
will harm no friend of Septimus Favonius. Aside now, you
fools, if you know when you are well off," and he advanced
to the doorway.</p>

<p>"Back, men," cried the officer. "Back to the avenue. Let no
hand be raised against Mallius Lepus or these other friends of
Cassius Hasta, Emperor of the East."</p>

<p>"Clearly this fellow knows which side his bread is buttered
on," commented von Harben with a grin.</p>

<p>Together Favonia, von Harben, Lepus, and Gabula stepped
from the deserted building into the avenue. Approaching them
they saw the head of a column of marching men; flaming
torches lighted the scene until it was almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>"There is Cassius Hasta," exclaimed Mallius Lepus. "It is
indeed he, but who are those with him?"</p>

<p>"They must be Sanguinarians," said Favonia. "But look, one
of them is garbed like a barbarian, and see the strange black
warriors with their white plumes that are marching behind
them."</p>

<p>"I have never seen the like in all my life," exclaimed Mallius
Lepus.</p>

<p>"Neither have I," said von Harben, "but I am sure that I
recognize them, for their fame is great and they answer the
description that I have heard a thousand times."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Favonia.</p>

<p>"The white giant is Tarzan of the Apes, and the black
warriors are his Waziri fighting men."</p>

<p>At the sight of the legionaries standing before the house,
Cassius Hasta halted the column.</p>

<p>"Where is the centurion in command of these troops?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"It is I, glorious Caesar," replied the officer, who had come
to arrest the abductors of Favonia.</p>

<p>"Does it happen that you are one of the detachments sent
out by Fulvus Fupus to search for Mallius Lepus and the
barbarian, von Harben?"</p>

<p>"We are here, Caesar," cried Mallius Lepus, while Favonia,
von Harben and Gabula followed behind him.</p>

<p>"May the gods be praised!" exclaimed Cassias Hasta, as he
embraced his old friend. "But where is the barbarian chieftain
from Germania, whose fame has reached even to Castra
Sanguinarius?"</p>

<p>"This is he," said Mallius Lepus. "This is Erich von
Harben."</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped nearer. "You are Erich von Harben?" he
asked in English.</p>

<p>"And you are Tarzan of the Apes, I know," returned von
Harben in the same language.</p>

<p>"You look every inch a Roman," said Tarzan with a smile.</p>

<p>"I feel every inch a barbarian, however," grinned von
Harben.</p>

<p>"Roman or barbarian, your father will be glad when I bring
you back to him."</p>

<p>"You came here in search of me, Tarzan of the Apes?"
demanded von Harben.</p>

<p>"And I seemed to have arrived just in time," said the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you?" exclaimed von Harben.</p>

<p>"Do not thank me, my friend," said the ape-man. "Thank
little Nkima!"</p>
