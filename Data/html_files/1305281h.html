<p>Production Notes and Introductory:</p>
<p>This work, which appeared in "Waugh's Australian Almanac" for
1860, was prepared by Leichhardt's good friend, Rev. W.B. Clarke
in 1859 from Leichhardt's actual journal. Clarke's introduction
provides context.</p>
<p>The first set of asterisks, for Leichhardt's entry of 20th
August, most probably refer to Emmeline Macarthur. At the end of
Leichhardt's entry of 24th August, initials M., H. and T. refer
almost certainly to John Mann, Hovenden Hely and Henry Turnbull,
participants in his abortive second expedition, which only
reached the Peak Range.</p>
<p>Added as an Appendix are two articles published in <i>The
Sydney Morning Herald</i> either side of the third expedition.
These articles are available on the National Library of
Australia's "Trove" website. The first is from Ludwig Leichhardt
to his friend Lt. Robert Lynd, telling of the events of the
second expedition.</p>
<p>The second item is a summary of the journal by Leichhardt for
the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>. It was published just after he
returned Sydney and less than two months before he departed on
his fateful final journey. In this article there are a few small
differences between the table here and the one which Rev. Clarke
supplied to Daniel Bunce for Bunce's book covering Leichhardt's
second expedition, <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1305271h.html">"Australasiatic
Reminiscences"</a>.</p>
<p>A second map of the Balonne region, which Leichhardt made at
Cecil Plains Station at the time of the first letter, is also
added at the end. This map was given to Henry Russell, owner of
Cecil Plains, as detailed in his <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1305181h.html">"Genesis of
Queensland"</a>, available on Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p>In the year 1847, after his return from the unsuccessful
expedition of the previous year to Peak Range, Leichhardt made a
short journey to the westward of Darling Downs, for the purpose
of connecting his own lines of previous exploration with the
country along the Maranoa, traversed by the late Sir T. L.
Mitchell, during his expedition to the head of the Victoria
River, in the 1846, and subsequently by Mr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>In the letters I addressed to the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>, in August 1858, and in the paper read before the
Royal Geographical Society of London, in the same year, on the
"Desert" in connection with the expeditions in search for
Leichhardt, I quoted certain passages from the following diary,
which is the only record of the expedition of 1847.</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, advisable, that the diary itself, which
has never before been published, should now see the light; for it
not only completes the history of Leichhardt's expeditions up to
the fatal one of 1848, but furnishes to the enquirer the
authority upon which I rested some of the conclusions respecting
certain matters involved in my discussion of Leichhardt's
fate.</p>
<p>The account of the expedition now published, begins at Mr.
Gogg's Station on the Downs, and terminates, in fact, on the
Maranoa; but the return route being different from the westward
route, the following pages give, in fact, the details of two
explorations.</p>
<p>The chart appended is a reduced copy of the original M.S.
chart given to me by Leichhardt on his return. Scale
one-ninth.</p>
<p>The country described is now, I believe, occupied; but the
diary gives the condition of it before occupation, and is, so
far, interesting to geographers.</p>
<p>There are two striking correspondences, under date of 27th
August, with notices in the "<i>Tropical Australia</i>" of
Mitchell, at page 152 and at page 379, which may merit remark.
Both L. and M. mention&mdash;the one a river, the other a large
creek, having "reedy waterholes"&mdash;bordered by <i>Acacia
pendula</i> (M.) or <i>long linear-leaved Acacia</i> (L.) Both
describe a double branch of this water. Mitchell's locality (26
deg. 42 min. 27 sec. S.[)] was not reached by Leichhardt (26 deg.
40 min. S.) till three days after he came upon the features he
describes; we see, therefore, how remarkably the character of the
rivers in Australia is persistent, and how nearly, by accurate
descriptions, their features may be recognized. Mitchell first
called attention to this fact, and we have here an undesigned
coincidence illustrative of it.</p>
<p>Again, Mitchell mentions on his return from the Victoria, that
on the Balonne, one of the "cheering" peculiarities of the scene
was "the <i>merry</i> notes of numerous birds," and we have
Leichhardt, stating&mdash;"I could not help remarking how
<i>cheerfully</i> the birds sing near these creeks; the Oreoica
(the ventriloquist), the Magpie, the little Flycatcher, and
several others made themselves incessantly heard."</p>
<p>There is also a general agreement between the two explorers
respecting the temperature of that region. Mitchell gives in many
instances a sunrise temperature so low as 19 deg. F. and 20 deg.
F., and Leichhardt, in September, mentions <i>ice</i>, and a
temperature of 24 deg. and 26 deg.</p>
<p>As evidencing, moreover, an additional proof of the general
extent of atmospherical influences over wide tracts in Australia,
(of which I gave several examples in the Notes on Kennedy's
Expedition, in the <i>Journal of the Geographical Society</i>
vol. xxii) it may be mentioned that Leichhardt says he had ice on
the Maranoa in 26 deg. 53 min. S. on the night of 31st August,
1847; and on turning to my own journal I find that at St.
Leonard's, at 11 p.m., 31st August, and again at 8 a.m., 1st
September, the temperature was 47 deg., and on 31st August, at 7
a.m., 42 deg. I find also frost occurred here on 1st and 2nd
September, and on the 3rd it was "<i>cold</i>." Leichhardt
mentions ice on the 1st, and says the "<i>southerly</i>" wind was
very <i>chilly</i> on the 3rd; the wind here being from S.E.;
that night the temperature here was as high as from 53 deg. to 56
deg., and on the Maranoa, the night was extremely mild;" The
thermometer at sunrise being 54 deg. whilst here it was nearly
the same. We learn also, that the wind there was
"<i>easterly</i>"; it was S.E. here, becoming due east on the 5th
September.</p>
<p>Again, on the night of the 9th September Leichhardt mentions
that it was <i>mild</i>&mdash;and on the 10th he had rain,
thunder and westerly wind; at St. Leonard's the wind was from N.
and N.W., and on the 9th there were a hot wind lightning and the
appearance of a heavy storm, with rain on the evening of the 9th
and the 10th.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <i>northerly</i> wind of the night of the 26th
August and Leichhardt, was similar to the N.E. wind which
commenced here the same day and became north on the next; a heavy
gale blowing the while from the north along the east coast of
Tasmania.</p>
<p>The only other observation I have to make on this diary is,
that Leichhardt mentions the existence of some probably new
animal, from traces of burrows of a peculiar kind, observed on
26th August on the Horse-track River, and he makes further
mention of it on the 7th of September as burrowing in "<i>red
soil</i>." Now Mitchell mentions (<i>Tropical Australia</i>,
p.150) that the "<i>red</i>" <i>decomposed</i> rock of the
country on the Cogoon was "<i>hollowed out by some burrowing
animal</i>, whose tracks had opened ways through the thick thorny
scrub," enabling him to lead his horses to the top of Mount Red
Cap. As these traces of the supposed new animal extend over
several miles of country, it may be of use, if some settler there
will endeavour to ascertain what this animal is, and whether it
is really&mdash;<i>new</i>.</p>

<br>
<p><i>Monday, the</i> 15<i>th</i> [sic] <i>August</i>,
1847.&mdash;We were encamped on Acacia Creek, where we arrived
yesterday evening very late in coming from Gogg's, mistaking
Gogg's Station road for Windeyer's Dray-road. Windeyer has built
a bridge over the Dogwood Creek, which we did however not see.
The waterholes had so steep banks that our mules and horses went
very far in search of water. The boiling of our salt mear, with
which Gogg had kindly provided us, took also a long time. We did
not start before 12 o'clock; travelled 2½ miles N.W. to Dogwood
creek; went about ½ mile up it to our crossing place; travelled
down 2½ miles S. and S.W. to the crossing place of my first
expedition. The ground along the ridges, either very rotten of
Cypresspine ridges, from the crossing place of my first
expedition, 3 miles N.W. along a many winding creek, with many
lagoons and water-gums. Wommai shot here three ducks. We passed
the while-tree camp, crossed the creed, which is here lined with
a small Tea-tree and has rocky holes. We travelled N.W. about
6½-7 miles. Acadia underwood, the Tamarind myrtle, the glaucous
narrow-leaved Ironbark were prevailing timber. We crossed two
rocky watercourses, the last of which spread out higher up in
narrow water Gum-tree flats. Here our dogs ran a native dog, but
did not kill him. The country opened&mdash;several ridges and
hills, one of which I descended to the southward; came to a
watercourse which went west, and found very soon
water&mdash;about 14 miles in 5¾ hours.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, the</i> 17<i>th August</i>.&mdash;Yesterday, about
five-six species of Acacia were found in blossom; the colour of
all is yellow; one has a pinnate leaf the others phyllodia. One
of the glaucous phyllodia resembles so much the pinnate one that
I should not be surprised if they were only sexually different;
the Acacia with hooked phyllodia, which I found formerly, was not
met with, as I kept to the left of my former tracks. To-day we
found a small shrubby Grevillea, with iron-coloured blossoms, it
grew principally in the rusty-gum forest. A small shrub spreading
out in round patches, belonging to the Lythrum tribe (10
<i>stam</i>. 1 <i>pist</i>.) was growing in similar localities.
We followed the watercourse for a short distance&mdash;it turned
to the S.W.; I kept W. and came on another watercourse which I
equally followed; it turned also S.W. and S. After 3 miles we
came to the large creek, which, no doubt, is my Bottle-tree-scrub
creek. It has abundance of water and its bed is sandy and sound;
parallel lagoons in the large grassy valley with fine
Water-gum-trees&mdash;the timber was Ironbark, Gum, Cypresspine,
Forest-oak&mdash;Bricklow scrub was seen to the
right.&mdash;Three miles farther through rusty-gum forest, we
came to a fine rocky creek with plenty of water, but stiff
grasses and grass-tree; 1½ miles further another watercourse, and
shortly afterwards another joining the former; the remaining 3
miles were fine undulating or flat, Ironbark forest well grassed,
very open. At the end of the stage, about 12 miles W.S.W. from
our last night's camp, a fine chain of ponds full of water in a
very open country, with Dombomgum prevailing; the flats with
Apple-tree. A kangaroo was chased by Camden into a waterhole, and
shot by Wommai. We saw long patches of forest-land burnt by the
natives&mdash;kangaroo bones and broken emu eggs in an old
camp&mdash;to-day and yesterday, fine weather, but
cloudy&mdash;the night clear, the latter part of it cold with
heavy dew.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, the</i> 18<i>th August</i>.&mdash;After having
finished our Kangaroo tail soup, and a good sized piece of
damper, we started full of anticipations of what the day would
bring. The country kept its open character for about 1½ miles,
when we came on a good sized creek, with water almost running, at
least filtering through the sands and pebbles. Our course was S.
70 deg W. We continued for about 2½ to 3 miles longer, the forest
became close and when we turned a little to the right in order to
avoid it, I came again on the creek we had left. We followed it
up for about 2 miles. Hills and ledges of rock enclosed it from
both sides. When we ascended the gully which formed its head, we
came on a tableland with patches of the hook-leafed acacia and of
Baekea. Another species of Acacia, the long branches of which
covered with yellow blossoms formed as many rays, made a pleasing
impression on the eye; a species of Hakea with red blossoms and
the leaves of Ac. <i>pungens</i> but pinnatifid, was also
tolerably abundant. Two miles further, during which the country
fell towards S.E., I came on another creek with sharp rocky
ledges on which Boronia <i>latifolia</i>? grew. We now changed
our course to S.W. and when this brought us to another rocky
creek, we turned to the southward in order to come to a less
broken country. We had scarcely left this creek when Bricklow
made its appearance to the right and left. Box with Vitex formed
the forest between the rush of waters to the southward. We
followed this and came to dry waterholes&mdash;the scrub
continued and the box flat widened, and when we turned round the
scrub to the S.W. we passed for 4 miles over most beautiful open
box ridges. Myall grew on several spots; the open country
extended to the S.E. as far as the eye could reach. At the end of
the stage we came to a fine creek with very large ponds of water,
which no doubt are permanent. Musselshells are everywhere; Myall
is abundant; the sandflies are troublesome, first part of last
night cloudy, latter part clear. Thermometer at sunrise 38 deg.
Slight airs from N.W.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, the</i> 19<i>th August</i>.&mdash;We travelled
about 5 miles to the westward; for 2 miles the open ridges
continued; but soon Vitex and Myall scrub filled the box forest
and further on treeless plains surrounded with scrub, which
reminded me of the scrub plains of the Dawson, enticed me on in
the same course. Dense scrub and scrubby hills however stopped my
progress, and I had to beat back following the outline of the
scrub. I went to the S.E. and even to the eastward, pushed
through some Bricklow scrub and came at last to a lower part of
the creek which we had left and which ran S.E. &amp; S. and
turned at our present camp to the S.S.W. From the scrub plains we
saw blackfellows' smoke to the southward. The country along the
creek is open with Myall and Box, the waterholes are large, deep
and reedy, and it seems that this creek forms the outline of a
scrubby country, and is the receptacle of its waters. Wommai shot
a duck&mdash;we saw many kangaroos. It was cloudy in the
afternoon; slight wind from the southward. Sandflies made their
appearance; swallows and orewills.</p>
<p><i>Friday, the</i> 20<i>th August</i>.&mdash;My latitude is 26
deg. 39 min., thermometer 40 deg. Night dewy not too cold. Wommai
had tethered the horse too near the boggy waterhole, it went into
the water and got bogged. After much trouble we succeeded in
getting it out. Breakfast, fat cake (3 lbs.) and one black duck.
I wished to follow the creek, which I hoped would turn to the
S.W. I was however mistaken, it went to the S.E. Now I left it
and passed some Myall groves and Box trees with Vitex underwood
and entered the scrub in a due west direction; this scrub was of
the same composition as the Flourgill, patches of Casuarina, of
Bricklow, either in shrubs or trees, rises of Cypresspine and
narrow-leaved Ironbark. One of these rises was higher than the
other and it seemed to me that it formed a watershed, the creeks
E. of it going to the E. and S.E.; those to the West of it going
to the Southward. After 9 miles westing and slightly southing I
came on a watercourse going to the westward which I followed
down. It soon brought me to a larger creek, with as fine ponds of
water as those in the creek we had left. Here our dogs started an
emu, with a great number of young ones; the mother defended her
brood against Camden, but ran away when Wommai came with his
horse. Chase was given; but it was unsuccessful. I followed the
large creek for about 4 miles. It is very open with Box ridges,
which are perfectly sound, and Myall groves occasionally along
its banks. On the patches of young grass, numerous emus must have
fed, for their dung was very abundant. When the creek turned to
the southward (its course had been W. and even N.W.) we passed
over the ridge and dropped into the valley of another creek,
equally provided with water. I dare say we came out 13 miles W.,
20 deg. S. Beautiful weather; cumuli during the afternoon; I
suffered a great deal of palpitation of the heart (perhaps in
consequence of strong tea and smoking); I dreamt of
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* and
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* she was as
blooming and beautiful as ever, and showed (as I dreamt at least)
some solicitude about me.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, the</i> 21<i>st August</i>.&mdash;We had scarcely
travelled 1½ miles to the westward, when we came to a small creek
with the usual character, shallow beds and sedgy boggy water
holes, with a good supply of bad water. Continuing to a Bricklow
shrub which we skirted, and continued over fine Box and
silver-leaved Iron-bark hills for about 2½ miles, when a large
creed was before us running N.&mdash;S.; the hills rose higher on
its right bank, and I thought of seeing plains gleaming through
the forest&mdash;I was however mistaken; for after 2 miles of
travelling we entered a most infernal scrub, through which we
worked for about 4 miles, when we came to an opening and a
watercourse, which we followed down for about 8 miles; it soon
took the character of the other creeks, and its holes were
excellently supplied with water; the natives seemed particularly
fond of it, for their humpies were almost on eery waterhole, and
they had burned the old grass, probably to have a chance at the
numerous kangaroos, one of which we saw slowly jumping from one
of the waterholes into the scrub. The ducks were very numerous.
Wommai shot one, and Mr. Bunce two. Our tether horse, which had
been bogged two days ago, was almost knocked up; the night was
rather mild; the boggy nature of the waterholes has the great
inconvenience, that our mules and horses are too afraid to
approach, and go, consequently, without their fair allowance of
water.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, the</i> 22<i>nd August</i>.&mdash;We had a duck
breakfast, and started early in order to follow the creek farther
down; for the scrub prevented us taking a more advantageous
course, the creek running S.S.E. and perhaps S.E. Lower down the
Box-flats became puffy; and still lower the Cypresspine and the
White-gum appeared on the rising ground; the waterholes got
partly (particularly on the right side) rocky; rotten sandstone.
After about 7 miles collateral lagoons formed; low Box-flats, all
inundated during high water, extended along the creek; the rising
ground was very rotten; the scrub seemed to recede, and we left
the creek, steering for the smoke of the natives. As we went
along to the S.W. and westward, skirting the scrub, smoke rose
all along to the S.W., W. and N.W., and I expected a large creek
before us. That was the case&mdash;after 3 miles travelling we
came to the deep channel of a good-sized creek, larger than
Dogwood Creek, with flood-marks above the banks. A large body of
water must come down occasionally; the bed is sandy and sound;
the water was still running; the character of the country is very
much that of Dogwood Creek; Cypresspine and White-gum on a rotten
soil; the natives appear very numerous. Mr Bunce and Wommai
remained behind duck shooting, and have not yet arrived&mdash;I
hope no accident has happened. A cold southerly wind was blowing
the whole day; clouds passed in the morning, but disappeared
about 9 o'clock. I suffered again from palpitations, though I
have not smoked these two last days. Mr Bunce has told me many
very annoying stories about M.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,
H&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, and
T&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, which
trouble me a great deal.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, the</i> 25<i>th August</i>.&mdash;The two
absentees did not come up to the camp on Sunday evening nor
during the forenoon on Monday; I consequently supposed that a
serious accident had happened either to Mr Bunce or to Wommai,
and resolved to return to the creek we had left, to ascertain in
what direction they had gone. We fired again at sunset, but
without receiving any answer, and I was in the greatest anxiety
about their fate. Next morning, however, just when we were
looking out for our horses, they arrived. They had continued down
the creek without ascertaining the direction of our tracks; they
had come to the junction of our creek with a very large one; had
found three fresh horse-tracks, and supposing them our's had
followed them until late at night; they had crossed the large
creek, to which we had come on Sunday; next day they had still
continued and had considered that the mule-tracks were wanting,
but foolishly supposed that the natives had rushed us. They now
returned and camped on Monday night again at the little creek
where they had lost us. Next morning they had come on our
returning tracks and had followed them to the camp; they had seen
a great number of natives, and had spoken with some of them; they
had seen the little gin with the white patch on the neck, who
passed our camp in going up to the Bunya Bunya. The most careless
inattention to our tracks had produced all this loss of time and
all this anxiety. We saddled our mules, after their finishing
their breakfast, and went on their tracks about 2 miles beyond
Sunday Creek. The fresh tracks belonged to three horses, two of
which were shod; one horse had a very broad hoof&mdash;one of the
party had walked. The natives, whose fires were burning all
about, and whose cooees and tomahawks we had heard in Sunday
Camp, had followed those tracks which we supposed to be Archer's
and Chauvel's, 2 miles below the junction of Sunday Creek with
the supposed Dogwood Creek, and struck off to the westward, the
creek turning a little to the southward. The country was the same
as that between Bunce's and Sunday Creeks,&mdash;Cypresspine
forest, with the glaucous pinnate Acacia in full blossom (a
magnificent sight), the soil puffy; the Box flats near the river
small&mdash;subject to inundations, with patches of bare rock
towards the banks. After having left the river, we continued
westward until scrubs compelled us to go to the southward. We
skirted the scrubs, and made about 7½ miles W. 15 deg. S. and
camped at a small scrubby creek, which, according to Wommai,
joined the river about two miles lower down.</p>
<p><i>To-day, the</i> 25<i>th</i>,&mdash;We skirted again the
scrubs, and we succeeded in finding tolerable country about 4
miles to the N.W. It was an open Myall scrub with dense Bricklow
to our right. We passed over a ridge of open forest land
(narrow-leaved Ironbark and Cypresspine); about 1 mile further we
saw the high hill to our left; the country, for the other 7 miles
was, west&mdash;changingly open, undulating Box forest and scrub.
One Dodonaea scrub pushed us again to the southward. We crossed
the heads of several water-courses and a swamp about ½ mile to
the east of a river which reminds me still stronger of the
Robinson than Sunday Creek. It has a sandy bed, with tea-trees
growing in it; it is not running, but the small pools are covered
with ironocre; the waterholes are partly well boggy. Exactly at
our crossing-place we found the tracks of a party of horsemen,
which appear different from those of Archer, as the big-hoofed
horse is wanting. Wommai says, "they were four persons."</p>
<p><i>August</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday morning the
thermometer was 24 deg., this morning, at sunrise, 38 deg. The
first part of night cloudy&mdash;cleared up at 10 o'clock; we
travelled about 14 miles due west; after having left the river,
in the bed of which well-polished pieces of fossil wood and
variously coloured flints were found, we passed over 1-1½ mile of
grassy country with Appletree resembling that at Charley's Creek.
After we passed for 5 miles through a scrubby box country with
Bricklow, Myall and Vitex; for 2 miles the country opened into a
pleasing Moreton Bay ash forest, with a large tree Acacia and
clusters of Vitex. Here we met first with the deep burrow of an
unknown animal&mdash;the open shaft was about 5 feet deep, and
the burrow itself went from the bottom of it horizontally; it was
about 1½ feet in diameter, the track resembled that of a child,
the dung that of an old man kangaroo. From this open country
which seemed to extend to the southward, we entered into a
Dodonaea scrub for several miles and came out into a scrubby
Cypresspine country with several fine Box hollows extending to
the south by W., and joining probably a large creek from the
northward with long reedy waterholes, with a sound bed, with fine
watergum and small narrowleaved tea trees. The confines of the
river are rather thickly wooded with Box saplings and Myall. The
character of the country in general was scrubby, unfit for any
pastoral purposes; but it is probable that it opens and improves
along the river which I suppose to be to the southward. Our mule
No.4 was bogged in the river of yesterday; horse tracks were seen
coming from the westward; they belonged to 5 horses&mdash;two of
which appeared to be leading horses. Four native companions
[brolgas] and 4 small cranes were seen yesterday evening; a
flight of ducks passed our camp during the night and went down
the river. We live again on our dried beef for breakfast.</p>
<p><i>August the</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;When we were sitting last
night near the fire, we heard the disagreeable call of a
nightbird, a loud shrill "pish-sh-sh". Wommai watched it, and
succeeded in shooting it; it proved to be the little owl
<i>Cyclops delicatula</i> or <i>elegans</i> of Gould. Behind a
little shrub a bird (probably a goatsucker) had camped for a long
time, he had left a large heap of dung. The thermometer was 38
deg. immediately after sunrise; it is now at sunset 70 deg. We
travelled about 20 miles west, 6 deg. south over the most
miserable country. After 3½ hours we came to the first large
creek, with <i>sandy bed, reedy waterholes:</i> small-leafed
Tea-tree and long linear-leafed Acacia the natives were burning
the grass near it. After 4½ hours from that creek we came to
another equally large, inclining to the S.E., its bed equally
sandy, its waterholes reedy. Near these creeks the country was
tolerably open, but scarcely one mile from each, a nasty Dodonaea
and Cypresspine scrub covered the whole intervening country. It
seems that these scrubs cover ridges parallel to the creeks, for
we saw the high land we had left, in form of a range from the
west side of the first creek, and a large range was seen to the
westward of the second creek on which we are encamped. <i>Hakea
lorea</i> is still in blossom, Stenochilus grows abundantly in
the openings of the Cypresspine scrub. The first part of last
night was cloudy; it cleared up from the northward at 9 o'clock.
In the afternoon to-day and yesterday, the clouds got very
heavy&mdash;we had full moon yesterday.</p>
<p>I could not help remarking how cheerfully the birds sing near
these creeks, the Oreoica, (the ventriloquist) the Magpie, the
little Flycatcher, and several others make themselves incessantly
heard.</p>
<p><i>August, the</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;The thermometer 32 deg.
We travelled scarcely 2 miles, when we came to ridges which were
covered with Dodonaea and Vitex and Cypresspine scrub; they
extended 10 miles farther and were covered at their western half
with scrub of the mountain Acacia of the worst description. The
dead timber made the road extremely circuitous and the progress
slow. The highest part was composed of various interesting
aromatic shrubs of a species of Philotheca and of a red
Metrosideros and two other rutaceous plants. Being tired of an
apparently never-ceasing succession of these Acacia ridges, we
took a watercourse, running W. 30 deg. S., which we followed down
for 3 or 4 miles, when the waterholes became rocky, Watergum
appeared round them, and they contained a supply of good water.
We were encamped for a short time, and the fat cake not quite
ready, when two natives walked boldly up after having cooeed and
received our cooee in return. I met them with Mr. Isaacs about
fifty yards from the camp, in order to ascertain something about
the Balonne. I gave each of them three brass buttons, to show our
friendly intentions, and gave them to understand that we were to
sleep one night and then continue to the westward. A third youth
approached afterwards; one of the old men was slim with a long
beard and mustache, and very wild looking, the other was an
elderly man, with a white beard, and of very quiet expression. We
parted good friends, thought Mr. Bunce told me that he heard them
talking near our waterhole&mdash;they came perhaps there to fetch
water.</p>
<p><i>August the</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 34 deg.
Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, the</i> 31<i>st August</i>.&mdash;We had a sound
sleep, notwithstanding the want of water, which was not felt very
much by any of the party. As soon as the mules came in we started
and followed the watercourse for about 7 miles S.W. by S., when
Cypresspine, rocky waterholes, Watergum and patches of fresh
burnt grass appeared and the call of Grallium Australe indicated
the presence of water. We made our breakfast and started, after
two hours halt for 2 miles due west, when after crossing an open
ridge of Moreton Bay ash and a slight hollow I found myself <i>on
Mitchell's and Kennedy's tracks</i>; the dray-tracks of the first
were almost entirely worn out by the succeeding rains; the three
cart-tracks of Kennedy, with a great number of horses, were, on
the contrary, very fresh. I followed the track to the northward
and came, after about 3 miles, to a camp of <i>Mitchell's</i>,
marked 80, on the river side. The river has lower down a broad
sandy bed with lines of small trees, but is there without water;
the large waterhole was surrounded with reeds. The country
reminded me of Charly's Creek; the rises are frequently sandy
with Cypresspine, Moreton Bay ash, Appletree, some few scattered
silver-leaved Ironbark, and two species of Acacia (one drooping
like that of Blackfellow Creek) the cocoa-tree Eos was seen on
the patches of fresh burnt grass; I followed the track for 4
miles further; it left the river and passed open sandy
Cypresspine ridges and through Vitex scrub. I camped at a fine
waterhole in a good-sized creek, in latitude 26 deg. 53 min. The
flats are Box forest, more or less open, as the young saplings
form long stretches of underwood. We passed the bullock's
head.</p>

<p><i>September the</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 26 deg. Ice
in the bucket, not on the waterhole. Turned again to
<i>Mitchell's track</i> which, after having past several sandy
Cypresspine ridges, on one of which I saw a fine Sterculia tree
and whole thickets of a shrubby Aster approached the river and
followed it, in cutting its windings for about 9 miles, when we
came to another camp of <i>Kennedy's</i> with one of the trees
marked 79. <i>We expected</i> 81 <i>and the lessening number
puzzled us not a little</i>. At this place the river is joined by
a creek from the left, running N.N.E.-S.S.W., and by another
larger one from the right, running about N.W.-S.E. The course of
the river for the whole extent of 12½ miles is N.N.W. Its bed is
still sandy with Tea-tree bushes growing in it, and with
Water-gum and Apple-tree at its banks. The flats are more or less
open, with Box trees and Box saplings. The track crosses the
river and follows it at its right bank. Between the west creek
and the river there is ridge and two rather prominent hills, with
Cypresspine and very sandy slopes. Wommai chased here an emu
without success, but saw from the slope two large hills to the
northward, which I supposed to be Mount Bindango and Mount
Abundance; we shall come to them to-morrow. Our fat is done, and
we commence with gelatine soup. Lat. 26 deg. 40 min.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 27 degrees
at sunrise. After having menaged our soup of two ducks and a
bronze-winged pigeon, we started following again Kennedy's dray
track. After 4 miles we saw a hill to the left and went up to its
top in order to have a view; there was a range to the eastward,
striking nearly N.N.W.-S.S.E.; other ranges or ridges are to the
northward. It was evident, that <i>one old dray track returning
was below Kennedy's fresh tracks</i>; it was visible by the
little trees being turned to the southward. The country appeared
to me either scrubby or of the same description as I had seen
beforehand on the river. Mr. Isaacs, however, said that the
country appeared to open to the westward, and that it was
possible that the little creek we had seen joining the river was
the <i>Cogoon of Mitchell</i>. I went consequently to the
westward and came again at first to Box ridges with some Myall,
and afterwards to sandy Cypresspine ridges; these continued as a
division of water to the westward; we kept S.W. and S.S.W., and
came at last on a forky creek and more to the southward on a
chain of waterholes which brought me to the supposed Cogoon. The
country did not change; the Cypresspine ridges approached
frequently the creek, and formed high rocky banks; when they
receded limited Box and Apple-tree flats intervened; the creek
contains plenty of water, in sound good-sized water-holes. Here
Mr. Bunce observed the <i>faint track of a cart</i>, which was
probably <i>Mitchell's reconnoitering track</i>. The little
cruciferous plant is very frequent on the sandy flats and slopes
on the slopes of the east range these sands seemed equally to
exist; they first made me believe that they were plains or
downs.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 40 deg. We
heard distinctly the knocking of a tomahawk last night, shortly
after our arrival, and this morning we past the still burning
fire of a native camp, not ½ a mile from our own. It is probable
that the passing by of our horses and mules last night had made
him go away. We went down the creek to the junction for nearly 7
miles; the country was still the same limited Apple-tree and Box
flats, and sandy Cypresspine ridges. From the junction (camp 79)
we returned on our old track a little below camp 80. The country
appeared to me best round the camp 79; the sandy ridges are very
bad; the country round number 80 is extremely open, with Box, but
there are many hollows which are evidently under water during any
continuance of rainy weather. Wommai shot a black cormorant which
was skinned and put into the soup; <i>it had an extremely nasty
smell</i>. Mr. Isaacs has recommended <i>Johnny cakes</i> for the
morning of the 4th of September. Southerly wind very chilly. Our
old horse knocked up, and we had to leave it behind.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Night extremely mild;
thermometer, at sunrise, 54 deg. Easterly wind rather chilly;
first part of the last night cloudy. A whole swarm of white and
rose Cockatoos were seen on the ground, on an apparently dried-up
lagoon&mdash;they probably were feeding on some roots. Wommai had
observed a large hole, which the natives had dug to obtain roots,
the chewed parts of which were round the hole, he said they
belonged to young Sterculia. We travelled about 4 miles south,
when we came to the place where we first had met the dray road of
Sir Thomas Mitchell. A little further south we marked a tree with
a cross and an L in the wood. We travelled about 4 miles further
and came to a camp of Kennedy's on a lagoon in the bed of the
little creek we had camped at on the 30th August, and which we
had left the 31st. It is remarkable how far these waters run
parallel to each other. Fourteen miles further we came again on a
camp of Kennedy, where we had tried to obtain water in the sandy
bed of the river; the river had become very small and looked more
like an ana-branch of that we had left at camp 80. It seemed
however out of doubt that it was the same river. We continued a
short distance lower down and camped without water, the whole
country about us being burnt and burning. Wommai saw a native who
was stooping down and apparently occupied with digging roots. He
decamped as soon as he saw us. The country for the first 10 miles
from camp 80 was very open and extended a good way off the river;
further on hollows with water Box becomes frequent and it got
densely wooded with saplings. All the hollows and lagoons were
dry. Sandy ridges approached the river, and at one place a hilly
country covered with a green looking viscous grass had much the
appearance of real downs. But the grass was harsh and stiff and
good neither for cattle nor sheep. A new species of Grevillea
with downy pods was growing here. Mr. Bunce collected a fine
species of Senecio, a new Gnaphaluim and a yellow cruciferous
plant.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;We travelled 15 miles
further over a densely wooded country, with many hollows and
dried-up lagoons, without finding water. We passed some high
rocky ridges covered with scrub. At the end of this stage we came
to a camp of <i>Sir Thomas</i> marked 81; the creek was even
smaller than before. Supposing that water would not be very far,
I rode over to the right side of the river and found a fine
lagoon, which was however drying up; here we encamped and
satisfied our thirst and hunger. Mr. Isaacs shot a black Ibis. As
we were riding along we saw smoke of the natives to the south,
and this smoke seemed to hang down from a small cloud which
dissolved and formed again several times. The direction of the
river was S.E. as much as I could judge; for I was too tired to
carry my compass constantly in my hand. Mr. Bunce found a yellow
variety of the scrub Stenochilus, the red variety of which is
also common. Perry had the <i>shivers</i> last night, and Wommai
is not well; could the cormorant have anything to do with it?
Perry is well again to-day. These long stages are extremely
tiresome. Every one has taken advantage of the early camp to wash
his shirt. The night was mild, but the wind shifting during the
day is very chilly.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;My latitude at
Mitchell's camp lagoon was 27 deg. 28 min. As I intended to go
only to 27 deg. 30 min. I continued on the 6th along the river
for about 4 miles; at 2 or 3 miles we found a fine waterhole in
the bed, and thousands of Wood-swallows hovering about it. I now
struck off to the eastward and soon entered into a scrubby
country, which continued for 12 miles, when we were compelled to
camp without water at a small scrub plain. We tied our horses up
and started early this morning, continuing to the eastward. The
scrub which was composed yesterday of Box and Vitex and Dodonaea
with native Lemon and <i>Goodia</i>, of Bricklow and Casuarina,
and of Cypresspine thickets, was principally composed of the
latter with Stenochilus on a sandy soil; the Box openings became
more frequent and Apple-tree and Moreton Bay ash appeared as we
approached a creek with a fine large water-hole which runs W.N.W.
by E.S.E. We saw again the burrows of the new animal in the red
soil on which the Cypresspine grows, but its channels were not so
deep, and there were many holes close together. Mr Bunce shot
yesterday male and female of Platycercus Gilberti, the yellowhead
Philotis was also shot. We travelled about 6 miles to-day. Large
heaps of the straw of the native millet were lying on the little
scrub plain, the natives had no doubt made their harvest there.
Mr. Isaacs shot a black Ibis on Mitchell's Lagoon, and we had it
for yesterday's breakfast.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 7<i>th, Evening</i>.&mdash;After 2½ miles
travelling to the east passing all along through a low Box
country with frequent hollows; we arrived at the running river
which we considered identical with the Smoky one of Mr. Bunce;
its bed was sandy with many tea-trees and Water-gum, but no
Casuarina. We followed it up for about 7 miles, and passed three
watercourses, two of them with waterholes appeared to be creeks,
one perhaps the Lagoon river east of the Graftonridges. The low
box-flats and hollows extended along the river, but farther off
it seemed tolerably open, and we passed over a little plain.
Myall was observed in scattered specimens and the Moreton Bay Ash
and the Apple-tree make their appearance with the Water-box.
Swainsonia is very abundant; two wood ducks were shot.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Bunce discovered
this morning <i>very old horse dung at the very place where we
encamped</i>. We continued to follow up the river, and had gone
scarcely 3 miles, when dray tracks were observed; they were very
<i>old</i> and <i>faint</i>, and belonged to <i>Mitchell's
Expedition. Fresh horse tracks</i> were seen coming <i>down the
River</i>, and apparently turning up to the N.W., <i>on
Mitchell's track</i>, 29<i>th April</i> 1846. <i>These horse
tracks were observed all along our road, and at one place an</i>
L <i>was cut into a small water gum tree with a black-fellow's
tomahawk</i>. We travelled about 8½ miles N.N.E., when a large
creek joined from the northward (it was gently running according
to Mr. Isaacs) and the river now took an almost due easterly
direction; we followed it for 8 miles farther E. by N.; the
Water-box flats were very extensive; the flood-marks very high;
the lagoons became more numerous, and a very large one was seen
not long before camping, where the river took a northerly and
even westerly bend; its bed was sandy or pebbly and sound; it was
lined with Tea-tree, and the wider holes with reeds; they were
teeming with ducks, which our sportsmen were not able to kill. It
was a fine day, with a gentle easterly breeze; the country was,
in general, closely wooded, but some patches were very open and
promised fair to widen farther off the river; in some places the
banks of the river were scrubby, one with Bricklow, mostly with
Box-saplings and Vitex. The Unio is still the only shell in the
camps of the natives which seems very numerous; this makes me
believe, that the Condamine has nothing to do with it, as it
contains mostly Anodontas with thick black epidermis.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;The night
mild&mdash;thermom. at sunrise, 42 deg. We came about 18 miles
E.N.E., over a country very similar to that of yesterday. We
passed some fine open patches but sandy soil, and Cypresspine and
Moreton Bay ash. We crossed a creek from the northward, about 9
miles from the camp, and a second very large one about 15 miles;
the Water-box flats and lateral hollows were likely yesterday's,
several chains of ponds. Towards the large creek the Myall became
very abundant. We passed, at about 12 miles, <i>a tree marked</i>
H <i>and another after having crossed the largest creek</i>, the
latter was in a very good sound country, however, still with the
Moreton Bay ash. Wommai shot 5 ducks, and got 5 young black
cormorants out of a nest, which was built on a branch overhanging
the water. A very downy Plantago is very common; the onion-leaved
Antherium likewise.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;The night was mild
though clear; in the morning it became overcast, and when we
started it began to rain, sometimes in heavy showers, with a
light westerly movement in the clouds, and thunder. When we were
encamped at about 4 o'clock, a heavy thunderstorm came on from
the westward, and it was fortunate that we had succeeded in
lighting a fire, around which we patiently waited for its
termination, having rolled our blankets round us. The following
night was overcast again with the exception of one clearing. In
the morning of the 11<i>th</i>, it cleared up perfectly and
became very fine. We had new moon the 9<i>th Greenwich time</i>.
We crossed a small creek after about nine miles travelling, and a
very large one with broad sandy bed; about 4 miles farther, the
country was still closely wooded with very open, puffy, Moreton
Bay ash and Cypresspine rises, patches of Bricklow and Vitex
scrub. We went about 6 miles N. 70 deg. W. Wommai shot some ducks
for breakfast.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;The river easted still
more to-day than yesterday; we travelled about 18 miles E. by N.,
and encamped a short distance off the river, at a little scrub
creek; we crossed, in 9 miles, the Horse track river, which
preserved its former character, and a fine creek containing large
lagoons of water, which, no doubt, is the creek we had camped at
in going out the night before we arrived at the Horse track
river. Mr. Bunce and Wommai, who had been down the river when
they were lost, stated, that opposite our camp a large lagoon
existed near the river, covered with Pelicans and every
description of water-fowl.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;The night was very
dewy. We had last night 5 teal, and this morning 3 teal; one
black duck and a wallobi; Wommai had shot 6 and 7 at one shot,
but had lost five of them in riding along. We had not gone more
than 3 miles east, when we came to the river; the country was
scrubby with the exception of one or two fine puffy hills; the
Bricklow scrub continued some way up the river, which, after its
cessation, makes a great bend to the southward; Wommai and Bunce
had camped the first night below this scrub. Up to the Sunday
River the country is again timbered with Cypresspine, Moreton Bay
ash, silver-leaved Ironbark; the underwood is a glaucous
pinnate-leaved Acacia; the soil is puffy; water-box flats with
gullies intervene between these detached stretches of open
country. We crossed the Sunday River and Bunce's Creek, and
camped about 3 miles higher up. The Emu-herb, a legumenous
aromatic plant is plentiful, and our mules and horses enjoy it
greatly, but it grows not on the puffy soil. The country which
was burnt and burning when we went down, is now clothed with
green grass, which looks particularly fresh after the rain of the
10th. We saw at first two, and afterwards one emu; Camden is too
heavy for them. The creek has decreased greatly in size; it is
rocky and its banks frequently perpendicular precipices; it
cannot be the Condamine, but it must have something to do with
Dogwood Creek or Bottle-tree Creek, as it is still running. I
have forgotten to mention that we saw a great number of very
large cockroach-like Orthopterous insects running over the
ground, where the young grass did allow us to see the surface.
They came out of their holes, no doubt, in consequence of the
rain of the preceding day.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;We crossed the Smoky
River and travelled about 11 miles east 15 deg. north. The first
3 miles were very open, some sound box country and puffy
Cypresspine ridges. Here we entered into Bricklow and Casuarina
scrub, and travelled in it for about 5-6 miles, when we came to a
most beautiful open Box country, clothed with the rich green of
young grass. Wommai gave chase to an old-man kangaroo, which
Camden succeeded in keeping at bay until our gay sportsman shot
him. His head was remarkably short and broad. An open Box-wood
country on the hollow heads of little creeks particularly to the
S.E. We had not continued more than 3 miles, when we met a large
creek running strong S.-N. This is no doubt the river we left,
having been joined by the two Emu creeks and by the small river
next to them to the eastward. Diuvis <i>maculata</i> in blossom;
its tubers have an agreeable though glutinous taste.</p>
<p><i>September the</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;The thermometer, at
sunrise, 46 deg. The latitude by Altair 26 deg. 53 min. Last
night we enjoyed one of the legs of the old-man kangaroo, which
stewed for about three hours gave us a most excellent soup, mixed
with a little flour. This morning we had the other leg, leaving
the tail and rump for to-morrow's breakfast, and the fore
quarters for the dogs. We travelled about 12 miles 15 deg. N.;
the first 3 miles were an open Box country limited by a belt of
Dodonaea scrub. Having passed it, we entered upon most beautiful
scrub-downs, with small tufts of Bricklow, and with some isolated
Box-trees; the grass was all burnt and looked now fresh and
green. To the left dense Bricklow-scrub extended, to the right
Box with Dodonaea and Vitex underwood; we passed over at least 4
miles of the downs, when we came again upon fine open
Box-country, which extended for 5 miles, our course was then
intercepted by a large creek, with high rocky ledges and running
water. It formed a large pond in winding to the S.W., and to the
east again. This pond was nearly 1½&mdash;2 miles long, deep; but
a rocky bed, now empty; went across about that distance from the
bottom of the pond; we followed the creek until we found a
crossing-place, when we passed over to its left side. One mile
before this crossing-place 3 trees, were marked with B, one of
them was cut into the wood, the bark being removed. At the
crossing, Wommai shot two Teals and one Blackduck, and observed
cattle tracks. We followed the creek for about 3 miles higher up.
Its banks were rather scrubby, with limited patches of good
country; the opposite (right) side looked better. The question
was what creek it was, and I am inclined to believe that it is
Dogwood Creek. With this supposition my reckoning and several
other circumstances agree. The flood marks are not so high as
they were when we left the Condamine; the Anadonta is wanting,
the creek is running and neither Charly's Creek nor the Condamine
was; the Acacia, with glaucous phyllodia is very frequent; it was
not so frequent at the Condamine. But the country has entirely
changed, it is for the most part sound and Myall is common. It
gets very cloudy, and a cold wind blew during the whole day from
the eastward. The creek and the Box forest were full of
horse-tracks as if by gentlemen examining the country.</p>

<p align="center">LEICHHARDT'S EXPEDITION.<br>
<br>
(Extract of a letter from Dr. Leichhardt.)</p>
<p align="right">Russel's Station, Darling Downs,<br>
<br>
1st August, 1847.</p>
<p>The news of my return to the Downs will no doubt have reached
you by the last steamer from Moreton Bay. I had hoped to go by
her to Sydney, and that expectation, added to a very severe
rheumatism in my hands, prevented my writing by her. I wrote to
you last from Charley's Creek, mentioning the loss and recovery
of my mules, horses, and cattle. I had despatched Mr. Hely in
quest of intelligence of Sir T. Mitchell's expedition, of whose
return I had been informed, but by some accident of the post,
neither your letters nor Sir Thomas's despatches ever reached me.
Mr. Hely, Mr. Turnbull, and Brown joined me forty miles farther
on my journey, and we travelled quietly without accident down the
Dawson, then running so strong as to compel us to take advantage
of a large tree which had fallen across it, to convey our baggage
over. At Ruined Castle Creek I left one of my horses which had
become hopelessly lame. At Expedition Range, the rains set in,
and the ground soon became so boggy that our mules sank to their
bellies, and we made but slow progress. All the water-courses and
creeks between Expedition and Christmas Ranges became flooded,
and compelled us to make a long roundabout to head them.</p>
<p>Deception Creek and Comet Creek were swollen into immense
rivers, and all the surrounding country was inundated. I had
feared the Mackenzie would stop us, and on our arrival at that
river, after seven weeks' travelling from Dried-beef Creek, my
fears were but too fully realised, There had been several cases
of illness as we travelled through the scrub, but here the whole
party were attacked by fever, which subsequently assumed the
character of fever and ague. I suffered from it for nine days,
and it left me very weak for a long while after. We had to wait
for three weeks before the river was fordable, and after getting
over the party were so exhausted by illness, we found ourselves
wholly unable to proceed, and had to remain for three weeks
longer to recover our strength; no doubt the disease was very
depressing, though not of that dangerous character which the
party apprehended, most of whom had hitherto been unacquainted
with illness of any kind. Our energy, however, was much broken,
and our bodily strength entirely prostrated for the time. From
the idea that change of place and slight exertion would operate
beneficially on our health, I resolved to move on with the
strongest of the party, and accordingly proceeded with the stock
towards Peak Range, which I knew to be only sixty miles from the
junction of the Comet and Mackenzie rivers. After the first
stage, however, our helplessness became so apparent, that I saw
the impracticability of dividing our party, and returned with my
healthy black (poor Brown was quite knocked up), and brought in
the remainder of the party with all our luggage, to my halting
ground. Here our goats and sheep strayed away from the camp. No
one was able to watch them, and we were at length compelled to
leave them behind.</p>
<p>After a rest of three days we again moved on for three days
more, making about thirty miles in all, and reached the Downs of
the Upper Mackenzie and Peak Range. Here the loss of the horses
compelling us to stop, and as we had no more sheep, we killed the
first head of cattle. I had some hope that the change of diet,
from fat mutton to dried beef, might operate favourably on our
health, but in this also I was disappointed, as the rain set in
as the meat was drying, and it consequently become tainted and
unpalatable. After having stopped here for nearly a fortnight, we
again advanced about ten miles farther. The black whom I had sent
for the cattle, mistook our track and passed us when he had found
them, and after watching them, left them during the night to
rejoin us. During the interval they strayed away. I again sent
two of the party in pursuit, namely, Mr. Hely and Brown, and
moved on my camp towards Peak Range. Unfortunately, Brown lost
his horse the first night, and they were compelled to return to
us for fresh horses and provisions, without having found the
cattle. Thus the cattle got a long way in advance, became
dispersed in the scrub, and frightened probably by the natives,
became so wild that when Mr. Hely and the blacks again approached
them, they were so wild, they only succeeded in bringing back
nine out of thirty-seven, after a fortnight's absence from the
camp, Here we killed another bullock and dried the meat, and
endeavoured by using great vigilance to retain the others. But in
spite of all our efforts the wild brutes broke away every night,
and in five days we lost them altogether. Mr. Hely and Brown had
again started in pursuit of the others, but after an absence of
ten days, during which they had been overtaken by sickness, they
returned unsuccessful. Nothing now was left but to go myself upon
this errand, and accordingly I went with Jemmy, the black, to
that part of our track which I thought they were most likely to
have retreated to, and after a week's anxious search, I came upon
four, which I brought back to camp, where I found all my
companions ill with fever, and the mules and horses gone.</p>
<p>I now saw the thorough helplessness of our position, that all
further endeavour was vain, and that we had nothing for it but a
speedy return. I cannot express to you the extreme agony of mind
I endured when this distressing conviction came upon me.</p>
<p>I immediately set about collecting the mules and horses,
leaving the cattle in charge of the party. The mules had
separated, which they had not done since leaving Charley's Creek.
I followed six of them for ninety miles on our track towards
Expedition Range, but could not overtake them, and was compelled
to return to Camp, with seven others. On my arrival I found, as
indeed I had anticipated, that my companions had not been able to
retain the Cattle, which had gone off the morning after I left.
They had, however, again secured them, and had killed one and
dried the meat, which was of the greatest advantage to us. They
had also recovered three horses and three mules, which thus
increased our stock to ten horses and nine mules.</p>
<p>Leaving our tea, salt, shot, and other baggage behind, we
started on our road home, and after travelling thirty days
without any interruption we reached the camp of Messrs. Blyth and
Che[au]vel, on the Condamine, on the 21st July, and on the 28th
the station of Mr. H. S. Russel, on Darling Downs, where I
propose to leave my things till a new party is organized, which I
hope will be about the beginning of next May.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the many unforeseen hardships we endured, my
party behaved extremely well.</p>
<p>I am indeed sadly vexed by this disappointment: I find I have
lost a year of my life in effecting nothing, and have been
obliged to turn back from the very point at which I had proposed
to strike to the westward. At the Downs I read the account of Sir
T. Mitchell's discoveries. I find he has crossed, my track at
Expedition Range, but farther to the westward than I did; his
Mudge-kye is the most distant of my Christmas Range, his Mantuan
Downs are my Albinia Downs; his Nogoa is my Comet River, though I
did not go so far up as to see the junction of the Salvator and
the Claude; and I am afraid that as his Belyando turns out to be
the Cape, his Victoria will turn out to be the Clarke, the
largest tributary of the Burdekin from the westward.</p>
<p>I am desirous to examine the country between my track and Fitz
Roy Downs, which I shall do as soon as my rheumatism will allow
me, for at present I am laid up with it.</p>

<p align="center">DR. LEICHHARDT.</p>
<p><span class="u">We</span> have the pleasure of announcing that
<span class="u">Dr. Leichhardt</span> has returned in good health
to Sydney, and that nothing daunted by his late reverses, he has
determined to make another attempt to cross to Swan River as soon
as he can make the necessary arrangements. We have been favoured
with the following narrative of his recent trip to Fitz Roy
Downs.</p>
<p>An account of a journey to the westward of Darling Downs,
undertaken with the view of examining the country between Sir
Thomas Mitchell's track and my own.</p>
<p>I <span class="u">started</span> from Mr. H. S. Russell's
station on the 9th of August last, accompanied by Mr. F. N.
Isaacs, Mr. Bunce, Mr. Perry, and my blackfellow. We followed the
dray track to Mr. Gogg's sheep station, at the head of Acacia
Creek, which is a tributary of Dogwood Creek. On the 15th we
travelled down Acacia Creek about 12 miles W.N.W.; on the 16th we
made Dogwood Creek at my old crossing-place, in latitude 26.24,
and continued for about 10 miles N.W. by west, following a small
creek up to its head, and coming to watercourses belonging to
another creek which I had called Bottle-tree Creek on my first
expedition. The country was scrubby with a few patches of open
forest; the latitude of our camp was 26.20. On the 17th we
followed the water-course down to Bottle-tree Creek, which was
well supplied with water: we crossed it and came on a fine rocky
creek with running water, about two miles W.S.W. from the latter;
the intervening country was however a rotten, rusty-gum forest,
with occasional patches of cypress pine and forest oak; we passed
another dry creek in the same course and came to a fine open flat
or undulating narrow-leaved ironbark forest, which seemed to
continue to the eastward; we encamped on a chain of fine
waterholes about twelve miles W.S.W. from our last camp. On the
18th we travelled about twelve miles and a half S.W.; two miles
and a half from our camp we came to a good sized creek, with the
water filtering through the sands and pebbles; in following it up
between hills and ledges of rock, we came on a table-land with
patches of scrubby underwood. To the S.W. there were other creeks
and gullies, which compelled us to keep to the southward to come
to a more open country. Here the bricklow scrub re-appeared,
which, with one exception, we had not seen since we left the left
side of Dogwood Creek. We entered upon a box flat, which widened
as we followed down its dry watercourse, in a southerly and even
south-easterly direction, and when the bricklow scrub, which
skirted the flat ceased and allowed us to travel to the S.W., we
passed for four miles over most beautiful open box ridges, well
grassed and perfectly sound; this open country extended to the
south-east as far as the eye could reach. In latitude 26.32 we
came to a fine creek, with very large ponds of permanent water,
surrounded with reeds, and with myal groves along its banks. The
open box forest to the westward of this creek made me believe
that I could proceed on a westerly course; but after a few miles
travelling we were checked by scrub, which pushed us to the
south-east, until we came back to the creek we had left; we
followed it down for a few miles and encamped in latitude 26.39.
The country to the left was still open, but to the right bricklow
scrub approached, very nearly the banks of the creek. The
waterholes, though well provided with water were all boggy and
our mules went rather without water than expose themselves to the
danger of being bogged. The creek turned to the south-east and
east-south-east. In travelling to the westward we soon entered
into a dense bricklow scrub, which continued for nine miles, when
the country again opened into fine box ridges and undulations. We
followed a small creek, well provided with waterholes, for about
four miles to the westward, when it turned to the southward, and
having crossed a ridge we came to another creek of the same
character, running N. and S. on which we camped, in latitude
26.43, having made about thirteen miles W.S.W. from our last
camp. One and a half miles to the westward of this creek we met
another small creek, and four miles farther we crossed a large
creek with high flood marks, and with high box ridges,
particularly on its right banks. I am inclined to believe that
the open box country of the four last mentioned creeks extends in
an easterly direction round the scrub we had crossed to the first
box creek, and in a southerly direction to a large creek or
river, which is formed by the combined Dogwood Creek and
Bottle-tree Creek. Soon after having crossed the largest of those
creeks, which we called "Emu Creeks," in consequence of numerous
tracks of emus on the young grass, we entered into bricklow
scrub, which became so dense, that after five miles scrubbing we
were glad to follow a very winding watercourse to the S.E.; it
enlarged into a chain of large deep water-holes, which seemed to
be the constant resort of numerous natives, who had constructed
their bark gunyas at most of them. Having followed it down for
six or seven miles we encamped in latitude 26.48. This creek
continues for ten miles S.S.E. before it meets Dogwood Creek. It
becomes rocky; the country opens; but the ground is rotten, and
timbered with cypress pine, forest oak, and apple tree, which is
here anything but the indication of a good country. The scrub
ceases about two and a half miles above the junction. Here we
turned to the westward, and travelled three miles, when we came
to the deep channel of a large creek, with flood marks above the
banks; the latter wore frequently formed by perpendicular rocks;
the bed was sandy, and rather boggy, in consequence of the slight
stream of water which was filtering through the sands. A small
narrow-leaved tea-tree was growing along the water's edge.
Cypress pine and white gum formed a tolerably open forest; we
camped on the right bank of this creek, in latitude 26.55. Mr.
Bunce, and my blackfellow, who had gone to shoot ducks, did not
come up to our camp that night, nor the next morning, and fearing
that some accident had happened, I returned to the winding creek
we had left. The following morning the absentees joined us, and
explained their absence, by having come on the fresh tracks of
another party, which they followed until they observed the want
of mules' tracks, which induced them to return to the place where
they had left us. They had seen a great number of natives,
amongst whom they recognized a blackfellow and his gin, by a
white spot which the latter had on her neck. These two had
visited us in our camp at Charley's Creek, when starring for Peak
Range. At that time many natives from the Balonne passed
Charley's Creek to go to the Bunya Bunya. We now travelled down
the little creek to its junction with Dogwood Creek, and followed
the latter for one and a half miles, where the large sandy creek
joined it. Below this junction Dogwood Creek increases very much
in size, and the high flood-marks on the box trees that cover the
flats indicate the large body of water which sweeps down its
channel during the rainy season. We continued on our westerly
course and left the river, which takes a turn to the southward;
but bricklow scrub and sandstone gullies compelled us to south a
little and we encamped on a small scrubby creek, about ten miles
W. by S. from the junction of Sandy Creek. For the next eleven
miles to the westward we travelled over a scrubby myal country,
with patches of open puffy ironbark forest and of cypress pine.
At this stage we saw a conspicuous hill to the southward. We came
to a river from the northward, with high but irregular bunks,
lined with large water gum; its bed was sandy, containing pebbles
of fossil wood, broken pieces of agate, and variously coloured
flint and quartz; it was overgrown with tea-tree and was well
provided with water holes. Judging from its size its course could
not be less than 180 miles, and the presence of the fossil Wood
and of agate made us believe that, it came from a downs country.
I was inclined to think, that it was my Robinson's Creek, which I
had crossed in latitude 25.30, about ninety miles above our
present crossing place. The country along its banks was closely
timbered with box and box saplings. Here we saw the tracks of
five horses coming from tho westward and apparently passing down
the river. Fourteen miles to the west of this river which we
distinguished by the name of "Horsetrack River," we came to a
large creek trending to the S.E. the intervening country is
generally scrubby; occasional patches of open forest are very
puffy. In this puffy ground, near clusters of cypress pine, we
observed the deep burrows of a probably unknown animal. The
entrance is a large hole, four or five feet deep, from the bottom
of which the burrow passes horizontally under ground. It was
about one and a-half foot in diameter, and would indicate an
animal of the size of the beaver. Its tracks resembled those of a
child two or three years old, according to the observations of my
companions; its dung resembled that of the kangaroo, and
indicated a herbivorous animal. The creek was lined with
water-gum and tea-tree, and was well provided with large reedy
water-holes. My companions called it "the Yahoo River," which
name I shall adopt to distinguish it from the other creeks. At
night, when we were sitting round our fire, we heard a loud
shrill "pish-sh-sh," the disagreeable call of a night bird;
Wommai, my black-fellow, watched it and succeeded in shooting it.
It proved to be a beautiful little owl, a species of cyclops. Ten
miles west of the Yahoo, we crossed another large creek, with
large reedy water-holes in its sandy bed. The intervening country
is covered with a nasty cypress pine and dodonea scrub. When seen
from the westward of the large creek, which I shall call
"Frederick's Creek," it appears in form of a low range. The
approaches from the eastward of the creek are fine and open. We
continued our course to the westward for ten miles over sandy
ridges, covered with most wretched cypress pine scrub, and came
to a large creek with reedy waterholes and sandy bed, which I
shall call "Bunce's Creek." Its direction was from N.W. to S.E.
The slopes towards the creek were openly timbered with box;
beyond it we saw a long range extending from N. to S.; we crossed
it in latitude 26.59. Scarcely two miles to the westward we came
to sandstone ridges which were covered with scrub composed of
cypress pine, dodonea, and bricklow, and which extended fully ten
miles to the westward. Here another species of acacia akin to the
bricklow formed a scrub worse than any we had yet met; dead
timber made the road extremely circuitous, and the progress slow,
and as it was frequently overgrown with thick underwood composed
of various interesting aromatic shrubs it became dangerous for
our mules and horses to pass through it. Being tired of an
apparently never-ceasing succession of these acacia ridges, we
followed a water-course W. 30 S. for about three or four miles,
when we found a good supply of water in a rocky waterhole.
Shortly after having encamped, three natives walked boldly up to
us, after having cooeed and having received our cooee in return;
Mr. Isaacs and myself met them about fifty yards from our camp to
ascertain if possible whether we were near the Colgoon, which we
expected soon to see&mdash;however they did not understand us,
but parted good friends, after having received three brass
buttons each; there was no doubt that they had seen white men
before. In coming down the little creek we had seen a fine plain
to the eastward, and when we left it and travelled to the
westward we passed over very fine open box ridges. Six miles from
the little creek, and about twenty miles W. of Bunce's Creek, we
came to a little river, with a deep but dry bed, though with some
ponds full of water parallel to it. The country continued open
for about three miles to the westward of it, but at that distance
a very scrubby mountainous country commenced; this river was the
Colgoon, we expected it, but not finding Sir Thomas Mitchell's
track, I supposed I was out in my reckoning and determined to
push on to the westward until we came to the track. We passed for
seven miles over the scrubby mountains and were surprised to come
to a large creek which went to the northward, we camped on this
creek in latitude 27' and followed it for about four miles to the
northward; it preserved its mountainous character and we
consequently left it to continue to the westward. We travelled
for sixteen miles over a succession of acacia ridges, and creeks,
which turned all to the N.E. and E.N.E. to join the North Creek,
and some of these creek had patches of very fine box and myal
country. At that distance we met a water-course going S.S.W.,
which we followed for about ten miles before we came to water,
and that only after having camped a night without it. From a fine
rocky waterhole of this little creek we travelled about two miles
to the westward, when we found ourselves on Sir Thomas Mitchell's
returning tracks, and Mr. Kennedy's three cart tracks outward
bound. About five miles to the northward we came to camp 80, and
cammed on a little creek with good water-holes, in lat. 26.53. We
continued to follow the tracks of Kennedy to lat. 26.35 passed
his camp 79; examined the country along a small creek joining the
river at that camp; returned on our tracks to the place where we
first had met Sir Thomas Mitchell's tracks, and followed them
down to lat. 27.30, passing his camp 81. Between these two camps,
which are very nearly 40 miles distant from each other, we had to
camp without water, and Mr. Kennedy seems to have shared the some
fate, for we saw that he had tried to obtain it by digging in the
sandy bed of the creek. After having seen sixty miles of Sir
Thomas Mitchell's track, and finding that the country did not
agree with his description of Fitz Roy Downs, we concluded that
we were on the Maranoa, and that the little river we had crossed
was really the Colgoon.</p>
<p>We now returned to the eastward, to make the Balonne, to trace
this river up to the junction of Dogwood Creek and the Condamine,
and to ascertain where those various creeks I and rivers we had
crossed joined the main stream. We travelled, for eighteen miles
through a thick bricklow scrub, with a few interruptions of open
ground, and came at that distance from the Maranoa to a chain of
fine large ponds. About three miles farther we found the Balonne.
All the' hollows, the flats, the gullies along the river, had
been covered with water, and the floodmarks were visible full
five feet above its highest banks. Its course was from N.E. by N.
to S.W. by S. We passed the junction of a deep creek or gully,
and camped in latitude 27.24, in tolerably open country. About
three miles to the northward we saw Sir Thomas's tracks, leaving
the river, but they were generally very faint. In lat. 27.18
(appr.) a large creek joined the Balonne, and we supposed that
this was the Colgoon; it was gently running, according to Mr.
Isaacs. The country below the junction of this creek is open, and
by far the best we have seen along the right bank of the river'
Above the Colgoon it is generally closely wooded, with some open
patches, but the latter are generally puny. From the junction of
the Colgoon to the junction of Sandy Creek the Balonne runs from
E.N.E.-W.S.W., with wide bends to the southward. Our second camp
from the Balonne was in latitude 27.17. About twenty-four miles
from the junction of the Colgoon, up the river, another large
creek joins it. It comes from N. 35 E., and corresponds to
Bunce's Creek and Frederick's Creek, which very probably join
before meeting the Balonne. Six miles below and two miles above
this creek we saw trees marked with an H. Sixteen miles from this
creek a third large creek joins the Balonne; this we supposed to
be the Yahoo; twelve miles above this we passed the junction of
tho Horsetrack River, and,25-30 miles higher we were again at the
junction of Sandy Creek. Between these two rivers, about eight to
ten miles below Sandy Creek, Mr. Bunce and Wommai had observed
the junction of a large creek from the left side, and I suppose
that this is the Condamine, which has been followed down by Mr.
Coxen and, Pinnock, and by Mr. O'Connor, to its junction with
Dogwood Creek. We followed Dogwood Creek up to lat. 26.56,
crossed it, and travelled about eleven miles E. by N., when we
came again on one of its bends to the southward in lat. 26.53.
Here we found a fine open box country, but with veins of puffy
ground. In continuing the course E. by N. we passed over some
very fine country and came to the Condamine on a very remarkable
bend, below which we found the letter B. Three miles higher up
the river we camped in 26.49. We travelled about nine miles east
when we came again to the river, which had made a large bend to
the northward; we crossed it, continued about seven miles to the
eastward, and approached the river a second time. We had just
encamped, when my blackfellow heard the neighing of a horse; a
gun was immediately fired, which was answered by the crack of a
stock whip, and shortly afterwards Mr. Ewer came up to us, and
gave us the agreeable intelligence that we were near his station.
We had seen numerous cattle tracks several miles below the place,
and were sure that a station was close at hand.</p>
<p>On my return to Sydney Captain Perry kindly permitted me the
inspection of Sir Thomas Mitchell's map. I find that my
suppositions have been correct. His Fitz Roy Downs commence about
ten-fifteen miles above the place where we crossed the Colgoon.
He could not have Been the River Balonne to the east of his
Grafton Range, when he was standing on Mount Abundance; it was
very probably Bunce's Creek, I am inclined to believe that
similar patches of open country exist on the heads of Bunce's
Creek, Frederick's Creek, Yahoo River, Horse-track River, and
perhaps even of Sandy Creek, but I do not think that they form an
uninterrupted belt of downs above the scrubs of their lower
course. A dray road will be found practicable in the dry season
from Mitchell's track along the Balonne and the Condamine (which
is one of its principal heads), to Mr. Ewer's station and Darling
Downs. Should stations be formed on the heads of these various
creeks the respective roads will have to follow down the creek,
and join the main road along the Balonne, which will be rendered
extremely circuitous, and difficult by numerous gullies,
back-waters, and deep creeks, which join that river. The stations
will become very isolated in consequence of those broad belts of
scrubby country intervening between the creeks. The natives
appear to form powerful tribes along the Balonne and its numerous
lagoons, and would be dangerous enemies along the scrubs, which
would allow them a secure retreat from their aggressions.
Considering the long and precarious land carriage, and the high
rate of wages, particularly in so remote stations, I do not
believe that sheep-farming will pay even as far as the
Horse-track River. Cattle stations might be formed perhaps even
as far as Maranoa, which at camp 80 of Sir Thomas would be very
eligible for the purpose. But the road from that camp to Maitland
will in all probability be found shorter than that to Moreton
Bay. I shall add a few distances, but I beg to remark that my
distances from Mr. Ewer's station down the Condamine and the
Balonne are estimated as straight lines, which, in a dray-road
might be occasionally doubled. The distance from Brisbane to the
Wool-shed is about 150 miles, from the Wool-shed to Mr. Ewer's 46
miles, from Mr. Ewer's to the B at the horse-shoe bend of the
Condamine about 23 miles, from the B to Sandy River 28 miles,
from the Sandy River to Horsetrack River 25-30 miles, from the
Horsetrack River to the Yahoo River about 12 miles, from the
Yahoo River to Frederick Creek and the H about 16 miles, from the
Frederick's Creek to the junction of the Colgoon 24 miles, from
the junction of the Colgoon up to Fitz Roy Downs, between 40-50
miles. The distance from Brisbane to the junction of the Colgoon
with the Balonne would be, according to this estimate, 332 miles;
but the dray-road will prove to he, at least, 400 miles.</p>
<p>It is to be expected that creeks, corresponding to those from
the northward, will join the Balonne from the south and
south-east, taking their rise in the Mackentire Ranges; and I
have heard that Mr. O'Connor has already succeeded in finding a
fine run on one of them.</p>
<p>Should the country of Peak Range be settled upon, Sir Thomas
Mitchell's track will no doubt form the road on which stock will
move up to the latitude of that locality, and will then turn to
the eastward; my track is too mountainous and scrubby for a
dray-road, and I myself shall very probably choose Sir Thomas's
track on my next starting to the westward.</p>
<p>In judging the country I have seen, I have availed myself of
the experience of Mr. Frederick Isaacs, who has such a large
share in the exploration of Darling Downs and its confines. I
shall take this opportunity of giving my best thanks to him, to
Mr. Bunce, and to Mr. Perry, for their kind assistance in this
expedition. I am personally obliged to Mr. Bunce for a fine
collection of seeds and plants, which he made, not only on this
occasion, but on my journey to Peak Range. Mr. Boecking, another
of my companions to Peak Range, though most willing to accompany
me to the Colgoon, had been compelled to return from the
Wool-shed in consequence of an attack of fever; I feel bound to
recommend him, as well as Mr. Perry, to every one who should wish
to employ them, for their unimpeachable moral conduct, for their
unceasing activity and intelligence; and though they, as well as
Mr. Bunce, are inclined to share my fate again on my next
expedition, and though I should be happy to have the company of
men who have stood the trial, I should be sorry for their joining
me if better prospects were open to them.</p>
<p>In the extract of my letter published in the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>, it is stated that Sir Thomas crossed my track at
Expedition Range; this is a mistake, he crossed Expedition Range
to the westward of my track.</p>
<p>I shall annex here a series of observations on the elevation
of various points along the road from Port Stephens to Peak
Range. They are made with the boiling-water apparatus which the
Rev. W. B. Clarke had the kindness to lend me on this
expedition:</p>

<p>In travelling from the junction of the Comet River with the
Mackenzie to Peak Range I followed the Mackenzie up to one of its
heads and ascertained that the waters which drain from Peak Range
to the S. and S.W., collected into the channel of that river;
those to the N.W. and W. very probably belong to the system of
the Belyando of Mitchell, or of my Cape. On the upper part of the
Mackenzie, which is well watered, we passed over large plains and
downs of the existence of which I had not been aware. They extend
about sixty miles from S.S.E. to N.N.W. and are frequently six to
eight miles broad, they are however hemmed in by scrubby country
to the west, to the south, and to the east.</p>
<p>In concluding these remarks I shall add the agreeable
intelligence that five of tho seven mules which I lost at Peak
Range have made their appearance at Darling Downs, after having
travelled six hundred miles by themselves, and have been duly
secured by the stockmen of Mr. Gogg and young Mr. Headley, to
whom I feel deeply obliged for their exertions.</p>
