<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>PART I. THE BIRTH OF THOUGHT</h2>

<p class="cpb">I.</p>

<p>MR. NELSON SMOCK, arriving at his cottage in Maine on Friday
afternoon for his weekly recuperation from Wall Street, paused in
the hall and looked into the living room before going on in search
of his wife. His four children, three daughters and a son, were in
the room; but none of them paid any attention to him or even seemed
aware of his presence.</p>

<p>This was because of their absorbing interest in a girl of
eighteen who sat upon a sofa facing the doorway, chattering to
them. She was a stranger to him, and his absent-minded definition
for her was, "just another of these summer flappers." He meant
nothing intolerant; his own daughters probably were listed under
that head in the minds of casual observers, he supposed; and he
felt no disapproval of the young lady on the sofa, though he did
wish that his children might so far break the thraldom in which she
held them as to give him at least a greeting.</p>

<p>Only one of them, however, so much as turned a wandering eye in
his direction. This was his son, Nelson, a serious sophomore. Young
Nelson glanced toward the doorway, and undoubtedly his eye
perceived that his father stood there; but with this the youth's
perception appeared to stop; there was no evidence that the optic
nerve conveyed any information to the brain, and the eye returned
with a visible ardour to the young lady upon the sofa. The father
was a little disappointed; he felt that he worked hard to keep his
children bountifully supplied with all they asked for, and it
seemed to him that they might well show enough appreciation to
welcome him after his five days of absence. He realized, of course,
that it was customary for them to see him return on Friday
afternoon; that they were used to both his absence and his
presence, as well as to himself and everything he could do for
them; whereas, on the other hand, the young lady upon the sofa was
a newcomer in their society and evidently appeared to them as a
sparkling novelty. Wondering why they thought her important, he
looked again at her, but discovered no more than he had before: she
seemed indistinguishable from a hundred others.</p>

<p>What he saw was a comely, childlike little face, pink and thin
and piquant, with light-brown hair cut short upon the back of the
head, but elsewhere left three or four inches long and waved. As
for the rest of her, there was a childlike body in a close,
revealing, pale-green silk tunic that left her arms bare from the
shoulder and her legs apparently bare from just above the knees
down to her sleek white slippers, which had three-inch heels. This
latter nudity was only an illusion, however; for thin silk
stockings, as near the colour of her skin as possible, almost
impalpably protected her; but she was inconsistent enough to seem
desirous of more protection. From time to time she mechanically
pulled at the small skirt of her tunic to bring it down over the
exposed knees&mdash;a manifest absurdity, since the skirt, when sat
upon, had no such elastic possibilities. Plainly, this was only a
gesture and an inherited one, an ancestral memory or instinct alive
in the race long after the use for it has gone.</p>

<p>She had other gestures, too&mdash;a great many of them; some
with arms and hands, some with her shoulders and back, some even
with her feet; and all of her constant motion was immature and
impulsive, or at least so it seemed to a middle-aged observation
from the doorway. Yet she was not lacking in an April-like young
grace nor in a youthful shapeliness; but that was all the owner of
the cottage could see&mdash;except the cigarette airily waved in
her thin young hand as she chattered. He was not favourably
impressed by the cigarette; but his daughters were smoking, too;
and he knew he had nothing useful to say, or even to think, about
that. As for the young creature's chatter, he could make nothing of
it at all; so he gave up this momentary problem and went on in
search of his wife. When he found her, not five minutes later, in a
garden behind the house, the picture of the girl on the sofa was
already merged in his mind with dozens of other new memories, all
insignificant, and he did not even ask who she was.</p>

<p>So lightly did the man over fifty almost instantly set aside as
trivial what had become the most important thing in the life of his
only and treasured son. Young Nelson sat upon a stool and looked
humbly up to a beglamoured and honoured sofa that was to him the
seat of all beauty, grace, and wit made incarnate and gloriously
visible. For three roseate days he had known the incomparable
damsel, Claire Ambler, and although both of them had at first been
formal, not calling each other by their first names until their
acquaintance was well along toward half an hour old, Nelson was
sure, by the morning of the third day, that he had fallen in love
at sight. Now that it was afternoon and he had been for hours aware
of his passion, he saw only wonders before him, with no
imperfection anywhere.</p>

<p>In this he bore some resemblance to the girl upon the sofa; for
she saw no imperfection in herself. Yet no one thought her
egotistical; she often spoke of her faults, though without naming
them. On the other hand, she saw no definite perfections in
herself; in fact, she had no appraisement of herself either the one
way or the other, and it may truly be said that she did not think
about herself. Probably it would be as true to say that neither did
she think about other people, nor about anything. She had feelings
that she believed to be thoughts; she had likes and dislikes that
she believed to be thoughts; she had impulses she believed to be
thoughts; her mind was full of shifting and flying pictures that
she believed to be thoughts; it was also full of echoes of what she
had heard and read, and these she usually believed to be thoughts
original with her. Words were fluent upon her lips without her
knowing or wondering how they got there; yet she was sure they
expressed truths and she easily became angry, or grieved, if they
were challenged.</p>

<p>She knew what she did, but not why she did it; though she was
ready with reasons, and could even less well bear a challenge to
her conduct than one to her words. Thus, at seventeen, when she had
her long and beautiful tresses shorn away, she was irritated with
her mother for lamenting. Her hair was cut off, Claire said,
because ridding herself of such a burden was "sensible"; and she
believed this, not knowing that she bore the civilized
disfigurement merely because it was borne by other maidens of the
tribe, as mechanical and unwitting as herself. Again, she had been
irritated with her father when he questioned the scantiness of her
skirt; for this brevity, too, was "sensible," she said, being once
more unaware that she had no motive except to follow the fashion of
her kind, and did but manifest a mob contagion.</p>

<p>It seemed to her a long, long time since she had been a child,
so long that she now had little interest in children&mdash;not much
more than she had in old people&mdash;and both children and old
people, like workingmen in flivvers, she felt, belonged to the
duller and rather annoying classes. The only interesting persons in
the world were of about her own age; in fact they were the only
people who seemed to her actually alive; and yet even they were not
wholly alive in the full sense that she herself was. That is to
say, the universe consisted of herself and of impressions made upon
her. All other people, varying dimnesses and brightnesses, belonged
among the impressions. There were tombstones in the cemeteries just
as there were names and dates in books of history; but there could
have been no actual life, such as she knew in herself, until she
came upon the earth. All had been darkness until her perceptions
began to inform her that she was alive, and even her own childhood
now seemed shadowy. Full, broad light had not shone until a
comparatively recent time, when she was about sixteen. And at that,
all parts of the earth, except the spot where she was, had still
but a vague illumination. She did not really believe that the sun
was radiant over China while she slept.</p>

<p>To honest young Nelson, worshipping her, she seemed a living
being, indeed; but to her Nelson was a pleasantly coloured shape
that made more or less agreeable noises. His present expression,
however, was entirely agreeable to her, and she was in a degree
aware of its yearning significance. She was not wholly aware of
what it meant, however, because she did not realize what his
feeling meant to Nelson himself; she had no concern with that, nor,
indeed, had she any perception of it. She was aware only that it
proved how effective her attraction was; it would be useful to her
at dances and elsewhere, and she hoped to produce similar
expressions upon the faces of other boys. Already she had
experience in the art of making them wear this look, and although
it was a look not always becoming to them and sometimes made them
obviously uncomfortable, it seemed to be, on the whole, the
principal thing for which Nature had intended them.</p>

<p class="cpb">II.</p>

<p>NELSON'S father had failed to comprehend the interest of the
group of young people in what he thought of as the girlish chatter
from the sofa. It seemed to him that just as she looked like any
other "summer flapper," so also did she chatter like any other
little creature of her kind; and in this he had no perception of
how "original" and special an individual his children and their
friends were finding her. This was to be her first season here; but
she had spent summers at other resorts, and was giving them a
lively account of the important people of these places. She had
intimately known several celebrities of the first water&mdash;one
of them, indeed, was a captain at Nelson's university&mdash;and so,
to these listeners, she spoke of grandees of their own world. If
Mr. Smock and some of his contemporaries had occupied the living
room and young Nelson had come in to find them listening to an
elderly stranger gossiping briskly of important financiers, the boy
would have thought the session as dismal as it was inexplicable,
and perhaps might have wondered how old men all contrived to look
so much alike. He had never in his life seen a girl in the least
like Claire Ambler, he was sure; never had he heard a voice so
golden; never had he met a woman with so large an experience of the
world; never had he been dazzled by so much brilliancy of mind.</p>

<p>He tried to express his bedazzlement as he walked home with her
to her cottage in the late afternoon sunshine. "You cert'n'y gave
us all a good time," he said seriously. "I couldn't begin to tell
you the kick I got out of it myself."</p>

<p>"How?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; but anyhow I did. It's kind of like
something new coming into our lives here, or something like that. I
mean the way you talk; or what I mean, I mean the way you say
things. You got a way of saying things that's kind of got a kick in
it. Anyhow, for me it has, I mean."</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely, seeming much interested; but for a
time made no response; and, at intervals bumping into each other
slightly, they walked slowly on over the uneven country road.</p>

<p>"I mean it," he said. "Honest, I really do mean it. I mean
there's lots of kick in what you say."</p>

<p>She pulled a leaf from a hedge, put the stem between her lips,
frowned as in perplexity; then asked: "How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I mean there is. I don't mean it's only in the
way you say what you say; there's more to it than that. F'r
instance, when you say something, you say it in a way that's got a
kick in it; but I mean what you got to say's got a kick in it too.
You see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said thoughtfully, and gave him a meek
glance. "Do you mean you don't like the way I say things,
Nelson?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he protested, troubled to have given her this
harsh impression. "I mean just the opposite. I mean I like it so
much I get a big kick out of it. Honestly."</p>

<p>"Honestly?" she repeated; and the word seemed important to her.
"Honestly, Nelson?"</p>

<p>He was distressed and also a little aggrieved by what might have
implied a doubt of him. "I don't know what cause I've ever given
you," he said, "not to believe in my sincerity."</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean that, Nelson. I was only trying to get at
just what you meant."</p>

<p>"I see," he returned, mollified. "I wouldn't like to think you
doubted my sincerity, because I think if you aren't sincere you
just about as well mightn't be anything at all. Don't you believe
in sincerity, Claire?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do. If one isn't genuine, then what <i>is</i>
one?"</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed. "That's what I mean. I mean when you say
things like that. I mean that's when I get a kick out of the way
you say 'em and out of what you're saying too. Don't you understand
what I mean, Claire?"</p>

<p>Strangely enough, she still seemed to be a little uncertain. "I
didn't talk too much at your cottage, did I? Of course, as it was
the first time I've been there, and just meeting your sisters,
perhaps you think I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Nelson interrupted earnestly. "They were nuts over
you, absolutely nuts! I knew they would be. You're altogether
differ'nt from the rest o' these girls around here, Claire, and
that's why."</p>

<p>"That's why what, Nelson?"</p>

<p>"It's why they're so nuts over you," he explained. "What I mean,
I mean, well, you've had so much more experience of life than they
have. You've been around lots more places, and about all
<i>they</i> ever been is just this one old place&mdash;and home, of
course, and school, and maybe a trip abroad or somewheres. But what
I mean about you, Claire, it wouldn't do 'em any good, prob'ly, if
they <i>had</i> been around like you have. What I mean, they
wouldn't know how to take in things the way you have. The trouble
with them is they wouldn't know how to. You see what I mean, don't
you, Claire?"</p>

<p>"I'm not exactly sure," she said. "But I suppose prob'ly that
<i>is</i> the trouble with a certain amount of people. Do you know
what I believe is the trouble with most people?"</p>

<p>"What is?" he asked solicitously, almost breathlessly; for her
tone was deeply serious, and he felt that matters of grave import
were before them. "I've often thought about it; but I never did get
it worked out in my mind to suit me just right. You can see that
most people <i>have</i> got something the matter with 'em; but you
can't tell exactly what it is. What do you believe it is,
Claire?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've thought about it a great deal, too," she said. "I
used to feel it was a question there'd never be any answer to; and
sometimes it would make me&mdash;oh, I used to get absolutely
morbid about it!"</p>

<p>"Did you?" he said gently, touched by the depth of her
conscientiousness. "I never got that way about it myself, prob'ly
because I haven't got a deep enough nature. You don't any more, do
you Claire?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Not about that, anyhow, because I'm older now
and I think I've worked out the answer."</p>

<p>"Have you? How?"</p>

<p>"Well, princip'ly by observation."</p>

<p>"I think that's wonderful," he said. "What was the answer,
Claire?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's this," she said, and they walked more slowly. "I
believe the trouble with most people is, they never think."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I just don't understand their not doing it;
but if you turn over the people you know in your mind, how many of
them can you find that ever really think?"</p>

<p>Nelson became emphatic, as in a great enlightenment. "By golly,
I believe you're right! I believe you've got it worked
out&mdash;that <i>is</i> the trouble with most people. They
<i>don't</i> think."</p>

<p>"It's so strange," Claire murmured, a little sadly. "You'd think
they <i>would</i> think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they don't," Nelson said. "That's the trouble with 'em;
they don't think."</p>

<p>At this she appealed to him, as to a superior wisdom. "Why is
it, Nelson? I've wondered so much about that. You're a man, and you
ought to be able to tell me. Why is it they don't think?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's prob'ly because they won't take the
trouble to. Either that, or maybe because they simply don't know
how."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," she returned, and she gave him a quick
little glance of deferential appreciation. "I think that's rather a
wonderful idea, Nelson. Only a person that does think could work
out an explanation like that."</p>

<p>Nelson's colour heightened, he was so pleased to believe her
kind opinion of him warranted. It seemed to him that this was a
beautiful walk he was taking in delicious air and sunshine with a
companion who understood with him the deeper things of life, the
things that he really cared for. "The way I look at it is simply
this," he said. "The trouble with most people is they don't even
realize there <i>is</i> such a thing as thinking. So&mdash;well,
when you get with a person that does think, well, you get a kick
out of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed thoughtfully. "I think that's true."</p>

<p>"Of course it's true," he said; and he went on: "That's what I
meant about the way you were talking, up at the cottage. I knew you
were a girl that does think, and you don't often meet with one that
does, because what do the ordinary run of 'em care for? What do
they talk about? Why, nothing but what they <i>do</i> talk
about&mdash;just all this and that, till you get absolutely sick of
listening to 'em. All in the world they got to go on is simply
their sex appeal, and in the long run what does that amount to? All
you got to do is analyze it to see it doesn't amount to anything
more than just a part of their maternity instinct, and you get
awful tired of it. What I mean, you take two people that got more
than mere sex appeal, and suppose they meet in a place like this,
the way I've met you here, Claire, well, I mean there ought to be a
pretty good kick in it." He paused, and then, with increased
earnestness, he added, "I don't care for <i>anything</i> that
hasn't got a kick in it. Do you feel that way, too, Claire?"</p>

<p>She inclined her head gravely, assenting. "Yes; I think life
isn't worth living, practic'ly, unless you get a kick out of
it."</p>

<p>"I knew you'd feel that way," Nelson said in a low voice. "I
knew you would." Then, emotional after the confirmation of this
affinity between them, he walked on in silence, believing that she
shared his feeling.</p>

<p>But here he pathetically failed in comprehension of his new
friend. Claire was wondering which of two dresses she would wear
that evening to a dance at the Beach Club; all the way from
Nelson's cottage, she had been trying to decide between them; she
was only secondarily aware of Nelson, though she had seemed to be
giving him a stirred attention. Her share of the conversation had
been not much more than the repetition of a familiar formula, yet
he found it anything but mechanical. For in this she was exercising
an art possessed and habitually practised by most of her sex.
Nelson's own mother used a variation of it frequently, at
breakfast, when she gave a perfect response to her husband's
discourse without listening to it or disturbing in the least the
housewifely planning that then always occupied her mind.</p>

<p>Without speaking again, the two young people reached the
driveway gate of the house Claire's father had leased for the
summer; and here they paused. "Well&mdash;" Nelson said, a little
huskily, for his emotion had not subsided but increased. "I suppose
we couldn't go on a little way farther? Prob'ly you want to go
in?"</p>

<p>"Want to?" she echoed, and, as she wished to look over the two
dresses before making a choice between them, she decided against
any prolongation of their walk. "I don't know why you should put it
that way, Nelson," she said. "One doesn't always do what one wants
to."</p>

<p>"But it isn't near dinnertime yet. If you do want to, I don't
see why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Men never see why," she said gently. "Because they can do what
they like with their own time, they always think a girl can."</p>

<p>He sighed. Her tone implied important duties that could not
honourably be evaded, no matter what her desires might be; and he
understood that her strong inclination was to extend their walk.
"Well," he said, "I wish you could; but if you can't&mdash;" He
leaned against one of the pillars of rough stone that served as
gate-posts. "Anyhow, I'm glad we've had this talk. There's not many
girls I'd care to talk to the way I do to you, Claire, because they
wouldn't understand. In the first place, what I mean, I
<i>wouldn't</i> talk to 'em the way I been talking to you, and in
the second place, if I did, they wouldn't understand what I
mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they would," she said generously. "Plenty of them
would, Nelson. You mustn't be so cynical."</p>

<p>"I'm not exactly cynical," he returned, much pleased. "But it's
true. I don't know another girl here that I'd talk to like this or
that'd understand what I mean if I did."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nelson! Not one?"</p>

<p>"Not a single one."</p>

<p>"Well, I do," she said. "Anyhow, if there aren't any around here
I've known girls other places that would."</p>

<p>He conceded a little. "Well, maybe there are girls other places
that would; but anyhow you're the only one here. That's the reason
I wanted to say something about&mdash;about&mdash;" He hesitated;
then went on: "Well, what I mean: You take two people that are the
only two people that understand each other in a place like this,
and that really care about the same things that the others don't
care about, well, what I mean, I think two people like that, if
they were at a dance like to-night f'r instance&mdash;and knew they
cared about the same things the way we do&mdash;well, we could walk
down to the rocks and sit there most of the time, if you'd like to.
I hope you'd like to as much as I would, Claire. Would you?"</p>

<p>His tone was wistful, yet not without confidence in a favourable
reply, for Nelson felt that a definite and exquisite tie had been
established between them. He was surprised and troubled, therefore,
when she did not immediately reply to his question; and after a few
moments he repeated it, a little huskily. "You would, wouldn't you,
Claire?"</p>

<p>Still she hesitated. That evening was to mark her first
appearance before a general collection of the younger summer
inhabitants of the place, and her ambition was by no means limited
to the capture of an individual. She wished Nelson to be an ardent
suitor for her favour, and by his ardour an incitement to
competition&mdash;in fact, a herald or advertiser for her; and she
hoped to be kept too busy, even this first evening, to leave the
dancing floor at all. But as the most useful diplomatic reply to
his question was difficult, she fell back upon a repetition of
something she had just used.</p>

<p>"Girls can't always do what they want to, Nelson."</p>

<p>"What?" He was puzzled. "Why, you could go down to the rocks
with me if you wanted to, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"But you could!"</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly. "No&mdash;not if I'd promised my
mother."</p>

<p>"But why should she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's old-fashioned, Nelson."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" he said, much depressed. "But anyhow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyhow we'll see a lot of each other," she interrupted
cheeringly, and she gave him a swift, bright look that lifted him
to a state of adequate consolation. "Gracious!" she cried. "If you
knew all I have to do!" And with that, she said, "G'by!" and
flitted lightly up the driveway, while he stood gazing after her in
precisely the fond condition she wished. She would see him again,
she knew, in about four hours; and she now economically put him out
of her conscious thought just as a cook who has set a dish in the
oven to bake for some similar length of time, puts it out of her
mind and turns to other matters. She went briskly to the selection
of her dress, while young Nelson, having watched her out of sight,
reverently picked a leaf from the ivy that climbed one of the
gateway pillars, and then walked slowly homeward, sighing dreamily.
He had lived a long time, he felt, much of it occupied with dreary
illusions; and at last he was not only in love, but had found a
nature that corresponded to his own. The great harmony had been
established between them: she cared for the same things that he
did.</p>

<p class="cpb">III.</p>

<p>HE WAS all the more in a sighing condition because of Claire's
devotion to the tasks that called her indoors. He understood them
to be useful and altruistic&mdash;perhaps aiding her mother with
household management, possibly performing secretarial duties for
her father; at any rate, something better than the occupations of
his sisters, who never did anything, he was convinced, except for
themselves. Everything about this girl was beautifully admirable;
hers was a deeper nature than that of other girls; and she was so
conscientious that she wouldn't even break a promise unreasonably
extorted by the old-fashioned prejudices of her mother. Nelson
recognized a noble loyalty; but he was a little gloomy about it,
too. He had a foreboding of rivalry; there were three or four
dashing contemporaries of his whom Claire had not met; and it was
partly with them in mind that he had suggested the departure to the
rocks. In particular, he felt an uneasiness about the effect upon
her of two of his close friends.</p>

<p>Platter Thomas and Bill Reek were "all right among men," Nelson
thought; but he did not like their manners with girls. Platter and
Bill were too informal; they were boisterous, coarse-grained,
off-hand; and they were incapable of making fine distinctions; they
would not understand that Claire Ambler wasn't the kind of person
one slaps on the back. He had seen Platter and Bill presented to a
girl on the beach and immediately take her into the surf and hold
her under water as a means of establishing, without intermediate
tediums, a proper camaraderie. The fact that girls seemed to be
flattered by the attentions of the boorish pair, Nelson attributed
to a swift and commodious motorboat, their joint property. The
motorboat would not dazzle a girl who had seen so much of the world
as Claire had, he thought; and yet her very conscientiousness might
prevent her from declining invitations. Moreover, Platter and Bill
would be certain to tell her about the boat as soon as they met
her;&mdash;they never failed to drag in an apparently casual
mention of it, and he had a premonition that he was going to find
them annoying.</p>

<p>Herein he was a true prophet; they were so annoying, in fact,
that he spoke of them to Claire before the evening was half over,
and he showed feeling: "I s'pose they been bragging to you about
that old tub o' theirs," he said severely, as he danced with her.
"They never meet anybody new they don't begin right away to
blah-blah about it. I hope you didn't flatter 'em by seeming to
take any interest in it&mdash;I mean after this afternoon."</p>

<p>"After this afternoon, Nelson?" she asked vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "You know. I mean our caring for the same
things. You know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she returned quickly. "Of course."</p>

<p>"You meant it, didn't you, Claire?"</p>

<p>"Meant what?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you know. I mean about our caring for the same
things. Didn't you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Nelson."</p>

<p>"Well, since we found that out, don't you think it makes a
difference? What I mean: when two people care for the same things,
why, I shouldn't think one of 'em would seem so excited about
meeting a lot of new men, and look in their eyes, and seem so eager
and pleased when they cut in when we're dancing together and
everything like that. What I mean: if I didn't remember this
afternoon, the way you been behaving to-night I wouldn't even know
we <i>did</i> care for the same things."</p>

<p>"But we do, Nelson."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said reproachfully, "I think you might act more
like it, Claire. The way you been acting to-night I wouldn't know
whether you cared for the same things or just never thought about
anything in the world except mere sex appeal. You haven't promised
you'll go out in their old boat with 'em yet, have you?"</p>

<p>"Promised who?"</p>

<p>"Platter Thomas and Bill Reek."</p>

<p>"Which ones are they, Nelson? I've met so many and I get their
names mixed up."</p>

<p>At this he was relieved. "Well, I'm glad you do," he said. "So
you haven't."</p>

<p>"Haven't what?"</p>

<p>"Haven't said you'd go out in their boat."</p>

<p>"Let me see." A slight frown, as of perplexity, appeared upon
her pretty brow. "There were three boys who asked me to motor with
them, and one to go canoeing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" Nelson interrupted. "You didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, remembering. "And there were two that
talked about motorboating. One wanted me to go to-morrow morning
and the other in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Listen!" Nelson said. "You didn't promise you would, did
you?"</p>

<p>Surprised, she looked up at his flushed and troubled face.
"Well, they all seem so nice and cordial&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All?" he gasped. "All! D'you mean you're going to do what
<i>all</i> of 'em asked you to? After this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"But you don't want me to snub people, do you, Nelson? Just when
they're anxious to be friendly and make me feel at home in a
strange place?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said. "You mean you told <i>all</i> of 'em you
<i>would</i>?"</p>

<p>"But what else could I do, Nelson?"</p>

<p>Nelson looked desperate. "You did, then! After this afternoon!
You said we care for the same things and then you go ahead and get
yourself all dated up like this!"</p>

<p>"But Nelson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's terrible," he said. "It's a terrible thing."</p>

<p>"But we do care for the same things, Nelson, don't you believe
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, if we do, what makes you go and date yourself up
for all this&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here he was unpleasantly interrupted. A muscular hand
descended heartily upon his shoulder; Mr. Platter Thomas was
"cutting in," and claimed the lady for his partner in the dance.
Nelson was left with a sense of injury and no answer to an
incomplete question. The sense of injury seemed to be located at
first at a point in his lower throat; later, it spread to his
chest, and then progressing rapidly, saturated his whole person.
Breathing heavily, he determined to "cut in" himself, and insist
upon a direct reply; but in this resolve he was anticipated by
competitors. Indeed, he was thrice forestalled; and, when his
chance came again, he had no more than said, "Listen! If we do care
for the same things&mdash;" before another brisk slap on the
shoulder warned him that his time was over.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate; he had bestowed his affections upon one who
almost instantaneously became the outstanding belle of that sector
of the New England coast. Claire was seldom able to dance more than
the full length of the room without a change of partners, and, from
Nelson's point of view, the worst thing about this was her visible
enjoyment of an odious popularity. Flushed, laughing, radiant, she
turned sparkling eyes to every new applicant, even though he might
be one of the mere loutish hobbledehoys of sixteen who cluttered
the floor instead of being kept at home and sent to bed, as they
should have been, Nelson thought.</p>

<p>"Pups!" he muttered, watching two of these pursuing to "cut in,"
while a third danced rapidly away with her, evading them and
evading Nelson too. "Pups!" And he said worse of them: "Mere filthy
pups!"</p>

<p>For gradually, as the evening wore away, his disposition became
soured. Whenever he was able to dance with her for more than a
moment, he tried to obtain an answer to his question. "Claire,
after this afternoon&mdash;" he would begin, and once that was as
far as he got with it. Again, later, he said, "But if we <i>do</i>
care for the same things, Claire&mdash;" and as she interrupted him
there to say, "But you know we do, Nelson," he found only time to
add, "Then why don't you act more like it?" She was not put to the
trouble of a reply, as the noisy young Mr. Reek intervened.</p>

<p>True, as Nelson stood against the wall while she danced by with
others, she would often give him a lovely, wistful glance. "Don't
you <i>know</i> we care for the same things?" this tender quick
look seemed to say. But he had begun to doubt her seriously, and at
last, stung by a little mistake of hers, he decided to hold himself
aloof. This mistake was of no great importance, except to Nelson;
she was so careless as not to observe until too late that he was
standing beside his former friend, Mr. Thomas, and as she danced by
them, she flashed to Platter one of those lovely little glances
identically wistful. For an instant Nelson thought himself the
recipient; then the fatuous expression of Platter and Claire's
slight confusion were together all too enlightening.</p>

<p>Immediately Nelson became more completely than ever a mechanism.
That is to say, of course, he was like any other human being under
the impulsion of strong feelings, a stoked engine compelled to
motion. The metal engine will move as long as the fuel lasts; the
engine of human appearance will move as long as the feeling lasts;
and the difference is that the metal engine is (except for
accident) guided by human intelligence while the human engine is
not. Nevertheless, just as rails are provided for the metal engine,
so are there tracks that the human engine must follow&mdash;tracks
thus travelled for thousands of years by the mechanical humans
stoked by common emotions. To Nelson it appeared that of his own
choice he became haughty and indifferent to Claire; he believed
that he selected this manner himself; for he had no means of
knowing that this and his subsequent performances, as well, were
only the operations of a machine running inevitably along over
tracks so worn that they are among the most ancient.</p>

<p>Thus, running smoothly on rails&mdash;though in his own belief
the way was rough and painful&mdash;he danced no more that night
with Claire, nor so much as looked at her, nor bade her even the
most frigid or careless good-night, nor any good-night at all; but
in his own mind said farewell to her definitely and for ever. He
would have nothing more to do with a girl who had only pretended to
care for the same things that he did; and, to make her fully aware
of his indifference to her, on the following morning, he risked his
life.</p>

<p class="cpb">IV.</p>

<p>ALMOST any body of water with a depth of a few feet, even an
inland creek, will afford the means to those desirous of taking
such a risk; but an ocean is unquestionably the handiest thing for
the purpose. The North Atlantic, in particular, offers opportunity
during the glassiest calm of a summer day as well as when distorted
by winter tumults; it is necessary only to reduce to the proper
degree the staunchness of the craft in which one goes to sea. Upon
this point there have been arguments; many coastwise seafarers
holding that no canoe whatever is an appropriate vehicle for these
waters; while, on the other hand, there are records of notable
ocean voyages made in canoes. But not in such a canoe, all will
agree, as that selected by young Nelson for his gesture of
indifference to Miss Ambler.</p>

<p>It was a dainty slip of a boat, pretty in pea-green and gold,
fourteen feet long, with green-and-white cushions: it belonged to
the youngest of Nelson's sisters, and she kept it upon an inlet to
be used there as an adjunct to moonlight and a banjo. Upon its
bows, in gold letters, twinkled the unromantic name, Peanut, never
intended for salty incrustations; but salt already dimmed the gold
leaf, that morning, when the Peanut spanked itself through the
harbour mouth and fantastically stood out to sea. The breeze was
from the east, and Nelson knew that Platter Thomas would take the
Caliph&mdash;the Reek and Thomas motorboat&mdash;straight into the
breeze, because thus the consequent splashing would be more
impressive to a passenger. This was the canoeist's unhesitating
cynical conviction, and therefore, desiring to prove to Claire his
utter indifference to herself, he paddled straight into the wind
and was two miles off shore before the Caliph came in sight.</p>

<p>Of course he expected to show her more than his indifference; he
meant her to see a greater man than either of the owners of the
Caliph. And here a little mystery is reached. It is difficult to
understand why he felt that going to sea in a fourteen-foot canoe
proved his indifference to her in particular; though his thought
that the voyage would show her his superiority to Platter and Bill
is more comprehensible. If she admired daring, his position,
compared to that of people in a forty-foot vessel, was admirably
perilous; but to explain his feeling that a special indifference to
her was thus exhibited, it can only be supposed that she was to
understand herself included as a part of his life, and he was
certainly proving his indifference to that.</p>

<p>For the morning sea had become lively. That is, it was
pleasantly choppy for a forty-foot boat, heavy in mahogany and
brass, but rather showily rough for a canoe; and the roughness
increased with the freshening breeze. In fact, long before he heard
the powerful exhaust of the Caliph behind him, Nelson knew he was
committed to the eastward course, which took him always farther off
shore; he was committed to it because he didn't dare to turn round.
He knew that he couldn't trust the Peanut broadside in the trough,
which was growing deeper and deeper, richly green and crested with
sparkling white; and, since he had no choice but to go on, though
the farther he went the more threatening was the sea, his situation
began to present an aspect dishearteningly like the realization of
a nightmare. He had intended his gesture to be magnificent, but not
suicidal; and now, as more and more it bore the latter appearance,
he heard with relief the exhaust of the Caliph growing rapidly
louder. The glittering motorboat overhauled him; then slowed down
and came to its lowest speed, moving alongside the Peanut and not
ten feet away. Platter Thomas and Claire sat side by side in the
control cockpit, and she was laughing merrily.</p>

<p>Nelson, paddling with tired arms, gave them only a cold and
hasty side glance; but there was more than one reason for him to
keep his eyes strictly ahead.</p>

<p>"Nelson!" Claire called. "You haven't any idea how funny you
look! All you need is a pussy cat and plenty of honey wrapped up in
a five-pound note! Where on earth'd you find that ridiculous little
boat? Oh, <i>look</i>!" She grasped her host's arm, and Nelson was
well aware of this impulsive friendliness of hers, even though he
perceived it with the tail of his eye. "Do see its name?" she
cried. "It's called the Peanut." And, thoroughly comprehending that
she was the reason for the Peanut's present voyage, she uttered
peal on peal of girlish laughter.</p>

<p>Platter Thomas was more serious. "Yes," he said. "A peanut's
about all it is too." He addressed Nelson sternly. "Look here; you
ought to know a thing like that hasn't got any business outside the
harbour. You ought to know that much, anyhow."</p>

<p>Nelson did know that much; he knew it poignantly; but when
Claire laughed at him and grasped Platter's arm, his bitterness
became more acute than his anxiety. "Run along!" he said. "That old
gas-tub'll blow up if you ever get a back fire. Run along!"</p>

<p>"Look here!" Platter said. "You go on back where you belong.
That canoe's about a quarter full o' water right now, and if you
stopped heading her up long enough to bail, she'd capsize on you.
Haven't you got any sense?"</p>

<p>"Run along," Nelson said. "Run along and play you're a
sailor!"</p>

<p>Platter was irritated. "Look out or I will!" he retorted; but,
disturbed by his more humane impulses, he made a magnanimous offer.
"Listen! On account of your not having any more sense than to come
out here on that shingle, I'll let you climb into my after cockpit;
and then Claire and I'll take you back inside the harbour, where
you belong. You can stay there and pretend you're out in the real
ocean and have just as good a time as you think you're having now.
Hurry up and climb aboard; I can't fool with you all morning."</p>

<p>"Run along!" Nelson said. "When you want to really learn
something about boats come around and ask me; I'll give you
beginners' lessons free."</p>

<p>His tone, like Platter's, was not one of good-natured badinage,
though it assumed to be that; there was a goading superiority in
it, intended to exasperate. Small boys often take this tone with
one another; and older boys, even of eighteen or twenty, are so
little older that sometimes they use it, too&mdash;most frequently,
no doubt, in the presence of a courted, pretty young creature like
Claire. Nelson and Platter were really insulting each other, though
affecting to engage in casual raillery.</p>

<p>The fact that they did affect at least the air of raillery is an
indication that civilization is progressing: two young sprigs,
rivals for a maiden's favour in the sixteenth-century, would have
made no such pretense; daggers would have been tapped, but in spite
of our increasing civilization, young rivals still sometimes go to
life-and-death lengths; and Nelson deliberately went to that length
now. He profoundly desired the security&mdash;indeed, the
salvation&mdash;of the Caliph's after cockpit; he knew that if he
rejected it and the motorboat departed, his position would be
critical; yet he did reject it. Flopping wildly upon the rushing
seas, into which he kept the Peanut headed by only the most
watchful effort, he nevertheless successfully concealed his real
desperation. "Run along!" he said. "Run along and pretend you're
scarin' the jellyfishes to death!"</p>

<p>Platter, stung, looked down upon him darkly. "All right," he
said. "Don't blame <i>me</i> if you drown!" With that, he slid
forward a strip of brass upon the wheel; the Caliph's exhaust again
began to roar and the boat slapped forward into the chop. A moment
later it was tossing the foam from its risen bows and beginning to
speed; Nelson and the Peanut receded quickly as Claire looked back
at them.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she said, still laughing. "He certainly thought he
was razzing us, didn't he? How funny he does look&mdash;exactly
like a grasshopper on a cucumber rind! Such splashing and lurching!
You'd almost think he was going to upset."</p>

<p>"He will if he isn't careful," Platter said crossly. "Well, it'd
be his own fault. When you offer to help people at sea and they
won't take it, you're supposed to let 'em alone; it's a kind of an
unwritten law or something; but anyhow he's prob'ly all right.
That's his sister's canoe and he ought to know how much it'll
stand. He'll turn around and go back as soon as we're out of sight
and he can't show off any more."</p>

<p>"I guess so," she returned; then she pointed to three small
black triangles lifted at the moment from the surface of the water.
"Aren't those sharks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are."</p>

<p>"They're going the other way, aren't they, Platter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, toward shore."</p>

<p>She laughed delightedly. "How thrilling! If they keep on they'll
pass right by Nelson. You s'pose he'll see them? You s'pose it'll
make him nervous?"</p>

<p>"Do him good if they did," Platter said severely, and then
added, with little hope for his former friend's chances of
improvement: "But they never do hurt anybody and I guess he knows
it."</p>

<p>Here his surmise was correct. To the best of Nelson's
information the sharks in these waters had never attacked a living
person and were not maneaters; nevertheless there is a striking
difference between knowing such a thing on shore, or on a staunch
vessel, and knowing it in a fourteen-foot canoe undecided between
swamping and capsizing. For the three sharks did indeed hold their
course toward the coast; Nelson did indeed see them; and they did
indeed make him nervous, though without doing him the "good" so
securely prophesied for him by young Mr. Thomas.</p>

<p>"You get away from here!" Nelson said angrily to the three
triangles when they were revealed to his view almost directly ahead
of him, and only a few short waves distant.</p>

<p>They continued to approach, placidly sinister.</p>

<p>The Caliph was now so far away that the two figures in the
cockpit were indistinguishable. The boat appeared to be no more
than a small brown arrowhead, flying upon two little white wings of
spume; and Nelson knew that he himself and the Peanut had become
invisible to the Caliph. His human loneliness upon the vast water
all at once seemed a dreadful thing; and the next moment, when he
saw the three dark fins close together and shining wetly in the dip
of the wave just beyond the Peanut's bow, uncontrollable panic
seized upon him suddenly and completely.</p>

<p>"I told you to get <i>away</i> from here!" he shouted
fiercely.</p>

<p>Then, forgetting his urgent need to keep his paddle every
instant to its proper service, he swept it forward through the air
in a gesture threatening the three ominous triangles. The bow of
the Peanut immediately swung round into the trough and the little
boat, caught upon its side, received a cargo of water and half
capsized, half sank. Nelson went down into the cold salt water,
gasping, "Oh, my gosh!"</p>

<p>Mentally, he had an insufferably crowded moment beneath the
surface. He felt excruciating annoyance, hatred, and an anguish of
revulsion. The annoyance was with his own folly, which he had the
pain of realizing fully, under water; the hatred was for Claire;
the revulsion was from his own recent dramatic emotions&mdash;from
all that had led him to offer himself as a drowning breakfast for
three sharks.</p>

<p class="cpb">V.</p>

<p>THEN he got his head out of the splashing water and one hand
upon the side of the canoe, which was not wholly submerged. It gave
him a slight support, enough to sustain him when he paddled with
his other hand. The three triangles were not to be seen; but he had
no need to fear them, nor indeed, to fear anything; for, on such a
day, there are more keen eyes along that coast than landsmen at sea
suspect. The waters there are like the Sahara, where Arabs and
camels appear miraculously from the vacant expanses of sand. Both
sea and sand, where the stranger sees nought else, are incredibly
peopled.</p>

<p>A beating in Nelson's ears grew louder and more definite; it was
the hard voice of a one-cylinder engine in a lobster fisherman's
dory&mdash;a dory of the colour of the sea, a dory much the colour
of its owner. "I see you when you come out the habbuh," he
explained, as he helped Nelson to climb aboard. "'My godfrey
mighty!' I says. 'Them summuh people do lean to fancy ideers about
whut's a good vessel to navigate in.' Had my eye on you and wan't
surprised what happened. Didn't reckanize you, Nelson. I wun't
spread it on you if you tell me why you done it."</p>

<p>"Didn't have any sense," Nelson muttered, so abject was his
mood. "Guess I found out I never did have any."</p>

<p>In this he meant more than the rescuer perceived; he meant that
he had risked his life to impress a worthless girl for whom he now
felt the sharpest distaste, asking of destiny no greater boon than
that he should never see her again. He thought of her with
something like horror; and after they had emptied the Peanut and
taken it in tow, he was glad to leave the scene of his idiocy and
to be heading for the sane and undramatic shore. He wished to be
far from the path of the Caliph on her return to the harbour.</p>

<p>That fast and hardy motorboat, however, speeding back with
almost the accuracy of a bee over her outward course, passed within
fifty yards of the spot now so loathsome to Nelson, and made a
troublous discovery. The dory owner and Nelson had fished two of
the Peanut's cushions out of the water, but could not find the
third, nor the paddle so carelessly misused by Nelson. The Caliph,
higher in the air, and with a greater field of vision, found both.
It was Claire who saw the green-and-white cushion.</p>

<p>"Something ahead to the left," she said. "It's just under water;
but a little of it sticks out. Let's see what it is."</p>

<p>Platter throttled the engine down, then threw out his clutch;
the Caliph lost headway and lay heaving beside the water-logged
green-and-white cushion against which bobbed and snuggled a yellow
paddle. Platter's mouth opened dismally.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" he exclaimed. "Say!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"They're his. They're Nelson's."</p>

<p>"But you don't&mdash;you don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Platter swallowed heavily. "I told him he had no business out
here in that canoe. I told him he didn't. I told him he hadn't any
sense. I told him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Platter! Do you mean he's <i>drowned</i>?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "But&mdash;but&mdash;well, it begins to look kind
of queer."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped. "How awful! How <i>awful</i>!"</p>

<p>"It begins to look pretty queer," Platter repeated. "It certn'ly
does."</p>

<p>They sat staring incredulously over the side of the boat at the
bobbing cushion and paddle; and for a long and disturbing minute
neither of them spoke again. Then she put a trembling hand upon his
arm. "Ought we&mdash;ought we to've made him come with us,
Platter?"</p>

<p>"That's what everybody'll say, I guess," he answered huskily. He
coughed, and his tone became querulous. "You heard me warn him. You
can prove I did. You heard me tell him he had no business to be out
here in that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Platter!" she cried, interrupting him, in sharpest distress.
"You mean you think if anything's happened they'll blame
<i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"I guess they will."</p>

<p>"But why? How could people be so terrible? We didn't have a
thing to do with it&mdash;not a thing! We <i>told</i> him it was
dangerous for him to be out here in that canoe; we <i>begged</i>
him to get in our boat."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know; but they'll say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's just horrible!" she said, and she began to cry. "We tried
to make him come with us, and if something's happened to him it was
absolutely his own fault, and if people&mdash;if they could be so
mean and cruel&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;" Agitation overcame her;
she failed of coherency and could get no further with her
meaning.</p>

<p>"Well," Platter said presently, "we don't know. Somebody
<i>might</i> 'a' picked him up." But he gulped as he said it; and
he added, "Of course it does begin to look kind of queer."</p>

<p>"And they&mdash;they'll blame us?"</p>

<p>For reply, he made an ominous motion with his head, not trusting
his voice; and with that, Claire's weeping became an audible
sobbing. Platter sat silent, still gazing at the cushion and
paddle; but after a time this inaction became intolerable to him.
He took a boat hook from its fastenings; and with a little
difficulty got the paddle and cushion aboard. Then his passenger
asked brokenly, "What you&mdash;what you doing that for?"</p>

<p>"We got to," he answered. "We got to take 'em to&mdash;to his
family."</p>

<p>She protested. "I can't! I just can't! Have we <i>got</i>
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said doggedly. "We got to." He stared with sombre eyes
at the blue coastline; then drawing a long breath, he pushed
forward the clutch lever, and slowly advanced the throttle. The
Caliph moved forward with the running seas. "I guess if it's true
the whole place'll go sour on us," he said. "They'll treat us like
a couple o' murderers all summer." Then he added desperately,
"Well, whatever they do, we got to stand it."</p>

<p>"I can't!" she sobbed. "I can't! I can't!"</p>

<p>But she knew that Platter spoke the truth. What awaited them on
shore must be borne; and in this realization Claire suffered a
sharper pain than any she had yet endured in the whole course of
her life. For, though she did not know it and felt that she had
lived much and at times suffered much, she had never, hitherto,
borne anguish at all. She had endured little achings and some
mortification while her teeth were being straightened; she had been
through difficulties and discouragements at school; she had wept
softly at the funeral of a great-uncle when a quartet sang "Lead,
Kindly Light"; but, until to-day, the worst thing that had ever
happened to her was a light attack of scarlatina. She had
contracted it a week after she "came out," just before the
Christmas holidays, and she had wailed piteously to her mother that
she was "missing everything!" But though she had no suspicion that
her life had been a child's bed of roses, giving her no opportunity
to learn anything worth knowing, she was wholly unprepared to be
blamed for the drowning of a troubled suitor. For she knew well
enough that it was on her account that he had come out into the
open sea in the Peanut.</p>

<p>In justice, it must be said that if Nelson had been less
arrogant when the Caliph offered him help, she might have spared
more thought than she did for the pathos of his struggles in the
water and for the probable grief of his family. But pathos does not
attach itself to the memory of an overbearing person; and so her
shocked imagination was fully occupied with miserable prophetic
pictures of her own shattered summer. The season's career, so
triumphantly begun last night, was already a ruin; she would be
coldly looked upon; she would be pointed out with harsh
disapproval; and, what was sheerly unendurable, for the next week
or two&mdash;her mother's sense of good taste might insist upon
longer&mdash;she could not even go to any of the dances. It was
conceivable that the young people of this new place, at the outset
so cordial, might "drop" her; and, shuddering, she faced a pariah's
tragedy.</p>

<p>"Platter!" she moaned. "I can't go back! Turn the boat around. I
can't go back!"</p>

<p>"Got to," he said. "We got to go through it."</p>

<p>At that, overcome by the thought of the bitter injustice
awaiting her, Claire again sobbed aloud. Platter, occupied with his
own apprehensions of injustice, proved to be unsympathetic.</p>

<p>"Hush up!" he said. "Gosh!"</p>

<p class="cpb">VI.</p>

<p>THE Caliph sped into the harbour entrance and swished through
the still water to the floats before the clubhouse, where two
attendants, dressed like sailors, roped it in its accustomed berth.
Nelson, still thoroughly damp, had just landed from the much slower
dory; and he paused upon the veranda steps looking down icily upon
the arrival of the Caliph. For a moment neither Platter nor Claire
saw him, and as she stepped out upon the float Nelson perceived
that she had been crying. Moreover, in the cockpit there lay his
paddle and the Peanut's cushion, and he understood what must have
been their significance to those who discovered them.</p>

<p>His severity was shaken; he saw that she still wept, and that
her thin young shoulders were hunched and bowed. Grief was there;
was it for him?</p>

<p>Then she saw him, and her startled eyes grew round; a brightness
came upon her face. She rushed to him, running over the swaying
floats as fast as she could. She seized both of his hands and
pressed them to her breast. "<i>Nelson!</i> Oh, thank heaven! Thank
heaven!"</p>

<p>"What for?" he asked gruffly; but he was touched. Nay, he
wavered. Once more they seemed to care for the same things; once
more she seemed adorable.</p>

<p>In her agitation she spoke exactly what she felt and much too
straight from the heart. "What <i>for</i>?" she cried. "Why, we
thought you were drowned and everybody in the whole place would
blame us for it! Everybody'd 'a' said I was to blame; I know they
would!"</p>

<p>The revelation was complete and so was Nelson's disillusionment.
He tried to pull his hands from her; but in the happiness of her
great relief she held them but the tighter, and then, in his
renewed revulsion he forgot to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>"So that's all you were thinking about! It didn't matter a darn
thing about my getting drowned and my father and mother and a few
things like that!" He used a terrible word. His great-grandfather,
under similar circumstances, might have caused a lady to faint by
addressing to her the epithet, "heartless coquette." Nelson's
generation has less care of its English. "Leggo my hands," he said.
"You Prom-Trotter!"</p>

<p>Staggered, she released him; and then slowly, her cheeks burning
and her eyes fiery with the endured insult, she went through the
clubhouse and walked up the dusty hill-road toward her cottage.
"Prom-Trotter!" She had lost him, lost the impetus his competition
would give the others, and that could be borne; but the rage she
felt&mdash;like the anguish that preceded it&mdash;was intolerable.
Anyone passing her would have thought the hill too steep for her,
though she could easily have taken it at a run. She had grown pale,
and her breast heaved with her tumultuous breathing.</p>

<p>"He dared!" she panted. "He <i>dared</i>!"</p>

<p>Again tears were hot upon her eyelids; she clenched her small
hands, and bit her tremulous lower lip to keep it still. Self-pity
and hatred filled her. "I wish he <i>had</i> drowned! I wish those
sharks&mdash;"</p>

<p>In her mind's eye she saw Nelson struggling in the cold salt sea
and the three grim fins approaching hungrily. "Eat him!" she
imagined herself saying. "Eat him!" This time, she willingly
accepted the responsibility; but she got no comfort out of it. She
got no comfort out of anything; she was fiery with anger, yet
helpless in a keen misery.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened to her. As she imagined Nelson in
the water she seemed to see his scornful eyes looking at her with
all the bitterness that was in them just now when he insulted her.
Suddenly, and not knowing how it happened, she realized that Nelson
was a person, a being like herself, full of himself as she was full
of herself. He was not just some impressions made upon her senses,
not just something for her to use; he was as much a person, in
fact, as she was. Moreover, in this revelation she understood that
he had suffered; that she had been nearly the cause of his death;
and that to die meant as much to him as to die would mean to
her.</p>

<p>She stopped short, looking up blankly at the warm noon sky above
the brow of the hill. "Oh, my goodness!" she whispered. "He was
right!"</p>

<p>She was dazed, stricken with her bewilderment and her
unhappiness; what had happened to her appeared to her as nothing
short of tragic. On the contrary, she should have been full of a
new delight; for the thing that had just befallen her on the
hillside was of a prophetic beauty; it was the beginning of her
life as a being independent of her mechanical self. Out of her rage
and pain and the hot pressure of old, old instincts and urges,
intelligence was being born.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, she had just had a thought.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>PART II. RAONARAONA.</h2>

<p class="cpb">VII.</p>

<p>AT RAONA, that ancient Mediterranean town on a cliff ledge
halfway to the sky, there is one of those romantic hotels that once
were monasteries. The pedestrian comes to it by flights of stone
steps leading down from sixteenth-century streets; he enters a
cloister where there are oleander trees and an old
pink-and-white-marble fountain; then he crosses a groined corridor
with a pavement of red tiles worn uneven by centuries of monkish
treading, and walks out into a sunny garden on the top of a
precipice. The garden is murmurous with bees, with the faint
swishing of the slow, turquoise sea a thousand feet below, and
sometimes, perhaps, with a quiet English voice reading the Odyssey
to an invalid drowsing in the tremulous shade of feathered palm
trees. Nothing could be more appropriate than such a reading,
moreover; for the sea, so far below, is the very water traversed by
Odysseus as he sailed nearer to Scylla and Charybdis; and Mr.
Eugene Rennie, an American villa-dweller in Raona, coming into the
garden upon a bright March morning in search of an enfeebled
English friend of his, was pleased to find him thus entertained by
an attendant spinster.</p>

<p>"I mustn't interrupt you, Miss Orbison," the visitor said, as he
seated himself upon a painted iron bench beside them. "Really, this
is just what I persuaded your brother to come here for. It's
gratifying to me to find that on your very first morning you've
discovered the exactly proper thing to do. Won't you go on with the
reading?"</p>

<p>The invalid protested. He was a long, eager-eyed, brown-haired
man whose extreme thinness of body was perceptible even under the
heavy rug that enveloped him to the waist. "No," he said. "My
sister has had enough of reading this morning, and so have I.
Ulysses has been dead a very long time and I have been nearly dead
a longer, I think; I'd like to hear something of people who are
more alive. Last evening after you brought us up from the station
and got us installed in our cells, I contrived to hobble into the
refectory for dinner and so had a view of our fellow guests in this
extraordinary house of entertainment. It seemed to me I never saw a
crew of cosmopolites more provocative to my curiosity. Can they
actually be as interesting as they look, or is it the background?
The fact that we sleep in the cells of dead monks, and have tea in
their abbot's corridor, may lend an exotic tint to people who would
appear commonplace enough elsewhere; but they do seem coloured by
romance here. Who in the world are they all, Eugene?"</p>

<p>"Who are they all?" the American repeated, and shook his head.
"I drop in here for tea sometimes; but I usually don't know many of
the hotel's guests and so I can't tell you definitely much about
them&mdash;which may be the better for you, my friend."</p>

<p>"The better for me?" the Englishman repeated, a little
perplexed. "How 'better'?"</p>

<p>"Because where you have no restraining information you can
indulge your fancy. Yonder, for instance&mdash;that fat,
black-bearded man by the pergola. Why does he wear thick white
gloves in the warm sunshine? Since I can't tell you anything about
him, you are at liberty to imagine any past for him you like.
Obviously, that black-bearded man is a sleeked-up scoundrel who
made himself wickedly rich out of Arab slave raids with Tippoo Tib
thirty years ago, and it is the simplest thing in the world to see
that he keeps his gloves on to conceal a telltale scar."</p>

<p>The invalid laughed. "I should say he wears his white gloves to
show the rest of us how fashionable he is. But how about that sort
of thing?" A movement of his head directed Rennie's attention
toward two dapper young men who had just come into the garden and
stood upon an upper terrace, where they paused to look about them.
"I think I've seen something unpleasantly like those on the
Parisian boulevards at night; and one could imagine a slave-raiding
future as well as past for them."</p>

<p>The slight frown on his forehead was repeated upon the brow of
his American friend. "I'm afraid one could," Rennie said, and his
glance at the two young men showed an increasing disfavour. "That
pair I do happen to know." Then, as if to confirm this information,
the two dapper young men simultaneously caught sight of him, and,
removing their brightly ribboned hats of soft white cloth, saluted
him with a quick yet solemn inclination of the body from the
waist.</p>

<p>They were thin and rather small, of pallidly swarthy complexions
and shining black hair that was like jet shaped into waves. Each
had a long and pointed nose, thin cheeks and noticeably glistening
eyes, to which each had unnecessarily added the glitter of a
monocle upon a black cord. The English invalid, still frowning,
mentioned this adornment. "Monocles! Why in the world do they do
it?"</p>

<p>The American laughed. "That's the fault of you Britishers. You
carried the monocle over the Continent and even to outflung relics
of history like Raona, and the impressionable Latin peoples, at
first petrified by it, afterward perceived its advantages as a
symbol of distinction. Not everyone can wear a ribbon in his
buttonhole; but there are no restrictions upon the single eyeglass.
The two Bastoni brothers yonder took them up last year when they
began to attend the tea dances at the Salone. That's a species of
casino we have here, though we wish we hadn't."</p>

<p>"Is that all they do&mdash;dance at the Salone?"</p>

<p>"Almost," Rennie answered. "They come from Cabrania near here,
and all I've ever heard of their doing, except dancing and mixing
rather nefariously in local politics, is selling their
grandmother's jewellery. Now and then, as a great favour and with
great secrecy, they sell a brooch or a ring&mdash;'family
heirlooms'&mdash;to ladies they've danced with. They buy the
jewellery in Naples, I believe; but they dance exquisitely."</p>

<p>"No doubt," the Englishman said. "They look as though they cut
throats exquisitely too. You speak of them as Latins; but they
appear to me as something rather Saracen."</p>

<p>"Yes, probably," Rennie agreed. "It's a mixed blood hereabouts;
most of the people have a Saracen mingling by inheritance."</p>

<p>"It seems so," the invalid said; and he grunted. "Wolfish look
it gives 'em." He turned his head toward the sea. "I think there
are other people here I'd prefer to meditate upon. There, for
instance."</p>

<p>He nodded toward the railing that enclosed the garden, and
protected absent-minded strollers from walking over the rim of the
precipice. It was a scroll of wrought-iron, black against the
distant hazily twinkling stretches of sea visible from where they
sat; and an American girl, slowly crossing the garden, paused and
put her small gloved hands upon the railing, leaning over it to
look thoughtfully down upon the surf far below her. Standing so,
she was a graceful figure, and the Englishman found her
charming.</p>

<p>"How prettily she's put herself in the precise centre of the
canvas!" he said, for by chance she stood at the end of a short
leafy vista, and was thus, to their view, neatly framed in
shrubberies and a low arch of vines trained overhead. "She's like a
lovely silhouette imagined by the artist in wrought-iron who made
the railing. The scrollwork seems to spring from her, carrying on
her own delicacies of outline; and with that little green knee-long
skirt fluttering against a faded blue sea the colour of a Leonardo
background, she's the most appropriate thing I could imagine for a
Mediterranean garden on a precipice. Yet how completely she's an
American, Eugene! One never mistakes your compatriots for anything
else. She has the American profile that the most charming of your
young ladies all contrive to obtain&mdash;especially the straight
little nose that has the piquant effect of turning upward without
actually doing it. I suppose, alas, she talks through it?"</p>

<p>"My dear Charles Orbison!" Rennie exclaimed. "How careful you
British are never to miss a chance of proving the stubbornness of
your race! Early in the nineteenth century you got the legend
established among you that we're all Yankees and all talk through
our noses; so you'll believe it forever, no matter what your ears
tell you. As a matter of fact, the young lady yonder has studied
music in Paris; she sings really well, and when she talks doesn't
talk through her nose. Neither has she been at the pains to learn
how to chirp like a vociferous little bird in imitation of ladies
in your own island. I'm sure Miss Orbison will forgive me."</p>

<p>"Quite," Miss Orbison returned serenely. "It's the most perfect
description of my own manner of speech. But since you decline to
admit that the pretty young creature yonder talks through her nose,
I think you must have been listening to her."</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. She's a Miss Ambler."</p>

<p>"'Amber' instead of 'Ambler' might have been better," Orbison
said. "To give the colour of the lights in her hair, I mean. I
observe that she's not only an American but an heiress as
well."</p>

<p>Rennie laughed. "Of course all American girls abroad are
heiresses! Why do you think Miss Ambler particularly one?"</p>

<p>"The monocled Saracens," Orbison explained, with a gesture
toward the two Bastoni, who were descending from the upper terrace.
"At sight of her they became instantly a trifle more wolfishly
glittering. They are coming down upon her&mdash;but I must say she
doesn't seem averse."</p>

<p>Miss Ambler, in fact, appeared to be delighted. Turning from the
sea, she waved her hand toward the two young men, smiled with eager
cordiality and called to them some welcoming words in Italian. That
was as far as she got in their own tongue, however; for she fell
back upon French as they came nearer her, and in that and some
fragments of English, the greeting was completed. Each of the
brothers formally kissed the back of her extended hand; then the
little group turned to the railing, and the girl began to chatter
in phrases from the three languages just employed, though the
sound, and not the meaning of what she said, was all that came to
the trio looking on.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you offer a maiden from your own shores a rescue,
Eugene?" the Englishman inquired. "That's too nice a little girl to
be playing Red Riding Hood so gayly."</p>

<p>"She won't be eaten," his friend rejoined. "She's twenty-one,
and as for my offering a rescue, American girls don't encourage
rescues on the part of middle-aged strangers&mdash;though I'm not
wholly a stranger, it's true. Her mother brought letters to me and
they've been to dine with me once or twice since they came to Raona
three weeks ago. Mrs. Ambler is a widow; the daughter yonder is her
only child, and both of them are seeing this part of Europe for the
first time with an eager inexperience I should call quite
perfect."</p>

<p>"That may be," Orbison said. "But surely even the most
inexperienced mother would make some excuse to call her daughter
away from two such young men as that."</p>

<p>"No; she wouldn't," the American returned. "Mrs. Ambler would
never call her daughter away."</p>

<p>"You don't mean the mother might encourage your Saracen
friends?"</p>

<p>"No: but she wouldn't be at all alarmed about them and probably
thinks them 'delightfully foreign.' Besides, she's an American
mother and far too well trained ever to call her daughter
away."</p>

<p>"I dare say," Orbison murmured discontentedly. "But after all, a
girl of twenty-one is still something of a child, and if she has a
mother trained not to interfere&mdash;well, I hope your patriotic
confidence that an American girl is equal to anything may be
warranted, Eugene."</p>

<p>He paused, listening to the cheerful sound of Miss Ambler's
chatter. She was eagerly hurrying forth upon the air an
overcrowding multitude of words, emphasizing most of them, yet
breaking them continually with interjected syllables of laughter,
and accompanying them with an almost uninterrupted pantomime of
gestures. And this voluble pantomime of hers, as the invalid noted,
was not descriptive; her gestures pictured nothing; but were merely
motions expressing liveliness, good will, and the desire to be
entertaining. "Great heaven!" he said with sudden vehemence.
"Wouldn't you give a great deal to know just what's inside that
pretty little head of hers? That child's as animated for those two
sleeked wolves as if they were young Bayard and young Galahad. Why
does she make such a to-do over them? Is it because Americans on
foreign shores are helplessly unable to distrust even sinister
appearing strangers? Or is it&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here he interrupted himself with an exclamation. "Hello! I
think she is to be rescued; but surely the rescuer isn't her
mother. An Italian, isn't she?"</p>

<p>The lady of whom he spoke had just come into the garden from the
hotel, and was descending the steps to the lower terrace, evidently
with the purpose of joining Miss Ambler, upon whom the gaze of her
dark eyes was fixed. She was a pale woman not young: and though she
was dressed all in black, the effect she produced was more graceful
and friendly than sombre. Her gaze was serious, but smilingly so;
and there was even vivacity in the gesture with which she caught
both of Miss Ambler's hands in her own, when she reached her.</p>

<p>The Bastoni brothers seemed to become graver and more
glistening; but the pale lady apparently had no consciousness
whatever of their presence, and, retaining one of Miss Ambler's
hands, she at once moved away with her to another part of the
garden, engaging her in a busy conversation seemingly of cheerful
import. The two Bastoni, thoroughly chilled, stood motionless,
gazing after them; and then, with monocles gleaming icily, they
turned and walked solemnly back into the hotel.</p>

<p>Rennie chuckled. "They've had to give up the hope of eating Red
Riding Hood for this morning, at least."</p>

<p>"Who was that very charming lady, Eugene?" Orbison asked.</p>

<p>"She's called the Princess Liana&mdash;a widow. I'll see that
you meet her immediately, Charles."</p>

<p>But the invalid, who had leaned forward in his long chair, sank
back smiling, and with a gesture of his thin hand, waved away his
friend's badinage. "Too late," he said. "As bad a back as mine
exempts one from all but the impersonal fascinations. Why did she
rush in where a trained American mother wouldn't, Eugene? Has she
an eligible son?"</p>

<p>At that, in appreciation of his friend's perspicacity, Rennie
laughed outright. "She has a son, yes&mdash;a splendid one. You
guessed it like a shot."</p>

<p>"Of course!" Orbison said, and peering through the shrubberies,
he could see the Princess Liana and the girl seated upon an iron
bench at the other end of the garden. "I believe that pretty little
American head is just about the most piquant one I ever saw," he
said. "It's not beautiful, perhaps; but it's as flashingly pretty a
thing as the world can show. And what's inside it? You needn't
laugh at me, you two! What's left for me except to speculate upon
such matters? An invalid's place in the world is a seat in the
stalls to watch the play and try to comprehend the characters of
its people. I have to confess there's one character I see from time
to time that always baffles me&mdash;it's the young American girl
of that kind yonder. To me she's the most mysterious creature the
universe has produced. I have a good enough working-idea of
Kaffirs; of Arabs, Jews, Bengalese, Afghans, Turkish Beys and
Argentine millionaires; I think I know pretty well what goes on in
the mind of a communist girl agitator from Warsaw, or in that of a
cabaret dancer from Budapest; but when I look at these slim and
lively maidens of your tribe, Eugene, it's as though I were
confronting a species from another planet. What does she feel? What
thoughts has she?"</p>

<p>"What does anyone feel? What thoughts of our own do we
understand?" Rennie suggested. "One has to go to Vienna to find out
anything about that; and then what he gets, principally, is an old
definition in new words."</p>

<p>"I don't mean I'd be interested in a psychologist's chart of
her," the Englishman said grumblingly. "But I do wish I knew what
goes on in that young head!"</p>

<p class="cpb">VIII.</p>

<p>THIS Platonic desire of his proved to be not at all an invalid's
mere whim; and, to the pleased amusement of his sister, he omitted
no opportunity to gratify it. In the afternoons, when the tea
tables were set along the walls of the long, dark monkish corridor,
Orbison would come hobbling forth from his cell and direct her to
find places as near Miss Ambler's as possible; he had the maitre
d'hotel change their table in the great refectory to one next to
that of Miss Ambler and her mother; and when he was prevented from
sitting near the Americans for after-dinner coffee, cordials, and
music in the corridor, Miss Orbison accused him of becoming
querulous.</p>

<p>"He swears," she informed Mr. Eugene Rennie one morning in the
garden, a week after his interruption of the reading of the
Odyssey. "Whenever I miss a chance to get him near Miss Ambler he
uses the most fearful language he knows, and he knows a great
deal."</p>

<p>"I don't," Orbison protested, from his long chair. "I may know
it&mdash;I mean, I don't use it."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she cried. "I shouldn't like Mr. Rennie to hear what
you said to me last evening when you thought we weren't going to be
near enough the young lady for you to listen to her chatter during
the after-dinner music. We did finally get near enough, though, Mr.
Rennie; and he was so absorbed in listening to her, he didn't even
apologize to me. I do wonder what Miss Ambler and her mother think
of us, the way we haunt them! Probably they'll expect Charles to
propose, in case you introduce him. I really think you'd better do
that, Mr. Rennie; I'm sure he's pining to meet her."</p>

<p>"I am not," Orbison said brusquely. "I can listen to her and
puzzle about her much better without the pleasure of her
acquaintance. She has a pretty voice; but what she <i>says</i> with
it&mdash;good heavens!"</p>

<p>"You don't find it edifying?" his friend inquired.</p>

<p>"My dear man! I don't find it anything! That's the point&mdash;I
don't find it! I listened to her for an hour last evening and I
give you my word nobody in the world could be astute enough to know
what she was talking about! The great mystery is, what in the name
of a name could she, herself, think she was talking about? It's
impossible; she couldn't tell you, I swear."</p>

<p>"Whom was she talking to?"</p>

<p>"Your two Saracen friends behind their monocles, her mother and
a Japanese gentleman they'd picked up somewhere. Of course the
mother didn't listen; she embroidered and appeared to be able to
detach herself from the daughter's chatter enough to give the music
an absent sort of attention. Miss Ambler began to talk with the
utmost vivacity before they sat down, and she never stopped. I
could only conclude that she was carrying the custom of her own
country into foreign parts. Am I correct? In your great democracy
is it regarded as the duty of a pretty young lady to be incessantly
voluble as the proper entertainment for members of the opposite
sex?"</p>

<p>"To a degree, I believe so," Rennie answered gravely. "You found
not even the germ of an idea in any of her conversation?"</p>

<p>"'Germ?'" the Englishman exclaimed. "It was full of germs! The
trouble seemed to be that all the ideas remained in a germinal
state; though she had the air of possessing the most vigorous
convictions upon them. She asked one of the Bastoni if he'd ever
done any big-game hunting, and without waiting for his answer, said
she had always been 'perfectly wild to see a rhinoceros charge'
because they were such 'thrilling' beasts; but she wouldn't care to
eat one; then she asked the other Bastoni if he believed in
vegetarianism, and told the Japanese gentleman she adored rice, and
asked him if there was a Japanese form of Fascismo and what he
thought of the League of Nations. She didn't give him any chance to
tell her; but said that the League could never deal with the
Soviets and she thought perhaps there was something in the idea
that religion is the opium of the people. She abhorred every form
of 'Victorianism' she said, including Tennyson, and believed that
by the time her own children were grown up, 'birth control' would
be 'regulated by law.' Immediately upon that, she said she was
reading Dante's Inferno 'in the original'; thought its
'medievalism' was 'perfectly rapturous,' and declared her belief
that democracy has proved an utter failure and is producing 'no art
worth the name,' though there probably is 'some advance in
science.' And 'modern interpretive dancing' is an 'advance,' too,
she thought; but the world would be really '<i>so</i> much more
picturesque without steam and electricity!' Altogether, she made me
dizzy. The action of her mind makes me think of a flea upon the
open pages of an encyclopedia."</p>

<p>"You spent the whole evening being dizzied by the flea,
Charles?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't have the chance. Your friend, the Principessa
Liana, came in and carried her away to some kind of party, as I
gathered, at a villa."</p>

<p>"At any rate you've made enough progress toward knowing what's
in the 'pretty young head' to discover that Miss Ambler is like a
flea."</p>

<p>"You call it progress," Orbison exclaimed, "to be made dizzy!
All I've discovered is that listening to an American girl is the
last way in the world to find out what are her constituent parts.
All I get by listening&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his sister interrupted, cautioning him to lower his voice.
Two young people had just come down from the upper terrace and were
walking slowly, in a deep preoccupation with each other, toward one
of the iron benches by the railing. They were Miss Ambler and a
slender, tall, dark boy of a manly and serious, yet gentle,
appearance. That is to say, in the eyes of the two gentlemen, his
seniors, observing him, he seemed to be a boy; but he was
twenty-four, and his good looks were of that keen outline, almost
imperial, still seen at its finest, sometimes, as the ancient
heritage of a son of northern Italy.</p>

<p>Miss Orbison glanced at him appreciatively. "What a
romantic-looking young prince and what pretty looks they're giving
each other!" she whispered. "Surely that's the princess's son you
said was splendid, Mr. Rennie?" Then, upon his nodding, she turned
to Orbison and laughed. "You have before you the very answer to
your puzzle, Charles. Isn't it plain that you're looking at what
would occupy all the space in any young girl's head, even an
American's?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Only the space in her heart." And his tone was
so gloomy that his sister looked amazed.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she murmured. "I thought this was to be a purely
Platonic investigation. American girls as piquant as this one seem
to be high explosives, only to be studied by experienced experts
long accustomed to observing them, like Mr. Rennie. Or perhaps I'm
mistaken, and Mr. Rennie is himself painfully disturbed by this
advent of a Renaissance princeling. Springtime in Raona may be
contagious. Are you as stricken as Charles is, Mr. Rennie?"</p>

<p>She spoke in a lowered voice, almost whispering, for Miss Ambler
and her romantic companion were passing close by, just then; and
Rennie did not hear the question. He, too, had been amazed by the
gloom in the invalid's voice, and sat gazing upon him in delighted
surprise. The American knew that in the reluctant opinion of his
friend's physicians this was the last springtime Orbison would ever
see; but if he could still be depressed by the preoccupation of a
pretty girl's heart, it seemed that at least he was so far
continuing to be most cheeringly alive.</p>

<p class="cpb">IX.</p>

<p>MR. CHARLES ORBISON might well have been asked if a gentleman
wholly mystified by a young lady's mind could be expected to
understand her sentimentally; his impulsive diagnosis of what
filled the heart of Miss Claire Ambler in Raona was mistaken.</p>

<p>As she sat with Arturo Liana upon the green iron bench looking
out upon the classic sea where Greek had fought Greek, and Roman
triremes had met Carthaginian galleys, the girl of twenty-one did
indeed thrill with romance; but not with a romance particularly
concerned with the young gentleman beside her. Neither was the
thrill she felt caused by the tremendous history of the spot where
she sat, though she knew that in their flesh Plato, the Apostle
Paul, Mark Antony, and Cicero had looked upon it; and, in majestic
legend, so had Trojan fugitives. Near at hand, upon her right, the
groves of the Cyclops climbed the buttresses of the snow-mantled
volcano that rose two miles into the air like a god's prodigious
tent pitched at the edge of the sea; and, both left and right, from
this ledge above the precipice, her eye commanded vast sweeps of
surf-edged coast, haunted in every cove and ravine with antique
tragedy. Before her, across the straits that led to Scylla and
Charybdis, there shimmered in the haze of distance, like a mountain
landscape in a dream, the high, blue-cleft shores of old Calabria;
and below her&mdash;far, far below the garden&mdash;the sea was
stained to that brilliancy of turquoise colour Claire found
unbelievable even when she looked at it.</p>

<p>Overhead, behind the monastery and the town of Raona, there were
other incredibilities. Against the sky rose peak and crag and
pinnacle of rock, whereon, "like the lead at the point of a
pencil," she thought, were ancient little walled towns and the
broken towers of stone Saracen and Norman castles. Necromancy must
have got them there, it seemed; for human energy, even in medieval
passions of fear, would have been too feeble&mdash;though, of all
the magic about her, what she thought most necromantic in beauty
was the Greek theatre that crowned the skyward lift at the end of
the long cliff of Raona.</p>

<p>She had been there, the night before, in the moonlight with
Arturo Liana; but the thrill of the romantic she felt then, as now,
was not caused by Arturo, nor was it primarily the work of the epic
beauty surrounding her. Two months earlier, in Rome, she had gone
to the Palatine Hill to write a letter beginning, "Seated upon a
block of marble in the banquet hall of Caesar," and necessarily the
picture suggested to the mind of her correspondent must have had
Claire in the foreground with Caesar somewhat remote. Thus, as she
beheld the august and tragic beauty of Raona, her foremost happy
thought was, "Here, surrounded by marvels, am <i>I!</i>"</p>

<p>What romantically thrilled her, then, was her own presence among
the marvels; a thrill by no means unpardonable and not unknown to
travellers older than Claire; nor need it be held to her discredit
that at times she had the pleasantly tingling impression of herself
that she was the central marvel of all. She always knew when people
were looking at her, although she was pleasantly accustomed to
their doing so. Gentlemen in the Louvre had turned from Velasquez
portraits to look at her; and here in Raona, when she walked
abroad, she was stared at almost violently. When she passed by
them, tourists temporarily forgot this most heroically beautiful of
all earthly landscapes; and when she came into the hotel refectory
for lunch or dinner she well knew that she was politely and
covertly watched to her seat by every eye in the place. Demure,
thoughtful-looking, and apparently unaware, she made no effort to
restrain herself from appearing a little more unconsciously
graceful for her observers' benefit&mdash;it is true that she did a
great many things for her observers' benefit. Indeed, it would not
be straining the point to say that most of what she did in the way
of gesture and look and talk, when observers were present, was for
their benefit. In fact, she sometimes did a little of that for her
own benefit when she was alone.</p>

<p>But in particular she had been steadily aware of the observation
of a gaunt and crippled Englishman; and he would have been
astonished to learn that she had never once failed to know when he
was looking at her or listening to her. Even more he would have
been amazed by the number of things she had done and said because
she knew she had his attention; and probably it would have been the
climax of his surprise to learn that her recent conversation with
the Bastoni and the Japanese gentleman was intended to reveal to
him, in some measure, the variety of the treasures of her mind.</p>

<p>Moreover, as she sat upon the green bench by the garden railing
now, with the romantic-looking young Italian beside her, she was
really giving a little performance, so to speak, for the
Englishman's benefit; though not by the slightest glance in his
direction did she seem to take cognizance of him, and she knew that
from where he sat he could not hear what she said. But she thought
the sound of her voice reached him, and she was careful to keep it
musical, just as she kept her posture and gestures graceful, and
appeared all the while to be deeply absorbed in the young Liana.
Her absorption in him had markedly increased when they came out of
the hotel and into the scope of Orbison's view, for Claire had long
since discovered her absorbed look was the most becoming expression
she knew how to wear.</p>

<p>She wore it now&mdash;for its effect upon both gentlemen, of
course, but more for its effect upon the one at a distance than for
that upon the one at her side; and in this there was an ironical
fatality that haunted her. She could never understand it, and often
gasped in her hopeless puzzlement over it. No matter what the
comparative merits and beauties of any two gentlemen might be, she
was forever doomed, so it seemed, to find herself more interested
in the one at a distance than in the one at her side.</p>

<p>If they exchanged places her interest perversely changed, too,
and her performances helplessly directed themselves at the man who
had moved to a distance; he at once became the more attractive to
her. "Attractive" was her own word, and may be recorded as the most
generously elastic in all her vocabulary; for, although a gentleman
at a little distance was more "attractive" to her than one close at
hand, it might be said that she was indifferent to no man whom she
could possibly contrive to include under that definition. She even
sheltered the Bastoni under it, partly because of their monocles,
it is true; and her treatment of all "attractive" men seemed to
indicate that she felt not only a spontaneous enthusiasm for the
least of them but a duty to all of them&mdash;the duty, apparently,
of offering them a focus for their attention, or, it might be, for
their devotion.</p>

<p>Thus, though Arturo Liana, being at her side, was now in her
eyes principally a picturesque adjunct of the scene she was playing
to the gentleman at a distance, she was far from indifferent to
him. On the contrary, she was not only interested in offering him a
focus for devotion, but she was honestly interested in something
fine and a little mysterious that she perceived in him. "You
<i>are</i> mysterious," she told him, remembering how deeply she
had often pleased young gentlemen at home by such a charge; and she
was laughingly frank enough to mention this now. "I've told boys
that before, just to flatter them; but it's really true about you.
You're mysterious as thunder."</p>

<p>"I am mysterious?" he repeated; and, although when he spoke
English it was usually with an almost undetectable imperfection, he
delighted her by adding, "As sunder? How is sunder mysterious?"</p>

<p>She laughed outright and corrected him. "Thunder, not 'sunder.'
Can't you say 'thunder'?"</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she cried. "Isn't anything I ask you to do
necessary?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I fear it is," he said seriously, almost ruefully.
"Thunder. Is that right? I am as mysterious as sunder&mdash;as
thunder, I wish to say. How?"</p>

<p>At that she seemed to become serious too. "Well, in the first
place you look as if you were keeping some great thought to
yourself."</p>

<p>"Am I so bad? You mean an appearance of egotism?"</p>

<p>"No. Not anything like that. What I mean, it's as if you had a
high ideal you'd never be willing to talk about. I mean you look as
if you were engaged in a great Cause, or something. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Am I?" He smiled, and then replied with a gallantry in which
there was obviously enough genuineness to excuse it: "I am engage'
in sitting on a bench with Miss Claire Ambler. With that privilege,
how could I be engage' in anything else?"</p>

<p>"There you go!" she protested. "Whenever I try to find out what
your mystery is, you say something like that. You always do it,
too, when I mention Baron Bastoni or his brother; but maybe that's
only because you feel a social difference between you and
them."</p>

<p>"Social?" The young man's shoulders, rising slightly, disclaimed
the imputation. "There is an English word, 'snob.' Modern Italy
believes it is bourgeois to be a snob. We will be brother to any
man who is brother to us in what he thinks. I do not care anything
social, one way or the other, about the Bastoni. I am not a
snob."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie told me the other day what you do care about," she
said. "You care about Fascismo."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said gravely. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Is that why you hate the Bastoni? Because they are against it?
The baron told me that almost all the people about here are against
it."</p>

<p>"At least," he said a little sadly, "they are agains' me. I am
not very popular in Raona, Miss Ambler. In the firs' place, I am
<i>forestiere</i>&mdash;from the north&mdash;the people look upon
me as a foreigner as much as they do you; only they would think of
you kindly in that way, and of me unkindly. In the secon' place,
they think I am here to meddle with them; it would not be too much
to say they think I am something quite like an intriguer and a spy.
The Bastoni have been successful to assist that impression."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she asked doubtfully. "They seem so quiet and
nice-mannered I can't imagine it. Why should they do such a
thing?"</p>

<p>"We are upon opposite sides. You see, I am one of the men who
believe Italy is being save' by a leader and his great ideal; and
any of us is ready to make a sacrifice to help bring all the people
to serve the ideal. The people in the country and villages here are
backward and very independent; they don' like it, and the Bastoni
wish to get some power out of that. But probably you can hardly
tell what I am talking about, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can," she said promptly. "You mean the Bastoni are
trying to keep the Fascisti from getting better organized here, and
they think you're doing the organizing; Mr. Rennie told me. But I
don't see why anything like that should make a personal feeling, as
it does seem to do, between you and the baron and his brother. At
home, in America, everybody's either a Republican or a Democrat,
and of course they all vote against each other and call each other
terrible names. But it doesn't really mean anything&mdash;they're
just trying to get the farmers excited and fool the public. But
even the ones that do the most of it against each other know it's
all just a gorgeous bluff and they get together and joke about it.
Why couldn't you do that here? It would be so much more
comfortable; it seems to me you take things too seriously."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we do," he said; and he smiled, not finding any fault
in her complete lack of comprehension. "It would not be easy to
explain to a person from a country where everything is so
comfortable. I am afraid we are worse than serious; for more than
two thousand years we have even been passionate in our politics,
and you see that makes it quite a habit."</p>

<p>"Then it seems to me time you got over it."</p>

<p>The young man was not displeased with her for her flippancy. On
the contrary, he gave her a look of appreciation from his fine dark
eyes and laughed apologetically. "Well, you see, a habit more than
two thousand years old&mdash;it is a little difficult to change!
Would you consent to teach us, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>She instantly returned his glance, and then looked out over the
sea. "You wouldn't pay much attention, I'm afraid," she said, with
just the right proportions of amusement and wistfulness that she
had learned to put into her voice when she wished gentlemen to be
interested in finding out what she felt about them.</p>

<p>"No?" he said; and he responded perfectly to the sentimental
mechanism she had set in motion. "If you will teach I fear I would
pay no attention to anything else."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?" she asked, suddenly grave and sweet.</p>

<p>"Never! I never would!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?" she said again, in a low voice. And with that
she turned her head and gave him a quick, wondering look, a little
startled, that seemed to say, "Will it be you&mdash;some day?"</p>

<p>This bit of performing was by no means all spurious&mdash;it was
a mixture, being partly spontaneous and genuine, in spite of
herself, as it always was when she did it; and yet, of course, it
was essentially a forward movement in her instinctive perpetual
campaign to be a focus. But having made it, she felt that she had
brought matters to a point a little further advanced than was
desirable, at least for the time being; so she rose rather abruptly
from the bench and leaned upon the precipice railing to gaze down
at the sea.</p>

<p>"I think the Blue Grotto they have here is even more wonderful
than the one at Capri," she said briskly. "My mother likes the
Capresi one and we have the most fearful arguments about it." She
turned about, facing him. "Which do you like best, Arturo?"</p>

<p>Arturo's colour had heightened; but now he looked a little
mystified: "You didn't say if you would teach me."</p>

<p>She laughed gayly. "Oh, that! How to make people in this country
understand not to take politics passionately? Well, I have an uncle
at home that tried to be a senator, and he gave a dinner to the man
that beat him&mdash;they said it was the funniest dinner ever
given. Shall I ask Baron Bastoni to give you a dinner, Arturo? Do
let me! We'd get that nice Mr. Rennie to be the toastmaster. He's
so benevolent and witty&mdash;"</p>

<p>She went on chattering while Arturo, who had risen when she did,
stood looking at her helplessly and rather plaintively. Within her,
she was a little derisive of his dejection. "He's really quite
beautiful," she thought; "but he does look almost foolish just
now&mdash;wanting to go on with it and not knowing how to make me!
But that <i>other</i> man&mdash;" As she stood with her back to the
railing, the tail of her eye was taking ardent note of this
magnetic other; and suddenly she decided upon a decisive step
forward with him. Seeming to perceive for the first time the
presence of Mr. Eugene Rennie, she gave him a surprised, sunny
little nod; then let her kindled eyes rest for a slow moment upon
the man in the long chair. She meant to exchange a first direct
look with him&mdash;a look permitting him to guess that she hadn't
minded his changing his table in the refectory&mdash;but Orbison
chose this most special of moments to light a cigarette and he was
entirely preoccupied in that worthless action.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" Claire thought emotionally, "Just how slow are
you intending to be? I'm not going to stay in Raona all my life!
Aren't you ever going to do anything about it?"</p>

<p class="cpb">X.</p>

<p>HER indignation was not lessened as days continued to pass and
Mr. Charles Orbison still did nothing about it. Their first words
and even their first glance remained yet to be exchanged, and under
this strange provocation, Claire's imagination began to be
seriously affected. At night she dreamed of him; by day she found
herself thinking of him almost unremittently; and presently she
realized that she had never before been so continually conscious of
any man. She had fantastic thoughts about him; but she had no fear
that she was fantastic in her conviction that he, on his part, was
still continually observant of her.</p>

<p>Yet this perfectly sound conviction itself increased her
fantasies: "Why don't you let me alone?" she said to him, during
one of the imaginary conversations she frequently had with him. "I
could have a much better time in all this gorgeousness of Raona if
you'd just let me alone. The trouble is I can't quit thinking about
you until you quit thinking about <i>me</i>! Don't you see the
thing is going too far?" And, indeed, by this time, she suspected
that if the Englishman sat upon the bench with her and Arturo Liana
looked on from a distance, she might be, for almost the first time
in her life, more interested in the man at her side.</p>

<p>In her musings upon his unexampled behaviour, she sometimes
murmured her thoughts, or even spoke them aloud; and thus, one
afternoon, as she sat with her mother in the ancient cell that had
been made into a small salon for them, she said dreamily, "Why
doesn't he have Mr. Rennie ask us?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler looked up from her embroidery in surprise. "Why
doesn't who have Mr. Rennie ask us what?"</p>

<p>"That Englishman&mdash;Mr. Orbison. Why doesn't he have Mr.
Rennie ask us to his villa to dine, or for tea, sometime when he's
going there himself. I should think he would, since he's so anxious
to meet us."</p>

<p>"Claire! What gives you the idea the poor man wants to know
us?"</p>

<p>"Poor man?" Claire said sharply. "Why do you call him that?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! He's a hopeless invalid, isn't he? He's the most
tragically shattered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" the daughter cried. "Haven't you any eyes? He's the most
magnificent-looking human creature I've ever seen!"</p>

<p>"What an idea! Why, he's a walking wreck, child&mdash;not that
one doesn't feel awfully sorry for him. He just manages to get
along with two canes, and he's thin as a shadow. Our <i>valet de
chambre</i> says there's something the matter with his spine."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is." The colour had heightened in Claire's cheeks,
and her eyes shone. "Do you know why? That's from a hand grenade in
Flanders. I asked Mr. Rennie and he told me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler nodded sympathetically. "Of course that does help to
make him look magnificent, as you say; especially since anyone can
see he's probably suffered terribly&mdash;and still does, I'm
afraid. Yet he seems very much alive&mdash;that is, his head does.
He has a kind of haggard eagerness very appealing; it's as if he
knew he couldn't get much out of life, but did hope to get that
little. I didn't realize you were interested in him; it's rather
surprising in a girl of your age, especially with such a remarkable
young man as Don Arturo hovering about."</p>

<p>"What's my age got to do with it, Mother? Arturo's wonderful,
but I've seen others like him."</p>

<p>"Where? Indeed you haven't! He's the most charming young man I
ever knew; and I've known more than you have, my dear! Mr. Rennie
says he's the finest young man in Italy. His mother is lovely
too."</p>

<p>"Yes," Claire said thoughtfully. "But I think she manoeuvres a
little."</p>

<p>"To make you like him? Well, that's natural, and a great
compliment to you too. I think she's far from being mercenary; and
her son hasn't a bit of that. No one could look at him for a moment
and believe such a thing."</p>

<p>"No," Claire admitted. "It's true. He isn't that sort in the
least, and I think he's splendid of course. I only meant I've seen
others more like him than I have like Mr. Orbison. I've never seen
anybody at all like Mr. Orbison. He's older, too, and that's rather
fascinating&mdash;particularly when a girl's seen so terribly many
fledglings of about her own age."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler sighed. "Oh, dear! What makes you think the poor man
wants to meet&mdash;us? I haven't seen him show the slightest
symptom."</p>

<p>"He had his table changed to the one next to ours, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"It's nearer the door and he doesn't have to hobble so far with
his two sticks."</p>

<p>"Mother!" Claire exclaimed, and she uttered a sound of pity. "He
doesn't mind! He goes on fairly long walks with that dowdy sister
of his, in spite of his two sticks. I've about made up my mind to
ask Mr. Rennie to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't," her mother interrupted in alarm. "Claire, please!
We don't know Mr. Rennie well enough, and I'm sure he'd understand
what you're up to."</p>

<p>"'Up to'?" the girl repeated, with an almost perfect air of
wondering incredulity. "Mr. Rennie would understand what I'm 'up
to'? What in the world are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Whenever you begin to be hypocritical with me, I know
there's no chance of doing anything with you."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, there is," Claire said surprisingly. "I won't ask Mr.
Rennie; I've just decided not to."</p>

<p>"Then it's because you've decided on something worse. What that
poor man and his sister desire is rest and seclusion, and heaven
knows he needs it! I think you ought to let him alone."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Claire cried, and she laughed a little
excitedly. "What on earth do you think I intend to do, Mother?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler's reply was almost too frank. "I think you've just
decided on a more picturesque way of meeting poor Mr. Orbison than
by asking Mr. Rennie."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" the daughter exclaimed, as she rose from her
chair by a window overlooking the garden. "All I've decided to do
is to go up to the Salone for the afternoon tea dance. Arturo hates
the place and made a fuss about my going there; but it's perfectly
all right. Giuseppe Bastoni will be waiting to take me by the time
I get my hat on; the baron's going to meet us there, and they both
do dance beautifully. Don't worry about my disturbing poor Mr.
Orbison!"</p>

<p>"I might as well not, I suppose," her mother sighed. "Especially
since I know now what you've decided to do at the first
opportunity&mdash;and that you'll probably make the opportunity,
yourself!"</p>

<p>Claire was already in the adjoining room, engaged before a
mirror. "You wicked person!" she called through the open doorway.
"You mean I'll make the opportunity to meet Mr. Orbison in a more
picturesque way, don't you? I should think you'd be afraid to put
such ideas into my head, especially in the most picturesque place
in the world, where one really <i>ought</i> to do picturesque
things! Of course you understand that if I did anything like that
now, after your suggesting it, the whole affair would be absolutely
all your fault." And a few moments later, as her mother remained
persistently silent, Claire added gayly, speaking loudly in order
to be sure that her impudence was understood: "Did you hear what I
said? I said 'the whole affair,' Mother. Once you put such things
into my head, you never can tell where they'll end!"</p>

<p class="cpb">XI.</p>

<p>THE Salone is one thing not beautiful in Raona, though the gay
little modern building is inconspicuous and may be pleasantly
approached through a cypress-bordered garden. What should not be in
Raona is the interior of the Salone; the manufactured throbbings of
a "night club" are misplaced upon the majestic cliff that looked
down upon the passing of Odysseus.</p>

<p>Arturo Liana hated the Salone, yet he was there, this afternoon,
at a table near the door, and alone. At the opposite end of the
room an orchestra of red-coated men produced adroitly suggestive
tango music, to which the silent dancers moved with what seemed to
Arturo a snaky accuracy. Most of the women were pale under heavily
applied artificial complexions that the red lamps failed to make
plausible; the men were pale, too, and there was no merriment in
this sleek dancing, but, on the contrary, a trancelike
gravity&mdash;a gravity as of pallid masks covering intricate and
sly emotions. Slyness seemed the very air of the place; it was the
key of the music; it was in the curiously revealing dresses of some
of the women as well as in their eyes; most of all, Arturo thought,
it was in the eyes of that sly enemy of his, Giuseppe Bastoni, with
whom Claire Ambler was dancing.</p>

<p>Alone, of all the dancers, the young American girl seemed to be
dancing merely to dance and not for the sake of something covert.
She laughed and chattered to her partner; her blue eyes, under her
silver-gray helmet of silk, were bright with pleasure in the
rhythms measured by her feet that moved so lightly in their
twinkling slim black slippers. She was gay as a child is gay; and
in all this vulpine slyness, she was the only frank and natural
young creature. It hurt Arturo to see her there&mdash;as he knew
she knew it did, which made his hurt the keener; and yet he saw
that she could go anywhere and everywhere untouched by what was
about her. It was probably an American quality, he thought; but he
nevertheless wished that she were not so willing to go anywhere and
everywhere, or at least, would be kinder to one adviser in such
matters. She had been a little brusque when he advised her, that
morning, not to go to the Salone.</p>

<p>However, she unexpectedly atoned for her brusqueness now. She
had not seen him when he came in, nor while she danced; but with
the stopping of the music, she and her partner were left just
before Arturo's table. She turned and uttered a little cry of
pleased surprise.</p>

<p>"Arturo! I didn't dream you'd deign to come here after what
you&mdash;How lovely! Wouldn't you like to offer Giuseppe and me
some tea at your table?"</p>

<p>Arturo had risen, and he bowed rather ceremoniously. "I should
be very glad."</p>

<p>Claire sat down at once; but Bastoni, with a bow more
ceremonious than the young Liano's, begged to decline. "I mus'
speak wit' my brozzer," he said; and through his monocle there
flickered at Arturo a cold glance oddly contemplative. For a moment
Claire was puzzled to find herself feeling uncomfortable. There
seemed to be, somewhere about her, a tensity that might have
consequences; but Arturo stood imperturbable, looking straight
before him and not at Bastoni; then he sat down and Bastoni went
quietly away.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he doesn't like it very much," Claire said
thoughtfully. "I told him and the baron I didn't want any tea.
Well, it won't matter; I'll be nice to them later. Why in the world
did you scold me for wanting to come to this interesting place? The
music's really great, and these extraordinary foreign types&mdash;I
wouldn't have missed it for anything! What's the matter with
it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, as you see it. You only see it as interestingly
foreign. There are undercurrents&mdash;undercurrents that I
know."</p>

<p>"Are there?" Claire laughed as she cast a lively glance about
the room. "There's one that I see. Every woman in the place is
covertly looking at you and hoping you'll dance with her. Do you
see that?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "But a few of the men are looking at me by no
means so flatteringly."</p>

<p>"Are they? Arturo, at your age I should think it would be much
more fun to drop politics and just have a great time. You're so
serious!"</p>

<p>"I fear so," he said, and shook his head ruefully. "How can I be
anything but serious when you behave to me in such a manner that
you do?"</p>

<p>"I? Why, I think I'm perfectly heavenly to you!"</p>

<p>"Too much so, indeed! But that is in my own appreciation of you.
I spoke of how you behave toward me. You snub me for my advice and
you come to this absurd and unworthy place with such people as the
Bastoni. Then you immediately drop them when you see me sitting
alone here and unhappy&mdash;and I am glad to say that fellow will
now be twice as much my enemy as before&mdash;and you come to sit
with me. But pretty soon you will go and dance with one of those
fellows again; so it is all too much up and down!"</p>

<p>"Arturo!" she cried; and she added disingenuously: "I haven't an
idea what you're talking about!"</p>

<p>He smiled sadly. "I was so flatter' that you call me
'Arturo'&mdash;until I found you call the Bastoni, also, by their
firs' names."</p>

<p>"But that's nothing! At home we <i>all</i> do that&mdash;with
everybody."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," he said. "That was what remove' my
happiness in it. It was only one of the downs that come between the
ups. You will let me explain what I mean by the ups and downs? I
think you know very well what thoughts I have about you; but I
cannot speak clearly of them to you until you let me see they would
be agreeable to you. Well, you will not let me find that out. One
hour you lif' me up to where I begin to think you will be not
displeased if I speak of what I feel; and the next hour, you send
me down to where I find nothing but a confusion in my mind. You
see, I am a little baffle' and not very happy; it seems to me I
have no advantage over even the Bastoni. So far as I can tell you
have this same treatment for any man whatever."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" Claire exclaimed. "You <i>are</i> a serious
boy! And you must think I'm a very uninventive sort of person, if I
have only the one trick to show all gentlemen! Indeed, I'm
<i>not</i> the same to the Bastoni that I am to you! They're only
fun for me, don't you see? They amuse me because they're so foreign
and different&mdash;I really let 'em hang around partly to listen
to their funny accent. Mother and I scream over them when we're
alone! They haven't had the advantage of a year in London that you
had, Arturo. I don't think they've ever been out of Raona."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said dryly. "They go to Naples sometime'."</p>

<p>"Well, that doesn't help their English accent much!" Claire
laughed. "You don't think I really care anything about them, do
you?"</p>

<p>"You came here with them when I begged you not to do it."</p>

<p>"Just for fun, yes," she said, and then, seeming to become
serious, she leaned toward him across the small table. "You don't
really mind, do you?"</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily. "Will you let me take you back to
your hotel now?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't be that rude to them, I'm afraid," she said, and
then, as he laughed shortly, and with some bitterness, she said
quickly, "Why don't you stay and dance with me too?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "I will not dance here, even with you. Later,
I think I could offer you something better. There is another
orchestra in Raona; it is just of mandolins and violins and
guitars, and I am afraid they play rather sentimental music; but
they know how, and the sentiment is pure. They are giving a
moonlight concert in the Greek theatre to-night. Will you come with
me?"</p>

<p>"It sounds lovely," she said; then she thought that if she went
with him she would not be where Orbison could watch her in the
corridor after dinner. Therefore she began to look conscientious.
"I'm afraid my mother expects me not to go out this evening. I'm
afraid I really ought to spend it with her; but you could dine with
us, couldn't you? Won't you, Arturo? You will, won't you?"</p>

<p>She entreated him in a pretty and coaxing voice; Arturo was
pleased to forget the concert, and accept. "You are very kind," he
said. "I can hope that to-night will be one of the ups; so I will
go now and dream of it. You are about to be ask' to dance
again."</p>

<p>The older Bastoni, in fact, was already bowing before her as
Arturo spoke; and Claire jumped up gayly; but gave her table
companion a soft glance and a little nod, for <i>au revoir</i>,
over the baron's shoulder. Arturo, standing, responded formally,
and summoned a waiter to bring his account.</p>

<p>"Liana not stay long," the baron remarked. "I did not ever see
'im in our Salone before. 'E iss very&mdash;how you say? Severe?
Yes. 'E iss severe young mans."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Claire laughed. "He isn't severe."</p>

<p>"Not?"</p>

<p>"No; he just looked so to-day," she said, and she added
thoughtlessly, "It was only because he didn't want me to come here
and he was a little cross."</p>

<p>"'E advice you not to come?" Bastoni asked in a casual and
commonplace tone. "Wit' my brozzer?"</p>

<p>His voice was so well modulated to the note of a mild and
indifferent inquiry, made merely for the sake of saying something,
that she failed to perceive a particular significance in his
question. Dance music always made her as light-headed as she was
light-footed, her mother sometimes told her with no great
exaggeration. "Arturo says this is a terrible joint," she laughed.
"I think it's huge fun, myself. There aren't any places like this
in Naples, are there?"</p>

<p>"Naple'?" Bastoni said in the same tone of commonplace inquiry.
"Liana tell you I go to Naple'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you?" she asked, a little surprised; and he
misinterpreted the slight widening of her eyes&mdash;it seemed to
him that she was laughing at him secretly. As Eugene Rennie had
told his friend in the hotel garden, the Bastoni sometimes sold a
ring or a brooch or a necklace to the foreign ladies with whom they
danced. The jewel was always represented as an unobtainable
antique, a Bastoni heirloom, and after an adroit temptation, the
sale was made with the air of indulgent protest. Moreover, the two
brothers had hoped to interest Miss Ambler and her mother in the
possession of several such heirlooms, though they had even greater
hopes than this; but the baron knew that the Neapolitan origin of
the jewellery was no longer wholly a secret between him and his
brother&mdash;the Raonese are devoted gossips, and the truth
concerning the Bastoni heirlooms was something of a joke in their
cafs. Familiars in Raona, especially Italians, like Liana, might
easily know all about it; and the baron guessed that Arturo, for
his own purposes, had betrayed him and had warned the American
girl. In the morning, evidently, he had begged her not to go to the
Salone; then he had come there himself and told her that the
brothers dealt in spurious antique jewellery, made in Naples.
Arturo was objectionably dangerous politically; but this personal
interference was too much.</p>

<p>"Nossing to see in Naple'," Bastoni said, placidly gliding in
the tango. "I sink Tunis more interessing. You been Tunis? Not? Zis
fine floor for dance on. You sink so?"</p>

<p>Claire nodded gayly, unaware that she had come in contact with
one of the undercurrents Arturo had mentioned. All the while, this
afternoon, beneath the surface of her thoughts, she was engaged
with an undercurrent of her own; and whatever she said to Arturo or
to the Bastoni was but inconsequent prattle, wholly without any
fruitful significance, she would have sworn. What preoccupied her,
happily, and with the forerunning excitement of the approach to an
adventure, was that idea she had so merrily charged her mother with
putting into her head. In the most picturesque place in the world
an intelligent girl oughtn't to find it difficult to arrange a
picturesque way of meeting a disabled gentleman, she thought.</p>

<p class="cpb">XII.</p>

<p>WITHOUT a definite plan for converting her idea into action
Claire Ambler left everything to the spur of the moment; but she
had determined to spur the moment. She therefore made herself
befittingly picturesque for dinner that evening, in a beaded dress
as shining as pale-blue armour, and almost as heavy in spite of its
scantness; and she added to this the splendid faded gorgeousness of
a fine old Spanish shawl. Thus, when she came into the ancient
refectory with Arturo and her mother, she was at least as vivid as
she could have cared to be. "Like a florist's window," said Eugene
Rennie, who was dining with his English friends. "Flowers, too, can
carry that much colour and only make you glad to look at them."</p>

<p>Then, as she reached her table close by, Claire paused before
she seated herself and, instead of merely nodding, she prettily
made him an odd little curtsy. "Extraordinary child!" he murmured
to his two companions. "I think I join you, Charles, in wondering
what goes on in 'that young head.' Something charming evidently.
Certainly that impulsive little curtsy was charming."</p>

<p>Claire, also, thought it was charming, and with good reason. Not
ten minutes earlier she had made this same impulsive little
curtsy&mdash;the last of a series&mdash;to the mirror in her own
room; but she had not reproduced it for Mr. Eugene Rennie's
benefit. "Well, did you like it?" she was saying mentally to
Orbison, as she began to talk vivaciously to Arturo Liana. "If you
didn't, what's the matter with it! Anyhow, though I don't know just
what it'll be, I'm going to do something you will like, pretty
soon!"</p>

<p>But the opportunity her mother had prophesied she would make was
obviously not to be contrived during the hour she sat at dinner;
picturesque conjunctions are not easily available at such times.
Moreover, when she and Mrs. Ambler and Arturo came out into the
long corridor afterward, for coffee, she was disturbed to see
nothing of the trio who had occupied the next table and preceded
them, by a few minutes, from the refectory. She looked about her
blankly; but a little later, when coffee had been brought and
Arturo was presenting a lighted match to the end of her cigarette,
she caught sight of Orbison at the other end of the corridor. He
was wrapped in a long ulster, with a heavy woollen muffler about
his throat, and with his American friend beside him he was hobbling
toward the passage that led to the cloister and the great outer
gates. This was the first time the invalid had gone forth in the
evening, and Claire jumped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>She stared, neglecting the match, though Arturo held it for her
until it scorched his fingers. "They must be&mdash;they're going up
to the Greek theatre!" she said under her breath.</p>

<p>"Who?" her mother inquired.</p>

<p>"What?" Claire said hazily.</p>

<p>"I understood you to say somebody was going up to the Greek
theatre."</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl returned quickly. "Everybody is. There's a
concert and it's a glorious night&mdash;the most wonderful full
moon&mdash;I saw it from my window even before dinner. Mother, you
wouldn't mind, would you?"</p>

<p>"Mind what?" Mrs. Ambler asked, surprised by the unusual stress
her daughter put upon this petition. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>For a moment Claire looked slightly confused, and she glanced
hastily at Arturo. "Mother, I know I ought to stay here with you;
of course I practically promised to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Mrs. Ambler said. "When did you?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon. I really did mean to spend the evening here
with you; but Arturo asked me, and I know he'd like to go. Would
you mind if we went to that concert at the Greek theatre?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly not," the mystified lady returned. "Why should
I?"</p>

<p>Claire jumped up instantly. "Get your hat and coat," she said to
Arturo. "I won't need more than this shawl. It's the most heavenly
night!"</p>

<p>"Heavenly" was a word she repeated as they walked through the
stone streets of the old town, and she said it again as they began
the ascent of the great ruins of the theatre. "We must go clear up
to the top," she said. "Oh, this heavenly place and this heavenly
night!"</p>

<p>Other figures were climbing with them, shadowy and murmuring, no
one speaking loudly among these gigantic and august relics. "The
people are like ghosts of the ancients," Arturo said in a low
voice. "They climb so quietly and they are all so dim, they might
be the shades of those old, old audiences who came here on such a
night two thousand years ago. How still and mysterious it is! There
could be thousands of people here in these tremendous shadows and
we would not know it."</p>

<p>"It's heavenly!" she sighed again; and at last they came out
upon the stone platform of the huge gallery the Romans had
superimposed upon the Greek structure. Here they were at the top of
the theatre&mdash;upon its crest and upon the crest of precipices,
with an incredible world about them, and the sea, shining and
soundless, far, far below. Claire looked across the classic strait
to the mountains shimmering there in luminous haze, then to left
and right at the unending crescents of coastline based with white,
twinkling surf and crowned with the diamond-point lights of
mountain villages; but, nearer and seeming so close at hand that it
was startling, the vast triangular symmetry of the volcano reposed,
ivory-coloured, in the sky; and when Claire saw above its snows a
faint rosy glow upon the rising masses of smoke, she found her
sighing not eloquent enough. "I must do one of two things," she
said. "I must either sing or I must cry!"</p>

<p>She said it in a whisper, for although vague groupings of
motionless people could be seen here and there among the antique
tiers of seats, and upon the heights of the ruinous gallery
corridor, there was a silence over the place. Deep in the shadow,
far below, upon the ancient stage where the sonorous measures of
Euripides had once been spoken by masked lips, there was a cluster
of tiny golden lights, the lamps of the orchestra; and presently
these native musicians began to play.</p>

<p>As Arturo said, what they played was sentimental; but it was
pure, and they knew how. They were of a race that has music in its
heart and art in its fingers; so now this orchestra of a dozen
violins and mandolins with half as many 'cellos and guitars and a
flute, played old moonlight themes, sonatas, serenades, and gentle
nocturnes, but played them so that a listener who had long since
tired of them might well have thought he had never heard them
played before. The brilliant night was still, save for this music
floating up to the motionless, shadowy groups of people on the
lofty platform of the open gallery; no other sound could they hear
in all the endless space of land and sea revealed to them from that
height; and thus the whole world seemed to have been hushed into a
spellbound listening.</p>

<p>Claire stood leaning upon a massive and rugged cube of fallen
masonry. "I've never known anything like this before&mdash;never!"
she whispered to Arturo. "I never thought there could be a
moonlight night when the moon wasn't the most beautiful thing in
it. To-night it's just a lamp to give illumination. Do you suppose
they'll play the Pastorale? I've learned it, and if they play it
I'm afraid I couldn't help singing it. I honestly believe I
couldn't keep it under!"</p>

<p>She had been in earnest when she said that she must either sing
or weep; a song was in her throat, and like those Raonese musicians
down by the small golden sparks, she "knew how." Somewhere among
the mysterious, still figures of the listeners was the man of whom
she so continually found herself thinking&mdash;because, perhaps,
he thought of her; but just for this while she had forgotten that
she deliberately intended a picturesque meeting with him. An
overpowering sense of beauty was upon her; wings seemed to flutter
ineffably in her breast; and almost unbearably she wanted to sing
with the music that came lifting and lifting to the height where
she stood.</p>

<p>She was trembling.</p>

<p>"It will be beautiful if you sing," Arturo said. "There is no
reason you should not."</p>

<p>Down in the deep semicircular shadow of the amphitheatre they
began to play the Pastorale; and then&mdash;at first almost without
the listeners' being aware of it&mdash;a lovely sound came from no
one could say where; it grew clearer, and was heard over all the
great space of the theatre, yet was never loud. It seemed a natural
part of the beauty of that night&mdash;this voice out of the
silvered heavens overhead, singing the melody of the Pastorale.</p>

<p>No one except Arturo Liana and the singer herself knew who sang;
least of all was she guessed by the man to whom she sang; but she
had in store for her the stirring experience of hearing him
describe what she had done.</p>

<p class="cpb">XIII.</p>

<p>SHE sat by her open window, breakfasting languidly, when she
discovered that he was just below her. His long chair had been
placed in the sunshine of the upper terrace beneath the window,
though she did not know this until she heard his sister giving him
a morning greeting there.</p>

<p>"You don't think you were indiscreet to venture out into the
night air, Charles?" Miss Orbison said; and a scraping upon the
gravel indicated that she dragged one of the iron chairs with her,
and came to sit beside him. "You don't look the worse, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"No. What difference would it make if I did?" he returned, with
a short laugh. "When one's certain to be worse before long in any
event, what difference is it if one's worse a day or two
sooner?"</p>

<p>Miss Orbison protested gently. "Ah, don't say that,
Charles!"</p>

<p>"No. Perhaps it's just as well unsaid. It's better to leave the
most of what we know about some things unsaid, of course; so
forgive me. At any rate, last night made me glad I'd hung on at
least till then. I was no end sorry you hadn't overlooked your cold
and come with us."</p>

<p>"Really! It was quite what Mr. Rennie said it would be,
then?"</p>

<p>"Quite! You could add something to that, if you cared to."</p>

<p>"Really! What was it like, Charles?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't possibly tell you," he said. "It was one of those
things you have to see and hear yourself; you'll get only a feeble
water colour of it from me. I think a chap like Beethoven might
have put it into music; but I doubt if Robert Browning could have
done it in verse."</p>

<p>"Really! It was as impressive as all that?"</p>

<p>"'Impressive,'" he said, and laughed again briefly, in his
discontent with her word. "Would you say that of the volcano
yonder? Last night I thought it was the tent of Zeus and that the
god himself was in bivouac there. We sat where Cicero had sat, I
think; and long before him, Plato. It seemed to me I could see
processions of all the dead Greeks who had sat in that theatre;
they came sweeping up out of the sea and down out of the sky on the
shafts of moonshine. They were shaped of that light, themselves,
and they took their old places in the theatre they must have dearly
loved, since they built it upon the most magnificent site in the
world. You'd have thought then that only a great chant should have
come up to us from the stage; that anything less wouldn't have been
bearable. No, it wasn't so. The music was transfigured, translated
out of itself into something almost intolerably beautiful. And
then, when they played the Pastorale, there came a sweet, carolling
voice from the air&mdash;a woman's voice singing as a nightingale
sings, not singing to be heard, but just out of its own
heart&mdash;and sang the Pastorale with them. You couldn't tell
where she sat or stood, or in what part of the theatre she was; and
you didn't want to know: she was doing simply the loveliest thing a
human being ever did, and you had no wish to see her or even to
learn who she was. What she did, itself, was enough. For
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes? For you, Charles?" his sister asked, as he paused.</p>

<p>"For me," he answered, "it was the final loveliness in the hour
of greatest sheer beauty I've ever known in my life. One doesn't
want to touch such a thing at all."</p>

<p>"No," Miss Orbison said sympathetically. "Of course not,
Charles."</p>

<p>But the girl near the window above them held to a different way
of thinking; she was not of the age when such a thing is to be left
untouched. She sat for a little while, breathing rapidly, her eyes
brilliant and her colour deep, in her delight; then, as the sister
and brother fell silent, devoting their attention to the landscape,
or to reverie, she moved silently out of her chair, and stole to
the mirror across the room. Smiling rapturously upon it she let her
finger tips rest upon their reflected fellows: "You certainly did
something!" she whispered to her counterpart. Then she let her
green Chinese wrapper slide down from her, and began to dress.</p>

<p>Before she had quite finished she heard Miss Orbison speaking
again, but not from beneath the window; evidently she was at a
little distance.</p>

<p>"I'll be back before lunch, Charles," she said. "You can call to
one of the gardeners to fetch Agostino if you need anything. You're
sure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," her brother interrupted a little irritably. "I
sha'n't need you. I'm not flat on my back, yet. Do go along!"</p>

<p>Miss Orbison went, and Claire stepped noiselessly to the window.
Orbison was reclining just below in the warm full sunshine, with
his heavy rug pulled close about him; and no one else was upon the
upper terrace or in the pergola that bordered it. Gardeners were at
work among the flower beds beyond the terrace; and a group of
German travellers stood talking by the railing above the precipice;
but at that distance their voices were not heard more loudly here
than the droning of the bees among the flowering vines that grew
upon the old stone walls of the hotel. Smoke massed itself placidly
upon the shoulders of the volcano; hazy cliffs of lilac rose from a
pale-blue sea, and the air seemed gilded with the southern morning
sunlight. No young heroine of a romantic drama could have wished a
stage better set for her entrance.</p>

<p>Claire selected the prettiest pair of patent-leather slippers
that she owned, and, seated upon a stool before her dressing table,
thoughtfully put them on. "Now where you going to take me?" she
whispered excitedly to her feet, when they were thus becomingly
encased.</p>

<p>But, as she well knew they would, they took her to the pergola
upon the upper terrace. She appeared there a few minutes later,
bright-eyed, high-coloured, altogether charming, with a small red
book in her hand; and, after a musing and impersonal glance about
her, which appeared to reveal nothing to detain her interest, she
seated herself upon a bench beneath the shading vines. She sat in
profile to the Englishman, and only a few paces distant from him;
she had no doubt of his attention, nor that he knew she was
conscious of it. Her lively heart made her aware of its beating;
but she turned over the pages of her book with a steady, graceful
little hand; and then, with her downcast eyes upon the turning
pages, she began to sing the Pastorale in a low, sweet voice, as if
little more than humming the melody to herself. Yet she made it
clear enough, she was sure.</p>

<p>When she had sung it through, her colour was even higher than
before, and she held her book so near to her eyes that she seemed
almost to bury her blushing face in it. This was something she had
not expected&mdash;a moment of fluttering panic&mdash;but she
bravely lowered the book and slowly turned her head to face
him.</p>

<p>Orbison was looking at her intently, with that eagerness in his
haggard eyes her mother had said was "as if he knew he couldn't get
much out of life but did hope to get that little."</p>

<p>For a long moment they looked at each other; then she rose and
went slowly toward him until she stood at his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you liked it, Mr. Orbison," she said. "It was meant
for you."</p>

<p class="cpb">XIV.</p>

<p>HE MADE a movement to rid himself of his rug and rise; but she
stepped forward quickly. "No&mdash;please! May I sit here a little
while?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you may," he said, with his short laugh. "On the
whole, I think you may!" Then he added, as she took the chair his
sister had left beside him, "What were you glad I liked?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"You were humming the Pastorale. Did you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Orbison."</p>

<p>"You were at the Greek theatre last night, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes. I was there."</p>

<p>"How did you know I liked it?"</p>

<p>She made a gesture toward the open window above them. "That's my
room. I heard you telling your sister."</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "But what did you mean by saying the Pastorale
was meant for me? That's what you said, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you meant your humming it just now was meant for
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I meant last night."</p>

<p>"Why, how could that be?" he asked, and he stared at her,
seeming puzzled. "I don't know a dozen people in Raona; and
certainly not anyone who could sing the Pastorale like that. Most
assuredly, I don't know any woman who would be thinking of me when
she did it. What do you mean, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>Claire stared at him incredulously; then she realized that a
free, full voice in the moonlight over a Greek ruin might seem so
much a part of the transfiguring night that it would not be
recognized when it sang just audibly in the daytime and in another
place, even though it sang the same song. The piquant little drama
she had just played for him was a failure.</p>

<p>"You American ladies do like to mystify us slower mortals, I've
observed," Orbison said. "How could that unknown singer have meant
her song for me, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" She hesitated. She had an impulse to burst out at
him: "I was your unknown singer! I guess I ought to know who I sang
for, oughtn't I?" The words were almost upon her lips; but she
withheld them. "All right, then!" she thought. "You wouldn't see it
when I took the trouble to show you, I'm not going to be banal
enough to tell you; so you can just find it out for yourself! It
gives me a secret that I know and you don't; and that's an
advantage over you, anyhow." This was her feeling, and it appeared
to imply that she engaged in some form of contest. All her affairs
with gentlemen, in fact, seemed to involve this sense of contest,
which was so persistent that it could be present even now, when the
gentleman was an invalid.</p>

<p>"You don't answer me," he said.</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely. "Well&mdash;didn't everyone there last night
have the feeling that the song and all the rest of it had a special
meaning for himself alone? I'm sure I did. That's what I tried to
convey by saying it was meant for you. Every one of us could think
so, couldn't we?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he said. "I suppose we could if we had the necessary
amount of egoism. But when that wonderful lady sang last night I
got entirely away from my own egoism for a while. You see it's
rather necessary for me to think of myself as little as possible. I
fix my attention upon other things when I can; and that reminds
me&mdash;I'm in great fear that I owe you an apology."</p>

<p>"Do you? What for?"</p>

<p>"I think you know."</p>

<p>"No; I don't."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I think you do. You see, it happens that I've
become merely some broken machinery about ready to be tossed out on
the junk pile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Orbison!" she cried, protesting; and she leaned toward him,
her eyes shining. "You haven't any right to speak of yourself like
that."</p>

<p>"Haven't I? It's what I am, my dear young lady."</p>

<p>"No! I know how you got your hurt. Heroes aren't broken
machinery, Mr. Orbison!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" he laughed. "You're very old-fashioned. But what
I was trying to say is that even when one can't take part in life
any longer, one can't help watching it. Life for an invalid becomes
a looking on at the lives of others&mdash;at least it does for the
kind of invalid I've found myself to be. Well, I've been looking on
at you, Miss Ambler, and I think I should ask your pardon for
it."</p>

<p>"Do you?" She looked at him gravely. "Why?"</p>

<p>"You're very kind," he said. "Nevertheless, I think I should.
Ever since I first saw you one morning here in the garden, I'm
afraid you've been the central figure in all my looking-on in
Raona. What's more, I've had the feeling that you knew it; that you
were entirely conscious of it; and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's true," she interrupted. "Yes, I knew you were
watching me&mdash;and thinking of me, a little, too, perhaps. Were
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, as a faint colour came into his pale cheeks.
"Not thinking of you a little, though. You see as an
invalid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As an invalid?" she repeated; and she laughed. "If you did it
only as an invalid, perhaps you might owe me an apology, Mr.
Orbison! But anyhow, your watching me&mdash;so much&mdash;and my
knowing it&mdash;so well&mdash;does seem to bring us together as
already comfortably intimate, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so."</p>

<p>"Well, then, when you watched me&mdash;and thought a little
about me&mdash;what did you see and what did you think?"</p>

<p>"You'd really like me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"If you think I can stand it&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" He paused, frowning. "Last night Mr. Rennie and I
talked about you all the way to the Greek theatre&mdash;and you
know I walk slowly! You see, you mystify me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she exclaimed. "Isn't that lovely! Do I? How?"</p>

<p>"In every way; but in particular about a detail of your conduct
that Mr. Rennie and I were discussing, Miss Ambler."</p>

<p>"Indeed? So you weren't just talking of me; you were discussing
me! What was the detail of my conduct you had the debate
about?"</p>

<p>He shook his head dubiously. "I'm afraid you won't like it. Mr.
Rennie had been dining with the Principessa Liana. The apple of her
eye, it appears, is her youngest son, who's spent the last two
winters with her here at their villa. I'm afraid the princess
doesn't think you've been making Don Arturo very happy, Miss
Ambler."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she?" Claire said quickly. "Does she consider that my
special privilege?"</p>

<p>"No more than you consider it a special privilege for me to be
talking to you about it," he returned. "But you remember you asked
me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I invited it. Please go on. What else did Mr. Rennie
say?"</p>

<p>"He said he feared young Liana was taking things rather hard.
He's a serious youngster, and once or twice I've been a little
sorry for him, Miss Ambler."</p>

<p>"You have?" Claire said; and she looked at him darkly. "I
suppose you mean when you've seen him with me?"</p>

<p>"No." Orbison shook his head. "When I've seen him not with you.
When he's with you he looks anxious; but when he's away from you he
looks like Hamlet!"</p>

<p>"Of course you mean you consider me responsible for how he
looks. Is the way Arturo looks the reason I mystify you?"</p>

<p>"It's part of it, yes," the invalid answered. "In the first
place, one can't easily imagine so splendid-looking a young man as
that being allowed to look like Hamlet. One would think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I'd fairly jump at such a chance!" Claire finished for
him, as he hesitated. "I mystify you because I don't jump, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"A little, yes; but there's something more. You meant for me to
speak out, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, one always wonders whether or not American girls are as
democratic at home as they are abroad. It's the most curious
thing&mdash;you seem to think all 'foreigners' equally desirable as
acquaintances and escorts if they're able to make what seems to you
a presentable appearance. What I could never puzzle out&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she interrupted him again, and this time she laughed. "Oh,
now I see what you're talking about and I know what you and Mr.
Rennie were discussing&mdash;and probably what's worrying the
Principessa. You mean the baron and his brother, Giuseppe. You're
talking about my distressing Arturo by playing around with the two
Bastoni, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so; yes."</p>

<p>She nodded, laughed again and went on: "You and the princess and
Mr. Rennie&mdash;and, incidentally, my mother&mdash;can't
understand how I could waste my time going places with the Bastoni
and letting them hang about me here, when there's such a splendid
young man as Arturo available. That's it, isn't it? In the first
place, you wonder why I don't accept him, and in the second, why I
annoy him by seeing something of two men he despises. Well, since
that's my mystery, I'll clear it up for you, Mr. Orbison. You've
been such an attentive audience, I think I owe it to you. I haven't
accepted Don Arturo because he hasn't proposed to me."</p>

<p>"What! But his mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She didn't tell Mr. Rennie her son had proposed to me, Mr.
Orbison."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" she cried, and her laughter sounded gayly
desperate. "I don't deny he wants to. I haven't let him."</p>

<p>"But that's the same thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. If I'd let him go that far it would mean I
intended him to, and I don't. I think that's clear enough on this
point, Mr. Orbison. About the Bastoni, the honest truth is that I
think they're terribly amusing&mdash;I like to dance with 'em and
they speak the funniest English I ever heard. Arturo's nice, but he
isn't funny&mdash;and they are! That's all there is to my mystery,
Mr. Orbison."</p>

<p>He stared at her from under deeply frowning eyebrows; and she
was amazed to see that he was serious; she had thought he would
laugh with her. "You&mdash;" he said. "It's astounding! It's like
a&mdash;" He stopped, frowned even more harshly, and then asked:
"Would you care to hear what you remind me of?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," she replied. "You don't look as if it were
anything very encouraging. But perhaps&mdash;since you've begun
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You remind me of a child I saw in Flanders one day. She was a
little bright-eyed dancing sort of fairy creature and she'd got
hold of some things it amused her to play with. They were new
shells, charged with high explosives, and she was having a
beautiful, light-hearted, good time with 'em."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I don't believe poor Arturo is very likely to
explode, Mr. Orbison."</p>

<p>"No; he's a gentle boy&mdash;patient and self-contained, I
should say, no matter what he suffers. You don't understand my
reference, naturally. There are things beneath the surface in
Raona, Miss Ambler. It isn't as if you were playing around with
American young men&mdash;or British, either. I wonder if you could
attach some seriousness to the princess's anxiety for her son. Mr.
Rennie does. He told me that Don Arturo was in a position here that
possibly involved the element of personal peril and that your
playing around, so to speak, might add to it."</p>

<p>"What!" Claire's eyes opened widely; she was indignant. "I think
I never heard anything much more absurd in my life! Is that his
mother's idea&mdash;and Mr. Rennie's&mdash;and yours? That in my
playing around I play them off against each other?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said hurriedly. "That wasn't implied&mdash;not
exactly."</p>

<p>"'Not exactly'!" she exclaimed, her eyes flashing. "That means
it was!"</p>

<p>"No. I don't imply it was in your intention; but it might result
in the same effect as if it were."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"The Bastoni might interpret themselves as in a manner
competitors with Don Arturo for your favour. They might believe
themselves his rivals."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried. "What utter nonsense!"</p>

<p>"So far as your intention is concerned, it is," Orbison said. "I
don't doubt it. But Mr. Rennie has an idea that the two brothers do
regard themselves somewhat in that light. And since they are young
Liana's bitter enemies politically, and the passions of people here
are very different from the kind you've known elsewhere, Miss
Ambler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she cried. "What on earth have I to do with all
that? Do you think the Bastoni want to marry me? <i>Both</i> of
them? They've been just ordinarily polite, in their way, like
anybody else. I know they're against Don Arturo politically; even
our <i>valet de chambre</i> talks about that, and says they're
determined not to let Arturo organize Fascismo here; but that's
nothing I could have the slightest effect upon, even if I tried. I
don't think the Bastoni have a personal feeling about Arturo,
anyhow. He was hurt with me yesterday because I went to the Salone
with Giuseppe, and then he came there and I soothed him down; but
he looked so disapproving that the baron noticed it and spoke of it
to me. I told him what was the matter and the baron didn't think
anything of it; he began to talk of other things right away. If he
felt anything personal he'd have shown it then, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," Orbison interrupted. "You say you 'told him what
was the matter.' Do you mean you told him that young Liana had
asked you not to go there with them?"</p>

<p>"The baron asked me if Arturo had advised me not to go to the
Salone with his brother. Well, Arturo didn't want me to go there
with anybody; he hates the place."</p>

<p>"But what did you tell the baron when he asked you that about
his brother?"</p>

<p>"Why!&mdash;I said 'Yes,' of course."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"But good gracious!" Claire cried. "Why shouldn't I? I've just
told you it didn't make the slightest difference. We were dancing,
and I doubt if he even noticed what I said. As a matter of fact,
I'm positive he didn't. I'm not wholly an idiot, Mr. Orbison!" She
spoke with agitation and there was a smarting threat of tears in
her eyes, in spite of her. This was not at all the conversation she
had expected to hold with the invalid gentleman when she had
bravely left the pergola to speak to him; and she was bewildered,
even chagrined. "I really am not an idiot," she said. "I'm
not&mdash;even though I see you think I am!"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do!" she said huskily, her emotion increasing. "Of course
you do! You think I've done harm."</p>

<p>He lifted a thin hand in protest. "No, no! I hope you
haven't."</p>

<p>"Ah! That means you do think so! That's what your watching me
and thinking about me, ever since you came here, amounts to! I
asked you to tell me what you thought of me, and I get what I
deserve for being a bold enough idiot to ask you such a question!
You've looked me well over and you've decided I'm a fool!"</p>

<p>Distressed, for she spoke passionately, he gently touched her
forearm. "My dear Miss Ambler!" he said. "Don't you remember we
began our talk with an apology from me for being so intrusive as to
think of you at all?"</p>

<p>She looked at the emaciated fingers placatively just touching
her arm; and suddenly the tears that had threatened filled her
eyes; but she smiled upon him through them. "You didn't owe me an
apology for that," she said. "I've been doing as much thinking
about you as you have about me."</p>

<p>He looked startled. "What? No&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him a little. "I'm not the kind of fool you
think I am," she said. "But there are some things nobody can
help!"</p>

<p>Then, not permitting a second anti-climax to mar the conclusion
of this interview that had begun with one, she jumped up and walked
quickly back into the hotel. Emotions varied and conflicting wrung
her, yet at the same time thrilled her. They were altogether
genuine and far from shallow; but what actually controlled her, in
spite of them, was her sense of dramatic effect. Claire's exits
were always excellent.</p>

<p class="cpb">XV.</p>

<p>SHE knew that her exits were excellent, even though, unlike her
entrances, they had to be made on the spur of the moment. An
entrance could always be planned, as she had planned hers this
morning. She might have written it for herself: "Enter heroine with
red book of poems in her hand, and sings aria, Rupert
listening."</p>

<p>In her room, still blushing and with eyes still wet, she sat
down to wonder breathlessly how much Orbison would think she had
implied by her final words to him; but even in this she was
nevertheless conscious of her duality as both an emotional person
and a stage director. It was a consciousness that annoyed her; and
sometimes, when it became acute, as it did this morning, it almost
dismayed her. All her life&mdash;even when she was a
child&mdash;she had seemed to be not one person but two. One was an
honest person and the other appeared to be an artist. The honest
person did the feeling and most of the thinking; but the artist
directed her behaviour and cared about nothing except picturesque
effects. When Claire was nineteen and her father died, she had been
truly grief-stricken; but the artist was present at his funeral;
and she sometimes remembered with amazement that it was the artist
who made her bow her head at the cemetery. This was a recollection
she always hurried out of her thoughts, lest the amazement become
shame.</p>

<p>"Heaven, please tell me," she said now, in her cell bedroom in
Raona. "What's the matter with me? What am I? Can't I ever in my
whole life do anything natural?"</p>

<p>For it seemed to her that she was in love with the broken
Englishman. "Something about him," as she thought, had roused a
depth of feeling she had not known before; his worn, fine face,
retaining the haggard outlines of what had been a conspicuous manly
beauty, was always before her, whether her actual eyes beheld it or
not; the thought of him haunted her with pain and a strange joy;
and she wanted him to know it. There had been days when Orbison,
lying pallid in his chair in the garden, seemed almost to be dying;
and she had wished to go to his side and kneel and say, "Let me die
with you, dear." But even that was the picturesque impulse; she
knew she would have knelt gracefully, and that even with the man
she loved she could not evade her damnable artist's stage
directions.</p>

<p>"I'm terrible!" she moaned to herself; and looked in the mirror.
"But maybe it's because of that."</p>

<p>She meant her extraordinary prettiness. Perhaps her duality was
caused by her comeliness&mdash;girls born to be pretty might be
doomed for that very reason, to behave picturesquely. "Ah! If he
knew me as I really am," she thought, "he wouldn't care for me;
he'd be horrified instead." Then she had a brightening idea.
"Probably every other good-looking girl in the world has these same
two natures." And now she smiled to the glass. "Except the stupid
ones!"</p>

<p>She was not really despondent; she was excited, and happily so.
Moreover, in her thought, "If he knew me as I really am he wouldn't
care for me," there was a significant assumption, although she did
not pause to make it more definite. Nevertheless, it was therein
contained: "Not knowing me, he does care for me!"</p>

<p>Yet she had said to him: "You've looked me well over and you've
decided I'm a fool!" She had wept when he touched her with his
hand, so pitiably thin; but the tears that filled her eyes then
were already in them, because he had insisted upon talking
reproachfully to her about Arturo Liana and those foolish Bastoni.
That did not distress her now; she had let the Bastoni play around
because they were funny and danced well, as she explained; and she
was sorry if that had distressed Arturo, but there was no harm in
it, she was sure; and since Orbison seemed to wish it, she would
snub the Bastoni and be so nice to Arturo that he'd forget. She did
not really believe the Englishman thought her a fool because he
compared her to a fairy child playing with explosives; and her
strong impression was that a girl's picturesqueness suffers no
damage by a gentleman's persuading himself that other gentlemen are
becoming explosive on her account.</p>

<p>Her eyes, still upon the mirror, grew large and bright with a
stirred appreciation: the image before her was of a personage, that
wonderful lady who had given him, he said, the final loveliness of
the hour of greatest beauty he had known in all his life. Claire
had resolved never to tell him that she was the lady, and she was
determined to maintain her resolution. Her only problem, therefore,
was to think of the best way of letting him find it out for
himself.</p>

<p>She had not thought of any way at all when she and her mother
went into the refectory for lunch; but she had the pleasure of
seeing that his colour heightened&mdash;as she was aware her own
did&mdash;when she nodded to him. Miss Orbison joined him in
returning her salutation; Claire murmured her mother's name to
them; and, when the meal was finished, the four people walked
together out into the garden and together drank their coffee at a
table placed beside Orbison's long chair. Mrs. Ambler noticed that
it was a relief to him to get back to this chair.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd have luncheon brought to you here
outdoors," she said. "The chairs in the refectory are so
uncomfortably stiff."</p>

<p>He shook his head and smiled. "No. One clings to ordinary
habits, doing what other people do as long as one can. Besides,
this really isn't a proper place to eat&mdash;not from a porcelain
plate, at least; I'm afraid they'd not understand if I asked for
vine leaves. Do you know the whole story of Raona, Miss Ambler? Do
you know the beginning of it?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking at him with a full straight gaze, not
lacking in a mysterious gravity. "I don't even know the end of it,
Mr. Orbison."</p>

<p>At that, his glance swept away from her quickly, and he pointed
down the coast to their left. "The first Greeks landed just there,"
he said; and he told her of the storm that had driven the mariners
back down the strait and forced this landing. She hung upon his
story, never looking away from him, while Mrs. Ambler and Miss
Orbison produced embroideries and plied their needles, listening,
too, in the dreamy manner of sewing ladies. He talked of antique
peoples as if they were human and comprehensible, not dried data of
a dried historian; and, having one so intently gazing a listener as
never before inspired him, he told her of the Greek fighting down
the coast, of the coming of the war fleets of Alcibiades, sweeping
the sea before them, of the perishing of that navy and of the
strange death of Archimedes, and of Plato's sailing back to Athens
after his wicked last repartee to the tyrant Dionysius.</p>

<p>"How lovely!" Claire cried at this, and she clasped her hands
together, delighted with the ancient witticism. "I always thought
Plato must be about the same as the square of the hypotenuse, or
metempsychosis&mdash;until this afternoon. I'd never have believed
there was anybody in the world who could make me wish I'd known
him, Mr. Orbison!"</p>

<p>Miss Orbison looked at her watch. "Dear me! It's almost tea-time
already. Charles, you do have a silver tongue!"</p>

<p>"I think you mean it's metal because it can be used so long
without wearing out," he said; and glancing over his shoulder, he
shook his head. "There's a gentleman I fear thinks it must be of
iron; I hadn't noticed him. He has the air of a long-suffering
poet, waiting a chance to speak to Miss Ambler."</p>

<p>The gentleman was Arturo Liana. He stood by the precipice
railing, fiddling pensively with his straw hat and a walking stick,
too patiently courteous to interrupt by a closer approach. Claire
was not pleased to remember that she had determined to be nice to
him; for now, at last, the man at her side had become infinitely
more to her than the man at a distance. She gave the invalid a
softly reproachful glance eloquent of her meaning: "All right," she
said to him, entirely in this ocular demonstration. "I'll obey you
and be an angel to him; but it's foolish and drags me miserably
away from you."</p>

<p>What she said with her voice was less pathetic, though she
sighed as she rose. "I suppose so. Probably wants me to take a
walk. Oh, very well!"</p>

<p>She gave the man in the chair another look, one that meant,
"You're doing this!" Then she turned away, and, rearranging her
expression to a more welcoming aspect, walked briskly toward
Arturo. She did not reach him, however, without being
intercepted.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Bastoni rose from the bench where he had been sitting
beyond a clustering shrubbery, and stepped forth to stand bowing
before her.</p>

<p>"Miss Ambler&mdash;you please?"</p>

<p>She stopped. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"I please like to invite you. You will come to dance? Music at
Salone nice good zis assternoon. You please enjoy to come?"</p>

<p>"No," she said; and she intended the coldness with which she
spoke and looked at him to be observed by the person whose
suggestion she thought she was obeying. "No, I believe not."</p>

<p>Giuseppe stared through his monocle. "No? You don't like?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day."</p>

<p>"No? You don't like to come because we go to Naple' sometime, my
brozzer an' me?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any idea what you mean," she said. "I must go on; I'm
keeping Mr. Liana waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Meester Liana!" Giuseppe stood aside, and bowed
deeply. "You don' like keep Meester Liana to wait. Oh, no!
Excuse!"</p>

<p>He turned at once and strode out of the garden, while Claire,
continuing upon her way to Arturo, glanced brightly back over her
shoulder at the man in the long chair.</p>

<p>"You see?" she seemed to ask. "Are you satisfied with me?"</p>

<p>But he did not appear to be satisfied; and she was puzzled.
"Good gracious!" she thought. "Isn't there any pleasing you at
all?"</p>

<p>Apparently there wasn't, for he frowned heavily; and the
unfortunate Arturo paid for it. She was anything but angelic to him
during their walk.</p>

<p class="cpb">XVI.</p>

<p>ARTURO complained of this gently as they stood in the cloister
for a few moments at parting, upon their return. Twilight had
fallen, the air was still; the only sound they heard, except a
gurgle of water in the pink marble fountain, was a lonely melody
played upon a reed pipe far away and high above them, on a
cliffside rising behind the narrow town. It was the Pastorale; and
Arturo's sigh was as wistful as the tune.</p>

<p>"You were so kind last night," he said. "It was heaven for me,
even before you sang. To-day you drop me over the precipice again.
I never can know what I do to displease you."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, Arturo."</p>

<p>"Then why do you treat me so?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she exclaimed. "It seems to me I treat you
pretty well. You saw how I snubbed that poor little Giuseppe
Bastoni, merely because you were waiting to speak to me. I thought
he made it pretty plain that he was offended, and of course that's
the end of me for both him and his brother. Well, I did that for
you, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"But if you did, you seem to resent that you did it," Arturo
said. "You have found some fault with everything I have said. If I
say, 'It is fine weather,' you say, 'It is bad weather'! When I ask
why you believe so, you begin to whistle and you whistle for half
an hour!"</p>

<p>"Then don't ask me why I believe it's bad weather. That's
simple, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "The sun could be so bright if you would let it!
Why can't I please you a little?"</p>

<p>Claire looked at him seriously. "You do."</p>

<p>"I can't think so to-day. Yesterday I could. It is an eternal
up-and-down!"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I like you as well to-day as I did yesterday.
I'm always pleased with you, Arturo."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he asked. "Just 'pleased'? Just you 'like'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said, and she shook her head despairingly.
"There it is! Whenever I give you the chance, you say things like
that! Don't you see that I spend half my time with you trying to
keep you from asking such questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he answered. "I am afraid it is what you have
wish'."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>Arturo looked at her steadily, with dark, sad eyes. "Yes, I
think it is true. You have wish' that I should want to ask such
questions but that I should not ask them. I think you like men to
be in love with you but not to trouble you by telling you. Isn't it
true?"</p>

<p>"What!" she cried; but even in her own ears the indignation she
put into her voice had a sound somewhat enfeebled. Confronted with
so simple yet exact a statement of fact, she was at a loss; and,
indeed, she felt both helpless and foolish. She could find nothing
better to do than to employ a stencil that she herself knew was too
worn with coquettes' usage to be an adequate defence. "I never
heard anything so unjust in all my life!"</p>

<p>"Then you do wish me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"To tell me what?" she said impatiently; but in the same instant
she understood her mistake and that he would reply, "I love you!"
She stepped back from him quickly, her hands fluttering in hasty
gestures of negation. "No! I don't mean that; I don't mean to ask
you such a question. Arturo, please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what I said of you is true."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" And with that, she uttered some little incoherent
sounds of petulant distress; then fell back upon another and even
more useless stencil: "Arturo, don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," he said quietly; but there was something in
his voice that made her catch her breath. "You needn't be
disturbed. I will not say what you fear I would say. I will never
say it."</p>

<p>"Arturo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all," he said.</p>

<p>Then they stood facing each other, not speaking. Her stencils
had not aided her; she knew herself accused but defenseless before
the accusation; and helplessly, in her confusion, she found nothing
at all to say. She had a sensation as of becoming smaller; and
Arturo as he stood before her, slender but vague in the twilight,
with tragedy in his dark and gentle eyes, was like a tall judge of
her.</p>

<p>The white columns of the cloister and the outlines of the marble
fountain, in the wan light, were to remain in her memory as a
background like the architectural shapings of a shadowy judgment
seat where she had been unable to clear herself of a true charge.
But Arturo was an unreproachful judge. Orbison had spoken of him as
Hamlet; and just such a sorrowful dignity invested the young
Italian in this parting with the American girl; for a parting it
was&mdash;a final one. Foreseeing Providence has been kind in not
making us, also, foreseeing; and so we do not know what is to
remain most keenly in our memories. Claire's thoughts were more
annoying than acutely painful and were principally occupied with
herself; she no more knew that for years afterward she was
unavailingly to remember Arturo Liana as he stood looking at her
now in the gray cloister than she knew that this was the last time
she would ever see him.</p>

<p>He bowed to her gravely, and left her. "Oh, well&mdash;" she
murmured; and she sighed a deep sigh, in which naturally a little
anger mingled with other emotions; for she could not be put at a
disadvantage and remain wholly unresentful. "Well, it's what I
get!" she thought, meaning that she had been punished for obeying a
too virtuous gentleman's suggestions. Then, going into the long
corridor in the interior of the hotel, she discovered this
gentleman seated alone at a small tea table where he was lingering
with some cold cups and saucers and the end of a cigarette.</p>

<p>She immediately placed herself in a chair opposite him at the
table. "Well, what was the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"When, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>"When I did what you'd told me I ought to do."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady!" he objected. "I have too many
culpabilities of my own; I don't tell people what they ought to
do."</p>

<p>"You told me," she said sharply. "Certainly you did. And I do
wish you wouldn't call me a 'dear young lady,' Mr. Orbison. You're
not my uncle; you're not old enough."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am," he said, smiling. "At least I'm afraid I feel
so."</p>

<p>"No, you don't," she returned quickly. "You haven't been
watching me like an uncle&mdash;not a bit&mdash;and I haven't been
like a niece being watched!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said with some awkwardness, and returned
to her opening question. "What was the matter when?"</p>

<p>"I think you're evading. You know perfectly you did tell me what
you thought I ought to do&mdash;what you and Mr. Rennie and Arturo
Liana's mother thought I ought to do. You told me this morning and
infuriated me. You said that if I had any decency I'd be nice to
Arturo and drop the baron and Giuseppe."</p>

<p>"No, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, absolutely. So I've done it. You saw me freeze
Giuseppe Bastoni when I left you this afternoon to join Arturo. You
were looking&mdash;I saw you were; and I snubbed Giuseppe the worst
I know how. He knew I meant it, and he and his brother will
understand perfectly that it's permanent. I think he was in a cold
rage when I went by him. Then I looked back to see if I had done
what I meant to, which was just to please you, and I saw I hadn't.
You looked like the <i>siroc</i>! Does it make you bitter to have a
girl try to please you?"</p>

<p>He did not reply at once; and she took a cigarette from a silver
case lying open before him on the table, and lighted it herself, as
he seemed unaware. "Well, does it? What was wrong with what I
did?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," he said thoughtfully. "I didn't propose a line
of conduct for you this morning. You said I'd been watching you and
asked me what I saw. Among other things, I said I hadn't been able
to understand how any girl could give such fellows as the Bastoni
any ground for conceiving, however mistakenly, that they were
perhaps rivals with so splendid a young man as Arturo Liana. But
whatever harm there was in it had been done; I didn't suggest an
attempt to undo it by making those two wolfish creatures more
poisonously young Liana's enemies than ever."</p>

<p>"What?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said calmly. "That was what you must have
accomplished. Don't you see it?"</p>

<p>She looked at him almost fiercely. "I did exactly what you as
much as told me to. You've just admitted you reproached me with
giving the Bastoni a chance to think they were Arturo's rivals.
Well, I snubbed Giuseppe, practically in Arturo's presence. Now you
attack me for making him his enemy instead of his rival. No, I
don't see it!"</p>

<p>"I'll try to make it clearer, Miss Ambler. The truth is, the
Bastoni have the reputation of being pretty bad hats. You naturally
wouldn't have known that; but there's no doubt of it; and there are
quite a number of other bad hats in the place they come from and
the villages between Raona and there. You know most of the
landowners don't go to their own estates unless they're heavily
armed and guarded by the <i>carabinieri</i>; it isn't altogether a
safe neighbourhood except for foreigners like us&mdash;they let us
alone because we increase the revenue. Well, the Bastoni know what
their own reputation is; and that they're fairly notorious among
the Italians for selling spurious antique jewellery to foreigners
and as associates of the other bad hats&mdash;and young Liana is an
Italian. Don't you see what conclusion this Giuseppe would come to
in his mind? You'd formerly been most gracious to him and his
brother. Then abruptly, with Liana present, you snub him and go to
Liana. Of course he'd think Liana had been saying things about him
to you and ruined him with you. That's why I seemed disturbed when
you looked back at me. Don't you understand, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>Claire's head drooped and so did her eyelids; she slowly crushed
her cigarette down into an ash tray upon the table. "You do think
I'm a fool," she said in a low voice. "It seems a little unjust
when I did only what I thought you wanted me to do. <i>I</i> didn't
want to do it. Do you think I wanted to go away from you and walk
with Arturo? I suppose you'll tell me now that you didn't suggest
my being nice to him, either!"</p>

<p>"No," Orbison said. "I didn't."</p>

<p>She looked up slowly. "No?"</p>

<p>"I didn't suggest your doing anything at all," he insisted.
"Certainly not that you be 'nice' to a young man obviously
suffering on your account&mdash;not unless you meant to accept him.
Naturally, if you didn't mean to do that, your being 'nice' to him
would only increase his torture."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, smiling suddenly. "I've pleased you
about that, at least. I was the very devil to him! When we got back
from our walk just now we had rather a scene; he virtually
denounced me as a trifler. Then he stalked off, and I don't know
when he'll be back. That is to say, my being 'nice' to him because
you suggested it merely made us both wretched and on that account
I'm sure you're pleased with me at last, Mr. Orbison!"</p>

<p>"Pleased with you at last!" he repeated in a tone ironically
rueful; and he laughed. "Much you bother yourself whether I'm
pleased with you or not!"</p>

<p>"No," she returned. "That won't do." She put her forearms on the
table and leaned toward him, keeping her gaze gravely and
unwaveringly upon his. "I'm serious; it won't do. You know how much
I care to please you and I know you know it."</p>

<p>"I don't," he protested; and as his pallid cheeks once more
showed colour in response to words of hers, pain came into his
eyes, and he had the look of a man who struggles, but struggles
feebly, through lack of strength. "I don't know anything of the
kind. It's nonsense, and you mustn't&mdash;" He contrived to utter
another laugh. "You are an astonishing young woman, I must say! Is
your conception of ethics based solely upon the pleasing of the
nearest available man?"</p>

<p>"Go on," she said, not moving, nor letting her eyes fall from
his. "'The nearest available man,' you say. Very well&mdash;insult
me all you please! We both know that pleasing you is all I care
about; but something you don't know is that I've already pleased
you more than anyone else ever did. <i>I</i> know it, though; and
do you think that while I have that in my mind I'll ever give up
going on trying to please you? Do you?"</p>

<p>He seemed to struggle with an increasing pain. "Upon my word, I
don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do," she said, and her eyes grew brighter; her voice
was tremulous but happy. "We both know."</p>

<p>"Indeed I&mdash;I&mdash;" Stammering, he made an effort to rise
from his chair; but he had no strength, and, in difficulties with
the table, could not at once get upon his feet. His sister, coming
into the corridor at that moment, ran to help him.</p>

<p>"Charles!" she cried. "You might have fallen! Why didn't you ask
Miss Ambler to help you?"</p>

<p>Claire answered her, but kept her eyes upon the flushed and
panting invalid. "He knew I wouldn't," she said. "Not to help him
get away!" And at that the stout and hearty Miss Orbison, after a
sharper glance at both of them, looked seriously disturbed.</p>

<p class="cpb">XVII.</p>

<p>CLAIRE was to see this troubled look upon the ruddy face of the
English spinster repeated frequently. "What's the matter with that
woman?" the girl asked her mother one day in their small salon.
"She looked so reliable and solid when they first came
here&mdash;not that she looked happy, of course, if you caught her
off her guard when her brother wasn't looking&mdash;but anyhow she
hadn't that fretting expression you see about her eyes and mouth so
much lately. It can't be because Mr. Orbison's health is worse,
because it isn't; he's just the same."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler sighed. "I shouldn't think one would need to seek
far for the reason a sister would look troubled with a brother in
that shattered condition&mdash;especially when the brother's as
lovely a man as hers is. I've discovered that since we've begun to
see so much of them. He is lovely."</p>

<p>"Yes," Claire said absently. "But I meant something
different&mdash;that expression she's got just lately."</p>

<p>"I haven't noticed it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she only has it when she looks at me. Mother, you don't
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think what?"</p>

<p>Claire had paused, gazing out of the window dreamily; and her
mother repeated the question.</p>

<p>"What is it I don't think?"</p>

<p>"You don't think that sometimes&mdash;they avoid us?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" Mrs. Ambler exclaimed, highly amused. "They
don't get much chance! You've taken pretty good care of that, I
must say! We go to the refectory when they do; we come out to the
corridor when they do; we go out to the garden with them; we're
everywhere that they are, at the same hour and in the same place.
If we were a house party of four we couldn't well see more of them,
and so how could they avoid us, even if they did want to, poor
things!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but that's the point: Do you think they want to?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen any sign of it. They're always cordial and he's
always interesting. Where'd you get the idea?"</p>

<p>Claire shook her head. "I don't know, unless it's that troubled
expression she has when she looks at me. Once or twice I've thought
she wanted to speak to me alone&mdash;she had that manner&mdash;but
she doesn't. Then of course there's another thing rather
queer."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it could hardly be a coincidence."</p>

<p>"What couldn't?"</p>

<p>Claire looked at her mother searchingly. "Have you noticed how
much more constantly she's with him than she was at first?"</p>

<p>"Is she?"</p>

<p>"She's with him absolutely all the time he's out of his room.
She used to leave him, for an hour or so, quite often; but now she
never does. It's as if she didn't want to leave him
alone&mdash;alone with anybody else. I haven't been alone with him
since I don't know how long!"</p>

<p>"My dear child! Why should you be alone with him? It strikes me
you say some pretty personal things to him under conditions that
might almost be called semi-public! I don't know <i>much</i> more
you could do if you were alone with him; and the poor man himself
looks troubled enough when you do it, as it is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Claire said dreamily. "Do you think perhaps
she has a kind of sisterly jealousy of me?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Mrs. Ambler replied with emphasis. "She isn't
that type at all. She's a good woman, generous I'm sure; and she
thinks of nothing in the world but her brother's welfare. By the
way, speaking of welfare, the season here is getting rather late.
Don't you think it's about time we were on our way back to Paris,
as we planned? We've already been here a month longer than we
intended to be when we came."</p>

<p>"Oh, Paris!" the daughter said impatiently. "I don't care if I
never see Paris again!"</p>

<p>"We can't stay here into the very hot weather. Nobody does."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Claire murmured, and sat frowning. "Surely she
can't think that keeping me from ever being alone with him would do
his welfare any good. I've told her myself that I'd do anything in
the world for him."</p>

<p>"You told her that, Claire?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Claire said, and her softened eyes grew bravely moist,
even under her mother's direct gaze. "I told her I'd give my life
to be of any use to him. Then why does she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler, herself troubled, shook her head. "I don't know,
Claire."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she believed me. It's true&mdash;I would give my life
in an instant. Mother, she <i>must</i> have believed me!"</p>

<p>This insistence implied a doubt that need not have existed; the
Englishwoman had believed her, and at that same hour was forth upon
an errand she would otherwise have spared herself. Having left her
brother drowsing in his cell, Miss Orbison trudged sturdily through
the long stone great street of Raona, passed under the archway of
the ancient town gates, and went on for some hundreds of paces
beyond the ruined medieval walls. Then she paused at the panelled
green doorway of an enclosed garden, and pulled vigorously upon an
iron chain. A rusty bell that hung upon a wrought-iron hoop above
the door rang as heartily as she seemed to desire.</p>

<p>When the door opened, a swarthy little maid in an old-fashioned
Raonese peasant's costume appeared, a brilliant scarf about her
dark head, a striped red-and-white shawl over her black bodice, gay
embroideries encrusting her long green skirt. She stood smiling and
bowing archly in the doorway. "<i>Buon'giorno, signora</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Il signore  in casa?</i>" Miss Orbison asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, signora. Prego!</i>" Then the little creature,
barefooted, ran up the garden terraces to the white villa above,
and disappeared within a Saracen doorway. This was the entrance to
the studio, Miss Orbison knew, and by the time she had ascended to
it, Eugene Rennie had come out of it to welcome her.</p>

<p>"You're painting?" she asked. "I'm interrupting?"</p>

<p>He would have liked to tell her the truth, which was that he
wanted to go on working; but having taken note of her expression,
he said that he had finished for the day; and they sat down
together upon the wide marble steps of the topmost terrace.</p>

<p>"Something about Charles?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's no worse?"</p>

<p>"Of course every hour he's an hour worse," she said with a
tremor in her voice; but she controlled it manfully. "He doesn't
look worse, hour by hour&mdash;he couldn't well do that&mdash;but
no matter how he looks, the end of his suffering is always just
that much nearer in sight. The pain is never unbearable, and often
he's hardly conscious of it&mdash;perhaps because he's so used to
it. The doctors told me precisely how it would be, and everything's
confirmed them; I never doubted they were right. If only that
specialist hadn't told <i>him</i>!" She stretched her gloved hands
convulsively in her lap, then sighed loudly and relaxed them. "But
there! It's done, and we have to make the best of it; but that
isn't what I've come to you about."</p>

<p>"You know I'll do anything," Rennie said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you will. I'm afraid I'm here to ask you to do
something difficult."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember one morning when you and Charles and I were
watching Miss Ambler and Don Arturo Liana as they sat by the
railing of the hotel garden, and Charles looked so absurdly
depressed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he seemed gloomy about Arturo's filling Miss Ambler's
heart. I was delighted."</p>

<p>"I was rather pleased myself, Mr. Rennie. I thought it would be
good for him to take a little interest in her, like that."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it has?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "If it had remained a little interest we'd have
been right to be pleased." She shook her head. "It hasn't."</p>

<p>"No?" Rennie looked puzzled. "You don't think he's serious about
her?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's dangerously liable to be serious about
her."</p>

<p>"'Dangerously,' Miss Orbison? You mean it might be dangerous for
him to care for a rather flirtatious and light-headed young
creature who doesn't care for him?"</p>

<p>"No. It's because she does care for him."</p>

<p>Rennie looked astonished. "You think she does?"</p>

<p>"She's as much as told me so, and she was in earnest. She cares
for him as deeply as it's in her nature to care at her age, I'm
quite positive; and that's what is cruelly dangerous for
Charles."</p>

<p>"You think he could be really in love with her, do you?"</p>

<p>"He's trying with all his poor broken strength not to be," she
answered unhappily. "Do you understand why he tries not to be in
love with her? Do you understand why he <i>mustn't</i> be, Mr.
Rennie?"</p>

<p>"A little&mdash;perhaps," he said doubtfully. "But it's the very
breath of romance to believe that the happiness found in mutual
love makes even tragedy celestial."</p>

<p>Miss Orbison projected an audible sniff from her nostrils. "Yes;
it's the 'very breath of romance,' and it's a wicked nonsense for
human beings to believe it enough to act upon it! Don't you see
that Charles understands, and that he's trying to save
himself?"</p>

<p>"From what?"</p>

<p>"From agony, Mr. Rennie. From an absolutely useless and futile
agony. We'll look at it in a plain way&mdash;a matter-of-fact way,
if you please&mdash;without any romance. He'd got through the worst
of it when we came here; he'd no chance but to accept, and he was
fairly well resigned to it. He'd been through his rebellion and he
knew rebellion was no good. Sometimes you could see a little of it
left&mdash;in his eyes, or in some impatient thing he said; but
he'd nevertheless accepted what he knew was absolute and
inevitable. He has it fixed in his mind that the end will be in the
autumn; October, he thinks&mdash;he's spoken of it several times.
Well, he'd made himself almost placid about it. He'd loved life in
the natural way most of us love it; but after all he felt he hadn't
a great deal to live for. The war had shut his career off short;
and for people near his heart he had only some friends&mdash;and
me." She paused for a moment and her stout shoulders stiffened.
"Well, a man can bear to die and leave a sister, Mr. Rennie."</p>

<p>Rennie nodded sympathetically. "Yes."</p>

<p>"If he had fallen a little in love with this pretty young
thing," she went on, "and if the girl hadn't cared for him, it
wouldn't have mattered; it might even have helped him not to mind
dying. But for him to see that she adores him&mdash;and I'm afraid
she does&mdash;for him to recognize the fact that he cares for her
and to find life offering him what he'd believe a glittering,
glorious happiness in almost the moment when he has to be done with
life forever&mdash;oh!" Miss Orbison cried. "That would be
horrible, Mr. Rennie!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Rennie said. "I think it would. The pain would outweigh
the happiness."</p>

<p>"'Happiness,' Mr. Rennie? Charles knows it wouldn't be happiness
at all; he knows it would be an unspeakable anguish to take this
new beautiful thing into his life only to be wrenched from it! He's
trying so hard to spare himself that. He can bear dying; but he
can't bear dying unbearably! He's doing everything he can to avoid
believing that the girl cares for him and that he cares for her.
You see, it's her caring that is the peril. If he could believe her
what we thought her at first, just a light-hearted young coquette
flirting with these queer Raonese men and handsome boys like Liana,
and not seriously troubling her head about <i>him</i>, he could
still keep his grasp upon the resignation he feels slipping from
him. It's she who's getting it away from him. I've done all I could
to help him, to give her no opportunities to make him see what he
tries so hard not to see. But she makes it more and more clear in
spite of me, and in spite of Charles, Mr. Rennie."</p>

<p>"You depict her as pretty brazenly forward, Miss Orbison."</p>

<p>But the sturdy Englishwoman was just. "No," she said. "Those
things are different nowadays&mdash;customs have changed and
anyhow, you see, it's rather chivalrous of her. I don't think she
understands much about Charles; she doesn't know his time is so
short; but she sees that he's a cripple and wouldn't ask anybody to
marry him. She does the courting because of that and because she
wants to make the sacrifice. I haven't a doubt she'd eagerly and
happily devote her life to nursing him,&mdash;indeed I think she'd
do anything for him. And she must do something for him, Mr. Rennie.
She must!"</p>

<p>"What do you want her to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Orbison rose. "I want her to let my brother die in peace,
Mr. Rennie. Will you ask her? Will you make it clear to her? I've
tried&mdash;but I couldn't even begin; I'd have done nothing but
cry if I'd tried to go any further with her. Will you do it, Mr.
Rennie?"</p>

<p>In return, he asked her a question as serious. "Do you think
it's possible for anyone to make such a thing clear to a girl of
twenty-one in love?"</p>

<p>Miss Orbison looked up at him desperately. "We've got to
<i>try</i>, haven't we? Will you try?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I'll go this afternoon."</p>

<p class="cpb">XVIII.</p>

<p>HE WATCHED her short, strong figure as it descended the long
flight of steps that separated his garden terraces and led to the
green doorway. When she had gone out, he could see her gray felt
hat below the top of the wall as she strode on toward the old gates
and the town; and he sighed for her and the stout heart she carried
so bravely in her stout body. Then he sighed for himself and the
disturbing errand she had set him upon, and went indoors to change
his clothes.</p>

<p>When he came forth again, he paused at the top of the steps. The
point was high, and commanded the immense sweep of that great
crescenting mountain coast. Below him the gray road wound out of
the towered and cubed and angled stone masses of the town, and
passed toward the vast corrugations of the volcano's buttresses;
there were stolid hamlets built of old lava among the convulsive
shadows of these harsh slopes; and halfway to the nearest there was
a haze of dust upon the road. It was moving toward Raona, and
within it there were glints of glitter and colour. Rennie
distinguished the uniforms of mounted <i>carabinieri</i>. He stood
looking down as they drew nearer, and he saw that two of the
<i>carabinieri</i> rode in advance of a mule cart, with three
others riding upon each side of it and two more just behind.
Following them, a dozen or more men joggled along upon mules or
donkeys, and a straggling little crowd of barefooted peasants ran
in the dust&mdash;attendant spectators anxious to miss nothing.</p>

<p>Looking down from above, Rennie could see, upon a mattress in
the cart, a bandaged figure; and seated upon a stool beside it, a
man in gray linen clothes smoked a cigarette. The American
recognized him as a friend of his, a Raonese surgeon. Moreover,
beside the driver sat a priest.</p>

<p>Rennie ran down the steps, and, as this cortege passed, he
detained one of the runners, a villager whom he knew.</p>

<p>"Luigi! For what reason so much excitement? Who has been
hurt?"</p>

<p>Luigi wiped his wet brow with a bare forearm. "An accident," he
said, panting. "An accident of a peculiar appearance, it might be
thought. This morning some of our people found Don Arturo Liana
lying at the foot of the Salto. The Salto is a very bad little
cliff&mdash;it is little but wicked, and foreigners should not use
that path."</p>

<p>"Liana!" Rennie exclaimed. "Was he badly hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, badly. His mother was sent for and she came with the
priest, the <i>carabinieri</i> and the doctor from Raona, four
hours ago. She has gone ahead in her automobile and they are taking
him to the hospital in the cart because he must be kept lying down.
Don Arturo talked to the <i>carabinieri</i> and to the doctor; I
heard him myself, through a window. He told them he was walking to
a meeting at Castrogirone last night, all alone. Ah! I think he
should have been more careful! He said he met some men on the path,
but in the darkness he could not tell who they were; he said
perhaps they had too much wine. Don Arturo is a brave fellow; I
willingly say as much as that for him. He is a foreigner from the
North; but he understands the customs of our country and of course
he would not tell the <i>carabinieri</i> who pushed him off the
path."</p>

<p>"So!" Rennie said. "Who <i>did</i> push him off the path,
Luigi?"</p>

<p>Luigi opened his eyes until they showed an extreme amount of
white below and above their topaz irises. "'Pushed,' signore! Who
spoke of any pushing?"</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"No, no!" Luigi protested. "When a man has such enemies as those
belonging to Don Arturo Liana, no one is foolish enough to say the
young gentleman was pushed from anywhere! Excuse, signore!"</p>

<p>Rennie let him go and he ran away, his brown bare feet flitting
lightly over the gray dust. He had caught up with the ragged end of
the procession before it passed through the gates; but the American
went more slowly. Inside the town, he walked first to the wine shop
of old Onorati, who had the habit of knowing the truth of whatever
happened in Raona; but of course Onorati would not speak plainly to
a foreigner of Don Arturo's fall from the Salto.</p>

<p>"Some will swear one way; some will swear another," he said.
"The only thing it is safe to swear is that Don Arturo ought not to
have walked so far alone after the dark!"</p>

<p>"No," Rennie returned dryly. "That is evident."</p>

<p>"Evident? Perhaps. He is in politics."</p>

<p>"So? You think it was political?"</p>

<p>"Who can say? Somewhere there was a whispering&mdash;" Onorati
stopped, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Yes? What was the whispering?"</p>

<p>"It could not be true, I am sure; but there was some foolish
whispering that Don Arturo had talked a little recklessly of some
gentlemen; but I heard nothing that would permit me to guess who
the gentlemen are."</p>

<p>"What had he said of them?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows."</p>

<p>"To whom did he talk?"</p>

<p>Onorati rubbed his right cheek and then his left cheek. "Ah,
yes! I remember hearing that it might have been to some foreign
ladies at the convent."</p>

<p>By the "convent" he meant the hotel that had been a monastery,
and Eugene Rennie, on his way there, stopped halfway down a flight
of stone steps, and made a sound as of a dolorous kind of laughter.
Then he questioned himself upon this very sound. "Why the devil
will a man do that?" he asked himself. "How is it that one is able
to see something grotesquely humorous even in a tragedy? In this
one, probably because the character of the heroine makes it a
tragi-comedy&mdash;with the emphasis on the first half of the word,
I'm afraid. <i>Avanti</i>, then, for my own miserable part in
it!"</p>

<p>The concierge informed him that Miss Ambler was in the garden,
and Rennie went there at once to find her. Miss Orbison had just
brought her brother out to his chair. He was standing, leaning upon
the back of it, and beside him was the American girl. Miss Orbison
had paused with an unfolded rug hanging from her hands; and all
three of them wore the pained and incredulous look of people who
have just heard startling news. This, in fact, was their condition,
for the Princess Liana stood facing them.</p>

<p>Rennie halted where he was.</p>

<p class="cpb">XIX.</p>

<p>SHE was naturally a pale woman, of a uniform whiteness of
complexion that Rennie, who was an old friend of hers, had never
seen varied; but he saw a variation now. Her whole face showed
colour; it was flushed to a tint between rose and rust; and she
held this emotional face high, too, with her chin lifted and her
slim neck straight upon her slim straight body. She was speaking to
Claire in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"My son send me," the princess said. "I would not have come
myself. They wish' to give him an opiate for his suffering; but he
say to me he will not take it if I will not promise to come to
speak to you immediately. So I speak to you his message. He wish'
me to tell you that what has happen' to him is from politics. He
say you mus' not think there was any other cause. He say you might
be afraid there was some other reason; he say you mus' not belief
so. That is what he send me to tell you and I have told you, Miss
Ambler; so now I will go back to him."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;please!" Claire cried. "Will you let me go with you?
Would he let me see him?"</p>

<p>"No!" the princess answered sharply. "You could not see him.
What do you think? A man all beaten and crush' wish' to be
coquetted with? <i>I</i> would not let you see him, Miss Ambler.
You have made him unhappy enough and you have done him harm enough;
I hope from the deeps of my heart that he will never in his life
see you again!"</p>

<p>She turned quickly, and as she walked toward the doorway of the
hotel, she came near Rennie. He stepped forward, and she gave him
her hand.</p>

<p>"We are not going to let him die," she said. "They have already
promise' me that."</p>

<p>"I heard you say Arturo was beaten&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was. When they finish', they threw him down from the Salto.
Everyone know' who is responsible. But there will be no court.
Arturo has some friends who know very well what to do!"</p>

<p>Then, with a sombre flash of her dark eyes to his troubled blue
ones, she went on; and he joined the group at the invalid's
chair.</p>

<p>Claire was weeping. "You know it's true!" she said accusingly to
Orbison. "Anybody with any intelligence at all knows he wouldn't
have sent that message to me if he'd believed it himself!
<i>She</i> didn't believe it! She made it plain enough, didn't she?
She meant that her son sent me that message because he wanted me
not to be so wretched as I would be if I thought I'd been the
cause, and to make me understand that my name wouldn't be involved.
Didn't she mean just that? She made it plain enough how she hates
me, didn't she? Yes! And <i>you're</i> making something else pretty
plain, Mr. Orbison!"</p>

<p>"I?" Orbison leaned more heavily upon the chair. "What am I
making plain?"</p>

<p>Claire came close to him, facing him; she disregarded the
others. "You know!" she said. "You've thought from the first I was
getting him into trouble. You said so, and you as much as said I
was a little fool. You did!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did!" she said passionately. "You thought it! You've
thought all along that I was nothing but a little fool and now you
think it's <i>proved</i>! That's what you're making plain to me,
Mr. Orbison, just as she made it plain how she hates me! Do you
think I don't <i>see</i> it?"</p>

<p>Orbison answered her sharply. "There's a rather badly smashed
young man down yonder in that hospital on the road to the sea," he
said. "It seems to me you might be more concerned with him than
with other people's opinion of you."</p>

<p>Claire stepped back from him so quickly and awkwardly that it
was almost as if she staggered, while her right arm and shoulder
oddly made a semblance of the gesture of one who strives to shield
his head from harm. And with that she began to weep aloud. "Oh!"
she said. "I see! You hate me for&mdash;for not <i>wanting</i> you
to think I'm just a little fool! Well&mdash;all right!" She began
to walk away; but she did not go all the distance to the hotel
doorway. She stopped, came back toward Orbison; and, in a broken
voice, pathetically sweet, like that of a quietly sobbing child, "I
don't care!" she said. "You&mdash;you did like <i>one</i> thing
about me. I never meant to tell you, but you did like one thing I
did. I did it for you. You said&mdash;you said it gave you
the&mdash;the loveliest moment in the&mdash;in the greatest hour of
beauty you'd ever known. It was&mdash;it was I that sang at the
Greek theatre for you. And anyway, you <i>did</i> say&mdash;you
<i>did</i> say you liked <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Then, her slender shoulders heaving with the sobs that came
faster and more convulsively as she went, she ran to the doorway
and disappeared within that portal of the ancient house of refuge
from the world.</p>

<p>Miss Orbison helped her brother to let himself down into his
chair, where he reclined, sighing, with a hand over his eyes; but
immediately she made a sign to Eugene Rennie, and walked to a
little distance.</p>

<p>"I thought what you promised me might not be necessary," she
said hurriedly, as the American joined her. "I thought the poor
foolish little thing had done it herself and saved us the trouble,
when Charles spoke to her like that. He did make it pretty plain
that he saw how absurdly self-centred she was, I must say! I
thought then there might be no need for you to speak to her; but
since she told him she was the person who sang at the Greek
theatre, I'm afraid you must do it. He's talked of it again and
again; nothing in his life ever made such an impression on him as
that voice, and now he knows it was <i>hers</i>&mdash;well, I'm
afraid you must go ahead, Mr. Rennie. You'll try to make her
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said dejectedly. "I suppose so."</p>

<p>He waited an hour; then he went to the door of the cell used as
a salon by Mrs. Ambler and her daughter, and knocked.</p>

<p>Claire was there alone.</p>

<p>"My poor dear child," he said as he came in. "Do you think you
could stand a lecture on invalids and what's good for
them&mdash;from a fellow countryman?"</p>

<p>She looked at him gently. "My mother's been wanting us to go
away," she said. "That's what you mean, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="cpb">XX.</p>

<p>THE little salon was between the two bedrooms, and both mother
and daughter slept with their doors open, because of a nervousness
Mrs. Ambler felt about her heart. This was an organ without defect;
but she was ill-persuaded of its soundness, and customarily spoke
of various indigestions she had suffered as "heart attacks." She
was apprehensive of such an attack coming upon her in the night,
and wished to be able, even with a voice stricken possibly almost
to a whisper, to summon her daughter.</p>

<p>Thus, that last night of theirs in Raona, Mrs. Ambler not only
could have spoken to Claire in little more than a whisper, but she
could also hear a sound as small as that from her daughter's room;
and, waking suddenly, toward morning she did hear such a sound. She
listened for a little while; then she spoke.</p>

<p>"Claire, are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you crying?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It sounds like it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not," the daughter insisted.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you would," Mrs. Ambler said. "I should think
you'd be glad to leave a place where they do such awful things as
those ruffians did to poor young Mr. Liana. And you needn't cry
over him, either. He's perfectly certain to get well."</p>

<p>"I told you I wasn't crying."</p>

<p>"I think you're very foolish. You know you adore Paris."</p>

<p>"I'm not crying!"</p>

<p>"Very well," Mrs. Ambler said. "How long have you been awake
like that?"</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well what I mean. For heaven's sake, stop
that crying and try to get some sleep!"</p>

<p>Claire's voice became petulant. "Please let me alone,
Mother!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambler sighed and let her alone. No one else could have
known in the morning how desolately her daughter had wept, most of
the night. Above all, no one would have guessed such a thing of
Claire at noon when Miss Orbison came for her and took her to the
invalid's cell to say good-bye to him.</p>

<p>He sat by the open window listening absently to the talk of his
friend Rennie; the air out over the garden beyond them was bright
with the strong spring sunshine; but nothing anywhere was brighter
than the eyes of the American girl as she came in and gave them
greeting. She was charming, in her lively Parisian travelling dress
of blue silk, as knowingly scant as any other of her dresses; her
slim and rakish black slippers glittered below the fine long shapes
of silk stockings that left some doubt of their being stockings at
all; her silken blue helmet disclosed just two small curved glints
of her fair hair before her hidden ears; and at her waist she wore
a cluster of diminutive fresh pink roses.</p>

<p>She spoke first to Rennie: "So sweet of you to send me these!"
She touched her bouquet as she sat down between the two men. "The
nicest possible bits of Raona one could take away! I'll keep them,
Mr. Rennie; and when you come to New York, some day, if you want a
reminder of your lovely garden here, I'll show them to you."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Orbison said. "That's another advantage owning a
villa gives a chap over one who merely sojourns at a hotel&mdash;a
villa can have a garden. There isn't a florist in Raona,
unfortunately."</p>

<p>"Mr. Orbison!" Claire laughed. "I'll remember you without your
sending me a going-away <i>corsage</i>!"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"You know darn well I will!" she said gayly. "I've certainly
been brazen enough in showing you the devastating impression you
made on me from the first. I've really pursued you in the most
unmaidenly way, and I'm afraid I'd keep right on doing it if we
were going to stay any longer. Fortunately for you, my mother's
been simply dying for weeks to get back to Paris, and yesterday
evening she reached such a climax of rebellion she just broke my
spirit and I gave in. Lucky for you, I did!"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I don't think that's very lucky for me, Miss
Ambler."</p>

<p>"What? Not even after the scene I made yesterday afternoon
because you scolded me for something I darn well deserved to be
scolded for? You don't think you're lucky, even after that?"</p>

<p>"No," he said slowly. "Not even after&mdash;anything!"</p>

<p>For an instant, as he said this, she looked startled; then she
laughed. "Well, then <i>I'm</i> the lucky one to be going, Mr.
Orbison."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," she answered merrily, in the manner of a little
belle who coquettes with her grandfather, "if I stayed much longer
I might be getting <i>too</i> serious about you! Just think how far
it's gone with me already!"</p>

<p>"Has it?"</p>

<p>"'<i>Has</i> it!' Dear me! Didn't I confess to you yesterday I
sang the Pastorale that night at the Greek theatre absolutely for
you? I did! Absolutely! If you don't believe me, you can ask my
mother. I told her when I came home that night; and this is the
honest truth, Mr. Orbison. I said, 'That nice Mr. Orbison was there
and he hasn't taken the trouble to meet us; I think maybe he would
if he knew I sang the Pastorale just to make him!'" And with that
her laughter tinkled out in childlike merriment. "But it didn't
make you. After all my trouble! If I hadn't eavesdropped when you
were talking to your sister I'd never even have known you liked it
at all!"</p>

<p>"'Liked it,'" he repeated. "I'm glad you eavesdropped, because
you know what I felt about it better than if I'd said the same
things to you. It was the most beautiful thing that's ever been in
my life; and it remains that, Miss Ambler, as long as I have any
life. I hope you'll always remember my"&mdash;he faltered, then
finished huskily&mdash;"my gratitude for it."</p>

<p>Then, though only during an instant, her eyes wavered from their
careless-seeming gayety. There was a flickering in her expression
as of some portended sharp change in it; but the instant passed.
"Well, I'm glad," she said; and she flashed to him the side-long
insouciant glance, merry and brilliant, of the confessed coquette
admitting the worst of her coquetries and impudently claiming the
worst of them to be pretty. "Of course Arturo Liana was <i>with</i>
me there, and <i>he</i> felt a little gratitude, <i>too</i>, Mr.
Orbison!"</p>

<p>Orbison's troubled expression altered into something like a
wondering dismay; but he contrived to laugh. "Everybody was
grateful. You mustn't think I took so beautiful a thing as that all
to myself just because you said it was!"</p>

<p>Claire seemed to be as light-headed as she was light-hearted.
"Murder! What I <i>said</i>? My mother tells me, I don't know how
many times a day, that if I had to be held responsible for
everything I <i>say</i>, I'd be guillotined! But don't you think I
didn't mean a great big <i>part</i> of it, for you, Mr. Orbison; I
did, honestly! Honestly, I thought of you while I was singing it
and wondered if you liked it, and <i>that's</i> true anyhow,
absolutely!"</p>

<p>She jumped up briskly and put forth her hand to Miss Orbison.
"Good-bye. If you ever <i>do</i> come to New York, remember, you've
promised on your word of honour to let us know. Mr.
Rennie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to be at the station," he said. "We'll say good-bye
there."</p>

<p>"How lovely of you!" She turned to Orbison, and he took her
extended hand in his cold long fingers. "Good-bye," she said
cheerfully. "You've been absolutely sweet to Mother and me; I'm
going to read Plato and everything. I hope you won't forget us
quite."</p>

<p>"No," he murmured. "I'll never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're lovely to say so," she said. "We won't forget you
either. I never will, Mr. Orbison. Good-bye&mdash;and thank all of
you for everything!"</p>

<p>Her cheeriness continued till the door had closed upon her and
the continuously accompanying sound of half-laughter with which she
expressed her high cordiality. But Rennie thought her voice had
shaken a little when she said, "I never will, Mr. Orbison"; and
Orbison himself, as he sank down upon his chair, had a disturbing
impression that her hand had trembled within his loose and feeble
clasp.</p>

<p>He sat staring out of the window, while his friend, watching
him, thought the look upon his face the most deeply puzzled, and
yet the most melancholy, he had ever seen upon it. Eugene Rennie's
own look, as Orbison did not observe, was one of growing doubt and
sharp compunction&mdash;the look of a man who finds himself
involved in what he fears may prove to be, in the end, a grave
mistake.</p>

<p>Miss Orbison had no such expression. She was serious, but not
doubtful; and she began briskly to talk casual commonplaces with
the anxious caller.</p>

<p>He stayed with them half an hour longer; then got to his feet,
saying that it was time for him to be on his way to the
station.</p>

<p>Orbison, who had not spoken since Claire left the room, turned
his head and stared vaguely at his departing friend.</p>

<p>"We didn't find out, Eugene," he said.</p>

<p>"Didn't find what out?"</p>

<p>"We didn't find out what was in that pretty little head. And now
we'll never know; but I'm sure&mdash;I'm sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"In spite of all her lightness and her self-centred
youthfulness&mdash;" Orbison paused again; then he said, "I'm sure
it was something fine and sweet&mdash;in spite of anything!"</p>

<p class="cpb">XXI.</p>

<p>THE station at Raona is by the water, and the road down from the
great cliff to the sea level is one that in a photograph seems to
be an interminable gray ribbon strewn back and forth upon the
landscape. Rennie drove down in a donkey cart he owned, and he was
late. When he arrived upon the platform the passengers were all
aboard and the train was slowly beginning to be in motion. He
looked up and down the length of it, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie! Mr. Rennie!"</p>

<p>Claire had seen him, and she called loudly from the open window
of a <i>wagon-lit</i> compartment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie! <i>Here</i>, Mr. Rennie!"</p>

<p>He looked again, then catching a glimpse of a waving hand, saw
framed in the open window the face he sought. Upon it were the
glistening streaks of heavy tears; but her eyes were wide and
staring with an anxiety more poignant than her grief. The train was
moving faster.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie!" she screamed. "Mr. <i>Rennie!</i>"</p>

<p>He ran toward her, and for a few seconds maintained a pace as
rapid as the train's. She leaned from the window and seized his
uplifted hand.</p>

<p>"Did I get by with it?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes! God bless you!" he cried, and their hands were parted
swiftly.</p>

<p>He stood at the end of the platform and waved his white
handkerchief to her; but in a moment, as she looked back, his
receding figure dwindled and grew tiny, as if he were a mechanical
toy at the end of two long, converging horizontal rods&mdash;a
little doll man, diminishing and waving a doll's white
handkerchief. Above him the vast and broken blue landscape climbed
into the sky, and a hazy curve of the cliff disclosed the gray
monastery set upon its precipice. Thin as a spider's guy lines, the
garden railing ran at the edge, and tiny dark figures stood there,
the size of exclamation points. "Ah, good-bye!" Claire cried.
"Good-bye..."</p>

<p>Her mother pulled her back into her seat. "Do you want to get
your head taken off?"</p>

<p>"It seems so strange," Claire said, and uselessly applied a
soaked handkerchief to her eyes and nose. "It's so <i>strange</i>,
Mother. I don't understand it!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, stop crying! It only makes you talk as if
you had a cold in the head. What don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"It's so strange there'll be <i>people</i> there&mdash;in that
garden&mdash;year after year&mdash;just as <i>we</i> were. They'll
come there and never know anything happened there...There'll be
people there, looking down over that cliff at the sea a hundred
years from now. It's so strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course there'll be people there," Mrs. Ambler said.
"Probably a thousand years from now; they were there a thousand
years ago, and three thousand for that matter. It's an everlasting
sort of place. Do you think it does any good to cry about it?"</p>

<p>But she knew what her daughter was crying about, and her
sharpness was tactful. She said no more, but took up a book and
read, apparently paying no attention to anything else. Claire was
silent, sitting motionless, and, as the afternoon waned, her
mother, glancing at her almost imperceptibly, saw that her eyes
were dry. She was pale, but her breathing was quiet and not
troubled by the little starts and catches that had beset her during
the first hour of their journey.</p>

<p>The train stopped at the seaport town of Castrovecchio; and when
it went on again they heard American voices in the next
compartment&mdash;voices of a mother and her son, it became
evident. A little later, a youth of twenty-four or thereabouts
appeared in the corridor, lounging, enjoying a cigarette and
looking out of the window opposite the Amblers' open door. He was
tall, of an athlete's figure, comely of face, well-advised in
dress, and his air was that of a carefree and generally amused
person. After a time his observation wandered, and he was aware of
the girl sitting in the compartment outside of which he took his
pleasure. His awareness of her, indeed, was vivid, almost fervent.
He looked full ready to be cordial.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "Does my smoking annoy you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mrs. Ambler assured him.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" he asked earnestly. "Does it annoy you in the
least?"</p>

<p>"No. It doesn't come into the compartment; it blows the other
way."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be glad to throw my cigarette away," he said. "I
will if it annoys either of you." He looked anxiously at Claire and
added: "Are you sure it doesn't annoy either of you?"</p>

<p>Claire did not even look toward him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, still hopefully earnest, "if you're sure you
<i>both</i> don't mind it&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that, Mrs. Ambler was a little amused with him and a little
embarrassed; then, looking at her silent and motionless daughter,
she was stirred by a faint anxiety. Claire's eyes, staring straight
before her at the wall of the compartment, seemed to express a
dangerous hostility.</p>

<p>"No, no! Neither of us minds it at all," Mrs. Ambler said
hastily; whereupon, after coughing and murmuring, "Well&mdash;" he
moved away. They heard him speaking a few minutes later when he had
rejoined his mother. The train had stopped at a village, and in the
silence his voice, though not loud, was more audible than he knew.
"Americans, yes. Frostiest looking girl I ever saw!"</p>

<p>He was not wholly discouraged, however; for after they were in
motion again, he reappeared in the corridor, and the two ladies
were conscious that upon the slightest sign to indicate they knew
of his existence he would offer them the entertainment of
conversation. Mrs. Ambler timidly considered offering the sign; but
a glance at her daughter dismayed her.</p>

<p>"See here," the mother said, when the young man had again been
frosted into a departure. "I hope you aren't going to keep this up
too long, Claire."</p>

<p>"Keep what up?"</p>

<p>"Now, now!" Mrs. Ambler protested. "There wouldn't be anything
out of the way in letting that good-looking boy talk to you. He
seems very nice indeed, and as he and his mother are probably going
all the way through, I don't see&mdash;" She paused. "It might help
you to get out of yourself a little."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be got out of myself."</p>

<p>"Now, now!" Mrs. Ambler said again, and she smiled, though not
unsympathetically. "You don't think this is going to last, do you,
dear&mdash;at your age? How long do you suppose it will be before
you'll be interested in seeing something of pleasant young
gentlemen again?"</p>

<p>"I never will," Claire said. "Never."</p>

<p>"But if only on your own account you ought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Claire interrupted. "On their account is what I mean."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! You haven't become precisely poison to
gentlemen, my child!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Claire said, in a dead voice. "That's all I am."</p>

<p>Her mother urged no more, and the unhappy girl sat staring
frozenly at the polished wall before her. Her thoughts were long
and sorrowful, and after a while they became bitter, as well. The
persistent youth returned once more to the corridor, and although
he affected a manner of interest in his cigarette and the
landscape, she was unable not to be conscious of his ever-hopeful
consciousness of herself. "Idiot!" she thought, addressing him.
"Miserable sleek-haired little idiot! Thinking your awful prattle
could be endured for an instant! Haven't you got eyes?"</p>

<p>She blamed him fiercely for not seeing her as she pictured
herself to herself. In the autumn she had seen Clothilde Berin, the
Parisian actress, play an abysmal tragedy. Mlle. Berin was a tall
black-and-white woman with gloomy black eyes under black brows,
and, in the final scene of the drama, she sat, in black mourning,
staring hollowly straight before her, over the heads of the
audience, into an eternity of pain. And thus, to Claire, it seemed
now that she herself appeared. She forgot her charming little
dress, her pinkish gray stockings, her jaunty blue hat, and even
her roses from Raona. What she imagined the young man in the
corridor would see&mdash;if he had eyes!&mdash;was a long,
black-haired, black-eyed, black-clad woman with a dead white skin,
staring forever before her. Couldn't the idiot recognize a tragedy
when he saw it?</p>

<p>Then, with horror, she realized that her two natures were in
conflict again; the tricky and malicious artist was at work within
her even now, when she was in the midst of the deepest suffering
she had ever known. In spite of her true anguish, she was thinking
of herself as picturesque; and she was indignant with a cub of a
boy, whom she had never seen before, because he did not perceive
how picturesque she really was! And thus she reached the bottom of
her despair. "No wonder I do such harm!" she thought. "My very soul
is artificial&mdash;and hideous!"</p>

<p>But at night she lay in her berth in the train that still sped
roaring northward&mdash;endlessly northward&mdash;and the
desperation of her will to return was so great that, conscious of
her own absurdity, she entreated the iron tracks beneath her to
change their course, curve backward and bring her again, in the
morning, to Raona.</p>

<p>"I've <i>got</i> to go back," she whispered to the soggy little
pillow. "Ah, I want to <i>see</i> him again! I'll only just look at
him. They'd let me do that, wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>Then she knew what she had given up. The morning could not bring
her to Raona but it need bring her no despair of her soul. The
artist within it had behaved not so badly, after all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name='ch3' id="ch3"></a>PART III. "TWENTY-FIVE!"</h2>

<p class="cpb">XXII.</p>

<p>THE endless processions of automobiles, with black tops shiny in
an autumnal drizzle, filled the long avenues of Manhattan, and,
creeping busily between quivering halts, were like armies of
beetles on the march through gloomy ruts in wet stone. Not unlike
detached smaller beetles upright and gesticulating to the greater
were the traffic directors in gleaming black oilskin, while other
imperious coleoptera stood at the awning entrances to apartment
houses, and, as the electric lights came on in the late afternoon,
outlined themselves in dark wet glitterings that became flashingly
active when automobiles drew to the curb. At such times there
seemed to be a deposit of larvae; the hard and darkly shining sides
of the cars opened, emitting plastic beings to be taken in charge,
apparently, by the attendant beetles at the awning ends, and, upon
the fashionable avenues, the larvae were of a superior, tenderer
kind;&mdash;delicate things, exquisitely swathed, they were handled
sweetly and hygienically with deferential white gloves.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the deference was anything more than a
hopeful sale of so much manner for proportionate <i>pourboire</i>.
The giant beetle at the awning of the Abercrombie Apartments on
Park Avenue had in his heart no true deference for the larvae
deposited with him, though they were among the most richly and
softly wrapped in all that thoroughfare. "Tea!" he said mockingly
to an official friend, who paused beside him in a relaxed interval.
"They call it 'tea'! If you'd see 'em comin' away from all these
'teas,' about an hour or so from now, you'd like to get hold of a
little of that kind of 'tea' yourself, Charlie."</p>

<p>The policeman laughed admiringly. "Cost about eight dollars a
quart from a bootlegger, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and more. It's a shame," the doorman said bitterly. "You'd
be surprised how much of it they get away with. Yes, and even young
girls! It's the worst waste we've ever had in this country. Now
before prohibition&mdash;" But here he interrupted himself; a
French automobile drew out of the traffic to halt by the awning; he
stepped forward cordially and opened the door. "Yes'm," he said,
not replying to any inquiry. "It's a nasty afternoon. Very nasty,
indeed, ma'am, and it looks like a nasty evening, too. Yes, ma'am,
indeed it does so!"</p>

<p>The policeman glanced with a favourable interest at the emerging
figure; for he knew that his friend spoke so freely of the weather
to only those whom he regarded as important clients. This one,
moreover, had every appearance of being such a client; she
presented to view the slender elegance, completed, not immature, of
a gracefully experienced young lady of the world, and, better
still, she was to be distinguished from previously arriving clients
by something even more ingratiating than her superior comeliness.
Most of the others, too much like larvae, came out of their cars in
a dead-eyed coma; apparently they had to be passed inside the
building and relieved of their swathings before being roused to
complete consciousness;&mdash;this one was already brilliantly
alive; her blue eyes were twinklingly aware of everything and took
note of both the doorman and the policeman as fellow-beings worthy
of cognizance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Winge tells me he thinks it may be the climate, William,"
she said to the former. "Mr. Winge is almost sure the climate has
something to do with the weather."</p>

<p>The policeman was charmed with her. "They ought to make more
like that one," he said, when she had gone briskly into the great,
lighted doorway. "Who was she talkin' about? Her husband?"</p>

<p>"No; she ain't married. This Winge is only a dumb-bell lives
here her and I joke about. He ain't got no chance with her at
all."</p>

<p>"I hope not," the policeman said. "You'd hate to think of one
like that marryin' a dumb-bell. About how old is she, you
think?"</p>

<p>"Miss Ambler?" the doorman returned thoughtfully.
"Well&mdash;prob'ly somewhere around where either they marry a
young feller or else don't, and wait a while and marry a man that's
lost his wife."</p>

<p>"Is she so?" his friend said, amused. "I expect from her looks,
though, she don't feel no great call to be troublin' her head over
that!"</p>

<hr class='tbk100'>

<p>But his surmise was not at all a correct one: Miss Ambler had
been troubling her head about that a great deal of late. In fact,
at this very moment, in the elevator of the Abercrombie, she was
almost acutely troubling her head about it and she had some special
promptings to painful thought upon the subject. The least pressing
of them, it may be explained, as a key to her present state of
mind, was the fact that a previously patient suitor had delivered
an ultimatum: he was to have a favourable answer by nightfall of
to-day or he would henceforth treat her as a stranger, none of her
proposed middle-grounds being possible for him. She found herself
able to endure the prospect of his alienation; but a more serious
matter was involved: she was twenty-four, which is
bearable;&mdash;what began to take her breath was the imminent
approach of her birthday. She had only a fortnight left; then she
would be twenty-five.</p>

<p>Here was a disturbing numeral. For a girl the difference between
twenty-four and twenty-five has a disproportionate importance. In
certain uncomfortable suggestions it may be equal to the difference
made by a whole decade in the life of a young man: for her, the
difference between twenty-four and twenty-five may be what the
difference between twenty-five and thirty-five is for him. In
Claire's mind, at twenty-four, there was a Rubicon before her; and
to cross over, unwed and even unbetrothed, into twenty-five, was
almost crossing over into a definite spinsterhood. Or, if it were
not crossing into a spinsterhood so definite as to be absolute and
permanent, it was crossing into that period of limbo wherein a
maiden waits, ageing, until perchance she marries the relict
widower of a former girl-friend and brings up children not her own.
The doorman had defined Claire's age shrewdly enough.</p>

<p>She had shivered a little upon leaving twenty-three for
twenty-four, as if at the touch of an October breeze in August; yet
autumnal gayety was easily possible for twenty-four. Twenty-four
was not so bad of itself; its sinister quality resided in its
border, and, as she approached nearer and nearer that border, she
more and more often incredulously murmured the dread numeral to
herself, wondering and dismayed to find it upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five!" she thus whispered in the elevator.
"Twenty-<i>five</i>!"</p>

<p>The elevator man did not hear her. What he said was only a
coincidence; her apartment was upon the eighteenth floor.
"Eighteen, Miss Ambler?"</p>

<p>"Twenty, Henry, please."</p>

<p>He nodded affably. "Mrs. Allyngton's, I expect. She seems to be
having quite a tea this afternoon. Quite a tea at Mrs. Allyngton's
this afternoon, Miss Ambler." And he added, in an admiring tone,
though his purpose was merely to make a little more conversation
with this favoured resident: "I was pretty sure you wouldn't miss
it, Miss Ambler. I told Joe; I said 'She'll be back here in time
for it,' I said. 'You'll see,' I said. 'She ain't goin' to let 'em
leave <i>her</i> out when there's anything going <i>on</i>!' I told
him, 'Not Miss Ambler!' I told him."</p>

<p>His passenger made the appreciative murmur of laughter required
by genial manners; but as she stepped out upon the twentieth floor
she was less pleased than she appeared. "Twenty-five!" she
whispered again. But it seemed that even before twenty-five was
actually reached, a girl had to exert herself to keep people from
leaving her out. Her exertions must be somewhat noticeable since
they roused the admiration of the elevator man.</p>

<p class="cpb">XXIII.</p>

<p>IN A CORNER, and a little apart from the general hilarity of
Mrs. Allyngton's "tea," Claire sat asking herself why she made the
exertions. At almost twenty-five, she was able to occupy her mind
seriously with this puzzle and at the same time to produce the
amount of chatter necessary to prevent the two gentlemen attending
her from suspecting that either she or they were less lively than
the liveliest of the party. Simultaneously she could take stock of
everyone in the place, observing swiftly how well or ill such a one
was "looking"; who talked to whom; how Mr. So-and-So's flirtation
with Mrs. Thus-and-Thus progressed; what every woman wore and that
the painted table Mrs. Allyngton had added to the "Regency
treatment" of the apartment was probably spurious.</p>

<p>Most of the women present were young wives about Claire's age;
some of them were several years younger; two or three were a few
years older; and she had known nearly all of them in their previous
state of candidacy for the matrimonial condition. They had passed
out of the preparatory period, and she hadn't; so that her relation
to them was a little like that of a student, still in school, to
former classmates who, after a thrilling Commencement, have become
graduates gloriously preoccupied with their new world. Companion
initiates in an experience superior to hers, they seemed to have
fulfilled their destiny, and to be at last properly and completely
alive; while she, avoided by this common, happy destiny, was left
outside, not yet really alive and never to be, indeed, if that
destiny should still avoid her or she reject it. The latter
alternative was the kinder, and already she knew that some of these
friends were beginning to say of her: "It isn't for lack of
asking."</p>

<p>She was still with them but no longer of them, though they were
obviously as fond of her as ever. They were always pleased to have
their husbands dance with her; and she foresaw that as the years
went by they would find an "odd man" for her whenever they could.
At present she was still almost too amply able to supply the "odd
man," herself; and here she felt another difference between her
condition and that of the graduates: it seemed to her that in spite
of their superior advantages she understood men&mdash;even the
husbands of some of her friends&mdash;better than they did.
Apparently, marriage often involved a kind of blindness.</p>

<p>One of the men now chattering with her, over his third cocktail,
was in reality, Claire thought, a total stranger to his wife, a
pretty woman twittering with a group at Mrs. Allyngton's piano.
This man had tried to kiss Claire the first time he found himself
alone with her, and the only reason he hadn't tried again, she
knew, was that she had thereafter successfully avoided being alone
with him. Two or three of the other men present, she had cause to
be aware, would do the same thing if she gave them half a chance to
hope that they could "get away with it." Another, an immaculate fat
man, had annoyed her with confidential witticisms of double meaning
until she stopped him. These were but sporadic indications of the
nature of the beast, as she realized; but they certainly meant
something; and her deduction was that most men were grosser and
more predatory than their wives suspected. Without effort, she
attracted men&mdash;attracted them sometimes to her own discomfort;
but, in general, and as a woman, she believed that she did not
really like them.</p>

<p>She attracted men, but she no longer attracted boys; she had
been through the experience of perceiving that. With her mother,
she had returned to the Maine coast for the past two summers, and
had found herself "too old" for the Beach Club dances. A person of
fifty, seeing her beside one of the girls who prevailed at these
dances, could not have decided which was the elder: to his eye
Claire showed not any outward sign at all of her maturity; but the
dancing boys knew instantly that she was "too old" for them. Youth
has its own divinations; and, for these boys&mdash;some of them her
own age&mdash;Claire was already an "old girl."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five!" she thought, now, biting again upon this sore
tooth. Twenty-five would make her an "old girl" indeed; but it
should not make her marry. She knew well enough why these women at
Mrs. Allyngton's had married these men. Some of them had married in
a kind of contagion because they were of the marrying age and
because "all the rest" were getting married. Some of them had
dallied, then married almost in a panic, grasping at anything as
they saw "twenty-five," or worse, approaching; she had been a
bridesmaid for "old girls" thus frantically marrying and had shed
tears, really of rage, for them.</p>

<p>Angered but vague, she supposed the whole affair of marriage to
be "something probably biological." The young had to get out of the
nest: the boy learned to forage for himself; but the girl's part
was ignominious: she had to find a forager&mdash;and ride him! A
whole epoch in a woman's life was devoted to the competition, the
struggles against her companions to obtain a
forager;&mdash;hysterically affecting gayety all the while, she
must scramble and fight to get him, never letting him perceive that
it wasn't he who did the scrambling. The elation of newly engaged
girls had sometimes made Claire sick with pity for her sex: it
seemed to her that what she read in the roseate look of the maiden
betrothed was, "<i>I've got mine!</i>"</p>

<p>Having got theirs, they were generous to Claire: they wanted her
to get hers, though she needed no forager and could still choose
which one of several she would take, if she wished. She had been
fortunate enough to have the foragers scrambling for her, indeed;
and what she was resolved to resist was the contagion: she was
bitterly resolved not to be married because "all the rest" were
married or getting themselves married. Almost despairingly, she
asked for a better reason.</p>

<p>A dozen of "all the rest" were here in Mrs. Allyngton's
apartment, this afternoon, and, as she looked at them, she wondered
that such a contagion could reach her from them; for undeniably she
felt it. She was intimate with them, and several of them still
thought of her as "best friend"; but the intimacy was merely habit,
she perceived&mdash;a habit sprung from chance propinquities and
parental associations. She and these best friends of hers had
shared experiences: they had stepped together into the arena and
had formed the intimacies of a band of young gladiators. When they
found themselves pitted against one another they had fought
according to their own code, though most of them had half-forgiven
some rather tricky wounds;&mdash;but what Claire had come more and
more keenly to realize was that she had little true congeniality
with any of them. Why then did she bore herself by remaining
intimate with them? Why did she still make exertions not to be
"left out"? Why on earth had she bothered to come here this
afternoon?</p>

<p>For Mrs. Allyngton's "tea" was only the daily "cocktail party."
The "conversation" was but the noise that mechanically grew louder
and less coherent as the chemical action of gin inevitably operated
the mechanical action of vocal organs. Daily these people met
somewhere to put themselves through these same chemic mechanics:
they seemed to need to drug themselves in order to bear one
another's society, and since they were as dull as that, Claire
thought, what wonder their lives were as chemic mechanical as their
parties! Well, why in the world did she still go to the
parties?</p>

<p>She couldn't answer her own question; but she was certain that
she hadn't come, this afternoon, because Walter Rackbridge would be
here. Mr. Rackbridge was he who had delivered the ultimatum
expiring at nightfall of this same day, and the last person with
whom she desired to hold converse. Yet here he was, a comely, thin,
dark bachelor of thirty with a haggard eye; and, upon his arrival
in Claire's corner, the two attendant gentlemen at once
intelligently went forth to riot mildly in other regions. She was
left tte--tte with him and in an unhappy mood.</p>

<p class="cpb">XXIV.</p>

<p>"YOU'VE decided," he said immediately. "Which is it,
Claire?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, looking at him sadly. "Thoughtful of you,
Walter, to ask me that&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" The young man's face, not hopeful before she spoke,
became gloomier; for correctly he assumed that what she said was an
unfavourable portent. "I suppose you think I might have been more
tactful to inquire by telephone?"</p>

<p>"No," she returned, and she laughed ruefully. "My idea of
tactful is that you'd have made no inquiry at all."</p>

<p>"I see. I should just have let it run on, remaining your
undemanding servant forever. Well, I'm afraid tact will have to go
by the board."</p>

<p>"I dare say. And you with it, Walter?"</p>

<p>"If you send me by the board with it, yes."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, no! I'd never send you. That's
in your own hands: if you go it's because you want to."</p>

<p>"Claire," he said quietly, "I think you've told other men just
that same thing. Probably some of them have been weak enough to
keep on hanging around rather than incur the kind of reproach you
imply."</p>

<p>"What 'reproach'?"</p>

<p>"That they didn't care enough for you to be content with your
liking them. That's a pretty old story, it seems to me, and so far
as I'm concerned it's not helpful. I think you're the cruellest
person I've ever known, Claire."</p>

<p>"Do you?" she said; and her expression, as she looked wearily
away from him, caused his own to become one of desperation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;banal as you think me for saying so." He was
not altogether successful in stifling an actual groan; it became
audible, and that there might be no doubt of his suffering, a dew,
not of the heat, appeared upon his forehead. "You've been genuinely
brutal to me almost from the first," he said. "You're the most
adorable thing in this world, and you know perfectly well that any
man in his senses must see that you are. You knew at the very start
that <i>I</i> thought so; you didn't care at all for me and yet you
deliberately made yourself as enrapturing to me as you could.
You've always done that: you're doing it even now at the very
moment when you intend to tell me I've got to give up my last hope
of you."</p>

<p>"Now?" she asked scornfully. "What am I doing now?"</p>

<p>"You're looking your most beautiful!" He laughed painfully. "You
couldn't even bring yourself to the decency of dressing
unbecomingly or in any way looking less charming&mdash;and I
couldn't possibly find a more damning thing to say of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she murmured. "I think you've said this to me
several times before, Walter."</p>

<p>He caught his breath; then he said quietly, "Yes, the only
novelty about this is that it's the last time. Don't think I'm
unaware of the answer you're going to give me. It's 'no.'"</p>

<p>She continued to look away from him, and did not speak.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" he said, in a voice a little tremulous, after a
silence. "Isn't it 'no'?"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him with a sorrowful gravity. "I told
you more than a year ago that I could never be in love with you,
Walter. You've been pretty nice to me and you know well enough how
much I like you. I like to be with you&mdash;when you're sensible
enough to be just friendly&mdash;and I like to hear music with you:
I even like spending several hours at a time with you&mdash;again
when you're just friendly. Well, that's all, and I can't help it.
You say it's not enough, and I can't help that, either. You say
I've got to promise to marry you or you'll take yourself
permanently out of my orbit. Very well, I'm not going to be married
merely for the sake of being married."</p>

<p>"And if you married me," he said gently, "that's all it would
be?"</p>

<p>She was sorry for him; he was miserable, and she knew that he
had cared for her, truly and well, a long time. Moisture appeared
in her eyes. "Yes, it would," she said. "I'm sorry I ever let you
get started, Walter. That was my fault, it's true; because I could
have stopped you; but I hadn't learned enough to do such things
then. I confess to you that I wanted to charm all the men I could.
There&mdash;I'm letting you see what I've really been like; it
ought to be useful to you."</p>

<p>"Useful!" he groaned. "It only makes me see that you're lovelier
than ever&mdash;for owning up to it." He took a step away, as if to
leave her; then turned back. "Well&mdash;nothing's likely to make
any difference for me? It's all over, is it?"</p>

<p>"Unless you'd like it to stay as it is."</p>

<p>"I can't," he said. "I've tried; but I've either got to win you
or leave you&mdash;and I can't win you. Well&mdash;" He contrived
to form the semblance of a smile. "Good-bye&mdash;dear."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, in a low voice; and to her sudden surprise
she found this parting sharply painful: she had expected to be
relieved, not hurt, by it. She put out her hand impulsively.
"Good-bye&mdash;dear!" she said in little more than a whisper.</p>

<p>At that, he started and looked at her intently; but she released
her hand from his, said hastily, "No! Just good-bye!" and,
crestfallen, he turned away.</p>

<p>He did not go far. Their hostess was already upon them,
convoying a middle-aged gentleman and a girl of eighteen; and
before Walter could evade this anti-climax, Mrs. Allyngton had
seized him by the arm. "I was just coming over to break up the
tte--tte," she said. "Miss Ambler, this is Mr. Sherman Peale.
Walter, this is Miss Peale. There's some music coming and you can
dance with her pretty soon, and in the meanwhile be witty for her.
You can, sometimes, you know! Claire, I'm going to leave Mr. Peale
with you; that's what he wants."</p>

<p class="cpb">XXV.</p>

<p>THAT was what Mr. Sherman Peale wanted, as Claire already
understood. He was a grayish, meagre man with a brown face and
alert bright eyes that had seen a great deal, but were as lively
and unjaded as those of his eighteen-year-old daughter who now
turned aside with the unhappy Walter. Claire catalogued Mr. Peale
as an "interesting" man, for which rating she had previous
information from the public prints. He was an exploring
anthropologist and had just returned to face batteries of
interviewers after a long immersion in the steamy jungles of the
Orinoco, a river of apparently no interest to him at the present
moment. With a breath-taking clarity he explained what did interest
him.</p>

<p>"I saw you the moment my daughter and I came into this room,
Miss Ambler," he said. "Yours was the one face that stood out, and
I knew you were the one person here I wanted to know. I've been
living entirely among savages for several years and I'm afraid I've
thus relapsed into a habit of primitive frankness of speech lost by
our own race some thousands of years ago. Can you stand it?"</p>

<p>"I think perhaps," she said, "I can even equal it."</p>

<p>At that, his youthful eyes glinted forth sparklings of pleasure.
"Well, suppose you give me a sample of your own."</p>

<p>"Of my own frankness?" She laughed, and then, with a light
audacity, she said, "I saw you as you came in, Mr. Peale, and
humbly hoped for a little notice." And, though she should have
blushed to say it, this was the mere truth: she had observed the
advent of the distinguished gentleman, and had instantly thought,
recognizing him, "There's a man I'd like to know!" The reason she
should have blushed was that this thought of hers had been in her
head during her rejection of Walter Rackbridge: the unfortunate
Walter might well have been entitled to all of her thoughts for
those few crucial moments. But no one had quite all of Claire's
thoughts at any moment whatever; she was never wholly free of that
"double" sense of hers, that curse of "seeing" herself as somebody
else, even when she truly suffered. And thus, even while she had
rejected Walter and had said to herself of Sherman Peale, "There's
a man I'd like to know," she had simultaneously been her own
audience, seated aloof and observing the actress. Moreover, as
audience, she had said: "Walter goes. That brown-faced man coming
in and looking at me, could that be He?" And she had let the
brown-faced man become aware for an instant of her eyes upon him;
so here he was&mdash;of course!</p>

<p>"You'll get the notice, Miss Ambler," he said, delighted. "I
hope you can stand it as well as the frankness."</p>

<p>"I think I can. Has it begun?"</p>

<p>"Decisively!" he rejoined; and he went on at once: "After a man
has been cut off a long time from his kind, he comes back to them
as a lonely stranger. My wife used to go with me upon my
expeditions; but since her death I've gone alone. Coming back to
New York has seemed to me the loneliest of all my expeditions,
though it might surprise you to hear me say so, Miss Ambler. I've
moved among crowds of people ever since I landed, two weeks ago;
I've been obliged to make speeches at science association
dinners&mdash;even at other dinners. I've been in a whirl of
lunches and parties and reporters and celebrities; I've even danced
until three in the morning. Yet I've never felt so alone in my
life; it may be nostalgia for swamps and savages, but I don't feel
that I've been in actual human contact with a fellow-being since I
left South America. When I saw you I had a queer thought, and as
you say you can stand savage frankness, I'll tell you what it was.
I thought, 'There's someone who would understand me.'"</p>

<p>"It might be overestimation," Claire said. "But how could you
feel quite so alone with a daughter like that to go about with
you?"</p>

<p>"Kitty? Good heavens! To me she's the greatest stranger of all.
I left her a little schoolgirl of fourteen in her aunt's charge,
and I've come back to find a curiously sophisticated adult person
whose very vocabulary is less open to me than that of some
primitive tribes who express themselves principally in grunts and
squeals. Bless me! I'm afraid I shall never become acquainted with
Kitty. That good-looking youth with her now already knows more
about her, I haven't a doubt, than I ever shall."</p>

<p>Claire's eyes followed his glance to where his daughter sat with
Walter; and to the girl of almost twenty-five Miss Kitty Peale was
no such mystery as her father found her. She was a slim little fair
creature, exquisite peach-bloom in a knowing small gray hat, an
amber-coloured blouse and skirt, the latter perhaps eighteen inches
long, pale yellow silk stockings naturally much in view, and
beautiful amber shoes from the Rue St. Honor&mdash;superb small
works by an artist in footwear and worth preserving in a
collection. She was not inappreciative of them, herself, and, as
she chattered to Walter, sometimes slightly elevated one or the
other of them, bestowing a momentary glance of thoughtful pleasure
upon it from beneath her lovely ashen lashes. Her stockings pleased
her, too, undoubtedly; though she frequently tweaked the little
skirt down to cover part of a knee-cap. She had many such little
fluttery and impulsive gestures, and her voice was also fluttery
and impulsive. She uttered laughter and little outcries as of
surprise throughout her talking, so that she seemed continually to
have an obbligato accompaniment of mirth and wonderment.</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" Claire thought. "That's just what I was like, then.
Poor Walter!"</p>

<p>But, to her surprise, as she glanced at him, Walter seemed less
downcast than she had expected. His equanimity was the more
puzzling to her because she could hear perfectly what the child was
loudly prattling to him. "So you're actually Charlie Rackbridge's
cousin! I know him awf'ly well, really! I think he's perfectly
peachy wonderful&mdash;just as a boy in college, I mean of course.
I went down to both the games he played in before he broke his
collarbone; but of course I'm not wildly collegiate; Charlie's
peachy in his own place, I mean! I never <i>dreamed</i> I'd meet a
cousin of his this afternoon." Here she looked wistfully for one
second into Walter's eyes; then, with an air of mockery, tapped his
arm with the tips of her fingers. "And <i>such</i> a cousin!"</p>

<p>"She's a terrific little belle, I'm afraid," her father said to
Claire. "She has a squadron of boys hanging about and seems to
spare no one. She tells me she prefers 'older men,' and I suppose
she means young gentlemen about as old as the one she's proceeding
to enthrall just now. I haven't a doubt she'll annex him before she
leaves his side and will probably tell me, after we go out, that
she has an engagement with him for the evening. She'll break
several previous ones, incidentally, but she'll patch all that up
later somehow. I'm sure I don't know how she does it."</p>

<p>Claire thoroughly knew how Kitty did it; and she shivered
slightly, remembering how she herself had done it. "There, but for
the grace of God in making me almost twenty-five, walk I!" she
thought; and then hearing what Kitty said next, she was
startled.</p>

<p>"I saw you the minute I came into the place," Kitty chirped
loudly. "And I wondered right away who you were."</p>

<p>At this, Claire perceived that in one detail, at least, even the
grace of God had not granted to twenty-five any superiority over
eighteen. Kitty was beginning with Walter just as her father and
Claire had begun with each other. "Good heavens!" the girl almost
twenty-five said to herself. "Did <i>I</i> do it like this at
eighteen? Am I <i>still</i> doing only the same things I did
then&mdash;endlessly repeating them as long as I can stay in the
ring?" And, dismayed, she wondered if there was any real difference
between her present situation with Mr. Sherman Peale and Kitty's
with Walter Rackbridge. Hadn't Kitty probably asked herself, at
first sight of Walter, "Is this He?" She indeed probably had! And
just as Claire was already certain that if she chose she could make
Mr. Peale take any amount of interest in her she thought desirable,
wasn't the eighteen-year-old girl capable of a like certainty in
regard to Walter? "Not that Walter would," Claire thought; and
then, hearing his response to Kitty's overture, she had another
surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you wondered," he said gravely. "I think I'd like to
be wondered about&mdash;by you&mdash;very much."</p>

<p>Claire stared at him incredulously, for he seemed to mean what
he said; and she remembered how quickly desolated gentlemen are
caught, sometimes, on the rebound. This thought disturbed her, not
because she was at all a dog in the manger, or could be jealous of
another's seizing upon what she, herself, rejected, but because she
had a liking for Walter that was almost a fondness, and she admired
him. His native talent and a genius for work had made him one of
the best young architects in New York; he was kind, generous and
able&mdash;a man much too good to be caught on the rebound by an
eighteen-year-old bit of peach-bloom. And here Claire consoled
herself with a difference between eighteen and twenty-five. "Never
a thought in that little head except about herself&mdash;not one!
She's making poor old Walter believe she's thinking of him; but
eighteen <i>can't</i> think of anything except itself. The poor
thing ought to know better than to trust her&mdash;she might
actually marry him! Such things have happened often enough."</p>

<p>Ah, that peach-bloom! Dangerous to any man of any age, if it
wished to be Claire knew. Peach-bloom! Alas&mdash;twenty-five!</p>

<p>The explorer was speaking to her. "There's another thing I'd
like to ask you if you can stand."</p>

<p>"Well then, ask me. I'll answer you."</p>

<p>"I'm asking because of my loneliness," he said seriously. "You
see, a civilized thinking man is naturally lonely among savages, no
matter how much he may find to interest him. Well, I discovered
long ago that he can be quite as lonely in civilized quarters of
the world, and I've just been making a re-discovery of that
uncomfortable fact. The truth is that I'm a peculiar man; I've
never been at all like anyone else I've ever known, and, naturally,
as queer a person as I can't expect many people to understand him,
nor can he hope to find many true companions. Yet that's what I've
yearned for all my life, understanding and companionship. I'm as
abrupt as I am frank, Miss Ambler; I always make up my mind about
people at my first glance and I've already told you I saw
understanding in your face. What I want to ask you is if you think
you could stand seeing something of me. Do you think you
could?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "We might mutually have some burdens to bear, if I
could, Mr. Peale."</p>

<p>"No," he said, leaning toward her earnestly. "I'm serious.
Perhaps I'd better tell you a little about myself." And with this
he began an autobiography that seemed to Claire to be one of
perfect candour yet strongly favourable to its subject. Half an
hour later, when musicians had begun to play in the next room, Mr.
Peale's memoirs had not reached his adult period. Nevertheless, in
spite of his naive self-absorption, Claire did not consider him a
fiasco; the narrative was vigorous and undeniably interesting;
moreover, she saw that she had no further need to exert herself.
All she had to do was to listen with a deeply understanding
expression and, if she did this often enough he would presently
wish her listening to be continuous. Before they parted, to-day, he
would ask her how soon he could see her again: she set his proposal
of marriage&mdash;if she chose&mdash;at about a month in the
future; less than that&mdash;if she chose. But she did not choose;
for already she knew the brown-faced man was not He. There was no
He; no true mate awaited her or ever would come out of space to
claim her&mdash;twenty-five was all that claimed her!</p>

<p>She jumped up to the first dancer who presented himself, and
departed from Mr. Peale with a word of apology so quickly spoken
that he had no opportunity to ask her when he might continue his
narrative. He meant to "cut in," and hovered in the offing, waiting
to do so; whereupon, finding herself swept near a door, she said
hurriedly, "That's all; I'm going home," slid from her partner's
arms and out into the hallway. But just as she effected this
evasion, Miss Kitty Peale dancing near her with Walter, was
claimed, and left him for another.</p>

<p>Kitty somewhat recklessly allowed it to become evident that she
was reluctant to make the exchange, and as she was borne onward her
eyes lingered upon her previous partner.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," she called sweetly. "Eight-thirty to-night."</p>

<p>And Claire, as she went toward the outer door of the apartment,
heard Walter's response, a single word: "<i>Forget?</i>"</p>

<p>The incredulity he expressed was sufficient.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" Claire said reminiscently, as she waited for the
elevator; and when she had reached her own apartment, and, after a
dexterous avoidance of her mother, was in her own room, she said
"Idiot!" again.</p>

<p>She looked at a little clock of lapus lazuli and gold upon a
table, and sat down before a mirror to remove her shoes: she must
undress, then dress for a dinner. "Dress, undress, dress, undress!"
she murmured wretchedly, half-aloud. "Undress, then dress again.
And what the devil is it all <i>about</i>?"</p>

<p>She had taken off one shoe; she held it in her hand and sat
staring at it, her head bent over it, until she noticed a tiny drop
of water upon the shining black surface of its long, curved
heel;&mdash;a tear had fallen there without her being aware of it
in her eye.</p>

<p>She hurled the pretty shoe across the room, so that it struck
noisily against the wall. "Oh, my gosh!" she whispered in sharp
despair. "Twenty-five! I can't stand it and it can't be stopped!
Nothing in the world can <i>stop</i> it! Twenty-<i>five</i>!"</p>

<p class="cpb">XXVI.</p>

<p>SHE had been twenty-five for a month and a week; it was bearable
as is everything that must be borne; but it was still incredible.
"My twenty-sixth year!" she said to herself. "That's the same as
the twenty-seventh&mdash;or twenty-eighth&mdash;" And she thought
of herself as "outside of life" now, forever. "I've chosen not to
live," she thought. "What's the difference between that and
suicide?"</p>

<p>Her mother had gone to a concert; Claire was alone in the
apartment and she stood at a window, from this high cliffside
looking forth upon tower and abyss illumined by the prodigious
night flares. The new skyline, staggering with the new
sky-scrapers, rose even above her, overwhelming the stars with the
blatant giantism of the new New York. She felt its huge provincial
commonness, its stupendous materialism and its frantic
magnificence; but in the main it seemed to her a Titanic honeycomb
of lighted cells, with open doors through which flitted hordes and
hordes of girls breathlessly hungry for the approval of men who sat
in the cells appraising stodgily, or, roused by some cunning
appeal, succumbing to it with repulsive flaccidity. Yet all these
were ephemera; sky-scrapers, hungry girls and the men they sought
already partook of the dust they would soon become. She had learned
how suddenly the quicksilver years run out, carrying youth and life
itself with them.</p>

<p>She turned from the window, took up a book and sat down with it
in an exquisite but comfortable Louis Sixteenth chair. "What on
earth <i>is</i> this stuff?" she inquired petulantly when her eye,
not her mind, had read a paragraph blindly the third time. Then she
left the book upon the chair, went to the "concert grand" piano,
and sang half of a song in her rich and moving voice; but she
stopped in the middle of a note; her hands dropped from the keys.
Frowning, she rose and began to pace the floor.</p>

<p>"I ought to have gone out," she said aloud. "I don't believe I
should be alone to-night. I feel as if I might be going to do
something crazy."</p>

<p>Then, upon the instant, she did the thing she feared she might
do. She went to the telephone and called Walter Rackbridge at a
club. He was there; his voice indicated surprise when she let him
know who spoke to him, and it was significant that she had to let
him know this. For the first time he failed to recognize her
voice.</p>

<p>"Are you busy just now?" she asked, with some sharpness.</p>

<p>"No, not for an hour or so. I have an appointment later.
Why?"</p>

<p>"I thought if you cared to come and see me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why of course, if you wish," he said politely. "I'll be there
immediately."</p>

<p>He was there within ten minutes, in fact, and when he came in,
still obviously surprised, he found her seated in the pretty chair
and apparently reading. She looked up languidly; then, as he sat
down, facing her, she murmured a word of thanks for his coming.
"Good of you to be so obliging, Walter."</p>

<p>"Not at all," he said cordially. "You wanted to see me about
something?"</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide with the full look she gave him then. "I'm
not sure," she said slowly, "that it's necessary to add 'about
something.'"</p>

<p>He was mystified; plainly so. "You wanted to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What about?" the simple creature inquired.</p>

<p>At that, she looked away and shook her head ruefully; but made
no reply.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" he began uncomfortably. "I suppose you&mdash;I
haven't seen you since&mdash;well, I suppose you wanted to talk to
me about something."</p>

<p>"Is it inconvenient for you to be here?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I have to turn up at a party after the
theatre."</p>

<p>"You 'have to'?" she asked. "You mean you promised to? You
mustn't let me keep you."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time," he assured her, and then, in silence,
waited for her to explain why she had summoned him. No explanation
appeared to be forthcoming; she sat looking before her at the
fireplace where above a nether ruddiness small blue flames wavered
upon the anthracite coal; but she did not speak, and appeared to
have settled definitely into this brooding contemplation. More and
more puzzled, he continued to wait, until it began to seem to him
that he was engaged in a form of endurance contest. If he was, he
failed to win it, for finally, after coughing slightly several
times, he said, "Oh&mdash;by the way&mdash;" then stopped.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said. "'By the way'&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I've been seeing quite a little of Sherman Peale lately and
I've wondered if you appreciate what an extraordinary person he
is."</p>

<p>"What?" she said lifelessly. "Oh, yes; I believe I do. Why?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't think so," Walter explained. "He's rather mystified
by your treatment of him, though I'm sure you haven't meant to be
rude."</p>

<p>"Rude?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't he written you twice asking when he could see you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Three times. Another note came to-day 'in case the others
had miscarried,' he mentioned."</p>

<p>"And you haven't answered any of them? I imagine he's a little
taken aback."</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked, still gazing absently at the fire. "How did
you find all this out? Did Mr. Peale tell you?"</p>

<p>"No. His daughter told me. She was secretly terribly amused, and
laughed about it. I'm afraid she doesn't take her father very
seriously?"</p>

<p>"No," Claire said. "What does she take seriously?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because there's only one thing she can."</p>

<p>"Only one thing she can take seriously? A person, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Claire said; and now, as she spoke, she turned her head
and looked at him with a clear and friendly regard. "I hear you've
been everywhere with her lately and by this time you probably feel
that you know her pretty well. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; of course."</p>

<p>Claire shook her head. "You don't. Nobody does. She doesn't,
herself. She last of all, indeed!"</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I know so," Claire said quietly. "She's eighteen. I know what I
was like at eighteen and it's what I've been more or less like ever
since, until I found twenty-five coming down on me. Of course I was
a little less like eighteen with every advancing year, yet
sometimes I feel that I've only lately quite got over being Miss
Kitty Peale. Well, you see, I know her, and she's not good enough
for you, Walter."</p>

<p>"Why, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. A girl of eighteen can't take you seriously; she
can't take anything seriously, except herself; she can't think of
anything except herself. It isn't her fault; she doesn't know how.
She can't be in love with anyone but herself; and that isn't her
fault, either; she merely doesn't know how. All she can actually
<i>see</i> is herself. She wants to have everybody in love with her
that she can possibly get into that condition; but she really
doesn't understand that her lovers are human beings, her
fellow-beings&mdash;not even when she singles one out and believes
that she adores him. It's only another way of adoring herself. I've
really given you more feeling, just as your friend, than Kitty
Peale is capable of giving you, even if she should let you marry
her. I'm giving you so much friendship at this very moment, Walter,
that I dare take the risk of asking you if you couldn't see her as
she is, for your own sake, and cease to be one of her squadron. Her
father told me she has a 'squadron' of boys about her. They'll
content her and they won't get much hurt, but you
might&mdash;especially if she should decide she wanted you to marry
her."</p>

<p>Walter stared, and his colour heightened visibly. "See here," he
said. "Do you mean you're advising me to stop seeing her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I take that risk."</p>

<p>"I think you might very well call it a risk!" he said
bitterly.</p>

<p>"I'll define it if you like," she rejoined, giving him a wan and
rather wavering smile. "I told you I would never take you myself
and I never shall. I know now that I'll never be
married&mdash;never&mdash;not ever at all, Walter. And since I
won't take you, myself, you want to know how it gets to be my
affair that you may wish to marry someone else. How dare I warn you
to keep away from another girl, against whom there's nothing in the
world to be said except that she's in the very perfection of the
peach-bloom age? Well, I do warn you, because I know what trouble I
made for a few boys and men when I had that age, myself, and I dare
the risk of what you'll think of me for my warning. You'll very
likely only think me a jealous dog in the manger." She rose
suddenly, went to the other end of the room and stood with her back
to him. "Well, if you care to think it, go ahead and think it!"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to think?" he asked, not moving from his
chair.</p>

<p>"Anything you like!"</p>

<p>His reddened brow was corrugated by a frown of reflection; he
shook his head ruefully, baffled, and then he was startled for she
turned and spoke sharply to him.</p>

<p>"That's all I have to say. I think you'd better go."</p>

<p>"Go?" he repeated, and his bewilderment was so great that he
could only inquire, feebly, "Go where?"</p>

<p>"Back to your club," she said angrily. "Or to keep your
engagement with Miss Peale. Or anywhere you like!"</p>

<p>He got up and came to her. "What is it you want me to do,
Claire? Do you mean that though you won't have me you're advising
me not to marry anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she cried. "Would that be so hard for a man?
Plenty of women bear it. Couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should," he said. "There's no reason in the
world why I shouldn't marry if I wish to. Why shouldn't I
now&mdash;if I wish to?"</p>

<p>"You poor goose!" she cried. "Because you'll only be marrying on
the rebound after I refused you! Because you'll only be falling for
peach-bloom that'll be gone forever in an hour or so! Because
you'll have been caught by a self-centred little monkey's knowing
how to say 'The first time I saw you I wondered who you were!' Wait
till you find a woman who can take some interest in you for
yourself and not in your merely being in love with her! Then marry
her, marry her as quickly as you can, in heaven's name!"</p>

<p>"But if I should never find her?"</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you bear it?" she said fiercely. "<i>I</i> bear
it! Couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Never marrying?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know how much easier that is for a man? Don't you
understand&mdash;don't you see&mdash;" Then, without warning and
almost to his horror, for he had never seen her weep, she dropped
down upon a sofa and burst into tears. "Don't you know," she
sobbed, "don't you know that for a woman it's the same as
suicide?"</p>

<p>He sat beside her and took her hand; but she jerked it away.
"Let me alone!" she cried. "I told you to go! I want to be left by
myself."</p>

<p>In high distress he rubbed his forehead. "Look here," he said.
"This is terrible; I've never seen you like this and never dreamed
you could be. What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I tell you, if you'll just go!"</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> something the matter," he insisted
thoughtfully. "Your nerves are probably to blame and you oughtn't
to let them get unstrung like this. You ought to&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, crying out, she interrupted him. "Ah! Will you please go
back to your club before you tell me to see a nerve
specialist?"</p>

<p>"All right; if you want to be let alone, I'll go." And with
that, he rose and went decisively toward the door; but paused
before he reached it. "You knew that when one girl asks a man not
to let himself be carried away by another girl he's likely to think
her merely jealous, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, glory!" Claire groaned. "I told you I took that risk
knowingly."</p>

<p>"It's a long time&mdash;a long, long time"&mdash;he said, and
his voice had become a little tremulous;&mdash;"It's a long, long
time since you cared to have me in love with you. But you take
enough interest in me now for myself to risk anything I might think
of you."</p>

<p>"What?" she said in a low voice; then she lifted her head from
between her two hands where it had been drooping; and with wet,
wide eyes, she stared at him. "What?" she repeated more loudly; and
a third time she said the word, louder still. "<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>He came and stood before her. "You care enough for me on my own
account to take that risk. How much more do you expect to care for
anybody?"</p>

<p>Startled, disturbed to the depths of her being, wretched, yet
vaguely illumined by what at first seemed a mirage of happiness,
she rose and moved as though to put a greater distance between
them; but after one step away, she halted&mdash;she put a gentle
and trembling hand softly upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said uncertainly. "I don't think I ever
could know. Do you think it's enough, dear?"</p>

<p class="cpb">XXVII.</p>

<p>AT ABOUT twelve o'clock on the night before her wedding, Claire
came into her room, and, after locking the door, went to a chest
and took from it a large oblong case of stamped brown leather. She
set it upon a chair beside the chest; then, after a moment of
frowning, sank down upon the floor beside the chair and opened the
leathern case. It contained various objects, now worthless, and she
took them out, one by one, and dropped them into a waste-basket
that stood beside the chest.</p>

<p>There were some packets of letters, tied with narrow ribbons;
there were a few withered flowers, singly and in little clumps, and
there were ribbons that had been tied about bouquets of orchids, of
roses, of violets; there were college pins, scarf pins, a green
silk handkerchief, a club hat-band, and sheafs of photographs. Most
of the photographs were of the heads of young gentlemen; but some
were of groups of boys and girls together; and in most of these a
younger Claire appeared. There were "snapshots" of her with girls
and boys in sail-boats, in motorboats, or on beaches or rocks by
the sea; and in a number of them she was seen with the same boy
always beside her. Later pictures showed another boy occupying this
favoured place; and in others other boys were seen there. Then
there were little photographs taken abroad; and in several of these
a young Italian cavalry officer was a romantic figure. Claire
solemnly threw him into the waste-basket along with the rest.</p>

<p>At last the leathern chest was cleared of everything except a
single photograph and a foreign envelope of thin bluish paper. She
brought forth the photograph and looked at it long and intently; it
was not a portrait; it was a landscape, singular and
beautiful&mdash;a long ledge of cliff whereon were gardens and
walled villas and Greek ruins and an old Mediterranean town, with a
snow-capped volcano rising beyond and the sea washing the foot of
the cliff. This photograph did not share the fate of the others;
she replaced it gently in the case, and then, with fingers that
moved slowly and gently, as in some reverent ceremony, she brought
forth the bluish envelope and took from it two sheets of paper. One
of these was thin and bluish, like the envelope; it was the
conclusion of a letter the previous pages of which had been lost,
or destroyed; and the other sheet showed a writing in faded ink by
a different hand.</p>

<p>Claire read the fragment of the letter first; she had read it
often and often before. Part of the sentence at the top of the page
was missing, having been written upon one of the lost sheets; and
what she read began abruptly:</p>

<p>"Therefore I thought you might care to have the verses. His
sister is anxious that I should send them to you and she speaks
often and warmly of her gratitude to you. Please never doubt that
you did the kindest and best thing; it is she who asks me to tell
you that. I have made a copy of the verses for her, and the
enclosure is the original, just as she found it among his effects.
He had a fancy for writing in Elizabethan forms sometimes, though
he laughed at his use of them, himself, and said he had no doubt he
used them incorrectly. I thought them charming, and it seemed to me
he had a distinct gift that way. He had not shown these that I send
you to anyone&mdash;not even to his sister&mdash;nor had he spoken
of them at all; but we both perceived that the reference was to
you. My surmise is that they were written here at Raona, probably
soon after your departure&mdash;or, even, perhaps, a little
before&mdash;and I hope that they and my sorrowful news may not
make your remembrance of our beautiful old cliff too sad a one for
you to return to us some day. For my own part, my heart is heavy
just now, dear Miss Ambler, and I fear yours will be. We shall not
look upon his like again&mdash;yet Raona stands here forever and
waits your sight of it once more."</p>

<p>She put the writing back into the bluish envelope as gently and
slowly as she had brought it forth; then she took up the other
sheet and read the verses, as she had read them so many, many times
before.</p>

<p class="poem">"O, Ladye, scorn mee!<br>
Ladye, let mee be<br>
Contente wyth lyfe or death,<br>
Soe I may goe forth wyllinglye<br>
When that the thread He sonderethe.<br>
<br>
"O, Ladye scorn mee,<br>
Gayze on mee mockynglye,<br>
Be kynde and passe mee bye!<br>
Suffere mee not to love thee, Ladye,<br>
Lest I so hayte to die!"</p>

<p>She read slowly, her head bent far over the faded writing, and
that fair and charming head of hers was bowed low indeed when she
had finished. Her hands, rising to meet it, held the sheet of paper
in them so that the writing came against her cheek. "Ah,
good-bye&mdash;good-bye&mdash;good-bye!" she whispered
brokenly.</p>

<p>She would never read either the letter or the quaint little poem
again; or take them again from the leathern case where she replaced
them; but she would always know they were there, and so, finally,
in spite of that dutiful farewell whisper of hers, it was not quite
good-bye.</p>

<p class="cpb">XXVIII.</p>

<p>THE church was not a large one, and the decorously expectant
wedding-guests filled it comfortably. A soprano voice had sung
nobly from a gallery, long white ribbons had been drawn, and now
the organ palpitated profoundly into every ear a majestic vamping.
Through a door just opened at the left of the altar, the clergyman
in his gown could be seen, and, behind him, the bridegroom and his
supporting comrade, composing themselves for the imminent
confrontation and erasing from their countenances every token of
either emotion or intelligence. All that they allowed to remain
visible was accurate tailoring accompanied by the pallor of
stage-fright.</p>

<p>The organ developed the heralding signal of the great nuptial
approach; the air of the interior trembled to those bars of music
so familiar that they seem to invest their composer, not in his
chosen solemn mantle, but in the mocking garb of a comedian. To
these helplessly satirical measures, the clergyman slowly advanced,
followed obscurely by the two sartorial vacancies, while from the
rear, dressed as twins, eight embarrassingly self-conscious
gentlemen were seen to be approaching rhythmically. After them,
eight lovely young women, all in heliotrope and as rhythmic and
self-conscious as the eight gentlemen twins, though more becomingly
so, passed through stained shafts of light from a pointed window,
seeming to float dazzlingly in many colours for a moment before
they turned to heliotrope again and paced slowly to their appointed
stations.</p>

<p>Then the bride came down the aisle, alone. She walked with her
head a little advanced but her face uplifted; and about her grave
and tender eyes, and upon her lips, there appeared the faintest
foreshadowings of an ineffable smile. Through the fine lace of her
veil, there were glints of her fair hair like gold seen in a mist:
never had she been so graceful; never had she looked so lovely. And
when she passed through the coloured light of the great window, and
her bridal white became a drifting rosiness in aureoles of amber
and softest blue, a breathed "<i>Ah!</i>" of pleasure was
multitudinous upon the air. For she seemed then just such a
glimpsed vision of angelic beauty, wistful yet serene, as a devout
eye attuned to miracles should have beheld in that place.</p>

<p>She suspected this, herself, for she had seen the bridesmaids
passing through that light before her. "I hope it's doing as well
by me," she thought. "With this beautiful cream-white it ought to
do even a lot better. Thank heaven everything's all right so far! I
sha'n't begin to let my smile be more definite just yet&mdash;not
till I reach the third pew from the end&mdash;and I mustn't forget
to turn my head to the right and let a gentle little corner of the
smile go to poor Mother after I've given Walter that look. He's
there, waiting, of course; I'll be able to see him in a moment,
poor thing! I'm getting married to him and this is my
wedding&mdash;my <i>wedding</i>! It doesn't seem to be that. Why
don't I realize it? How on earth does it happen? How does it come
to be my wedding&mdash;if it really <i>is</i>! Am I in love with
him? Is it because of that? Was it the contagion, after all?
<i>Am</i> I getting married because 'all the rest' were getting
married? What <i>is</i> my reason for it? Have I just been
<i>crazy</i>? Good heavens, <i>is</i> it happening <i>now</i>?" And
that "double" sense of hers was never more strongly with her than
then, as she came down the aisle to be wedded. As audience, she saw
herself distractedly asking these belated questions and at the same
time stage-directing her every movement and expression. But at the
third pew from the front, where she intended to look up and seem to
become happily conscious of Walter, then to smile exquisitely upon
him, there was a moment when the audience within her, and the
stage-director, and the actress as well, disappeared.</p>

<p>Walter should have advanced a step to meet her and take her
hand; but he did not move. He stood stock-still; and, though he
appeared to be looking at her, she saw that he was but dimly aware
of her. His eyes were glassy and he trembled from head to foot; she
perceived that he was almost helpless, dazed with stage-fright. And
at that, a quick emotion rose within her: she was filled with pity,
with tenderness and with amusement.</p>

<p>She put out her hand to him, and as he took it gingerly, she
grasped his unnerved fingers strongly, and from her bright eyes
gave him, not the look she had intended and rehearsed, but one more
truly eloquent, wholly impulsive and impromptu.</p>

<p>"You dear goose!" it said so clearly that he understood it
completely. "What's the matter with you? I'm here to see you
through this, don't you understand? I'll see you through it all
right, and I'll see you through,
everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;all right. That's what I'm
here for. Don't you <i>see</i>?"</p>

<p>He did see: colour came into his stricken cheeks; something of
his usual manliness returned to him, and, as he moved forward with
her to the altar, his eyes became human again in the look of
passionate gratitude he gave her.</p>

<p>She was uplifted with the happiness of a great reassurance; once
more she knew that she had forgotten herself and remembered
him.</p>
