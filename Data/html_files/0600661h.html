<h3>BOOK TWENTY-TWO IN THE TARZAN SERIES</h3>

<h3>This e-book edition: Project Gutenberg Australia, 2015</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

<p class="note">The e-book contains the following Tarzan
stories:</p>

<p class="note" style="margin-left:10%">&bull; "Tarzan and the
Champion" (from <i>Blue Book</i> magazine, April 1940);<br>
&bull; "Tarzan and the Jungle Murders" (from <i>Thrilling
Adventures</i>, June 1940);<br>
&bull; "The Quest of Tarzan" (from <i>Argosy Weekly</i>, August
23-September 6, 1941)</p>

<p class="note">These stories were collected and published in book
form by Canaveral Press in 1965. At that time, the third
story&mdash;"The Quest of Tarzan"&mdash;was renamed "Tarzan and the
Castaways" to avoid confusion with the earlier novel "Tarzan's
Quest," which was serialised in <i>The Blue Book Magazine</i> from
October 1935 to March 1936, and published as a book by Edgar Rice
Burroughs, Inc., in September 1936.&mdash;RG.</p>

<p class="first">
"SIX&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten!" The referee
stepped to a neutral corner and hoisted Mullargan's right hand.
"The win-nah and new champion!" he shouted.</p>

<p>For a moment the audience, which only partially filled Madison
Square Garden, sat in stunned and stupefied silence; then there was
a burst of applause, intermingled with which was an almost equal
volume of boos. It wasn't that the booers questioned the
correctness of the decision&mdash;they just didn't like Mullargan,
a notoriously dirty fighter. Doubtless, too, many of them had had
their dough on the champion.</p>

<p>Joey Marks, Mullargan's manager, and the other man who had been
in his corner crawled through the ropes and slapped Mullargan on
the back; photographers, sportswriters, police, and a part of the
audience converged on the ring; jittery news-commentators bawled
the epochal tidings to a waiting world.</p>

<p>The former champion, revived but a bit wobbly, crossed the ring
and proffered a congratulatory hand to Mullargan. The new champion
did not take the hand. "G'wan, you bum," he said, and turned his
back.</p>

<p>"One-Punch" Mullargan had come a long way in a little more than
a year&mdash;from amateur to preliminary fighter, to Heavyweight
Champion of the World; and he had earned his sobriquet. He had, in
truth, but one punch; and he needed but that one&mdash;a lethal
right to the button. Sometimes he had had to wait several rounds
before he found an opening, but eventually he had always found it.
The former champion, a ten-to-one favorite at ringside, had gone
down in the third round. Since then, One-Punch Mullargan had fought
but nine rounds; yet he had successfully defended his championship
six times, leaving three men with broken jaws and one with a
fractured skull. After all, who wishes his skull fractured?</p>

<p>So One-Punch Mullargan decided to take a vacation and do
something he always had wanted to do but which fate had always
heretofore intervened to prevent. Several years before, he had seen
a poster which read, "Join the navy and see the world;" he had
always remembered that poster; and now, with a vacation on his
hands, Mullargan decided to go and see the world for himself,
without any assistance from Navy or Marines.</p>

<p>"I ain't never seen Niag'ra Falls," said his manager. "That
would be a nice place to go for a vacation. If we was to go there,
that would give Niag'ra Falls a lot of publicity too."</p>

<p>"Niag'ra Falls, my foot!" said Mullargan. "We're goin' to
Africa."</p>

<p>"Africa," mused Mr. Marks. "That's a hell of a long ways
off&mdash;down in South America somewheres. Wot you wanna go there
for?"</p>

<p>"Huntin'. You see them heads in that guy's house what we were at
after the fight the other night, didn't you? Lions, buffaloes,
elephants. Gee! That must be some sport."</p>

<p>"We ain't lost no lions, kid," said Marks. There was a note of
pleading in his voice. "Listen, kid: stick around here for a couple
more fights; then you'll have enough potatoes to retire on, and you
can go to Africa or any place you want to&mdash;but not me."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to Africa, and you're goin' with me. If you want to
get some publicity out of it, you better call up them newspaper
bums."</p>

<p>Sports-writers and camera-men milled about the champion on the
deck of the ship ten days later. Bulbs flashed; shutters clicked;
reporters shot questions; passengers crowded closer with craning
necks; a girl elbowed her way through the throng with an autograph
album.</p>

<p>"When did he learn to write?" demanded a <i>Daily News</i>
man.</p>

<p>"Wise guy," growled Mullargan.</p>

<p>"Give my love to Tarzan when you get to Africa," said
another.</p>

<p>"And don't get fresh with him, or he'll take you apart,"
interjected the <i>Daily News</i> man.</p>

<p>"I seen that bum in pitchers," said Mullargan. "He couldn't take
nobody apart."</p>

<p>"I'll lay you ten to one he could K.O. you in the first round,"
taunted the <i>Daily News</i> man.</p>

<p>"You ain't got ten, you bum," retorted the champion.</p>

<p><br>
A heavily laden truck lumbered along the edge of a vast plain under
the guns of the forest which had halted here, sending out a
scattering of pickets to reconnoiter the terrain held by the enemy.
Why the tree army never advanced, why the plain always held its
own&mdash;these are mysteries.</p>

<p>And the lorry was a mystery to the man far out on the plain, who
watched its slow advance. He knew that there were no tracks there,
that perhaps since creation this was the first wheeled vehicle that
had ever passed this way.</p>

<p>A white man in a disreputable sun-helmet drove the truck; beside
him sat a black man; sprawled on top of the load were several other
blacks. The lengthening shadow of the forest stretched far beyond
the crawling anachronism, marking the approach of the brief
equatorial twilight.</p>

<p>The man out upon the plain set his course so that he might meet
the truck. He moved with an easy, sinuous stride that was almost
catlike in its smoothness. He wore no clothes other than a
loin-cloth; his weapons were primitive: a quiver of arrows and a
bow at his back, a hunting-knife in a rude scabbard at his hip, a
short, stout spear that he carried in his hand. Looped across one
shoulder and beneath the opposite arm was a coil of grass rope. The
man was very dark, but he was not a Negro. A lifetime beneath the
African sun accounted for his bronzed skin.</p>

<p>Upon his shoulder squatted a little monkey, one arm around the
bronzed neck. "Tarmangani, Nkima," said the man, looking in the
direction of the truck.</p>

<p>"Tarmangani," chattered the monkey. "Nkima and Tarzan will kill
the tarmangani." He stood up and blew out his cheeks and looked
very ferocious. At a great distance from an enemy, or when upon the
shoulder of his master, little Nkima was a lion at heart. His
courage was in inverse ratio to the distance that separated him
from Tarzan, and in direct ratio to that which lay between himself
and danger. If little Nkima had been a man, he would probably have
been a gangster and certainly a bully; but he still would have been
a coward. Being just a little monkey, he was only amusing. He did,
however, possess one characteristic which, upon occasion, elevated
him almost to heights of sublimity. That was his self-sacrificing
loyalty to his master, Tarzan.</p>

<p>At last the man on the truck saw the man on foot, saw that they
were going to meet a little farther on. He shifted his pistol to a
more accessible position and loosened it in its holster. He glanced
at the rifle that the boy beside him was holding between his knees,
and saw that it was within easy reach. He had never been in this
locality before, and did not know the temper of the natives. It was
well to take precautions. As the distance between them lessened, he
sought to identify the stranger.</p>

<p><i>"Mtu mweusi?"</i> he inquired of the boy beside him, who was
also watching the approaching stranger.</p>

<p><i>"Mzungu, bwana,"</i> replied the boy.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," agreed the man. "I guess he's a white
man, all right, but he's sure dressed up like a native."</p>

<p><i>"Menyi wazimo,"</i> laughed the boy.</p>

<p>"I got two crazy men on my hands now," said the man. "I don't
want another." He brought the truck to a stop as Tarzan
approached.</p>

<p>Little Nkima was chattering and scolding fiercely, baring his
teeth in what he undoubtedly thought was a terrifying snarl. Nobody
paid any attention to him, but he held his ground until Tarzan was
within fifty feet of the truck; then he leaped to the ground and
sought the safety of a tree near by. After all, what was the use of
tempting fate?</p>

<p>Tarzan stopped beside the truck and looked up into the white
man's face. "What are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>Melton, looking down upon an almost naked man, felt his own
superiority; and resented the impertinence of the query.
Incidentally, he had noted that the stranger carried no
firearms.</p>

<p>"I'm drivin' a lorry, buddy," he said.</p>

<p>"Answer my question." This time Tarzan's tone had an edge to
it.</p>

<p>Melton had had a hard day. As a matter of fact, he had had a
number of hard days. He was worried, and his nerves were on edge.
His hand moved to the butt of his pistol as he formulated a caustic
rejoinder, but he never voiced it. Tarzan's arm shot out; his hand
seized Melton's wrist and dragged the man from the cab of the
truck. An instant later he was disarmed.</p>

<p>Nkima danced up and down upon the branch of his tree and hurled
jungle billingsgate at the enemy, intermittently screaming at
Tarzan to kill the tarmangani. No one paid any attention to him.
That was a cross that Nkima always had to bear. He was so little
and insignificant that no one ever paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>The blacks on the truck sat in wide-eyed confusion. The thing
had happened so suddenly that it had caught their wits off guard.
They saw the stranger dragging Melton away from the truck, shaking
him as a dog shakes a rat. Tarzan had learned from experience that
there is no surer way of reducing a man to subservience than by
shaking him. Perhaps he knew nothing of the psychology of the
truth, but he knew the truth.</p>

<p>The latter was a powerful man, but he was helpless in the grip
of the stranger; and he was frightened, too. There was something
more terrifying about this creature than his superhuman strength.
There was the quite definite sensation of being in the clutches of
a wild beast, so that his reactions were much the same as they had
been many years before when he had been mauled by a
lion&mdash;something of a fatalistic resignation to the
inevitable.</p>

<p>Tarzan stopped shaking Melton and turned his eyes on the boy
with the rifle, who had jumped down from the truck. "Throw down the
rifle," he said in Swahili.</p>

<p>The boy hesitated. "Throw it down," ordered Melton; and then, to
Tarzan: "What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"I asked you what you were doing here. I want an answer."</p>

<p>"I'm guidin' a couple of bloomin' Yanks."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>Melton shrugged. "Gawd only knows. They started out early this
morning in a light car, and told me to keep along the edge of the
forest. Said they'd come back an' meet me later in the day. They're
probably lost. They're both balmy."</p>

<p>"What are they doing here?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Hunting."</p>

<p>"Why did you bring them here? This is closed territory."</p>

<p>"I didn't bring 'em here; they brought me. You can't tell
Mullargan nothing. He's one of those birds that knows it all. He
don't need a guide; what he needs is a keeper. He's Heavyweight
Champion of the World, and it's gone to his head. Try to tell him
anything, and he's just as likely as not to slap you down. He's
knocked the boys around something awful. I never saw such a rotten
bounder in my life. The other one ain't so bad. He's Mullargan's
manager. That's a laugh. Manager, my eye! All he says is, 'Yes,
kid!' 'Okay, kid!' and all he wants to do is get back to New York.
He's scared to death all the time. I wish to hell they was both
back in New York. I wish I was rid of 'em."</p>

<p>"Are they out alone?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you may be rid of them. This is lion country. I have never
seen them so bad."</p>

<p>Melton whistled. "Then I got to push on and try to find 'em. I
don't like 'em, but I'm responsible for 'em. You"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"you ain't goin' to try to stop me, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan. "Go and find them, and tell them to get out
of this country and stay out." Then he started on toward the
forest.</p>

<p>When he had gone a short distance, Melton called to him. "Who
are you, anyway?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The ape-man paused and turned around. "I am Tarzan," he
said.</p>

<p>Again Melton whistled. He climbed back into the cab of the truck
and started the motor; and as the heavy vehicle got slowly under
way, Tarzan disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p>The sun swung low into the west, and the lengthening shadow of
the forest stretched far out into the plain. A light car bounced
and jumped over the uneven ground. There were two men in the car.
One of them drove, and the other braced himself and held on. His
eyes were red-rimmed; he sneezed almost continuously.</p>

<p>"Fer cripe's sake, kid, can't you slow down?" wailed Marks.
"ain't this hay-fever bad enough without you tryin' to jounce the
liver out of me?"</p>

<p>For answer Mullargan pressed the accelerator down a little
farther.</p>

<p>"You won't have no springs or no tires or no manager, if you
don't slow down."</p>

<p>"I don't need no manager no more." That struck Mullargan as
being so funny that he repeated it. "I don't need no manager no
more; so I bounces him out in Africa. Gee, wouldn't dat give the
guys a laugh!"</p>

<p>"Don't get no foolish ideas in your head, kid. You need a smart
fella like me, all right. All you got is below them big cauliflower
ears of yours."</p>

<p>"Is zat so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, zat's so."</p>

<p>Mullargan slowed down a little, for it had suddenly grown dark.
He switched on the lights. "It sure gets dark in a hurry here," he
commented. "I wonder why."</p>

<p>"It's the altitude, you dope," explained Marks.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence for a while. Marks glanced nervously to
right and left, for with the coming of night, the entire aspect of
the scene had changed as though they had been suddenly tossed into
a strange world. The plain was dimly lined in the ghostly light of
pale stars; the forest was solid, impenetrable blackness.</p>

<p>"Forty-second Street would look pretty swell right now,"
observed Marks.</p>

<p>"So would some grub," said Mullargan; "my belly's wrapped around
my backbone. I wonder what became of that so-an'-so. I told him to
keep right on till he met us. Them English is too damn'
cocky&mdash;think they know it all, tellin' me not to do this an'
not to do that. I guess the Champeen of the World can take care of
himself, all right."</p>

<p>"You said it, kid."</p>

<p>The silence of the plain was broken by the grunting of a hunting
lion. It was still some distance away, but the sound came plainly
to the ears of the two men.</p>

<p>"What was that?" queried Mullargan.</p>

<p>"A pig," said Marks.</p>

<p>"If it was daylight, we might get a shot at it," observed
Mullargan. "A bunch of pork chops wouldn't go so bad right now. You
know, Joey, I been thinkin' me and you could get along all right
without that English so-an'-so."</p>

<p>"Who'd drive the truck?"</p>

<p>"That's so," admitted Mullargan; "but he's got to stop treatin'
us like we was a couple o' kids and he was our nurse-girl. Pretty
soon I'm goin' to get sore and hand him one."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Marks. "There's a light&mdash;it must be the
truck."</p>

<p>When the two cars met, the tired men dropped to the ground and
stretched stiffened limbs and cramped muscles.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" demanded Mullargan.</p>

<p>"Coming right along ever since we broke camp," replied Melton.
"You know this bus can't cover the ground like that light car of
yours, and you must have covered a lot of it today. Any luck?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't believe there's any game around here."</p>

<p>"There's plenty. If you'll make a permanent camp somewhere, as
I've been telling you, we'll get something."</p>

<p>"We seen some buffaloes today," said Marks, "but they got
away."</p>

<p>"They went into some woods," explained Mullargan. "I followed
'em in on foot, but they got away."</p>

<p>"Lucky for you they did," observed Melton.</p>

<p>"What you mean&mdash;lucky for me?"</p>

<p>"If you'd shot one of 'em, you'd probably have been killed. I'd
rather face a lion any day than a wounded buffalo."</p>

<p>"Maybe you would," said Mullargan, "but I ain't afraid of no
cow."</p>

<p>Melton shrugged, turned and set the boys to making camp. "We've
got to camp where we are," he said to the other two whites. "We
couldn't find water now; and we've got enough anyway, such as it
is. Anyway, tomorrow we must turn back."</p>

<p>"Turn back?" exclaimed Mullargan. "Who says we gotta turn back?
I come here to hunt, an' I'm goin' to hunt."</p>

<p>"I met a man back there a way who says this is closed territory.
He told me we'd have to get out."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he? Who the hell does he think he is, tellin'
me to get out? Did you tell him who I was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he didn't seem to be much impressed."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll impress him if I see him. Who was he?"</p>

<p>"His name is Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Dat bum? Does he think he can run me out of Africa?"</p>

<p>"If he tells you to leave this part of Africa, you'd better,"
Melton advised.</p>

<p>"I'll leave when I get good an' damn' ready," said
Mullargan.</p>

<p>"I'm ready to go right now," said Marks, between sneezes. "This
here Africa ain't no place for a guy with hay-fever."</p>

<p>The boys were unloading the truck, hurrying to make camp. One
was building a fire preparatory to cooking supper. There was much
laughter, and now and then a snatch of native song. One of the
boys, carrying a heavy load from the truck, accidentally bumped
into Mullargan and threw him off balance. The fighter swung a
vicious blow at the black with his open palm, striking him across
the side of his head and knocking him to the ground.</p>

<p>"You'll look where you're goin' next time," he growled.</p>

<p>Melton came up to him. "That'll be all of that," he said. "I've
stood it as long as I'm goin' to. Don't ever hit another of these
boys."</p>

<p>"So you're lookin' for it too, are you?" shouted Mullargan. "All
right, you're goin' to get it."</p>

<p>Before he could strike, Melton drew his pistol and covered him.
"Come on," he invited. "I'm just waitin' for the chance to plead
guilty to killin' you in self-defense."</p>

<p>Mullargan stood staring at the gun for several seconds; then he
turned away. Later he confided to Marks: "Them English ain't got no
sense of humor. He might of seen I was just kiddin'."</p>

<p>The evening meal was a subdued affair. Conversation could not
accurately have been said to lag, since it did not even exist until
the meal was nearly over; then the grunting of a lion was heard
close to the camp.</p>

<p>"There's that pig again," said Mullargan. "Maybe we can get him
now."</p>

<p>"What pig?" asked Melton.</p>

<p>"You must be deaf," said Mullargan. "Can't you hear him?"</p>

<p>"Cripes!" exclaimed Marks. "Look at his eyes shine out
there."</p>

<p>Melton rose and stepping to the side of the truck switched on
the spotlight and swung it around upon the eyes. In the circle of
bright light stood a full-grown lion. Just for a moment he stood
there; then he turned and slunk off into the darkness.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Pig!" said Mullargan, disgustedly.</p>

<p>A chocolate-colored people are the Babangos, with good features
and well-shaped heads. Their teeth are not filed; yet they are
inveterate man-eaters. There are no religious implications in their
cannibalism, no superstitions. They eat human flesh because they
like it, because they prefer it to any other food; and like true
gourmets, they know how to prepare it. They hunt man as other men
hunt game animals, and they are hated and feared throughout the
territory that they raid.</p>

<p>Recently, word had been brought to Tarzan that the Babangos had
invaded a remote portion of that vast domain which, from boyhood,
he had considered his own; and Tarzan had come, making many
marches, to investigate. Behind him, moving more slowly, came a
band of his own white-plumed Waziri warriors, led by Muviro, their
famous chief...</p>

<p>It was the morning following Tarzan's encounter with Melton. The
ape-man was swinging along just inside the forest at the edge of
the plain, his every sense alert. There was no slightest suggestion
of caution in his free stride and confident demeanor; yet he moved
as silently as a shadow. He saw the puff adder in the grass and the
python waiting in the tree to seize its prey from above, and he
avoided them. He made a little detour, lest he pass beneath a
trumpet tree from which black ants might drop upon and sting
him.</p>

<p>Presently he halted and turned, looking back along the edge of
the forest and the plain. Neither you nor I could have heard what
he heard, because our lives have not depended to a great extent
upon the keenness of our hearing. There are wild beasts which have
notoriously poor eyesight, but none with poor hearing or a
deficient sense of smell. Tarzan, being a man and therefore poorly
equipped by nature to survive in his savage world, had developed
all his senses to an extraordinary degree; and so it was that now
he heard pounding hoofs in the far distance long before you or I
could have. And he heard another sound&mdash;a sound as strange to
that locale as would be the after-kill roar of a lion on Park
Avenue: the exhaust of a motor.</p>

<p>They were coming closer now; and they were coming fast. And now
there came another sound, drowning out the first&mdash;the staccato
of a machine-gun. Presently they tore past him&mdash;a herd of
zebra; and clinging to their flank was a light car. One man drove,
and the other pumped lead from a submachine gun into the fleeing
herd. Zebra fell, some killed, some only maimed; but the car sped
on, its occupants ignoring the suffering beasts in its wake.</p>

<p>Tarzan, helpless to prevent it, viewed the slaughter in cold
anger. He had witnessed the brutality of game-hogs before, but
never anything like this. His estimate of man, never any too high,
reached nadir. He went out into the plain and mercifully put out of
their misery those of the animals which were hopelessly wounded,
following the trail of destruction in the direction that the car
had taken. Eventually he would come upon the two men again, and
there would be an accounting.</p>

<p>Far ahead of him, the survivors of the terrified herd plunged
into a rock gully, and clambering up the opposite side, disappeared
over the ridge as Mullargan brought the car to a stop near the
bottom.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he exclaimed. "Was dat sport! When I gets all my heads up
on a wall, I'll make that Park Avenue guy look like a piker."</p>

<p>"You sure cleaned 'em up, kid," said Marks. "That was some
shootin'."</p>

<p>"I wasn't a expert rifleman in the Marine Corps for nothin',
Joey. Now if I could just run into a flock of lions&mdash;boy!"</p>

<p>The forest came down into the head of the gorge, and the trees
grew thickly to within a hundred yards of the car. There was a
movement among the trees there, but neither of the dull-witted men
were conscious of it. They had lighted cigars and were enjoying a
few moments of relaxation.</p>

<p>"I guess we better start back an' mop up," said Mullargan. "I
don't want to lose none of 'em. Say, at this rate I ought to take
back about a thousand heads if we put in a full month. I'll sure
give them newspaper bums somep'n to write about when I get home.
I'll have one of them photographer bums take my pitcher settin' on
top of a thousand heads&mdash;all kinds. That'll get in every
newspaper in the U.S."</p>

<p>"It sure will, kid," agreed Marks. "We'll sure give Africa a lot
of publicity." As he spoke, his eyes were on the forest up the
gorge. Suddenly his brows knitted. "Say, kid, lookit! What's
that?"</p>

<p>Mullargan looked, and then cautiously picked up the machine-gun.
"S-s-sh!" he cautioned. "That's a elephant. What luck!" He raised
the muzzle of the weapon and squeezed the trigger. An elephant
trumpeted and lurched out into the open. It was followed by another
and another, until seven of the great beasts were coming toward
them; then the gun jammed.</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Mullargan. "They'll get away before I can
clear this."</p>

<p>"They ain't goin' away," said Marks. "They're comin' for
us."</p>

<p>The elephants, poor of eyesight, finally located the car. Their
trunks and their great ears went up, as, trumpeting, they charged;
but by that time Mullargan had cleared the gun and was pouring lead
into them again. One elephant went down. Others wavered and turned
aside. It was too much for them&mdash;too much for all but one, a
great bull, which, maddened by the pain of many wounds, carried the
charge home.</p>

<p>The sound of the machine-gun ceased. Mullargan threw the weapon
down in disgust. "Beat it, Joey!" he yelled; "the drum's
empty."</p>

<p>The two men tumbled over the opposite side of the car as the
bull struck it. The weight of the great body, the terrific impact,
rolled the car over, wheels up. The bull staggered and lurched
forward, falling across the chassis, dead.</p>

<p>The two men came slowly back. "Gee!" said Mullargan. "Look wot
he went an' done to that jalopy! Henry wouldn't never recognize it
now." He got down on his hands and knees and tried to peer
underneath the wreck.</p>

<p>Marks was shaking like an aspen. "Suppose he hadn't of croaked,"
he said; "where would we of been? Wot we goin' to do now?"</p>

<p>"We gotta wait here until the truck comes. Our guns is all
underneath that mess. Maybe the truck can drag the big bum off. We
gotta have our guns."</p>

<p>"I wish to Gawd I was back on Broadway," said Marks, sneezing,
"where there ain't no elephants or no hay."</p>

<hr>

<p>Little Nkima was greatly annoyed. In the first place, the blast
of the machine-gun had upset him. It had frightened him so badly
that he had abandoned the sanctuary of his lord and master's
shoulder and scampered to the uttermost pinnacle of a near-by tree.
When Tarzan had gone out on the plain, he had followed; and he
didn't like it at all out on the plain, because the fierce African
sun beat down, and there was no protection. And he was further
annoyed because he had continued to hear the nerve-shattering sound
intermittently for quite some time, and it came from the direction
in which they were going. As he scampered along behind, he scolded
his master; for little Nkima saw no sense in looking for trouble in
a world in which there was already more than enough looking for
you.</p>

<p>Tarzan had heard the sound of the gunning, the squeals of hurt
elephants and the trumpeting of angry elephants; and he visualized
the brutal tragedy as clearly as though he saw it with his eyes;
and his anger rose so that he forgot the law of the white man, for
Tantor the elephant was his best friend. It was a wild beast, a
killer, that set out at a brisk trot in the direction from which
the sounds had come.</p>

<p>The sounds that had come to the ears of Tarzan and the ears of
Nkima had come also to other ears in the dense forest beyond the
gorge. Their owners were slinking through the shaded gloom on
silent, stealthy feet to reconnoiter. They came warily, for they
knew the sounds meant white men; and many white men with guns were
bad medicine. They hoped that there were not too many.</p>

<p>As Tarzan reached the edge of the gorge and looked down upon the
scene below, other eyes looked down from the opposite side.</p>

<p>These other eyes saw Tarzan; but the trees and the underbrush
hid them from him, and the wind being at his back, their scent was
not carried to his nostrils.</p>

<p>Of the two men in the gorge, Marks was the first to see Tarzan.
He called Mullargan's attention to him, and the two men watched the
ape-man descending slowly toward them. Nkima, sensing trouble,
remained at the summit, chattering and scolding. Tarzan approached
the two men in silence.</p>

<p>"Wot you want?" demanded Mullargan, reaching for the gun at his
hip.</p>

<p>"You kill?" asked Tarzan, pointing at the dead elephant, and in
his anger, reverting to the monosyllabic grunts which were
reminiscent of his introduction to English many years before.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;so what?" Mullargan's tone was nasty.</p>

<p>"Tarzan kill," said the ape-man, and stepped closer. He was five
feet from Mullargan when the latter whipped his pistol from its
holster and fired. But quick as Mullargan had been, Tarzan had been
quicker. He struck the weapon up, and the bullet whistled
harmlessly into the air; then he tore the gun from the other's hand
and hurled it aside.</p>

<p>Mullargan grinned, a twisted, sneering grin. The poor boob was
pretty fresh, he thought, getting funny like that with the
Heavyweight Champion of the World. "So you're dat Tarzan bum," he
said; then he swung that lethal right of his straight for Tarzan's
chin.</p>

<p>He was much surprised when he missed. He was more surprised when
the ape-man dealt him a terrific blow on the side of the head with
his open palm, a blow that felled him, half-stunned.</p>

<p>Marks danced about in consternation and terror. "Get up, you
bum," he yelled at Mullargan; "get up and kill him."</p>

<p>Nkima jumped up and down at the edge of the gorge, hurling
defiance and insults at the tarmangani. Mullargan came slowly to
his feet. Instinctively, he had taken a count of nine. Now there
was murder in his heart. He rushed Tarzan, and once again the
ape-man made him miss; then Mullargan fell into a clinch, pinning
Tarzan's right arm and striking terrific blows above one of the
ape-man's kidneys, to hurt and weaken him.</p>

<p>With his free hand Tarzan lifted Mullargan from his feet and
threw him heavily to the ground, falling on top of him.
Steel-thewed fingers sought Mullargan's throat. He struggled to
free himself, but he was helpless. A low growl came from the throat
of the man upon him. It was the growl of a beast, and it filled the
champion with a terror that was new to him.</p>

<p>"Help, Joey! Help!" he cried. "The so-an'-so's killin' me."</p>

<p>Marks was the personification of futility. He could only hop
about, screaming: "Get up, you bum; get up and kill him!"</p>

<p>Nkima hopped about too, and screamed; but he hopped and screamed
for a very different reason from that which animated Marks, for he
saw something that the three men, their whole attention centered on
the fight, did not see. He saw a horde of savages coming down out
of the forest on the opposite side of the gorge.</p>

<p>The Babangos, realizing that the three men below them were
thoroughly engrossed and entirely unaware of their presence,
advanced silently, for they wished to take them alive and unharmed.
They came swiftly, a hundred sleek warriors, muscled and hard, a
hundred splendid refutations of the theory that the eating of human
flesh makes men mangy, hairless and toothless.</p>

<p>Marks saw them first, and screamed a warning; but it was too
late, for they were already upon him. By the weight of their
numbers, they overwhelmed the three men, burying Tarzan and
Mullargan beneath a dozen sleek dark bodies; but the ape-man rose,
shaking them from him for a moment. Mullargan saw him raise a
warrior above his head and hurl him into the faces of his fellows,
and the champion was awed by this display of physical strength so
much greater than his own.</p>

<p>This momentary reversal was brief&mdash;there was too many
Babangos even for Tarzan. Two of them seized him around the ankles,
and three more bore him backward to the ground; but before they
succeeded in binding him, he had killed one with his bare
hands.</p>

<p>Mullargan was taken with less difficulty; Marks with none. The
Babangos bound their hands tightly behind their backs; and prodding
them from behind with their spears, drove them up the steep gorge
side into the forest.</p>

<p>Little Nkima watched for a moment; then he fled back across the
plain.</p>

<p>The gloom of the forest was on them, depressing further the
spirits of the two Americans. The myriad close-packed trees, whose
interlaced crowns of foliage shut out the sky and the sun, awed
them. Trees, trees, trees! Trees of all sizes and heights, some
raising their loftiest branches nearly two hundred feet above the
carpet of close-packed phyrnia, amoma, and dwarf bush that covered
the ground. Loops and festoons of lianas ran from tree to tree, or
wound like huge serpents around their boles from base to loftiest
pinnacle. From the highest branches others hung almost to the
ground, their frayed extremities scarcely moving in the dead air;
and other, slenderer cords hung down in tassels with open thread
work at their ends, the air roots of the epiphytes.</p>

<p>"Wot you suppose they goin' to do with us?" asked Marks. "Hold
us for ransom?"</p>

<p>"Mabbe. I don' know. How'd they collect ransom?"</p>

<p>Marks shook his head. "Then what are they goin' to do with
us?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask that big bum?" suggested Mullargan, jerking
his head in the general direction of Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Bum!" Marks spat the word out disgustedly. "He made a bum outta
you, big boy. I wisht I had a bum like that back in Noo York. I'd
have a real champeen then. He nearly kayoed you with the flat of
his hand. What a haymaker he packs!"</p>

<p>"Just a lucky punch," said Mullargan. "Might happen to
anyone."</p>

<p>"He picks you up like you was a flyweight; but when he turns you
down you land like a heavyweight, all right. I suppose 'at was just
luck."</p>

<p>"He ain't human. Did you hear him growl? Just like a lion or
somep'n."</p>

<p>"I wisht I knew what they was goin' to do with us," said
Marks.</p>

<p>"Well, they ain't agoin' to kill us. If they was, they would of
done it back there when they got us. There wouldn't be no sense in
luggin' us somewheres else to kill us."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, at that."</p>

<p>The footpath that the Babangos followed with their captives
wound erratically through the forest. It was scarcely more than
eighteen inches wide, a narrow trough worn deep by the feet of
countless men and beasts through countless years. It led at last to
a rude encampment on the banks of a small stream near its
confluence with a larger river. It was the site of an abandoned
village in a clearing not yet entirely reclaimed by the jungle.</p>

<p>As the three men were led into the encampment, they were
surrounded by yelling women and children. The women spat upon them,
and the children threw sticks at them until the warriors drove them
off; then, with ropes about their necks, they were tied to a small
tree.</p>

<p>Marks, exhausted, threw himself upon the ground; Mullargan sat
with his back against the tree; Tarzan remained standing, his eyes
examining every detail of his surroundings, his mind centered upon
a single subject&mdash;escape.</p>

<p>"Cripes," said Marks. "I'm all in."</p>

<p>"You ain't never used your dogs enough," said Mullargan,
unsympathetically. "You was always keen on me doin' six miles of
road work every day while you loafed in an automobile."</p>

<p>"What was that?" suddenly demanded Marks.</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"Don't you hear it&mdash;them groans?" The sound was coming from
the direction of the stream, which they could not see because of
intervening growth.</p>

<p>"Some guy's got a bellyache," said Mullargan.</p>

<p>"It sounds awful," said Marks. "I wisht I was back in Gawd's
country. You sure had a hell of a bright idea&mdash;comin' to this
Africa. I wisht I knew what they was goin' to do with us."</p>

<p>Mullargan glanced up at Tarzan. "He ain't worryin' none," he
said, "and he ought to know what they're goin' to do with us. He's
a wild man himself."</p>

<p>They had been speaking in whispers, but Tarzan had heard what
they said. "You want to know what they're going to do to you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"We sure do," said Marks.</p>

<p>"They're going to eat you."</p>

<p>Marks sat up suddenly. He felt his throat go dry, and he licked
his lips. "Eat us?" he croaked. "You're kiddin', Mister; they ain't
no cannibals no more, only in movin' pitchers an' story-books."</p>

<p>"No? You hear that moaning coming from the river?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

<p>"That part of it's worse than being eaten."</p>

<p>"They're preparing the meat&mdash;making it tender. Those are
men or women or little children that you hear&mdash;there are
several of them. Two or three days ago, perhaps, they broke their
arms and legs in three or four places with clubs; then they sank
them in the river, tying their heads up to sticks; so they can't
drown by accident or commit suicide. They'll leave them there three
or four days; then they'll cut them up and cook them."</p>

<p>Mullargan turned a sickly yellowish white. Marks rolled over on
his side and was sick. Tarzan looked down on them without pity.</p>

<p>"You are afraid," said Tarzan. "You don't want to suffer. Out on
the plain and in the forest are the zebra and elephant that you
left to suffer, perhaps for many days."</p>

<p>"But they're only animals," said Mullargan. "We're human
bein's."</p>

<p>"You are animals," said the ape-man. "You suffer no more than
other animals, when you are hurt. I am glad that the Babangos are
going to make you suffer before they eat you. You are worse than
the Babangos. You had no reason for hunting the zebra and the
elephant. You could not possibly have eaten all that you killed.
The Babangos kill only for food, and they kill only as much as they
can eat. They are better people than you, who will find pleasure in
killing."</p>

<p>For a long time the three were silent, each wrapped in his own
thoughts. Above the noises of the encampment rose the moans from
the river. Marks commenced to sob. He was breaking. Mullargan was
breaking too, but with a different reaction.</p>

<p>He looked up at Tarzan, who still stood, impassive, above them.
"I been thinkin', Mister," he said, "about what you was sayin'
about us hurtin' the animals an' killin' for pleasure. I ain't
never thought about it that way before. I wisht I hadn't done
it."</p>

<hr>

<p>A little monkey fled across the hot plain. He made a detour to
avoid the lumbering truck following in the wake of the hunters.
Shortly thereafter he took to the trees and swung through them
close to the edge of the plain. He was a terrified little monkey,
constantly on the alert for the many creatures to which monkey meat
is an especial delicacy. It was sad that such an ardent nemophilist
should be afraid in the forest, but that was because Histah the
snake and Sheeta the panther were also arboreal. There were also
large monkeys with very bad dispositions, which it were wise to
avoid; so little Nkima traveled as quietly and unobtrusively as
possible. It was seldom that he traveled, or did anything else,
with such singleness of purpose; but today not even the most
luscious caterpillar, the most enticing fruits, or even a nest of
eggs could tempt him to loiter. Little Nkima was going places,
fast...</p>

<hr>

<p>Melton saw the carcasses of zebra pointing the way the hunters
had gone. He was filled with anger and disgust, and he cursed under
his breath. When he came to the edge of the gorge, he saw the wreck
of the automobile lying beneath the body of a bull elephant; but he
saw no sign of the two men. He got out and went down into the
gorge.</p>

<p>Melton was an experienced tracker. He could read a story in a
crushed blade of grass or a broken twig. A swift survey of the
ground surrounding the wrecked automobile told him a story that
filled him with concern&mdash;for himself. With his rifle cocked,
he climbed back up the side of the gorge toward the truck, turning
his eyes often back toward the forest on the opposite side. It was
with a sigh of relief that he turned the truck about and started
back across the plain.</p>

<p>"The bounders had it coming to them," he thought. "There's
nothing I can do about it but report it, and by that time it will
be too late."</p>

<hr>

<p>That night the Babangos feasted, and Tarzan learned from
snatches of their conversation that they were planning to commence
the preparation of him and the two Americans the following night;
but Tarzan was of no mind to have his arms and legs broken. He lay
down close to Mullargan.</p>

<p>"Turn on your side," he whispered. "I am going to lie with my
back to yours. I'll try to untie the thongs on your wrists; then
you can untie mine."</p>

<p>"Oke," said Mullargan.</p>

<p>Out in the forest toward the plain a lion roared, and the
instant reaction of the Babangos evidenced their fear of the king
of beasts. They replenished their beast-fires and beat their drums
to frighten away the marauder. They were not lion men, these
hunters of humans; but after a while, hearing no more from the
lion, the savages, once again feasting, dancing, drinking, relaxed
their surveillance; and Tarzan was able to labor uninterruptedly
for hours. It was slow work, for his hands were so bound that he
could use the fingers of but one of them at a time; but at least
one knot gave to his perseverance. After that it was easier, and in
another half-hour Mullargan's hands were free. With two hands, he
could work more rapidly; but time was flying. It was long past
midnight. There were signs that the orgy would soon be terminated;
then, Tarzan knew, guards would be placed over them. At last he was
free. Marks' bonds responded more easily.</p>

<p>"Crawl on your bellies after me," Tarzan whispered. "Make no
noise." Mullargan's admission of his regret for the slaughter of
the zebra had determined Tarzan to give the two men a chance to
escape&mdash;that, and the fact that Mullargan had helped to
release him. He felt neither liking nor responsibility for them. He
did not consider them as fellow-beings, but as creatures further
removed from him than the wild beasts with which he had consorted
since childhood: those were his kin and his fellows.</p>

<p>Tarzan inched across the clearing toward the forest. Had he been
alone, he would have depended upon his speed to reach the sanctuary
of the trees where no Babangos could have followed him along the
high-flung pathways that the apes of Kerchak had taught him to
traverse; but the only chance the two behind him had was that of
reaching the forest unobserved.</p>

<p>They had covered scarcely more than a hundred feet when Marks
sneezed. Asthmatic, he had reacted to some dust or pollen that
their movement had raised from the ground. He sneezed, not once but
continuously; and his sneezing was answered by shouts from the
encampment.</p>

<p>"Get up and run!" directed Tarzan, leaping to his feet; and the
three raced for the forest, followed by a horde of yelling
savages.</p>

<p>The Babangos overtook Marks first, the result of neglecting his
road-work; but they caught Mullargan too, just before he reached
the forest. They caught him because he had hesitated momentarily
motivated by what was possibly the first heroic urge of his life,
to attempt to rescue Marks. When they were upon him, and both
rescue and escape were no longer possible, One-punch Mullargan went
berserk.</p>

<p>"Come on, you bums!" he yelled, and planted his famous right on
a black chin. Others closed in on him and went down in rapid
succession to a series of vicious rights and lefts. "I'll learn
you," growled Mullargan, "to monkey with the Heavyweight Champeen
of the World!" Then a warrior crept up behind him and struck him a
heavy blow across his head with the haft of a spear, and One-punch
Mullargan went down and out for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>Tarzan, perched upon the limb of a tree at the edge of the
clearing, had been an interested spectator, correctly interpreting
Mullargan's act of heroism. It was the second admirable trait that
he had seen in either of these tarmangani, and it moved him to a
more active contemplation of their impending fate. Death meant
nothing to him, unless it was the death of a friend, for death is a
commonplace of the jungle; and his, the psychology of the wild
beast, which, walking always with death, is not greatly impressed
by it.</p>

<p>But self-sacrificing heroism is not a common characteristic of
wild beasts. It belongs almost exclusively to man, marking the more
courageous among them. It was an attribute that Tarzan could
understand and admire. It formed a bond between these two most
dissimilar men, raising Mullargan in Tarzan's estimation above the
position held by the Babangos, whom he looked upon as natural
enemies. Formerly, Mullargan had ranked below the Babangos, below
Ungo the jackal, below Dango the hyena.</p>

<p>Tarzan still felt no responsibility for these men, whom he had
been about to abandon to their fate; but he considered the idea of
aiding them, perhaps as much to confound and annoy the Babangos as
to succor Mullargan and Marks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once again Nkima crossed the plain, this time upon the broad,
brown shoulder of Muviro, chief of the white-plumed Waziri. Once
again he chattered and scolded, and his heart was as the heart of
Numa the lion. From the shoulder of Muviro, as from the shoulder of
Tarzan, Nkima could tell the world to go to hell&mdash;and did.</p>

<p>From his slow-moving lorry, Melton saw, in the distance, what
appeared to be a large party of men approaching. He stopped the
lorry and reached for his binoculars.</p>

<p>When he had focused them on the object of his interest, he
whistled.</p>

<p>"I hope they're friendly," he thought. One of his boys had told
him that the Babangos were raiding somewhere in this territory, and
the evidence he had seen around the wrecked automobile seemed to
substantiate the rumor. He saw that the boy beside him had his
rifle in readiness, and drove on again.</p>

<p>When they were closer, he saw that the party consisted of some
hundred white-plumed warriors. They had altered their course so as
to intercept him. He thought of speeding up the truck and running
through them. The situation looked bad to him, for this was
evidently a war party. He called to the boys on top of the load to
get out the extra rifles and to commence firing if he gave the
word.</p>

<p>"Do not fire at them, Bwana," said one of the boys; "they would
kill us all if you did. They are very great warriors."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Melton.</p>

<p>"The Waziris. They will not harm us."</p>

<p>It was Muviro who stepped into the path of the truck and held up
his hand.</p>

<p>Melton stopped.</p>

<p>"Where have you come from?" asked the Waziri chief.</p>

<p>Melton told him of the gorge and what he had found in its
bottom.</p>

<p>"You saw no other white men than your two friends?" asked
Murivo.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I saw a white man who called himself Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Was he with the others when they were captured?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Follow us," said Muviro, "and camp at the edge of the forest.
If your friends are alive, we will bring them back."</p>

<p>Nkima's actions had told Muviro that Tarzan was in trouble, and
this new evidence suggested that he might have been killed or
captured by the same tribe that had surprised the other men.</p>

<p>Melton watched the Waziri swing away at a rapid trot that would
eat up the miles rapidly; then he started his motor and
followed...</p>

<hr>

<p>At the cannibal encampment, the Babangos, sleeping off the
effects of their orgy, were not astir until nearly noon. They were
in an ugly mood. They had lost one victim, and many of them were
nursing sore jaws and broken noses as a result of their encounter
with One-punch Mullargan.</p>

<p>The white men were not in much better shape: Mullargan's head
ached, while Marks ached all over; and every time he thought of
what lay in store for him before they would kill him, he felt
faint.</p>

<p>"They breaks our arms and legs in four places," he mumbled,
"and, then they soaks us in the drink for three days to make us
tender. The dirty bums!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Mullargan. "I been tryin' to forget it."</p>

<p>Tarzan, knowing that the Waziri were not far behind him,
returned to the edge of the plain to look for them. Alone, and in
broad daylight, be knew that not even he could hope to rescue the
Americans from the camp of the Babangos. All day he loitered at the
edge of the plain; and then, there being no sign of the Waziri, he
swung back through the trees toward the cannibal encampment as the
brief equatorial twilight ushered in the impenetrable darkness of
the forest night.</p>

<p>He approached the camp from a new direction, coming down the
little stream in which the remaining victims were stilt submerged.
Above the camp, his nostrils caught the scent of Numa the lion and
Sabor the lioness; and presently he made out their dim forms below
him. They were slinking silently toward the scent of human flesh,
and they were ravenously hungry. The ape-man knew this, for the
scent of an empty lion is quite different from that of one with a
full belly. Every wild beast knows this; so it is far from unusual
to see lions that have recently fed pass through a herd of grazing
herbivores without eliciting more than casual attention.</p>

<p>The silence and hunger of these two stalking lions boded ill for
their intended prey.</p>

<p>A dozen warriors approached Mullargan and Marks. They cut their
bonds and jerked the two men roughly to their feet; then they
dragged them to the center of the camp, where the chief and the
witch-doctor sat beneath a large tree. Warriors stood in a
semi-circle facing the chief, and behind them were the women and
children.</p>

<p>The two Americans were tripped and thrown to the ground upon
their backs: and there they were spread-eagled, two warriors
pinioning each arm and leg. From the foliage of the tree above, an
almost naked white man looked down upon the scene. He was weighing
in his mind the chances of effecting a rescue, but he had no
intention of sacrificing himself uselessly for these two. Beyond
the beast-fires two pairs of yellowish-green unblinking eyes
watched. The tips of two sinuous tails weaved to and fro. A pitiful
moan came from the stream near by; and the lioness turned her eyes
in that direction, but the great black-maned male continued to
glare at the throng within the encampment.</p>

<p>The witch-doctor rose and approached the two victims. In one
hand he carried a zebra's tail, to which feathers were attached; in
the other a heavy club. Marks saw him and commenced to whimper. He
struggled and cried out:</p>

<p>"Save me, kid! Save me! Don't let 'em do this to me!"</p>

<p>Mullargan muttered a half-remembered prayer. The witch-doctor
began to dance around them, waving the zebra's tail over them and
mumbling his ritualistic mumbo-jumbo. Suddenly he leaped in close
to Mullargan and swung his heavy club above the pinioned man; then
Mullargan, Heavyweight Champion of the World, tore loose from the
grasp of the warriors and leaped to his feet. With all the power of
his muscles and the weight of his body, he drove such a blow to the
chin of the witch-doctor as he had never delivered in any ring; and
the witch-doctor went down and out with a broken jaw. A shout of
savage rage went up from the assembled warriors, and a moment later
Mullargan was submerged by numbers.</p>

<p>The lioness approached the edge of the stream and stretched a
taloned paw toward the head of one of the Babangos' pitiful
victims, a woman. The poor creature screamed in terror, and the
lioness growled horribly and struck. The Babangos, terrified,
turned their eyes in the direction of the sounds; and then the lion
charged straight for them, his thunderous roar shaking the ground.
The savages turned and fled, leaving their two victims and the
witch-doctor in the path of the carnivore.</p>

<p>It all happened so quickly that the lion was above Mullargan
before he could gain his feet. For a moment the great beast stood
glaring down at the prostrate man, who lay paralyzed with fright,
staring back into those terrifying eyes. He smelled the fetid
breath and saw the yellow fangs and the drooling jowls, and he saw
something else&mdash;something that filled him with wonder and
amazement&mdash;as Tarzan launched himself from the tree full upon
the back of the great cat.</p>

<p>Mullargan leaped to his feet then and backed away, but was held
by fascinated horror as he waited for the lion to kill the man.
Marks scrambled up and tried to climb the tree, clawing at the
great bole in a frenzy of terror. The lioness had dragged the woman
from the stream and was carrying her off into the forest, her
agonized screams rising above all other sounds.</p>

<p>Mullargan wished to run away, but he could not. He stood fixed
to the ground, watching the incredible. Tarzan's legs were locked
around the small of the lion's body, his steel-thewed arms
encircling the black-maned neck. The lion reared upon his hind
feet, striking futilely at the man-thing upon his back; and mingled
with his roaring and his growling were the growls of the man. It
was the latter which froze Mullargan's blood.</p>

<p>He saw the lion throw himself to the ground and roll over upon
the man in a frantic effort to dislodge him, but when he came to
his feet again the man was still there. One-punch Mullargan had
witnessed many a battle that had brought howls of approval for the
strength or courage of the contestants, but never had he seen such
strength and courage as were being displayed by this almost naked
man in hand-to-hand battle with a lion.</p>

<p>The endurance of a lion is in no measure proportional to its
strength, and presently the great cat commenced to tire. For a
moment it stood squarely upon all four feet, panting; and in that
first moment of opportunity Tarzan released his hold with one hand
and drew his hunting-knife from its scabbard. At the movement, the
lion wheeled and sought to seize his antagonist. The knife flashed
in the firelight and the long blade sank deep behind the tawny
shoulder. Voicing a hideous roar, the beast reared and leaped; and
again the blade was driven home. In a paroxysm of pain and rage,
the great cat leaped high into the air. Again the blade was buried
in its side. Three times the point had reached the lion's heart;
and at last it rolled over on its side, quivered convulsively and
lay still.</p>

<p>Tarzan sprang erect and placed a foot upon the carcass of his
kill, and raising his face to the heavens voiced the hideous
victory cry of the bull ape. Marks' knees gave beneath him, and he
sat down suddenly. Mullargan felt the hairs on his scalp rise. The
Babangos, who had run into the forest to escape the lion, kept on
running to escape the nameless horror of the weird cry.</p>

<p>"Come!" commanded Tarzan; and led the two men toward the
plain&mdash;away from captivity and death and the cannibal
Babangos.</p>

<hr>

<p>Next day, Marks and Mullargan were in camp with Melton. Tarzan
and the Waziri were preparing to leave in pursuit of the Babangos,
to punish them and drive them from the country.</p>

<p>Before the ape-man left, he confronted the two Americans.</p>

<p>"Get out of Africa," he commanded, "and never come back."</p>

<p>"Never's too damn' soon for me," said Mullargan.</p>

<p>"Listen, Mister," said Marks "I'll guarantee you one hundred G.
if you'll come back to Noo York an' fight for me."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned and walked away, joining the Waziri, who were
already on the march. Nkima sat upon his shoulder and called the
tarmangani vile names.</p>

<p>Marks spread his hands, palms up. "Can you beat it, kid?" he
demanded. "He turns down one hundred G. cold! But it's a good thing
for you he did&mdash;he'd have taken that champeenship away from
you in one round."</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded One-punch Mullargan. "Dat bum?"</p>

<h2><a id="S2-1" name="S2-1"></a>I. &mdash; THE HYENA'S VOICE</h2>

<p class="first">A BRONZED giant of a man, naked save for a
breech-clout, stalked silently along a forest trail. It was Tarzan,
moving through his vast jungle domain in the crisp freshness of the
early morning. The forest was more or less open in this section,
with occasional natural clearings in which only a few scattered
trees grew. Consequently Tarzan's progress was rapid&mdash;rapid,
that is, for ground movement. If the jungle had been thick he would
have taken to the trees, and gone hurtling through them with the
strength of an ape and the speed of a monkey. For he was Tarzan of
the Apes, who, despite his many contacts with civilization since
the early days of his young manhood, had retained the fullness of
all his jungle ways and powers. He seemed indifferent to his
surroundings, yet this indifference was deceptive, the result of
his familiarity with the sights and sounds of the jungle. In
reality, every sense in him was on the alert. Tarzan knew, for
example, that a lion was lying in a patch of brush a hundred feet
to his left and that the king of beasts lay beside the partially
eaten carcass of a slain zebra. He saw neither the lion nor the
zebra, but he knew they were there. Usha, the Wind, carried that
information to his sensitive nostrils. Long experience had taught
this man of the jungle the characteristic odors of both lion and
zebra. The spoor of a lion with a full belly is different from that
of a hungry, stalking lion. So Tarzan passed on, unconcerned,
knowing that the lion would not attack. Tarzan preferred the
evidence of his nostrils to any other way of finding things out.
The eyes of a man could deceive him in the twilight and the night,
the ears could be wrongly influenced by imagination. But the sense
of smell never failed. It was always right; it always told a man
what was what. It was unfortunate, therefore, that a man could not
always be traveling up-wind&mdash;either the man himself changed
his direction, or the wind itself shifted. The former case applied
to Tarzan now, as he moved across wind to avoid a stream which he
was not in the mood to swim. Consequently his preternatural sense
of smell, temporarily less useful, yielded place to his other
information-bringing senses.</p>

<p>And so, something was borne in upon his hearing that would have
escaped all ears but his&mdash;the far off cry of Dango, the Hyena.
Tarzan's scalp tingled, as it always did when he heard that
unpleasant sound. Toward all other animals, the crocodile alone
excepted, Tarzan could have respect&mdash;but for Dango, the Hyena,
he could have only contempt. He despised the creature's filthy
habits and loathed its odor. Chiefly because of this last, he
usually avoided the vicinity of Dango whenever he could, lest he be
moved to kill a living creature out of pure hate, which he did not
consider good cause. So long as Dango did not commit evil, Tarzan
spared him&mdash;after all he couldn't kill a beast just because he
didn't like that animal's smell, could he? Besides, it was Dango's
nature to smell the way he did. Tarzan was about to change his
direction once more, this time to avoid getting close to Dango,
when suddenly a new note in Dango's voice caused him to change his
mind completely. It was a strange note, it told of something
unusual.</p>

<p>Tarzan's curiosity was aroused, so he decided to investigate. He
increased his speed. When the forest closed in on him he took to
the trees, hurtling through them in great leaps that ate up the
distance. The monkeys chattered to him as he went past, and he
replied to them with the same rapid sounds, telling them that he
had not time to stop. At any other time he might have paused to
cavort with the baby monkeys, while the mothers looked on in
approval or the fathers tried to inveigle him into playing
coconut-catch with them; but now he was in a hurry to find out what
had put that strange note into Dango's voice. Nevertheless, one
particularly mischievous simian let fly with a coconut without
giving warning. He did not do it viciously, because he knew the
quickness of Tarzan's eye. And he was totally unprepared for
Tarzan's swift return shot. Tarzan caught the missile and flung it
back in almost one and the same motion, and the jungle baseball
went through the monkey's grasp to bounce with a hollow thump
against the hairy chest. A chorus of monkey-laughter rose, and the
mischievous monkey rubbed his chest ruefully with one hand while he
scratched his head sheepishly with the other.</p>

<p>"Play with your brothers," Tarzan sang out. "Tarzan has no time
for games today."</p>

<p>And he increased his speed still more. The voices of Dango and
his fellows came louder and louder to his ears, their smell grew
still more offensive. In mid-air he spat his distaste, but he did
not swerve from his course. And at last, at the edge of a clearing,
he looked down on a sight that was strange indeed in this African
wilderness. There on the ground lay an aeroplane, partially
wrecked. And there, prowling round and round the wreckage, was the
source of the smell Tarzan hated&mdash;a half dozen
slaver-dripping, tongue-rolling hyenas. On soft feet they padded,
round and round in restless motion, occasionally jumping high
against the plane's side in an obvious effort to get at something
within.</p>

<p>Conquering his revulsion, Tarzan dropped lightly to the ground.
Soft as the impact was, though, the hyenas heard and turned
sharply. They snarled, then retreated a little. It is always the
hyena's first impulse to retreat except from things already dead.
Then seeing that Tarzan was alone, some of the bolder among them
inched forward with bared fangs. There was an old and mutual enmity
between this man and the seed of Dango. Tarzan seemed to pay the
hyenas no heed. The bow and quiver of arrows at his back remained
unslung. His hunting knife remained in its sheath. He did not even
raise his spear in menace. He showed his contempt. But he was
watchful. He knew the hyena of old. Cowardly, yes&mdash;but when
goaded by hunger, capable of sudden daring attack with claw and
fang. He smelled their hunger now, and while outwardly he remained
contemptuous, inwardly he was vigilant.</p>

<p>Emboldened by Tarzan's outward indifference, the hyenas moved
closer to him. Then, with a sudden rush, the biggest of them leaped
for his throat! Before the wicked fangs could clamp together around
his throat, Tarzan shot out a bronzed hand, grabbed the beast's
neck. He swung the body once above his head, sent it hurtling with
terrific force against the other hyenas, knocking three to the
ground.</p>

<p>The three were up almost at once but the one remained, and all
the hyenas straightway fell upon the broken body of their leader
and commenced devouring it. Aye, Tarzan of the Apes knew the best
way of handling hyenas.</p>

<p>While they were busy at their loathsome feeding, Tarzan examined
the plane and found it was not totally damaged. One wing was
crumpled and the landing gear was shattered. But what was true of
this thing of wire and metal was not true of the flesh and blood
that had guided it&mdash;the flesh and blood which the hyenas had
been unable to reach. The pilot, encased in his part of the
cockpit, still sat at his controls; but his body was bent forward
in death, his head resting against the instrument board. The plane
was an Italian army ship. Tarzan made a mental note of the number
and insignia. Then clambering onto the wing to reach the cockpit,
he drew away the wreckage from the pilot's accidental tomb and
examined the man more closely.</p>

<p>"Dead&mdash;one, two days," he muttered. "Bullet hole in throat,
a little to the left of larynx. Now, that's strange. I'd say this
man was wounded while in the air. He lived long enough to land his
ship. He had company with him, too. But they didn't shoot him."</p>

<p>It took no special figuring on Tarzan's part to infer that the
dead man had not been alone. The ground around the ship showed
human footprints, not native ones, either, for the feet had been
shod with civilized foot-gear. Also there were a number of
cigarette butts and a piece of a cellophane wrapping. But the
deduction that the pilot had not been shot by his companions
required much closer reasoning. On the face of it, it was
incredible that it could have happened any other way&mdash;if they
didn't shoot him, who did? Yet, a shot from his companions would
have had to come either from the right side or from the rear. The
bullet, however, had penetrated the throat at the left of the
larynx.</p>

<p>A low, jungle oath escaped Tarzan. "Impossible as it may seem,"
he muttered, "this man was shot while in the air&mdash;and not by
his companions either. Who did it then?"</p>

<p>Once again he examined the wound. He shook his head, his brow
furrowed.</p>

<p>"The bullet came down from above... Now how could that be...
unless... unless it came from another plane. That's it. That must
be it! It couldn't have happened in any other way."</p>

<p>A strange mystery, indeed, in the heart of Africa, far from all
traveled air-lanes. Tarzan interpreted its sign, as he would have
read spoor along jungle trails, and the conclusions he reached were
as certain, so certain that he now asked himself:</p>

<p>"Where did the other plane go?"</p>

<p>The sounds the hyenas were making&mdash;the tearing of flesh,
the snufflings and champings and slaverings, the grinding of their
teeth as they devoured one of their own kind&mdash;came to Tarzan
and he spat his disgust. Almost he was minded to spring out with
spear and knife and make an end of them&mdash;make food out of the
feeders, food for vultures. But he muttered to himself: "There are
things here that are more important. Things that have to do with
human beings. They come first."</p>

<p>So he went on with his investigation. He found a single glove, a
right-hand glove. He picked it up, opened it, smelled of the
inside. His nostrils quivered. Then he dropped the glove&mdash;but
he would not soon forget what he had learned from it. He leaped to
the ground. Now the sight of the hyenas at their gruesome work was
coupled with the sounds they made and augmented by their smell.</p>

<p>It was too much for Tarzan. A booming roar broke from his great
chest and he hurtled toward the hyenas, spear brandished
threateningly. They scattered. He knew they would be back to finish
the carcass, but in the meantime, while he finished his survey, he
would at least be free of their offensiveness.</p>

<p>Minutely he examined the ground. "Two men," he said softly.
"They started out"&mdash;he pointed downward, although he was
talking to no one but himself&mdash;"from here. And they
went"&mdash;again he pointed&mdash;"this way. The trail is about
two days old, but not too cold to follow. I'll follow it."</p>

<p>Several motives animated Tarzan's decision. If still alive, the
men who had dropped down from the skies and were now in the jungle,
were fellow human beings who might need help. In addition, those
men were strangers, and it was Tarzan's business to find out who
they were and what they were doing in his domain. Accordingly he
started out with no further deliberation.</p>

<p>Tantor, the Elephant, trumpeted across his path and stood
waiting with ready trunk to swing Tarzan onto his back, but Tarzan
had no time for such luxuries. He could follow the trail better if
close to the ground, so he shouted: "Go back to your herd, Tantor!"
But lest the elephant should feel hurt, Tarzan vaulted upon his
back, gave Tantor a quick rub behind the ears, jumped down and was
off and away on the trail again. Tantor, content, lumbered off to
rejoin his herd, his trunk lifted high.</p>

<p>It was Usha, the Wind, which brought Tarzan his next
interruption. Usha, shifting slightly, transmitted to Tarzan's
nostrils an altogether new scent&mdash;a scent completely at
variance with what anyone would have expected in the fastnesses of
the African jungle. Straightway Tarzan swerved off the trail to
follow up this new sign. Swiftly the odor grew more pronounced
until at last he recognized beyond further doubt the odor of
gasoline. Here again was mystery. Gasoline implied the presence of
man, but he detected no man-odor on the breeze. Still, the gasoline
scent was a kind of advance-evidence that he had been right in his
assumption of the presence of another aeroplane. The assumption was
soon verified by actual sight. There it lay, the mass of crumpled
wreckage that had once been a man-made bird, a ship winging through
the air above Africa. Now it was broken and twisted&mdash;grim
evidence of tragedy. Here, Tarzan knew, was the second half of the
puzzle. This was the other plane, which had held the man, who had
fired the bullet, which had entered the throat of that other man
and killed him. The tail of his plane showed the ravaging effect of
machine-gun fire. Yes, quite evidently there had been a fight in
the air, an unequal fight, for apparently the man in this second
plane had been armed only with a revolver. Unequal or not however,
Man Number Two had managed to escape the fate of Number One. See
there, the trampled grass. Number Two had come back to the plane,
then gone away. Tarzan followed the spoor a short way, came to a
tangled mass of rope and silk.</p>

<p>"Parachute," he said. "Number Two bailed out."</p>

<p>Tarzan's brain was busy. His eyes held a faraway look as he was
reconstructing what must have happened.</p>

<p>"Plane Number One attacked Plane Number Two. That's obvious,
since Number One had a machine gun and Number Two did not. Pilot
Number Two had a revolver. With it, he shot pilot Number One, who
made a forced landing, then died, and was deserted by two
companions. The machine-gun bullets forced down Plane Number Two.
Its pilot bailed out and landed here, several miles from Number
One. All told, then, three men walked away from two planes."</p>

<p>Were they still alive?</p>

<p>"And why has all this happened?" Tarzan wondered.</p>

<p>But for that question he could give no answer. He could figure
out what had happened; but he could not figure out why. And this
jungle, he knew, would probably lock the answer away in death. The
jungle was harsh to those who did not know her ways. The three men
who had been cast away in it had little chance, if they were not
dead already.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. He was not satisfied that this should be
the answer. Humanitarian impulses stirred his breast. Plane Number
Two was English&mdash;its pilot was probably English too, just as
the other two men were probably Italian. In Tarzan's veins ran
English blood. To Tarzan, the life of a man was no better than the
life of an antelope. Tarzan would help an antelope in trouble, and
he would help a man in trouble if that man deserved it. The only
difference was that an antelope in trouble always deserved help
whereas man sometimes did not. But Tarzan could not say one way or
another what these men, and in particular the Englishman,
deserved.</p>

<p>"Englishman," he said to himself, "you first. Let's hope I can
get to you before the lions or the Buiroos do."</p>

<p>So Tarzan set out on the trail of a man whom he did not know.
Tarzan set out on the trail of Lieutenant Cecil Giles-Burton.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="S2-2" name="S2-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE THREAD OF
FATE</h2>

<p class="first">FATE is a thread that connects one event with
another and one human being with another. The thread that was to
lead to Tarzan in the African jungle began in the laboratory of
Horace Brown in Chicago. From Tarzan it led back to Lieutenant
Burton, from Burton it led back to a man named Zubanev in London,
from Zubanev to Joseph Campbell, otherwise known as "Joe the
Pooch," from Campbell to Mary Graham who talked too much, and
finally from Mary Graham to Horace Brown, whose secretary she
was.</p>

<p>It is a long thread, all the way from Chicago to Africa, and
there is blood on it and the promise of more blood to come. Horace
Brown was an American inventor. He had a secretary, Mary Graham,
who was in his confidence and who talked too much. Horace Brown
invented something&mdash;something of extreme military importance.
Mary knew about it, and Mary went to a party. It was at this party
that Mary did her excessive talking. She meant well, but alas, Mary
was not pretty, and usually attempted to make up for this lack of
beauty by sparkling conversation. This time, very unfortunately,
she sparkled to the wrong man&mdash;Joseph Campbell, alias Joe the
Pooch. To Mary a man was a man, and although Campbell was not
particularly attractive, his interest flattered her. And she
mistook his interest in her conversation for interest in herself.
Horace Brown's invention was an electrical device designed to
disrupt the ignition system of any internal combustion engine at
any distance up to three thousand feet.</p>

<p>"You can readily see what that would mean in wartime," Mary said
brightly, gesturing with her left hand not so much for emphasis as
to show that her efficient typist's fingers were naked of either
wedding or engagement ring. "No tanks or other motorized equipment
of the enemy could approach within a thousand yards. Strafing
planes could be brought down before they could inflict any serious
damage on airdromes. Bombers, equipped with these machines, would
be invulnerable to attack by pursuit planes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary rambled on, unaware of Lieutenant Cecil Giles-Burton,
unaware of Zubanev, unaware of Tarzan of the Apes, unaware of all
those people in far off places whose lives she was unconsciously
influencing. She was aware only that here was a man who was showing
interest in her. Joseph Campbell, eyes reflecting
admiration&mdash;admiration for the information he was getting
which she mistook for admiration for herself&mdash;listened with
both ears, a hard head and a flinty heart. He saw possibilities for
profit&mdash;tremendous possibilities, but he was not yet quite
sure how he could go about getting those profits.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see that gadget," he said casually.</p>

<p>"You can't," Mary said. "No one can, at present. It's been
dismantled as a precautionary measure against theft. Mr. Brown has
retained only the drawings, one set of them."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to talk to him anyway," said Campbell, and added
with a meaning glance: "It would give us a chance to see more of
each other. Perhaps I might even finance Mr. Brown."</p>

<p>Mary shook her head regretfully. "I'm afraid that's impossible,
too. Mr. Brown is on his way to London to negotiate with the
British Government. You see, he means for only the two countries to
have the invention..."</p>

<p>Thus did Mary Graham innocently weave the first length of fate's
bloody thread. When Joseph Campbell took leave of Mary Graham that
night, he promised to call her the following evening. That was the
last she heard of him. Joseph Campbell faded out of her life, just
as Mary Graham, at this point, fades out of this narrative...</p>

<p>On the other side of the Atlantic a week later, Horace Brown,
having arrived at a satisfactory arrangement with the British
Government, was assembling his machine in a small machine-shop in
London. Since it was assumed that no one but himself and the
authorities knew what he was doing, no unusual precautions were
taken to safeguard him. Two reliable mechanics assisted him during
the day. At night he took the plans home with him to the small
boarding-house where he had found a room because it was close to
his work.</p>

<p>Nikolai Zubanev, a Russian exile, was also a boarder there. He
was a mysterious little man, but apparently harmless. Quite
evidently the government did not consider him to be harmless, for
it was having him watched as a matter of routine, only Zubanev did
not know that. Neither did another boarder, a recent arrival from
America who had become friendly with Zubanev.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the government's watchfulness, Horace Brown one
morning was found murdered and his plans missing. Missing, too,
were Mr. Zubanev and his new-found acquaintance, Campbell.</p>

<p>The government tapped its many and varied sources of
information. A week later Messrs. Campbell and Zubanev were located
in Rome, Italy. The meaning of this was plain&mdash;they had gone
there to sell the stolen plans to the Italian Government.</p>

<p>British agents in Rome got busy. Simultaneously, Lieut. Cecil
Giles-Burton took off from Croydon in a fast plane for the Italian
capital. The newspapers said that he was making a flight to
Capetown, Africa.</p>

<p>There was only one man in Italy before whom Campbell and Zubanev
wished to lay their proposition, and it wasn't easy to obtain an
interview with him. Zubanev, trusting no one, conceived a plan to
safeguard the drawings should the Italian authorities decide to
take them from him by force. He hid them in the false bottom of a
handbag, and left them in his hotel room.</p>

<p>At the interview, the Great Man became intensely interested. A
price was agreed upon&mdash;such a price as would make both men
independent for life, provided, of course, that the experimental
machine to be built from the drawings could do what it was designed
to accomplish.</p>

<p>Campbell and Zubanev exuded elation as they returned to their
apartment. Their elation, however, died on the threshold as they
opened the door to Zubanev's room. Someone had been there during
their absence and taken the place apart, forgetting to put it
together again. Zubanev rushed to the bag with the false bottom.
The bag was there, and so was the false bottom&mdash;but the plans
were gone!</p>

<p>Frantic, they telephoned the Great Man, and things immediately
commenced to happen. Orders were issued to search everyone leaving
Rome and to repeat the search at every border. But a certain
airport reported than an Englishman, Lieut. Cecil Giles-Burton, had
taken off twenty-five minutes before the search order had been
received, presumably for Capetown. A hasty investigation revealed
the further fact that the said aviator had been stopping at the
same hotel as Campbell and Zubanev, and that he had checked out
only about a half hour before their return and discovery of their
loss.</p>

<p>Within the hour, Campbell and Zubanev took off in a fast
military pursuit plane piloted by a Lieut. Torlini.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="S2-3" name="S2-3"></a>III. &mdash; BROKEN WINGS</h2>

<p class="first">THE blue waters of the Mediterranean rolled below
Lieut. Cecil Giles-Burton as he winged south toward the African
shore. So far, the undertaking had progressed with extraordinary
success and it would have been quite simple to circle to the west
now, and swing back to London. But there were reasons for his not
doing so. His orders were to continue south to Bangali, where his
father was Resident Commissioner. He was to leave the purloined
plans with his father and continue on to Capetown, just as if this
was really a sporting flight, as the newspapers had announced. For
the British Government thought it unwise to permit a friendly power
to suspect that its agents had stolen the plans from under the nose
of the Great Man, even though they had originally been stolen from
them. And because Lieutenant Burton's father was Resident
Commissioner at Bangali, the lieutenant had been selected for the
mission. What could be more natural than that the son should stop
to visit his father on his flight to Capetown? In fact, the
government records would show that he had asked permission to do
so.</p>

<p>Although Bangali had an emergency airport, it was off the main
traveled air route, and there was a question as to whether or not a
plane could be refueled there, so Burton decided to land at Tunis
and fill his tanks. While he was refueling at the Tunis airport, a
little crowd of the curious surrounded his ship. The formalities of
the French airport were quickly and pleasantly attended to, and
while he was chatting with a couple of the officials, a native
approached him.</p>

<p>"The Italians," he said in excellent English, "may beat you to
Capetown, if you remain here too long."</p>

<p>"Oh," said one of the Frenchmen, "a race. I did not know
that."</p>

<p>Burton thought swiftly. He was being pursued! And the Italian
Government was seeking to give the impression that it was just a
sportsman's race.</p>

<p>"It really isn't an official contest," said Burton, laughing.
"Just a private wager with some Italian friends. If I don't want to
lose, I'd better be hopping off."</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was in the air again and winging south
with wide-open throttle, grateful for the ingenuity and
thoughtfulness of his confederates in Rome and the cleverness of
their agent, the "native" in Tunis. Burton had lost half an hour at
Tunis, but it would soon be dark, and if his pursuers did not come
within sight of him soon, he hoped to lose them during the night.
He was flying a straight course for Bangali, which would take him
east of an airline course for Capetown and west of the regular
airlane from Cairo to the Cape, the route that they might
reasonably expect him to fly because of its far greater safety.
Occasionally he glanced back, and finally, in the last rays of the
setting sun, he saw the shimmering silver reflected from the lower
surface of the wings of an airplane far behind. All night that
plane followed him, guided by the flames from his exhaust. It was a
faster ship and hung doggedly on his trail.</p>

<p>He wondered what the enemy's plans were. He knew they didn't
want him; it was the papers he carried that they wanted. If he
could reach Bangali, the plans would be safe, for he would find
ample protection there.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. When dawn broke, the pursuing plane had
drawn up beside him. Its wing-tip almost touched his. He saw that
it was an Italian military pursuit plane, piloted by an Italian
officer. The two passengers he did not recognize, although he
assumed that they were Campbell and Zubanev, whom he had never
seen.</p>

<p>Open country lay beneath them, and the Italian officer was
motioning him down. He believed that Bangali was not more than
fifty miles away. When he shook his head at them, they turned the
machine gun on him. He banked and dove, and banked again, coming up
under their tail.</p>

<p>His only weapon, was a service pistol. He drew it and fired up
at the belly of the ship, hoping that he might be lucky enough to
sever one of the controls. As the other ship banked and turned, he
zoomed up.</p>

<p>They were coming from behind now, and coming fast. He turned and
fired four more shots into them, and then a burst of machine-gun
fire tore away his rudder and stabilizer.</p>

<p>Out of control, his ship went into a spin. He had done his best,
but he had failed. Cutting the engine, he bailed out with his
parachute and floated gently down to earth. As he was floating
downward, he watched the other ship. It was behaving erratically,
and he wondered if he had hit the pilot or damaged the controls.
The last he saw of it, it disappeared low over a forest a few miles
to the south.</p>

<p>Thus the two ships went down to land at the separate spots where
Tarzan of the Apes was afterward to find and wonder over them.</p>

<p>Burton quickly came to his feet and unbuckled the harness of his
parachute. He looked about him. No living creature was in sight. He
was in the midst of an African wilderness, with only a hazy notion
of the distance to Bangali, which lay, he believed, a little east
of south. His plane lay, a crumpled mass of wreckage, a few hundred
yards away. He was glad he had cut the engine and that his ship had
not burned, for it contained a little food and some extra
cartridges. He figured that he was in a hell of a fix, and he
was&mdash;much worse than he realized. But the plans for which he
had risked his life were buttoned securely inside his shirt. He
felt of them to make sure that they were still there. Satisfied, he
walked over to the wrecked plane and got ammunition and food. He
set off immediately in the direction in which he thought Bangali
lay, for he knew that if his pursuers had made a safe landing they
would be looking for him.</p>

<p>If Bangali were only fifty miles away, as he hoped, and lay in
the direction he believed it did, he felt that he might reasonably
expect to reach it on the third day. He prayed that he was not in
lion country, and, if there were natives, that they were friendly.
But he was in lion country, and what natives there were were not
friendly&mdash;and Bangali was three hundred miles away.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="S2-4" name="S2-4"></a>IV. &mdash; JUNGLE CALL</h2>

<p class="first">TWO days were to pass before the thread which
began with Horace Brown in Chicago, and was already soaked in one
spot with Horace Brown's blood, was to reach out and wind itself
about the hyena-hating Tarzan in Africa. The third day found Tarzan
of the Apes following the cold trail of the Englishman, Cecil
Giles-Burton.</p>

<p>Then fate played a queer trick. Cecil Giles-Burton, who had
never set foot in Africa before, passed unharmed through the
country of the savage Buiroos&mdash;but Tarzan of the Apes, born
and bred in this land and the master of its lore, was ambushed,
wounded and captured!</p>

<p>It happened in this way: Tarzan was approaching a forest growth
down-wind, hence the scent-spoor of any life ahead of him could not
come to his sensitive nostrils. Thus he could not know that a score
of Buiroo warriors were advancing through the forest in his
direction. They were hunting, therefore moved silently, so Tarzan
neither heard nor smelled them as they came on.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a lion broke suddenly from the forest
a little to his left. Blood was running from a wound in the lion's
side, and it was in an ugly mood. The beast bounded past him a few
yards, then abruptly turned and charged directly at him. Tarzan, in
perfect calm, raised his short, heavy spear above his right
shoulder and waited. And now his back was toward the forest. It was
then that the Buiroos came upon him from behind. Their surprise was
great, but it did not deter their action.</p>

<p>Chemungo, son of Mpingu the chief, recognized the white man,
recognized him as Tarzan&mdash;Tarzan who had once robbed the
village of a captive who was to be tortured and
sacrificed&mdash;Tarzan who had made a fool of Chemungo into the
bargain. Chemungo wasted no time. He hurled his spear, and the
white man went down with the weapon quivering in his back. But the
other warriors did not forget the lion. With loud shouts they
rushed upon him, holding their enormous shields in front of
them.</p>

<p>The beast leaped for the foremost warrior, striking the shield
and throwing the man to the ground where the shield protected him
while his fellows surrounded the lion and drove home their weapons.
Once more the lion charged, and once again a warrior went down
beneath his shield, but now a spear found the savage heart and the
battle was over.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the village of Mpingu the Chief
when the warriors returned with a white prisoner and the carcass of
a lion. Their rejoicing, however, was tempered with some misgivings
when they discovered that their prisoner was the redoubtable
Tarzan. Some, incited by the village witch doctor, advocated
killing the prisoner at once, lest he invoke his powers of magic to
do them injury. Others, however, counseled setting him free,
arguing that the spirit of the murdered Tarzan might do them
infinitely more harm than Tarzan alive.</p>

<p>Torn between two opposing ideas, Mpingu compromised. He ordered
the prisoner to be securely bound and guarded, and his wounds
treated. If, by the time he got well, nothing untoward had
happened, they would treat him as they treated other prisoners; and
then there would be dancing&mdash;and eating!</p>

<p>Tarzan had stopped bleeding. The wound would have killed an
ordinary man, but Tarzan was no ordinary man. Already he was
planning his escape. His bonds were tight, and his captors took
great pains to keep them that way. Each night they tightened them
anew, wondering at the great strength that enabled the man to
loosen them at least enough to cause the blood in his arms and legs
to flow less sluggishly. This nightly tightening of his bonds
became a serious problem to Tarzan. It was more than that&mdash;it
was an insult to his natural dignity.</p>

<p>"A man without the use of his arms," he thought, "is only half a
man. A man without the use of his arms and legs is not a man at
all. He is a child, who must be fed like a child, as the Buiroos
are feeding me."</p>

<p>And Tarzan's heart swelled with the indignity of it, an
indignity thrice multiplied at being fed by a degenerate people
like the Buiroos. Yet what availed the swelling of Tarzan's heart,
if his wrists and ankles could not swell, too&mdash;swell and burst
his bonds? Tarzan's great heart burned within his breast, but his
brain remained cool.</p>

<p>"They feed me to fatten me," his brain told him. "A man of
muscle would make too tough eating for them. So they seek to put
over me a layer of succulent fat. Is this a fit end for
Tarzan&mdash;to wind up in the bellies of Buiroos? No, it is not a
fit end for Tarzan&mdash;nor will it be the end! Tarzan will surely
think of something."</p>

<p>So Tarzan thought of this and that, and dismissed each thought
in turn as useless. But his five senses, more highly developed than
those of any other men, remained in tune. Three of those senses did
not matter much in his present condition. He could see, but of what
use was sight when a man had only the walls of a mean hut to look
at? What mattered touch when a man's hands and feet were bound?
What good was taste when it meant tasting food not acquired by his
own strong hands but fed to him by Buiroos, so that his muscles
should take on a layer of fat to melt on their tongues and delight
their palates? No, two senses alone&mdash;hearing and
smell&mdash;still meant something. And over and above them the
mysterious sixth sense that Tarzan possessed to a degree unknown to
other men.</p>

<p>So the days and nights passed, with Tarzan thinking in his
waking hours and thinking even in his dreams. He was more alive
than ever to all sounds and all smells; but more important than
that, his sixth sense was alive to the jungle and any message it
might bring him. Messages there were many, but he waited for the
one that would bring him hope. He heard Sheetah, the Leopard. There
was no hope there. He heard Dango again, and smelled the beast with
his old disgust. Numa, the Lion, voiced his hunger grunt from far
away. Tarzan's keen ears heard it, but the sound was meaningless
except to introduce the passing thought that it was nobler to be
eaten by a lion than by Buiroos.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan&mdash;or rather Tarzan's sixth sense&mdash;received
another message. A faint glow of surprise appeared in his eyes, his
nostrils quivered. Soon after that, Tarzan began to sway his torso
backward and forward, gently, and a low chanting sound began to
issue from his lips. The guard at the hut's opening peered in, saw
Tarzan's gentle swaying, and asked: "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Tarzan interrupted his motion and chant only long enough to say,
"Praying." Then he resumed.</p>

<p>The guard reported what he had seen to Mpingu. Mpingu grunted
and said that the gods of the Buiroos were more powerful than
Tarzan's.</p>

<p>"Let him pray," Mpingu said. "It will not save him. Soon our
teeth and tongues will know him."</p>

<p>The guard returned to the hut, resumed his post. Tarzan was
still swaying and chanting, only a little louder now. He waited for
the guard to tell him not to, but the guard said nothing, wherefore
Tarzan knew that his plan was working. The message still came to
him, but now it was more than a message received by his sixth
sense. The message was coming to his nostrils now,
unmistakable!</p>

<p>But Tarzan was careful. He was sending out a call, but he
increased its volume only gradually, so that the illusion of prayer
could be kept in the minds of the Buiroos. And so gradually did the
sounds he made increase in volume, that from one minute to the next
the change was scarcely noticeable.</p>

<p>It was all at once that the Buiroos realized that Tarzan's voice
was very loud, and for still another minute they explained it by
the supposition that Tarzan could not make his gods listen to him.
Then they heard, bursting upon their ear-drums, like thunder when
the skies are black and angry, Tarzan's great bellow. There was
sudden quiet...</p>

<p>Deep in the jungle, Tantor, the Elephant, lifted his head to the
night breeze, and the forepart of his trunk curled up
spasmodically. His ears flapped. He turned partway around to face
the breeze fully. Once more he sniffed&mdash;and then he trumpeted.
He trumpeted, calling his herd together. They came, stood up-wind
with him, listened, heard what he heard. They had wandered far, out
of their usual stamping grounds, following their leader
submissively, for their leader had been very restless the last few
days, as though seeking something, and they had feared to cross his
will. Now they knew what had made him restless and what had drawn
him, and now they, too, shook the air with their own trumpetings,
trampled the ground with impatience, waiting only the signal from
their leader to set out.</p>

<p>Tantor gave the awaited signal&mdash;and the herd marched! It
marched quickly, steadily, remorselessly&mdash;straight for its
goal. It marched without swerving, except for the great trees. The
saplings it juggernauted down as if they were matchwood. Straight
and true, the great herd marched on the Buiroo village...</p>

<p>Tarzan, in his captive's lair, was the first to hear the thunder
of the oncoming herd. His eyes lit up and his lips twisted in a
smile. His "prayers" had been heard! His deliverance came on
apace&mdash;faster, faster&mdash;nearer, nearer!</p>

<p>Panicky cries rose in the outer air. Tarzan heard the ripping
and rending of wood as the elephants pushed against the village
stockade.</p>

<p>Crash! A whole section of the stockade came shattering down. The
elephants were in!</p>

<p>"Tantor! Tantor!" Tarzan's great voice called.</p>

<p>"Tantor! Tantor!" his voice yelled out. "Come to me!"</p>

<p>But Tantor needed no vocal invitation to come to Tarzan. The
scent of his man-friend alone was enough, and Tarzan's voice merely
confirmed Tantor's knowledge of his presence there. Tarzan heard
the swoop of Tantor's trunk above him. The entire thatched roof of
the hut he was in was swept away. Looking up, Tarzan beheld the
tremendous bulk of Tantor, and beyond that the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>The next instant Tantor's trunk dipped down, encircled Tarzan,
lifted him and hung him up on his back. Tantor lifted his trunk,
waited. Now Tarzan and not Tantor was in command of the herd. And
it was Tarzan, with his great voice, who signaled that it was time
to depart. The village was a shambles now, not a hut left standing,
and the Buiroos had retreated in terror into the bush.</p>

<p>Triumphantly, the herd left the village behind. Dawn was
breaking. Tantor and the herd had done its job. It was the monkeys
and not the elephants who loosened Tarzan's bonds, and hopped about
him, chattering with delight at seeing him again. Tarzan rubbed
Tantor behind the ears, and Tantor knew he was being thanked. Then,
taking leave of his jungle friends, Tarzan swung off into the trees
and disappeared from their sight. There was no use any more, he
knew, in following the spoor of the English aviator. Very likely
the poor fellow had already died, either of starvation or beneath
the fangs and talons of one of the great carnivorous beasts. No,
Tarzan's destination now lay elsewhere&mdash;specifically in
Bangali.</p>

<p>Nights before, while lying captive, he had heard native African
drums relaying a message from the Resident Commissioner in Bangali
to his friend Tarzan of the Apes&mdash;a message for Tarzan to come
to Bangali.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="S2-5" name="S2-5"></a>V. &mdash; THE SAFARI</h2>

<p class="first">HOW Lieutenant Cecil Giles-Burton survived his
aimless wanderings in the jungle was one of those miracles that
sometimes happen in Africa. The Dark Continent, cruel to those who
did not know her, spared this man. And the section of Fate's thread
which bound him indirectly to a talkative maiden in far-off Chicago
was not yet moistened with his own blood.</p>

<p>On two occasions Burton met lions. In each case, fortunately, a
tree was handy, and he climbed it. One of those lions had been
ravenously hungry and was on the hunt. Burton was treed by it for a
whole day. He thought he would die of thirst. But at last the
lion's patience was snapped by its own hunger, and it went off
after less difficult game. The other lion Burton need not have
worried about. Its belly was full and it would have paid no
attention even to a fat zebra, its favorite food. But Burton,
unlike Tarzan, could not tell the difference between a hungry lion
and a sated one. Also, like most people ignorant of jungle ways, he
held the notion that all lions were man-eaters and went about
killing every living creature they could reach.</p>

<p>The getting of food was Burton's chief problem. He lost weight
rapidly. He ate many strange things, such as locusts, and came to
understand that a hungry man will eat anything.</p>

<p>The days passed swiftly, and he was still searching for Bangali;
but he was searching in the wrong direction. His clothes hung in
rags. His hair and beard grew long. But his courage remained. Thin
as a rail, he was still full of hope as one morning he sat upon a
hillside looking down into a little valley. His hearing had
sharpened since his sojourn in the jungle, and now, suddenly, he
heard sounds coming from the upper end of the valley. He
looked&mdash;and saw men. Men! Human beings! The first he had seen
in days and days! His heart pounded, swelled in his now bony
chest.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to jump up and run down to them, crying
aloud his joy. Then he restrained himself. Africa had taught him
caution. Instead of rushing down, he concealed himself behind a
bush and watched. He would look before he leaped.</p>

<p>It was a long file of men. As they came closer, he saw that some
of them wore sun-helmets. But the majority of them wore not much of
anything. He noted that those who wore the least clothing carried
the heaviest burdens. He knew what he was seeing now. It was a
safari&mdash;a safari of white men and blacks.</p>

<p>Now he no longer hesitated. He rushed down to meet it. The
column was headed by a native guide and a group of whites. There
were two women among the whites. Behind them trooped the long file
of porters and askaris.</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello!" Burton shouted in a cracked voice. Tears came to
his eyes and he choked, stumbling toward them with arms
outstretched.</p>

<p>The safari halted and awaited his coming. No answering shouts of
greeting came to him. He slowed his pace. Something of his habitual
English reserve returned to him. He wondered at their lack of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"How awful," one of the women&mdash;no more than a
girl&mdash;exclaimed at the soiled sight of him. But the
exclamation was less in pity than in impolite shock at his
scarecrow appearance.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Burton stiffened and his cracked lips twisted in a
crooked smile that held a little bitterness. Was this the way a
castaway was received by his own kind? Lieutenant Burton, looking
at the girl, said quietly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Lady Barbara, that in your shock at my dirty rags,
you fail to see that a human being is wearing them."</p>

<p>The girl stared at him, aghast. Over her face spread a
flush.</p>

<p>"You know me?" she said unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Quite well. You are Lady Barbara Ramsgate. That
gentleman&mdash;or am I wrong in using the word?&mdash;is your
brother, Lord John. The others I do not know."</p>

<p>"He must have heard rumors about our safari," one of the other
men interposed. "That's how he knows the names. Well, man, what's
your story? I suppose your safari deserted you, and you're lost and
hungry, and want to join up with our safari. You're not the first
derelict we picked up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it, Gault," John Ramsgate snapped in an angry voice. "Let
the man tell his story."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Burton shook his head. He sent a burning glance at
each of them in turn.</p>

<p>"As snobbish in Africa as in London," he said softly. "One of
your porters, meeting me like this, would not have asked questions,
would have given me food and water even if it meant going without
it himself."</p>

<p>Gault opened his mouth to make a hot retort, but the girl
stopped him. She looked ashamed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said. "We've all been under a strain and I'm
afraid our veneer has cracked a bit to reveal that we're not as
nice as we think we are underneath. I'll order food and water for
you immediately."</p>

<p>"No hurry now," Burton said. "I'll answer your unspoken
questions first. I was flying from London to Capetown, and was
forced down. I have been wandering around ever since, trying to
find Bangali. You are the first human beings I've seen. Permit me
to introduce myself. My name is Burton&mdash;Lieutenant Cecil
Giles-Burton, of the Royal Air Force."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Lady Barbara exclaimed. "You can't be."</p>

<p>"We know Burton," said Lord John. "You don't look anything like
him."</p>

<p>"Blame Africa for that. I think if you look closely enough,
you'll recognize your week-end guest at Ramsgate Castle."</p>

<p>And Lord John, looking closer, finally murmured, "Gad, yes," and
stretched out his hand. "My apologies, old fellow."</p>

<p>Burton did not take the hand. His shoulders sagged. He was
ashamed of these people.</p>

<p>"That hand which you now offer to Lieutenant Burton should have
been offered to the derelict stranger," he said quietly. "I'm
afraid I can't shake it sincerely."</p>

<p>"He's right," Lord John said to his sister, and she nodded
meekly. "We're terribly sorry, Burton. I'd be honored very much if
you took my hand, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>So Burton shook his hand, and they all felt better. Lady Barbara
introduced him to the man who stood at her side&mdash;Duncan Trent.
After eating, Burton met the other members of the safari. There was
a tall, broad-shouldered man who was called Mr. Romanoff, and it
was Romanoff who gave Burton the astounding information that
Bangali was fully two hundred miles away. Romanoff imparted this
information while being shaved by his valet, Pierre. Evidently this
Russian expatriate traveled in style. Burton learned further that
this safari was really two safaris.</p>

<p>"We ran into the Romanoff safari two weeks ago, and, since we
were both headed in the same direction, for Bangali, we joined
forces. The difference is that the Romanoff safari hunts with guns
while we hunt only with cameras."</p>

<p>"Silly idea," said Trent, who was evidently interested in Lady
Barbara emotionally. "John could have gone to the zoo and taken his
silly pictures without all this walking and insect bites."</p>

<p>Burton further learned that Gerald Gault, the man who had spoken
so sneeringly to him at first, was Romanoff's guide. There was
another Russian in the safari, Sergei Godensky, a professional
photographer.</p>

<p>The interest of Burton was drawn to two other white men. These
were the other derelicts that had been mentioned. Their names were
Smith and Peterson. They had told a story of their native boys
deserting them.</p>

<p>"They don't look very gay," Burton said.</p>

<p>"They don't like to do their share of the work, either," John
Ramsgate snapped. "Burton, you won't blame us so much for our
conduct when you learn more about this rather mixed safari.
Romanoff's man, Gault, is domineering and sarcastic. Everybody
hates him. Pierre and my valet, Tomlin, are both in love with
Violet, Barbara's maid. And I think there's no love lost between
Godensky and Romanoff. All told, I wouldn't call it a very happy
family."</p>

<p>Coffee and cigarettes followed the dinner. Burton stretched and
inhaled deeply.</p>

<p>"To think," he said, "that only this morning I was expecting to
starve to death. One never knows what Fate has in store for
one."</p>

<p>Unconsciously he patted his shirt over his heart, where the
plans for Horace Brown's invention reposed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just as well that we can't look into the future,"
said Lady Barbara. It was just as well, so far as Burton's peace of
mind was concerned.</p>

<p>Days passed. Burton grew very fond of John Ramsgate and
especially fond of Barbara. Duncan Trent began to wear a scowl. In
Burton he detected a rival.</p>

<p>Then trouble broke out in the safari over the maid, Violet, when
Godensky made advances to her which she made clear she did not
want. Burton, accidentally coming upon them, knocked Godensky down.
Godensky, in a raging fury, drew his knife. Then Lady Barbara came
suddenly upon the scene. Godensky put back his knife and walked
away sullenly.</p>

<p>"You've made an enemy," cautioned Barbara.</p>

<p>Burton shrugged his shoulders. He had been through so much
already that one more enemy didn't matter.</p>

<p>But he had made more than one enemy. Trent came to him and told
him in no uncertain terms to keep away from Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"I think we can leave it to Lady Barbara to select what company
she wants to keep," Burton said quietly.</p>

<p>Tomlin, attracted by the conversation, came out of his tent. He
saw Trent strike at Burton, saw Burton smash Trent down.</p>

<p>"Get into your tent and cool off," Burton snapped to Trent, and
entered his own tent.</p>

<p>The next morning, Ramsgate notified Godensky that he would not
need his services after they reached Bangali. Everyone else ignored
Godensky, even the two derelicts, Smith and Peterson, and he
marched alone all day, nursing his anger. Duncan Trent brought up
the rear of the column, glum and brooding.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed out of sorts, and the long trek under the hot,
merciless sun did nothing to soothe jangled nerves. The carriers
lagged, and Gault spent most of his time running up and down the
line cursing and abusing them.</p>

<p>Finally he lost his temper and knocked one of them down. When
the man got up, Gault knocked him down again. Burton, who was
nearby, interfered.</p>

<p>"Cut it out," he ordered.</p>

<p>"You mind your own damned business. I'm running this safari,"
retorted Gault.</p>

<p>"I don't care whose safari you're running. You're not going to
abuse the men."</p>

<p>Gault swung. Burton blocked the blow, and the next instant Gault
was sent sprawling with a smashing left to the jaw.</p>

<p>It was Burton's third fight since he had joined the safari.
Three knockdowns&mdash;three enemies.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Ramsgate," Burton said, later. "I seem to be getting
into trouble with everyone."</p>

<p>"You did just right," said Ramsgate approvingly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've made a real enemy there, Cecil," said Lady
Barbara. "I understand Gault has a pretty bad reputation."</p>

<p>"One enemy more makes no difference any longer. We'll be in
Bangali tomorrow."</p>

<p>They talked for a few minutes longer and then, bidding each
other good night, went to their tents.</p>

<p>Burton was happy. He knew that he had never been so happy before
in his life. Tomorrow he would see his father. Tomorrow he would
fulfill his mission; and he was in love. A serene quiet lay upon
the camp, over which a drowsy askari kept watch. From far away came
the roar of a hunting lion, and the man threw more wood upon the
fire.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="S2-6" name="S2-6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE COMING OF
TARZAN</h2>

<p class="first">IT was just before dawn, and it was very cold. The
askari on guard was even more sleepy than the man he had relieved.
Because it was cold, he sat very near the fire with his back
against a log, and sitting there, he fell asleep. When he awoke, he
was so astounded and startled by the sight that met his eyes that
he was for the moment incapable of any action. He just sat there,
wide-eyed, looking at an almost-naked white man who squatted near
him, warming his hands at the fire.</p>

<p>Where had this apparition come from? It had not been there a
moment before. The askari thought that perhaps he was dreaming.
But, no. The visitor was too real, of such an immense physique. The
lips of the stranger parted.</p>

<p>"Whose safari is this?" he asked in the Swahili dialect.</p>

<p>The askari found his voice.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes went even wider and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"If you are a demon," he said, "I will bring you food, if you
will not harm me."</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," said the stranger. "Whose safari is this?"</p>

<p>"There are two," replied the askari, his eyes filled with awe.
"One is the safari of Bwana Romanoff, and the other is the safari
of Bwana Ramsgate."</p>

<p>"They are going to Bangali?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tomorrow we shall be in Bangali."</p>

<p>"They are hunting?"</p>

<p>"Bwana Romanoff hunts. Bwana Ramsgate takes pictures."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at him for a long time before he spoke again, and
then he said:</p>

<p>"You should be whipped for falling asleep while on guard."</p>

<p>"But I was not asleep, Tarzan," said the askari. "I only closed
my eyes because the light of the fire hurt them."</p>

<p>"The fire was nearly out when I came," said Tarzan. "I put more
wood upon it. I have been here a long time and you were asleep.
Simba could have come into camp and carried someone away. He is out
there now, watching you."</p>

<p>The askari leaped to his feet and cocked his rifle.</p>

<p>"Where? Where is Simba?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Can't you see his eyes blazing out there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tarzan, I see them now." He raised his rifle to his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do not shoot. You might accidentally hit him only to wound him,
and then he would charge. Wait."</p>

<p>Tarzan picked up a stick, one end of which was blazing, and
hurled it out into the darkness. The eyes disappeared.</p>

<p>"If he comes back, shoot over his head. That may frighten him
away."</p>

<p>The askari became very alert, but he was watching the stranger
quite as much as he was watching for the lion. Tarzan warmed
himself by the fire. After a while the wind freshened and swung
into a new quarter. Tarzan raised his head and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"Who is the dead man?" he asked.</p>

<p>The askari looked around him quickly, but saw no one. His voice
trembled a little as he answered.</p>

<p>"There is no dead man, Bwana," the askari protested.</p>

<p>"There is a dead man over there in that part of camp," said
Tarzan, nodding toward the tents of the whites.</p>

<p>"There is no dead man, and I wish that you would go away with
your talk of death."</p>

<p>The other did not answer. He just squatted there, warming his
hands.</p>

<p>"I must go and awaken the cooks," the askari said, presently.
"It is time."</p>

<p>Tarzan said nothing, and the askari went to awaken the cooks. He
told them there was a demon in the camp, and when they looked and
saw the white man squatting there by the fire, they, too became
intensely frightened. They were still more frightened when the
askari told them that the demon had said there was a dead man in
the camp. They woke up all the other boys, for in numbers there is
a greater sense of security. Ramsgate's headman went to his
master's tent and awakened him.</p>

<p>"There is a demon in camp, Bwana," he said, "and he says there
is a dead man here. There is no dead man in camp, is there,
Bwana?"</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;and there are no demons either. I'll be out
in a moment."</p>

<p>Ramsgate dressed hurriedly and came out a few moments later to
see the men huddled together fearfully, looking toward the fire,
where the almost naked gigantic white man squatted.</p>

<p>Ramsgate walked toward him, and as he approached the other
arose, courteously.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," said Ramsgate, "who you are and to what we owe
the pleasure of this visit?"</p>

<p>Ramsgate had learned a lesson from Burton on how to treat
strangers. The other motioned toward the fire.</p>

<p>"That is the reason for my visit," he said. "It is unusually
cold in the forest tonight."</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway, man, and what are you doing running around
naked in the forest at night?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," replied the stranger. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Ramsgate. What is the story you have been telling our boys
about there being a dead man in the camp?"</p>

<p>"It is true. There is a dead man in one of those tents. He has
not been dead very long."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that? What gives you that queer idea?"</p>

<p>"I can smell him," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Ramsgate shivered, looked around the camp. The boys were still
huddled together at a little distance, watching them; but otherwise
everything appeared in order. He looked again at the stranger, a
little more closely this time, and saw that he was fine-looking and
intelligent-appearing. Yet he was certain that the man was crazy,
probably one of those human derelicts who are found occasionally
even in civilized surroundings, wandering naked in the woods. They
are usually called wild-men, but most of them are only harmless
halfwits. However, Ramsgate thought, remembering Burton's lesson,
the best thing to do would be to humor this man and give him
food.</p>

<p>He turned and called to the boys.</p>

<p>"Hurry up with that chuck. We want to get an early start
today."</p>

<p>Several of the whites had been aroused by the noise in the camp
and were straggling from their tents. Gault was among them. He came
over toward the fire, followed by the others.</p>

<p>"What have we here, m'Lord?"</p>

<p>"This poor devil got cold and came in to the fire," said
Ramsgate. "It's perfectly all right, he's welcome. Will you see
that he gets breakfast, Gault?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Gault's meekness surprised Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"And say, Gault, will you have the boys awaken the others? I'd
like to get an early start this morning."</p>

<p>Gault turned toward the boys and called out some instructions in
Swahili. Several of the boys detached themselves and went to the
tents of their masters to awaken them. Tarzan had resumed his place
by the fire, and Ramsgate had gone to talk with the askari who had
been on guard. He had just started to question the man, when he was
interrupted by a shout from the direction of the tents of the
whites and saw Burton's boy running excitedly toward him.</p>

<p>"Come quick, Bwana," shouted the boy. "Come quick!"</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter?" demanded Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"I go in tent. I find Bwana Burton lie on floor, dead!"</p>

<p>Ramsgate dashed for Burton's tent, with Tarzan close at his
elbow. Gault was directly behind them. Burton's body, clad only in
pajamas, lay face down upon the floor. A chair had been upset and
there were other evidences of a fierce struggle. While the three
men were busily examining the body, Romanoff and Trent entered the
tent.</p>

<p>"This is terrible," Romanoff exclaimed, shuddering. "Who could
have done it?"</p>

<p>Trent said nothing. He just stood there, staring down at the
body. Burton had been stabbed in the back, the knife entering under
the left shoulder blade from below and piercing the heart. There
were black and blue marks on his throat, showing that the murderer
had choked him to prevent him from making any outcry.</p>

<p>"Whoever did this must have been a very strong man," said
Romanoff. "Lieutenant Burton was himself very powerful."</p>

<p>Amazed, then, they saw the white stranger take command of the
situation. Tarzan lifted the body to the cot and covered it with a
blanket. Then he bent low and examined the marks on Burton's
throat. He went out and they followed him, mystified and
frightened. As they left the tent, before which practically the
entire safari had congregated, Ramsgate saw his sister coming
toward them from her tent.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked, "What has happened?"</p>

<p>Ramsgate stepped to her side.</p>

<p>"Something pretty terrible has happened, Babs," he said,
avoiding her questioning glance. Then he led her back to her tent
and told her.</p>

<p>Gault gruffly ordered the men back to their duties, summoned all
the askaris who had been on guard during the night and questioned
them. The other whites were gathered around them, but only Tarzan
understood the questions and the answers, which were in Swahili.
There had been four askaris on duty during the night, and all
insisted that they had seen or heard nothing unusual, with the
exception of the last one, who reported that the strange white man
had entered the camp just before dawn to warm himself at the
fire.</p>

<p>"Did you see him all the time he was in camp?" demanded Gault.
The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"The fire hurt my eyes, Bwana, and I closed them. But only for a
moment. All the rest of the time I saw him squatting by the fire,
warming himself."</p>

<p>"You are lying," said Gault. "You were asleep."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I slept a little, Bwana."</p>

<p>"Then this man might have had time to go to the tent and murder
Bwana Burton?" Gault spoke plainly because he did not know that
Tarzan understood Swahili.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana," replied the black. "He might have. I do not know.
But he knew there was a dead man there before anyone else knew
it."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"He told me so, Bwana."</p>

<p>"The man was dead before I came into camp," said Tarzan calmly.
Gault was startled.</p>

<p>"You understand Swahili?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows how long you were in camp. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's all this about?" interrupted Romanoff. "I can't
understand a word. Wait, here comes Lord John. He should carry on
this investigation. Lieutenant Burton was his countryman."</p>

<p>Ramsgate and Romanoff listened intently while Gault repeated
what the askari had told him. Tarzan stood leaning upon his spear,
his face impassive. When Gault had finished, Ramsgate shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I see no reason to suspect this man," he said. "What motive
could he have had? It certainly wasn't robbery, for Burton had
nothing of value. And it couldn't have been revenge, for they
didn't even know each other."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's batty," suggested Smith. "Nobody but a nut would
run around naked in the woods. And you can't never tell what nuts
will do."</p>

<p>Trent nodded. "Dementia praecox," he said, "with homicidal
mania."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara, dry-eyed and composed, came and stood beside her
brother. Violet was with her, red-eyed and sniffling.</p>

<p>"Have you learned anything new?" Lady Barbara asked her
brother.</p>

<p>Ramsgate shook his head.</p>

<p>"Gault thinks this man might have done it."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara looked up.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He says his name is Tarzan. He came into camp sometime during
the night. Nobody seems to know when. But I don't see any reason to
suspect him. He could not possibly have had any motive."</p>

<p>"There are several here who might have had a motive," said Lady
Barbara bitterly. She looked straight at Trent.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" Trent exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You don't think for a moment that I did this?"</p>

<p>"He was ready to kill him once, m'Lord," said Tomlin to
Ramsgate. "I was there, sir. I saw Burton knock him down. They were
quarreling about her Ladyship."</p>

<p>Trent looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"It's preposterous," he protested. "I'll admit I lost my temper,
but after I cooled off I was sorry."</p>

<p>Violet pointed an accusing finger at Godensky.</p>

<p>"He tried to kill him, too! He said he'd kill him. I heard
him."</p>

<p>"As far as that goes, Gault, here, threatened to get him, too,"
said Romanoff. "They didn't all kill him. I think the thing for us
to do is present ourselves to the authorities at Bangali, and let
them thrash the matter out."</p>

<p>"That's all right with me," said Gault. "I didn't kill him, and
I don't know that this fellow did. But it's certainly mighty funny
that he was the only one in camp to know that Lieutenant Burton was
dead."</p>

<p>"There was another who knew," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" demanded Gault.</p>

<p>"The man who killed him."</p>

<p>"I'd still like to know how you knew he was dead," said
Gault.</p>

<p>"So should I," said Ramsgate. "I must say that that looks a
little suspicious."</p>

<p>"It's quite simple," said Tarzan, "but I'm afraid none of you
would understand. I am Tarzan of the Apes. I have lived here nearly
all my life under precisely the same conditions as the other
animals. Animals are dependent upon certain senses much more than
are civilized man. The hearing of some of them is exceptionally
keen. The eyesight of others is remarkable. But the best developed
of all is the sense of smell.</p>

<p>"Without at least one of these senses highly developed, one
couldn't survive for long. Man, being naturally among the most
helpless of animals, I was compelled to develop them all. Death has
its own peculiar odor. It is noticeable almost immediately after
life has ceased. While I was warming myself at the fire and talking
to the askari, the wind freshened and changed. It brought to my
nostrils the evidence that a dead man lay a short distance away,
probably in one of the tents."</p>

<p>"Nuts," said Smith disgustedly.</p>

<p>Godensky laughed nervously. "He must think we're crazy, too, to
believe a story like that."</p>

<p>"I think we've got our man all right," said Trent. "A maniac
doesn't have to have a motive for killing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent's right," agreed Gault. "We'd better tie him up and
take him along to Bangali with us."</p>

<p>None of these men knew Tarzan. None of them could interpret the
strange look that came suddenly into his gray eyes. As Gault moved
toward him, Tarzan backed away.</p>

<p>Then Trent drew his pistol and covered him.</p>

<p>"Make a false move and I'll kill you," Trent said.</p>

<p>Trent's intentions may have been of the best, but his technique
was faulty. He was guilty, among others, of two cardinal errors. He
was too close to Tarzan, and he did not shoot the instant that he
drew his gun. Tarzan's hand shot out and seized his wrist. Trent
pulled the trigger, but the bullet plowed harmlessly into the
ground. Then he cried out in anguish and dropped the weapon when
the ape-man applied more pressure.</p>

<p>It was all done very quickly, and then Tarzan was backing away
from them holding Trent as a shield in front of him. They dared not
shoot for fear of hitting Trent. Gault and Ramsgate started
forward. Tarzan, holding the man with one hand, drew his hunting
knife.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," he said, "or I kill."</p>

<p>His tone was quiet and level, but it had the cutting edge of a
keen knife. The two men stopped, and then Tarzan backed away toward
the forest that came down to the edge of the camp.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to do something?" shouted Trent. "Are you
going to let this maniac carry me off into the woods and butcher
me?"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried Romanoff to no one in particular.</p>

<p>"We can't do anything," said Ramsgate. "If we go after him,
he'll surely kill Trent. If we don't, he may let him go."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to go after them," said Gault, but no one
volunteered, and a moment later Tarzan disappeared into the forest
dragging Trent with him....</p>

<p>The safari did not get an early start that morning, and long
before they got under way Trent came out of the forest and rejoined
them. He was still trembling from fear.</p>

<p>"Give me a spot of brandy, John," he said to Ramsgate. "I think
that demon broke my wrist. God, I'm about done up. That fellow's
not human. He handled me as though I were a baby. When he was sure
no one was following us, he let me go. And then he took to the
trees just like a monkey. I tell you, it's uncanny."</p>

<p>"Did he harm you in any way after he took you out of camp?"
Ramsgate wanted to know.</p>

<p>"No. He just dragged me along. He never spoke once, never said a
word. It was like&mdash;why, it was like being dragged off by a
lion."</p>

<p>"I hope we've seen the last of him," said Ramsgate
hopefully.</p>

<p>"Well, there's not much doubt about that," replied Trent. "He
killed poor Burton, all right, and he's made a clean getaway."</p>

<p>The safari moved slowly, four carriers bearing the body of
Burton on an improvised stretcher. It brought up the rear of the
column, and Barbara walked ahead with her brother so she would not
have to see it.</p>

<p>They did not reach Bangali that day, and had to make another
camp. Everyone was depressed. There was no laughing or singing
among the native boys, and very shortly after the evening meal
everyone turned in for the night.</p>

<p>About midnight the camp was aroused by wild shouting and a shot.
Then Smith came running from the tent he shared with Peterson.
Ramsgate leaped from his cot and ran out into the open in his
pajamas, almost colliding with Smith.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, man? For God's sake, what's happened?"</p>

<p>"That crazy giant," cried Smith. "He was here again. He killed
poor Peterson this time. I shot at him. I think I hit him, but I
don't know. I couldn't be sure."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" snapped Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"Off there, into the jungle," panted Smith, pointing.</p>

<p>Ramsgate shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's no use following," he said. "We could never find
him."</p>

<p>They went into Peterson's tent and found him lying on his cot,
stabbed through the heart while he slept. There was no more sleep
in camp that night and the whites as well as the askaris stood
guard.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="S2-7" name="S2-7"></a>VII. &mdash; MURDER WILL OUT</h2>

<p class="first">IN Bangali, Tarzan sat in the bungalow of Col.
Gerald Giles-Burton.</p>

<p>"The shock of your news was not as great as it might have been,"
said Colonel Burton. "I'd given my boy up for dead a long while
ago. Yet, to know that he was alive all the time, and almost
here&mdash;that's what is hard to bear. Did they have any idea who
killed him?"</p>

<p>"They're all pretty sure I did it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Burton.</p>

<p>"There are three men in the safari he had trouble with. They all
threatened to get him. But from what I heard, the threats were all
made in the heat of anger, and probably didn't mean anything. Only
one of them might have thought he had reason to kill."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"A chap by the name of Trent, who was in love with Lady Barbara.
That was the only real motive, so far as I could learn."</p>

<p>"Sometimes a very strong motive," said Burton.</p>

<p>"However," continued Tarzan, "Trent didn't kill your son. He
couldn't have. If the murderer was in camp, I could have found him
if they hadn't run me out."</p>

<p>"Will you remain here and help me find him when the safari gets
in?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You didn't need to ask."</p>

<p>"There is something else I think you ought to know. At the time
that he was lost, my son was carrying some very important papers
for the Government. He was ostensibly flying from London to
Capetown, but his instructions were to stop here and leave the
papers with me."</p>

<p>"And he was being pursued by three men in an Italian military
plane," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Gad, man! How did you know that?" demanded Burton.</p>

<p>"I ran across both planes. Your son's plane was shot down, but
he had bailed out safely. I found his parachute near the plane. But
before he bailed out, he shot the pilot of the other plane. The
fellow brought his plane down safely before he died. I found him
still sitting at the controls. The two men with him got out all
right. One of them may have been hurt a little, for I noticed that
he limped, but he might have been lame before. That, of course, I
do not know."</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"No. I followed their tracks for a little way until I came
across your son's ship. Then, knowing he was an Englishman, or
believing so because he was piloting an English plane, I started
off after him. You see, he had landed in lion country. You know,
the Buiroo country."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the Buiroos are worse than the lions."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan, reminiscing, "I've had business with them
before. They nearly put an end to me this time. After I got away
from them I started for Bangali again, and early this morning I
stumbled onto this safari."</p>

<p>"Do you think those two men had a chance to get the papers away
from my son?"</p>

<p>"No. They were following different trails. They are probably
both dead by this time. It's bad country where they came down. They
were a couple of Italians, I suppose."</p>

<p>Colonel Burton shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. One was an American and the other was a Russian. Their
names were Campbell and Zubanev. I got a full report on them from
London. They were wanted for espionage and murder back there."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think they'll bother anyone again," said Tarzan.
"And in the morning you'll have the papers."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll have the papers," said Burton sadly. "It is strange,
Tarzan, how little we appreciate happiness until we lose it. I'm
not vindictive, but I'd like to know who killed my son."</p>

<p>"Africa is a large place, Burton," said the ape-man, "but if the
man who murdered your boy is still alive, I'll get him before he
gets out of Africa. I promise you that."</p>

<p>"If you can't find him, no one can," said Burton. "Thanks,
Tarzan."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook Burton's hand warmly.</p>

<p>Eight stretcher bearers, carrying the bodies of Cecil Burton and
Peterson brought up the rear of the safari as it halted just on the
outskirts of Bangali and prepared to go into camp. Ramsgate and
Romanoff went immediately to report to Colonel Burton. They found
him sitting in his office, a screened veranda along one side of his
bungalow. He stood up as they entered and held out his hand to the
young Englishman.</p>

<p>"Lord John Ramsgate, I presume," he said, then turning to the
Russian, "and Mr. Romanoff. I have been expecting you
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"We come on a very sad mission, Colonel Burton," said Ramsgate,
a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Burton.</p>

<p>Ramsgate and Romanoff looked astonished.</p>

<p>"You know!" exclaimed Romanoff.</p>

<p>"Yes. Word was brought to me last night."</p>

<p>"But that is impossible," said Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"We must be referring to different things."</p>

<p>"No. We are both referring to the murder of my son."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" exclaimed Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"I don't understand. But Colonel, we are pretty sure now that we
know who the murderer is. Last night there was another similar
murder committed in our camp, and one of the members of our safari
saw the murderer in the act of committing the crime. He fired at
him, and thinks that he hit him."</p>

<p>At this moment the door of the bungalow opened and Tarzan
stepped suddenly out onto the veranda!</p>

<p>Ramsgate and Romanoff both leaped to their feet.</p>

<p>"There's the man! There's the murderer!" cried Ramsgate.</p>

<p>Colonel Burton shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, gentlemen," he said quietly. "Tarzan of the Apes would not
have murdered my son, and he could not have murdered the other man
because he was here in my bungalow all last night!"</p>

<p>"But," said Romanoff, "Smith said that he saw this man and
recognized him when Peterson was murdered last night."</p>

<p>"Well, in a moment of excitement like that," said Burton, "and
in the darkness, a man might easily make a mistake. Suppose we go
to your camp and question some of the people involved. I understand
that three of them had either attacked or threatened my son."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ramsgate. "Both my sister and I wish a most thorough
investigation be made, and I am sure that Mr. Romanoff feels as we
do about it."</p>

<p>Romanoff inclined his head in assent.</p>

<p>"You will come with us, of course, Tarzan?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"If you wish," Tarzan replied.</p>

<p>It was with mixed emotions that the members of the safari saw
Tarzan enter the camp with Ramsgate, Romanoff and Colonel Burton,
and a detail of native constabulary.</p>

<p>"They got him," said Gault to Trent. "That was quick work."</p>

<p>"They ought to handcuff him," said Trent, "or he'll get away
just as he did before. They haven't even taken his weapons away
from him."</p>

<p>At Colonel Burton's suggestion all the whites in the party were
gathered together for questioning. While they were being summoned
Tarzan carefully examined the body of Peterson. He looked
particularly at the man's hands and feet. Then he scrutinized the
wound over the heart. Just for a moment he bent low over the body,
his face close to the sleeve of the man's tunic. Then he returned
to where the company was gathered in front of Colonel Burton.</p>

<p>One by one, the English official questioned them. He listened
intently to the evidence of Violet, Tomlin and Lady Barbara. He
questioned Godensky, Gault and Trent. He questioned Smith about the
murderer of Peterson.</p>

<p>"I understand that you said you saw this man kill Peterson." He
indicated Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I thought it was him," said Smith, "but I might have been
mistaken. It was very dark."</p>

<p>"Well, now, as to my son," said Burton. "Is there anyone here
who cares to make a direct charge of murder against any
individual?"</p>

<p>Lady Barbara Ramsgate stiffened.</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel," she said. "I charge Duncan Trent with the murder
of Cecil Giles-Burton."</p>

<p>Trent paled considerably, but did not speak. All eyes were
turned upon him. Tarzan bent close and whispered something in
Burton's ear. The latter nodded.</p>

<p>"Tarzan wishes to ask a few questions," said Burton. "You will
please answer them as you would if I asked them."</p>

<p>"May I see your knife?" asked Tarzan, pointing at Pierre.</p>

<p>"I do not carry one, sir."</p>

<p>"And yours?" He indicated Gault.</p>

<p>Gault withdrew his knife from its scabbard and handed it to the
ape-man, who examined it for a moment and then returned it. Then he
asked for Tomlin's knife; but Tomlin did not carry one.</p>

<p>In rapid succession he asked for and examined the knives of
Smith, Godensky, and Trent. Then he turned to Smith.</p>

<p>"Smith," he said, "you were in the tent after Peterson was
murdered. Can you tell me how he was lying on his cot?"</p>

<p>"He was lying flat on his back," Smith said.</p>

<p>"Which side of his cot was against the side of the tent?"</p>

<p>"The left side."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"How long have you known this man Smith?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A few weeks only," replied Ramsgate. "We found him and Peterson
wandering around lost. They said their boys had deserted them."</p>

<p>"He was limping when you found him, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>John Ramsgate looked his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "He told us he had sprained his ankle."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" demanded Smith. "Didn't I tell
you the guy's a nut?"</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped close to Smith.</p>

<p>"Let me have your gun," he said.</p>

<p>"I ain't got no gun," growled Smith.</p>

<p>"What is that bulge underneath the left side of your shirt?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Tarzan placed his hand quickly over the spot.</p>

<p>Smith grinned.</p>

<p>"You ain't as smart as you think you are," he said.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Lady Barbara.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent did not kill Burton," he said with great conviction.
"Smith killed him. Smith killed Peterson, too."</p>

<p>"It's a damn lie!" cried Smith. "You killed 'em yourself! I'm
being framed! Can't you all see it?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think Smith is the murderer?" asked Colonel
Burton.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll make one change in my statement," said Tarzan. "It
was Campbell who killed them. This man's name is not Smith. It is
Campbell. The real name of the man he killed last night was not
Peterson, but Zubanev!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it's a damned lie!" shouted Smith. "You ain't got
nothin' on me! You can't prove nothin'!"</p>

<p>Tarzan towered over the rest of the company. A hush fell over
the group. Even Smith was silent.</p>

<p>"A very powerful, left-handed man with the second finger of his
right hand missing killed Lieutenant Burton," Tarzan said. "The
wound which killed Burton could only have been inflicted if the
knife were held in the left hand. On his throat were the imprints
of a thumb, a first, third, and little finger.</p>

<p>"You will notice that the second finger of Smith's, or rather
Campbell's right hand is missing. Also I noticed that when I asked
the men to hand me their knives, Campbell was the only man who
passed the weapon to me with his left hand. The knife wound in
Zubanev's chest was made by a knife held in a left hand."</p>

<p>"But the motive for these murders," exclaimed Romanoff.</p>

<p>"Colonel Burton will find them inside of Campbell's shirt! They
are the papers that Lieutenant Burton was carrying when he was shot
down by the pursuing plane that carried Campbell and Zubanev. I
know that Peterson, or rather Zubanev, was on that plane. The other
man with him limped when he walked away from the plane. That man
was Campbell, who calls himself Smith."</p>

<p>"But why did Smith or Campbell, or whatever his name is, want to
kill Burton and Peterson?" asked John Ramsgate.</p>

<p>"He and Zubanev wanted the papers that Burton carried," Tarzan
explained. "No one else knew about the papers. Campbell knew that
if he stole the papers and let Burton live, the latter would
immediately launch an intensive search through the safari for them.
He had to kill Burton. He killed Zubanev so that he would not have
to share with him the money that he expected to get for the papers,
which they had already tentatively sold to the Italian Government.
Here"&mdash;Tarzan ripped open Campbell's shirt&mdash;"are the
papers!"</p>

<p>The native constabulary dragged Joseph Campbell, alias Joe the
Pooch, away.</p>

<p>"How did you know that Zubanev was on that Italian plane?"
Ramsgate asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I found his glove in the rear cockpit," replied the ape-man.
Ramsgate shook his head in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I still don't understand," he said. Tarzan smiled.</p>

<p>"That is because you are a civilized man," he said. "Numa, the
Lion, or Sheeta, the Leopard, would understand. When I found that
glove I took its scent. Therefore I carried in my memory the smell
of Zubanev. Then when I smelled Peterson, I knew he was Zubanev.
Hence, Smith must be Campbell. And now&mdash;" Tarzan paused, swept
them with his glance. "I am going home," he said. "Goodbye, my
friends. It was good to see some of my own people again, but the
call of the jungle is stronger. Goodbye..."</p>

<p>And Tarzan of the Apes returned to the jungle.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-1" id="S3-1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT is sometimes difficult to know just where to
begin a story. I recall an acquaintance of mine who, in telling of
an accident wherein a neighbor had fallen down the cellar stairs
and broken her leg, would recount all the marriages and deaths in
the family for a generation or two back before getting to the point
of the story.</p>

<p>In the present instance, I might go back to Ah Cuitok Tutul Xiu,
the Mayan, who founded Uxmal in Yucatan in 1004 A.D.; and from him
on to Chab Xib Chac, the Red Man, who destroyed Mayapan in 1451 and
murdered the entire Cocom family of tyrants; but I shall not. I
shall simply mention that Chac Tutul Xiu, a descendant of Ah Cuitok
Tutul Xiu, motivated by that strange migratory urge of the Maya and
by the advice of the Ah Kin Mai, or chief priest, left Uxmal with
many of his followers, nobles, warriors, women, and slaves, and
went to the coast where he constructed several large double dugout
canoes and embarked therein upon the broad Pacific, never again to
be heard of in his homeland.</p>

<p>That was in 1452 or 1453. From there I might make a broad
calendric jump of some four hundred eighty-five or six years to
modern times and to the island of Uxmal in the South Pacific, where
Cit Coh Xiu is king; but I shall not do that either, since it would
be anticipating my story.</p>

<p>Instead, I take you to the deck of the Saigon, a battered old
tramp steamer awaiting at Mombasa to load wild animals for shipment
to the United States. From below and from cages on deck come the
plaints and threats of captured beasts; the deep-throated rumblings
of lions, the trumpeting of elephants, the obscene "laugh" of
hyenas, the chattering of monkeys.</p>

<p>At the rail two men are deep in argument: "But I tell you,
Abdullah," one was saying, "we are practically ready to sail; the
last consignment should be here within the week, and every day my
expenses are mounting. It might take you a month to bring him in;
you might not get him at all."</p>

<p>"I cannot fail, Sahib Krause," replied Abdullah Abu Nejm. "He
has received an injury; that I know from Ndalo, in whose country he
now is; and so he may be taken easily. Think of it, Sahib! A real
wild-man, raised by apes from infancy, the play fellow of
elephants, the killer of lions. Wellah? he would be worth more than
all your shipload of wild beasts in the land of the Nasara; he
would make you a rich man, Sahib Krause."</p>

<p>"As I understand it, the fellow speaks English as well as the
damned British themselves; I have heard of him for years. How long
do you suppose I could exhibit in a cage in the United States a
white man who can speak English? Abdullah, you are always saying
that we Nasara are mad; I think it is you who are mad."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," replied the Arab. "This injury which he
has suffered had deprived him of speech and the knowledge of
speech; in that respect, he would be as your other beasts. They
cannot complain, so that anyone can understand them; neither could
he."</p>

<p>"Aphasia," muttered Krause.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Sahib?"</p>

<p>"That is the name of the affliction which has resulted in your
man's loss of speech," explained Krause; "It is caused by a brain
lesion. It puts a different aspect on the matter; the thing might
be done&mdash;and very profitably; but yet&mdash;" He
hesitated.</p>

<p>"You do not like the English, Sahib?" inquired Abdullah.</p>

<p>"I do not," snapped Krause. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"This man is an Englishman," replied the Arab in his oiliest
tones.</p>

<p>"What would you want for bringing him in?"</p>

<p>"The expenses of my safari, which would be very little, and the
price of one lion."</p>

<p>"You do not ask much for so great a catch," commented Krause;
"why is that? I expected you to rob me&mdash;as usual."</p>

<p>The Arab's eyes narrowed, and his sinister face seemed a mask of
hate. "He is my enemy," he said.</p>

<p>"How long will it take?"</p>

<p>"Less than a month," replied Abdullah.</p>

<p>"I shall wait thirty days," said Krause; "then I shall sail,
whether you are back or not."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"I AM bored," said the girl. "Mombasa! I hate
it."</p>

<p>"You are always complaining," growled Krause; "I don't know why
the devil I brought you along; anyway, we sail in three days,
whether that Arab dog is back or not; then I suppose you'll find
something else to grouse about."</p>

<p>"It must be a very valuable specimen Abdullah is bringing you,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"What is it, Fritz&mdash;a pink elephant or a crimson lion?"</p>

<p>"It is a wild man, but keep it to yourself&mdash;the English
pigs would never let me take him aboard, if they knew."</p>

<p>"A wild man! One of those whose heads come up to a little point
on top, like a cone? He should have a little tuft of hair right on
the tip top of the cone, and his nose should spread all across his
face, and he shouldn't have any chin. Is he like that, Fritz?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen him, but I suppose he is just like
that&mdash;that has been orthodox ever since Barnum's
What-is-it."</p>

<p>"Look, Fritz! Here comes Abdullah now."</p>

<p>The swart Arab came over the side and approached them; his face
betokened nothing of either the success or failure of his
mission.</p>

<p>"Marhaba!" Krause greeted him. "Ey khabar."</p>

<p>"The best of tidings, Sahib," replied Abdullah. "I have him,
just outside of town, in a wooden cage covered with matting, so
that none may see what is within; but billah! what a time we had in
capturing him! We took him in a net, but he killed three of Ndalo's
warriors before they could tie his hands behind him. He is strong
as a lion. We have had to keep his hands tied ever since we got
him: he would have torn that wooden cage to pieces in an instant,
had we not."</p>

<p>"I have an iron cage that he cannot tear to pieces," said
Krause.</p>

<p>"I would not be too sure of that," cautioned the Arab. "If your
cage could not withstand the strength of a lion, you had still
better keep his hands tied."</p>

<p>"My cage would not hold an elephant," said Krause, "but if it
could, it would be strong enough."</p>

<p>"I would still keep his hands tied," persisted Abdullah.</p>

<p>"Has he spoken?" asked Krause.</p>

<p>"No; not a word&mdash;he just sits and looks. There is neither
hate nor fear in his eyes&mdash;he reminds me of el adrea; I am
always expecting to hear him roar. We have to feed him by hand, and
when he eats his meat, he growls like el adrea."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Krause. "He will be a sensation. I can
just see those fool Americans begging to pay good money to see him.
Now listen&mdash;I shall clear this afternoon and stand up the
coast, returning after dark. Load the cage on a dhow below the town
and stand straight out until you pick up my signal&mdash;I'll blink
my running light three times in rapid succession at intervals; then
you show a light. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"It is already done," said Abdullah Abu Nejm.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE wind had risen and a sea was running when
Abdullah picked up the Saigon's signal. Maneuvering the dhow into
position along the lee side of the steamer was finally
accomplished. Tackle was lowered and made fast to the cage
containing the wild man. Abdullah was guiding the cage as it was
hoisted from the dhow, when suddenly the Saigon rolled over away
from the smaller craft; the cage was jerked suddenly upward; and
Abdullah, fearing that he would be hurled into the sea, clung to
it. The cage crashed against the side of the steamer; the men above
continued to hoist; then the Saigon rolled back and crashed down
upon the dhow, swamping it.</p>

<p>All of the crew of the dhow were lost, and Abdullah was aboard
the steamer bound for America. He filled the air with "billahs!"
and "Wellah-billahs!" and called upon Allah to preserve him.</p>

<p>"You're damn lucky to be alive," Krause told him. "You'll make a
lot of money in America. I'll exhibit you, too, as the sheik who
captured the wild man; they'll pay plenty to see a real sheik
straight from the desert. I'll buy a camel for you, and you can
ride through the streets with a banner advertising the show."</p>

<p>"I, Abdullah Abu Nejm, exhibited like a wild beast!" screamed
the Arab. "Never!"</p>

<p>Krause shrugged. "Have it your own way," he said; "but don't
forget, you got to eat, and you won't find many free date trees in
America. I'll feed you until we get there, but after that you're on
your own."</p>

<p>"Dog of a Nasrany!" muttered the Arab.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-2" id="S3-2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning was fair, with a brisk wind,
as the Saigon steamed northeastward across the Indian Ocean. The
animals on deck were quiet. A wooden cage, entirely covered with
matting, was lashed down amidships. No sound came from it,
either.</p>

<p>Janette Laon followed Krause on deck; her black hair was blowing
in the wind, which pressed her light dress against her, revealing a
figure of exceptional allure. Wilhelm Schmidt, the 2nd mate of the
Saigon, leaning with his back against the rail, watched her through
half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Now may I see your wild man, Fritz?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I hope he's still alive," said the man; "he must have got an
awful beating when we hauled him aboard last night."</p>

<p>"Haven't you tried to find out?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Couldn't have done anything for him, anyway," replied Krause.
"From what Abdullah told me, he'd be a mean customer to handle.
Come on; we'll have a look at him. Hey, you!" he called to a Lascar
sailor; "take the matting off that cage."</p>

<p>As they watched the man at work, Schmidt came over and joined
them. "What you got in there, Mr. Krause?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A wild man; ever see one?"</p>

<p>"I saw a Frenchie once, whose wife had run off with the
chauffeur," said Schmidt; "he sure was a wild man."</p>

<p>The sailor had removed the lashings, and now he dragged away the
matting. Inside the cage, a giant figure squatted on his haunches,
appraising them with level gaze.</p>

<p>"Why, he's a white man!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"So he is," said Krause.</p>

<p>"You going to keep a man penned up in a cage like a beast?"
asked Schmidt.</p>

<p>"He's only white on the outside," said Krause&mdash;"he's an
Englishman."</p>

<p>Schmidt spat into the cage. The girl stamped her foot angrily.
"Don't ever do that again," she said.</p>

<p>"What's he to you?" demanded Krause. "Didn't you hear me say
he's nothing but a dirty English pig."</p>

<p>"He's a human being and a white man," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"He's a dummy," retorted Krause; "can't speak a word nor
understand one. It's an honor for him to be spit on by a
German."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, don't let Schmidt do it again."</p>

<p>The ship's bell sounded, and Schmidt went to relieve the 1st
mate on the bridge.</p>

<p>"He's the pig," said the girl, looking after Schmidt.</p>

<p>The two stood looking at the wild man as Hans de Groote came
down from the bridge and joined them. The Dutchman was a good
looking young fellow in his early twenties; he had been signed on
as 1st mate at Batavia on the trip out, after his predecessor had
mysteriously "fallen overboard." Schmidt, who thought that he
should have had the assignment, hated him and made no effort to
conceal the fact. That there was bad blood between them was nothing
to cause comment aboard the Saigon, for bad blood was the rule
rather than the exception.</p>

<p>Larsen, the captain, who was now confined to his cabin with a
bad attack of fever, was not on speaking terms with Krause, who had
chartered the ship; while the crew, made up principally of Lascars
and Chinese, were always on the verge of knifing one another. On
the whole, the captive beasts were the most admirable creatures
aboard.</p>

<p>De Groote stood looking at the man in the cage for several
seconds before he spoke. His reaction was almost identical with
that of the girl and Schmidt. "He's a white man!" he exclaimed.
"You're certainly not going to keep him in a cage like a wild
beast!"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm going to do," snapped Krause, "and it's
none of your damned business, nor anyone else's," and he shot a
scowling glance at the girl.</p>

<p>"He's your wild man," said de Groote, "but at least free his
hands; it's unnecessary cruelty to keep him tied up like that."</p>

<p>"I'm going to free his hands," said Krause, grudgingly, "as soon
as I can get an iron cage up from below; it would be too much of a
job feeding him this way."</p>

<p>"He's had nothing to eat or drink since yesterday," said the
girl. "I don't care what he is, Fritz; I wouldn't treat a dog the
way you're treating this poor man."</p>

<p>"Neither would I," retorted Krause.</p>

<p>"He is less than a dog," said a voice behind them. It was the
voice of Abdullah Abu Nejm. He came close to the cage and spat on
the man within, and the girl slapped Abdullah Abu Nejm across the
face with all her strength. The Arab's hand flew to his dagger, but
de Groote stepped between the two and seized the man's wrist.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have done that, Janette," said Krause.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were flashing fire, and the blood had left her
face. "I'll not stand by and see him insult that man," she said;
"and that goes for the rest of you, too," and she looked straight
into Krause's eyes.</p>

<p>"And I'll back her up," said de Groote. "Maybe it's none of my
business if you keep him in a cage, but I'll make it some of my
business if you don't treat him decently. Have you ordered the iron
cage up yet?"</p>

<p>"I'll treat him as I please," said Krause; "and what are you
going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I'll beat hell out of you," replied de Groote, "and then turn
you in to the authorities at the first port of call."</p>

<p>"Here comes the iron cage now," said Janette. "Get him into it
and take those cords off his wrists."</p>

<p>Krause was frightened at de Groote's threat to notify the
authorities; that made him squirm. "Oh, come," he said in
mollifying tones, "I'm going to treat him all right. I got a lot of
money tied up in him and I expect to make a lot out of him; I'd be
a fool not to treat him well."</p>

<p>"See that you do," said de Groote.</p>

<p>A big iron cage was swung up from below and placed close to the
wooden cage, the two doors close together. Krause drew a revolver;
then both doors were raised. The man in the wooden cage did not
move.</p>

<p>"Get in there, you dumb idiot!" yelled Krause, pointing the
revolver at the man. He did not even look at Krause. "Get a capstan
bar, one of you men," directed Krause, "and poke him from
behind."</p>

<p>"Wait," said the girl; "let me try." She walked to the opposite
side of the iron cage and beckoned to the captive. He just looked
at her. "Come here a minute," she said to de Groote; "let me take
your knife; now place your wrists together, as though they were
bound; yes, that's it." She took the knife and pretended to sever
imaginary cords about de Groote's wrists; then she beckoned again
to the man in the wooden cage. He arose, but still stooped, as he
could not stand erect in the small wooden cage, and walked into the
larger cage.</p>

<p>The girl was standing close to the bars, the knife in her hand;
a sailor dropped the door of the iron cage; the captive approached
the girl and, turning his back toward her, pressed his wrists
against the bars.</p>

<p>"You said he was stupid," Janette said to Krause; "he's not
stupid; I could tell that by just looking at him." She cut the
bonds from his wrists, which were discolored and swollen. The man
turned and looked at her. He said nothing, but his eyes seemed to
thank her.</p>

<p>De Groote was standing beside Janette. "He's a fine-looking
specimen, isn't he?" he said.</p>

<p>"And handsome," said the girl. She turned to Krause. "Have some
water and food brought," she directed.</p>

<p>"You going to be his nurse maid?" inquired Krause with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see that he's treated decently," she replied.
"What does he eat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Krause. "What does he eat,
Abdullah?"</p>

<p>"The dog has not eaten for two days," replied the Arab; "so I
guess he will eat almost anything. In the jungle he eats raw meat
from his kills, like a beast."</p>

<p>"We'll try him on some," said Krause; "it will be a good way of
getting rid of any of the animals that die." He sent a sailor to
the galley for meat and water.</p>

<p>The man in the iron cage looked long at Abdullah Abu Nejm; so
long that the Arab spat on the deck and turned away.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes if he ever got out of that
cage," said Krause.</p>

<p>"You should not have freed his hands," said Abdullah; "he is
more dangerous than the lion."</p>

<p>When the sailor returned with the meat and water, Janette took
them from him and passed them in to the wild man. He took a small
swallow of water; then he went into a far corner of his cage,
squatted on his haunches, and tore at the meat with his strong,
white teeth; and as he ate, he growled.</p>

<p>The girl shuddered, and the men moved about uneasily. "El adrea
of the broad head eats thus," said Abdullah.</p>

<p>"He sounds like a lion," said Krause. "By what name do the
natives know him, Abdullah?"</p>

<p>"He is called Tarzan of the Apes," replied the Arab.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-3" id="S3-3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Saigon crossed the Indian Ocean to Sumatra,
where Krause took on two elephants, a rhinoceros, three orangutans,
two tigers, a panther, and a tapir. Fearing that de Groote would
make good his threat to report the human captive to the authorities
at Batavia, Krause did not put in there as he had intended; but
continued on to Singapore for monkeys, another tiger, and several
boa constrictors; then the Saigon steamed across the South China
Sea toward Manila, its last port of call on the long drag to the
Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Krause was delighted; so far all his plans had worked out
splendidly; and if he got his cargo to New York, he stood to clean
up an excellent profit. Perhaps he would not have been so delighted
had he known of all that went on aboard the Saigon. Larsen was
still confined to his cabin, and while de Groote was a good
officer, he was young, and new aboard the ship. Like Krause, he did
not know all that was talked of in the forecastle and on deck at
night when it was Schmidt's watch. At such times, the 2nd mate
spoke long and earnestly with Jabu Singh, the Lascar; and he spoke
in whispers. Afterward, Jabu Singh spoke long and earnestly with
the other Lascars in the forecastle.</p>

<p>"But the wild beasts?" asked Chand of his fellow Lascar, Jabu
Singh; "what of them?"</p>

<p>"Schmidt says we throw them overboard along with de Groote,
Krause, and the others."</p>

<p>"They are worth much money," objected Chand; "we should keep
them and sell them."</p>

<p>"We would be caught and hanged," said another Lascar.</p>

<p>"No," Jabu Singh contradicted. "While we were in Singapore,
Schmidt learned that Germany and England have gone to war. This is
an English ship; Schmidt says that a German has a right to capture
it. He says we would get prize money; but he thinks the animals
would be valueless, and they are a nuisance."</p>

<p>"I know a man on the island of Illili who would buy them," said
Chand. "We will not let Schmidt throw them overboard."</p>

<p>The men spoke in their native dialect, confident that the
Chinese sailors would not understand them; but in that they were
wrong; Lum Kip had once sailed the China Sea aboard a felucca that
had been captained and manned by Lascars, and he had learned their
language. He had also learned to hate Lascars, as he had been
treated very badly aboard the felucca and had been given no share
of the spoils of their nefarious operations. But Lum Kip's face
gave no indication that he understood what he overheard; it wore
its usual expression of profound detachment, as he puffed on his
long pipe with its little brass bowl.</p>

<p>The man in the large iron cage on deck often paced back and
forth for hours at a time. Often he leaped and seized the bars at
the top of the cage and swung to and fro from one end of the cage
to the other, hand over hand. When anyone approached his cage, he
would stop; for he was not doing these things for his amusement,
nor for the amusement of others, but to keep his magnificent
physique from deteriorating during his confinement.</p>

<p>Janette Laon came often to his cage; she saw that he was fed
regularly and that he always had water; and she tried to teach him
her native language, French; but in this she made no headway.
Tarzan knew what was the matter with him; and while he could
neither speak nor understand speech, his thoughts were as coherent
and intelligent as ever. He wondered if he would ever recover; but
he was not greatly troubled because he could not converse with
human beings; the thing that annoyed him most was that he could no
longer communicate with manu, the monkey, or the mangani, the great
apes, with which he classed the orangutans that were aboard and
confined in cages near his. Seeing the cargo that the Saigon
carried, he knew the life that lay in store for him; but he also
knew that sooner or later he would escape. He thought of that most
often when he saw Abdullah Abu Nejm on deck.</p>

<p>He had tested the bars of his cage at night when nobody was
near; and he was confident that he could spread them sufficiently
to allow his body to pass between them; but he guessed that were he
to do so, while at sea, he would only be shot down; for he knew
that they feared him. With the patience of a wild beast he bided
his time.</p>

<p>When Abdullah Abu Nejm or Schmidt were on deck, his eyes
followed them; for these two had spat at him. Abdullah Abu Nejm had
reason to hate him, for Tarzan had ended his lucrative career as a
slave trader and ivory poacher; but the 2nd mate had been motivated
only by the natural reactions of a bully and a coward who discovers
one whom he considers his racial enemy powerless to retaliate.</p>

<p>Abdullah Abu Nejm, hating Krause and the girl and ignored by de
Groote, consorted much with Schmidt, until the two men, finding
much in common, became boon companions. Abdullah, glad of any
opportunity to wreak vengeance on Krause, willingly agreed to aid
Schmidt in the venture the 2nd mate was planning.</p>

<p>"The Lascars are with me to a man," Schmidt told Abdullah, "but
we haven't approached the chinks; there's bad blood between them
and the Lascars on this ship, and Jabu Singh says his men won't
play if the chinks are to be in on it and get a cut."</p>

<p>"There are not many," said Abdullah, "If they make trouble,
they, too, can go overboard."</p>

<p>"The trouble is, we need 'em to man the ship," explained
Schmidt; "and about throwing 'em overboard; I've changed my mind;
there ain't anybody going overboard. They're all going to be
prisoners of war; then, if anything goes wrong, there's no murder
charge against us."</p>

<p>"You can run the ship without Larsen and de Groote?" asked the
Arab.</p>

<p>"Sure I can," replied Schmidt. "I've got Oubanovitch on my side.
Being a Red Russian, he hates Krause; he hates everybody who has a
pfennig more than he. I'm making him 1st mate, but he'll have to
keep on running the engine room too. Jabu Singh will be 2nd mate.
Oh, I've got everything worked out."</p>

<p>"And you are to be captain?" inquired the Arab.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And what am I to be?"</p>

<p>"You? Oh, hell, you can be admiral."</p>

<p>That afternoon Lum Kip approached de Groote. "Maybe-so you make
dead tonight," said Lum Kip in a low whisper.</p>

<p>"What you driving at, Lum?" demanded de Groote.</p>

<p>"You savvy Schmidt?"</p>

<p>"Of course; what about him?"</p>

<p>"Tonight he takee ship; Lascars, they takee ship; 'banovitchee,
he takee ship; man in long, white dless, he takee ship. They killee
Larsen; killee you; killee Klause; killee evlybody. Chinee boy no
takee ship; no killee. You savvy?"</p>

<p>"You having a pipe dream, Lum?" demanded de Groote.</p>

<p>"No pipe dleam; you waitee see."</p>

<p>"How about Chinee boys?" asked de Groote, who was now thoroughly
worried.</p>

<p>"They no killee you."</p>

<p>"Will they fight Lascar boys?"</p>

<p>"You betee; you give 'em gun."</p>

<p>"No have gun," said de Groote; "tell 'em get capstan bars,
belaying pins, knives. You savvy?"</p>

<p>"Me savvy."</p>

<p>"And when the trouble starts, you boys light into the
Lascars."</p>

<p>"You betee."</p>

<p>"And thank you, Lum; I'll not forget this."</p>

<p>De Groote went at once to Larsen, but found him rolling on his
bunk, delirious with fever; then he went to Krause's cabin, where
he found Krause and Janette Laon and explained the situation to
them.</p>

<p>"Do you believe the Chink?" asked Krause.</p>

<p>"There's no reason for him to have made up such a cock-and-bull
story," replied de Groote; "yes, I believe him; he's one of the
best hands on the ship&mdash;a quiet little fellow who always does
his work and minds his own business."</p>

<p>"What had we better do?" asked Krause.</p>

<p>"I'd put Schmidt under arrest immediately," said de Groote.</p>

<p>The cabin door swung open; and Schmidt stood in the doorway, an
automatic in his hand. "Like hell, you'll put me under arrest, you
damned Dutchman," he said. "We saw that dirty little Chink talking
to you, and we had a pretty good idea what he was saying."</p>

<p>Half a dozen Lascars pressed behind Schmidt, outside the
doorway. "Tie 'em up," he said to them.</p>

<p>The sailors brushed past Schmidt into the cabin; de Groote
stepped in front of the girl. "Keep your dirty hands off her," he
said to the Lascars. One of them tried to push him aside and reach
Janette, and de Groote knocked him down. Instantly there was a
free-for-all; but only de Groote and Janette took part in it on
their side; Krause cowered in a corner and submitted fearfully to
having his hands tied behind his back. Janette picked up a pair of
heavy binoculars and felled one of the Lascars while de Groote sent
two more to the floor, but the odds were against them. When the
fight was over, they were both trussed up and de Groote was
unconscious from a blow on the head.</p>

<p>"This is mutiny, Schmidt," said Krause; "you'll hang for this if
you don't let me go."</p>

<p>"This is not mutiny," replied Schmidt. "This is an English ship,
and I'm taking it in the name of our Fhrer."</p>

<p>"But I'm a German," Krause objected; "I chartered this
ship&mdash;it is a German Ship."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Schmidt; "it is registered in England, and you
sail it under English colors. If you're a German, then you're a
traitor, and in Germany we know what to do with traitors."</p>

<h2><a name="S3-4" id="S3-4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN knew that something had happened aboard the
ship, but he did not know what. He saw a Chinese sailor strung up
by the thumbs and lashed. For two days he saw nothing of the girl
or the young 1st mate, and now he was not fed regularly or kept
supplied with water. He saw that the 2nd mate, who had spit on him,
was in command of the ship; and so, while he did not know, he
surmised what had happened. Abdullah Abu Nejm occasionally passed
his cage, but without molesting him; and Tarzan knew why&mdash;the
Arab was afraid of him, even though he were penned up in an iron
cage. He would not always be in a cage: Tarzan knew this and
Abdullah Abu Nejm feared it.</p>

<p>Now, Lascars swaggered about the ship and the Chinese did most
of the work. These, Schmidt cuffed and kicked on the slightest
provocation or on none at all. Tarzan had seen the man who had been
strung up by his thumbs and lashed cut down after an hour and
carried to the forecastle. The cruelty of the punishment disgusted
him, but of course he did not know but that the man deserved
it.</p>

<p>The 2nd mate never passed Tarzan's cage without stopping to
curse him. The very sight of Tarzan seemed to throw him into a fit
of uncontrollable rage, as did anything that stimulated his
inferiority complex. Tarzan could not understand why the man hated
him so; he did not know that Schmidt, being a psychopath, did not
have to have a reason for anything that he did.</p>

<p>Once he came to the cage with a harpoon in his hands and jabbed
it through the bars at the ape-man while Abdullah Abu Nejm looked
on approvingly. Tarzan seized the haft and jerked the thing from
Schmidt's hands as effortlessly as he might have taken it from a
baby. Now that the wild man was armed, Schmidt no longer came close
to the cage.</p>

<p>On the third day from that on which he had last seen the girl,
Tarzan saw his wooden cage and a larger iron cage hoisted to the
deck and lashed down near his; and a little later he saw the girl
led on deck by a couple of Lascar sailors and put into the wooden
cage; then de Groote and Krause were brought up and locked in the
iron cage, and presently Schmidt came from the bridge and stopped
in front of them.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Schmidt?" demanded de Groote.</p>

<p>"You complained about being locked up below, didn't you? You
should thank me for having you brought on deck instead of finding
fault. You'll get plenty of fresh air up here and a good tan; I
want you all to look your best when I exhibit you with the other
specimens of the lower orders in Berlin," and Schmidt laughed.</p>

<p>"If you want to amuse yourself by keeping Krause and me penned
up here like wild beasts, go ahead; but you can't mean that you're
going to keep Miss Laon here, a white woman exhibited before a lot
of Lascar sailors." It had been with difficulty that de Groote had
kept his anger and contempt from being reflected in his voice, but
he had long since come to the conclusion that they were in the
hands of a madman and that to antagonize him further would be but
to add to the indignities he had already heaped upon them.</p>

<p>"If Miss Laon wishes to, she may share the captain's cabin with
me," replied Schmidt; "I have had Larsen taken elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Miss Laon prefers the cage of a wild animal," said the
girl.</p>

<p>Schmidt shrugged. "That is a good idea," he said; "I shall see
about putting you into the cage of one of Herr Krause's lions, or
perhaps you would prefer a tiger."</p>

<p>"Either one, to you," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Or maybe into the cage with the wild man you have been so fond
of," suggested Schmidt; "that might afford a spectacle all would
enjoy. From what Abdullah tells me, the man is probably a cannibal.
I shall not feed him after I put you in with him."</p>

<p>Schmidt was laughing to himself as he walked away.</p>

<p>"The man is absolutely crazy," said de Groote. "I have known
right along that he was a little bit off, but I never expected that
he was an out-and-out madman."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that he will do what he has threatened?" asked
Janette.</p>

<p>Neither de Groote nor Krause replied, and their silence answered
her questions and confirmed her own fears. It had been all right to
feed the wild man and see that he had water, but she had always
been ready to spring away from his cage if he attempted to seize
her. She had really been very much afraid of him, but her natural
kindness had prompted her to befriend him. Furthermore, she had
known that it annoyed Krause, whom she secretly detested.</p>

<p>Stranded in Batavia, Janette had seized upon Krause's offer so
that she might get away, anywhere; and the prospect of New York had
also greatly intrigued her. She had heard much of the great
American metropolis and fabulous stories of the ease with which a
beautiful girl might acquire minks and sables and jewels there, and
Janette Laon knew that she would be beautiful in any country.</p>

<p>Although neither de Groote nor Krause had answered Janette's
question, it was soon answered. Schmidt returned with several
sailors; he and two of the Lascars were armed with pistols, and the
others carried prod poles such as were used in handling the wild
animals.</p>

<p>The sailors unlashed Janette's cage and pushed it against that
in which Tarzan was confined, the two doors in contact; then they
raised both doors.</p>

<p>"Get in there with your wild man," ordered Schmidt.</p>

<p>"You can't do that, Schmidt," cried de Groote. "For God's sake
man, don't do a thing like that!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Schmidt. "Get in there wench! Poke her up
with those prods, you!"</p>

<p>One of the Lascars prodded Janette, and Tarzan growled and
started forward. Three pistols instantly covered him, and sharp
pointed prods barred his way. The growl terrified the girl; but,
realizing that they could force her into the cage, she suddenly
walked in boldly, her chin up. The iron gate of the cage dropped
behind her, the final seal upon her doom.</p>

<p>De Groote, Krause, Schmidt, and the Lascars awaited in
breathless silence for the tragedy they anticipated with varying
emotions: Schmidt pleasurably, the Lascars indifferently, Krause
nervously, and de Groote with such emotions as his phlegmatic Dutch
psyche had never before experienced: Had he been a Frenchman or an
Italian, he would probably have screamed and torn his hair: but,
being a Dutchman, he held his emotions in leash within him.</p>

<p>Janette Laon stood just within the doorway of the cage, waiting;
she looked at Tarzan and Tarzan looked at her. He knew that she was
afraid and he wished that he might speak to her and reassure her;
then he did the only thing that he could; he smiled at her. It was
the first time that she had seen him smile. She wanted to believe
that it was a reassuring smile, a friendly smile; but she had been
told such terrible stories of his ferocity that she was uncertain;
it might be a smile of anticipation. To be on the safe side, she
forced an answering smile.</p>

<p>Tarzan picked up the harpoon he had taken from Schmidt and
crossed the cage toward her. "Shoot him, Schmidt!" shouted de
Groote; "he is going to kill her."</p>

<p>"You think I am crazy?&mdash;to kill a valuable exhibit like
that!" replied Schmidt. "Now we see some fun."</p>

<p>Tarzan handed the harpoon to the girl, and went back and sat
down at the far end of the cage. The implication of the gesture was
unmistakable. Janette felt her knees giving from beneath her; and
sat down quickly, lest she fall. Sudden relief from terrific
nervous strain often induces such a reaction. De Groote broke into
a violent sweat.</p>

<p>Schmidt fairly jumped up and down in rage and disappointment.
"Wild man!" he shrieked. "I thought you said that thing was a wild
man, Abdullah. You are a cheat! You are a liar!"</p>

<p>"If you don't think he's a wild man, Nasrany," replied the Arab,
"go yourself into his cage."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-5" id="S3-5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN sat with his eyes fixed on Schmidt. He had
understood nothing that the man had said; but from his facial
expressions, his gestures, his actions, and by all that had
occurred, he had judged the man correctly; another score was
chalked up against Herr Schmidt; another nail had been driven into
his coffin.</p>

<p>The next morning the two captives in the big iron cage were very
happy. Janette was happy because she found herself safe and
unharmed after a night spent with a creature who ate his meat raw
and growled while he ate, a wild man who had killed three African
warriors with his bare hands before they could overpower him, and
whom Abdullah accused of being a cannibal. She was so happy that
she sang a snatch of a French song that had been popular when she
left Paris. And Tarzan was happy because he understood the words;
while he had slept his affliction had left him as suddenly as it
had struck.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said in French, the first human language he
had ever learned, taught to him by the French lieutenant he had
saved from death on a far gone day.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in surprise. "I&mdash;good morning!" she
stammered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;they told me you could not speak."</p>

<p>"I suffered an accident," he explained; "I am all right
now."</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said; "I&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Tarzan; "you were afraid of me. You need
not be."</p>

<p>"They said terrible things about you; but you must have I heard
them."</p>

<p>"I not only could not speak," Tarzan explained, "but I could not
understand. What did they say?"</p>

<p>"They said that you were very ferocious and that
you&mdash;you&mdash;ate people."</p>

<p>Again one of Tarzan's rare smiles. "And so they put you in here
hoping that I would eat you? Who did that?"</p>

<p>"Schmidt, the man who led the mutiny and took over the
ship."</p>

<p>"The man who spit on me," said Tarzan, and the girl thought that
she detected the shadow of a growl in his voice. Abdullah had been
right; the man did remind one of a lion. But now she was not
afraid.</p>

<p>"You disappointed Schmidt," she said. "He was furious when you
handed me the harpoon and went to the other end of the cage and sat
down. In no spoken language could one have assured him of my safety
more definitely."</p>

<p>"Why does he hate you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that he does hate me; he is a sadistic maniac. You
must have seen what he did to poor Lum Kip and how he kicks and
strikes others of the Chinese sailors."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me what has gone on aboard the ship that
I have not been able to understand and just what they intend doing
with me, if you know."</p>

<p>"Krause was taking you to America to exhibit as a wild man along
with his other&mdash;I mean along with his wild animals."</p>

<p>Again Tarzan smiled. "Krause is the man in the cage with the 1st
mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now tell me about the mutiny and what you know of Schmidt's
plans."</p>

<p>When she had finished, Tarzan had every principal in the drama
of the Saigon definitely placed; and it seemed to him that only the
girl, de Groote, and the Chinese sailors were worthy of any
consideration&mdash;they and the caged beasts.</p>

<p>De Groote awoke, and the first thing that he did was to call to
Janette from his cage. "You are all right?" he asked. "He didn't
offer to harm you?"</p>

<p>"Not in any way," she assured him.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a talk with Schmidt today and see if I can't
persuade him to take you out of that cage. I think that if Krause
and I agree never to prefer charges against him, if he lets you
out, he may do it."</p>

<p>"This is the safest place on the ship for me; I don't want to
get out as long as Schmidt is in control."</p>

<p>De Groote looked at her in astonishment. "But that fellow is
half beast," he exclaimed. "He may not have harmed you yet; but you
never can tell what he might do, especially if Schmidt starves him
as he has threatened."</p>

<p>Janette laughed. "You'd better be careful what you say about him
if you think he is such a ferocious wild man; he might get out of
this cage some time."</p>

<p>"Oh, he can't understand me," said de Groote; "and he can't get
out of the cage."</p>

<p>Krause had been awakened by the conversation, and now he came
and stood beside de Groote. "I'll say he can't get out of that
cage," he said, "and Schmidt will see that he never gets the
chance; Schmidt knows what he would get, and you needn't worry
about his understanding anything we say; he's as dumb as they make
'em."</p>

<p>Janette turned to look at Tarzan to note the effect of de
Groote's and Krause's words, wondering if he would let them know
that he did understand and was thoroughly enjoying the situation.
To her surprise she saw that the man had lain down close to the
bars and was apparently asleep; then she saw Schmidt approaching
and curbed her desire to acquaint de Groote and Krause with the
fact that their wild man could have understood everything they
said, if he had heard them.</p>

<p>Schmidt came up to the cage. "So you are still alive," he said.
"I hope you enjoyed your night with the monkey man. If you will
teach him some tricks, I'll exhibit you as his trainer." He moved
close to the cage and looked down at Tarzan. "Is he asleep, or did
you have to kill him?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Tarzan's hand shot between the bars and seized one of
Schmidt's ankles; then the ape man jerked the leg into the cage its
full length, throwing Schmidt upon his back. Schmidt screamed, and
Tarzan's other hand shot and plucked the man's pistol from its
holster.</p>

<p>"Help!" screamed Schmidt. "Abdullah! Jabu Singh! Chand!
Help!"</p>

<p>Tarzan twisted the leg until the man screamed again from pain.
Abdullah, Jabu Singh, and Chand came running in answer to Schmidt's
cries; but when they saw that the wild man was pointing a pistol in
their direction, they stopped.</p>

<p>"Have food and water brought, or I'll twist your leg off," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The dog of an English speaks!" muttered Abdullah. De Groote and
Krause looked in amazement.</p>

<p>"If he speaks, he must have understood us," said Krause. "Maybe
he has understood all along," Krause tried to recall what he might
have said that some day he might regret, for he knew that the man
could not be kept in a cage forever&mdash;unless. But the fellow
had a gun now; it would not be so easy to kill him. He would speak
to Schmidt about it; it was as much to Schmidt's interests as his
now to have the man put out of the way.</p>

<p>Schmidt was screaming for food and water. Suddenly de Groote
cried, "Look out, man! Look out! Behind you!" But it was too late;
a pistol spoke, and Tarzan collapsed upon the floor of the cage,
Jabu Singh had crept up behind the cage, unnoticed until the thing
had been done.</p>

<p>Schmidt scrambled out of the way, but Janette recovered the
pistol; and, turning, shot Jabu Singh as he was about to fire
another shot into the prostrate man. Her shot struck the Lascar in
the right arm, causing him to drop his weapon; then, keeping him
covered, the girl crossed the cage, reached through the bars, and
retrieved Jabu Singh's pistol. Now, she crossed back to Tarzan,
knelt above him, and placed her ear over his heart.</p>

<p>As Schmidt stood trembling and cursing in impotent fury, a ship
was sighted from the bridge; and he limped away to have a look at
it. The Saigon was running without colors, ready to assume any
nationality that Schmidt might choose when an emergency arose.</p>

<p>The stranger proved to be an English yacht; so Schmidt ran up
the English flag; then he radioed, asking if they had a doctor on
board, as he had two men suffering from injuries, which was quite
true; at least Jabu Singh was suffering, with vocal accompaniment;
Tarzan still lay where he had fallen.</p>

<p>The yacht had a doctor aboard, and Schmidt said that he would
send a boat for him. He, himself, went with the boat, which was
filled with Lascars armed with whatever they could find, a weird
assortment of pistols, rifles, boat hooks, knives, and animal
prods, all well hidden from sight.</p>

<p>Coming alongside the yacht, they swarmed up the Jacob's ladder
and onto the deck before the astonished yachtsmen realized that
they were being boarded with sinister intent. At the same time, the
Saigon struck the English flag and ran up the German.</p>

<p>Twenty-five or thirty men and a girl on the deck of the yacht
looked with amazement on the savage, piratical-appearing company
confronting them with armed force.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" demanded the yacht's captain.</p>

<p>Schmidt pointed at the German flag flying above the Saigon. "It
means that I am seizing you in the name of the German Government,"
replied Schmidt; "I am taking you over as a prize, and shall put a
prize crew aboard. Your engineer and navigating officer will remain
aboard. My first mate, Jabu Singh, will be in command. He has
suffered a slight accident; your doctor will dress the wound, and
the rest of you will return to my ship with me. You are to consider
yourselves prisoners of war, and conduct yourselves
accordingly."</p>

<p>"But, man," expostulated the Captain, "this vessel is not armed,
it is not a warship, it is not even a merchant vessel; it is a
private yacht on a scientific expedition. You, a merchantman, can't
possibly contemplate taking us over."</p>

<p>"But I say, old thing!" said a tall young man in flannels; "you
can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Schmidt. "You are English, and that is enough
reason for taking you over. Come now! Where's that doctor? Get
busy."</p>

<p>While the doctor was dressing Jabu Singh's wound, Schmidt had
his men search the ship for arms and ammunition. They found several
pistols and sporting rifles; and, the doctor having finished with
Jabu Singh, Schmidt detailed some of his men and left a few of the
yacht's sailors to man the craft; then he herded the remainder into
the Saigon's boat and returned with them to the steamer.</p>

<p>"I say," exclaimed the young man in white flannels, "this is a
beastly outrage."</p>

<p>"It might have been worse, Algy," said the girl; "maybe you
won't have to marry me now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, old thing," expostulated the young man; "this might
even be worse."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-6" id="S3-6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE bullet that had dropped Tarzan had merely
grazed his head, inflicting a superficial flesh wound and stunning
him for a few minutes; but he had soon recovered and now he and
Janette Laon watched the prisoners as they came over the side of
the Saigon.</p>

<p>"Schmidt has turned pirate," remarked the girl. "I wonder what
he is going to do with all those people! There must be fifteen of
them."</p>

<p>She did not have long to wait for an answer to her inquiry.
Schmidt sent the eight crew members forward when they agreed to
help man the Saigon; then he had two more iron cages hoisted to the
deck and lined up with the two already there. "Now," he said, "I
know I shouldn't do it, but I am going to let you choose your own
cage mates."</p>

<p>"I say!" cried Algernon Wright-Smith; "you're not going to put
the ladies in one of those things!"</p>

<p>"What's good enough for an English pig is good enough for an
English sow," growled Schmidt; "hurry up and decide what you want
to do."</p>

<p>An elderly man with a white walrus mustache, harrumphed angrily,
his red face becoming purple. "You damned bounder!" he snorted;
"you can't do a thing like that to English women."</p>

<p>"Don't excite yourself, Uncle," said the girl; "We'll have to do
as the fellow says."</p>

<p>"I shall not step a foot into one of those things, William,"
said the second woman in the party, a lady who carried her fifty
odd years rather heavily around her waist. "Nor shall Patricia,"
she added.</p>

<p>"Come, come," expostulated the girl; "we're absolutely helpless,
you know," and with that she entered the smaller of the two cages;
and presently her uncle and her aunt, finally realizing the
futility of resistance, joined her. Captain Bolton, Tibbet, the
second mate of the yacht, Dr. Crouch, and Algy, were herded into
the second cage.</p>

<p>Schmidt walked up and down in front of the cages, gloating. "A
fine menagerie I am getting," he said; "A French girl, a German
traitor, a Dutch dog, and seven English pigs: with my apes,
monkeys, lions, tigers, and elephants we shall be a sensation in
Berlin."</p>

<p>The cage in which the Leigh's and their niece were confined was
next to that occupied by Tarzan and Janette Laon; and beyond the
Leigh's cage was that in which the other four Englishmen were
imprisoned.</p>

<p>Penelope Leigh eyed Tarzan askance and with aversion.
"Shocking!" she whispered to her niece, Patricia; "the fellow is
practically naked."</p>

<p>"He's rather nice looking, Aunty," suggested Patricia
Leigh-Burden.</p>

<p>"Don't look at him," snapped Penelope Leigh; "and that
woman&mdash;do you suppose that is his wife?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't look like a wild woman," said Patricia.</p>

<p>"Then what is she doing alone in that cage with that man?"
demanded Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she was put there just the way we were put here."</p>

<p>"Well!" snorted Penelope Leigh; "she looks like a loose woman to
me."</p>

<p>"Now," shouted Schmidt, "we are about the feed the animals;
everyone who is not on duty may come and watch."</p>

<p>Lascars, and Chinese, and several of the yacht's crew, gathered
in front of the cages as food and water were brought; the former an
unpalatable, nondescript mess, the contents of which it would have
been difficult to determine, either by sight or taste. Tarzan was
given a hunk of raw meat.</p>

<p>"Disgusting," snorting Penelope Leigh, as she pushed the
unsavory mess from her. A moment later her attention was attracted
by growls coming from the adjoining cage; and when she looked, she
gasped, horror-stricken. "Look!" she whispered in a trembling
voice; "that creature is growling, and he is eating his meat raw;
how horrible!"</p>

<p>"I find him fascinating," said Patricia.</p>

<p>"Hurrumph!" growled Colonel William Cecil Hugh Percival Leigh;
"filthy blighter."</p>

<p>"Canaille!" snapped Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked up at Janette Laon, that shadowy smile just
touching his lips, and winked.</p>

<p>"You understand English too?" she asked. Tarzan nodded. "Do you
mind if I have some fun with them?" she continued.</p>

<p>"No," replied Tarzan; "go as far as you wish." They had both
spoken in French and in whispers.</p>

<p>"Do you find the captain palatable," she asked in English loudly
enough to be heard in the adjoining cage.</p>

<p>"He is not as good as the Swede they gave me last week," replied
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh paled and became violently nauseated; she sat down
suddenly and heavily. The colonel, inclined to be a little
pop-eyed, was even more so as he gazed incredulously into the
adjoining cage. His niece came close to him and whispered, "I think
they are spoofing us, Uncle; I saw him wink at that girl."</p>

<p>"My smelling salts!" gasped Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, colonel?" asked Algernon Wright-Smith, from
the adjoining cage.</p>

<p>"That devil is eating the captain," replied the colonel in a
whisper that could have been heard half a block away. De Groote
grinned.</p>

<p>"My word!" exclaimed Algy. Janette Laon turned her head away to
hide her laughter, and Tarzan continued to tear at the meat with
his strong, white teeth.</p>

<p>"I tell you they are making fools of us," said Patricia
Leigh-Burden. "You can't make me believe that civilized human
beings would permit that man to eat human flesh, even if he wished
to, which I doubt. When that girl turned away, I could see her
shoulders shaking&mdash;she was laughing."</p>

<p>"What's that, William?" cried Mrs. Leigh, as the roar of a lion
rose from the hold.</p>

<p>The animals had been unnaturally quiet for some time; but now
they were getting hungry, and the complaint of the lion started
them off, with the result that in a few moments of blood-curdling
diapason of savagery billowed up from below: the rumbling roars of
lions, the coughing growls of tigers, the hideous laughter of
hyenas, the trumpeting of elephants mingled with the medley of
sounds from the lesser beasts.</p>

<p>"Oh-h-h!" screamed Mrs. Leigh. "How hideous! Make them stop that
noise at once, William."</p>

<p>"Harrumph!" said the colonel, but without his usual vigor.
Presently, however, as the Chinese and Indian keepers fed the
animals, the noise subsided and quiet was again restored.</p>

<p>As night approached, the sky became overcast and the wind
increased, and with the rolling of the ship the animals again
became restless. A Lascar came and passed buckets of water into all
of the cages except that in which Tarzan was confined. To do this,
he had to unlock the cage doors and raise them sufficiently to pass
the pails through; then he passed in a broom, with which the
inmates were supposed to clean their cages. Although he was
accompanied by two other sailors armed with rifles, he did not
unlock the door of Tarzan's cage, for Schmidt was afraid to take a
chance on the wild man's escaping.</p>

<p>Tarzan had watched this procedure which had occurred daily ever
since he had been brought aboard the Saigon. He knew that the same
Lascar always brought the water and that he came again at about
four bells of the first night watch to make a final inspection of
the captives. On this tour of duty he came alone, as he did not
have to unlock the cages; but Schmidt, in order to be on the safe
side, had armed him with a pistol.</p>

<p>This afternoon, as he was passing the water into the cage
occupied by the Leighs, the colonel questioned him. "Steward," he
said, "fetch us four steamer chairs and rugs," and he handed the
Lascar a five pound note.</p>

<p>The sailor took the note, looked at it, and stuffed it into his
dirty loin cloth. "No chairs; no rugs," he said and started on
toward the next cage.</p>

<p>"Hi, fellow!" shouted the colonel; "come back here! Who is
captain of this ship? I want to see the captain."</p>

<p>"Sahib Schmidt captain now," replied the Lascar. "Captain Larsen
sick; no see three, four days; maybe dead;" then he moved on and
the colonel made no effort to detain him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh shuddered. "It was the captain," she breathed in a
horrified whisper, her terrified gaze riveted on a bone in Tarzan's
cage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-7" id="S3-7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">RAIN fell in torrents and the wind whistled
through the cages, driving it in myriad needle points against the
unprotected inmates. The sea rose and the Saigon rolled and pitched
heavily; lightning flashes illuminated the ship momentarily and
heralded the deep booming of the following thunder which
momentarily drowned out the roars and growls and trumpeting of
terrified beasts.</p>

<p>Tarzan stood erect in his cage enjoying the lashing of the rain,
the thunder, and the lightning. Each vivid flash revealed the
occupants of adjoining cages, and during one of them he saw that
the Englishman had placed his coat around the shoulders of his wife
and was trying to shield her body from the storm with his own. The
English girl stood erect, as did Tarzan, seeming to enjoy this
battle with the elements. It was then that the ape man decided that
he liked these two.</p>

<p>Tarzan was waiting; he was waiting for the Lascar to make his
nightly inspection; but that night the Lascar did not come. The
Lord of the Jungle could wait with that patience he had learned
from the wild creatures among whom he had been reared; some night
the Lascar would return.</p>

<p>The storm increased in fury; the Saigon was running before it
now with great following seas always threatening to break over her
stern. The wind howled in throaty anguish and hurled spume to join
with the rain in deluging the miserable prisoners in their cages.
Janette Laon lay down and tried to sleep. The English girl paced
back and forth in the narrow confines of her cage. Tarzan watched
her; he knew her type; an outdoor girl; the free swing of her walk
proclaimed it. She would be efficient in anything she undertook,
and she could endure hardship without complaining. Tarzan was sure
of that, for he had watched her ever since she had been brought
aboard the Saigon, had heard her speak, and had noticed her
acceptance of the inevitable in a spirit similar to his own. He
imagined that she would wait patiently until her opportunity came
and that then she would act with courage and intelligence.</p>

<p>As he watched her now, taking the rain and the wind and the
pitching of the ship as though they were quite the usual thing, she
stopped at the side of her cage that adjoined his and looked at
him.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy the captain?" she asked with a quick smile.</p>

<p>"He was a little too salty," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Swede was better," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Much; especially the dark meat."</p>

<p>"Why did you try to frighten us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Your uncle and aunt were not very complimentary in their
remarks about us."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "I'm sorry, but they were very much upset.
This has been a shocking experience for them. I am very much
worried about them; they are old and cannot put up with much more
of this. What do you think this man Schmidt intends doing with
us?"</p>

<p>"There is no telling; the man is mad. His plan to exhibit us in
Berlin is, of course, ridiculous. If he gets us to Berlin, we
English will, of course, be interned."</p>

<p>"You are an Englishman?"</p>

<p>"My father and mother were English."</p>

<p>"My name is Burden&mdash;Patricia Leigh-Burden," said the girl;
"may I ask yours?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan," replied the ape man.</p>

<p>"Just Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"That is all."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me how you happen to be in that cage, Mr.
Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"Just Tarzan," he corrected her; "no mister. I happen to be in
this cage because Abdullah Abu Nejm wished to be revenged; so he
had me captured by an African chief who also had reason to wish to
get rid of me. Abdullah sold me to a man by the name of Krause who
was collecting animals to sell in America. Krause is in the cage
next to mine on the other side. Schmidt, who was 2nd mate, has
Krause's ship, his wild man, and all his animals. He also has
Krause."</p>

<p>"He won't have any of us long if this storm gets much worse,"
said the girl. She was clinging to the bars of the cage now, as the
ship dove into the trough of a sea, rolling and wallowing as it was
lifted to the crest of the next.</p>

<p>"The Saigon doesn't look like much," said Janette Laon, who had
come to stand beside Tarzan, "but I think she will weather this
storm all right. We ran into a worse one coming out. Of course we
had Captain Larsen in command then, and Mr. de Groote was 1st mate;
it may be a different story with Schmidt in command."</p>

<p>The ship swung suddenly, quartering to the sea, and slithered
down into the trough, heeling over on her beam-ends. There was a
frightened scream as a flash of lightning revealed the colonel and
his wife being thrown heavily against the bars of their cage.</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Penelope!" cried the English girl; "she can't stand
much more of this." She worked her way around the side of the cage
to her aunt. "Are you hurt, Auntie?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Every bone in my body is broken," said Mrs. Leigh. "I never did
approve of that silly expedition. Who cares what lives at the
bottom of the ocean, anyway&mdash;you'd never meet any of them in
London. Now we have lost the Naiad and are about to lose our lives
in the bargain. I hope your uncle is satisfied." Patricia breathed
a sigh of relief, for she knew now that her aunt was all right. The
Colonel maintained a discreet silence: twenty-five years'
experience had taught him when to keep still.</p>

<p>The long night passed, but the storm did not abate in fury. The
Saigon still ran before it, slowed down to about five knots and
taking it on her quarter. An occasional wave broke over the stern,
flooding the decks, and almost submerging the inmates of the cages,
who could only cling to the bars and hope for the best.</p>

<p>By her own testimony, Mrs. Leigh was drowned three times.
"Hereafter, William," she said, "you should stick to The Times,
Napoleon's campaigns, and Gibbon's Rome; the moment you read
anything else you go quite off your head. If you hadn't read that
Arcturus Adventure by that Beebe person, we would undoubtedly be
safe at home in England this minute. Just because he fished up a
lot of hideous creatures equipped with electric lights, you had to
come out and try it; I simply cannot understand it, William."</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on Uncle," said Patricia; "he might have
found some with hot and cold running water and become famous."</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>That day no one approached the cages, and neither food nor water
was brought to the captives. The animals below deck fared
similarly, and their plaints rose above the howling of the storm.
It was not until late in the afternoon of the third day that two of
the Chinese sailors brought food, and by this time the captives
were so famished that they wolfed it ravenously, notwithstanding
the fact that it was only a cold and soggy mess of ship's
biscuit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh had lapsed into total silence; and both her niece and
her husband were worried, for they knew that when Penelope Leigh
failed to complain there must be something radically wrong with
her.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock that night, the wind suddenly died down;
the calm that ensued was ominous. "We have reached the center of
it," said Janette Laon.</p>

<p>"Soon it will be bad again," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The fool should have run out of it, not into it," said
Janette.</p>

<p>Tarzan was waiting patiently, like a lion at a
waterhole&mdash;waiting for his prey to come. "It is better thus,"
he said to the girl.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she replied, "I do not see how it could
be worse."</p>

<p>"Wait," he said, "and I think you will see presently."</p>

<p>While the seas were still high, the Saigon seemed to be taking
them better now, and presently Schmidt appeared on deck and came
down to the cages. "How's the livestock?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"These women will die if you keep them in here, Schmidt," said
de Groote. "Why can't you take them out and give them a cabin, or
at least put them below decks where they will be protected from the
storm?"</p>

<p>"If I hear any more complaints," said Schmidt, "I'll dump the
whole lot of you overboard, cages and all. What do you want anyway?
You're getting free transportation, free food, and private rooms.
You've been getting free shower baths, too, for the last three
days."</p>

<p>"But, man, my wife will die if she is exposed much longer," said
Colonel Leigh.</p>

<p>"Let her die," said Schmidt, "I need some fresh meat for the
wild man and the other animals," with which parting pleasantry,
Schmidt returned to the bridge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh was sobbing, and the Colonel was cursing luridly.
Tarzan was waiting, and presently that for which he was waiting
came to pass; Asoka, the Lascar, was coming to make his belated
inspection. He swaggered a little, feeling the importance of being
keeper of English sahibs and their ladies.</p>

<p>The ship's lights relieved the darkness sufficiently so that
objects were discernible at some distance, and Tarzan, whose eyes
were trained by habit to see at night, had recognized Asoka
immediately he came on deck.</p>

<p>The ape-man stood grasping two adjacent bars of his cage as
Asoka passed, keeping well out of arm's reach of the wild man.
Janette Laon stood beside Tarzan; she intuitively sensed that
something important was impending.</p>

<p>Her eyes were on her cage mate; she saw the muscles of his
shoulders and his arms tense as he exerted all their tremendous
power upon the bars of his cage. And then she saw those bars slowly
spread and Tarzan of the Apes step through to freedom.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-8" id="S3-8">CHAPTER VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ASOKA, the Lascar, swaggered on past the cage of
the Leigh's, and when he was opposite that in which the four
Englishmen were confined, steel-thewed fingers closed upon his
throat from behind, and his gun was snatched from its holster.</p>

<p>Janette Laon had watched with amazement the seeming ease with
which those Herculean muscles had separated the bars. She had seen
Tarzan overtake the Lascar and disarm him; and now she stepped
through the opening after him, carrying the pistols they had taken
from Schmidt and Jabu Singh.</p>

<p>Asoka struggled and tried to cry out until a grim voice
whispered in his ear, "Quiet, or I kill;" then he subsided.</p>

<p>Tarzan glanced back and saw Janette Laon behind him. Then he
took the key to the cages which hung about Asoka's neck on a piece
of cord and handed it to the girl. "Come with me and unlock them,"
he said, and passed around the end of the last cage to the doors,
which were on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"You men will come with me," said Tarzan in a whisper; "the
Colonel and the women will remain here."</p>

<p>As Tarzan came opposite the cage of the Leigh's, Mrs. Leigh, who
had been dozing during the lull in the storm, awoke and saw him.
She voiced a little scream and cried, "The wild man has
escaped!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Penelope," growled the Colonel; "he is going to let us
out of this damn cage."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare curse me, William Cecil Hugh Percival Leigh,"
cried Penelope.</p>

<p>"Quiet," growled Tarzan, and Penelope Leigh subsided into
terrified silence.</p>

<p>"You may come out," said Tarzan, "but remain close to the cages
until we return." Then he followed Janette to the cage in which de
Groote and Krause were imprisoned and waited until she had removed
the padlock.</p>

<p>"De Groote may come out," he said; "Krause will remain. Asoka,
you get in there." He turned to Janette. "Lock them in," he said.
"Give me one of the pistols and keep the other yourself; if either
of these two tries to raise an alarm, shoot him. Do you think you
could do that?"</p>

<p>"I shot Jabu Singh," she reminded him.</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded and then turned to the men behind him; he handed
Asoka's pistol to de Groote. He had appraised the other men since
they had come aboard, and now he told Janette to give her second
pistol to Tibbet, the second mate of the Naiad.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tibbet," replied the mate.</p>

<p>"You will come with me. We will take over on the bridge. De
Groote knows the ship. He and the others will look for arms. In the
meantime, pick up anything you can to fight with, for there may be
fighting."</p>

<p>The ship had passed beyond the center of the storm, and the wind
was howling with renewed violence. The Saigon was pitching and
rolling violently as Tarzan and Tibbet ascended the ladder to the
bridge, where the Lascar, Chand, was at the wheel and Schmidt on
watch. By chance, Schmidt happened to turn just as Tarzan entered,
and seeing him, reached for his gun, at the same time shouting a
warning to Chand. Tarzan sprang forward, swift as Ara, the
lightning, and struck up Schmidt's hand just as he squeezed the
trigger. The bullet lodged in the ceiling, and an instant later,
Schmidt was disarmed. In the meantime, Tibbet had covered Chand and
disarmed him.</p>

<p>"Take the wheel," said Tarzan, "and give me the other gun. Keep
a look-out behind you and shoot anyone who tries to take over. You
two get down to the cages," he said to Schmidt and Chand. He
followed them down the ladder to the deck and herded them to the
cage where Krause and Asoka were confined.</p>

<p>"Open that up, Janette," he said; "I have two more animals for
our menagerie."</p>

<p>"This is mutiny," blustered Schmidt, "and when I get you to
Berlin, you'll be beheaded for it."</p>

<p>"Get in there," said Tarzan, and pushed Schmidt so violently,
that when he collided with Krause, both men went down.</p>

<p>Above the din of the storm they heard a shot from below, and
Tarzan hurried in the direction from which the sound had come. As
he descended the ladder, he heard two more shots and the voices of
men cursing and screams of pain.</p>

<p>As he came upon the scene of the fight, he saw that his men had
been taken from the rear by armed Lascars, but there seemed to have
been more noise than damage. One of the Lascars had been wounded.
It was he who was screaming. But aside from the single casualty, no
damage seemed to have been done on either side. Three of the four
Lascars remained on their feet, and they were firing wildly and
indiscriminately, as Tarzan came up behind them carrying a gun in
each hand.</p>

<p>"Drop your pistols," he said, "or I kill."</p>

<p>The three men swung around then, almost simultaneously. Looking
into the muzzles of Tarzan's two pistols, two of the Lascars
dropped theirs, but the third took deliberate aim and fired. Tarzan
fired at the same instant, and the Lascar clutched at his chest and
lurched forward upon his face.</p>

<p>The rest was easy. De Groote found the pistols, rifles, and
ammunition taken from the Naiad in Schmidt's cabin, and with all
the rest of the party disarmed, Oubanovitch and the remaining
Lascars put up no resistance. The Chinese and the impressed members
of the Naiad's crew had never offered any, being more than glad to
be relieved of service under a madman.</p>

<p>The ship safely in his hands, Tarzan gathered his party into the
ship's little saloon. Penelope Leigh still regarded him with
disgust not unmixed with terror; to her he was still a wild man, a
cannibal who had eaten the Captain and the Swede and would
doubtless, sooner or later, eat all of them. The others, however,
were appreciative of the strength and courage and intelligence
which had released them from a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>"Bolton," said Tarzan to the captain of the Naiad, "you will
take command of the ship; de Groote will be your first mate, Tibbet
your second. De Groote tells me there are only two cabins on the
Saigon. Colonel and Mrs. Leigh will take the Captain's cabin, the
two girls will take that which was occupied by the mates."</p>

<p>"He is actually giving orders to us," Penelope Leigh whispered
to her husband; "you should do something about it, William; you
should be in command."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Auntie," snapped Patricia Leigh-Burden, in a
whisper; "we owe everything to this man. He was magnificent. If you
had seen him spread those bars as though they were made of
lead!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Mrs. Leigh; "I am not accustomed to
being ordered about by naked wild men; why doesn't somebody loan
him some trousers?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Penelope," said the Colonel, "if you feel that way
about it I'll loan him mine&mdash;haw!!&mdash;then I won't have
any&mdash;haw! haw!"</p>

<p>"Don't be vulgar, William," snapped Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>Tarzan went to the bridge and explained to de Groote the
arrangements that he had made. "I'm glad you didn't put me in
command," said the Dutchman; "I haven't had enough experience.
Bolton should be a good man. He used to be in the Royal Navy. How
about Oubanovitch?"</p>

<p>"I have sent for him," replied Tarzan, "he should be here in a
moment."</p>

<p>"He's against everybody," said de Groote, "a died-in-the-wool
Communist. Here he comes now."</p>

<p>Oubanovitch slouched in, sullen and suspicious. "What are you
two doing up here?" he demanded; "where's Schmidt?"</p>

<p>"He is where you are going if you don't want to carry on with
us," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked Oubanovitch.</p>

<p>"In a cage with Krause and a couple of Lascars," replied the
ape-man. "I don't know whether you had anything to do with the
mutiny or not, Oubanovitch, but if you care to continue on as
engineer, nobody is going to ask any questions."</p>

<p>The scowling Russian nodded. "All right," he said; "you can't be
no worse than that crazy Schmidt."</p>

<p>"Captain Bolton is in command. Report to him and tell him that
you are the engineer. Do you know what has become of the Arab? I
haven't seen him for several days."</p>

<p>"He's always in the engine room keeping warm."</p>

<p>"Tell him to report to me here on the bridge and ask Captain
Bolton to send us a couple of men."</p>

<p>The two men strained their eyes out into the darkness ahead.
They saw the ship's nose plow into a great sea from which she
staggered sluggishly. "It's getting worse," remarked de Groote.</p>

<p>"Can she weather much more?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I think so," said de Groote, "as long as I can keep it on her
quarter, we can keep enough speed to give her steerageway."</p>

<p>A shot sounded from behind them, and the glass in the window in
front of them shattered. Both men wheeled about to see Abdullah Abu
Nejm standing at the top of the ladder with a smoking pistol in his
hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-9" id="S3-9">CHAPTER IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Arab fired again, but the plunging and the
pitching of the Saigon spoiled his aim and he missed just as Tarzan
sprang for him.</p>

<p>The impact of the ape-man's body carried Abdullah backward from
the ladder, and both men crashed heavily to the deck below, the
Arab beneath&mdash;a stunned, inert mass.</p>

<p>The two sailors, whom Captain Bolton was sending to the bridge,
came on deck just in time to see what had happened; and they both
ran forward, thinking to find a couple of broken, unconscious men,
but there was only one in that condition.</p>

<p>Tarzan sprang to his feet, but Abdullah Abu Nejm lay where he
had fallen. "One of you men go below and ask Miss Laon for the keys
to the cages," Tarzan directed; then he seized the Arab by the arms
and dragged him back to the cage in which Krause and Schmidt were
confined, and when the key was brought, he opened the door and
tossed the Arab in. Whether the man were alive or dead, Tarzan did
not know or care.</p>

<p>The storm increased in fury, and shortly before daylight the
steamer fell into the trough of the sea, rolling on its beam-ends
and hanging there for an instant, as though about to capsize; then
it would roll back the other way and for another harrowing moment
the end seemed inevitable. The change in the motion of the ship
awakened Tarzan instantly, and he made his way to the
bridge&mdash;a feat that was not too difficult for a man who had
been raised in a forest by apes and swung through the trees for the
greater part of his life, for he climbed to the bridge more often
than he walked. He found the two sailors clinging to the wheel, and
the Captain to a stanchion.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The rudder's carried away," said Bolton. "If we could rig a sea
anchor, we might have a chance of riding it out; but that is
impossible in this sea. How the devil did you get up here, with the
ship standing on her beam-ends as fast as she can roll from one
side to the other?"</p>

<p>"I climbed," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Bolton grumbled something that sounded like, "most
extraordinary;" then he said, "I think it's letting up; if she can
take this, we ought to be able to pull through, though even then
we're going to be in a pretty bad fix, as I understand from one of
these men, that that fellow, Schmidt, destroyed the radio."</p>

<p>As though to prove what she could do or couldn't do, the Saigon
rolled over until her decks were vertical&mdash;and hung there. "My
God!" cried one of the sailors; "she's going over!"</p>

<p>But she didn't go over; she rolled back, but not so far this
time. The wind was coming in fitful gusts now; the storm was very
definitely dying out.</p>

<p>Just before dawn, the Captain said, "Listen, do you hear
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan, "I have been hearing it for sometime."</p>

<p>"Do you know what it is?" asked Bolton.</p>

<p>"I do," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Breakers," said Bolton; "that's all we need to finish us up
completely."</p>

<p>Slowly and grudgingly dawn came, as though held back by the same
malign genie that had directed the entire cruise of the ill-fated
Saigon. And, to leeward, the men on the bridge saw a volcanic
island, its mountains clothed in tropical foliage, their summits
hidden in low-hanging clouds. The seas were breaking on a coral
reef a quarter-mile off shore, and toward this reef the Saigon was
drifting.</p>

<p>"There is an opening in that reef to the right there," said
Bolton. "I think we could lower boats now and get most of the
people ashore."</p>

<p>"You're the Captain," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Bolton ordered all hands on deck, and the men to their boat
stations, but a number of Lascars seized the first boat and started
lowering it away. De Groote rushed forward with drawn pistol in an
effort to stop them; but he was too late, as they had already
lowered away. His first inclination was to fire into them as an
example to the others, but instead he turned and held off the
remaining Lascars, who were about to seize a second boat. Bolton
and Tibbet joined him with drawn pistols, and the Lascars fell
back.</p>

<p>"Shoot the first man who disobeys an order," directed Bolton.
"Now," he continued, "we'll wait to see how that boat fares before
we lower another."</p>

<p>The Saigon was drifting helplessly toward the reef, as
passengers and crew lined the rail watching the crew of the
life-boat battling the great seas in an effort to make the opening
in the reef.</p>

<p>"If they make it at all, it's going to be close," said Dr.
Crouch.</p>

<p>"And the closer in the Saigon drifts, the more difficult it is
going to be for following boats," said Colonel Leigh.</p>

<p>"The bounders will never make it," said Algy, "and serves them
jolly well right."</p>

<p>"I believe they are going to make it," said Patricia. "What do
you think, Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," replied the ape-man, "and if they can't make it
with every oar manned and no passengers, the other boats wouldn't
have a ghost of a show."</p>

<p>"But isn't it worth trying?" asked the girl. "If the Saigon goes
on that reef, we are all lost; in the boat we would at least, have
a fighting chance."</p>

<p>"The wind and the sea are both going down," said Tarzan; "there
is quiet water just beyond the reef, and as the Saigon wouldn't
break up immediately, I think we would have a better chance that
way than in the boats, which would be stove in and sunk the moment
they struck the reef."</p>

<p>"I think you are right there," said Bolton, "but in an emergency
like this, where all our lives are at stake, I can speak only for
myself; I shall remain with the ship, but if there are enough who
wish to take to a boat to man it properly, I will have number four
boat lowered;" he looked around at the ship's company, but every
eye was upon the boat driving toward the reef and no one seemed
inclined to take the risk.</p>

<p>"They're not going to make it," said Tibbet.</p>

<p>"Not by a long way," agreed Dr. Crouch.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Janette Laon, "they're running straight for it
now."</p>

<p>"The bounders have got more sense than I thought they had,"
growled Colonel Leigh; "they see they can't make the opening and
now they are going to try to ride a wave over the reef."</p>

<p>"With luck they may make it," said Bolton.</p>

<p>"They'll need the luck of the Irish," said Crouch.</p>

<p>"There they go!" cried Algy. "Look at the bloody blighters
row."</p>

<p>"They took that wave just right," said Tibbet; "they're riding
it fast."</p>

<p>"There they go!" cried Janette.</p>

<p>The lifeboat was rushing toward the reef just below the crest of
a great sea, the Lascars pulling furiously to hold their position.
"They're over!" cried Patricia. But they were not; the prow struck
a projecting piece of coral, and the onrushing breaker upended the
boat, hurling the Lascars into the lagoon.</p>

<p>"Well, the men got across if the boat didn't," remarked
Crouch.</p>

<p>"I hope they can swim," said Janette.</p>

<p>"I hope they can't," growled the Colonel.</p>

<p>They watched the men floundering in the water for a minute or
two as they started to swim toward shore, and then Janette
exclaimed, "Why, they're standing up; they're walking!"</p>

<p>"That not surprising," said Bolton; "many of these coral lagoons
are shallow."</p>

<p>Both the wind and the sea were dying down rapidly and the Saigon
was drifting, but slowly, toward the reef; however, it would not be
long before she struck. The Saigon, illy equipped, afforded only a
few life belts. Three of these were given to the women, and the
others to members of the crew who said they could not swim.</p>

<p>"What do you think our chances are, Captain?" ask Colonel
Leigh.</p>

<p>"If we are lifted on the reef, we may have a chance, if she
hangs there for even a few minutes," replied Bolton, "but if she's
stove in before she lodges, she'll sink in deep water on this side
of the reef, and&mdash;well&mdash;you're guess is as good as mine,
sir; I'm going to have the rafts unshipped, the boats lowered on
deck and out loose&mdash;get as much stuff loose as will float and
carry people," and he gave orders to the crew to carry out this
work.</p>

<p>While the men were engaged in this work, there came a shout from
amidships: "Hi there, de Groote!" called Krause; "are you going to
leave us here to drown like rats in a trap?"</p>

<p>De Groote looked at Tarzan questioningly, and the ape-man turned
to Janette. "Let me have the key to the cages," he said, and when
she had handed it to him, he went to the cage in which Krause and
the others were confined. "I'm going to let you out," he said, "but
see that you behave yourselves; I have plenty of reason to kill any
of you white men, and I won't need much more of an excuse."</p>

<p>Abdullah was a sick-looking Arab, and all three of the white men
were sullen and scowling as they came out of the cage.</p>

<p>As they approached the rail, Bolton shouted, "Stand by the boats
and rafts; she's going to strike!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-10" id="S3-10">CHAPTER X</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE ship's company stood in tense expectancy as a
wave lifted the Saigon above a maelstrom of water surging over the
reef.</p>

<p>As the sea dropped them with terrific impact upon the jagged
coral rocks, the grinding and splintering of wood sounded her death
knell. She reeled drunkenly toward the deep water outside the reef.
More than one heart stood still in that tense moment; if she
slipped back into the sea many would be lost, and there was no
doubt now but that she was slipping.</p>

<p>"Percy," said Mrs. Leigh to the Colonel&mdash;she always called
him Percy in her softer moods&mdash;"Percy, if I have been trying
at times, I hope that you will forgive me now that we face our
Maker."</p>

<p>"Harrumph!" grunted the Colonel. "It is all my fault; I should
never have read that Beebe yarn."</p>

<p>As the Saigon slipped back into deep water, a following wave,
larger than that which had preceded it, lifted the ship again and
dropped her heavily upon the reef. This time she lodged firmly, and
as the wave receded, she was left resting with her decks almost
level.</p>

<p>"I say," said Algy, "this is a little bit of all right, what?
Just like Noah's Ark&mdash;a bally old tub full of wild animals
sitting high and dry on top of Mount Ararat."</p>

<p>A succession of smaller waves beat against the Saigon while the
men worked to get the boats and the rafts over into the lagoon; and
then another large wave broke entirely over the ship, but she did
not budge from her position.</p>

<p>Lines leading to the ship held the boats and the rafts from
drifting away, but now the question arose as to how to get the
women down to them. The reef was narrow, and the Saigon rested only
a few feet from its shoreward side. An athletic man might leap from
the rail, clear the reef, and land in the lagoon; but Mrs. Leigh
was not an athletic man, and she was the real problem.</p>

<p>She looked down over the rail of the ship at the waters still
surging across the reef. "I can never get down there, William," she
said; "you go on. Pay no attention to me; perhaps we shall meet in
a happier world."</p>

<p>"Bosh and nonsense," exclaimed the Colonel. "We'll get you down
some way."</p>

<p>"I'll go down there," said Tarzan, "and you lower her from one
of the ship's davits; I'll see that she's gotten on one of the
rafts safely."</p>

<p>"Never," said Mrs. Leigh emphatically.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Captain Bolton. "I shall expect you to lower
her immediately," he said, "and there will be no nonsense about it.
I'm going down now to see how deep the water is inside the reef.
Those who can't swim can jump in, and I will help them into one of
the boats or onto a raft." He climbed to the top of the rail,
poised there a moment, and then leaped far out, and dove towards
the lagoon.</p>

<p>All hands started towards the rail to watch him. They saw him
make a shallow dive and then turn over and disappear beneath the
surface. Presently his head broke the water, and he looked up. "It
is plenty deep right here," he said.</p>

<p>Patricia Leigh-Burden stripped off her life belt, climbed to the
rail, and dove. When she came up, Tarzan was beside her. "I don't
need to ask if you can swim," he said.</p>

<p>She smiled. "I'll stay here and help you with the others," she
said. Janette Laon was the next to jump. She did not dive, and she
just cleared the reef.</p>

<p>Tarzan had hold of her before she reached the surface. He still
supported her when their heads were above water.</p>

<p>"Can you swim?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied.</p>

<p>"You are a very brave girl," he said, as he swam towards one of
the boats with her and helped her aboard.</p>

<p>By this time, they had rigged a boatswain's chair and were
lowering a highly irate and protesting Mrs. Leigh over the ship's
side. As she reached the surface of the lagoon, Tarzan was awaiting
her.</p>

<p>"Young man," she snapped, "if anything happens to me, it will be
your fault."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said Tarzan, "and get out of that chair."</p>

<p>Probably in all her life, Penelope Leigh had never before been
spoken to in the voice of real authority; it not only took her
breath away, but it cowed her; and she slipped meekly out of the
boatswain's chair and into Tarzan's arms. He swam with her to one
of the rafts and helped her on, for they were easier to board than
the lifeboats.</p>

<p>Tarzan swam back to the ship. The boatswain's chair was still
swinging close above the water. He seized it and climbed hand over
hand to the deck. One by one, men were jumping or diving from the
rail when he stopped them.</p>

<p>"I want ten or fifteen volunteers for some very dangerous work,"
he said; "they have got to have what the Americans call
'guts'."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing?" asked Bolton.</p>

<p>"Now that everybody else is safely on shore, I am going to set
the animals free," said the ape man, "and make them take to the
water."</p>

<p>"But, man," cried Colonel Leigh, "many of them are dangerous
beasts of prey."</p>

<p>"Their lives are as important to them as ours are to us,"
replied Tarzan, "and I am not going to leave them here to die of
starvation."</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right," said the Colonel, "but why not
destroy them. That would be the humane way."</p>

<p>"I did not suggest destroying your wife or your friends," said
Tarzan, "and nobody is going to destroy my friends."</p>

<p>"Your friends?" ejaculated the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friends," replied the Lord of the Jungle, "or perhaps
it would be better to say, my people. I was born and raised among
them; I never saw a human being until I was almost grown, nor did I
see a white man 'til I was fully twenty years old. Will anyone
volunteer to help me save them?"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed the Colonel; "that is certainly a sporting
proposition; I'm with you, young man."</p>

<p>De Groote, Bolton, Tibbet, Crouch, a number of the Naiad crew
and several Chinese volunteered to help him, as well as the three
Indian keepers, who had been signed on by Krause to look after the
animals.</p>

<p>While those who had not volunteered to remain with him were
leaving the ship, Tarzan released the orangutans. He spoke to them
in their own language, and they clung to him like frightened
children; then he led his men below to the animal deck and opened
the great double doors in the side of the ship, through which all
of the larger animals had been loaded.</p>

<p>There were three Indian elephants, and these he liberated first,
as they were docile and well trained. He had one of the Indian
mahouts mount the best of these and told him to ride this one into
the lagoon the moment that a wave covered the reef. There was a
brief battle with the animal before it could be forced to take the
plunge; but once he was swimming, it was comparatively easy to get
the other two elephants to follow him, and then the African
elephants were released. These were wild beasts and far more
dangerous and difficult, but once their leader saw the Indian
elephants swimming away he lumbered into the lagoon and followed,
and his fellows trailed after him.</p>

<p>The cages of the lions and tigers were dragged one by one to the
door, the doors of the cages opened, and the cages tilted until the
beasts were spilled out. The lesser animals were disembarked in the
same way.</p>

<p>It was a long and arduous job, but at last it was over, and only
the snakes remained.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about them?" asked Bolton.</p>

<p>"Histah, the snake, has always been my enemy," replied Tarzan;
"him, we shall destroy."</p>

<p>They stood in the doorway of the ship watching the beasts making
their way toward shore, from which the empty boats and rafts were
already being returned to the ship in accordance with Bolton's
orders.</p>

<p>Along the shore line was a narrow beach, and beyond that dense
jungle broke gradually upward to the foot of the green-clad,
volcanic mountains which formed a fitting backdrop for the wild and
desolate scene.</p>

<p>The landing party huddled on the beach as the wild creatures
swam or waded to shore. But the animals bolted into the jungle as
fast as they came out of the water. A single elephant turned and
trumpeted, and a lion roared, whether in challenge or thanksgiving,
who may know? And then the jungle closed about them, and they took
up their new lives in a strange world.</p>

<p>Most of the sailors had returned to the ship with the rafts and
boats, and the remainder of the day was spent in transporting the
ship's stores to the beach.</p>

<p>For two days they worked, stripping the ship of everything that
might add to their comfort or convenience, and while half of the
men worked at this, the other half cut a clearing in the jungle,
for a permanent camp. They had chosen this site because a little
stream of fresh water ran through it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the third day when the work was almost
completed, a little party of a dozen men looked down upon the camp
from the summit of the cliff that hemmed the beach upon the south.
Concealed by the verdure there, they watched the first strangers
who had come to their island for many a long year.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-11" id="S3-11">CHAPTER XI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE men who watched the castaways of the Saigon
were warriors. They wore waist girdles which passed between their
legs; the ends, which hung down from the back, were elaborately
embroidered with colored threads or feather mosaic work; over their
shoulders was draped a square mantle, and they wore sandals made of
hide. Their heads were adorned with feather headdresses, and one
among them wore one of feather mosaic; his dress ornaments were of
jade, and his belt and sandals were studded with jade and gold, as
were his armlets and leglets; in his nose was a carved ornament,
which passed through a hole in the septum; his lip and earplugs
were likewise of jade. All the trappings of this man were more
gorgeous than those of his companions, for Xatl Din was a
noble.</p>

<p>The brown faces of all were tattooed, but the tattooing on Xatl
Din was by far the most elaborate. They were armed with bows and
arrows, and each carried two quivers; each also carried a spear,
and a sling to hurl stones. In addition to these weapons, each of
the warriors carried a long sword made of hard wood, into the sides
of which were set at intervals blades of obsidian. For protection,
they carried wooden shields covered with the skins of animals. They
watched the strangers for some time and then melted away into the
jungle behind them.</p>

<p>The ship's charts and instruments had been brought ashore, and
that noon Captain Bolton had sought to establish their position;
but when he had done so and had consulted the chart, he discovered
that there was no land within hundreds of miles in any
direction.</p>

<p>"There must have been something wrong with my calculations," he
said to de Groote; so they checked and double-checked, but the
result was always the same&mdash;they were somewhere in the middle
of the South Pacific, hundreds of miles from land.</p>

<p>"It can't be possible," said Bolton, "that there is an
undiscovered and uncharted island anywhere in the world."</p>

<p>"I should have said as much," agreed de Groote, "until now; your
figures are absolutely correct, sir, and we are on an uncharted
island."</p>

<p>"With about as much chance of ever being picked up," said
Bolton, "as we would be if we were on the moon. If no ship has
touched here since the days of da Gama, it is safe to assume that
no ship will touch here during the rest of our lifetime."</p>

<p>"If no ship has touched here in four hundred years," said de
Groote, "our chances are really excellent, for there has got to be
a first time you know; and the law of chance, that this island will
remain undiscovered, is just about run out."</p>

<p>"You mean the statutes of limitations will operate in our
favor," laughed Bolton. "Well, I hope you're right."</p>

<p>Tarzan had worked with the others. Comfortable shelters had been
erected for the Colonel and his wife and for the two girls.</p>

<p>Now Tarzan summoned the entire company. "I have called you
together," he said, "to say that we will form two camps. I will not
have Abdullah, Krause, Schmidt, Oubanovitch, or the Lascars in this
camp. They have caused all the trouble. Because of them we are
castaways on an uncharted island, where, according to Captain
Bolton, we may have to spend the rest of our lives. If we permit
them to remain in our camp, they will again make trouble; I know
the kind of men they are." Then he turned to Krause. "You will take
your party north, at least two long marches, and don't any of you
come within ten miles of this camp. If you do, I kill. That is all.
Go."</p>

<p>"We'll go, all right," said Oubanovitch, "but we'll take our
share of the provisions, firearms, and ammunition."</p>

<p>"You will take your lives, and that is all," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you're going to send them away into this
strange jungle without food or weapons," demanded the Colonel.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean," said Tarzan, "and they are lucky
that it is no worse."</p>

<p>"You can't do that to us," shouted Oubanovitch, "you can't keep
a lot of dirty Capitalists in affluence and grind down the poor
working man. I know your type, a fawning sycophant, hoping to curry
favor with the rich and powerful."</p>

<p>"My word!" exclaimed Algy, "the blighter's making a speech."</p>

<p>"Just like Hyde Park," said Patricia.</p>

<p>"That's right," screamed Oubanovitch; "the smart bourgeoisie
ridiculing the honest laboring man."</p>

<p>"Get out," growled Tarzan.</p>

<p>Abdullah pulled at Oubanovitch's sleeve. "You'd better come," he
whispered; "I know that fellow; he is a devil; he would rather kill
us than not."</p>

<p>The others started moving away towards the north, and they
dragged Oubanovitch along with them; but he turned and shouted
back, "I'll go, but I'll be back, when the poor slaves that are
working for you now realize that they should be the masters, not
you."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Penelope Leigh, "I'm glad that they are gone;
that is something, at least," and she cast a meaningful glance at
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Coconut palms and bananas grew in profusion in the jungle around
the camp, and there were breadfruit and edible tubers and a few
papaya trees, while the lagoon abounded in fish; so there was
little likelihood of their starving, but Tarzan craved flesh.</p>

<p>After the camp was completed, he set to work to make the weapons
of the chase which he liked best to use. His bow, arrows, and
quiver, he had to make himself; but among the ships stores, he
found a suitable knife and a rope and from a gaff, he fashioned a
spear. This last was a tacit acknowledgment of the presence of the
great carnivores he had turned loose upon the island. And then, one
morning, Tarzan disappeared from camp before the others had
awakened. He followed the course of the little stream that ran down
from the verdure-clad hills, but, to avoid the tangle of
underbrush, he swung through the trees.</p>

<p>I said that he had left camp before the others were awake; and
this was what Tarzan thought, but presently he sensed that he was
being followed and looking back, saw the two orangutans swinging
through the trees in his wake.</p>

<p>"Tarzan hunts," he said in the language of the great apes, when
they had come up to him; "make no noise."</p>

<p>"Tarzan hunts, mangani make no noise," one of them assured him.
And so the three of them swung silently through the trees of the
silent forest.</p>

<p>On the lower slopes of the mountains, Tarzan came upon the
elephants eating on tender shoots. He spoke to them, and they
rumbled a greeting in their throats. They were not afraid, and they
did not move away. Tarzan thought he would learn how friendly they
might be, and so he dropped down close beside a great African bull
and spoke to him in the language that he had used all his life when
conversing with his beloved Tantor.</p>

<p>It is not really a language, and I do not know what name to call
it by, but through it Tarzan could convey his feelings more than
his wishes to the great beasts that had been his play-fellows since
his childhood.</p>

<p>"Tantor," he said, and laid his hand upon the great beast's
shoulder. The huge bull swayed to and fro and reached back and
touched the ape-man with his trunk, an inquisitive, questioning
touch; and, as Tarzan spoke soothingly, the touch became a caress.
And then the ape-man moved around in front of the great beast and
laid his hand upon his trunk and said, "Nala!" The trunk moved
smoothly over his body, and Tarzan repeated, "Nala! Tantor, Nala!"
and then the trunk wound around him and lifted him in air.</p>

<p>"B'yat, Tantor," commanded Tarzan, "tand b'yat!" and the bull
lowered Tarzan to his head.</p>

<p>"Vando!" said Tarzan, and scratched the great beast behind his
ears.</p>

<p>The other elephants went on with their feeding, paying no
further attention to the ape-man, but the orangutans sat in a
nearby tree and scolded, for they were afraid of Tantor.</p>

<p>Now, Tarzan thought that he would try an experiment, and he
swung from the bull's back into a nearby tree and went off a little
distance into the jungle; then he called back, "Yud, Tantor, yud
b'yat."</p>

<p>Through the forest and the undergrowth came an answering rumble
from the throat of the bull. Tarzan listened; he heard the cracking
of twigs and the crashing of underbrush, and presently the great
bulk of Tantor loomed above him.</p>

<p>"Vando, Tantor," he said, and swung away through the trees, much
to the relief of the orangutans, who had looked with disfavor upon
this whole procedure.</p>

<p>The mountain rose steeply before them now, and there were often
places where only Tarzan or his simian friends might go. At last
the three came to a ledge that ran towards the south. It led away
from the stream, however, from which Tarzan had departed at the
foot of a waterfall which tumbled over a cliff, the precipitous and
slippery sides of which might have been negotiated by a fly or a
lizard but by little else.</p>

<p>They followed the ledge around a shoulder of the mountain and
came out upon a large level mesa dense with forest. It looked to
Tarzan like a good hunting ground, and here he again took to the
trees.</p>

<p>Presently, Usha, the wind, brought to his nostrils a familiar
scent&mdash;the scent of Horta, the boar. Here was meat, and
instantly Tarzan was the wild beast stalking its prey.</p>

<p>He had not gone far, however, before two other scents impinged
upon his sensitive nostrils&mdash;the scent spoor of Numa, the
lion, and mingled with it, that of man.</p>

<p>These two scent spoors could be mingled for but one of two
reasons: either the man was hunting the lion, or the lion was
hunting the man. And as Tarzan detected the scent of only a single
man, he assumed that the lion was the hunter, and so he swung off
through the trees, in the direction from which the scent came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-12" id="S3-12">CHAPTER XII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THAK CHAN was hunting no lion. It was impossible
that he could have been hunting a lion, for he had never seen or
heard of one in all his life; neither had any of his progenitors
through all recorded time. A long time ago, before Chac Tutul Xiu
had migrated from Yucatan, Thak Chan's people had known the jaguar,
and the memory of it had been carried across the great water to
this distant island and preserved in enduring stone in the temples
and upon the stelae that had been built here. Thak Chan was a
hunter from the city of Chichen Itza, that Chac Tutul Xiu had
founded upon this island which he had found and had named Uxmal for
the city of his birth.</p>

<p>Thak Chan was hunting the wild boar, which, if aroused, may be
quite as formidable as Numa, the lion; but, up to now, Thak Chan
had had no luck.</p>

<p>Thak Chan entered a small natural clearing in the forest, and as
he did so, his startled attention was attracted to the opposite
side by an ominous growl. Confronting him was the snarling face of
the most terrifying beast he had ever seen.</p>

<p>The great lion slunk slowly out into the clearing, and Thak Chan
turned and fled. The thunderous roar that followed him almost
paralyzed him with terror as he raced for his life through the
familiar mazes of the forest, while close behind the hungry lion
loped after its prey. There could have been no hope for Thak Chan
in that unequal race even if he had remained upon his feet; but
when he tripped and fell, he knew that it was the end. He turned to
face this fearsome, unknown creature; but he did not arise, and,
still sitting on the ground, he awaited the attack with poised
spear.</p>

<p>The lion appeared then from around a curve in the jungle trail.
His yellow-green eyes were round and staring. To Thak Chan, they
seemed burning with fires of fury. The beast's great yellow fangs
were bared in a snarl so malignant, that Thak Chan quailed anew.
The lion did not charge; he merely trotted towards his prey, for
here was only a puny man-thing&mdash;no worthy antagonist for the
King of Beasts.</p>

<p>Thak Chan prayed to strange gods as he saw death approaching;
and then, as though in answer to his prayers, an amazing thing
happened; a naked man, a giant to Thak Chan, dove from a tree above
the trail full upon the back of that savage beast for which Thak
Chan did not even have a name. A mighty arm went around the beast's
neck, and powerful legs wrapped around the small of its body. It
rose upon its hind legs roaring hideously, and sought to reach the
thing upon its back with fang or talon. It leaped into the air,
twisting and turning; it threw itself upon the ground and rolled
over in frantic effort to free itself; but the silent creature
clung to it tenaciously, and with its free hand, drove a long knife
again and again into its tawny side, until, with a final thunderous
roar, the beast rolled over upon its side, quivered convulsively
for a moment and lay still.</p>

<p>Thak Chan had watched this amazing battle with feelings of mixed
terror and hope, half convinced that this was indeed a god come to
save him, but almost as fearful of the god as of the beast.</p>

<p>As the great beast died, Thak Chan saw the man, or god, or
whatever it was, rise to his feet and place one of them upon the
body of his kill and then raise his face to the heavens and voice a
long drawn out scream so terrifying that Thak Chan shuddered and
covered his ears with his palms.</p>

<p>For the first time since it had risen from the floor of the
ocean the island of Uxmal heard the victory cry of a bull ape that
had made its kill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-13" id="S3-13">CHAPTER XIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THAK CHAN knew of many gods, and he tried to place
this one. He knew them as the mighty ones, the captains that go
before, and the old ones. There was Huitz-Hok, Lord Hills and
Valleys; Che, Lord Forest; and innumerable earth gods; then of
course there was Itzamna, ruler of the sky, son of Hunab Kuh, the
first god; and Hun Ahau, god of the underworld, Metnal, a cold,
dank, gloomy place beneath the earth, where the rank and file and
those who led evil lives went after death; and there was also
Aychuykak, god of war, who was always carried into battle by four
captains on a special litter.</p>

<p>Perhaps this one was Che, Lord Forest; and so Thak Chan
addressed him thus, and being polite, thanked him for saving him
from the strange beast. However, when Che replied, it was in a
language that Thak Chan had never heard before, and which he
thought perhaps was the language of the gods.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at the strange little brown man who spoke this
amazing language which he could not understand; then he said,
"Dako-zan," which in the language of the great apes means "meat;"
but Thak Chan only shook his head and apologized for being so
stupid.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was getting nowhere this way, Tarzan took an
arrow from his quiver and with its point drew a picture of Horta,
the boar, in the well-packed earth of the trail; then he fitted the
arrow to his bow and drove the shaft into the picture behind the
left shoulder.</p>

<p>Thak Chan grinned and nodded excitedly; then he motioned Tarzan
to follow him. As he started away along the trail, he chanced to
look up and see the two orangutans perched above him and looking
down at him. This was too much for the simple mind of Thak Chan;
first the strange and horrible beast, then a god, and now these two
hideous creatures. Trembling, Thak Chan fitted an arrow to his bow;
but when he aimed it at the apes, Tarzan snatched the weapon from
him, and called to the orangutans, which came down and stood beside
him.</p>

<p>Thak Chan was now convinced that these also were gods, and he
was quite overcome by the thought that he was consorting with three
of them. He wanted to hurry right back to Chichen Itza and tell
everybody he knew of the miraculous happenings of this day, but
then it occurred to him that nobody would believe him and that the
priests might become angry. He recalled, too, that men had been
chosen as victims of the sacrificial rites at the temple for much
less than this.</p>

<p>There must be some way. Thak Chan thought and thought as he led
Tarzan of the Apes through the forest in search of wild boar; and
at last he hit upon a magnificent scheme; he would lead the three
gods back to Chichen Itza that all men might see for themselves
that Thak Chan spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Tarzan thought that he was being led in search of Horta, the
boar; and when a turn in the trail brought them to the edge of the
jungle, and he saw an amazing city, he was quite as surprised as
Thak Chan had been when he had come to the realization that his
three companions were gods. Tarzan could see that the central part
of the city was built upon a knoll on the summit of which rose a
pyramid surmounted by what appeared to be a temple. The pyramid was
built of blocks of lava which formed steep steps leading to the
summit. Around the pyramid were other buildings which hid its base
from Tarzan's view; and around all this central portion of the city
was a wall, pierced occasionally by gates. Outside the wall were
flimsy dwellings of thatch, doubtless the quarters of the poorer
inhabitants of the city.</p>

<p>"Chichen Itza," said Thak Chan, pointing and beckoning Tarzan to
follow him.</p>

<p>With the natural suspicion of the wild beast which was almost
inherent with him, the ape man hesitated. He did not like cities,
and he was always suspicious of strangers, but presently curiosity
got the better of his judgment, and he followed Thak Chan toward
the city. They passed men and women working in fields where maize,
and beans, and tubers were being cultivated&mdash;a monument to the
perspicacity of Chac Tutul Xiu, who over four hundred years before,
had had the foresight to bring seeds and bulbs with him from
Yucatan.</p>

<p>The men and women in the fields looked up in amazement as they
saw Thak Chan's companions, but they were still more amazed when
Thak Chan announced proudly that they were Che, Lord Forest, and
two of the earth gods.</p>

<p>By this time, however, the nerves of the two earth gods had
endured all that they could; and these deities turned and scampered
off toward the jungle, lumbering along in the half stooping posture
of the great apes. Thak Chan called after them pleadingly, but to
no avail, and a moment later he watched them swing into the trees
and disappear.</p>

<p>By this time, the warriors guarding the gates they were
approaching had become very much interested and not a little
excited. They had summoned an officer, and he was awaiting Thak
Chan and his companion when they arrived before the gate. The
officer was Xatl Din, who had commanded the party of warriors that
had discovered the castaways upon the beach.</p>

<p>"Who are you," he demanded, "and whom do you bring to Chichen
Itza?"</p>

<p>"I am Thak Chan, the hunter," replied Tarzan's companion, "and
this is Che, Lord Forest, who saved me from a terrible beast that
was about to devour me. The two who ran away were earth gods. The
people of Chichen Itza must have offended them or they would have
come into the city."</p>

<p>Xatl Din had never seen a god, but he realized that there was
something impressive about this almost naked stranger who towered
high above him and his fellows, for Tarzan's height was accentuated
by the fact that the Maya are a small people; and compared with
them, he looked every inch a god. However, Xatl Din was not wholly
convinced, for he had seen strangers on the beach, and he guessed
that this might be one of them.</p>

<p>"Who are you who comes to Chichen Itza?" he demanded of Tarzan.
"If you are indeed Che, Lord Forest, give me some proof of it, that
Cit Coh Xiu, the king, and Chal Yip Xiu, the Ah Kin Mai, may
prepare to welcome you befittingly."</p>

<p>"Che, Lord Forest, does not understand our language, most noble
one," interposed Thak Chan; "he understands only the language of
the gods."</p>

<p>"The gods can understand all languages," said Xatl Din.</p>

<p>"I should have said that he would not debase himself by speaking
it," Thak Chan corrected himself. "Undoubtedly he understands all
that we say, but it would not be meet for a god to speak the
language of mortals."</p>

<p>"You know a great deal for a simple hunter," said Xatl Din
superciliously.</p>

<p>"Those whom the gods make friends with must be very wise," said
Thak Chan loftily.</p>

<p>Thak Chan had been feeling more and more important all along.
Never before had he had such a protracted conversation with a
noble, in fact he had seldom ever said more than, "Yes, most noble
one," or "No, most noble one." Thak Chan's assurance and the
impressive appearance of the stranger were, at last, too much for
Xatl Din, and he admitted them into the city, accompanying them
himself toward the temple which was a part of the king's
palace.</p>

<p>Here were warriors and priests and nobles resplendent in
feathers and jade; and to one of the nobles who was also a priest,
Xatl Din repeated the story that Thak Chan had told him.</p>

<p>Tarzan, finding himself surrounded by armed men, again became
suspicious, questioning the wisdom of his entry into this city
which might prove a trap from which he might find it difficult to
escape.</p>

<p>A noble had gone to inform Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest, that
one who claimed to be Che, Lord Forest, had come to visit him in
his temple.</p>

<p>Like most high priests, Chal Yip Xiu was a trifle skeptical
about the existence of gods; they were all right for the common
people, but a high priest had no need for them. As a matter of
fact, he considered himself as a personification of all the gods,
and his power in Chichen Itza lent color to this belief.</p>

<p>"Go fetch the hunter and his companion," he said to the noble
who had brought the message.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Tarzan of the Apes strode into the presence
of Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest of Chichen Itza, and with him were
Thak Chan, the hunter, and Xatl Din, the noble, with several of his
fellows, and a score of warriors and lesser priests.</p>

<p>When Chal Yip Xiu saw the stranger, he was impressed; and, to be
on the safe side, he addressed him respectfully; but when Xatl Din
told him that the god refused to speak the language of mortals, the
high priest became suspicious.</p>

<p>"You reported the presence of strangers on the beach," he said
to Xatl Din; "could not this be one of them?"</p>

<p>"It could, holy one," replied the noble.</p>

<p>"If this one is a god," said Chal Yip Xiu, "then the others must
all be gods. But you told me that their ship was wrecked and that
they were cast ashore."</p>

<p>"That is right, holy one," replied Xatl Din.</p>

<p>"Then they are only mortals," said the high priest, "for gods
would have controlled the winds and the waves, and their ship would
not have been wrecked."</p>

<p>"That, too, is true, most wise one," agreed Xatl Din.</p>

<p>"Then this man is no god," stated Chal Yip Xiu, "but he will
make an excellent sacrifice to the true gods. Take him away."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-14" id="S3-14">CHAPTER XIV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT this unlooked for turn of affairs, Thak Chan
was so shocked and astounded that, although he was only a poor
hunter, he dared raise his voice in protest to Chal Yip Xiu, the Ah
Kin Mai. "But, most holy one," he cried, "you should have seen the
things that he did. You should have seen the great beast which was
about to devour me, and how he leaped upon its back and killed it;
none but a god could have done such a thing. Had you seen all this
and the two earth gods that accompanied him, you would know that he
must indeed be Che, Lord Forest."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Chal Yip Xiu in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>"I am Thak Chan, the hunter," replied the now frightened man
meekly.</p>

<p>"Then stick to your hunting, Thak Chan," warned Chal Yip Xiu,
"or you will end upon the sacrificial block or in the waters of the
sacred well. Get you gone." Thak Chan went; he sneaked out like a
dog with its tail between its legs.</p>

<p>But when warriors laid hands upon Tarzan, that was a different
story. Although he had not understood Chal Yip Xiu's words, he had
known by the man's tone and demeanor that all was not well, and
when he had seen Thak Chan sneak away, he was doubly convinced of
it; and then warriors closed in and laid hands upon him.</p>

<p>The high priest had received him in a colonnade upon one side of
a peristyle, and Tarzan's keen eyes had quickly taken in the entire
scene immediately after he was ushered into the presence of the
high priest. He had seen the garden behind the row of columns and
the low buildings beyond the peristyle. What lay immediately beyond
these buildings he did not know, but he did know that the city wall
was not far away, and beyond the wall and the fields there was the
forest.</p>

<p>He shook off the detaining hands of the warriors and leaped to
the low platform where Chal Yip Xiu sat; and, hurling the high
priest aside, he leaped into the garden, crossed the peristyle at a
run and swarmed up the wall of the building beyond.</p>

<p>Warriors pursued him across the peristyle with imprecations and
arrows and stones from the slings they carried; but only the
imprecations reached him, and they were harmless.</p>

<p>He crossed the roof of the building and dropped into a street
beyond. There were people in the street, but they fell back in
terror as this bronze giant brushed them aside and trotted on
toward the city wall. At the end of this street was a gate, but it
was not the gate through which he had entered the city, and the
warriors stationed here knew nothing of him; to them he was only an
almost naked stranger, evidently a man of an alien race, and thus
an enemy who had no business within the walls of Chichen Itza; so
they tried to bar his way and arrest him, but Tarzan seized one of
them and holding him by the ankles used him as a club to force his
way through the other warriors and out of the gate.</p>

<p>He was free at last, but then he had never had any doubt but
that he would be free, for he looked with contempt upon these
little men, primitively armed. How could they hope to hold Tarzan,
Lord of the Jungle. Just then a stone from one of their slings
struck him on the back of the head; and he fell forward upon his
face, unconscious.</p>

<p>When Tarzan regained consciousness, he found himself in a wooden
cage in a room dimly lit by a single window. The walls of the room
were of beautifully dressed and fitted blocks of lava. The window
was about two feet square and was near the ceiling; there was also
a doorway in the room, closed by a heavy wooden door, which Tarzan
guessed was bolted upon the outside. He did not know what fate lay
in store for him, but he imagined that it would be most unpleasant,
for the face of Chal Yip Xiu had been cruel indeed, as had the
faces of many of the priests and nobles.</p>

<p>Tarzan tested the bars of his wooden cage and smiled. He knew
that he could walk out of that whenever he pleased but getting out
of the room might be another question; the window would have been
large enough had there not been two stone bars set in the opening;
the door looked very substantial.</p>

<p>The back wall of the cage was about two feet from the back wall
of the room. Upon this side, Tarzan ripped off two of the bars and
stepped out of the cage. He went at once to the door but could
neither open it nor force it; however, he waited patiently before
it with one of the broken bars of his cage in his hand&mdash;he
knew that someone would open that door eventually.</p>

<p>He did not know that he had been unconscious a long time and
that night had passed and that it was day again. Presently he heard
voices outside his cell; they grew in numbers and volume until he
knew that there was a great concourse of people there, and now he
heard the booming of drums and the throaty blasts of trumpets and
the sound of chanting.</p>

<p>As he was wondering what was going on outside in the city, he
heard the scraping of the bolt outside his door. He waited, the
broken bar held firmly in one hand; and then the door opened and a
warrior entered&mdash;a warrior to whom death came quickly and
painlessly.</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped into the doorway and looked out. Almost directly
in front of him, a priest stood in front of an altar across which a
girl was stretched upon her back; four men in long embroidered
robes and feather headdresses held her there, one at each leg and
one at each arm. The priest stood above her with knife of obsidian
raised above her breast.</p>

<p>Tarzan took in the whole picture at a glance. The girl meant
nothing to him; the death of a human being did not mean much to
him, he who had seen so many creatures die, and knew that death was
the natural consequence of life; but the cruelty and heartlessness
of the ceremony angered him, and he was imbued with a sudden desire
to thwart the authors of it, rather than with any humanitarian urge
to rescue the girl. The priest's back was toward him as he leaped
from his cell and snatched the knife from the upraised hand; then
he lifted the priest and hurled him against two of the lesser
priests who held the girl, breaking their holds and sending them
crashing to the temple floor. The other two priests he struck down
with his wooden club. The astounding performance left the onlookers
stunned and breathless, and no hand was raised to stop him as he
lifted the girl from the altar, slung her across one shoulder, and
leaped through the temple doorway.</p>

<p>Tarzan recalled the route by which he had been brought to the
palace temple, and he followed it back now out into the city, past
two astounded guards at the palace gate. They saw him disappear
into a side street; but they dared not desert their posts to follow
him, but almost immediately a howling mob surged past them in
pursuit of the stranger who had defiled their temple and snatched a
sacrifice from the altar of their god.</p>

<p>The city was practically deserted, for all the inhabitants had
gathered in the temple square to witness the sacrifice, and so
Tarzan ran unmolested and unobserved through the narrow, winding
side street of Chichen Itza. He ran swiftly, for he could hear the
howls of the pursuing mob, and he had no wish to be overtaken by
it.</p>

<p>The girl across his shoulder did not struggle to escape; she was
far too terrified. Snatched from death by this strange almost naked
giant, she could only apprehend what a terrible fate awaited her.
She had heard the story that Thak Chan had told, for it had spread
throughout the city; and she thought that perhaps this was indeed
Che, Lord Forest. The vaguest hint of such a possibility would have
so terrified little Itzl Cha that she could not have moved had she
wished to, for gods are very terrifying creatures and not to be
antagonized. If Che, Lord Forest, wished to carry her away, it
would be certain death to oppose him; that she knew, and so Itzl
Cha lay very quietly on the broad shoulder of her rescuer.</p>

<p>Tarzan could tell by the diminishing volume of the sounds of
pursuit that he had thrown the mob off his trail. He soon reached
the city wall at some distance from any gate. Alone he could have
gained the top; but burdened with the girl, he could not; so he
looked about him quickly for some means of scaling it.</p>

<p>Just inside the wall was a narrow street, about fifteen feet
wide, which was lined with buildings and sheds of different
heights, and here Tarzan saw his way. To reach the roof of a low
shed with the girl was no feat for the ape man, and from this shed
he went to the roof of a higher structure, and then to another
which was on a level with the top of the city wall.</p>

<p>Itzl Cha, who had kept her eyes tightly closed most of the time
now opened them again. She saw that Che, Lord Forest, had carried
her to the roof of a building. Now he was running swiftly across
the roof toward the narrow street which lay just within the wall.
He did not slacken his speed as he approached the edge of the roof;
and that made Itzl Cha close her eyes again very tightly, for she
knew that they both were going to be dashed to death on the
pavement in the street below.</p>

<p>At the edge of the roof, Tarzan leaped up and outward, alighting
on the top of the wall on the opposite side of the street. Below
him was the thatched roof of a laborer's hut, and to this he
leaped, and from there to the ground. A moment later, with Itzl Cha
gasping for breath, he was trotting across the cultivated fields
toward the forest.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-15" id="S3-15">CHAPTER XV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LIFE in the camp of the castaways was well ordered
and run along military lines, for Colonel Leigh had taken full
command. Lacking bugles, he had set up the ship's bell, which rang
at six o'clock each morning, a clanging imitation of reveille; it
summoned the company to mess three times a day, and announced
tattoo at nine, and taps at ten each night. Sentries guarded the
camp twenty-four hours each day, and working parties policed it, or
chopped wood, or gathered such natural foods as the jungle
afforded. It was indeed a model camp, from which fishing parties
rowed out upon the lagoon daily, and hunting parties went into the
forest in search of game, wherewith to vary the monotony of their
fruit and vegetable diet. It was the duty of the women to keep
their own quarters in order and do such mending as might be
required.</p>

<p>Tarzan's mysterious disappearance and protracted absence was the
subject of considerable conversation. "It is good riddance," said
Penelope Leigh. "Never, since I first saw that terrible creature,
have I felt safe until now."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can say such a thing," said her niece; "I
should feel very much safer were he here."</p>

<p>"One never knew when he might take it into his head to eat one,"
insisted Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>"I was shut up with him for days in that cage," said Janette
Laon; "and he never showed me even the slightest incivility, let
alone threatening to harm me."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" snorted Penelope, who had never as yet condescended to
recognize the existence of Janette, let alone speak to her. She had
made up her mind on first sight that Janette was a loose woman; and
when Penelope Leigh made up her mind, not even an act of Parliament
might change it ordinarily.</p>

<p>"Before he went away, he had been making weapons," recalled
Patricia, "and I suppose he went into the forest to hunt; perhaps a
lion or a tiger got him."</p>

<p>"Serve him right," snapped Mrs. Leigh. "The very idea of turning
all those wild beasts loose on this island with us. It will be a
miracle if we are not all devoured."</p>

<p>"He went out into the jungle without any firearms," mused
Janette Laon, half to herself; "I heard Colonel Leigh say that not
even a pistol was missing. Just think of going into that jungle
where he knew all those ferocious beasts were, and with only a gaff
and some homemade arrows and a bow."</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh hated to acknowledge any interest in Janette Laon's
conversation, but she couldn't resist the temptation of saying,
"He's probably a half-wit; most of these wild men are."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," said Janette Laon sweetly, "never having had
an occasion to associate with any."</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh sniffed, and Patricia turned her back to hide a
smile.</p>

<p>Algernon Wright-Smith, Captain Bolton, and Dr. Crouch were
hunting. They had gone northward into the jungle hoping to bring
fresh meat back to the camp. They were following a dim trail in the
damp earth of which the footprints of pig could occasionally be
identified, and these gave them hope and lured them on.</p>

<p>"Nasty place to meet a tusker," remarked Crouch.</p>

<p>"Rather," agreed Algy.</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Bolton, who was in advance.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Crouch.</p>

<p>"The pug of a tiger or a lion," replied Bolton; "fresh
too&mdash;the blighter must just have crossed the trail."</p>

<p>Crouch and Algy examined the imprint of the beast's pug in the
soft earth. "Tiger," said Crouch; "no doubt about it&mdash;I've
seen too many of them to be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Rotten place to meet old stripes," said Algy; "I&mdash;," a
coughing grunt interrupted him. "I say!" he exclaimed, "there's the
beggar now."</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Bolton.</p>

<p>"Off there to the left," said Crouch.</p>

<p>"Can't see a bloody thing," said Algy.</p>

<p>"I think we should go back," said Bolton; "we wouldn't have a
chance if that fellow charged; one of us would be sure to be
killed&mdash;maybe more."</p>

<p>"I think you're right," said Crouch; "I don't like the idea of
having that fellow between us and camp." There was a sudden
crashing in the underbrush a short distance from them.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Algy, "here he comes!" as he threw down his
gun and clambered into a tree.</p>

<p>The other men followed Algy's example and none too soon, for
they were scarcely out of harm's way when a great Bengal tiger
broke from cover and leaped into the trail. He stood looking around
for a moment, and then he caught sight of the treed men and
growled. His terrible yellow-green eyes and his snarling face were
turned up toward them.</p>

<p>Crouch commenced to laugh, and the other two men looked at him
in surprise. "I'm glad there was no one here to see that," he said;
"it would have been a terrible blow to British prestige."</p>

<p>"What the devil else could we do?" demanded Bolton. "You know as
well as I do that we didn't have a ghost of a show against him,
even with three guns."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Algy; "couldn't have got a sight of him to
fire at until he was upon us. Certainly was lucky for us there were
some trees we could climb in a hurry; good old trees; I always did
like trees."</p>

<p>The tiger came forward growling, and when he was beneath the
tree in which Algy was perched, he crouched and sprang.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Algy, climbing higher; "the beggar almost
got me."</p>

<p>Twice more the tiger sprang for one of them, and then he walked
back along the trail a short distance and lay down patiently.</p>

<p>"The beggar's got us dead to rights," said Bolton.</p>

<p>"He won't stay there forever," said Crouch.</p>

<p>Bolton shook his head. "I hope not," he said, "but they have an
amazing amount of patience; I know a chap who was treed by one all
night in Bengal."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, he couldn't do that, you know," objected Algy. "What
does he take us for&mdash;a lot of bally asses? Does he think we're
coming down there to be eaten up?"</p>

<p>"He probably thinks that when we are ripe, we'll fall off, like
apples and things."</p>

<p>"This is deucedly uncomfortable," said Algy after a while; "I'm
pretty well fed up with it. I wish I had my gun."</p>

<p>"It's right down there at the foot of your tree," said Crouch;
"why don't you go down and get it?"</p>

<p>"I say, old thing!" exclaimed Algy; "I just had a brainstorm.
Watch." He took off his shirt, commenced tearing it into strips
which he tied together, and when he had a long string of this he
made a slip noose at one end; then he came down to a lower branch
and dropped the noose down close to the muzzle of his gun, which,
because of the way in which the weapon had fallen, was raised a
couple of inches from the ground.</p>

<p>"Clever?" demanded Algy.</p>

<p>"Very," said Bolton. "The tiger is admiring your ingenuity; see
him watching you?"</p>

<p>"If that noose catches behind the sight, I can draw the bally
thing up here, and then I'll let old stripes have what for."</p>

<p>"You should have been an engineer, Algy," said Crouch.</p>

<p>"My mother wanted me to study for the Church," said Algy, "and
my father wanted me to go into the diplomatic corps&mdash;both make
me bored; so I just played tennis instead."</p>

<p>"And you're rotten at that," said Crouch, laughing.</p>

<p>"Righto, old thing!" agreed Algy. "Look! I have it."</p>

<p>After much fishing, the noose had slipped over the muzzle of the
gun, and as Algy pulled gently, it tightened below the sight; then
he started drawing the weapon up towards him.</p>

<p>He had it within a foot of his hand when the tiger leaped to his
feet with a roar and charged. As the beast sprang into the air
towards Algy, the man dropped everything and scrambled towards
safety, as the raking talons swept within an inch of his foot.</p>

<p>"Whe-e-ew!" exclaimed Algy, as he reached a higher branch.</p>

<p>"Now you've even lost your shirt," said Crouch.</p>

<p>The tiger stood looking up for a moment, growling and lashing
his tail, and then he went back and lay down again.</p>

<p>"I believe the beggar is going to keep us here all night," said
Algy.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-16" id="S3-16">CHAPTER XVI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">KRAUSE and his fellows had not gone two days march
from the camp of the castaways, as Tarzan had ordered them to do.
They had gone only about four miles up the coast, where they had
camped by another stream where it emptied into the ocean. They were
a bitter and angry company as they squatted disconsolately upon the
beach and ate the fruit that they had made the Lascars gather. They
sweated and fumed for a couple of days and made plans and
quarreled. Both Krause and Schmidt wished to command, and Schmidt
won out because Krause was the bigger coward and was afraid of the
madman. Abdullah Abu Nejm sat apart and hated them all. Oubanovitch
talked a great deal in a loud tone of voice and argued that they
should all be comrades and that nobody should command. By a single
thread of common interest were they held together&mdash;their
hatred of Tarzan, because he had sent them away without arms or
ammunition.</p>

<p>"We could go back at night and steal what we need," suggested
Oubanovitch.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that same thing, myself," said Schmidt.
"You go back now, Oubanovitch, and reconnoiter. You can hide in the
jungle just outside their camp and get a good lay of the land, so
that we shall know just where the rifles are kept."</p>

<p>"You go yourself," said Oubanovitch, "you can't order me
around."</p>

<p>"I'm in command," screamed Schmidt, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>Oubanovitch stood up too. He was a big hulking brute, much
larger than Schmidt. "So what!" he demanded.</p>

<p>"There's no sense in fighting among ourselves," said Krause.
"Why don't you send a Lascar?"</p>

<p>"If I had a gun this dirty Communist would obey me," Schmidt
grumbled, and then he called to one of the Lascar sailors. "Come
here, Chuldrup," he ordered.</p>

<p>The Lascar slouched forward, sullen and scowling. He hated
Schmidt; but all his life he had taken orders from white men, and
the habit was strong upon him.</p>

<p>"You go other camp," Schmidt directed; "hide in jungle; see
where guns, bullets kept."</p>

<p>"No go," said Chuldrup; "tiger in jungle."</p>

<p>"The hell you won't go," exclaimed Schmidt, and knocked the
sailor down. "I'll teach you." The sailor came to his feet, a
boiling cauldron of hate. He wanted to kill the white man, but he
was still afraid. "Now get out of here, you heathen dog," Schmidt
yelled at him, "and see that you don't come back until you find out
what you want to know." Chuldrup turned and walked away, and a
moment later the jungle closed behind him.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I say!" exclaimed Algy. "What's the blighter doing now?" The
tiger had arisen and was standing, ears forward, looking back along
the trail. He cocked his head on one side, listening.</p>

<p>"He hears something coming," said Bolton.</p>

<p>"There he goes," said Crouch, as the tiger slunk into the
underbrush beside the trail.</p>

<p>"Now's our chance," said Algy.</p>

<p>"He didn't go far," said Bolton; "he's right there; I can see
him."</p>

<p>"Trying to fool us," said Crouch.</p>

<p>Chuldrup was very much afraid; he was afraid of the jungle, but
he was more afraid to return to Schmidt without the information the
man wanted. He stopped for a moment to think the matter over;
should he go back and hide in the jungle for a while close to
Schmidt's camp and then when there had been time for him to fulfill
his mission go to Schmidt and make up a story about the location of
the guns and bullets?</p>

<p>Chuldrup scratched his head, and then the light of a great idea
broke upon him; he would go to the camp of the Englishmen, tell
them what Schmidt was planning, and ask them to let him remain with
them. That, he knew, was one of the best ideas that he had ever had
in his life; and so he turned and trotted happily along the
trail.</p>

<p>"Something is coming," whispered Crouch; "I can hear it," and a
moment later Chuldrup came trotting into view.</p>

<p>All three men shouted warnings simultaneously, but too late. As
the Lascar stopped amazed and looked up at them, momentarily
uncomprehending, a great tiger leaped from the underbrush and
rearing up above the terrified man seized him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>Chuldrup screamed; the great beast shook him and then turned and
dragged him off into the underbrush, while the three Englishmen,
horrified, looked on helplessly.</p>

<p>For a few moments they could hear the screams of the man
mingling with the growls of the tiger and then the screams
ceased.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Algy, "that was awful."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bolton, "but it's our chance; he won't bother
anything now that doesn't go near his kill."</p>

<p>Gingerly and quietly they descended to the ground, picked up
their rifles, and started back toward camp; but all three were
shaken by the tragedy they had witnessed.</p>

<p>In the camp the day's work was done; even Colonel Leigh could
find nothing more to keep the men busy.</p>

<p>"I must be getting old," he said to his wife.</p>

<p>"Getting?" she asked. "Are you just discovering it?"</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled indulgently; he was always glad when Penelope
was herself. Whenever she said anything pleasant or kindly he was
worried. "Yes," he continued, "I must be slipping; I can't think of
a damn thing for these men to do."</p>

<p>"It seems to me there should be plenty to do around here," said
Penelope; "I am always busy."</p>

<p>"I think the men deserve a little leisure," said Patricia;
"they've been working steadily ever since we've gotten here."</p>

<p>"There's nothing that breeds discontent more surely than
idleness," said the Colonel; "but I'm going to let them knock off
for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>Hans de Groote and Janette Laon were sitting together on the
beach talking.</p>

<p>"Life is funny," said the man. "Just a few weeks ago, I was
looking forward to seeing New York City for the first
time&mdash;young, fancy-free, and with three months pay in my
pocket; what a time I was planning there! And now here I am
somewhere in the Pacific Ocean on an island that no one ever heard
of&mdash;and that's not the worst of it."</p>

<p>"And what is the worst of it?" asked Janette.</p>

<p>"That I like it," replied de Groote.</p>

<p>"Like it!" she exclaimed. "But why do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Because you are here," he said.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in surprise. "I don't understand," she
said; "you certainly can't mean that the way it sounds."</p>

<p>"But I do, Janette," he said; "I&mdash;," his tanned face
flushed. "Why is it that those three words are so hard to say when
you mean them?"</p>

<p>She reached out and placed her hand on his. "You mustn't say
them," she said; "you mustn't ever say them&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You know what I have been&mdash;kicking around Singapore,
Saigon, Batavia."</p>

<p>"I love you," said Hans de Groote, and then Janette Laon burst
into tears; it had been long since she had cried except in anger or
disappointment.</p>

<p>"I won't let you," she said; "I won't let you."</p>

<p>"Don't you&mdash;love me a little, Janette?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you," she said; "I won't ever tell you."</p>

<p>De Groote pressed her hand and smiled. "You have told me," he
said.</p>

<p>And then they were interrupted by Patricia's voice crying, "Why,
Algy, where is your shirt?"</p>

<p>The hunters had returned, and the Europeans gathered around to
hear their story. When they had finished the Colonel harrumphed.
"That settles it," he said; "there will be no more hunting in the
jungle; no one would have a chance against a tiger or a lion in
that tangle of undergrowth."</p>

<p>"It's all your fault, William," snapped Mrs. Leigh; "you should
have taken complete command; you should not have permitted that
wildman to turn those beasts loose on us."</p>

<p>"I still think that it was quite the sporting thing to do," said
the Colonel, "and don't forget that it was quite as dangerous for
him as for us. As far as we know the poor devil may have been
killed by one of them already."</p>

<p>"And serve him quite right," said Mrs. Leigh; "anyone who will
run around the way he does in the presence of ladies has no
business to live&mdash;at least not among decent people."</p>

<p>"I think the fellow was just a little bit of all right," said
the Colonel, "and don't forget, Penelope, if it had not been for
him, we would probably be a great deal worse off than we are
now."</p>

<p>"Don't forget, Aunt Penelope, that he rescued you from the
Saigon."</p>

<p>"I am doing my best to forget it," said Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-17" id="S3-17">CHAPTER XVII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Itzl Cha realized that she was being carried
off toward the forest, she was not quite sure what her feelings
were. Back in Chichen Itza was certain death, for the gods could
not be lightly robbed of their victims; and, were she ever to
return, she knew that she would be again offered up in sacrifice.
What lay ahead she could not even guess; but Itzl Cha was young and
life was sweet; and perhaps Che, Lord Forest, would not kill
her.</p>

<p>When they reached the forest Che did an amazing thing: he leaped
to the low branch of a tree and then swung upward, carrying her
swiftly high above the ground. Now indeed was Itzl Cha
terrified.</p>

<p>Presently Che stopped and voiced a long drawn-out call&mdash;an
eerie cry that echoed through the forest; then he went on.</p>

<p>The girl had summoned sufficient courage to keep her eyes open,
but presently she saw something that made her wish to close them
again; however, fascinated, she continued to look at two grotesque
creatures swinging through the trees to meet them, jabbering as
they came.</p>

<p>Che replied in the same strange jargon, and Itzl Cha knew that
she was listening to the language of the gods, for these two must
indeed be the two earth gods of whom Thak Chan had spoken. When
these two reached Che, all three stopped and spoke to each other in
that language she could not understand. It was then that Itzl Cha
chanced to glance down at the ground into a little clearing upon
the edge of which they were, and there she saw the body of a
terrible beast; and she knew that it was the same one from which
Che had rescued Thak Chan, the hunter.</p>

<p>She wished that the skeptics in Chichen Itza could see all that
she had seen, for then they would know that these were indeed gods;
and they would be sorry and frightened because they had treated
Lord Forest as they had.</p>

<p>Her divine rescuer carried her to a mountain trail. And there he
set her down upon the ground and let her walk. Now she had a good
look at him; how beautiful he was! Indeed a god. The two earth gods
waddled along with them, and from being afraid Itzl Cha commenced
to be very proud when she thought of the company in which she was.
What other girl in Chichen Itza had ever walked abroad with three
gods?</p>

<p>Presently they came to a place where the trail seemed to end,
disappearing over the brink of a terrifying precipice; but Che,
Lord Forest, did not hesitate; he merely took Itzl Cha across that
broad shoulder again and clambered down the declivity with as great
ease as did the two earth gods.</p>

<p>However, Itzl Cha could not help but be terrified when she
looked down; and so she closed her eyes tightly and held her breath
and pressed her little body very close to that of Che, Lord Forest,
who had become to her something akin to a haven of refuge.</p>

<p>But at last they reached the bottom and once again Lord Forest
raised his voice. What he said sounded to Itzl Cha like "Yud,
Tantor, yud!" And that was exactly what it was: "Come, Tantor,
come!"</p>

<p>Very shortly, Itzl Cha heard a sound such as she had never heard
before&mdash;a sound that no other Mayan had ever heard: the
trumpeting of an elephant.</p>

<p>By this time, Itzl Cha thought that she had seen all the
miracles that there were to be seen in the world, but when a great
bull elephant broke through the forest, toppling the trees that
were in his path, little Itzl Cha screamed and fainted.</p>

<p>When Itzl Cha regained consciousness, she did not immediately
open her eyes. She was conscious of an arm about her, and that her
back was resting against a human body; but what caused that strange
motion, and what was that rough surface that she straddled with her
bare legs?</p>

<p>Fearfully, Itzl Cha opened her eyes; but she immediately
screamed and closed them again. She was sitting on the head of that
terrible beast she had seen!</p>

<p>Lord Forest was sitting behind her, and it was his arm that was
around her, preventing her from falling to the ground. The earth
gods were swinging along in the trees beside them; they seemed to
be scolding. It was all too much for little Itzl Cha; in a brief
hour or two, she had experienced a lifetime of thrills and
adventure.</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close. Lum Kip was preparing
dinner for the Europeans. This was not a difficult procedure; there
was fish to fry, and some tubers to boil. Fruit made up the balance
of the menu. Lum Kip was cheerful and happy; he liked to work for
the foreign devils; they treated him well, and the work was not
nearly as arduous as chopping wood.</p>

<p>The two girls in the party and most of the men were sitting on
the ground, talking over the events of the day, especially the
hunting trip which had ended in tragedy. Patricia wondered if they
would ever see Tarzan again, and that started them talking about
the wildman and his probable fate. The Colonel was in his hut
shaving, and his wife was sitting out in front of it with her
mending, when something attracted her attention, and, looking
toward the forest she voiced a single ear-piercing shriek and
fainted. Instantly everyone was on his feet; the Colonel, his face
half lathered, rushed from the hut.</p>

<p>Patricia Leigh-Burden cried, "Oh, my God, look!"</p>

<p>Coming out of the forest was a great bull elephant, and on its
neck sat Tarzan holding an almost naked girl in front of him; two
orangutans waddled along at a safe distance on one side. No wonder
Penelope Leigh had fainted. The elephant stopped a few paces
outside the forest; the sight of all these people was too much for
him, and he would come no farther. Tarzan, with the girl in his
arms, slipped to the ground, and, holding her by the hand, led her
toward the camp.</p>

<p>Itzl Cha felt that these must all be gods, but much of her fear
was gone now, for Lord Forest had offered her no harm, nor had the
earth gods, nor had that strange enormous beast on which she had
ridden through the forest.</p>

<p>Patricia Leigh-Burden looked questioningly and a little
suspiciously at the girl walking at Tarzan's side. One of the
sailors working nearby said to another, "That fellow is a fast
worker." Patricia heard it, and her lips tightened.</p>

<p>Tarzan was greeted by silence, but it was the silence of
surprise. The Colonel was working over his wife, and presently she
opened her eyes. "Where is he?" she whispered. "That creature! You
must get him out of camp immediately, William, he and that wanton
girl with him. Both of them together didn't have on enough clothes
to cover a baby decently. I suppose he went off somewhere and stole
a woman, an Indian woman at that."</p>

<p>"Oh, quiet, Penelope," said the Colonel, a little irritably;
"you don't know anything about it and neither do I."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better make it your business to find out," snapped
Mrs. Leigh. "I don't intend to permit Patricia to remain in the
same camp with such people, nor shall I remain."</p>

<p>Tarzan walked directly to Patricia Leigh-Burden. "I want you to
look after this girl," he said.</p>

<p>"I?" demanded Patricia haughtily.</p>

<p>"Yes, you," he replied.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the Colonel, still half lathered, "what is
the meaning of all this, sir?"</p>

<p>"There's a city to the south of us," said Tarzan, "a good-sized
city, and they have some heathen rites in which they sacrifice
human beings; this girl was about to be sacrificed, when I was
lucky enough to be able to take her away. She can't go back there
because of course they would kill her; so we'll have to look after
her. If your niece won't do it, I'm sure that Janette will."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll look after her," said Patricia; "who said that I
wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Put some clothes on the thing," said Mrs. Leigh; "this is
absolutely disgraceful."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at her with disgust. "It is your evil mind that
needs clothes," he said.</p>

<p>Penelope Leigh's jaws dropped. She stood there open-mouthed and
speechless for a moment; then she wheeled about and stamped into
her hut.</p>

<p>"I say, old thing," said Algy, "how the deuce did you get that
elephant to let you ride on his head; that was one of the wild
African bulls?"</p>

<p>"How do you get your friends to do you favors?" asked
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But, I say, you know, old thing, I haven't any friends like
that."</p>

<p>"That is too bad," said the ape man. Then he turned to the
Colonel, "We must take every precaution against attack;" he said;
"there were many warriors in that city, and I have no doubts but
that a search will be made for this girl; eventually they will find
our camp. Of course they are not accustomed to firearms, and if we
are always on the alert, we have little to fear; but I suggest that
only very strong parties be allowed to go into the jungle."</p>

<p>"I have just issued orders that no one is to go into the
jungle," replied the Colonel. "Captain Bolton, Dr. Crouch, and Mr.
Wright-Smith were attacked by one of your tigers today."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-18" id="S3-18">CHAPTER XVIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FOR six weeks the life in the camp dragged on
monotonously and without incident; and during that time, Patricia
Leigh-Burden taught Itzl Cha to speak and understand enough English
so that the little Mayan girl could carry on at least a sketchy
conversation with the others, while Tarzan devoted much of his time
to learning the Maya tongue from her. Tarzan, alone of the company,
ventured occasionally into the jungle; and, from these excursions,
he often returned with a wild pig.</p>

<p>His absence from camp always aroused Penelope Leigh's ire. "He
is impudent and insubordinate," she complained to her husband. "You
gave strict orders that no one was to go into the jungle, and he
deliberately disobeys you. You should make an example of him."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest that I do with him, my dear?" asked the
Colonel. "Should he be drawn and quartered, or merely shot at
sunrise?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to be facetious, William; it does not become you. You
should simply insist that he obey the regulations that you have
laid down."</p>

<p>"And go without fresh pork?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I do not like pork," snapped Mrs. Leigh. "Furthermore, I do not
like the goings-on around this camp; Mr. de Groote is far too
intimate with that French woman, and the wildman is always around
that Indian girl. Look at them now&mdash;always talking together; I
can imagine what he is saying to her."</p>

<p>"He is trying to learn her language," explained the Colonel;
"something that may prove very valuable to us later on, if we ever
have any dealings with her people."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" snorted Mrs. Leigh; "a fine excuse. And the way they
dress! If I can find some goods in the ship's stores, I shall make
her a Mother Hubbard; and as for him&mdash;you should do something
about that. And now look; there goes Patricia over to talk to them.
William, you must put a stop to all this nonsense&mdash;it is
indecent."</p>

<p>Colonel William Cecil Hugh Percival Leigh sighed; his was not an
entirely happy existence. Many of the men were becoming restless,
and there were some who had commenced to question his right to
command them. He rather questioned it himself, but he knew that
conditions would become unbearable if there were no one in
authority. Of course Algy, Bolton, Tibbet, and Crouch backed him
up, as did de Groote and Tarzan. It was upon Tarzan that he
depended most, for he realized that here was a man who would brook
no foolishness in the event of mutiny. And now his wife wanted him
to insist that this half-savage man wear trousers. The Colonel
sighed again.</p>

<p>Patricia sat down beside Tarzan and Itzl Cha. "How goes the
class in Mayan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Itzl Cha says that I am doing splendidly," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And Itzl Cha is mastering English, after a fashion," said
Patricia; "she and I can almost carry on an intelligent
conversation. She has told me some very interesting things. Do you
know why they were going to sacrifice her?"</p>

<p>"To some god, I suppose," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, to a god called Che, Lord Forest, to appease him for the
affront done him by a man that claimed you were Che, Lord
Forest.</p>

<p>"Itzl Cha is, of course, positive that she was rescued by no one
less than Che, Lord Forest; and she says that many of her people
will believe that too. She says that it is the first time in the
history of her people that a god has come and taken alive the
sacrifice being offered to him. It has made a deep impression on
her and no one can ever convince her that you are not Che.</p>

<p>"Her own father offered her as a sacrifice in order to win favor
with the gods," continued Patricia. "It is simply horrible, but it
is their way; Itzl Cha says that parents often do this; although
slaves and prisoners of war are usually the victims."</p>

<p>"She has told me a number of interesting things about her people
and about the island," said Tarzan. "The island is called Uxmal,
after a city in Yucatan from which her people migrated hundreds of
years ago."</p>

<p>"They must be Mayans then," said Patricia.</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," said Dr. Crouch, who had joined
them. "From what you have told us of your experiences in their
city, and from what Itzl Cha has told us, it is evident that they
have preserved their religion and their culture almost intact
throughout the centuries since the migration. What a field this
would be for the anthropologist and the archaeologist. If you could
establish friendly relations with them, we might be able to solve
the riddles of the hieroglyphs on their stelae and temples in
Central America and South America."</p>

<p>"As the chances are that we shall be here all the rest of our
lives," Patricia reminded him, "our knowledge would do the world
very little good."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that we shall never be rescued," said Dr.
Crouch. "By the way, Tarzan, is this village that you visited the
only one on the island?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as to that," replied the ape man, "but these
Mayans are not the only people here. At the northern end of the
island, there is a settlement of what Itzl Cha calls 'very bad
people.' The history of the island, handed down largely by word of
mouth, indicates that survivors of a shipwreck intermarried with
the aborigines of the island, and it is their descendants who live
in this settlement; but they do not fraternize with the aborigines
who live in the central part of the island."</p>

<p>"You mean that there is a native population here?" asked Dr.
Crouch.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we are camped right on the south-western edge of their
domain. I have never gone far enough into their country to see any
of them, but Itzl Cha says that they are very savage
cannibals."</p>

<p>"What a lovely place fate selected for us to be marooned,"
remarked Patricia, "and then to make it all the cozier, you had to
turn a lot of lions and tigers loose in it." Tarzan smiled.</p>

<p>"At least we shall not perish from ennui," remarked Janette
Laon.</p>

<p>Colonel Leigh, Algy, and Bolton sauntered up, and then de Groote
joined the party. "Some of the men just came to me," said the
Dutchman, "and wanted me to ask you, Colonel, if they could try to
break up the Saigon and build a boat to get away from here. They
said they would rather take a chance of dying at sea than spending
the rest of their lives here."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can blame them," said the Colonel. "What do
you think of it, Bolton?"</p>

<p>"It might be done," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"Anyway, it will keep them busy," said the Colonel; "and if they
were doing something they wanted to do, they wouldn't be
complaining all the time."</p>

<p>"I don't know where they would build it," said Bolton. "They
certainly can't build it on the reef; and it wouldn't do any good
to build it on shore, for the water in the lagoon would be too
shallow to float it."</p>

<p>"There is deep water in a cove about a mile north of here," said
Tarzan, "and no reef."</p>

<p>"By the time the blighters have taken the Saigon apart," said
Algy, "and carried it a mile along the coast, they'll be too
exhausted to build a boat."</p>

<p>"Or too old," suggested Patricia.</p>

<p>"Who's going to design the boat?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"The men have asked me to," replied de Groote; "my father is a
shipbuilder, and I worked in his yard before I went to sea."</p>

<p>"It's not a bad idea," said Crouch; "do you think you can build
a boat large enough to take us all?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon how much of the Saigon we can salvage," replied
de Groote. "If we should have another bad storm soon, the whole
ship might break up."</p>

<p>Algernon Wright-Smith made a sweeping gesture toward the forest.
"We have plenty of lumber there," he said, "if the Saigon fails
us."</p>

<p>"That would be some job," said Bolton.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got all our lives to do it in, old thing," Algy
reminded him.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-19" id="S3-19">CHAPTER XIX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN two days had passed and Chuldrup had not
returned, Schmidt drove another Lascar into the forest with orders
to go to Tarzan's camp and get information about the guns and
ammunition.</p>

<p>The Lascars had made a separate camp, a short distance from that
occupied by Schmidt, Krause, Oubanovitch, and the Arab. They had
been very busy, but none of the four men in the smaller camp had
paid any attention to them, merely summoning one of them when they
wanted to give any orders.</p>

<p>The second man whom Schmidt had sent in the forest never
returned. Schmidt was furious, and on the third day he ordered two
men to go. They stood sullenly before him, listening. When he had
finished they turned and walked back to their own camp. Schmidt
watched them; he saw them sit down with their fellows. He waited a
moment to see if they would start, but they did not. Then he
started toward their camp, white with rage.</p>

<p>"I'll teach them," he muttered; "I'll show them who's boss
here&mdash;the brown devils;" but when he approached them, fifteen
Lascars stood up to face him, and he saw that they were armed with
bows and arrows and wooden spears. This was the work that had kept
them so busy for several days.</p>

<p>Schmidt and the Lascars stood facing one another for several
moments; then one of the latter said, "What do you want here?"</p>

<p>There were fifteen of them, fifteen sullen, scowling men, all
well armed.</p>

<p>"Aren't you two men going to find out about the guns and
ammunition so that we can get them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said one of the two. "You want to know, you go. We no take
orders any more. Get out. Go back to your own camp."</p>

<p>"This is mutiny," blustered Schmidt.</p>

<p>"Get out," said a big Lascar, and fitted an arrow to his
bow.</p>

<p>Schmidt turned and slunk away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Krause, when Schmidt reached his own
camp.</p>

<p>"The devils have mutinied," replied Schmidt, "and they are all
armed&mdash;made bows and arrows and spears for themselves."</p>

<p>"The uprising of the proletariat!" exclaimed Oubanovitch. "I
shall join them and lead them. It is glorious, glorious; the world
revolution has reached even here!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said Schmidt; "you give me a pain."</p>

<p>"Wait until I organize my glorious revolutionaries," cried
Oubanovitch; "then you will sing a different song; then it will be
'Comrade Oubanovitch, this,' and 'Comrade Oubanovitch, that.' Now I
go to my comrades who have risen in their might and cast the yoke
of Capitalism from their necks."</p>

<p>He crossed jubilantly to the camp of the Lascars. "Comrades!" he
cried. "Congratulations on your glorious achievement. I have come
to lead you on to greater victories. We will march on the camp of
the Capitalists who threw us out. We will liquidate them, and we
will take all their guns and ammunition and all their
supplies."</p>

<p>Fifteen scowling men looked at him in silence for a moment; then
one of them said, "Get out."</p>

<p>"But!" exclaimed Oubanovitch, "I have come to join you; together
we will go on to glorious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out," repeated the Lascar.</p>

<p>Oubanovitch hesitated until several of them started toward him;
then he turned and went back to the other camp. "Well, Comrade,"
said Schmidt, with a sneer, "is the revolution over?"</p>

<p>"They are stupid fools," said Oubanovitch.</p>

<p>That night the four men had to attend to their own fire, which
the Lascars had kept burning for them in the past as a safeguard
against wild beasts; and they had had to gather the wood for it,
too. Now it devolved upon them to take turns standing guard.</p>

<p>"Well, Comrade," said Schmidt to Oubanovitch, "how do you like
revolutions now that you are on the other side of one?"</p>

<p>The Lascars, having no white man to command them, all went to
sleep and let their fire die out. Abdullah Abu Nejm was on guard in
the smaller camp when he heard a series of ferocious growls from
the direction of the Lascar's camp, and then a scream of pain and
terror. The other three men awoke and sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Schmidt</p>

<p>"El adrea, Lord of the Broad Head," replied the Arab.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Oubanovitch.</p>

<p>"A lion," said Krause; "he got one of them."</p>

<p>The screams of the unfortunate victim were still blasting the
silence of the night, but they were farther from the camp of the
Lascars now, as the lion dragged his prey farther away from the
presence of the other men. Presently the screams ceased, and then
came an even more grisly and horrifying sound&mdash;the tearing and
rending of flesh and bones mingled with the growls of the
carnivore.</p>

<p>Krause piled more wood upon the fire. "That damn wildman," he
said&mdash;"turning those beasts loose here."</p>

<p>"Serves you right," said Schmidt; "you had no business catching
a white man and putting him in a cage."</p>

<p>"It was Abdullah's idea," whined Krause; "I never would have
thought of it if he hadn't put it into my head."</p>

<p>There was no more sleep in the camp that night. They could hear
the lion feeding until daylight, and then in the lesser darkness of
dawn, they saw him rise from his kill and go to the river to drink;
then he disappeared into the jungle.</p>

<p>"He will lie up for the day," said Abdullah, "but he will come
out again and feed."</p>

<p>As Abdullah ceased speaking, a foul sound came from the edge of
the jungle, and two forms slunk out; the hyenas had scented the
lion's kill, and presently they were tearing at what was left of
the Lascar.</p>

<p>The next night, the Lascars built no fire at all; and another
was taken. "The fools!" exclaimed Krause; "that lion has got the
habit by now, and none of us will ever be safe again here."</p>

<p>"They are fatalists." said Schmidt; "they believe that whatever
is foreordained to happen must happen, and that nothing they can do
about it can prevent it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm no fatalist," said Krause. "I'm going to sleep in a
tree after this," and he spent the next day building a platform in
a tree at the edge of the forest, setting an example which the
other three men were quick to follow. Even the Lascars were
impressed, and that night the lion came and roared through empty
camps.</p>

<p>"I've stood all of this that I can," said Krause; "I'm going
back and see that fellow, Tarzan. I'll promise anything if he'll
let us stay in his camp."</p>

<p>"How are you going to get there?" asked Schmidt. "I wouldn't
walk through that jungle again for twenty million marks."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to walk through the jungle," said Krause. "I'm
going to follow the beach. I could always run out into the ocean if
I met anything."</p>

<p>"I think El adrea would be kinder to us than Tarzan of the
Apes," said the Arab.</p>

<p>"I never did anything to him," said Oubanovitch; "he ought to
let me come back."</p>

<p>"He's probably afraid you'd start a revolution," said Schmidt.
But they finally decided to try it; and early the next morning,
they set out along the beach toward the other camp.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-20" id="S3-20">CHAPTER XX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CHAND, the Lascar, watched Krause and his three
companions start along the beach in the direction of Camp Saigon.
"They are going to the other camp," he said to his fellows. "Come,
we will go too," and a moment later they were trailing along the
beach in the wake of the others.</p>

<p>In Camp Saigon, Tarzan was eating his breakfast alone. He had
arisen early, for he had planned a full day's work. Only Lum Kip
was astir, going about his work quietly preparing breakfast.
Presently Patricia Leigh-Burden came from her hut and joined
Tarzan, sitting down beside him.</p>

<p>"You are up early this morning," she said.</p>

<p>"I am always earlier than the others," he replied, "but today I
had a special reason; I want to get an early start."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going exploring," he replied, "I want to see what is on the
other side of the island."</p>

<p>Patricia leaned forward eagerly, placing a hand upon his knee.
"Oh, may I go with you?" she asked. "I'd love it."</p>

<p>From the little shelter that had been built especially for her,
Itzl Cha watched them. Her black eyes narrowed and snapped, and she
clenched her little hands tightly.</p>

<p>"You couldn't make it, Patricia," said Tarzan, "not the way I
travel."</p>

<p>"I've hiked through jungles in India," she said.</p>

<p>"No;" he said, quite definitely; "traveling on the ground in
there is too dangerous. I suppose you've heard it mentioned that
there are wild animals there."</p>

<p>"Then if it's dangerous you shouldn't go," she said, "carrying
nothing but a silly bow and some arrows. Let me go along with a
rifle; I'm a good shot, and I've hunted tigers in India."</p>

<p>Tarzan rose, and Patricia jumped to her feet, placing her hands
on his shoulders. "Please don't go," she begged, "I'm afraid for
you," but he only laughed and turned and trotted off toward the
jungle.</p>

<p>Patricia watched him until he swung into a tree and disappeared;
then she swished around angrily and went to her hut. "I'll show
him," she muttered under her breath.</p>

<p>Presently she emerged with a rifle and ammunition. Itzl Cha
watched her as she entered the jungle at the same place that Tarzan
had, right at the edge of the little stream. The little Mayan girl
bit her lips, and the tears came to her eyes&mdash;tears of
frustration and anger. Lum Kip, working around the cook fire,
commenced to hum to himself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest, was still furious about the theft
of Itzl Cha from beneath the sacred sacrificial knife. "The temple
has been defiled," he growled, "and the gods will be furious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Cit Coh Xiu, the king; "perhaps after all
that was indeed Che, Lord Forest."</p>

<p>Chal Yip Xiu looked at the king, disgustedly. "He was only one
of the strangers that Xatl Din saw on the beach. If you would not
arouse the anger of the gods, you should send a force of warriors
to the camp of the strangers, to bring Itzl Cha back, for that is
where she will be found."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said the king; "at least it will do no
harm," and he sent for Xatl Din and ordered him to take a hundred
warriors and go to the camp of the strangers and get Itzl Cha.
"With a hundred warriors, you should be able to kill many of them
and bring back prisoners to Chichen Itza."</p>

<hr>

<p>Tibbett, with a boatload of sailors, was rowing out to the reef
to continue the work of salvaging lumber from the Saigon, as the
other members of the party came out for their breakfast. Itzl Cha
sat silent and sullen, eating very little, for she had lost her
appetite. Janette Laon came and sat beside de Groote, and Penelope
Leigh looked at them down her nose.</p>

<p>"Is Patricia up yet, Janette?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>Janette looked around the company. "Why, yes," she said, "isn't
she here? She was gone when I woke up."</p>

<p>"Where in the world can that girl be?" demanded Penelope
Leigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, she must be nearby," said the Colonel, but, as he called
her name aloud, it was evident that he was perturbed.</p>

<p>"And that creature is gone too!" exclaimed Mrs. Leigh. "I knew
that something terrible like this was going to happen sooner or
later, William, if you permitted that man to remain in camp."</p>

<p>"Now, just what has happened, Penelope?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Why he's abducted her, that's what's happened."</p>

<p>Lum Kip, who was putting a platter of rice on the table,
overheard the conversation and volunteered, "Tarzan, she, go that
way," pointing toward the northeast; "Plateecie, him go that way,"
and pointed in the same direction.</p>

<p>"Maybe Pat abducted him," suggested Algy.</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Algernon," snapped Mrs. Leigh. "It is
quite obvious what happened&mdash;the creature enticed her into the
jungle."</p>

<p>"They talked long," said Itzl Cha, sullenly. "They go different
times; they meet in jungle."</p>

<p>"How can you sit there, William, and permit that Indian girl to
intimate that your niece arranged an assignation in the jungle with
that impossible creature."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Colonel, "if Pat's in the jungle, I pray to
high heaven that Tarzan is with her."</p>

<hr>

<p>Pat followed a stream that ran for a short distance in a
northeasterly direction, and when it turned southeast, she
continued to follow it, not knowing that Tarzan had taken to the
trees and was swinging rapidly through them almost due east toward
the other side of the island. The ground rose rapidly now, and the
little stream tumbled excitedly down toward the ocean. Pat realized
that she was being a stubborn fool, but, being stubborn, she
decided to climb the mountain a short distance to get a view of the
island. It was a hard climb, and the trees constantly shut out any
view, but the girl kept on until she came to a level ledge which
ran around a shoulder of the mountain. As she was pretty well
winded by this time, she sat down to rest.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I should think some of you men would go out and look for
Patricia," said Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Algy, "but I don't know where to look for the
old girl."</p>

<p>"Who's that coming along the beach?" said Dr. Crouch.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Krause and Schmidt," said Bolton. "Yes, and
Oubanovitch and the Arab are with him." Almost automatically the
men loosened their pistols in their holsters and waited in silence
as the four approached.</p>

<p>The men about the breakfast table had all risen and were waiting
expectantly. Krause came to the point immediately. "We've come to
ask you to let us come back and camp near you," he said. "We have
no firearms and no protection where we are. Two of our men have
gone into the jungle and never returned, and two have been taken
right out of camp by lions at night. You certainly must have a
heart, Colonel; you certainly won't subject fellow men to such
dangers needlessly. If you will take us back, we promise to obey
you and not cause any trouble."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it will cause a lot of trouble when Tarzan returns
and finds you here," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"You should let them remain, William," said Mrs. Leigh. "You are
in command here, not that Tarzan creature."</p>

<p>"I really think it would be inhuman to send them away," said Dr.
Crouch.</p>

<p>"They were inhuman to us," said Janette Laon bitterly.</p>

<p>"Young woman," exploded Penelope, "you should be taught your
place; you have nothing to say about this. The Colonel will
decide."</p>

<p>Janette Laon shook her head hopelessly and winked at de Groote.
Penelope saw the wink and exploded again. "You are an insolent
baggage," she said; "you and the Indian girl and that Tarzan
creature should never have been permitted in the same camp with
gentlefolk."</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, Penelope," said the Colonel stiffly, "I
think that I can handle this matter without assistance or at least
without recrimination."</p>

<p>"Well, all that I have to say," said Penelope, "is that you must
let them remain."</p>

<p>"Suppose," suggested Crouch, "that we let them remain anyway
until Tarzan returns; then we can discuss the matter with
him&mdash;they are more his enemies than ours."</p>

<p>"They are enemies to all of us," said Janette.</p>

<p>"You may remain, Krause," said the Colonel, "at least, until
Tarzan returns; and see that you behave yourselves."</p>

<p>"We certainly shall, Colonel," replied Krause, "and thank you
for letting us stay."</p>

<p>Patricia got a view of the ocean from the ledge where she was
sitting, but she could see nothing of the island; and so, after
resting, she went on a little farther. It was far more open here
and very beautiful, orchids clung in gorgeous sprays to many a
tree, and ginger and hibiscus grew in profusion; birds with yellow
plumage and birds with scarlet winged from tree to tree. It was an
idyllic, peaceful scene which soothed her nerves and obliterated
the last vestige of her anger.</p>

<p>She was glad that she had found this quiet spot and was
congratulating herself, and planning that she would come to it
often, when a great tiger walked out of the underbrush and faced
her. The tip of his tail was twitching nervously, and his snarling
muscles had drawn his lips back from his great yellow fangs.</p>

<p>Patricia Leigh-Burden breathed a silent prayer as she threw her
rifle to her shoulder and fired twice in rapid succession.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-21" id="S3-21">CHAPTER XXI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"I CERTAINLY do not like the idea of having those
men around here all the time," said Janette; "I am afraid of them,
especially Krause."</p>

<p>"I'll look after him," said de Groote. "Let me know if he ever
makes any advances."</p>

<p>"And now look!" exclaimed Janette, pointing along the beach.
"Here come all those Lascars back, too. Those fellows give me the
creeps."</p>

<p>As she ceased speaking, the report of two rifle shots came
faintly but distinctly to their ears. "That must be Patricia!"
exclaimed the Colonel. "She must be in trouble."</p>

<p>"She has probably had to shoot that creature," said Penelope
hopefully.</p>

<p>The Colonel had run to his hut and gotten his rifle; and when he
started in the direction from which the sound of the shot had come,
he was followed by de Groote, Algy, Crouch, and Bolton.</p>

<p>As the foliage of the jungle closed about Bolton's back, Schmidt
turned to Krause and grinned. "What's funny?" demanded the
latter.</p>

<p>"Let's see what we can find in the way of rifles and
ammunition," said Schmidt to the other three men. "This looks like
our day."</p>

<p>"What are you men doing?" demanded Penelope Leigh. "Don't you
dare go into those huts."</p>

<p>Janette started to run toward her hut to get her rifle, but
Schmidt overtook her and hurled her aside. "No funny business," he
warned.</p>

<p>The four men collected all the remaining firearms in the camp
and then at pistol points forced the Lascars to load up with such
stores as Schmidt desired.</p>

<p>"Pretty good haul," he said to Krause. "I think we've got about
everything we want now."</p>

<p>"Maybe you have, but I haven't," replied the animal collector;
then he walked over to Janette. "Come along, sweetheart," he said;
"we're going to start all over again right where we left off."</p>

<p>"Not I," said Janette, backing away.</p>

<p>Krause seized one of her arms. "Yes, you; and if you know what's
good for you, you'd better not make any trouble."</p>

<p>The girl tried to pull away, and Krause struck her. "For
heaven's sake, go along with him," cried Penelope Leigh. "Don't
make a scene; I hate scenes. Anyway, you belong with him; you
certainly have never belonged in my camp."</p>

<p>Half-stunned by the blow, Janette was dragged away; and the
Colonel's wife watched them start back along the beach in the
direction from which they had come.</p>

<p>"The Colonel shall hear about your stealing our stores, you
scoundrels," she called after them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Xatl Din and his hundred warriors came through the forest spread
out in open order, that they might leave no well-marked trail; and
as they came, they heard two sharp, loud sounds which seemed to
come from but a short distance ahead of them. None of these men had
ever heard the report of a firearm before, and so they had no idea
of what it was. They crept cautiously forward, their eyes and ears
constantly alert. Xatl Din was in the lead, and as he came to a
more open place in the forest, he stopped suddenly, for a strange
and unaccustomed sight met his eye. On the ground lay a huge,
striped beast, such as he had never seen before. It was evidently
dead, and above it stood a figure strangely garbed, who held a long
black shiny thing that was neither bow, arrow, nor spear.</p>

<p>Presently Xatl Din realized that the creature was a woman; and,
being an intelligent man, he surmised that the noise he had heard
had come from that strange thing she held, and that with it, she
had doubtless killed the huge beast which lay at her feet. Xatl Din
further reasoned that if she could have killed so large and
evidently ferocious an animal, she could even more easily kill men;
and, therefore, he did not come out into the open, but withdrew and
gave whispered instructions to his men.</p>

<p>Now the Mayans slipped silently around through the jungle until
they had encircled Patricia, and then while Xatl Din beat on a tree
with his sword to make a noise that would attract the girl's
attention in his direction, two of his men slipped out of the
jungle behind her, and crept noiselessly toward her.</p>

<p>As Patricia stood looking in the direction from which the sound
had come, listening intently, arms were thrown around her from
behind and her rifle was snatched from her hands; then a hundred
strangely garbed warriors, resplendent in feathered headdresses and
embroidered loin-cloths came running from the jungle to surround
her.</p>

<p>Patricia recognized these men immediately, not only from the
descriptions she had had from Itzl Cha and Tarzan, but also because
she had read a great deal concerning the civilization of the
ancient Mayans. She was as familiar with their civilization, their
religion, and their culture as the extensive research of many
archaeological expeditions had been able to bring to light. It
seemed to her that she had been suddenly carried back centuries to
a long dead past, to which these little brown men belonged. She
knew what her capture meant to her, for she knew the fate of Mayan
prisoners. Her only hope lay in the possibility that the men of her
party might be able to rescue her, and that hope was strong because
of her faith in Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" she said in the broken Mayan
she had learned from Itzl Cha.</p>

<p>"That is for Cit Coh Xiu to decide," he said. "I shall send you
back to Chichen Itza, back to the palace of the king." Then he
instructed four of his warriors to take the prisoner to Cit Coh
Xiu.</p>

<p>As Patricia was led away, Xatl Din and his remaining warriors
continued on in the direction of Camp Saigon. The noble was quite
pleased with himself. Even if he were not successful in bringing
Itzl Cha back to Chichen Itza, he had at least furnished another
sacrifice in her stead, and he would doubtless be praised by both
the king and the high priest.</p>

<hr>

<p>Colonel Leigh and his companions followed, quite by accident,
the same trail by which Patricia had come. They climbed the ledge
which ran around the shoulder of the mountain and, although badly
winded, kept on almost at a run. Their advance was noisy and
without caution, for their one thought was to find Patricia as
quickly as possible; and when they were suddenly met by a band of
plumed warriors, they were taken wholly by surprise. With savage
war cries, the Mayans charged, hurling stones from their
slings.</p>

<p>"Fire over their heads!" commanded the Colonel.</p>

<p>The terrifying noise momentarily stopped the Mayans, but when
Xatl Din realized that it was only noise and that it had not
injured any of his men, he ordered them to charge again; and once
more their hideous war cries sounded in the ears of the whites.</p>

<p>"Shoot to kill!" snapped the Colonel; "we've got to stop those
beggars before they reach us with their swords."</p>

<p>The rifles barked again, and four warriors fell. The others
wavered, but Xatl Din urged them on.</p>

<p>These things that killed with a loud noise at a distance
terrified the Mayans; and although some of them almost came to
grips with the whites, they finally turned and fled, taking their
wounded with them. Following their strategy, they scattered through
the jungle so as to leave no well-marked trail to their city; and
the whites, going in the wrong direction, became lost, for it is
difficult to orient one's self in a dense jungle; and when they
came to a steep declivity down a mountain side, they thought that
they had crossed the mountain and were descending the opposite
slope.</p>

<p>After stumbling about in dense shrubbery for an hour, they came
suddenly to the end of the jungle, only to stand looking at one
another in amazement, for before them lay the beach and their own
camp.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" ejaculated the Colonel.</p>

<p>As they approached the camp, Tibbett came to meet them, a
troubled look on his face.</p>

<p>"Something wrong, Tibbet?" demanded the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I'll say there's something wrong, sir. I just came back from
the Saigon with a load of planks to find that Schmidt and his
outfit have stolen all the firearms and ammunition that were left
in camp, as well as a considerable part of our stores."</p>

<p>"The scoundrels!" ejaculated the Colonel.</p>

<p>"But that's not the worst of it," continued Tibbet; "they took
Miss Laon away with them."</p>

<p>De Groote went white. "Which way did they go, Tibbet?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Back up the beach," replied the second mate; "probably to their
old camp."</p>

<p>De Groote, heartbroken and furious, started away. "Wait," said
the Colonel; "where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going after them," he said.</p>

<p>"They are all heavily armed," said the Colonel; "you couldn't do
anything alone, and we can't spare men to go with you
now&mdash;that is, we couldn't all go and leave Mrs. Leigh alone
here again, with the chance that those painted devils may attack
the camp at any time."</p>

<p>"I'm going anyway," said de Groote doggedly.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Tibbet, and then two of the sailors
from the Naiad also volunteered.</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," said the Colonel, "but for heaven's sake be
careful. You'd better sneak up on the camp from the jungle side and
snipe them from the concealment of the underbrush."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied de Groote, as he and the three who had
volunteered to accompany him started up the beach at a
dog-trot.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-22" id="S3-22">CHAPTER XXII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FROM a distance, Tarzan heard the firing during
the encounter between the whites and the Mayans, and immediately
turned and started back in the direction from which he thought the
sounds came; but because of the echoes and reverberations caused by
the mountains, he failed to locate it correctly, and went in the
wrong direction. Also, he was misled by his assumption that any
fighting there might be, would naturally be around Camp Saigon or
Schmidt's camp.</p>

<p>Knowing that he was nearer Schmidt's camp than Camp Saigon, he
decided to go there first and follow along the beach to Camp
Saigon, if the fight were not at the former place.</p>

<p>As he approached the end of the forest opposite Schmidt's camp,
he went more slowly and carefully, and it was well that he did for
as he came in view of the camp, he saw the men returning and that
the four whites were heavily armed. He saw Janette Laon being
dragged along by Krause, and the Lascars bearing loads. He knew
what had happened; but how it had happened, he could not guess. He
naturally assumed that the shooting he had heard had marked an
engagement between these men and those at Camp Saigon, and the
inference was that Schmidt's party had been victorious. Perhaps all
the other whites had been killed, but where was Patricia? Where was
little Itzl Cha? He was not concerned over the fate of Penelope
Leigh.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Colonel was on the horns of a dilemma. The camp could boast
of only four armed men now, scarcely enough to defend it; and he
couldn't go out to search for Patricia and leave Penelope
unguarded, nor could he divide his little force, for even four men
would scarcely be enough to repel another attack by Schmidt or by
the Mayans if they came in force, nor could four men hope
successfully to storm the city of Chichen Itza to which he was
convinced Patricia had been taken. And as the Colonel sought in
vain for a solution of his problem, Patricia Leigh-Burden was led
into the throne room of Cit Coh Xiu, King of Uxmal Island, and the
leader of her escort addressed the king.</p>

<p>"The noble Xatl Din ordered us to bring this prisoner to his
King and Master, as Xatl Din and his warriors continued on to
attack the camp of the strangers. There was a battle, for we heard
the strange noises with which these white men kill, but how the
battle went we do not know."</p>

<p>The king nodded. "Xatl Din has done well," he said.</p>

<p>"He has done excellently," said Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest;
"this woman will make a fitting offering to our gods."</p>

<p>Cit Coh Xiu's eyes appraised the white girl and found her
beautiful. She was the first white woman that he had ever seen, and
it suddenly occurred to him that it would be a shame to give her to
some god that might not want her. He didn't dare say so aloud, but
he thought that the girl was far too beautiful for any god; and, as
a matter of fact, by the standards of any race, Patricia
Leigh-Burden was beautiful.</p>

<p>"I think," said the king, "that I shall keep her as one of my
handmaidens for a while."</p>

<p>Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest, looked at the king in
well-simulated surprise. As a matter of fact, he was not surprised
at all, for he knew his king, who had already robbed the gods of
several pulchritudinous offerings. "If she is chosen for the gods,"
he said, "the gods will be angry with Cit Coh Xiu if he keeps her
for himself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be well," said the king, "if you were to see
that she is not chosen&mdash;at least immediately. I don't think
the gods want her anyway," he added.</p>

<p>Patricia, listening intently, had been able to understand at
least the gist of this conversation. "A god has already chosen me,"
she said, "and he will be angry if you harm me."</p>

<p>Cit Coh Xiu looked at her in surprise. "She speaks the language
of the Maya," he said to the high priest.</p>

<p>"But not very well," commented Chal Yip Xiu.</p>

<p>"The gods speak their own language," said Patricia; "they have
little use for the language of mortals."</p>

<p>"Can it be that she is a goddess?" demanded the king.</p>

<p>"I am the mate of Che, Lord Forest," said Patricia. "He is
already very angry with you for the way you treated him when he
came to Chichen Itza. If you are wise, you will send me back to
him. If you don't, he will certainly destroy you."</p>

<p>The king scratched his head and looked at his high priest
questioningly. "Well," he said, "you should know all about gods,
Chal Yip Xiu; was it indeed Che, Lord Forest, who came to Chichen
Itza? Was it a god that you put in a wooden cage? Was it a god who
stole the offering from the sacrificial altar?"</p>

<p>"It was not," snapped the high priest; "he was only a
mortal."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we must not act hastily," said the king. "You may
keep the girl temporarily; have her taken to the Temple of the
Virgins, and see that she is well treated." So Chal Yip Xiu
summoned two lesser priests and told them to conduct the prisoner
to The Temple of the Virgins.</p>

<p>Patricia felt that while she had not made much of an impression
on the high priest, she had upon the king, and that at least she
had won a reprieve which might give Tarzan and the others time in
which to rescue her; and as she was led from the Palace, her mind
was sufficiently at ease to permit her to note the wonders of
Chichen Itza.</p>

<p>Before her loomed a mighty pyramid of lava blocks, and up the
steep stairs on one side of this, she was led to an ornately carved
temple at the summit&mdash;The Temple of the Virgins. Here she was
turned over to the high priestess who was in charge of the temple,
in which were housed some fifty girls, mostly of noble families;
for it was considered an honor to volunteer for this service. They
kept the sacred fires alight and swept the temple floors. When they
wished to, they might resign and marry; and they were always sought
after by warriors and nobles.</p>

<p>Patricia stood in the temple colonnade and looked out over the
city of Chichen Itza. She could see its palaces and temples
clustered about the foot of the pyramid and the thatched huts of
the common people beyond the wall, and beyond these the fields
which extended to the edge of the jungle; and she fancied that she
had been carried back many centuries to ancient Yucatan.</p>

<hr>

<p>As Tarzan watched through the concealing verdure of the forest,
he realized the futility of attempting to come out in the open and
face four heavily armed men, while he was armed with only a bow.
But Tarzan had ways of his own, and he was quite secure in the
belief that he could take Janette away from these men without
unnecessarily risking his own life.</p>

<p>He waited until they had come closer and the Lascars had thrown
down their loads; then he fitted an arrow to his bow, and bending
the latter until the point of the arrow rested against his left
thumb, he took careful aim. The bow string twanged; and, an instant
later, Krause screamed and pitched forward upon his face, an arrow
through his heart.</p>

<p>The others looked about in consternation. "What happened?"
demanded Oubanovitch; "what's the matter with Krause?"</p>

<p>"He's dead!" said Schmidt. "Someone shot him with an arrow."</p>

<p>"The ape man," said Abdullah Abu Nejm; "who else could have done
it?"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Schmidt.</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Tarzan, "and I have plenty more arrows. Come
straight toward my voice, Janette, and into the forest; and if
anyone tries to stop you, he'll get what Krause got."</p>

<p>Janette walked quickly toward the forest, and no hand was raised
to detain her.</p>

<p>"That damn wildman!" ejaculated Schmidt, and then he broke into
a volley of lurid profanity. "I'll get him! I'll get him!" he
screamed, and, raising his rifle, fired into the forest in the
direction from which Tarzan's voice had come.</p>

<p>Again the bow-string twanged; and Schmidt, clutching at an arrow
in his chest, dropped to his knees and then rolled over on his
side, just as Janette entered the forest, and Tarzan dropped to the
ground beside her.</p>

<p>"What happened at the camp?" he asked, and she told him
briefly.</p>

<p>"So they let Schmidt and his gang come back," said Tarzan. "I am
surprised at the Colonel."</p>

<p>"It was mostly the fault of that horrid old woman," said
Janette.</p>

<p>"Come," said Tarzan, "we'll get back there as quickly as we
can," and swinging Janette to his shoulder, he took to the trees.
As he and Janette approached Camp Saigon, de Groote, Tibbet, and
the two sailors came into sight of Schmidt's camp.</p>

<p>A quick glance around the camp did not reveal Janette, but de
Groote saw two men lying on the ground, and the Lascars huddled to
one side, apparently terrified.</p>

<p>Abdullah was the first to see de Groote and his party, and
knowing that they had come for revenge and would show no quarter,
he swung his rifle to his shoulder and fired. He missed, and de
Groote and Tibbet ran forward, firing, the two sailors, armed only
with gaffs, at their heels.</p>

<p>Several shots were exchanged without any casualties, and then de
Groote dropped to one knee and took careful aim, and Tibbet
followed his example. "Take Oubanovitch," said de Groote; "I'll get
the Arab."</p>

<p>The two rifles spoke almost simultaneously, and Oubanovitch and
Abdullah Abu Nejm dropped in their tracks.</p>

<p>De Groote and Tibbet ran forward, followed by the sailors, ready
to finish off any of the men who still showed fight; but the
Russian, the Arab, and Krause were dead, and Schmidt was writhing
and screaming in agony, helpless to harm them.</p>

<p>De Groote bent over him. "Where is Miss Laon?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Screaming and cursing, his words almost unintelligible, Schmidt
mumbled, "The wildman, damn him, he took her," and then he
died.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" ejaculated de Groote; "she's safe now."</p>

<p>The four took the arms and ammunition from the bodies of the
dead men, and with the authority which they gave them, forced the
Lascars to pick up their packs and start back toward Camp
Saigon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="S3-23" id="S3-23">CHAPTER XXIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan and Janette stepped from the jungle and
approached the camp, they were greeted by a disheartened and
hopeless company, only one of whom found anything to be thankful
for. It was Penelope Leigh. When she saw them, she said to Algy,
"At least Patricia was not with that creature."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Aunt Pen," said Algy impatiently; "I suppose you
will say now that Tarzan and Janette arranged all this so that they
could meet in the jungle."</p>

<p>"I should not have been at all surprised," replied Mrs. Leigh.
"A man who would carry on with an Indian girl might do
anything."</p>

<p>Tarzan was disgusted with all that had been happening during his
absence, largely because his orders had been disobeyed, but he only
said, "They should never have been permitted within pistol shot of
this camp."</p>

<p>"It was my fault," said Colonel Leigh; "I did it against my
better judgment, because it did seem inhuman to send them back
there unarmed, with a man-eater hanging around their camp."</p>

<p>"It was not the Colonel's fault," said Janette, furiously; "he
was nagged into it. That hateful old woman is most to blame. She
insisted; and now, because of her, Hans may be killed." Even as she
ceased speaking, they heard the distant reports of firearms, coming
faintly from the direction of Schmidt's camp. "There!" cried
Janette; then she turned on Mrs. Leigh: "If anything happens to
Hans, his blood is on your head!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What has been done has been done," said Tarzan; "the important
thing now, is to find Patricia. Are you positive that she was
captured by the Maya?"</p>

<p>"We heard two shots," explained the Colonel, "and when we went
to investigate, we were met by fully a hundred Maya warriors. We
dispersed them, but were unable to follow their trail; and although
we saw nothing of Patricia, it seems most probable that she had
been captured by them before we met them."</p>

<p>"And now, William, I hope you are satisfied," said Mrs. Leigh;
"it is all your fault, for coming on that silly expedition in the
first place."</p>

<p>"Yes, Penelope," said the Colonel resignedly, "I suppose that it
is all my fault, but telling me that over and over again doesn't
help matters any."</p>

<p>Tarzan took Itzl Cha aside to talk to her away from the
interruptions of the others. "Tell me, Itzl Cha," he said, "what
your people would probably do with Patricia."</p>

<p>"Nothing, two, three days, maybe month," replied the girl; "then
they offer her to a god."</p>

<p>"Look at that creature now," said Penelope Leigh, "taking that
little Indian girl off and whispering to her. I can well imagine
what he is saying."</p>

<p>"Would they put Patricia in the cage where they had me?" Tarzan
asked.</p>

<p>"I think in The Temple of the Virgins at the top of the sacred
pyramid; Temple of the Virgins very sacred place and well
guarded."</p>

<p>"I can reach it," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You are not going there?" demanded Itzl Cha.</p>

<p>"Tonight," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>The girl threw her arms about him. "Please don't go," she
begged; "you cannot save her, and they will kill you."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Penelope Leigh; "of all the brazen things I've
ever seen in my life! William, you must put a stop to it. I cannot
stand it; I have never before had to associate with loose people,"
and she cast a venomous glance at Janette.</p>

<p>Tarzan disengaged the girl's arms. "Come, come, Itzl Cha," he
said; "I shall not be killed."</p>

<p>"Don't go," she pleaded. "Oh, Che, Lord Forest, I love you. Take
me away into the forest with you. I do not like these people."</p>

<p>"They have been very kind to you," Tarzan reminded her.</p>

<p>"I know," said Itzl Cha sullenly, "but I do not want their
kindness; I want only you, and you must not go to Chichen Itza
tonight nor ever."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled and patted her shoulder. "I go tonight," he
said.</p>

<p>"You love her," cried Itzl Cha; "that is the reason you are
going. You are leaving me for her."</p>

<p>"That will be all," said Tarzan firmly; "say no more." Then he
left her and joined the others, and Cha, furious with jealousy,
went into her hut and threw herself upon the ground, kicking it
with her sandaled feet and beating it with her little fists.
Presently she arose and looked out through the doorway, just in
time to see de Groote and his party returning, and while the
attention of all the others was centered upon them, little Itzl Cha
crept from her hut and ran into the jungle.</p>

<p>Janette ran forward and threw her arms about de Groote, tears of
joy running down her cheeks. "I thought that you had been killed,
Hans," she sobbed; "I thought that you had been killed."</p>

<p>"I am very much alive," he said, "and you have nothing more to
fear from Schmidt and his gang; they are all dead."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Tarzan; "they were bad men."</p>

<p>Little Itzl Cha ran through the jungle. She was terrified, for
it was growing dark, and there are demons and the spirits of the
dead in the forest at night; but she ran on, spurred by jealousy
and hate and desire for revenge.</p>

<p>She reached Chichen Itza after dark, and the guard at the gate
was not going to admit her until she told him who she was, and that
she had important word for Chal Yip Xiu, the high priest. She was
taken to him then, and she fell on her knees before him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded, and then he recognized her. "So you
have come back," he said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you that the man who stole me from the
sacrificial altar is coming tonight to take the white girl from the
temple."</p>

<p>"For this you deserve much from the gods," said Chal Yip Xiu,
"and again you shall be honored by being offered to them," and
little Itzl Cha was placed in a wooden cage to await sacrifice.</p>

<p>Tarzan came slowly through the forest on his way to Chichen
Itza. He did not wish to arrive before midnight, when he thought
that the city would have quieted down and most of its inmates would
be asleep. A gentle wind was blowing in his face, and it brought to
his nostrils a familiar scent spoor&mdash;Tantor, the elephant, was
abroad. He had found an easier trail to the plateau than the
shorter one which Tarzan used, and he had also found on the plateau
a plenteous supply of the tender shoots he loved best.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not call him until he had come quite close, and then
he spoke in a low voice; and Tantor, recognizing his voice, came
and verified his judgment by passing his trunk over the ape man's
body.</p>

<p>At a word of command, he lifted Tarzan to his withers, and the
Lord of the Jungle rode to the edge of the forest just outside of
the city of Chichen Itza.</p>

<p>Slipping from Tantor's head, Tarzan crossed the fields to the
city wall. Before he reached it, he broke into a run, and when it
loomed before him, he scaled it much as a cat would have done. The
city was quiet and the streets were deserted; so that Tarzan
reached the foot of the pyramid without encountering anyone.</p>

<p>Just inside the entrance to The Temple of the Virgins, a dozen
warriors hid in the shadows as Tarzan climbed the steps to the
summit. Outside the temple he stopped and listened; then he walked
around to the lee side, so that the breeze that was blowing would
carry to his sensitive nostrils the information that he wished.</p>

<p>He stood there for a moment; and then, satisfied, he crept
stealthily around to the entrance. At the threshold he stopped
again and listened; then he stepped inside, and as he did so a net
was thrown over him and drawn tight, and a dozen warriors fell upon
him and so entangled him in the meshes that he was helpless.</p>

<p>A priest stepped from the temple and, raising a trumpet to his
lips, blew three long blasts. As if by magic, the city awoke,
lights appeared, and people came streaming towards the temple
pyramid.</p>

<p>Tarzan was carried down the long flight of steps, and at the
bottom, he was surrounded by priests in long embroidered cloaks and
gorgeous headdresses. Then they brought Patricia. With trumpets and
drums preceding them, Cit Coh Xiu, the king, and Chat Yip Xiu, the
high priest, headed a procession that wound through the city and
out of the east gate.</p>

<p>Tarzan had been placed on a litter that was carried by four
priests; behind him walked Patricia, under guard; and behind her
little Itzl Cha was carried in her wooden cage. A full moon cast
its soft light on the barbaric procession, which was further
illuminated by hundreds of torches carried by the marchers.</p>

<p>The procession wound through the forest to the foot of a
mountain, up which it zig-zagged back and forth until it reached
the rim of the crater of an extinct volcano at the summit. It was
almost dawn as the procession made its way down a narrow trail to
the bottom of the crater and stopped there at the edge of a yawning
hole. Priests intoned a chant to the accompaniment of flutes,
drums, and trumpets; and, just at dawn, the bag was cut away from
Tarzan and he was hurled into the chasm, notwithstanding the pleas
of Itzl Cha, who had repented and warned the priests that the man
was really Che, Lord Forest. She had begged them not to kill him,
but Chat Yip Xiu had silenced her and spoken the word that sent
Tarzan to his doom.</p>

<h2><a name="S3-24" id="S3-24">CHAPTER XXIV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">PATRICIA LEIGH-BURDEN was not the type of girl
easily moved to tears, but she stood now on the brink of that
terrible abyss, her body racked by sobs; and then as the sun topped
the rim and shed its light down into the crater, she saw Tarzan
swimming slowly about in a pond some seventy feet below her.
Instantly her mind leaped to the stories she had read of the sacred
dzonot of ancient Chichen Itza in Yucatan, and hope burned again in
her breast.</p>

<p>"Tarzan," she called, and the man turned over on his back and
looked up at her. "Listen," she continued. "I know this form of
sacrifice well; it was practiced by the Maya in Central America
hundreds and hundreds of years ago. The victim was thrown into the
sacred well at Chichen Itza at dawn, and if he still lived at noon,
he was taken out and raised to highest rank; he became practically
a living god on earth. You must keep afloat until noon, Tarzan; you
must! you must!"</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled up at her and waved. The priests eyed her
suspiciously, though they had no idea what she had said to their
victim.</p>

<p>"Do you think that you can, Tarzan?" she said. "You must,
because I love you."</p>

<p>Tarzan did not reply, as he turned over and commenced to swim
slowly around the pool, which was about a hundred feet in diameter
with perpendicular sides of smooth volcanic glass.</p>

<p>The water was chilly but not cold, and Tarzan swam just strongly
enough to keep from becoming chilled.</p>

<p>The people had brought food and drink; and as they watched
through the long dragging hours, they made a fiesta of the
occasion.</p>

<p>As the sun climbed toward zenith, Chal Yip Xiu commenced to show
signs of strain and nervousness, for if the victim lived until
noon, he might prove indeed to be Che, Lord Forest, which would be
most embarrassing for the Ah Kin Mai. Every eye that could see it
was upon a crude sundial that stood beside the rim of the dzonot;
and when it marked noon, a great shout arose, for the victim was
still alive.</p>

<p>The high priest was furious as the people acclaimed Tarzan as
Che, Lord Forest, and demanded that he be taken from the water. A
long rope was thrown down to him, with a noose in the end of it by
means of which he could be drawn out of the dzonot; but Tarzan
ignored the noose and clambered up the rope, hand over hand. When
he stepped out upon the rim, the people fell to their knees before
him and supplicated him for forgiveness and for favors.</p>

<p>The king and the high priest looked most uncomfortable as Tarzan
faced them. "I came to earth in the form of a mortal," he said, "to
see how you ruled my people of Chichen Itza. I am not pleased. I
shall come again some day to see if you have improved. Now I go,
and I take this woman with me," and he placed a hand upon
Patricia's arm. "I command you to release Itzl Cha, and to see that
neither she nor any others are sacrificed before I return."</p>

<p>He took Patricia by the hand, and together they climbed the
steep trail to the rim of the crater and then down the side of the
volcano, the people following them, in a long procession, singing
as they marched. As they reached the city, Tarzan turned and held
up a hand. "Come no farther," he said to the people, and then to
Patricia, "Now I'll give them something to tell their grandchildren
about."</p>

<p>She looked up at him questioningly and smiled. "What are you
going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>For answer, he voiced a long weird cry, and then, in the
language of the great apes, shouted, "Come, Tantor, come!" and as
he and Patricia crossed the field and approached the forest, a
great bull elephant came out of it to meet them, and a cry of
astonishment and fear rose from the people behind them.</p>

<p>"Won't he gore us or something?" asked Patricia, as they
approached the bull.</p>

<p>"He is my friend," said Tarzan, laying his hand upon the trunk
of the great beast. "Don't be frightened," he said to Patricia; "he
is going to lift you to his withers," and at a word of command,
Tantor swung the girl up and then lifted Tarzan.</p>

<p>As he wheeled to go into the forest, Tarzan and Patricia looked
back to see the people of Chichen Itza all kneeling, their faces
pressed against the ground.</p>

<p>"Their great-great-grandchildren will hear of this," said
Patricia.</p>

<hr>

<p>In Camp Saigon, the discouraged company waited hopelessly for
Tarzan's return. There had been little sleep the previous night for
many of them, and the long hours of the morning had dragged
heavily. Tea time came and Tarzan had not returned; but, as a
matter of habit, they had tea served; and as they sat around the
table, sipping it listlessly, the same thought must have been in
the minds of all; they would never see Patricia or Tarzan
again.</p>

<p>"You should never have let that creature go out after Patricia
alone," said Mrs. Leigh; "he probably found her all right, and
there is no telling what has happened to her by this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, Penelope!" cried the Colonel hopelessly. "Why are you so
bitter against that man? He has done nothing but befriend us."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" exclaimed Penelope, "You are very dense, William; I
could see through him from the first&mdash;he is a climber; he
wants to get into our good graces and then he will probably try to
marry Patricia for the money she will inherit."</p>

<p>"Madam," said de Groote very icily, "'that creature,' as you
call him, is John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, an English
viscount."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed Mrs. Leigh.</p>

<p>"It is not bosh," said de Groote; "Krause told me who he was
while we were locked up together in that cage. He got it from the
Arab, who has known the man for years."</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh's chin dropped, and she seemed to suddenly deflate,
but she rallied quickly. "I rather expected it," she said after a
moment. "All that I ever criticized in him was his predilection for
nudity. Why didn't you ever tell us this before, young man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why I told you now," replied de Groote; "it is
none of my business; if he had wanted us to know, he would have
told us."</p>

<p>"Here he comes now!" exclaimed Janette, "and Patricia is with
him!"</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" exclaimed Penelope. "What a fine looking couple
my niece and Lord Greystoke make."</p>

<p>From the withers of the elephant, Patricia could see far out
beyond the reef; and when she and Tarzan slipped to the ground, she
ran toward the group awaiting them, pointing and crying, "Look! A
ship! A ship!"</p>

<p>It was a ship far out; and the men hastened to build a fire on
the beach, and when it was burning, to throw on green leaves and
kerosene until a great black smoke rose high into the sky.</p>

<p>De Groote and some of the sailors put out in one of the boats in
a frantic, if potentially futile, effort to further attract the
ship's attention.</p>

<p>"They don't see us," said Janette.</p>

<p>"And there may not be another ship in a hundred years," remarked
Dr. Crouch.</p>

<p>"Jolly long time to wait for anything, what?" said Algy.</p>

<p>"They've changed their course," said Bolton; "they're heading
in."</p>

<p>The Colonel had gone to his hut and now he came out with
binoculars in his hand. He took a long look through them; and when
he took the glasses down, there were tears in his eyes; and it was
a moment before he could speak.</p>

<p>"It's the Naiad," he said, "and she is heading inshore."</p>

<hr>

<p>That night, under a full tropic moon, two couples lounged in
comfortable chairs on the deck of the Naiad. Tarzan laid a hand on
one of Patricia's. "In your nervous excitement today at the Dzonot,
you said something, Patricia, that we must both forget."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," she replied. "You see, I didn't know
then that it was impossible&mdash;but I meant it then, and I shall
always mean it."</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" called de Groote from the other side of the yacht.
"Janette is trying to convince me that the Captain can't marry us.
She's wrong, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that she is wrong," replied the ape man.</p>
