BY THAT GENTLEMAN UPON WHAT HAS BEEN,<br>
DURING ALL KNOWN AGE,<br>
THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO HUMAN ADVANCEMENT;<br>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Reader,</p>

<p>If you are under eighteen years old, close this book. It would
not interest you.</p>

<p>To those past that age I say: Whatever are your opinions, read
it through without shock or start. Then judge calmly and
conscientiously my comments on the truths so mysteriously taught
me. You will see&mdash;provided you have a grain of common
sense&mdash;that I attack <i>principles</i>, not individuals. I
have no desire to hurt quadruped or biped; not even those who have
injured me past world-healing.</p>

<p>If you possess any&mdash;the smallest amount&mdash;of
<i>real</i> reverence, you will understand the deeply reverent
feeling with which all herein is written.</p>

<p>H. A. DUGDALE.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>

<p class="footnote">"The new claim of woman to a political status is itself an
honourable testimony to the civilization which has given her a
civil status new in history. Now that by the increased humanity of
law she controls her property, she inevitably takes the next step
to her share in power."<br>
<br>
&mdash;<i>Progress of Culture</i>, RALPH WALDO EMERSON.</p>

<p class="footnote">"The truth is in the air, and the most impressionable brain will
announce it first, but all will announce it a few minutes later. So
woman, as most impressionable is the best index of the coming
hour."<br>
<br>
&mdash;<i>Conduct of Life</i>, RALPH WALDO EMERSON.</p>

<p>I stand in the doorway of an immense building, which appears to
be devoted to the display of antiquities. Many people are entering,
although the morning is young. A magnificent scene is before
me.</p>

<p>At last I see a city in which are combined grandeur,
cleanliness, order and picturesque loveliness. Between this one and
those of the nineteenth century exists a difference as great, if
not greater, than between the latter and the loathsome lairs of our
cannibal progenitors reeking with refuse of human remains. My mind
power has so widened that I know more than can be here told.</p>

<p>The buildings are truly grand works of art. All stand on noble
columns of great size and strength. I cannot recognize what we call
"streets." All structures are in clusters, though each house is
separate. Very few prominent angles, only sufficient to make the
curves more beautiful. Between the clusters are large distances,
occupied in their centres by statuary, trees and scented shrubs.
Many prettily-designed fountains are throwing their precious jewels
into the rays a glorious morning sun. No smoke-disfigured
architecture. No stream of poisonous filth, running with ferocious
delight on its deathly errand. No besotted-looking creatures
offending passers-by with debasing language. No jails. No knots of
babbling men standing around entrances to publichouses, vieing with
each other for destruction of intelligence. Indeed, such things so
pitiable could not be for here are no such houses. No ill-fed,
barefooted, unclean children, learning the probationary steps to
scoundrelism. No suffering animals, urged by cruelty to overtax
their strength. No decrepitude in age. No careworn faces. All are
lovely with the light of knowledge&mdash;knowledge not in the
capabilities of our lower natures, but towards which we are surely
tending.</p>

<p>I know these graceful beings are humans&mdash;yet how they
differ from my own poor self, and all others of our era.</p>

<p>They appear <i>luminous</i> with integrity and benevolence. Both
sexes are bewitchingly graceful. Women are rather taller than the
generality of the present generation, but the men are not such fine
animals as those of my century, though far nobler looking.</p>

<p>Their ambition has evidently been to attain efficiency in
intellect and benignity in preference to the retention of tiger
muscle. Another link to the brute fast disappearing.</p>

<p>My increased comprehension tells me the inner life of these
persons is as noble as the expression of their countenances. But
this is very many thousands of years hence, as I now plainly
perceive by the model of a racehorse placed amongst other models of
extinct mammals in the spacious court-yard below where I stand.</p>

<p>Vehicles of different sizes are passing swiftly on the ground
and in the air. Some disappear through large openings in upper
stories of enormous buildings.</p>

<p>I hear the cheerful hum of busy life, but it seems too minute a
sound compared with all that movement. Ah, our vanity in the
present renders it extremely difficult to hear the sounds from
future ages, or see what is there passing without deeming it
illusion. Yet I distinctly feel some of these beings touch my hand
and nerve me as they pass into the great hall.</p>

<p>Here are three mounting the stairs. A lady about fifty years of
age with her only children&mdash;a daughter between eighteen and
nineteen, and son perhaps two years younger. It is very fortunate
they are unable to see the staring habits of our century, for they
are all so beautiful in form and mind I cannot remove my eyes from
them. Every trace of wildbeast treachery and cruelty obliterated.
Grand creatures are these! Benevolent, courageous and intelligent
as only very numerous generations of truth loving ancestors could
make them.</p>

<p>No, sceptics, "distance" has not "lent" this
enchantment&mdash;that is, in the sense you imply&mdash;for I am
near enough to hear the elder lady say:</p>

<p>"My darlings, this morning we will glance at some of the relics
of what was once called the 'Christian Era,' subsequently
designated by historians as 'The Age of Blood and Malevolence,' but
which is, nevertheless, always of importance in the world's library
from its having been the first link in the long unbroken chain of
eras of civilization. If time will permit we will take from the
twenty-first century to the fifteenth."</p>

<p>Only six centuries in one whole morning! That seems slow work.
<i>We</i> go through the relics of <i>ages</i> in an hour or so,
and then think ourselves sufficiently informed in their wonderful
lessons for the rest of our lives. I cannot help feeling a proud
delight that these lovable persons are going to include the present
time in their examinations, and shall remain by them to hear their
gratifying expressions of astonishment at our remarkable
progress.</p>

<p>They have turned into a very long gallery, over the entrance to
which is written:</p>

<p>"CHRISTIAN ERA, OR AGE OF BLOOD TO THE TWENTY-FIRST
CENTURY."</p>

<p>They enter an alcove containing four or five seats and
desks&mdash;easily lowered or raised&mdash;writing necessaries and
book of reference, concerning only those objects of interest which
are placed in front. As far as I can see down the centre of this
gallery are similar alcoves ranged back to back. All appear to be
occupied by families somewhat resembling the one I have chosen to
remain with, and that there is now no vacant room must be notified
to new comers by some known signal, for I observe them look at one
of the pillars supporting the roof and pass without entering. So
there is no more movement to distract the students than is
requisite for exchange of alcoves, which is managed with such
courtesy and considerative quiet that it causes no interruption. No
one speaks more loudly than is necessary for the distance in
occupation by her or his party; and us all have musical voices, the
combination of these soft, sweet sounds comes to my ears as a new
entrancing harmony. Involuntarily my memory recalls the
wild-beastly roar of footballers one afternoon when I was
unfortunately compelled to walk about half a mile from where they
were going through their brutal pastime.</p>

<p>"Though," continues this lady, "you must naturally expect to
find the brute still more unpleasantly prominent than you have yet
seen."</p>

<p>"<i>More</i> prominent!" echoes the boy. "Then, mother, I think
evolution most degrading if it proves that we came from beings
lower than those we examined last Sunday and Monday."</p>

<p>"My Frederick, I am not at all surprised at your opinion. Youth
in the individual, as youth in a world, cannot judge accurately on
subjects where accuracy is all-important. When the world was much
younger, and the vanity of unthinking beings was, of course, very
strong, most men thought as you do. When you are older you will not
give so positive an opinion on any subject without reflection, or
judge by the <i>portion</i> only of an argument. You will, more
wisely, await the whole."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear and generous-minded mother, you are right, as you
always are. I ought not to have spoken so hastily, but I was
thinking of that twenty-first century's mode of insulting woman by
placing women members of the Senate in a third chamber to debate by
themselves."</p>

<p>Smiling, the lady replies: "Oh! my true-hearted
<i>ch</i><i>evalier des dames</i>, it is not known whether that
arrangement originated in men's comical vanity, or from a wish by
the women to secure quiet in their debates, the men being notorious
in those days for their silly quarrels and irrelevant chatter. You
must endeavour to restrain all impatience, for I have that to tell
you concerning your progenitors which to your brave mind will
appear cowardly and debasing; but when you shall have learned to
dissect these truths with the calm judgment arising from more
philosophical thought, you will perceive that all that primitive
wrong-doing was entirely from the vanity and prejudice born of
ignorance. It would be unjust and unreasonable were I to feel anger
or contempt for my loved son because his thought is immature. So
with those other children&mdash;those still more imperfect beings
of a younger world&mdash;living under the allpowerful, though by
them unseen, law of evolution. Ought we to be indignant with them
because they had not the great benevolence which springs only from
the knowledge of numerous ages? and because, being nearer the
brute, they naturally showed more traces of their origin? Grasp
that, and you will not be surprised to learn that the males of
these primitive people held their own sex in such veneration that
quite young ones&mdash;puny in intellect, and without
education&mdash;were, by act of senate, qualified to elect
senators, enter upon the government of the world, and occupy the
highest offices to the exclusion of the Infinite Intelligence,
where possessed by women. So those poor vain creatures, with much
assumption of wisdom, though still very apelike in various ways,
made laws affecting woman's liberty, property, and even her
children, without consulting her, her happiness, or any higher
feeling than their own self-love, comfort and aboriginal greed. In
short, the women up to past the nineteenth century were really
slaves in all but the name. It is known that men long retained much
of brute strength, gained in the still earlier ages by fierce
combats for possession of women to toil for them; and they
sedulously preserved all they could of that great muscular power,
because they imagined it to be a proof of superiority. By use of it
they were enabled, during all the low ages, to keep women in a very
subjective state, which you will find the more degrading the nearer
we descend to the brute period. Little wonder then should we feel
that when men commenced forms of religion they framed them with
doctrines for continuing the humiliation of women. In all their
so-called religious exercises they dinned in her ears old men's
tales of how she had been the primary cause of every wrong-doing,
for which she had been doomed to suffer cruel punishment, and be
subservient to man through all earthly life. Some even went so far
in their selfexaltation as to rear woman in the belief that she had
no soul&mdash;no existence beyond the debasing one allotted to her
by those near cousins of apes and tigers. The 'religious' ceremony
of marriage in use by the ancestors of our own race was
characteristic of the very small place conscientiousness then held
in the world's mind. Men trained to the profession of
goodness&mdash;called 'clergymen' or 'ministers of
God'&mdash;administered the sacred oaths, knowing they thereby
assisted in the perpetration of a crime; for the husband&mdash;so
the man was named, and meant master&mdash;vowed to the Infinite
that he would endow his wife&mdash;old name for slave&mdash;with
all his 'worldly goods,' and that he would 'cherish' and 'love'
her. Except in very rare cases, the endowment not only ended in
nothing, but he annexed everything valuable that belonged to her,
under the miserable pretext similar to others they used in all
their acts of unjust dealing with women&mdash;that woman's brain
was inadequate to the care of her own property; and, with the same
ape logic they asserted that her strength was insufficient for the
various light situations monopolized by man. So she generally
performed the menial work, which was very severe in those days of
crude appliances and badly constructed dwellings&mdash;so severe
that she frequently died from the effects&mdash;lamed, and hands
distorted in her heroic efforts to fulfil duties imposed upon her
by the apish cunning of the males. The husband frequently proved
his superior intellect by the rapidity with which he squandered his
wife's property, and reduced her to hardships she never would have
known had his sense or conscientiousness equalled hers. As to the
loving and cherishing&mdash;alas!"</p>

<p>She is silent. Her kind eyes appear to be looking sadly and
compassionately through the mighty past into the aching hearts of
my century.</p>

<p>Though anxious to hear more, the young people respect her
silence. Now her daughter, who had hitherto been taking notes,
looks up. What a countenance! No mirror&mdash;whether of
quicksilver, canvass or marble&mdash;ever in the world's 'early
eras'&mdash;as they call our time&mdash;reflected so real a beauty.
Added to the grand look of integrity all faces here possess, hers
shows deeper thought than has yet come to her brother; and the
expression of loving reverence for that dear mother! Was there ever
aught so charming in a daughter?</p>

<p>My readers' share in this pleasure will be small, for I have not
power to depict all I see.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' reflection, the mother resumes:</p>

<p>"My delight has been to master, as far as is known, all details
concerning the development of our species, and our own race
especially, from earliest records. For many years it occupied the
whole of my study hours; but, even did our time permit, I would not
impart the worst that those researches taught me."</p>

<p>"I hope," interrupted Frederick, with tones of increasing
interest, "you will tell us more of those brave women and wicked
men."</p>

<p>To which she answers, with great nobility of expression in both
face and voice:</p>

<p>"You must learn to think of those vain creatures as not
wicked."</p>

<p>With a roguish smile, he replies:</p>

<p>"Well then, <i>stupid</i> men! Do let me call them something
they merit for their ill-treatment of women."</p>

<p>"Nay, my son, not even stupid, except by unfair comparison with
the more evolved minds of our age; many were highly
intellectual."</p>

<p>"But," says he, with the air of gaining victory, "they evinced
no logic, either in ethics or in natural philosophy&mdash;that is,
judged by what I have learnt as yet. Ethics, indeed! why our Leoni
shows more logic in his ethics! and he would neither crush nor maim
us, although he has such great muscular power."</p>

<p>"Bravely argued, dear! But, like most young reasoners, more from
sympathy than reason. In the first place, tigers are now more
gentle than were men in the age under notice. Our pet would crush
no persons, whether he loved them or not. In this he but acts
according to his extent of benevolence, as did those apparently
cruel men, who were only commencing to emerge from the anti-lucan
age. Though intellect was coming to most of them, they were very
deficient in the higher qualities of benevolence and
conscientiousness. Thus they were neither <i>wicked</i> nor
<i>stupid</i>, simply and sadly for all under their rule, very very
ignorant&mdash;so ignorant that they knew not the wrong they were
committing&mdash;consequently great truths were obscured from their
understanding by their vanity. In ethics they acted as far as their
semi-barbarous nature made clear to them. Morality had then a
different signification; their conception of it was far from
resembling the high feeling it is with us. We must think of those
poor creatures as they were constituted&mdash;not judge them by our
advanced natures. To do so is as illogical as if you were to
upbraid kind Leo with stupidity, because he could not solve one of
your mathematical problems."</p>

<p>Kissing his mother's hand he acknowledges, in reverential words,
her maturer reflections. Receiving his contrition with her
habitual, lovable manner, she continues: "However, woman's position
greatly changed in the twentieth century. The example was given in
a grand part of the world called, America, where first appeared
advanced intellect which guided human kind to nobler work than had
before been thought of."</p>

<p>Then, turning to her daughter: "My Veritée, you who were so
ready with your opinions two years ago have you none now to
offer?"</p>

<p>"My silence is not from lessened interest, dear mother. On the
contrary, I have been too occupied for speech in studying the
reflex of my younger thoughts in those now expressed by Frederick.
When you commenced your instruction of myself in evolution, I felt
exactly as he feels. That such beings should have been our
progenitors was an indignation that lasted long. I used to
fervently hope some talented naturalist would discover it had been
all a mistake&mdash;a futile and unreasonable hope, for at the same
time I saw how indisputably real it had been proved to be. So
beautifully has the growing intelligence of ages preserved through
all the earth's changes traces of our slow but certain development,
the gradual alteration in bodily structure and correlativety, that
of all appertaining to mind. But it is no longer a disquietude all
lesser feelings have resolved into an absorbing wonder&mdash;more
absorbing still when I miss the intervening time, and compare the
low beings, whose ethics and world-government we are now reviewing,
with my noble father."</p>

<p>"Modestly-spoken conscientious thoughts! A result I expected
when I forebore to press your young judgment at that time on
matters so important. Given facts, and honest thought and great
truths <i>never</i> fail to reveal themselves before the reflection
of an <i>earnest</i> mind. You are right, dear, in calling your
loved father noble, for so he is in every thought and act, and
likewise all humans of our age, compared with the half savages
whose habits and natures we are examining. Understand I say
<i>compared</i>, because humankind is still progressing. We must
endeavour not to give the future cause to stamp us with conceit, as
well as lesser knowledge than it will possess. This was one of the
great errors of our ancestors. The bulk of the ancient Australians,
for whom we feel such pity, imagined there remained little else to
learn. A fallacious idea, which operated powerfully in delaying
progress&mdash;and that brings me back to the point where your
brother interrupted. Of course the laws made by such men as I have
endeavoured to describe, not only fully protected themselves, but
sanctioned their perjury and wife-plundering! and&mdash;this I tell
you to caution you against self-laudation&mdash;these same men
boasted of their religious sentiments and great height in ethics,
yet they broke the vows made at their altars with absolute
impunity! and such conduct brought to them no loss or disgrace, no
lowered status in anything. They boasted, too, of their fine sense
of justice as compared with woman's, yet when a wife discovered her
husband to be utterly unworthy of her, and left him because she
could not live a life of foul hypocrisy, they put her to death at
once. As civilization advanced, such a woman was killed more
slowly. The husband was permitted to keep her children for any
degraded life he chose. He spread evil untruths against her. The
husband having thus given permission everyone was at liberty to
follow his example, which all cruel persons availed themselves
of&mdash;knowing they could indulge their disposition to injure
without any fear of punishment or without being expected to feel
mercy for the poor suffering heart&mdash;wearing life away in the
pain of sorrow while the husband proudly proclaimed that he was
made in the image of his god."</p>

<p>"Oh, the irreverent coward!" exclaims Frederick.</p>

<p>His mother continues in graver tones, yet so thrillingly tender,
for she knows well that dear son's heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was said of him by some in those very times&mdash;but
civilization was then only in its infancy. You forget, through your
impetuosity, one of the objects of your present study;&mdash;how
much that to the unthinking wears the appearance of 'irreverence'
or other wickedness has proceeded solely from the arrogance of
ignorance." Looking very earnestly at him, she adds: "When a
danger&mdash;and thoughtlessness is a great danger&mdash;has been
pointed out for our avoidance, they are unwise who heed not the
friendly warning."</p>

<p>The boy raises his truthful eyes to his mother's with an
admiring glance which acknowledges very winningly the justice of
her reproof&mdash;yet will not trust himself to speak; his
high-minded nature is too deeply wounded at learning his
relationship to so low a form of life.</p>

<p>The thoughtful, beautiful eyes of his mother have again their
abstracted expression as of examining into that far-off past of
which she discourses.</p>

<p>"Those primitive men had numerous peculiar forms of belief. A
little reflection would show you that acting in accordance with
them could not be called 'irreverence.' They worshipped the
Infinite as an avenging deity of an exceedingly vain and cruel
nature, and, by a strange complexity in metaphysics, boastfully
claimed a likeness to that deity; but it was no more irreverence in
them than was the belief of their ancestors in still more
primordial creeds&mdash;namely, that the earth was flat, a place
below named 'hell,' and one above named 'heaven,' both of which
places were inhabited by many gods&mdash;some of whom, indeed the
most of them, judged by the growing light of succeeding ages, were
remarkably immoral. When they reduced their deities to <i>one</i>
they made that one a male, and with their usual deficiency in
reason said his <i>sons</i> came down to earth 'to the daughters of
men;' and that their progeny became 'men of renown.' Such a belief
formed part of the creed of the more civilized time which we are
reviewing. It was printed by those peculiar people in some curious
books called Bible, Koran, &amp;c., the contents of which were
taught by their myth-men, or 'clergymen,' to have been the actual
words of their god. But all that will be fully explained in our
mornings for mythology. I only touch the subject to show you that
morality and religion are of close affinity. When we know the creed
of a nation we can judge correctly as to its ethics. If the creed
be of an impossible or debasing nature the ethics will be found to
correspond. We may deplore the ignorance which caused so much
wrong-doing and suffering, but must not abase our own higher minds
by condemning those poor men because they had not the knowledge
that, except in extraordinary instances, can only be born of time
and experience&mdash;a knowledge that grew as slowly as their
change of bodily structure. As it grew, so they acquired increasing
power to control, and, as we have seen in higher ages, ultimately
extinguish all grosser traces of brute origin. If any blame
attaches to early civilization it is solely to such heads of
communities who, while possessing more than the ordinary
understanding and some scientific learning, continued the
promulgation of fallacies to the multitude, which they dared not
utter to the Infinite in their solitude, simply to retain worldly
position! Much honour is due to the integrity and courage of the
few who would not bow to untruth, who thus risked and often bore
with heroism the wrath of fanatics, whose vengeance was as great as
their minds were small."</p>

<p>In tones so musically compassionate&mdash;they thrill me while I
listen&mdash;she continues: "Yes, fierce and terrible to reflect
upon has been the domination of ignorance! The further we examine
into the evolution of our species, the more terrible will it show
itself to have been. The more fully will it prove beyond all other
proofs, our low origin. The lower we proceed in our researches
shall we find the suffering it caused of such magnitude and
hideousness that it cannot fail to create in our minds firm and
lasting resolves not to be drawn, though in never so little a
degree, within its deadening circle. Understand, my darlings, I
refer not to lack of rote learning alone&mdash;where that is the
sole knowledge, the possessor is often but a tiresome bookcase. To
the study of others' written ideas we should always add our own. We
must try more for the learning which honest thought
gives&mdash;thought, that wordless, powerful prayer to the Infinite
Mind, which is never without result. A person without daily habit
of thought is but a child in all high knowledge, while also losing
curb over what of brute may be in her or his nature. You reply,
perhaps, 'What shall I think?' Every subject appears so
impenetrable to your young comprehension. You resemble one
contemplating a thickly grown, dark looking forest, wishing to find
out something of its mystery; but it looks dangerous and impossible
to make way through the tangled growth. At last you resolve to
attempt entrance&mdash;Ha! Now, where is the difficulty? Only to
restrain your inclination, lest you venture too far at once. These
glades with their soft light, where is the darkness so feared?
There are revealed to you beauties and grandeurs you would never
have known by standing on the verge and only feebly wishing to dare
further. You, my Veritée, have already entered. The result has been
pleasantly shown during many of our morning studies."</p>

<p>Hearing these words, a blush of delight comes over the girl's
face as she answers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, mother dear it has proved to me many errors of my
judgment. One, especially, has been made even more apparent by some
of the details you have kindly drawn from your great memory to aid
us in understanding our development. I used to think the senate had
been needlessly cautious in having fixed thirty as the age for
entering into the government of the world. Now, I feel only content
in that it gives me ten years more for fitting myself to undertake
those important duties. I have resolved not to rely only on the
required standard, but to attain a much higher degree of knowledge,
that I may testify to all your patient instruction, and distinguish
our name, as you have done, by introduction of some measures the
benefit of which will extend to future ages. I cannot express the
pride it gave me to learn that the women legislators introduced
those worldreforming measures which raised the standard of learning
and increased the requisite age. Only within the past year did I
begin to understand how necessary it is that senators should
possess the knowledge of years, as well as that of books. Looking
back over that sad past, it is so easy to see that none of those
cruel wrongs would have taken place had law-making and
law-administering not been entrusted to such very young and
ignorant men, without aid from woman's mind, which appears to have
shown more real courage, more benevolence, and sounder idea of
justice than that of her male oppressors."</p>

<p>How I wish my readers could see the beautiful picture it has
been accorded me to examine!</p>

<p>This high-minded, glorious young couple, resplendent with
promise of future excellence, and the noble mother, her handsome
face expressing wisdom in every glance&mdash;at this moment
lustrous with admiring love as she reads her daughter's innermost
thoughts, its wonderful beauty unmarred by debasing cares, or cause
for sad memories. They must be of noble blood. What they say is so
exquisite tones and language too, I could not give an adequate idea
by the poor little translation which alone is possible to my
inferior nature.</p>

<p>Laying her hand kindly on Veritée's shoulder, she says, with
much of earnestness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear girl, the many proofs you give me during our studies of
your widening thought are just so many delights to my spirit. Your
aspirations are of the right order. There can be no <i>thoroughly,
desirable ambition which does not include benefit for the
unborn.</i> I am pleased very pleased, you begin to feel the
absolute necessity of <i>matured thought</i> in positions of such
enormous trust as that of governing humankind. None but youth and
ignorance think this power lies in youth. While looking at those
dreadful rocks of the past we shudder at the nearness of the danger
which threatened to again strand civilization. But you must not
think <i>all</i> women of those times were magnanimous. Too often
the oppressed became the very fiercest of oppressors. While
admiring the patient endurance and great good sense of the many
under their spirit-wearying burdens and indignities, we must be
just. There were also women whose ideas had so contracted in being
tyrannized over by littleminded husbands that they appeared to have
sunk below the average and ignorantly inflicted as much suffering
as did the lowest of men:&mdash;and thereby contributed in no small
degree to the long continued degraded condition of human kind."</p>

<p>Then, turning to her son, who had been attending to her words
with his whole mind:</p>

<p>"And you, loyal heart, you must not place <i>all</i> the men of
those rude ages in the same category. Console yourself amidst this
unfavourable introduction to your ancestors that there existed some
of quite amazing rectitude of thought, and who were also brave
enough to proclaim it, which was then very dangerous conduct.
Notably one Higinbotham, who lived in our own hemisphere far back
as the nineteenth century of the Age of Blood. He was a legislator
of unusual wisdom for that era; the originator of free education
for the young, and endeavoured to obtain from the other legislators
a partial recognition of woman's political rights. Of course his
attempt failed, because the brute was too generally dominant in
men's unformed minds and naturally the grand spirit of this
Higinbotham was so far beyond their very weak comprehensions that,
with feeble attempts at wit and noisy chattering, they threw the
measure out&mdash;much as monkeys would destroy valuable deeds
without at all knowing the great mischief they were doing. It has
often happened that the advanced minds in a community have been
considered to be fools by all the fools around them. But I feel a
pride in knowing that women never forgot his fearless endeavour to
gain justice for them&mdash;and this brings me to a most
interesting fact in geology. A marvellous accident, some called it
which furnished irrefutable proofs of the grand and wondrous truth
at present your study. But perhaps, Veritée, you have already told
him?"</p>

<p>"No: mother. It was, to myself, such a pleasure to learn it from
your own lips that I would not so deprive him." Frederick is about
to inquire, when his mother commences:</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>"ABOUT nine thousand years ago, when it had been decided to
build larger instruction galleries for giving increased facilities
to parents during their morning lectures, there arose some
difficulty as to a site, for the far-seeing ones objected to its
being central. Future generations would, they said, be incommoded,
and that is never the policy of such minds. At last they succeeded
in obtaining for the required purpose what was named 'The
Battlefield,' a tongue of land at the western end of Alethia.
Nearly two million years ago our country only formed the bottom to
a tempestuous sea, often exceedingly dangerous to navigators bound
from Australia to a group of islands (N.Z.) long since disappeared.
'Vulcan's Forge,' the little volcanic islet you are so fond of
watching, is believed to be the top of one of their loftiest
mountains, which was once covered with ice and snow. Then the
earth's orbit became gradually more elliptical, and the consequent
precession of the equinoxes changed the seasons. The Southern
Hemisphere slipped out of the world's strife, and, as if weary of
perverse ignorance, lay mourning and resting under a long glacial
period, similar to the present state of the Northern Hemisphere. In
due time the earth returned to its more spherical route.</p>

<p>"Again the seasons changed; but ancient Australia had sunk and
this country, our magnificent Alethia had risen. As the ages rolled
on, it became colonized by people who had made huge advance in
civilization. Many were ascendants of persons who had gained wealth
on the engulfed land of which they brought with them some
annals&mdash;very imperfect, as subsequent events proved. It was
supposed that somewhere near the west end of Alethia the old
bright&mdash;and you would say very wicked&mdash;city of Melbourne
had flourished for thousands of years in those far-off ages. And
now, the question was to be settled most wonderfully by this very
scheme for further instruction! The Battlefield was so named from
its having once been the scene of a frightful conflict between the
early Alethians and an invading army from the Northern Hemisphere.
In those times it had been very strongly fortified; but for
thousands of years peace had reigned over the world. In to-morrow's
lecture I will give you more information on 'war.' The immense
fortifications had long since fallen into ruins, and were
completely hidden&mdash;deeply buried under decayed vegetable
matter, in which grew dense shrubs and enormous trees. Geologists
urged the adoption of this site, because they knew the land around
was rising, and on that account could not be otherwise than a most
valuable position for coming generations. Those who are to-day
highest in the science declare that the whole of ancient Australia,
with extensive additional land, will yet&mdash;in the far
future&mdash;join Alethia, never again to sink. For choosing the
Battlefield another reason was adduced&mdash;the constant supply of
fresh air from the glorious ocean. So the fate of the grandly
solemn little forest was decided. The most powerful machines of the
age soon commenced the sad work of destruction; but how different
to those former ones whose cruel mechanism lay obscured and
powerless under nature's kindly growth! and how different the
destruction! The old poets sang sweetly and prophetically of the
great undertaking. They tell us how the continuous thunder of the
falling trees caused deep pain to many hearts. They thought of what
must have been that murderous roar, in which so many of their
ancestors had perished, while courageously defending their loved
country from fierce and ignorant invaders, who would have
brutalized them, and most surely would have mercilessly overthrown
their rapidly advancing institutions. In thrilling verse they told
them it was but a harmless echo from the past&mdash;<i>echo</i>,
only, of a wild beast roar. An echo which would hound from age to
age until it should become a most sweet music&mdash;the voices of
dear ones fitting themselves for a higher, and always higher,
hereafter. They said those beautiful fallen giants should be
replaced by other and grander ones&mdash;giants of culture and
truth!"</p>

<p>Enthusiasm has imparted additional light to this lustrous trio.
But my eyes grow dim with tears as my spirit tires from an intense
longing to be worthy of their bravely truthful age!</p>

<p>She continues:</p>

<p>"After many weeks of unceasing work, the ground was cleared of
all the magnificent growth, excepting a few fine cedars, purposely
left for the birds, where they congregated, and, to those who
understood them, made touching laments over their lost habitations.
Excavations for foundations commenced, which required more than
usual depth. For several days a quiet unassuming man had been
observed carefully examining the earth thrown up by the machines.
One morning he suddenly descended a trench, implored the men to
stop the engines and send for the manager. Then he removed the
crusher; and, kneeling, tore the soil away with his own hands,
growing more earnest with each handful he removed, delightedly
exclaiming, 'It is! It is!' When the manager arrived, he showed him
some carved stone he had succeeded in uncovering, and rapidly wrote
upon his card&mdash;'The past is coming to the present. Send a
hundred carpenters and material for about seventy diam. to secure
your great treasure.' Signed with a name which commanded respect,
though his hasty message afterwards caused much merriment, for it
was well known the 'past' had been very fierce and rapacious. The
quiet man who had so suddenly displayed such energy and direction
was a Cosmopola geologist, named Denton, far-famed for his
brilliant talents. It was proved that he had ascended from an
American of the same name, who lived thousands of thousands of
years before&mdash;who had been world-known for his great, good,
truthful mind. He had only arrived in Alethia the previous week,
having left his country in obedience to some powerful intuition.
His advice was acted upon, and soon a large shed covered the
treasure. A wise precaution to prevent hindrance the crowds would
otherwise have caused, for people were continually assembling near
the spot, some of whom offered payment to view the valuable statue
fast appearing. Fortunately, it had been placed under a massive
cupola so a small portion of that was the only part the machine had
broken. It stood on a large pedestal, which proved to be hollow,
and had been filled with the In-In records&mdash;so named from
having been written on indestructible material and with
ineffaceable ink. But language had so altered that the most able
linguists were occupied for many years in deciphering them. From
study of those writings, and others since discovered I learned all
I have told, and have yet to tell you, concerning our ancestor's
preceding and during the dawn of civilization, or Great Transition
Age, which included the terrible Christian Era up to the happier
time when true ethics began to stir all human kind to noble
thoughts, truthfulness and benevolence. To this day no person under
twenty-five years has once been permitted to examine those paining
records. The monument has this inscription:</p>

<p>"SCULPTURED AND ERECTED BY WOMEN,</p>

<p>"A.D. 2180, TO</p>

<p>"GEORGE HIGINBOTHAM,</p>

<p>"FRIEND TO WOMAN AND UNIVERSAL EDUCATION.</p>

<p>"You will see it next week. It is beautifully executed, and as
uninjured by time's changes as if it had been but this year's work.
Some people express regret we have not such marble now. I think it
as great a mistake as the other reset&mdash;that we have lost the
art of producing certain colours possessed by those people. In my
opinion, the hardness of the stone and the colours are both due to
some chemical change during long burial in the earth. Powerful
machinery had to be constructed to raise the treasure, which
increased public impatience, and great were the sums offered for
entry to the works. But the Government said there should be no
huckstering in connection with so noble a name and that all should
view it freely as soon as practicable. At last the day came. Such a
gathering never before, and never since, has been. From shore to
shore, and far away towards the then principal city, was one close
collection of people. While the appointed hour was chiming, the
cloth covering was removed by two of the humblest and two of the
highest women in Alethia. For a few seconds stillness reigned all
through that vast assemblage, and every head bowed towards the
statue. How different to the bow of ignorance to stone images not
two million years before! Then arose such a shout of welcome that
some said the great concussion made the figure move. There it
stands exactly where reverent voices that day greeted it. Not a
dissentient was heard to a proposal, by a senatress, that he should
be named the 'Primordial Founder of these Galleries.'"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>FREDERICK, whose eyes have been brightening as his mother's
recital proceeded, exclaims:</p>

<p>"How I should like to have been that grand old savage, thus to
live in memory of all ages, for justice! (Then reflectively) But,
dear mother, I cannot see why we should wait so many years before
we can be useful. Veritée has passed the standard, and in about a
year I expect to reach it. Yet we are to remain powerless in the
State for so many years longer!"</p>

<p>"True, my son, and most wisely is it so. When you have your
standard certificate, the most important part of your education
will commence. Knowledge of the world with its present and future
requirements; growth of justice and benevolence over impulse; and a
strength of judgment which only the watchful experience and earnest
reflection of many years could teach. If the guidance of human kind
were again given to youth, the world would once more be thrown back
to the nascent condition of youth; and (with an amused tone in her
voice) the older senators of <i>both</i> sexes would have to resort
to a third chamber that their wiser politics might not be disturbed
by the noise of un-thought ideas. I admire your homage to the grand
old savage, as you call him but that appellation was not well
chosen. For though he lived in a half-savage time, and was
surrounded by many who were nearly savages, he was one of the few
in advance of their era&mdash;not comprehended by the thoughtless
multitude. The first wave of a grand tide, bringing its treasures
to endure through all time."</p>

<p>She is interrupted by a voice through the telephone telling that
the desired alcove awaits occupancy.</p>

<p>They rise. Frederick takes his mother's hand, and says some
words I cannot interpret.</p>

<p>Veritée, half reflectively, as if looking into the perplexing
past:</p>

<p>"I always think our Founder must have been a bravely truthful
man to have so risked the hurt and ridicule of ignorance, which
appears to have been malignant all through the world's
history."</p>

<p>They walk through an opening leading to a passage formed by the
backs of the cases and wall of gallery.</p>

<p>Stopping suddenly, the elder lady says:</p>

<p>"You did not notice the figures in the case fronting our alcove;
but," walking on again, "it matters not now. I particularly wish to
descend the Ages in their own order. The alcove I intended to
commence in, this morning, was engaged."</p>

<p>"Yes," says Frederick, in an uninterested tone, "I saw them.
Some sort of monkey."</p>

<p>"Monkeys, my dear! You are thinking of some other case. They are
ancient Britons&mdash;<i>very</i> ancient&mdash;and modelled after
well-executed drawings."</p>

<p>"Indeed mother, I looked well at them. Naked, hairy vicious
animals, standing upon their hind legs. Please return, the alcove
is not yet occupied."</p>

<p>"There," says he as they arrive before the case, "are they not
apes?"</p>

<p>With a half serious, and somewhat of droll, expression in her
eyes, she replies gently:</p>

<p>"No, they were not so named, though there is certainly some
excuse for your doing so. They were always called Britons. However,
call them what you will&mdash;man or ape&mdash;they were the
progenitors of some of the greatest civilizers."</p>

<p>They retrace their steps, the boy with his former look of
indignation. It is evident he is not yet reconciled to his
ancestors.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>THEY enter the alcove, fully a third of a mile from where I have
remained watching them&mdash;happy to even see such beings. Truth,
freedom, love and grace are indeed here. I shall join them after
passing near the other families, and so give gladness to my "half
brutal" self in contemplation of this shamless refinement. No
glances of envy or tones of detraction. No slander. These must be
women of really high birth.</p>

<p>Where are the low Illiterate? The pompous, self-lauding,
arrogant ignorami? That great band so heavily weighting the Car of
Progress in my century! Not in any of these noble families! who
appear so affectionately and so reverently united by honest
endeavour for human perfection. Nowhere can I see the baleful,
cruel stamp of ignorance. Mothers and fathers are ably imparting
instruction to attentive&mdash;fascinatingly attentive&mdash;young
people in matters which, up to the nineteenth century, have been
left to chance study; and on other subjects beyond present
comprehension, with eloquence exceeding my power to transcribe; yet
causing so great an exaltation of my thought that I shudder at
contemplating the barbaric misconceptions and young-world
understandings awaiting my return to an unenlightened age.</p>

<p>While I linger occasionally, on my way up the gallery, to hear a
little from the lips of these beautiful, earnest truthseekers, I
learn the origin of their Instruction Galleries, and pride upholds
me upon finding that our Australia planted the seed of so goodly a
tree of knowledge. An example which was followed by countries in
the Northern Hemisphere, where the principle became an institution
during thousands of years, and ultimately was established with
increased culture in this newer land, Alethia.</p>

<p>Soon after women entered Parliament, they brought forward a
measure compelling either mothers or fathers to devote two mornings
of every week&mdash;commencing Sunday&mdash;to oral instruction of
their children. They argued that it would restore the too often
overstrained mental power of both teachers and pupils, besides
arresting premature decay of sight, frequently caused by too
continuous application to books at an early age. Added to which
important considerations, they urged the value of such a law as a
means for strengthening family ties, by increasing the loving
respect of children for their parents. After a very short debate,
the measure received the authority of the House by unanimous
voting. The few progressionists supported it of course, and the
ignorant ones, also of course, because they believed it must
ultimately rid them of woman's quieting presence in the senate. And
much they chuckled, with silly jokes, over what their wisdom
considered to be woman's stupidity in thus forging chains for
herself. For it afterwards transpired that they had fully intended
all the obligation of the act should be borne by the originators of
it. On their side, the women were prepared to execute the desirable
work. It was nothing to them to do more than their fair share ever
since beasts on two legs first ordered their female mates to carry
logs for their fire, while they employed the great intellect man
has always accredited himself with in extracting grubs, and other
such dainties, for the gratification of their own appetite, or
lolling in company with other great male intellects around lovely
pools of water; intellect consisting in brutal strength of legs and
arms, the reflection of which gave them immense selfesteem as they
lay contemplating and planning anew some cruel discomfort or
privation for their weaker halves&mdash;the real
workers!&mdash;who, in addition to other toil, had that of rearing
fresh beasts.</p>

<p>In the words of a gentleman relating this to his son:</p>

<p>"So those bravely good women, in the era you despise, entered
upon their task. Think, boy, what must have been the requisite
energy and patience. Unaided, in nearly every family, they fully
satisfied the law's exactions&mdash;a law which has proved the
greatest regenerating influence over human kind yet known to the
world."</p>

<p>And, according to this same gentleman, performed their task so
earnestly and conscientiously that, as century after century rolled
away, the little band of noble men, honorably anxious to assist
woman in her rise, increased to powerful numbers.</p>

<p>At first, like most innovations, the measure was not welcomed in
every family. It pressed hardly upon women who had previously
misused intellect in worthless studies, to the exclusion of
philosophical reading and elevating thought. But the difficulties
gradually wore down. In teaching others, they acquired more
knowledge; and science, too, became woman's staunch friend. There
was less beast and greater intelligence on earth. Wisdom became an
easier lesson. Life was more honestly conducted; more simple habits
grew&mdash;both in food and dress, which, being met half way by
scientific appliances, the useless, menial drudgery self-imposed by
humans was a thing of the ignorant past&mdash;in the very far-off
age, of which I endeavour to give my vision as it has been given to
my eyes and understanding.</p>

<p>As time grew men became educated from their apathy, and freely
aided the women to the fullest extent of their power. They also
introduced a measure for the erection of State galleries, in which
the morning studies or lectures were to be continued after the
children should have attained the age of sixteen or seventeen
years, no admittance being permitted under that age. Such mornings
there to be devoted to physiology, evolution, geology, mythology,
&amp;c., imparted in the manner I am now observing.</p>

<p>The two mornings of this week are occupied on evolution.
Wherever I pass, the subject is being earnestly discussed; and it
seems to be a very displeasing accession of knowledge to all the
young students.</p>

<p>I am now opposite an alcove, in which are mother, father and two
sons. The youngest says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I regret, dear mother and father, having caused you so much
trouble in proving our ascent from such bestial thought and matter;
but I promise to give you no difficulty concerning our still more
remote progenitors you speak of, for the difference between
ourselves and those ferocious men of the merciless Christian era is
so great that there cannot be much further descent to master."</p>

<p>Gravely his father replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In those words, my son, I grieve to read yet something
remaining of your origin. They betray just a trace of the vanity
which so perniciously opposed justice and progress in that
transition age. It forms the one great lesson learnt from our
valuable records. The nearer we approach the primordial savage the
greater the amount of vanity we find. None can say either the
immense length of time required to bring humankind even to the
stage of improvement, with which you feel so dissatisfied or the
probably still longer period to come during which progress will
continue. At some future time our structure will have so changed to
one nearer perfection that when we look back over the wonderful
history of humankind during the course of evolution, as we do
to-day, we shall no more recognize our present selves than you feel
inclined to do in the ruder forms of the Christian era. But I am
inclined to think that the youth of that time will feel only
admiration and reverence, as the wise designs of the Infinite Mind
become more distinct to growing reason. Do not mistake this, my
boy. I imply no blame for your condemnation of those unfortunately
selfish men. And (looking tenderly at the dear mother) we much
admire your spirit-stirred sympathy for the oppressed condition of
the women; but we wish you to take a more philosophical view of
past imperfections. It matters not how faulty were their ethics, if
they <i>consistently</i> and <i>conscientiously</i> founded their
conduct upon them. This is what we can never know. We ought not to
condemn them for believing that <i>right</i> which they had not
sense enough to learn was so very, very wrong."</p>

<p>Son: "With time, father, I shall no doubt think as you and my
dear mother so kindly and so patiently work to guide my thought,
because all your counsel has been nobly just. I will reflect well
over this, your most difficult lecture. You say our structure may
change. Think you our present formation could be improved?"</p>

<p>Father: "Who can deny it? We are certainly not mind perfect. Why
should we consider our body incapable of improvement? By the
ancient records I find that those men we have been considering,
whose form more resembles that of the ape than our own, thought as
you do on this question. Their self-idolatry was even amusing. They
were so overweening that in speaking of their shape, which was
often distorted by excesses, they called it the 'human form
divine.' That idea was peculiarly man's. The males of all species
have ever been paramount in vanity; and before we can approach a
nearer stage to perfection, yet more vanity must wear from our
nature."</p>

<p>Reluctantly I leave this family, for the mother now speaks; but
I wish to join my favorites.</p>

<p>Slowly I pass each alcove. It is not possible to miss glancing
at these sweet faces. Still the same lesson goes on, in differing
words, to shocked young ears. Though I cannot marvel that it is so,
I sigh humbly to see how averse they are to owning relationship to
us!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>A MIRTHFUL laugh now comes pleasantly to arouse me from sad
reflection. It is from two lads, while their mother smilingly
endeavours to restrain them. Before their alcove is a case
containing models of steamengines and electric motors of the
twenty-second, twentyfirst and twentieth centuries. She has just
been explaining concerning our screeching, dirty "iron horses" and
the picture of a "few hundreds of miles'" journey in so "wild" a
fashion greatly excites their amusement, especially at "the strange
noises those semi-barbarians loved to hear around them." I doubt
the restoration of their gravity this morning. They listen
respectfully while she tells them that but for the intellect which
produced those "cumbrous machines, two millions of years ago, our
own elegant, convenient noiseless and rapid conveyances would not
yet have been arrived at."</p>

<p>But their splendid eyes are dancing with humour at their
imaginings of the "journeys in the poor old past, with those
strange, funny-looking beings for companions!" and they break out
again into a most enlivening laugh. I wish they could know how
heartily I join them!</p>

<p>There will be a different expression on their faces tomorrow,
when they hear of the frightful sufferings those same "funny wild
engines" sometimes caused. In most cases by men's alarming
deficiency in forethought and union of particulars, which is daily
to be seen both in the higher and lesser duties of their
positions.</p>

<p>Electric motors are now being discussed. To my uneducated
comprehension they appear wondrous specimens of mechanism and
superior work, as do many other things here exhibited, the use of
which I cannot define. They are entirely unknown to us. But the
children&mdash;"Children"! I am the only child amongst these young
people, though they have so few years compared with mine&mdash;they
laugh goodnaturedly at the efforts of "infant science." The younger
one declares, with mirth in his musical voice, that if such
"monstrosities" had continued in use up to his time, he "would have
petitioned all scientists to combine their intellect for extension
of the atmosphere, or for the invention of something by means of
which we could journey safely outside it. Otherwise there would
never have been room sufficient for all the air travellers of our
era."</p>

<p>Then their mother tells them how, by the unswerving law of
correlation, inventions began to lose their crude form and
imperfections from the time men began to lose their brute vanity.
"When they acknowledged, in the justice born of their improved
minds, that women were also <i>humans</i>, and not of a lower
species&mdash;made for man's comfort or amusement&mdash;as the
strutting, ignorant creatures used to tell each other. They had
kept women uncultured on every scientific or mechanical subject,
while they gave themselves extraordinary and exclusive privileges
for acquirement of all such learning. Then, with their usual faulty
logic on most things relating to women, declared she had no
mechanical ability or inventive talent, in proof of which assertion
they audaciously asked what she had done to evince any! Yet, with
all their advantages, very few, out of the countless millions born,
rose above what was considered only mediocrity, even in their own
egotistical age. Those lamentably foolish men were too blind with
selflaudation to see the dormant talent of their women, evidenced
in very many minor works throughout the daily menial and severe
labour allotted to them. But a time arrived when mechanics, as also
every other study, became as essential for women as for men. Then
was gloriously proved the fallacy of sex in mind&mdash;a tenet
hitherto held firmly by men since its foundation by the first vain
ape who declared the Infinite Mind was of his sex. Woman's
inventive faculty cultivated gave an immense stride in the progress
of mechanics; for good, like ill, both acts and reacts. As
universal study went on, more talented people were born to bless
human kind to distant ages, and thus continue to the higher and
purer future."</p>

<p>It has been a delighting study to trace the effects of their
mother's words on the handsome faces of these dear young fellows,
becoming more earnestly attentive with each idea she uttered. The
enthusiasm which had begun to glow is now softening to compassion,
while she tells them that, "notwithstanding none but the most
skilled men guided those machines, they frequently collided several
hundred feet above the ground, and went crashing through the
air&mdash;a burning tangled mass! Corpses sometimes fell upon
living persons in the streets, adding to the dread scene of cruel
deaths."</p>

<p>She pauses; all are sorrowfully silent. After a few seconds she
continues in more cheerful tone:</p>

<p>"As you know, such occurrences are now impossible, unless from
carelessness of great magnitude. And this our safety we owe to
educated woman. One, who had given much time to scientific
subjects, suggested the use of the Repelling Current. She and her
comrade constructed two air carriages, fitted with the now
well-known Repellor; and, each occupying one, bravely made the
first trial of their work, to the clamorous delight of all who had
sufficient nerve to await the result; though it is recorded that
many closed their eyes, and others ran hurriedly away when they saw
the vehicles approaching each the other in a direct line and with a
speed never previously attained. We know how beautifully the
controlled current acts. After several trials had fully proved the
accuracy of the invention, the crowd began to realize its value to
human life, and simultaneously all uttered a sound of thankfulness,
which had a very harmonious effect. Then gratitude stirred every
heart there present, and men resolved the now famous carriages
should not touch the ground when they descended, but be lovingly
received in their arms; and, despite the merry protests of their
happy occupants, were so carried in triumph around the city, while
thousands followed, singing a popular song on victorious science.
Contrast that with those paeans of victory in the long-past
murderous times, before woman was known to be a human being! And
the procession&mdash;how different to the debased congregations,
scarcely two millions of years before, following an image of one of
their deities, all wildly shouting while dancing with bestial glee
and apelike antics about the wretched victims&mdash;who were often
young girls and boys&mdash;about to be sacrified in the holy name
of religion! An unholy excuse for murder and cruelty, which lasted,
in various forms, to the end of the Christian era. Professedly an
era of goodwill! At the end of their unexpected journey, both
carriages were heaped with costly gifts, thrown in by the more
wealthy of the crowd. Although people were not quite so
noble-minded as they are to-day, those two heroic workers in the
cause of humanity received the honor due to their enterprise with
great humility. Government offered monetary acknowledgment to the
inventress. She refused, saying she would feel shame in being paid
for the happiness of saving life. Determined to reward her, they
appointed her Investigatress of Electric Works, which she likewise
refused, because, she said, it would equally shame her to be placed
in a higher position than her comrade for a 'mere intuition,' to
which she had been enabled to give practical effect only by their
<i>combined thought</i>. So both of them were raised to the post.
This is the origin of so many of our highest offices now being
filled by both woman and man, for it soon became a well-known fact
that all thought is more perfect when combined with that of the
opposite sex. A truth which, strangely enough, was in the minds of
the oldest Pagans of whom we have record; for one of their myths
was that humans were originally woman and man joined together; but
their chief god found them so powerful thus formed that he severed
them&mdash;and then followed every earthly disaster."</p>

<p>The recital has made this happy little party very bright.
Wottah, the younger boy, prettily thanks his mother for "so
pleasant a relief to all those Christian ferocities," and he
wonders "how those good people, as the brutes called themselves,
would have rewarded our courageous couple." Smilingly, the lady
replies:</p>

<p>"In the early part of that era, when a woman was incautious
enough to let men know she was an intellectual being, they called
her 'witch,' and (with pathetic hesitancy in her voice) she was
either drowned in putrid water or burnt to death. A few centuries
later, a woman of culture was simply insulted; not only by the
opposing sex, but by those of her own, who were either not so
gifted, or had not exercised the power of thought&mdash;which is
the heritage of all. Later still, men quietly ignored whatever
woman did to prove her mental equality, but, at the same time,
indefatigably kept before public eyes any intellectual achievement
by one of their own sex: and considered they efficiently proved
their own superiority when they told her she was inferior. Men of
some mental power, but very deficient in integrity, fouled their
pens by writing defamatory or fatuous articles scorning woman's
righteous appeal for her share in legislation for human
kind&mdash;which writings, like other unclean things, defiled all
who placed credence in them. Those who had most to fear from her
discovery of their malpractices went so far as to assert that woman
was too deficient in morality and conscientiousness for sharing in
the government of the world."</p>

<p>The elder son, reflectively:</p>

<p>"From brutes one ought not to be astonished at meeting with
brutality&mdash;but in my thought of the unhappy past what so
perplexes me is that men who possessed some intellect should have
been so obtuse as to keep women in that disastrous state of slavish
oppression. Why, even the rude mechanical knowledge they possessed
was sufficient to have taught them that no whole can be perfect
when only half is cared for; and that it matters not bow
beautifully such half be polished and cherished&mdash;if to the
neglect of the other, the ruin of the entirety must follow."</p>

<p>Looking very affectionately at her noble boy, she replies:</p>

<p>"Your quick perception and apt definition always reward me for
the pain of going over the sad past. You are right, dear, the ruin
did come, repeatedly. Nation after nation fell. Whole races
dwindled in intellect, and sunk irretrievably. Some historians
assigned one cause&mdash;some, widely differing ones; but male
vanity was so strong that it required the extinction of many
peoples before the real reason could be understood by men. And then
they had to be taught it by the very half whose abstract reasoning
and abstract justice was thus proved to have been not only
equal&mdash;which some of their most learned men
denied[*]&mdash;but superior to their own.

<p class="footnote">[See Herbert Spencer's <i>Study of Sociology</i>.]

<p>That iniquities should
have existed is not perplexing when we reflect that&mdash;save in
the great few&mdash;intellect developed without corresponding
increase of integrity and benevolence. Some naturalists say all
their contemptible tyranny arose solely from an inherent fear of
subjugation&mdash;and I think it feasible, because, in the earliest
ages, men took as wives&mdash;a word signifying servants, or rather
slaves&mdash;the women whom they captured in battle. Fearing the
unfortunate creatures might revolt, and make cause with their own
kin, they kept them in cruel subjection, and treated them as if
they had been still their enemies. Of course, that tyrannical
feeling was transmitted through millions of generations, so it is
not difficult to comprehend the enormous length of time which must
elapse before it could be obliterated by one of justice. The marvel
would have been that out of such a state of vain ignorance the
least nobility could ever have arisen, did we not feel the
indestructible power of Right. Wonderful in all its works, but not
yet understood by our limited minds, though we have now reason
enough to know they will be still more developed as evolution
further and further unfolds its marvels."</p>

<p>There is no resemblance between the mother of these boys and
Frederick's, except in the general expression of truthfulness and
reliability. She is more vivacious in her beauty, and ever ready to
join in their laughter. Probably this is because her children have
not been so difficult to instruct in what appears to be everywhere
an unpleasant lesson. They are evidently lads of an advanced
intelligence. The knowledge of their relationship to us is received
with more philosophical equanimity than I have yet met with; and,
except during the relation of any sad anecdote, which she uses to
steady their thought, are more inclined to mirth than sorrow. I
suppose they are of the more progressive ones of their age.</p>

<p>Wottah's eyes are sparkling with some fresh amusement in his
mind, as he says:</p>

<p>"I wonder what we three would now have been, had there never
existed any earnest women,&mdash;and noble men like our
Founder?"</p>

<p>Felix, the elder son, in obedience to a sign from his mother,
replies:</p>

<p>"What we should have been? Well, where are only fools and brutes
there must be only folly and cruelty. Change being Nature's great
abiding law, nothing is inert. If no progress can be effected, a
fall must come to recommence the rise:&mdash;So I think human kind
would have inevitably receded. Possibly tails would have become
general again, and at this moment you and I would most probably
have been holding to a branch with ours, endeavouring piously to
hurt our dear mother, or some other person, with the least
possibility of danger to our own valuable selves."</p>

<p>I leave them all merrily laughing at Felix's grave imitation of
a lecture.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>ON quitting the last group, I had resolved no other enticement
should detain me from the first darlings of my acquaintance; but
here is a large case of fashions, and it is customary to swerve a
little in that cause. I care not who knows how great its interest
for my mind. Fashion is a subject upon which I have thought very
earnestly for many years, and know too well the powerful influence
it exerts over the right and wrong of both present and future time.
Indeed, I see it is one of the principal factors of the numerous
chaotic minds now steadfastly pursuing their course of omissive
sinning.</p>

<p>Faithfully modelled before me are many curiously-habited
humans&mdash;quite savage and partly savage. Here are the gloomy
Puritans, also the over-magnificent Cavalier. The rigid Quaker.
Women who dwindled themselves to look like a dressed stick. Others
who inflated their coverings until they resembled a barrel carrying
a scarcely human head. Others with that portion of their
body&mdash;which is generally considered naturally very
exuberant&mdash;swelled into an appearance most monstrous and
repulsive. A wretched sight to contemplate, because it is the
result of weakened power to use the intelligence they are striving
to drive from their minds. And&mdash;yes, there you are, my
hideously-shaped contemporary! Little stilts under your boots,
giving you a penguin-out-of-water appearance. Your swaddling
clothes. Your abnormally swelled hips. Your ribs bent into the
place nature intended only for delicate organs, the perfect health
of which is requisite for healthy mind. Your crooked shoulders, the
result of vain endeavours to move and breathe easily under so
idiotic a <i>régime</i>. Your painted cheeks. Your black daubs over
eyebrows,&mdash;the repulsive dirty sham plainly lying on the skin
between the hairs. And a fitting crown to all that degrading
deception is the impure false hair, which you imagine
<i>decorates</i> your narrowed, distorted-looking head&mdash;a head
Nature intended should have been intellectual, kind and truthful in
form.</p>

<p>And there you are, likewise, hideous young man contemporary!
Stilts under your boots. Ungraceful clothes. Hair cut in patterns
on face to resemble the natural growth of your ape-relative's
whiskers. Head shorn of its ornamental covering, leaving the ears
standing out resembling ugly handles to an ugly bowl; altogether
giving the unfortunate owner an appearance of having been modelled
while in the crisis of a dangerous disease.</p>

<p>Worthy male for such a female, to the world's distraction! For
how can aught but retrogression proceed from the union of two such
fools! Oh, women! awaken to your responsibilities. Be it plainly
understood I address only those whose type is in this case for a
far-off age to learn what shams they are. Abandon your shameful
practical lying. Where is the benefit it brings you? No mental
improvement. No physical beauty. It only begets the shortlived
admiration of semi-idiots, or the worship of deceived boys, whose
inevitable enlightenment brings so fierce a contempt for the whole
of our sex, that I have known it last until it became part of
nature&mdash;not, alas! to be uprooted by even honourable and
truthful women. Should you marry any so deceived is it possible you
could expect your husbands to respect women who would sink to such
pitiful means to win them? These are some of the great world
troubles your thoughtless shams bring upon human kind. You thereby
strengthen man's injustice towards women, and while that continues
no progress can take deep root. It should always be the aim of
woman to rise from the degrading position assigned her in the age
of bestial ignorance and brute power. To rise, by noble thought and
act, until man, in very shame, yield her her fair share of world's
advantages, which he continues to usurp, partly from ignorance and
partly from little-mindedness, but always blindly as to the wrong
he is working to the whole of the human species.</p>

<p>Away with your shams! Be no longer encouraged by cunning men to
waste your energies on the absurd and injurious reduction of your
waists, or the set of bows, &amp;c. They do so to thus basely
dwindle your nobility of nature, that you may become their
weak-brained tools instead of their equals. This world is ours as
much as men's. They have no greater right to it than we have. Oh,
women! how can you sit inanely smiling over the fashion of a dress
or other paltriness while man makes laws affecting you and your
children&mdash;the dear children you are rearing with your
blood&mdash;as he does over any other animal he possesses? His laws
are that he may take your child from you, give it to strangers'
care, rear it in rascality if it so suit his purposes, and finally
<i>will</i> it from you. The husband cowardly enough to defame his
wife can do so with impunity. Those other base curs who repeat his
untruths are also able to gratify their dirty inclinations. You
have no legal redress, wives! Man's laws are for his own safety and
glorification in all matters. It was not many years since a law
existed in England regulating the <i>thickness of the stick</i>
with which a man might <i>legally beat his wife</i>. Our divorce
records show that alarming brutality, and the greatest of
immoralities on the man's part, have not constituted "sufficient
cause" for breaking such devilish bonds. Awake, women! Be fooled no
longer! Examine man's sapient laws! You will be amazed at their
rubbish and injustice. Especially after their having told you for
thousands of years how wise and moral they are. Read them! Find out
the extent of their <i>reason</i> and <i>justice</i>! It will be a
revelation to you which will eventually have most beneficial
results for human kind. They prevent you from learning and
reflecting upon important subjects by flattering your sillinesses,
and encouraging you to waste thought and time in trifles. Step out
of the contemptible groove! Learn&mdash;above that, <i>think</i>,
and you will soon claim your right to legislate for yourselves. Man
has neither the <i>right</i> nor the <i>ability</i> to make laws in
which the happiness and health of our lives are concerned, unless
with our cooperation.</p>

<p>It is as unjust as if we were to legislate on man's greatest
interests without consulting him; though I feel certain the very
worst of us would do so in a far greater spirit of justice and
benevolence than he has manifested in his cruel, impertinent and
ignorant laws on our sex. Laws which have broken or withered
millions of loving hearts, though medical men have called those
murders by less conspicuous names.</p>

<p>It was only natural that so savage and selfish a being as man
should have originally usurped all power over the weaker by reason
of his greater brute strength; but that is no proof of larger mind.
The tiger could crush the strongest man. Yet I think not a single
man would give the palm for mind to the tiger. To beat, kick and
trample on a weaker body is no proof of superiority of intellect;
but it is by such means that men have claimed it. It is not
astonishing that the vanity of those semi-brutes in the past closed
women's mouths, crippled her intellectual exertions, enacted that
she had not enough brain to learn, and availed themselves of every
means "divine"&mdash;so they "piously" called it&mdash;or any
other, to degrade the muscularly weaker sex, and that they should
have promulgated theories, unsound as conceited, laudatory of the
greater brute; but now that there has grown higher intellect in all
human kind, it is full time men should repair, as far as possible,
those most calamitous injuries to our species which have been
brought about through their selfish devotion to the lack-brain
errors of our ancestors. Ever since the first important record of
men's speech they have branded women as false, illogical, immoral
and weakminded. Whenever they wish to very much insult one of their
own sex they liken him to a woman. Anybody who reads current
literature frequently sees the following sickeningly ignorant
phrases, disgracing manhood and what, in other respects, are
cleverly-written articles:&mdash;"Scolding like an enraged Woman,"
"With truly feminine vindictiveness," "Woman's tongue, never
still," "Illogical as a woman," and many similar which most people
have seen, and, excepting small-brained males, are quite weary of
seeing. And all this unmerited abuse of unoffending woman is
unfailingly given when public men choose to quarrel or wrangle over
some little matter, which, unfortunately for woman's prestige, is
very frequently; as in senate, bar and pulpit&mdash;the three
public educators, they tell us&mdash;there is always abundance of
scolding. Pass inns&mdash;<i>men</i> babbling nonsense or scolding.
Go through the streets&mdash;everywhere <i>men's</i> tongues; very
little of women's. Listen while journeying in train, 'bus or
steamer, waiting anywhere&mdash;the <i>men</i> are the talkers.
And, if you care to listen, you will find it mostly stupid verbiage
they utter. Then they go home and say to their energetically busy
wives what men consider smart things about "woman's tongue,"
"feminine cackle," &amp;c. Men have the audacity to call us
deficient in reason! Examine their vaunted ideas! You will laugh
till probably tears of sorrowing pity fill your eyes at their
constant exposition of their own lack of it. They began all things
unreasonably&mdash;a round of absurdities and impossibilities for
the abasement of the defenceless half of human kind, in the
unreasonable imagining that they thereby exalted the other half;
and to carry out their unreason they made their god
unreasonable!</p>

<p>They call us immoral! Were we one-thousandth part so immoral as
they themselves are the world would be worse than any or all things
in Dante's hell!</p>

<p>They have so hedged us with the legality of their own
immorality, that the most virtuous lady smilingly receives our
Solomons and Davids without a misgiving, or thinking how her house
is polluted by their presence. But let their victims come to her
door, or accidentally brush against her, she would shudderingly
spurn them&mdash;to further ruin. Her Solomon husband and David
friend would at once set about constructing laws for her
deliverance from so intolerable an abomination. They would call out
the judicial and clerical police to clear the street. Away with the
poor creatures to esoteric, shameful, humiliating usefulness! Away
with them to some retreat where the Solomons and Davids can find
them with least injury to their own sacred persons!</p>

<p>But should the unfortunates leave their allotted
boundary&mdash;driven, maybe, by fierce hunger for bread&mdash;to
carry on the vile trade men have forced them into, then, exoteric
Justice, bustle up to your bench of wisdom, fouled by so much of
wrong and idiocy! Have those poor profaned bodies seized! Men have
so seared their hearts it matters little about breaking a few!
Fine, imprison, insult the wretched beings! Rid the earth of them,
that fresh, less-jaded victims may take their places! But, my
worthy judicial and clerical masters, let no harm come to the
cowardly factors of all this maddening impurity&mdash;the real
prostitutes&mdash;the men! For they tell us they were made in the
image of their God. They are wanted in their churches to look
respectable&mdash;and worship Solomon.</p>

<p>Not very long ago a young girl sought judicial protection from
ruffians who had treated her in so cruelly debasing a way that
could we have records of early man's morality they could contain
nothing worse, probably not so infamous.</p>

<p>The acts were not denied. For defence it was made known that she
had been cohabiting with another of this brute type, <i>who aided
the others in the performance of their bestial deeds.</i> That was
sufficient for the beneficent wisdom of our Dogberries. Cast her to
perdition! But save those righteous young Solomons! Soon they will
be of law-making age!</p>

<p>Oh, women of pure lives, have you thought enough to think what
was the fate of that child&mdash;she was only sixteen&mdash;when
she left the court of <i>justice</i>, after hearing the heartless
decree? Reflect what is her life now; and if you have left your
hearts room enough for blood, they must bleed at such imaginings.
Should the hunted girl kill one of her assailants, she would be
hanged. I think we all agree that <i>any death</i> would be better
than the dreadful life to which the judicial and most unbenevolent
idiots doomed her. Women abandon your injurious style of clothing!
Allow your physical organs to have room for healthy life, that your
minds may expand. Work all you can to stop these egotistical dolts
from legislating for us without our aid! They cannot do it justly,
or with any good to the world.</p>

<p>If Solomons and Davids read what I have written, they will cry
with true Pharisaical screech&mdash;a tone too familiar to our
ears&mdash;"Shameful, that woman should meddle in such unwomanly
matters! Down with her! Respectability, tread upon her! Avoid her!
She is dangerous, &amp;c.!" And so she is, to all that is
exoterically good&mdash;but so false and foul within.</p>

<p>It is time to throw aside artificial modesty, all of you! I tell
you, women, it <i>is</i> woman's duty to try to save, help and
<i>raise</i> woman&mdash;it matters not how fallen. You know too
well such wrongs exist. To feign ignorance and practise
<i>indolence of thought</i> is not virtue. If any of you are really
ignorant of the deplorable sink into which so many thousands of our
sex have been plunged, and from which they now find it impossible
to rise, seek the truth for yourselves. It is right you should know
it; and as you value the <i>purity</i> and <i>welfare of your
daughters</i>, and your spirit's happiness when it shall have left
its present abode, do your best to redeem and comfort those poor
creatures. Not with vicious dogmas, or wearying, witless traditions
of our apelike ancestors, but with woman's pitying, helping love
for the helpless and defenceless. Remember they are women, with
woman's feelings&mdash;having woman's nature to suffer and endure
heroically. Alas, so crushed!&mdash;But only <i>crushed</i>. They
could rise from all their sad mistakes and wretchedness if you
would but hold a hand to them. And you, especially, who possess
wealth and influence with, happily for yourselves, time to effect
such good work. You are the women who could most accomplish. The
noble among men would help you in this, as in every other noble
effort for the world's advancement; but at present their numbers
are so small, compared with the Solomons, that they could do little
without your earnest co-operation. An association which has lately
been formed for helping young mothers is one great step.</p>

<p>Resolve, women! Act energetically to aid our poor sisters, or
how will you bear the company of their sad spirits when all meet in
another life, each alike divested of everything earthly, having
only thought and memory remaining? Let us work while we have the
power! Build a refuge&mdash;to be both school and home&mdash;but
into which let no "myth-men" or other myth-teachers enter, to
preach and weary the poor refugees into monotony and bewilderment
with vain endeavors to think over, and believe in, the unreasonable
or impossible. Show them good, and awaken reverence for good by
your own acts.</p>

<p>After a certain time shall have elapsed, employ them. There
would, doubtless, be some failures, though I think not many. Women
are not inherently depraved. They do not sink by predetermination.
Circumstances have placed young girls in danger&mdash;mere children
in mind-growth, while their bodies have attained earlier
maturity&mdash;or girls left without requisite care and
<i>instruction</i> at an important age. These are some of the
causes which have brought women to a mode of living they afterwards
loathed; but forced by the "virtuous" world to remain and suffer.
Think how very bitter must be such suffering. Those are the ones
who could be helped to a good and happy life.</p>

<p>When you commence the urgent work&mdash;and I believe it will be
commenced, for the prosperous and fortunate are more thoughtless
than radically selfish&mdash;you will find my subscription ready,
and if you all give in like proportion to your means, this new
monument of woman's womanliness will quickly be raised to bless the
world!</p>

<p>Men call us "weak-minded," and unfit for mental labour, That
such women as George Eliot and Mary Somerville, without naming many
other talented, studious women, should have compelled even men to
acknowledge their talents&mdash;that they should have risen to
public estimation straight through the deadly weight of ignorant
men's prejudice&mdash;proves quite the contrary. In Mary
Somerville's case it was considered so very unfeminine for a woman
to cultivate her intellect that they deprived her of light in the
winter evenings, to prevent her studying; but had she been of the
other sex every facility would have been gladly given, and then the
boasting of those abilities would have lasted as long&mdash;well,
as long as male boasting always lasts when a clever mind of that
sex appears. And we all know how few they have&mdash;considering
the millions of millions of men who have been born, and had the
advantage of their sex to attain what height they could! Had they
the amazing excellence in reason they are ever telling us of, they
would know why they have so miserably failed to occupy the great
mental positions they ought, by this era, to have reached.</p>

<p>It is only a few years since women were permitted to join men in
the race for education's honours&mdash;yet, how they already
disprove the male libel that they have no power for study! When our
University of Melbourne opened to women, the first who passed and
gained the highest honour was scarcely fifteen years of age. Though
men are inclined to keep woman's progress as unknown as possible;
in spite of all precautions, the girls' successes are sometimes
published&mdash;thanks to large-minded editors, whose thought has
taught them valuable lessons in the world's economy. Wherever women
are permitted to compete with men the result is amusingly
favourable to our sex, when we reflect how pitiably we have been
kept by man's doltish enactments imprisoned in one narrow,
senseless groove for&mdash;who knows how many hundreds of thousands
of years?</p>

<p>There are some men who, wishing to excuse the past irrational
action of their own sex, say:&mdash;"However right it was
<i>once</i> to rule over women, it is no longer so, &amp;c." It was
<i>never</i> 'right.' If the sexes had started on equal terms the
general mind would have sooner expanded, and the beautiful earth
would not have been saturated with the blood of advanced thinkers,
who have been courageously honourable enough to try to benefit
human kind by the honest avowal of their opinions. Women, all,
shake off the dangerous apathy into which man's ignorance has
thrown you! Teach them, or the earth will again have to treasure
away for future learners relics of another fallen
nation&mdash;teach them no whole can long exist if only one half of
it be cared for! It is time men's suicidal oppression should cease.
That it <i>will</i> do so is certain, for all the Infinite's works
result in perfection, and there can be none in human kind until man
become just to woman as to his own sex.</p>

<p>It rests with you whether it shall be soon or late. The sooner
you work towards so desirable a completion of wise designs&mdash;by
rejection of absurdities which have been thrust upon your
understanding, and by firm, sensible claim to your rights as
humans&mdash;the sooner must they yield what they have so long
deprived us of&mdash;our <i>equal share in the world's
advantages;</i> which world is ours, by all moral right, as much as
it is theirs.</p>

<p>I write not for myself. Man's tyrannical laws are powerless to
wound me more. <i>My</i> suffering has been borne. No alteration of
laws could now benefit me; but there are thousands enduring the
pain I have experienced through man's injustice, and thousands to
follow, until there be <i>just legislation</i>. For those&mdash;for
the progress of all human kind&mdash;I strive, and will continue to
do so while power be left me to speak or hold my pen.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>INSENSIBLY my spirit had flown to what these truly noble people
call the "Age of Blood." A delicious feeling of rest, safety and
trust comes into my aching heart as I find myself return to happier
surroundings. And the great pain some memories had brought vanished
with my entrance into the alcove facing the case of fashionable
simpletons.</p>

<p>Here are two lovely girls, between 16 and 17 years old,
expressing their objection to evolution. They are cousins. The
mother of one instructs them. Judging by the flashes of indignation
in their sweet eyes, and the expression of their truthful mouths,
this lady has no easy task.</p>

<p>They are looking at two models labelled "Slaves Civilized and
Uncivilized." Of these models one has too much clothing over part
of her, and absolutely none over the most delicate portion of her
body. She is our benightened, dedizened, bare-shouldered
bare-breasted, ball-room simpleton. Too well I recognize you! Years
ago I have watched you with my young mind full of wonderment and
pity. Thoughtless girl! worse than thoughtless mother! cover
yourselves. If your sense of decency is not sufficient, at least,
do so for protection of your lungs, and in mercy for the
unborn.</p>

<p>The other a beautiful half-caste is rather more naked&mdash;but
oh, how much more graceful is her form, which has never been
distorted by rib-squeezers! and her face so modest with its
expression of despairing shame&mdash;while she undergoes this cruel
exposure at her brutal master's bidding.</p>

<p>One of the students opens the volume of explanations. Her mother
is evidently reluctant to give the first instruction, for she says:
"Read aloud, my Consuelo."</p>

<p>The girl obeys:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two women decked for sale&mdash;the bondwoman compulsorily, the
civilized lady voluntarily displaying charms of person for men's
purchase."</p>

<p>She can read no further. Her face and throat are crimson with
indignation. A tone of mingled pain and sympathy is in her rich
voice as site exclaims: "Base and shameful! Oh, dear mother, could
such monstrous wrongs have been?" And the other, a grand-looking
girl, having eyes promising great power of thought, adds: "My loved
and most good aunt, I like not this revolting study&mdash;if we are
to believe these bestial beings belonged to our species. I do
really think they could not have been human. Certainly there is a
caricaturing resemblance, but they are not shaped like
ourselves."</p>

<p>At these suggestive words Consuelo looks hopefully at her
mother, saying: "Ah, yes; might there not have been some mistake
made by the old scientists in deciphering the records? Do
<i>you</i> really believe we have ascended from such frightful
beings?"</p>

<p>Looking very steadfastly at her niece, now at her daughter, she
replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly, my sceptics. No one <i>now</i> doubts evolution. A
few thousands of years ago, there yet remained some whose egotism
would not allow them even to examine the knowledge. But, in our
age, intelligence shines unclouded by that dense ignorance which
deferred progress for so great a length of time. In the present,
only some unthinking children rebel against the reception of all
these grand truths&mdash;the accumulation of discoveries, the
outcome of brainwork which has continued more than two millions of
years. When it is considered how small are the reason, thought and
consequent judgment of young minds it is not surprising. I often
think we older heads are much too exacting in expecting our dear
young students to receive instruction patiently as we impart
it."</p>

<p>The girls whose expression had been gradually changing to one of
affectionate attention, are about to speak when she
continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, my birdies, you shall not excuse yourselves for being
truthful. You must always give me your opinions, that I may know
what knowledge you have attained, and what remains for me to
do&mdash;though it would conduce more quickly to your improvement
if you sometimes reflected before giving them. While entreating you
to <i>think</i>, I forget not the immense difficulties so placed
before you. I know your powers are yet feeble; but habit
strengthens. Never forget the old maxim, 'Think or Sink.'"</p>

<p class="poem">'Certain 'tis, one of those two<br>
All human kind must do.'</p>

<p>"Now is spring. By close of autumn we shall have run through all
the ages of which we have record. Then we will <i>ascend</i> this
marvellous ladder of life, and study each step more closely. By the
time we reach our own brightly happy era, both my dear student will
acknowledge that there is no degradation, but an indisputable
wisdom, in evolution; giving loving confidence in the Infinite, and
an elevating assurance of still greater advancement in future
ages&mdash;towards which we work when we <i>think honestly</i> and
<i>act conscientiously</i>. You are inclined to believe the poor
creatures in that case not human models, because their forms are
unlike our own. This will teach you how balefully lasting is the
effect of ignorance. They purposely distorted their bodies from
laudable desire to become graceful and beautiful. (The girls glance
scornfully at the nineteenth century fashionables.) It was then the
custom all over the earth to try and beautify nature by deformity.
To effect this, some slit their lips, others elongated the head by
pressure, seamed the skin, injured the nose, hung jewels in it,
crippled the feet, and much besides! The most civilized changed the
natural appearance of the human body by pressing the ribs into the
interior, altered the shape of their feet, painted in red and
black; and, by attaching metal weights to them, lengthened their
ears, as if in deference to some of their four-legged relatives.
All this seems highly reprehensible to you, as I read by that
unwelcome glance of scorn. Now ask yourselves what would be your
own beauty, or that of your children's, if scorn should become a
feeling in you&mdash;and for whom? For the early beings of our
species, who, in crudeness of thought bore all that enervating
suffering in daily performance of what they had been taught was
their duty! Think, and you will see all these past errors arose
from an intuition of a higher state of beauty, and they only acted
in accordance with their small understandings. They had not learnt
that mind&mdash;the mind increasing from era to era&mdash;alone can
bring the really beautiful. They had little but ignorant vanity to
guide them. The unfortunate result of which is this day to raise a
falsely happy hope in my dear students that all the wonderful truth
we are studying should prove to be a mistake!&mdash;Accompany me to
the torture department, I will there show you the wretched
implement with which those poor women so caricatured the human
form."</p>

<p>They move towards another alcove at the extreme end of the
gallery. Most womanly women are these! I know not which most to
admire&mdash;the wisdom, tenderness and benevolence of the
instructress, the earnest love and respect of Consuelo, or the
resolute, fearless, truth-seeking, affectionate deference of Syra.
A noble mind, grandly expressed in her dazzling countenance, has
this girl. Though so immature now, she will rule herself and mount
in knowledge until she become one of the foremost philosophers of
her century. Her words will show many hitherto hidden truths with
lightning clearness, and so she will add much new knowledge to the
old.</p>

<p>In that coming time, you and I, reader, will recognize Syra
Kaido:&mdash;and, amidst curiously fading memories, will perhaps
wonder where we first heard the name.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>WE are in the torture department. I shall not describe its
sickening details. It contains all the vile instruments devised by
Christians for producing physical agony&mdash;considered by our
ancestors so very essential in their conversion of persons to faith
in the unreasonable. While reflecting upon the indisputable fact
that hundreds of thousands so suffered rather than profess to
believe what they could not&mdash;or belie their reason&mdash;my
heart leaps at thought of their courageous truth! and a feeling of
happy pride rushes into my mind, knowing that in Australasia human
beings have never suffered such cruel tests by civilized laws, in
the name of the Infinite!&mdash;Also at knowing that we are
entering a region of thought that will bring benevolence into our
minds. The real religion&mdash;a religion not needing dungeons and
red-hot pincers, but born of reason and <i>re</i><i>al</i>
reverence for the Great Mind&mdash;having sincerity for basis, with
bright hope in the future for everyone.</p>

<p>Creeds built on unreason, savagery and hypocrisy can nowhere
stand. They must away into the black past, with other outcomes of
our tiger blood! Ponder well, oh mythmen all. The sooner you bow to
truth, the sooner will you know a nobility of happiness at present
so unknown to you.</p>

<p>We stop before a case labelled "Appliances for voluntary
torture, used chiefly by women. Some families of notably small
minds continued the practices even to the end of the twentieth
century, when they were finally abolished&mdash;some in consequence
of growing intelligence, and some by Parliamentary measures."</p>

<p>Among many articles, the use of which is unknown to my memory,
are rings for ears, nose jewels, boots, and stays. By their side a
fossil skeleton, with its ribs cruelly bent and displaced.</p>

<p>The elder lady turns to her niece, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, Syra, are the barbaric implements used by our
progenitresses in their ignorance of physiology and crude notions
of beauty. Doubtless you will think your pretty apology for hasty
expression of erroneous judgment was scarcely due when I tell you
the first examination of these bones misled all the naturalists of
the day; for, after many meetings and learned discussions, it was
concluded that they must have belonged to an extinct variety of
ape, until one doctress Verax, in her travels, met with more of
those fossil bones, and at last, after several years' careful study
and research, satisfactorily proved them human, and the new shape
to have been caused by some barbaric distortionary process, all of
which was subsequently verified by our valuable records. An
authority, for what I endeavour to impart to my dear girls, so
incontrovertible that I cannot help feeling a little surprise at
their doubts."</p>

<p>To which Syra answers, in a gentle but determined voice:</p>

<p>"I was very wrong, dear aunt, to have uttered any word which
might have sounded like doubt in your extensive knowledge, and the
more so that I thereby led Consuelo into the same shallow judgment.
It is all too clearly true (looking sadly at the models before
her). Pierced their flesh to hang therein toys of ornamented metal
or stones! Human kind must, indeed, have been low! Deformed the
beautifully designed body in ignorant vanity that they could
improve it! And these were human beings! Ah, yes, it is too
true&mdash;and being so (her magnificent eyes flash blindingly), I
think every one of these most degrading records of our origin
should be utterly destroyed, and all means taken to lose memory of
them. When I take my seat in the senate I will frame and introduce
a measure for the accomplishment of so desirable a termination. And
I . . ."</p>

<p>"Not yet, my sweet rebel," says a deep musical voice.</p>

<p>Two noble-looking gentlemen had entered behind the girls' seats,
and listened amusedly to the impassioned words Syra had uttered
very grandly. Her expression changes to one of bright glad welcome
as she rises to greet her father who continues, with the kindest
look I have yet seen in man's eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not yet, Syra. When youth can learn this marvellous plan of
human progression, with minds and hearts of obedient resolve, it
might be time to efface much that is so sickening in detail. But
while students receive such instruction with rebellious feeling,
and eyes ablaze with the nation of vanity at hearing they have
sprung from these poor ancestors, they are living proofs that the
time has, unfortunately, not yet arrived. Nay, say nothing now. Do
you not hear mid-day song? Think upon all you have heard and said
this morning during your reflection hour, and give me wiser results
tomorrow for I shall then be able to take your aunt's place in
gallery lectures."</p>

<p>While he had been speaking the other gentleman had entered into
conversation with the instructress. As their eyes met, I read
marriage in the utmost loveliness and purity. Their every glance
shows the great fidelity and lasting affection which can spring
only from the mutual respect of one equal for another in that
life-long bond. No base concealments in either. No
more-than-half-mock deference on one side, received hypocritically
with ill-disguised disgust on the other&mdash;too often to be seen
in the so-called unions of my era. How different is the real union
of these very dear friends and companions! Of all enchanting
experiences in this far-away age, I have met none more beautiful,
more elevating, or so fully expressive of true happiness as the
loving and most honorable bond everywhere existing between married
persons. Such can never exist between master and slave; neither can
it ever grow between self-styled superiors and those they have been
taught to consider their inferiors. There never was, and never can
be, so high a union while law places one above the other, whether
that one be so in reality or not. There are very few marriages
where ability is equally balanced&mdash;in some the woman's is
greater, in some the man's. This natural supremacy, if justice
reigned, would adjust itself without heartburnings to any; but so
long as law makes one sex dominant&mdash;<i>by virtue of sex
only</i>&mdash;and to that one gives all honors, and opens every
avenue to distinction, to the exclusion of the grandest
intellect&mdash;if the owner be not of that sex&mdash;there can
reign nothing but disaster everywhere. For the offspring of
marriage under such iniquitous laws can only be so much increase to
the injustice, deceit, oppression, and all degrading wrongs which
have polluted, and still pollute, communities, high and low, past
and present, throughout the whole world. For noble happiness to
exist between wife and husband, there must be perfect equality of
world power. Their interests are the same&mdash;the advancement of
their species&mdash;and one can no more accomplish that without the
other than perpetuate it without the other. The time must come when
women shall unite with men in the construction of laws which affect
every human being. For educated women are producing talented and
conscientious men. Every one such man is an assurance of future
justice, and consequent progress in the world. Neither sex could
quite define what enactments are necessary for the other. There is
but one righteous method for arriving at what is wisest and
just&mdash;namely, their <i>combined judgement on their united
interests</i>. Every other can only result in failure, as is daily
to be seen.</p>

<p>Some there are who say: "If we permit woman to go <i>beyond her
sphere</i> (?), domestic duties will be neglected." In plainer
language, "If we acknowledge woman is human, we shall not get so
much work out of her."</p>

<p>I wonder the most foolish, even of male fools, are not sick and
ashamed of uttering such silly, shallow objections. To hear those
men discuss the question one would imagine if women had the
franchise they would of necessity be voting from morning until
night every day of their lives, to the complete neglect of
everything conducive to man's comfort. Do merchants or professional
men neglect business because they are allowed power to vote? Do
mechanics or labourers neglect their work because they have the
right to record their opinion upon the merits or demerits of
candidates for legislation? If voting or reflecting upon whom to
vote for interfered with duties, then by their own ruling it would
be <i>far more likely to do so with men</i>&mdash;because they
assert that their occupations require more thought than those of
women. Now most of woman's work, at present, only requires pretty
strong muscles and patience. She has, therefore, more time for
thinking about the world's economy than have men; and she
<i>does</i> think often more deeply than men, who, with their
grosser comprehension, failing to understand hers are perfectly
satisfied in calling her "stupid."</p>

<p>I can assure these objectors to progress that when woman no
longer has occasion to fret under disabilities, which are hers in
common with criminals and lunatics, her tasks will be far more
cheerfully performed. Her long hours of toilsome drudgery will be
brightened by the feeling that she is more than a broom or
incubator; equally with men a power in the State&mdash;no longer to
be treated as a born inferior by every male imp over twelve years
of age. She will reflect upon the various qualifications of the
candidates, with her great powers of observation and deduction. She
will remember who may have proved themselves deficient in truth and
ability, and she will record her vote against such
candidates&mdash;for woman performs all her work
conscientiously&mdash;and will not fail when raised to a dignified
position. Faculties, which in many are now little more than latent
in her, as in the larger number of men, will rapidly develop to the
progression of all human kind.</p>

<p>Others say, voting will render woman <i>unwomanly</i>. What
unreasonable talk! I tell such men <i>they</i> make women
"unwomanly" when they put more children in their houses than can be
wholesomely or nobly reared. <i>That</i> most perniciously to all
concerned renders woman unwomanly, and injures her in every way as
mother and citizen. But a woman will never become unwomanly through
exerting her intellect in erecting institutions or fashioning laws,
which are to either save or ruin her children. And this is, in
honest fact what franchise means to our sex&mdash;nothing other
than increasing our power and thought for the future welfare of our
dear ones.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>THEY have gone, and I now fly with my new power of speed to join
the glorious throngs flocking from all parts of the building on
their homeward way.</p>

<p>What a scene and sound of mirth and gladness! Surely these happy
beings have no sorrow greater than that occasioned by looking into
the doings of their progenitors. No corroding, cowardly fear of
death born of vicious doctrines. Both sexes, and all ages, are
elastic with health of body and healthy hopes.</p>

<p>Some are earnestly discussing; some joyously greeting friends as
they meet in the enormous hall, forming the junction of the many
galleries; others brimming with fun over a recital of experiences
or suggestions. Yet, notwithstanding this mixture of multitudinous
sounds there is nothing jarring to the ear, or in any way
offensive. It is a bright, perfect moving picture! The greater
number, old and young, are singing "mid-day song." I have caught a
stanza:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Another morn<br>
From us has flown,<br>
But thought is born<br>
And knowledge sown!</p>

<p>Here is another advancing&mdash;so sweetly!&mdash;from one of
the other galleries:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Facts evolving,<br>
Darkness fleeing,<br>
Mists dissolving,<br>
Great truths seeing.</p>

<p>Every ear is so well in tune, by nature and correct tuition,
that no false notes are uttered. Now and again some of the talkers
join in for a verse or two, and this occasions a magical crescendo,
gradually diminishing as the foremost ones leave the hall. Talking,
laughing and singing form one great harmonious music, making quite
a new excitation to my spirit&mdash;only partly to be imagined by
hearing one of Wagner's illustrious marches, faithfully performed
by thousands of Albonis, Grisis, Marios and such singers.</p>

<p>Could Wagner also have had a vision of this happy future age,
and heard its music? I think so. Then little cause for wonder is
there that his orchestras could not quite render the splendid
harmony he alone had heard.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>SOME will expect me to describe the clothing worn by these
enchanting human beings. I am so very ignorant of dress language
that I fear being unable to make my impressions understood by such
seekers for information. They may be certain that wisdom is not
wrapped in <i>swaddling clothes</i>. Here is far more uniformity of
make than in my era; yet&mdash;and many will think this strangely
inexplicable&mdash;the individuality of each person is far more
apparent than is to be found in my era, where absurdities are so
closely followed that it is difficult to tell one ninny from
another. I find the explanation of this great difference in the
simple fact that these beautifully graceful beings are
<i>natural</i>.</p>

<p>The women wear rather loose, prettily but not
<i>over</i>ornamented, trousers. Tunic; sometimes made in one
garment from the shoulders. Others have it from waist only, and
short jacket fitting freely. No superfluous folds or trimming.
Nothing tightened&mdash;not a skewer anywhere!</p>

<p>Tunic worn longer by the elderly.</p>

<p>Material is as perfect as is all else here, but I know not of
what it is composed&mdash;a discovery we have yet to make. Rich and
soft beyond any fabric I have seen! Colours are everywhere
harmoniously blended, and suiting complexions of the wearers.
Anything more picturesque in groups of humanity than these now
delighting my wondering eyes cannot be imagined.</p>

<p>Their feet are encased in some very yielding material&mdash;not
leather; nowhere is any to be found. It is perfectly protecting,
yet allows plainly to be observed all those pretty little movements
of an untrammelled step. This adds a great charm to the whole body,
enabling it to take any position firmly and naturally.</p>

<p>When I think of my unfortunate contemporaries, hobbling along in
the imprisoning, unyielding, high-heeled boot of the period, the
memory is most hideous and lamentable.</p>

<p>The men and boys dress somewhat in the now ridiculed aesthetic
style&mdash;which is a graceful, becoming, handsome and
<i>modest</i> one.</p>

<p>Neither women nor men wear any black.</p>

<p>Though all clothe simply as to form, I could never have imagined
anything so perfect in dress as the effects caused by this wondrous
fabric of which these clothes are made.</p>

<p>Hair is short (not <i>shaved</i>) on every head&mdash;for in
their age all is cleanliness. Hats or caps, varying in form
according to fancy of wearer, easily removed, and always
becoming.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>HERE is a very animated group! Amongst them are those with whom
I passed my morning. No trace of the gloom their most unpleasant
studies had caused them to feel so sadly. Bright glances and joyous
sounds from all!</p>

<p>How changed are the two rebels, Syra Kaido and Frederick! If
marriage were not forbidden to them for the next five or six years,
I should think they would soon be "comrades." I am not sure if I
have before told that wife and husband are here so designated; the
old terms signifying master and servant having been abandoned ages
ago.</p>

<p>There is my beautiful Veritée, laughing merrily at something her
father has just said to her and her mother.</p>

<p>Now they all join the song and turn to leave. I will not again
lose them.</p>

<p>Wottah runs after us with more of his nonsense&mdash;sung this
time&mdash;and creates fresh hilarity between the young people.</p>

<p>We have descended the steps and I now see many entrances of the
same size as the one by which I stood in the early morning.</p>

<p>We settle ourselves in a handsome, comfortably constructed
carriage. Veritée moves a small handle&mdash;we rise, over the
throngs of people, clear of the buildings, and away we go. Oh, the
pleasurable feeling! Nothing has ever equalled it, save in dream
travels. Mid-day song floating after us&mdash;very faintly now,
more like <i>whispered</i> music. And the glorious scene! or more
correctly panoramas&mdash;as we fly over the pretty houses,
surrounded by flourishing gardens;&mdash;for here are no buildings
crowded together, breeding disease in its many cruel shapes. Every
dwelling has around it a certain quantity of land, in which are
growths of use and decoration. No sign of poverty in homes or
people. Green restful valleys, aspiring hills, and on one side
magnificent mountains, with their marvellous clefts, varying
heights, and many shades of beautiful tints. The whole is just what
one would love to look at and think about for ever.</p>

<p>We have come a great distance, and are now descending. We alight
in a paved enclosure; evidently the resting-place for our carriage,
for there is one part roofed to protect it from rain.</p>

<p>House stands on columns a few feet high. A flight of steps, so
perfectly constructed that no one feels any exertion in mounting
them, leads to a lobby, from which we pass into a corridor running
the whole length of the house&mdash;which is prettily curved, as
are all buildings, more or less; some being quite circular. At a
glance I think its length is about 80 feet, and 20 feet in width.
In the outer wall are large, high bay-windows, reaching nearly to
the floor, stained to cause a pleasant soft light, yet not
excluding view of the landscape. So they look much like magnificent
pictures hung against the wall&mdash;for the glass of windows is in
one piece. Between them are statues in niches, and ornamented
supports, holding books and music. The roof is slightly
arched&mdash;I know the acoustic qualities are faultless. In the
inner wall are handsome glass doors, opening into suites of
rooms.</p>

<p>Here my darlings separate for bath and "reflection hour."</p>

<p>It must be one o'clock. No one has yet complained of hunger or
talked of food&mdash;I wonder if these people ever eat!</p>

<p>While the young students are on their way to their respective
apartments, the parents exchange a look of affectionate pride. Oh,
that I were an artist! I would give my century some delighting
pictures from this distant age!</p>

<p>These tender parents and <i>true friends</i>, how fascinating
they are! Their brave, reliable, loving eyes speaking perfect ease
of spirit and mind of noble endeavour. They are lovely as they step
into the soft light from each window during their promenade to and
fro, discussing earnestly a matter beyond my understanding.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>BEFORE the door of Verite's room lies a handsome animal. It
somewhat resembles a Newfoundland dog, with a tiger's skin, but
eyes of dutiful love. Why is this? It growls at my approach, as it
doubtless would were I dressed in my earth body, and a troubled
look is in its face!</p>

<p>The door opens. I enter her room while Veritée caresses the
animal, saying: "Not your time yet, Leoni. You are impatient this
afternoon. Lie quietly, you unreasonable old dear."</p>

<p>We are in Veritée's study&mdash;a pretty room, shelves full of
books, small table (by which is a full-length statue holding a
torch) and two comfortable chairs. We pass through a bathroom into
the sleep chamber;&mdash;bed without hangings or other
disease-creating rubbish about it, yet it is far prettier than
those we have in use. By the head is the light-giving statue, which
is, at the same time, refinement and utility. In file further side
is large glass door, opening to a verandah or balcony, having steps
along its whole length which is that of the house, leading into a
garden&mdash;so pleasant with its new and varied growths that it
almost made me forget Veritée.</p>

<p>She has taken off her outer clothes, and on the only chair is
laying those wondrous garments&mdash;impossible to crush, yet so
lustrous. Her under dress is a duplicate suit of silk, more closely
fitting. Now she goes through various bodily exercises. How
graceful is her every action!</p>

<p>Calisthenics over, she goes into the bath-room, admits water,
and, with some contrivance unknown to me, makes it of requisite
temperature.</p>

<p>Removing her silken covering, she plunges into the bath. Oh,
stays wearers! high-heeled, tight boots wearers! that you could see
the exquisite formation of this girl's body! The finest statuary
you have ever seen would be clumsy by comparison with her. Even the
beautifully shaped Chloé, after my Veritée, sinks to a pert-looking
disproportioned human animal&mdash;and your own shape grotesquely
offensive! I feel really the "half brute" these people think us,
compared with her. It seems a profanation for one of my gross era
to even look at her.</p>

<p>Leo growls.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>BATH and dressing have not occupied more than ten
minutes&mdash;yet here she is, fit to join the most resplendent
company that ever was.</p>

<p>Again Leo growls.</p>

<p>This time Vefitée admits him. In passing me he mutters
discontentedly&mdash;strange coincidence, if it is one! or can
animals know more than humankind? Can Leoni know there is in this
pure life a remnant&mdash;or visitor, or whatever my presence here
may mean&mdash;from the ignorant ages?</p>

<p>The girl walks to and fro, reflecting&mdash;the dog or tiger,
whichever it is, following her closely.</p>

<p>Now she seats herself, Leo stands before her and looks wistfully
in her eyes, as if he would dearly love to communicate something.
She takes his massive head between her hands, and looking
affectionately at him, says:</p>

<p>"Now, Leoni, kind old tiger, you are not acting quite honorably
to-day. You know I allowed you to enter earlier on condition that
you would lie quietly and not disturb my thoughts." Here the
faithful beast looks appealingly at her, as if to reply: "Dear
mistress mine, how I burn to tell you of danger near." Then,
feeling how impossible it is, he lays his enormous paw upon her
knee&mdash;which looks as if it might break her delicate
leg&mdash;turns towards me and utters a menacing growl.</p>

<p>"Leoni you are certainly inexplicable."</p>

<p>Removing his paw from her knee, she has an expression like that
I saw on her mother's face in the gallery. Has the animal directed
her thought?</p>

<p>"Leoni, my friend, I have been thinking that both you and I had
decidedly objectionable ancestor; but (caressing him) they are not
here to prevent us from doing our duty in this better life. Go you,
dear fellow and lie down while I think about our wretched past. If
you disturb me again, I must dismiss you."</p>

<p>The last words were said so decisively that the tiger instantly
obeyed, his furry face expressing love and sadness as plainly as I
have seen them in human countenance.</p>

<p>Veritée again walks her room&mdash;a perfect young beauty in her
meditation! I feel it would be a very long time before I should
grow weary of the picture now before me. Soft landscape, seen
through the glass door. Tiger lying in attitude of repose, with
eyes so devotedly watchful! The light statue. Total absence of
tawdry, senseless ornaments, the only decoration being fine
painting on the walls. A very pleasant light from above; and this
graceful, beautiful, highminded girl thinking deeply while she
walks to and from me.</p>

<p>Having walked during fully half an hour, she seats herself at
the table and writes in a large book, on the cover of which is
"Thoughts."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>A SMALL bell sounds near her chair. She rises instantly, and
even while she goes towards the door her look of deep study has
passed away.</p>

<p>Frederick joins her in the corridor. A romp with the great kind
tiger gives some picturesque grouping. Except the impress on
features of thought that has been, and can again be, all expression
of reflection has gone from their faces as the young people gambol
along, laughing gaily at "Leo's unusual delight at leaving
school."</p>

<p>We enter a large room, in which are their parents. Must I
describe it? It seems to my mind anyone might imagine such an
apartment in such an age of reason.</p>

<p>Bereft of all old curiosity lumber&mdash;which I firmly believe
is only a device for causing work&mdash;it is sensibly and
elegantly a room where one can walk or rest in comfort.
Lightstatues, of course; painted walls, I mean subject-painting;
two tables; and a few very resting chairs of pretty workmanship. At
the opposite end to the one by which we entered are three wide
glass doors, opening on to the verandah. Thence looking over the
garden, is a view more beautiful than any other I have seen.</p>

<p>In centre of the room is a pillar, having looking-glass all
round without a visible line to mar the effect, which is exquisite,
especially where it reflects that marvellous scenery so wondrously
enchanting. Yet I have only power to describe it as hills, near and
far, bewilderingly shaded. The numerous tints, some quite new to my
eyes caused by the bright flowers here and there abounding. Afar is
a cascade, the shining water from which is to be traced at various
angles among the valleys until it terminates in a lake to the
right, bordered by magnificent trees. Near that are dwellings,
pleasant pictures in themselves. Everywhere the freshness and the
hope of spring!</p>

<p>But these poor words can give only a very imperfect idea of the
splendors, and the grandeur of the scene on which I gaze.</p>

<p>With feelings of deepest reverence I wonder&mdash;and for the
thousandth time, at least, sigh for a life of such beauty and
purity!</p>

<p>A concerted laugh arouses me. On turning I find Leo staring
apparently into my face and muttering.</p>

<p>"What does he see?" says Frederick. Then his sister tells him of
his conduct in her room, which is generally considered as something
remarkable.</p>

<p>During my absorption at the window they have prepared a dinner,
or whatever it is named&mdash;five or six absurdly small loaves,
three different kinds of fruit that has evidently been stored from
summer (all new sorts) and a vessel of water. Not much after so
long a fast! yet I learn they will take no more until to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>As with the young people, so it is with their parents&mdash;all
look, words and tone of study gone. They enter into the humor of
their children, and every one of the happy assemblage seems
young.</p>

<p>Afternoon pastime is under discussion. Veritée wishes to
accompany her mother and father to senate, to hear the debates.</p>

<p>Frederick is anxious to go to Waratah (100 miles away), that he
might have an hour in the museum. At last it is decided that, the
day being exceptionally fine, they should "fly over to the West
coast," and "have a run on the beach."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>THIS is delightful! High in the air, flying along at the rate of
about 80 miles an hour.</p>

<p>After having left their parents at the Senate Palace, the
children and I are fairly on our journey. Frederick guides, while
Veritée has charge of the repellor, which is the really onerous
care&mdash;for a mistake with steerer would only change their
course; but neglect of the repellor might result in loss of life,
and life is sacred in this age.</p>

<p>Onward we go! The exciting swiftness arouses very strange
sensations. For some minutes I could notice nothing
distinctly&mdash;our present speed is so much greater than that on
return from gallery lecture. All is so new and wonderrousing to a
most bewildering degree. Hills, valleys, plains, lakes, all things
appear to be rushing madly towards us, while we await their
coming.</p>

<p>Now a mountain passes under us, within a few feet of our
vehicle, chilling us with its snow and glaciers. Now a tumbled mass
of hills, rocks and streams fly along far below us&mdash;an awful
depth! Wonders and grandeurs everywhere!</p>

<p>Strangely and sweetly contrasting with this furious race of
inanimate objects there comes a sound, which I think would be
powerful to save even a breaking reason&mdash;simply a song from
the occupants of an advancing car. Who has never heard this
entrancing music cannot imagine it. It absorbs all thought. One
feels it is everything! and one wishes for nothing else. When the
last notes have faded away, the mind has calmed, and the rushing
world seems more orderly in its progress. After more than an hour
of this travelling we slacken speed. Beneath us pass along enormous
boulders, rocks, precipices and high cliffs. A broad white beach,
miles in length, rises to us and gently receives our carriage.</p>

<p>A few other carriages are here also. My darlings alight, and
joyfully meet some young friends, among whom are their cousins,
Carl and Justina, who, I hear, are coming to practise glees this
evening.</p>

<p>They all roam gaily about the beach. Some have brought
bathing-dresses&mdash;and merry parties of maidens and youths are
dancing in the bright sea.</p>

<p>Here are some extraordinarily beautiful rock
formations&mdash;nature's sculpture! grandest of all!</p>

<p>But I shall remain in the carriage, and reflect over what has
already been taught me.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>

<p class="poem">Good night, good night,<br>
The hour is nine;<br>
With morn more light<br>
Be yours and mine.</p>

<p>THESE words, sung by sweet voices, arouse me. Nearer they come.
Veritée and Frederick are dismissing their visitors.</p>

<p>They returned from the beach, and have passed happy hours in
song and dance, while I have been&mdash;where?</p>

<p>I enter the house with them.</p>

<p>They are separating for night-rest, when Veritée exclaims:</p>

<p>"Look at Leo! One would imagine he sees what we cannot&mdash;and
something not pleasing to see."</p>

<p>Leoni is certainly gazing into my eyes with an expression of
contempt and dread. Are we, then, in some respects deserving the
contumely even of beasts? Does the animal really see me? What can
it mean?</p>

<p>Is this, after all, no distant age? or is it the future of a
higher world, into whose seas portions of our disrupted earth shall
fall! Then, no wonder these young people find their lesson so
distasteful.</p>

<p>What are worlds? ages? life? death?&mdash;Death! That word ought
not to be. <i>There can be no death.</i> Light comes; but, oh, how
dazzling! It is too bewildering for my imperfect mind.</p>

<p>My thoughts are flying in the whirling manner some of those
hills and ravines we so lately passed over. Infinite powers!
Whatever&mdash;&mdash;Oh, vain atom!</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>YESTERDAY'S flight was too much for me; but a bright fresh
morning has brought restoration of my tired faculties.</p>

<p>Breakfast&mdash;vegetables and bread&mdash;just finished. A
servant clears the table. She opens a door in the glass pillar, and
by a flight of stairs follows the tray, which is being raised to an
upper room used for the performance of what little culinary work
there is to be done.</p>

<p>This woman, a complete lady in all her movements, will work
until twelve o'clock, then leave, having the remainder of the day
for recreation or instruction. She has the same expression of noble
integrity that all people here have. Refined and graceful as her
employer.</p>

<p>Again in the air carriage with all the family. This motion
appears very little after yesterday's, and being nearer the ground
there is no longer that half-maddening illusion which so disturbed
my power of thought. Besides, <i>the human mind soon becomes
accu</i><i>stomed to what was at first a startling novelty to its
unused strength.</i> Veritée cleverly steers the carriage through a
wide opening, into the highest room of a large factory.</p>

<p>Her father alights. Carl steps into his uncle's place, amidst
mingled adieus and greetings and we start for the instruction
galleries.</p>

<p>Carl is about twenty-six. He has a grandly good countenance,
evidencing thought of high tendency.</p>

<p>I learn he accompanies us to take the carriage back, that his
uncle may join us "after work."</p>

<p>I hear some say, "work!" Yes, my fine pretentious fools of the
nineteenth century, that noble man&mdash;gentleman in his every
thought, word and act&mdash;is a <i>mechanic</i>; his "comrade" far
excelling the "greatest lady" among you.</p>

<p><i>Education, bringing its refinement into the mind as surely to
be reflected in speech and actions,</i> is <i>the true</i> and
<i>certain leveller.</i></p>

<p>Intellect and benevolence are the coming aristocrats, before
whom you shams must disappear. You, who have extra words before
your names because some of your ancestors were more brutal or more
subtle in <i>legalised murder</i>, for that, and naught higher, is
the horrid remnant of savage customs called <i>war</i>. As reward
for unusual ferocity in helping their chiefs to rob some, who were
numerically weaker, of their homes, your ancestors were apportioned
slices of such robberies&mdash;politely termed
<i>annexations</i>&mdash;to which was added the privilege of
placing an additional word or words before their names. Then
compelled the rightful owners of such lands to slave for them, by
which means they acquired wealth as contemptibly as they did lands
and titles. Because you were born to a name having those extra
words attached, you consider your so-called <i>noble</i> selves too
exquisite to associate with others who are really often far above
you. You think you confer a favor in receiving, as your guest, a
person of scientific or literary acquirements, if such person have
only a few <i>letters</i> after her or his name. The time is
steadily advancing when <i>those letters will be the only titles
the world will respect</i>.</p>

<p>To none others would I bow; and this not, as some little minds
may imagine, from paltry envy, for one of those contemptible
blood-stained titles is in my own family.</p>

<p>Should a son of mine succeed to it, I would implore him not to
<i>disgrace</i> his name by adding sham honors thereto.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>WE have arrived. Again I am in the court-yard of this palace of
learning. Together we mount the steps. As we proceed towards an
alcove, more of earnestness comes in all their
faces&mdash;noticeable in every group taking places for study.</p>

<p>My darlings all have removed hats, and are seated.</p>

<p>At his mother's request, Frederick reads from book of
reference:</p>

<p>"These strange-looking implements were used by those half-brutal
people to destroy life, when they coveted the possessions of other
communities, or to avenge any insult to their vanity. So merciless
were they that, not content with annihilating their own kind in
their frightful encounters, they also killed vast numbers of an
elegant animal called the horse. Many writers of the twenty-first
century affirm that its intelligence often exceeded that of its
owner. For further information see the interesting work entitled
'Where is the Horse?' by Z. Darrin, said to have ascended from an
ancient writer named Darwin, who, with a few others of his time,
met with great opposition and vituperation, because they used their
reason more than was customary in those ages."</p>

<p>"Of course," says the mother, "no writers of that early time
could have reached the present stage of knowledge, and they were
consequently at fault in many of their deductions. But that was not
the cause of the foolish gibes with which unthinkers assailed them.
It was the <i>atom of truth</i> they had surely discovered, which
was so offensive to the ignorance and prejudice of their
contemporaries. (Turning to the cases facing their alcove.) Now
examine those representations&mdash;you will there see how little
removed from brutes were the men of that fierce age."</p>

<p>In one half of first case are correct models of an arsenal and
"munition of war." The other half shows two opposing armies
preparing for attack.</p>

<p>The second case well demonstrates the small value of life in our
times. Heaps of horses and men dead or dying! The "Conquering
Heroes" (so they are labelled) are cruelly illusing every living
being, even women and children.</p>

<p>Another represents the two "Crowned Heads," who had directed all
these horrors, <i>shaking hands</i>. "The one whose murderous
implements had destroyed the most, having thus compelled the other
to call a piece of land by another name; all people living upon it
to be subject to the conqueror&mdash;henceforth to act and feign to
think according to his mighty will. Such terrible injustice was
frequently perpetrated when one chief or monarch uttered some
puerile insult concerning another&mdash;or, more often, when he
coveted some country not ruled over by him."</p>

<p>I extract the foregoing from book of reference.</p>

<p>As the students examine those horrors and savage pomp, their
feelings become too excited for utterance. After observing them
during a few minutes, their mother says:</p>

<p>"Yes, my darlings truly a most shocking and pitiable
sight&mdash;yet those atrocities, and others even exceeding them,
were frequently committed under the cloak of religion. So great
were their vanity and ignorance of noble ideas that they made loud
boasts of their 'victories'&mdash;so those murders were
called&mdash;and myth-men in their churches thanked their God for
them. Tender innocent children were constantly undergoing
scourgings and other barbarous punishments in their schools, for
being unable to remember lessons containing names of those
slaughters and the principal slaughterers."</p>

<p>I can attest the truth of this! When between six and seven years
of age I have been kept standing on a form until my delicate limbs
ached, and had frequently to undergo similar torture&mdash;to say
nothing of sundry cuffings and other assaults&mdash;because my
young mind refused to be saturated with knowledge of those bloody
deeds. Rote lessons on unnecessary subjects have done, and are
doing, immense harm to the young.</p>

<p>Her eyes wear the expression of looking back through intervening
ages. Mournful, and so beautiful, in her largeminded pity!
nobility&mdash;<i>real</i> nobility&mdash;stamped on every feature.
Reflectively she continues:</p>

<p>"There are some, besides students, who think the deeds of those
ignorant times ought to be consigned to oblivion&mdash;others are
of opinion that human nature has not yet sufficiently advanced to
lose memory of such deterrent examples. Indeed, it is scarcely 2000
years since a man was convicted of endeavouring to borrow money,
and several teachers punished for striking their pupils. I fear it
will be long ere our blood be quite safe from reversion; in which
case we should have to re-commence all. Such deterioration occurred
frequently within human knowledge in the early ages. Several times
intelligence struggled as far as it attained in the twentieth
century of the Age of Blood&mdash;when as often, the dreadful tiger
taint threw all back again."</p>

<p>Frederick interrupts her, and there is real astonishment in his
voice as he asks: "Were tigers ever so cruel as <i>this?</i>
(Pointing to the 'Conquering Heroes.') If so, our kind pet, Leoni,
cannot be of the same species."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, it has been as conclusively proved that the congener
of our sweet-tempered, gentle animal was the mean ferocious tiger
of that age as that these fierce murderloving men were the
progenitors of our noble-minded Fredericks and Carls of the present
day. You must take into your analysis of our history that in those
sadly <i>ignorant</i> old times, men, and many other vindictive
animals, <i>devoured flesh</i>. It is easy to understand bow such a
primeval diet would tend to the conservation of blood-thirsty
instincts, more especially if eaten uncooked, as by the tigers
then. Indeed, in some countries there existed brutes in somewhat of
human form, who ate anything that had lived&mdash;cooked or
not&mdash;even their own species."</p>

<p>Frederick:</p>

<p>"Oh, horrible! (Looking at the cases.) Yet it was not much worse
than the <i>amusements</i> of the 'Conquering Heroes.' What could
be more contemptibly ferocious than that one who has just divided
an infant with his cruel blade."</p>

<p>Very sorrowfully his mother replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>even worse than that</i> was done by those heroes. So
much more so that it could not be represented here, could not be
<i>told</i> in the present era&mdash;all of which was the result of
a state of ignorance, impossible for us to fully imagine. In these
war records you have seen one great cause of premature death,
cruelty, grief and misery, which endured long, very long, after the
originators had passed away, and their vanity forgotten. But
(rising from her seat) the <i>greatest factor of calamity of every
known sort under which poor ignorant humanity has writhed in
agony&mdash;bodily and mental</i>&mdash;I have yet to inform you
upon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>WE are again behind the cases, on our way to another alcove.</p>

<p>Admiringly I glance at the beautiful groups of parents and their
student children.</p>

<p>We stop before cases labelled "Drink."</p>

<p>Seeing Frederick look amazed, his mother says:</p>

<p>"The word drink had a different signification then to that it
has with us. It was generally understood as a term for various
mixtures of the poison, alcohol and water, swallowed by people to
reduce their mental power until they became&mdash;some like young
children in understanding, some idiotic, some resembled wild beasts
of the most ferocious nature, and others committed acts worse than
any beast was ever known to descend to; according to the
temperament of the imbiber, were produced those direful effects. So
universal was the wish for that deadly poison that the sellers of
it accumulated large fortunes."</p>

<p>He indignantly interrupts her with:</p>

<p>"What a degradation to possess wealth obtained by such ignoble
means!"</p>

<p>"So it was thought, even in their age, by advanced moralists,
But often the dealer in alcoholic drinks passed as a parson devoted
to the Infinite. (Seeing Frekerick's eyes flash.) Try always to
remember the half-barbarous times are reviewing. All young students
make the mistake of judging the past by our advanced natures."</p>

<p>Veritée looks pleadingly at her mother, as if saying: "Some
things are so hard to bear unmoved." And Frederick tells her he
will listen to all she has to say, "even if distressing as that
last information, without again transgressing."</p>

<p>Smiling kindly at them, she desires Frederick to examine the
further case, adding: "And patiently&mdash;remember a progressed
state of thought is always patient with the ignorant."</p>

<p>Not being of this advanced age myself, I cannot help bitterly
contrasting the mechanic's noble "comrade"&mdash;so exalted in
nature, benevolently reviewing the misdeeds of our time&mdash;with
some of our fashionable mothers. How are <i>their</i> mornings
passed? In dressing, reading silly novels, or otherwise ignobly
wasting time in paying and receiving visits. Simply an interchange
of communication, without intellect, love or friendship! where, too
often, the absent are smirched with the polite filth of
scandal-loving tongues, and where the estimable of human kind are
judged by their incomes. The children of such poor fools, where are
they? If very young, their tender lives are in the care of paid
attendants&mdash;<i>strangers</i>. If of school age, the daughters
are undergoing a veneering of education, and the practice of
unnatural attitude&mdash;which is supposed by some to be
particularly expressive of superfine breeding.</p>

<p>The sons are learning to become Solomons and Davids, both by the
quality of their classical studies and their early experience in
male liberty&mdash;that is, the extensive indulgence shown to all
excesses and frivolity&mdash;when committed by their sex.</p>

<p>Thus we cling to the disgraceful "morality" of the past, and
perform our utmost to preserve what of brute remains in us. And, as
if to destroy all antidote, we deny access to libraries and places
of refining influence on Sundays&mdash;the only day the unfortunate
many have to recreate their toil-worn minds or bodies. Then we
lower the corners of our hypocritical mouths and, with true
Pecksniff snuffle, proclaim ourselves "God-fearing people!" Well,
too well, we might "fear," after such misdoing, were the Infinite
one-thousandth part as ferocious as such persons have represented!
For all these young people <i>will</i> have compensation for their
week's drudgery; and <i>where</i> have we driven them to seek it?
Ah, poor human kind! Tiger, bull and goat relationship will long be
discerned in us, under such fatal mistakes as are constantly being
committed by the self-styled wisdom of our ignorant
legislators.</p>

<p>Frederick is still looking at the drunken scenes degrading human
kind. His mother silently reads all that is passing in his humane
reflections. Veritée, to whom those models are not new, is thinking
the growing general opinion&mdash;that all such sights are
unnecessary in their era.</p>

<p>Yet they show not a hundredth of the evils resulting hourly from
use of alcohol as a stimulant! When he sees one representing a man
beating his wife, he returns to his chair saying: "It is sickening.
Did persons really so destroy their minds until, it appears to me,
their conduct was lower than that of apes?"</p>

<p>"Too truly, my son. Alcoholic drink was one of the most
degrading drawbacks of progress that human kind ever suffered from.
It was a disease. It fastened itself in the system; and, while
corroding every organ, forced its miserable victim to repeat and
increase the doses, until dissolution in direst torments ended a
wretched life which might have been happy useful and painless. The
taint was transmitted to our species for thousands of years. When
the child of a drunkard commenced to take such drinks, even in very
small quantities, the dormant tendency to that noxious disease soon
awakened, and became past cure. Alcohol fostered, and even
increased, the strength of brute instincts until men's acts were
truly, as you say below those of beasts. Under its influence the
most revolting of war's horrors were enacted; every sacred feeling
cruelly outraged; and human will was fast becoming only a powerful
force for creating universal unhappiness&mdash;when a brave few,
seeing the state of confusion into which all were drifting, made a
determined stand against its further use. As I have often had
occasion to point out, any <i>combination in the cause of right
must succeed</i>. After many centuries of firm resolve, they
arrested the evil by legislation; for at last, the many who had
objected to what they thought an indignity, had sense enough to
agree to it as the only means for saving the weak-minded, who had
not force of will to save themselves, and the world, from the
baleful effects of their irresolution. Repressive measures were
continued for about forty thousand years. In that time the human
structure gradually changed to a higher form; then intoxication
became impossible, as the introduction of spirits into the system
occasioned instantaneous death or agony great as that caused by
some other poisons, but not to be relieved by any antidote, as its
volatile nature precludes the possibility of extracting it. It flew
at once to the brain, and made the poor sufferer feel as if
his&mdash;I say <i>his</i>, because women left off the habit of
drinking alcohol very many years before men had sufficient sense to
follow their example&mdash;head had suddenly became red-hot metal.
(Turning to her daughter.) I perfectly concur with your
reflections, my Veritée. Our physical nature being unable to
sustain, unharmed, even a drop of this powerful poison it is time
to utterly destroy all these debasing reminders, and eliminate from
our studies this one overwhelming ignorance of the past. In our
physiological lectures you will learn some of its frightful effects
on the bodily organs&mdash;coarse though they were in that crude
stage of human growth. Also, you will then see a model of the last
medical man who prescribed the use of alcohol. The parliament had
him hung by the neck until he was dead."</p>

<p>I think Frederick is about to express approval of that decree,
but Veritée says, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Yes, dear mother, you are always right. I was so reflecting.
Also, whether reversion might not again change our structure to one
of a lower type, and so fit us more for those degrading tastes and
habits; and if that be possible&mdash;pardon nay presuming&mdash;as
to the advisability of so fearful a risk." With much tenderness in
her voice, the mother replies:</p>

<p>"'Pardon' and 'presuming.' My dear one, you know nothing of the
pleasure your words give me. You prove the use made of your
reflection hours. You have philosophically entered upon thought of
deep import. Only yesterday your dear father was discussing that
very view of the subject; but we have not time to-day. Next week it
will be debated in full senate, and you shall be present."</p>

<p>They are informed that the alcove they wish to occupy is now
vacant, and we move towards it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>SEATED, the students look at what is here represented for their
instruction. Frederick reads:</p>

<p>"Coal-mining in the early centuries. Connected with this gloomy
case is one of the brightest of discoveries, and, though made in
that almost savage age, has proved of lasting value to all
civilized communities&mdash;namely, <i>the use of coal as a
fertiliser</i>. A woman in the nineteenth century first reasoned
out the truth, and gave her knowledge to the world as the world's
right. But, as woman's opinions were little understood or prized
when men were in so ignorant a state, her idea was only derided, or
experimented so ignorantly that the proper use of coal was
abandoned until a <i>man</i> discovered it accidentally, about two
hundred years later. When its efficiency had been proved&mdash;to
do which he was furnished with every facility&mdash;the Government
took immediate steps to prevent any further waste by burning of so
precious an aid to agriculture."</p>

<p>He looks up quickly, and in a tone of great astonishment
repeats: "Burning!"</p>

<p>"Yes, previous to that discovery it was only used for heating
and lighting. The gas it contains, which is so necessary to
vegetation, but so destructive to human life, was thus ever
polluting the air and caused much sickness&mdash;the origin of
which was totally unsuspected by the sufferers. When men at last
understood the real value of coal, it was the very help for which
our over-tired earth was languishing; for at that time, humans were
fast abandoning flesh diet for one of pulse, grain and fruit. So
the products of primeval forests were again spread over the soil to
give what was necessary for the perfect growth of a higher
vegetation. This grand provision of nature's I think as wonderful
as beautiful! When the new use of coal became general, it gradually
rid the ground of all the various insects, by whose depredations
farming people were often ruined. It proved the most powerful
stimulus, not only to agriculture, but to mechanics that the world
has ever known!"</p>

<p>"I read your thoughts. You anticipate with some alarm the
exhaustion of so rich a treasure. All young thinkers are very much
alike. They err from inability to combine ideas and review the
whole; not surprising that it is so, since there never has been but
one mind that could <i>thoroughly</i> combine. Those still feebler
thinkers of the nineteenth century were also apprehensive of coal
failure and sometimes uttered dismal fears that the inhabitants of
the world would perish for want of light and warmth. Now think how
much more wholesome and cleanly are our present means for obtaining
light and heat! Those younger children imagined they worshipped the
Infinite Mind as all perfect&mdash;yet never dreamed they, at the
same time, doubted Its perfection by such, fears. Perfect whole
means perfect details; perfect universe, perfect worlds; to every
grain of apparently useless soil upon them. No loss&mdash;no
death&mdash;simply <i>change</i>, which constitutes one perpetual
motion. When our carboniferous treasure shall have became
exhausted, or <i>changed</i>, be sure other changes have been
likewise working; probably ourselves the agents of such change, by
our very use of what we think a too-surely vanishing supply. The
nature of it is as impossible for us to understand as a growing
change in physical structure was to those far more ignorant people
of the past. Experience has taught us that no matter what our
righteous needs may be, the requisites for supplying them are
either awaiting our learning and research, or making correlative
growth. Then away with all doubt or fear upon what we cannot yet
take part in! We must hope and trust with a hope and trust as
infinite as our spirits."</p>

<p>All are silent and thoughtful. Before us the wretched old mine,
with its sad workers. Naked children toiling, nearly naked women
and men harnessed to carts full of coal; going through low-roofed
roadways, on hands and knees, drawing their wearying loads to the
apparatus for raising to the outer world those changed glories of
the grand, solemn old forests&mdash;the unlovely part of whose
history can only be guessed.</p>

<p>Long they have thought. I have before observed it is the
practice of this lady, after having aroused her pupils' interest,
to let them reflect awhile. At last Frederick asks, with unusual
emphasis on his words:</p>

<p>"Did the people who were called pious warm themselves by coal
obtained in so shocking a manner?"</p>

<p>At this moment his father enters. Having heard the lad's strange
question, he defers explaining the reason of his early appearance,
and answers:</p>

<p>"My son, the 'pious' people committed worse acts than that. You
know not yet half the baseness we have evolved from. You have only
reached the nineteenth century. That was scarcely past the great
transition period (reckoning downwards), when those pitiable
barbarians had begun to claim the right of their own minds to think
for themselves. You have, of course, noted how long it took before
they succeeded in quite disentangling themselves from the chains of
superstition. But when you examine the centuries below the
nineteenth&mdash;especially as will be shown in your dear mother's
mythological lectures&mdash;you will learn how sadly and
continually struggling humanity suffered from the mistaken and
bigoted beliefs of the 'pious'; so much so that the very name grew
to be hateful in the ears of the reverent truth-seeker. Evolution
is somewhat frightful&mdash;particularly while studying it
downwards&mdash;but withal a wondrously cheering study! For we know
we are rising always higher above those dreadful ages of ignorance,
with its inevitable sufferings. But I have come to end, not
continue, the lecture (taking his comrade's hand), dearest, for I
have grand news! Your sister's clever children have gained the
principal certificate in engineering. Next week they will have
honorable letters to their names! They brought me here, in their
soon-to-be famous carriage, to abridge your lecture, that we may
all fly to Waratah this afternoon&mdash;and children, we will go
over the sea now covering ancient Sydney! We shall arrive there
before two o'clock&mdash;for the 'Scud' really does make 140 miles
an hour. It gives quite new sensation! Justina and Carl are in the
court-yard. They were coming with me, but were compelled to remain
to answer questions about their invention."</p>

<p>This news gives rejoicing and excitement. Hats are quickly
adjusted, and away we almost run down the long gallery.</p>

<p>I wonder how I shall bear 140 miles, after feeling 80 so
bewildering!</p>

<p>How is this? They descend the steps and I cannot stir! I am
detained firmly&mdash;exactly at the spot where the sweetly
truthful voices of these people first charmed my ears!</p>

<p>They hasten down, wishing to seat themselves before the students
leave, otherwise they would be too long delayed.</p>

<p>Justina&mdash;a lovely woman, about twenty-nine years old,
having the same talented expression so attractive in her brother
Carl&mdash;is already surrounded by friends, who draw aside as her
relatives approach.</p>

<p>They ascend amidst pleasing congratulations, and sounds of
enthusiastic admiration follow them when their motor begins to show
some of its wonderful power, for which there is now plenty of
unoccupied space&mdash;because it wants little more than half an
hour to noon, after which time no work is permitted;&mdash;and as
these persons are both too wise and too humane to defer much to the
last hour, the streets and air are already nearly cleared of
vehicles. How swiftly my darlings are being borne from me! Only a
few minutes have passed, and I scarcely see them! My eyes ache,
and&mdash;ah me!&mdash;so does my heart. Shall we ever meet?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>POOR children of my era! How sadly and dangerously <i>you</i>
have to gain knowledge!&mdash;pent up like sheep.</p>

<p>Your tender minds and frail bodies, tried <i>two or three years
too soon</i>, and several hours too long each school-day. Little
wonder so many small coffins occupy our cemeteries&mdash;and that
legal murders are fast becoming beyond computation.</p>

<p>No child ought to be under scholastic discipline before
<i>seve</i><i>n</i> years of age, and each day no later than noon.
An hour of afternoon should be devoted by parents to assisting
their children in what few rote lessons they might have to learn.
Between that and bed-time, which ought to be at an early hour,
nothing more should tax their young minds. Night study cannot be
otherwise than injurious for children. Two days of each week their
education ought to be entirely taken charge of by one of the
parents. Ultimately, it would lead to gallery instruction, which
would benefit both children and teachers.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>WHAT a happy age is this far-off one! No skeletons of mythology

How different are their faces to those of my century!&mdash;where
nine-tenths are stamped the hideous seal of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Oh! that I might be permitted to remain! Sighing longingly, I
look upon the beautiful scene before me.</p>

<p>While thinking how delightful to live in a town so
bright&mdash;so <i>pure within as without</i>&mdash;a voice answers
my spirit's request:</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> remain! Have you forgotten how the potter's clay

porcelain, because that had once been but clay? No, you must now
leave this age. Return to your own, where so very much has to be
done. Use well and courageously your little power to aid in
crumbling those skeletons of myths. Arouse cowards, whose growing
reason has taught them disbelief in creeds&mdash;which sufficed
well enough for humankind when its nature was little higher than
that of the ape&mdash;yet who have neither the courage nor the
honor to own and act up to the great truths so surely evolved in
their inner minds. Show them the happiness&mdash;the independence
the real nobility&mdash;of <i>acting truly</i>; even though only a
few should fully understand the honesty of their lives in so doing.
Obey well. You will be rewarded by never losing sight of the light
from this age, and thus fit yourself to be one of us. Away to your
work!"</p>

<p>While the voice pronounced those last words, "mid-day song" came
rolling down the galleries. In vain I implore for one half-hour
longer, to hear that glorious music.</p>

<p>Firmly, yet sorrowfully, the voice repeats "Away!"</p>

<p>I am flying through ages of always decreasing light and beauty,
while the students' enchanting harmony rings in my ears:</p>

<p class="poem">Facts evolving,<br>
Darkness fleeing,<br>
Mists dissolving,<br>
Great truths seeing.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>I HAVE returned to our earth. Oh, what cruel disorder here
reigns! Truth crashed and persecuted! "Hypocrisy, the only evil
that walks invisible, except to God alone," flaunting in every myth
temple! howling in every community! checking progress at every
avenue.</p>

<p>Fools and rogues! You who profess so much love and reverence for
your skeletons. I tell you it is all useless that you noisily
rattle their offensive bones before my vision. That bright light of
truth from the far-off age shines to me through your blackest
screens! Go, hug your loathsome relics of a loathsome era in
privacy&mdash;if you can&mdash;and say not again to my ears what
you dare not utter to the Infinite in your solitude.</p>

<p>Ha! I see, I "obey" and do the "work" that was commanded, for
the light shines more brightly!</p>

<p>A dream? What is dreaming? Some explain most learnedly how it is
caused by certain conditions of the body. May not some dreams cause
those certain conditions?</p>

<p>Dream, or what else it has been, I see always the beautiful
light bright with truth and hope. <i>No one can extinguish
it!</i></p>
