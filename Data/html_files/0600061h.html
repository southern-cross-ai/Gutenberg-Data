ANOTHER</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 4 Apr
1916</h3>

<p class="first">TO Isongo, which stands upon the tributary of that
name, came a woman of the Isisi who had lost her husband through a
providential tree falling upon him. I say "providential," for it
was notorious that he was an evil man, a drinker of beer and a
favourite of many bad persons. Also he made magic in the forest,
and was reputedly the familiar of Bashunbi the devil brother of
M'shimba-M'shamba. He beat his wives, and once had set fire to his
house from sheer wickedness. So that when he was borne back to the
village on a grass bier and the women of his house decked
themselves with green leaves and arm in arm staggered and stamped
through the village street in their death dance, there was a
suspicion of hilarity in their song, and a more cheery step in
their dance than the occasion called for.</p>

<p>An old man named D'wiri, who knew every step of every dance, saw
this and said in his stern way that it was shameless. But he was
old and was, moreover, in fear for the decorum of his own obsequies
if these outrageous departures from custom were approved or allowed
to pass without reprimand.</p>

<p>When M'lama, the wife of G'mami, had seen her lord depart in the
canoe for burial in the middle island and had wailed her
conventional grief, she washed the dust from her body at the
river's edge and went back to her hut. And all that was grief for
the dead man was washed away with the dust of mourning.</p>

<p>Many moons came out of the sky, were wasted and died before the
woman M'lama showed signs of her gifts. It is said that they
appeared one night after a great storm wherein lightning played
such strange tricks upon the river that even the old man D'wiri
could not remember parallel instances.</p>

<p>In the night the wife of a hunter named E'sani-Osoni brought a
dying child into the hut of the widow. He had been choked by a
fish-bone and was in extremis when M'lama put her hand upon his
head and straightway the bone flew from his mouth, "and there was a
cry terrible to hear&mdash;such a cry as a leopard makes when he is
pursued by ghosts."</p>

<p>A week later a baby girl fell into a terrible fit and M'lama had
laid her hand upon it and behold! it slept from that moment.</p>

<p>Ahmet, chief of the Government spies, heard of these happenings
and came a three days' journey by river to Isongo.</p>

<p>"What are these stories of miracles?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Capita," said the chief, using the term of regard which is
employed in the Belgian Congo, "this woman M'lama is a true witch
and has great gifts, for she raises the dead by the touch of her
hand. This I have seen. Also it is said that when U'gomi, the
woodcutter, made a fault, cutting his foot in two, this woman
healed him marvellously."</p>

<p>"I will see this M'lama," said Ahmet importantly.</p>

<p>He found her in her hut tossing four bones idly. These were the
shanks of goats, and each time they fell differently.</p>

<p>"O Ahmet," she said, when he entered, "you have a wife who is
sick, also a first-born boy who does not speak though he is more
than six seasons old."</p>

<p>Ahmet squatted down by her side.</p>

<p>"Woman," said he, "tell me something that is not the talk of
river and I will believe your magic."</p>

<p>"To-morrow your master, the lord Sandi, will send you a book
which will give you happiness," she said.</p>

<p>"Every day my lord sends me a book," retorted the sceptical
Ahmet, "and each brings me happiness. Also it is common talk that
at this time there come messengers carrying bags of silver and salt
to pay men according to their services."</p>

<p>Undismayed she tried her last shot.</p>

<p>"You have a crooked finger which none can
straighten&mdash;behold!"</p>

<p>She took his hand in hers and pressed the injured phlange. A
sharp pain shot up his arm and he winced, pulling back his
hand&mdash;but the year-old dislocation which had defied the effort
of the coast doctor was straightened out, and though the movement
was exquisitely painful he could bend it.</p>

<p>"I see you are a true witch," he said, greatly impressed, for a
native has a horror of deformity of any kind, and he sent back word
of the phenomenon to Sanders.</p>

<p>Sanders at the same time was in receipt of other news which
alternately pleased him and filled him with panic. The mail had
come in by fast launch and had brought Captain Hamilton of the
Houssas a very bulky letter written in a feminine hand. He had
broken the glad news to Commissioner Sanders, but that gentleman
was not certain in his mind whether the startling intelligence
conveyed by the letter was good or bad.</p>

<p>"I'm sure the country will suit her," he said, "this part of the
country at any rate&mdash;but what will Bones say?"</p>

<p>"Bones!" repeated Captain Hamilton scornfully. "What the dickens
does it matter what Bones says?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he went to the sea-end of the verandah, and his
roar rivalled the thunder of the surf.</p>

<p>"Bones!"</p>

<p>There was no answer and for an excellent reason.</p>

<p>Sanders came out of the bungalow, his helmet on the back of his
head, a cheroot tilted dizzily.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hamilton turned.</p>

<p>"I asked him to&mdash;at least I didn't ask him, he
volunteered&mdash;to peg out a trench line."</p>

<p>"Expect an invasion?" asked Saunders.</p>

<p>Hamilton grinned.</p>

<p>"Bones does," he said. "He's full of the idea, and offered to
give me tips on the way a trench should be dug&mdash;he's feeling
rotten about things... you know what I mean. His regiment was at
Mons."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said quietly. "And you... you're a jolly good
soldier, Hamilton&mdash;how do you feel about it all?"</p>

<p>Hamilton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"They would have taken me for the Cameroons, but somebody had to
stay," he said quietly. "After all, it is one's business to... to
do one's job in the station of life to which it has pleased God to
call him. This is my work... here."</p>

<p>Sander's laid his hand on the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's the game as it should be played," he said, and his blue
eyes were as soft and tender as a woman's. "There is no war
here&mdash;we are the keepers of the King's peace, Hamilton."</p>

<p>"It's rotten..."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I feel that way myself. We're out of it&mdash;the
glory of it&mdash;the chance of it&mdash;the tragedy of it. And
there are others. Think of the men in India eating their hearts
out... praying for the order that will carry them from the comfort
of their lives to the misery and death&mdash;and the splendour, I
grant you&mdash;of war."</p>

<p>He sighed and looked wistfully to the blue sea.</p>

<p>Hamilton beckoned a Houssa corporal who was crossing the garden
of the Residency.</p>

<p>"Ho, Mustaf," he said, in his queer coast Arabic, "where shall I
look for my lord Tibbetti?"</p>

<p>The corporal turned and pointed to the woods which begin at the
back of the Residency and carry without a break for three hundred
miles.</p>

<p>"Lord, he went there carrying many strange things&mdash;also
there went with him Ali Abid, his servant."</p>

<p>Hamilton reached through an open window of the bungalow and
fished out his helmet with his walking-stick.</p>

<p>"We'll find Bones," he said grimly; "he's been gone three hours
and he's had time to re-plan Verdun."</p>

<p>It took some time to discover the working party, but when it was
found the trouble was well repaid.</p>

<p>Bones was stretched on a canvas chair under the shade of a big
Isisi palm. His helmet was tipped forward so that the brim rested
on the bridge of his nose, his thin red arms were folded on his
breast, and their gentle rise and fall testified to his shame. Two
pegs had been driven in, and between them a string sagged
half-heartedly.</p>

<p>Curled up under a near-by bush was, presumably, Ali
Abid&mdash;presumably, because all that was visible was a very
broad stretch of brown satin skin which showed between the
waistline of a pair of white cotton trousers and a duck jacket.</p>

<p>They looked down at the unconscious Bones for a long time in
silence.</p>

<p>"What will he say when I kick him?" asked Hamilton. "You can
have the first guess."</p>

<p>Sanders frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He'll say that he was thinking out a new system of
communicating trenches," he said. "He's been boring me to tears
over saps and things."</p>

<p>Hamilton shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wrong, sir," he said; "that isn't the lie he'll tell. He will
say that I kept him up so late last night working at the men's
pay-sheets that he couldn't keep awake."</p>

<p>Bones slept on.</p>

<p>"He may say that it was coffee after tiffin," suggested Sanders
after a while; "he said the other day that coffee always made him
sleep."</p>

<p>"'Swoon' was the word he used, sir," corrected Hamilton. "I
don't think he'll offer that suggestion now&mdash;the only other
excuse I can think of is that he was repeating the Bomongo
irregular verbs. Bones!"</p>

<p>He stooped and broke off a long grass and inserted it in the
right ear of Lieutenant Tibbetts, twiddling the end delicately.
Bones made a feeble clutch at his ear, but did not open his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Bones!" said Hamilton, and kicked him less gently. "Get up, you
lazy devil&mdash;there's an invasion."</p>

<p>Bones leapt to his feet and staggered a little; blinked fiercely
at his superior and saluted.</p>

<p>"Enemy on the left flank, sir," he reported stiffly. "Shall we
have dinner or take a taxi?"</p>

<p>"Wake up, Napoleon," begged Hamilton, "you're at Waterloo."</p>

<p>Bones blinked more slowly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've been unconscious, dear old officer," he
confessed. "The fact is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to this, everybody," said Hamilton admiringly.</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," said Bones, with dignity, "I fell
asleep&mdash;that beastly coffee I had after lunch, added to the
fatigue of sittin' up half the night with those jolly old accounts
of yours, got the better of me. I was sittin' down workin' out one
of the dinkiest little ideas in trenches&mdash;a sort of
communicating trench where you needn't get wet in the rainiest
weather&mdash;when I&mdash;well, I just swooned off."</p>

<p>Hamilton looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Weren't you doing anything with the Bomongo verbs?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>A light came to Bones's eyes.</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir!" he said heartily, "that was it, of course... The
last thing I remember was..."</p>

<p>"Kick that man of yours and come back to the bungalow," Hamilton
interrupted, "there's a job for you, my boy."</p>

<p>He walked across and stirred the second sleeper with the toe of
his boot.</p>

<p>Ali Abid wriggled round and sat up.</p>

<p>He was square of face, with a large mouth and two very big brown
eyes. He was enormously fat, but it was not fat of the flabby type.
Though he called himself Ali, it was, as Bones admitted, "sheer
swank" to do so, for this man had "coast" written all over him.</p>

<p>He got up slowly and saluted first his master, then Sanders, and
lastly Hamilton.</p>

<p>Bones had found him at Cape Coast Castle on the occasion of a
joy-ride which the young officer had taken on a British man-of-war.
Ali Abid had been the heaven-sent servant, and though Sanders had a
horror of natives who spoke English, the English of Ali Abid was
his very own.</p>

<p>He had been for five years the servant of Professor Garrileigh,
the eminent bacteriologist, the account of whose researches in the
field of tropical medicines fill eight volumes of closely-printed
matter, every page of which contains words which are not to be
found in most lexicons.</p>

<p>They walked back to the Residency, Ali Abid in the rear.</p>

<p>"I want you to go up to the Isongo, Bones," said Sanders; "there
may be some trouble there&mdash;a woman is working miracles."</p>

<p>"He may get a new head," murmured Hamilton, but Bones pretended
not to hear.</p>

<p>"Use your tact and get back before the 17th for the party."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;? asked Bones.</p>

<p>He had an irritating trick of employing extravagant gestures of
a fairly commonplace kind. Thus, if he desired to hear a statement
repeated &mdash;though he had heard it well enough the first
time&mdash;he would bend his head with a puzzled wrinkle of
forehead, put his hand to his ear and wait anxiously, even
painfully, for the repetition.</p>

<p>"You heard what the Commissioner said," growled Hamilton." Party
&mdash;P-A-R-T-Y."</p>

<p>"My birthday is not until April, your Excellency," said
Bones.</p>

<p>"I'd guess the date&mdash;but what's the use?" interposed
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"It isn't a birthday party, Bones," said Sanders. "We are giving
a house-warming for Miss Hamilton."</p>

<p>Bones gasped, and turned an incredulous eye upon his chief.</p>

<p>"You haven't a sister, surely, dear old officer?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why the dickens shouldn't I have a sister?" demanded his
chief.</p>

<p>Bones shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"A matter of deduction, sir," he said quietly. "Absence of all
evidence of a soothin' and lovin' influence in your lonely and
unsympathetic upbringin'; hardness of heart an' a disposition to
nag, combined with a rough and unpromisin' exterior&mdash;a sister,
good Lord!"</p>

<p>"Anyway, she's coming, Bones," said Hamilton; " and she's
looking forward to seeing you&mdash;I've written an awful lot about
you."</p>

<p>Bones smirked.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "you've overdone it a bit&mdash;women hate
to be disillusioned. What you ought to have done, sir, is to
describe me as a sort of ass&mdash;genial and all that sort of
thing, but a commonplace sort of ass."</p>

<p>Hamilton nodded.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I've done, Bones," he said. "I told her how
Bosambo did you in the eye for twenty pounds, and how you fell into
the water looking for buried treasure, and how the Isisi tried to
sell you a flying crocodile and would have sold it too, if it
hadn't been for my timely arrival. I told her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think you've said enough, sir." Bones was very red and very
haughty. "Far be it from me to resent your attitude or contradict
your calumnies. Miss Hamilton will see very little of me. An
inflexible sense of duty will keep me away from the frivolous
circle of society, sir. Alert an' sleepless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trenches," said Hamilton brutally.</p>

<p>Bones winced, regarded his superior for a moment with pain,
saluted, and turning on his heel, stalked away, followed by Ali
Abid no less pained.</p>

<p>He left at dawn the next morning, and both Sanders and Hamilton
came down to the concrete quay to see the Zaire start on her
journey. Sanders gave his final instructions&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the woman is upsetting the people, arrest her; if she has
too big a hold on them, arrest her; but if she is just amusing
them, come back."</p>

<p>"And don't forget the 17th," said Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I may arrive a little late for that," said Bones gravely. "I
don't wish to be a skeleton at your jolly old festive board, dear
old sportsman &mdash;you will excuse my absence to Miss Hamilton. I
shall probably have a headache and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>He waved a sad farewell as the Zaire passed round the bend of
the river, and looked, as he desired to look, a melancholy figure
with his huge pipe in his mouth and his hands thrust dejectedly
into his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>Once out of sight he became his own jovial self.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Ali," he said, "get out my log and put it in old
Sanders' cabin, make me a cup of tea and keep her jolly old head
east, east by north."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said Ali in excellent English.</p>

<p>The "log which Bones kept was one of the secret documents which
never come under the eye of the superior authorities. There were
such entries as&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wind N.N.W. Sea calm. Hostile craft sighted on port bow, at
10.31 a.m. General Quarters sounded 10.32. Interrogated Captain of
the hostile craft and warned him not to fish in fairway. Sighted
Cape M'Gooboori 12.17, stopped for lunch and wood."</p>

<p>What though Cape M'Gooboori was the village of that name and the
"calm sea" was no more than the placid bosom of the Great River?
What though Bones's "hostile craft" was a dilapidated canoe, manned
by one aged and bewildered man of the Isisi engaged in spearing
fish? Bones saw all things through the rosy spectacles of
adventurous youth denied its proper share of experience.</p>

<p>At sunset the Zaire came gingerly through the shoals that run
out from the Isongo beach, and Bones went ashore to conduct his
investigations. It chanced that the evening had been chosen by
M'lama, the witch, for certain wonderful manifestations, and the
village was almost deserted.</p>

<p>In a wood and in a place of green trees M'lama sat tossing her
sheep shanks, and a dense throng of solemn men and women squatted
or sat or tiptoed about her&mdash;leaving her a respectable space
for her operations. A bright fire crackled and glowed at her side,
and into this, from time to time, she thrust little sticks of
plaited straw and drew them forth blazing and spluttering until
with a quick breath she extinguished the flame and examined the
grey ash.</p>

<p>"Listen, all people," she said, "and be silent, lest my great
ju-ju strike you dead. What man gave me this?"</p>

<p>"It was I, M'lama," said an eager woman, her face wrinkled with
apprehension as she held up her brown palm.</p>

<p>The witch peered forward at the speaker.</p>

<p>"O F'sela!" she chanted, "there is a man-child for thee who
shall be greater than chiefs; also you will suffer from a sickness
which shall make you mad."</p>

<p>"O ko!"</p>

<p>Half dismayed by the promise of her own fate; half exalted by
the career the witch had sketched for her unborn son, the woman
stared incredulously, fearfully at the swaying figure by the
fire.</p>

<p>Again a plaited stick went into the fire, was withdrawn and
blown out, and the woman again prophesied.</p>

<p>And sometimes it was of honours and riches she spoke, and
sometimes &mdash;and more often&mdash;of death and disaster. Into
this shuddering group strode Bones, very finely clad in white
raiment yet limp withal, for the night was close and the way had
been long and rough.</p>

<p>The sitters scrambled to their feet, their knuckles at their
teeth, for this was a moment of great embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Oh M'lama," said Bones agreeably, and spoke in the soft dialect
of the Isisi by-the-river, "prophesy for me!"</p>

<p>She looked up sullenly, divining trouble for herself.</p>

<p>"Lord," she said, with a certain smooth venom, "there is a great
sickness for you&mdash;and behold you will go far away and die, and
none shall miss you."</p>

<p>Bones went very red, shook an indignant forefinger at the
offending prophetess.</p>

<p>"You're a wicked old storyteller!" he stammered. "You're
depressin' the people&mdash;you naughty girl! I hate you&mdash;I
simply loathe you!"</p>

<p>As he spoke in English she was not impressed.</p>

<p>"Goin' about the country puttin' people off their grub, by
Jove!" he stormed; "tellin' stories... oh dash it, I shall have to
be awfully severe with you!"</p>

<p>Severe he was, for he arrested her, to the relief of her
audience, who waited long enough to discover whether or not her
ju-ju would strike him dead, and being obviously disappointed by
her failure to provide this spectacle, melted away.</p>

<p>Close to the gangway of the Zaire she persuaded one of her
Houssa guard to release his hold. She persuaded him by the simple
expedient of burying her sharp white teeth in the fleshy part of
his arm&mdash;and bolted. They captured her half mad with panic and
fear of her unknown fate, and brought her to the boat.</p>

<p>Bones, fussing about the struggling group, dancing with
excitement, was honourably wounded by the chance contact of his
nose with a wild and whirling fist.</p>

<p>"Put her in the store cabin!" he commanded breathlessly. "Oh,
what a wicked woman!"</p>

<p>In the morning as the boat got under way Ali came to him with a
distressing story.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency will be pained to hear," he said, "that the
female prisoner has eradicated her costume."</p>

<p>"Eradicated... ? " repeated the puzzled Bones, gently touching
the patch of sticking-plaster on his nose.</p>

<p>"In the night," explained this former slave of science, "the
subject has developed symptoms of mania, and has entirely dispensed
with her clothes&mdash;to wit, by destruction."</p>

<p>"She's torn up her clothes?" gasped Bones, his hair rising, and
Ali nodded.</p>

<p>Now, the dress of a native woman varies according to the degree
in which she falls under missionary influence. Isongo was well
within the sphere of the River Mission, and so M'lama's costume
consisted of a tight-fitting piece of print which wound round and
round the body in the manner of a kilt, covering the figure from
armpit to feet.</p>

<p>Bones went to the open window of the prison cabin, and
steadfastly averting his gaze, called&mdash;</p>

<p>"M'lama!"</p>

<p>No reply came, and he called again.</p>

<p>"M'lama," he said gently, in the river dialect, "what shall
Sandi say to this evil that you do?"</p>

<p>There was no reply, only a snuffling sound of woe.</p>

<p>"Oh, ai!" sobbed the voice.</p>

<p>"M'lama, presently we shall come to the Mission house where the
God-men are, and I will bring you clothing&mdash;these you will put
on you," said Bones, still staring blankly over the side of the
ship at the waters which foamed past her low hull; for if my lord
Sandi see you as I see you&mdash;I mean as I wouldn't for the world
see you, you improper person," he corrected himself hastily in
English&mdash;"if my lord Sandi saw you, he would feel great shame.
Also," he added, as a horrible thought made him go cold all over,
"also the lady who comes to my lord Militini&mdash;oh lor!"</p>

<p>These last two words were in English.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a Jesuit settlement near-by, and here
Bones stopped and interviewed the stout and genial priest in
charge.</p>

<p>"It's curious how they all do it," reflected the priest, as he
led the way to his storehouse. "I've known 'em to tear up their
clothes in an East End police cell&mdash;white folk, the same as
you and I."</p>

<p>He rummaged in a big box and produced certain garments.</p>

<p>"My last consignment from a well-meaning London congregation,"
he smiled, and flung out a heap of dresses, hats, stockings and
shoes. "If they'd sent a roll or two of print I might have used
them&mdash;but strong religious convictions do not entirely
harmonize with a last year's Paris model."</p>

<p>Bones, flushed and unhappy, grabbed an armful of clothing, and
showering the chuckling priest with an incoherent medley of apology
and thanks, hurried back to the Zaire.</p>

<p>"Behold, M'lama," he said, as he thrust his loot through the
window of the little deck-house, "there are many grand things such
as great ladies wear&mdash;now you shall appear before Sandi
beautiful to see."</p>

<p>He logged the happening in characteristic language, and was in
the midst of this literary exercise when the tiny steamer charged a
sandbank, and before her engines could slow or reverse she had slid
to the top and rested in two feet of water.</p>

<p>A rueful Bones surveyed the situation and returned to his cabin
to conclude his diary with&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"12.19 struck a reef off B'lidi Bay. Fear vessel
total wreck. Boats all ready for lowering."</p>
<br>

<p>As a matter of fact there were neither boats to lower nor need
to lower them, because the crew were already standing in the river
(up to their hips) and were endeavouring to push the Zaire to deep
water.</p>

<p>In this they were unsuccessful, and it was not for thirty-six
hours until the river, swollen by heavy rains in the Ochori region,
lifted the Zaire clear of the obstruction, that Bones might record
the story of his salvage.</p>

<p>He had released a reformed M'lama to the greater freedom of the
deck, and save for a shrill passage at arms between that lady and
the corporal she had bitten, there was no sign of a return to her
evil ways. She wore a white pique skirt and a white blouse, and on
her head she balanced deftly, without the aid of pins, a yellow
straw hat with long trailing ribbons of heliotrope. Alternately
they trailed behind and before.</p>

<p>"A horrible sight," said Bones, shuddering at his first glimpse
of her.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was uneventful until the Zaire had
reached the northernmost limits of the Residency reserve. Sanders
had partly cleared and wholly drained four square miles of the
little peninsula on which the Residency stood, and by barbed wire
and deep cutting had isolated the government estate from the wild
forest land to the north.</p>

<p>Here, the river shoals in the centre, cutting a passage to the
sea through two almost unfathomable channels close to the eastern
and western banks. Bones had locked away his journal and was
standing on the bridge rehearsing the narrative which was to
impress his superiors with a sense of his resourcefulness&mdash;and
incidentally present himself in the most favourable light to the
new factor which was coming into his daily life.</p>

<p>He had thought of Hamilton's sister at odd intervals and
now...</p>

<p>The Zaire was hugging the western bank so closely that a bold
and agile person might have stepped ashore.</p>

<p>M'lama, the witch, was both bold and agile.</p>

<p>He turned with open mouth to see something white and feminine
leap the space between deck and shore, two heliotrope ribbons
streaming wildly in such breeze as there was.</p>

<p>"Hi! Don't do that... naughty, naughty!" yelled the agonized
Bones, but she had disappeared into the undergrowth before the big
paddle-wheel of the Zaire began to thresh madly astern.</p>

<p>Never was the resourcefulness of Bones more strikingly
exemplified. An ordinary man would have leapt overboard in pursuit,
but Bones was no ordinary man. He remembered in that moment of
crisis, the distressing propensity of his prisoner to the
"eradication of garments." With one stride he was in his cabin and
had snatched a counterpane from his bed, in two bounds he was over
the rail on the bank and running swiftly in the direction the
fugitive had taken.</p>

<p>For a little time he did not see her, then he glimpsed the white
of a pique dress, and with a yell of admonition started in
pursuit.</p>

<p>She stood hesitating a moment, then fled, but he was on her
before she had gone a dozen yards; the counterpane was flung over
her head, and though she kicked and struggled and indulged in
muffled squeaks, he lifted her up in his arms and staggered back to
the boat.</p>

<p>They ran out a gangway plank and across this he passed with his
burden, declining all offers of assistance.</p>

<p>"Close the window," he gasped; "open the door&mdash;now, you
naughty old lady!"</p>

<p>He bundled her in, counterpane enmeshed and reduced to helpless
silence, slammed the door and leant panting against the cabin,
mopping his brow.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Bones, and repeated the inelegant remark many
times. All this happened almost within sight of the quay on which
Sanders and Hamilton were waiting. It was a very important young
man who saluted them.</p>

<p>"All correct, sir," said Bones, stiff as a ramrod; " no
casualties &mdash;except as per my nose which will be noted in the
margin of my report&mdash;one female prisoner secured after heroic
chase, which, I trust, sir, you will duly report to my jolly old
superiors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't gas so much, Bones," said Hamilton. "Come along and meet
my sister&mdash;hullo, what the devil's that?"</p>

<p>They turned with one accord to the forest path.</p>

<p>Two native policemen were coming towards them, and between them
a bedraggled M'lama, her skirt all awry, her fine hat at a rakish
angle, stepped defiantly.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" said Bones, "she's got away again... That's my
prisoner, dear old officer!"</p>

<p>Hamilton frowned.</p>

<p>"I hope she hasn't frightened Pat... she was walking in the
reservation."</p>

<p>Bones did not faint, his knees went from under him, but he
recovered by clutching the arm of his faithful Ali.</p>

<p>"Dear old friend," he murmured brokenly, "accidents... error of
judgment... the greatest tragedy of my life... "</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded Sanders in alarm, for the
face of Bones was ghastly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tibbetts made no reply, but walked with unsteady
steps to the lock-up, fumbled with the key and opened the door.</p>

<p>There stepped forth a dishevelled and wrathful girl (she was a
little scared, too, I suspect), the most radiant and lovely figure
that had ever dawned on the horizon of Bones.</p>

<p>She looked from her staggered brother to Sanders, from Sanders
to her miserable custodian.</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;" began Hamilton.</p>

<p>Then her lips twitched and she fell into a fit of uncontrollable
laughter.</p>

<p>"If," said Bones huskily, "if in an excess of zeal I mistook...
in the gloamin', madame... white dress... "</p>

<p>He spread out his arms in a gesture of extravagant despair.</p>

<p>"I can do no more than a gentleman... I have a loaded revolver
in my cabin... farewell!"</p>

<p>He bowed deeply to the girl, saluted his dumbfounded chief,
tripped up over a bucket and would have fallen but for Hamilton's
hand.</p>

<p>"You're an ass," said Hamilton, struggling to preserve his sense
of annoyance. "Pat&mdash;this is Lieutenant Tibbetts, of whom I
have often written."</p>

<p>The girl looked at Bones, her eyes moist with laughter.</p>

<p>"I guessed it from the first," she said, and Bones writhed.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02">II. &mdash; BONES CHANGES HIS
RELIGION</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published as "The Branding of Bones" in <i>The Windsor
Magazine</i>, Vol. 44, Jul 1916, pp 141-148</h3>

<p class="first">CAPTAIN HAMILTON of the King's Houssas had two
responsibilities in life, a sister and a subaltern.</p>

<p>The sister's name was Patricia Agatha, the subaltern had been
born Tibbetts, christened Augustus, and named by Hamilton in his
arbitrary way, "Bones."</p>

<p>Whilst sister and subaltern were separated from one another by
some three thousand miles of ocean&mdash;as far, in fact, as the
Coast is from Bradlesham Thorpe in the County of
Hampshire&mdash;Captain Hamilton bore his responsibilities without
displaying a sense of the burden.</p>

<p>When Patricia Hamilton decided on paying a visit to her brother
she did so with his heartiest approval, for he did not realize that
in bringing his two responsibilities face to face he was not only
laying the foundation of serious trouble, but was actually engaged
in erecting the fabric.</p>

<p>Pat Hamilton had come and had been boisterously welcomed by her
brother one white-hot morning, Houssas in undress uniform lining
the beach and gazing solemnly upon Militini's riotous joy. Mr.
Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., had given her a more formal welcome,
for he was a little scared of women. Bones, as we know, had not
been present&mdash;which was unfortunate in more ways than one.</p>

<p>It made matters no easier for the wretched Bones that Miss
Hamilton was an exceedingly lovely lady. Men who lived for a long
time in native lands and see little save beautiful figures
displayed without art and with very little adornment, are apt to
regard any white woman with regular features as pretty, when the
vision comes to them after a long interval spent amidst native
people. But it needed neither contrast nor comparison to induce an
admiration for Captain Hamilton's sister.</p>

<p>She was of a certain Celtic type, above the medium height, with
the freedom of carriage and gait which is the peculiar possession
of her countrywomen. Her face was a true oval, and her complexion
of that kind which tans readily but does not freckle.</p>

<p>Eyes and mouth were firm and steadfast; she was made for ready
laughter, yet she was deep enough, and in eyes and mouth alike you
read a tenderness beyond disguise. She had a trinity of admirers:
her brother's admiration was natural and critical; Sanders admired
and feared; Lieutenant Tibbetts admired and resented.</p>

<p>From the moment when Bones strode off after the painful
discovery, had slammed the door of his hut and had steadfastly
declined all manner of food and sustenance, he had voluntarily cut
himself off from his kind.</p>

<p>He met Hamilton on parade the following morning, hollow-eyed (as
he hoped) after a sleepless night, and there was nothing in his
attitude suggestive of the deepest respect and the profoundest
regard for that paragraph of King's Regulations which imposes upon
the junior officer a becoming attitude of humility in the presence
of his superior officer.</p>

<p>"How is your head, Bones?" asked Hamilton, after the parade had
been dismissed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Bones bitterly&mdash;though why he should
be bitter at the kindly inquiry only he knew&mdash;"thank you sir,
it is about the same. My temperature is&mdash;or was&mdash;up to
one hundred and four, and I have been delirious. I wouldn't like to
say, dear old-sir, that I'm not nearly delirious now."</p>

<p>"Come up to tiffin," invited Hamilton.</p>

<p>Bones saluted&mdash;a sure preliminary to a dramatic
oration.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said firmly, "you've always been a jolly old officer
to me before this contretemps wrecked my young life&mdash;but I
shall never be quite the same man again, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass," begged Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Revile me, sir," said Bones dismally; "give me a dangerous
mission, one of those jolly old adventures where a feller takes his
life in one hand, his revolver in the other, but don't ask
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My sister wants to see you," said Hamilton, cutting short the
flow of eloquence.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Bones hollowly, and strode into his hut.</p>

<p>"And what I'm going to do with him, Heaven knows," groaned
Hamilton at tiffin. "The fact is, Pat, your arrival on the scene
has thoroughly demoralized him."</p>

<p>The girl folded her serviette and walked to the window, and
stood looking out over the yellow stretch of the deserted
parade-ground.</p>

<p>"I'm going to call on Bones," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Poor Bones!" murmured Sanders.</p>

<p>"That's very rude!" She took down her solar helmet from the peg
behind the door and adjusted it carefully. Then she stepped through
the open door, whistling cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind, sir," apologized Hamilton, "but we've
never succeeded in stopping her habit of whistling."</p>

<p>Sanders laughed.</p>

<p>"It would be strange if she didn't whistle," he said
cryptically.</p>

<p>Bones was lying on his back, his hands behind his head. A
half-emptied tin of biscuits, no less than the remnants of a box of
chocolates, indicated that anchorite as he was determined to be,
his austerity did not run in the direction of starvation.</p>

<p>His mind was greatly occupied by a cinematograph procession of
melancholy pictures. Perhaps he would go away, far, far, into the
interior. Even into the territory of the great king where a man's
life is worth about five cents net. And as day by day passed and no
news came of him&mdash;as how could it when his habitation was
marked by a cairn of stones?&mdash;she would grow anxious and
unhappy. And presently messengers would come bringing her a few
poor trinkets he had bequeathed to her&mdash;a wrist-watch, a
broken sword, a silver cigarette-case dented with the arrow that
slew him&mdash;and she would weep silently in the loneliness of her
room.</p>

<p>And perhaps he would find strength to send a few scrawled words
asking for her pardon, and the tears would well up in her beautiful
grey eyes&mdash;as they were already welling in Bones's eyes at the
picture he drew&mdash;and she would know&mdash;all.</p>

<p>"Phweet!"</p>

<p>Or else, maybe he would be stricken down with fever, and she
would want to come and nurse him, but he would refuse.</p>

<p>"Tell her," he would say weakly, but oh, so bravely, "tell
her... I ask only... her pardon."</p>

<p>"Phweet!"</p>

<p>Bones heard the second whistle. It came from the open window
immediately above his head. A song bird was a rare visitor to these
parts, but he was too lazy and too absorbed to look up.</p>

<p>Perhaps (he resumed) she would never see him again, never know
the deep sense of injustice...</p>

<p>"Phwee-et!"</p>

<p>It was clearer and more emphatic, and he half turned his head to
look&mdash;</p>

<p>He was on his feet in a second, his hand raised to his damp
forehead, for leaning on the window sill, her lips pursed for yet
another whistle, was the lady of his thoughts.</p>

<p>She met his eyes sternly.</p>

<p>"Come outside&mdash;misery!" she said, and Bones gasped and
obeyed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean," she demanded, "by sulking in your wretched
little hut when you ought to be crawling about on your hands and
knees begging my pardon?"</p>

<p>Bones said nothing.</p>

<p>"Bones," said this outrageous girl, shaking her head
reprovingly, "you want a jolly good slapping!"</p>

<p>Bones extended his bony wrist.</p>

<p>"Slap!" he said defiantly.</p>

<p>He had hardly issued the challenge when a very firm young palm,
driven by an arm toughened by long acquaintance with the royal and
ancient game, came "Smack!" and Bones winced.</p>

<p>"Play the game, dear old Miss Hamilton," he said, rubbing his
wrist.</p>

<p>"Play the game yourself, dear old Bones," she mimicked him. "You
ought to be ashamed of yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let bygones be bygones, jolly old Miss Hamilton," begged Bones
magnanimously. "And now that I see you're a sport, put it there, if
it weighs a ton."</p>

<p>And he held out his nobbly hand and caught the girl's in a grip
that made her grimace.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was walking her round the married quarters
of his Houssas, telling her the story of his earliest love affair.
She was an excellent listener, and seldom interrupted him save to
ask if there was any insanity in his family, or whether the girl
was short-sighted; in fact, as Bones afterwards said, it might have
been Hamilton himself.</p>

<p>"What on earth are they finding to talk about?" wondered
Sanders, watching the confidences from the depths of a big cane
chair on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Bones," replied Hamilton lazily, "is telling her the story of
his life and how he saved the territories from rebellion. He's also
begging her not to breathe a word of this to me for fear of hurting
my feelings."</p>

<p>At that precise moment Bones was winding up a most immodest
recital of his accomplishments with a less immodest footnote.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear old Miss Hamilton," he was saying, lowering his
voice, "I shouldn't like a word of this to come to your jolly old
brother's ears. He's an awfully good sort, but naturally in
competition with an agile mind like mine, understanding the native
as I do, he hasn't an earthly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you write the story of your adventures?" she asked
innocently. "It would sell like hot cakes."</p>

<p>Bones choked with gratification.</p>

<p>"Precisely my idea&mdash;oh, what a mind you've got! What a pity
it doesn't run in the family! I'll tell you a precious
secret&mdash;not a word to anybody&mdash;honest?"</p>

<p>"Honest," she affirmed.</p>

<p>Bones looked round.</p>

<p>"It's practically ready for the publisher," he whispered, and
stepped back to observe the effect of his words.</p>

<p>She shook her head in admiration, her eyes were dancing with
delight, and Bones realized that here at last he had met a kindred
soul.</p>

<p>"It must be awfully interesting to write books," she sighed.
"I've tried&mdash;but can never invent anything."</p>

<p>"Of course, in my case&mdash;" corrected Bones.</p>

<p>"I suppose you just sit down with a pen in your hand and imagine
all sorts of things," she mused, directing her feet to the
Residency.</p>

<p>"This is the story of my life," explained Bones earnestly. "Not
fiction... but all sorts of adventures that actually happened.</p>

<p>"To whom?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To me," claimed Bones, louder than was necessary.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said.</p>

<p>"Don't start 'Oh-ing,'" said Bones in a huff. "If you and I are
going to be good friends, dear old Miss Hamilton, don't say 'Oh!'
"</p>

<p>"Don't be a bully, Bones." She turned on him so fiercely that he
shrank back.</p>

<p>"Play the game," he said feebly; "play the game, dear old
sister!"</p>

<p>She led him captive to the stoep and deposited him in the
easiest chair she could find.</p>

<p>From that day he ceased to be anything but a slave, except on
one point.</p>

<p>The question of missions came up at tiffin, and Miss Hamilton
revealed the fact that she favoured the High Church and held
definite views on the clergy.</p>

<p>Bones confessed that he was a Wesleyan.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you're a Nonconformist?" she asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"That's my dinky little religion, dear old Miss Hamilton," said
Bones. "I'd have gone into the Church only I hadn't
enough&mdash;enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Brains?" suggested Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Call is the word," said Bones. "I wasn't called&mdash;or if I
was I was out&mdash;haw-haw! That's a rippin' little bit of
persiflage, Miss Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"Be serious, Bones," said the girl; "you mustn't joke about
things."</p>

<p>She put him through a cross-examination to discover the extent
of his convictions. In self-defence Bones, with only the haziest
idea of the doctrine he defended, summarily dismissed certain of
Miss Hamilton's most precious beliefs.</p>

<p>"But, Bones," she persisted, "if I asked you to
change&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bones shook his head.</p>

<p>"Dear old friend," he said solemnly, "there are two things I'll
never do&mdash;alter the faith of my distant but happy youth, or
listen to one disparagin' word about the jolliest old sister that
ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do. Bones," she said, with dignity. "I can see that
you don't like me as I thought you did&mdash;what do you think, Mr.
Sanders?"</p>

<p>Sanders smiled.</p>

<p>"I can hardly judge&mdash;you see," he added apologetically,
"I'm a Wesleyan too."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Patricia, and fled in confusion.</p>

<p>Bones rose in silence, crossed to his chief and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said brokenly.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing?" snarled Sanders.</p>

<p>"Spoken like a true Christian, dear old Excellency and sir,"
murmured Bones. "We'll bring her back to the fold."</p>

<p>He stepped nimbly to the door, and the serviette ring that
Sanders threw with unerring aim caught his angular shoulder as he
vanished.</p>

<p>That same night Sanders had joyful news to impart. He came into
the Residency to find Bones engaged in mastering the art of
embroidery under the girl's tuition.</p>

<p>Sanders interrupted what promised to be a most artistic
execution.</p>

<p>"Who says a joy-ride to the upper waters of the Isisi?"</p>

<p>Hamilton jumped up.</p>

<p>"Joy-ride?" he said, puzzled.</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"We leave to-morrow for the Lesser Isisi to settle a religious
palaver&mdash;Bucongo of the Lesser Isisi is getting a little too
enthusiastic a Christian, and Ahmet has been sending some queer
reports. I've been putting off the palaver for weeks, but
Administration says it has no objection to my making a picnic of
duty&mdash;so we'll all go."</p>

<p>"Tri-umph!" said Hamilton. "Bones, leave your needlework and go
overhaul the stores."</p>

<p>Bones, kneeling on a chair, his elbows on the table, looked
up.</p>

<p>"As jolly old Francis Drake said when the Spanish
Armada&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To the stores, you insubordinate beggar!" commanded Hamilton,
and Bones made a hurried exit.</p>

<p>The accommodation of the Zaire was limited, but there was the
launch, a light-draught boat which was seldom used except for
tributary work.</p>

<p>"I could put Bones in charge of the Wiggle," he said, "but he'd
be pretty sure to smash her up. Miss Hamilton will have my cabin,
and you and I could take the two smaller cabins."</p>

<p>Bones, to whom it was put, leapt at the suggestion, brushing
aside all objections. They were answered before they were
framed.</p>

<p>As for the girl, she was beside herself with joy. "Will there be
any fighting?" she asked breathlessly. "Shall we be attacked?"</p>

<p>Sanders shook his head smilingly.</p>

<p>"All you have to do," said Bones confidently, "is to stick to
me. Put your faith in old Bones. When you see the battle swayin'
an' it isn't certain which way it's goin', look for my jolly old
banner wavin' above the stricken field."</p>

<p>"And be sure it is his banner," interrupted Hamilton, "and not
his large feet. Now the last time we had a fight... "</p>

<p>And he proceeded to publish and utter a scandalous libel, Bones
protesting incoherently the while.</p>

<p>The expedition was on the point of starting when Hamilton took
his junior aside.</p>

<p>"Bones," he said, not unkindly, "I know you're a whale of a
navigator, and all that sort of thing, and my sister, who has an
awfully keen sense of humour, would dearly love to see you at the
helm of the Wiggle, but as the Commissioner wants to make a
holiday, I think it would be best if you left the steering to one
of the boys."</p>

<p>Bones drew himself up stiffly.</p>

<p>"Dear old officer," he said aggrieved, "I cannot think that you
wish to speak disparagingly of my intelligence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get that silly idea out of your head," said Hamilton. "That is
just what I'm trying to do."</p>

<p>"I'm under your jolly old orders, sir," Bones said with the air
of an early Christian martyr, "and according to Paragraph 156 of
King's Regulations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let us go into that," said Hamilton. "I'm not giving you
any commands, I'm merely making a sensible suggestion. Of course,
if you want to make an ass of yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have never had the slightest inclination that way, cheery old
sir," said Bones, "and I'm not likely at my time of life to be
influenced by my surroundings."</p>

<p>He saluted again and made his way to the barracks. Bones had a
difficulty in packing his stores. In truth they had all been packed
before he reached the Wiggle, and to an unprofessional eye they
were packed very well indeed, but Bones had them turned out and
packed his way. When that was done, and it was obvious to the
meanest intelligence that the Wiggle was in terrible danger of
capsizing before she started, the stores were unshipped and
rearranged under the directions of the fuming Hamilton.</p>

<p>When the third packing was completed, the general effect bore a
striking resemblance to the position of the stores as Bones had
found them when he came to the boat. When everybody was ready to
start, Bones remembered that he had forgotten his log-book, and
there was another wait.</p>

<p>"Have you got everything now?" asked Sanders wearily, leaning
over the rail.</p>

<p>"Everything, sir," said Bones, with a salute to his superior,
and a smile to the girl.</p>

<p>"Have you got your hot-water bottle and your hair-curlers?"
demanded Hamilton offensively.</p>

<p>Bones favoured him with a dignified stare, made a signal to the
engineer, and the Wiggle started forward, as was her wont, with a
jerk which put upon Bones the alternative of making a most
undignified sprawl or clutching a very hot smoke-stack. He chose
the latter, recovered his balance with an easy grace, punctiliously
saluted the tiny flag of the Zaire as he whizzed past her, and
under the very eyes of Hamilton, with all the calmness in the
world, took the wheel from the steersman's hand and ran the Wiggle
shore. All this he did in the brief space of three minutes. "And,"
said Hamilton, exasperated to a degree, "if you'd only broken your
infernal head, the accident would have been worth it."</p>

<p>It took half an hour for the Wiggle to get afloat again. She had
run up the beach, and it was necessary to unload the stores, carry
them back to the quay and reload her again. "Now are you ready?"
said Sanders.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said Bones, abased but nautical.</p>

<p>Bucongo, the chief of the Lesser Isisi folk, had a dispute with
his brother-in-law touching a certain matter which affected his
honour. It affected his life eventually, since his relative was
found one morning dead of a spear-thrust. This Sanders discovered
after the big trial which followed certain events described
hereafter.</p>

<p>The brother-in-law in his malice had sworn that Bucongo held
communion with devils. It is a fact that Bucongo had, at an early
age, been captured by Catholic missionaries, and had spent an
uncomfortable youth mastering certain mysterious rites and
ceremonies. His brother-in-law had been in the blessed service of
another missionary who taught that God lived in the river, and that
to fully benefit by his ju-ju it was necessary to be immersed in
the flowing stream.</p>

<p>Between the water-God men and the cross-God men there was ever a
feud, each speaking disparagingly of the other, though converts to
each creed had this in common, that neither understood completely
the faith into which they were newly admitted. The advantage lay
with the Catholic converts because they were given a pewter medal
with hearts and sun like radiations engraved thereon (this medal
was admittedly a cure for toothache and pains in the stomach),
whilst the Protestants had little beyond a mysterious something
that they referred to as A'lamo&mdash;which means Grace.</p>

<p>But when taunted by their medal-flaunting rivals and challenged
to produce this "Grace," they were crestfallen and ashamed, being
obliged to admit that A'lamo was an invisible magic which (they
stoutly affirmed) was nevertheless an excellent magic, since it
preserved one from drowning and cured warts and boils.</p>

<p>Bucongo, the most vigorous partisan of the cross-God men, and an
innovator of ritual, found amusement in watching the Baptist
missionaries standing knee-deep in the river washing the souls of
the converts.</p>

<p>He had even been insolent to young Ferguson, the earnest leader
of the American Baptist Mission, and to his intense amazement had
been suddenly floored with a left-hander delivered by the sometime
Harvard middle weight.</p>

<p>He carried his grievance and a lump on his jaw to Mr.
Commissioner Sanders, who had arrived at the junction of the Isisi
and the N'gomi rivers and was holding his palaver, and Sanders had
been unsympathetic.</p>

<p>"Go worship your God in peace," said Sanders, "and let all other
men worship theirs; and say no evil word to white men for these are
very quick to anger. Also it is unbecoming that a black man should
speak scornfully to his masters."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Bucongo, "in heaven all men are as one, black or
white."</p>

<p>"In heaven," said Sanders, "we will settle that palaver, but
here on the river we hold our places by our merits. Tomorrow I come
to your village to inquire into certain practices of which the
God-men know nothing&mdash;this palaver is finished."</p>

<p>Now Bucongo was something more than a convert. He was a man of
singular intelligence and of surprising originality. He had been a
lay missioner of the Church, and had made many converts to a
curious religion, the ritual of which was only half revealed to the
good Jesuit fathers when at a great palaver which Bucongo summoned
to exhibit his converts, the Church service was interspersed with
the sacrifice of a goat and a weird procession and dance which left
the representative of The Order speechless. Bucongo was called
before a conference of the Mission and reprimanded.</p>

<p>He offered excuses, but there was sufficient evidence to prove
that this enthusiastic Christian had gone systematically to work,
to found what amounted to a religion of his own.</p>

<p>The position was a little delicate, and any other Order than the
Jesuits might have hesitated to tackle a reform which meant losing
a very large membership.</p>

<p>The fate of Bucongo's congregation had been decided when, in his
anger, he took canoe, and travelling for half a day, came to the
principal Mission.</p>

<p>Father Carpentier, full-bearded, red of face and brawny of arm,
listened in the shade of his hut, pulling thoughtfully at a long
pipe.</p>

<p>"And so, Pentini," concluded Bucongo, "even Sandi puts shame on
me because I am a cross-God man, and he by all accounts is of the
water-God ju-ju."</p>

<p>The father eyed this perturbed sheep of his flock
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"O Bucongo," he said gently, "in the river lands are many
beasts. Those which fly and which swim; those that run swiftly and
that hide in the earth. Now who of these is right?"</p>

<p>"Lord, they are all right but are of different ways," said
Bucongo.</p>

<p>Father Carpentier nodded.</p>

<p>"Also in the forest are two ants&mdash;one who lives in tree
nests, and one who has a home deep in the ground. They are of a
kind, and have the same business. Yet God put it into the little
heads of one to climb trees, and of the other to burrow deeply.
Both are right and neither are wrong, save when the tree ant meets
the ground ant and fights him. Then both are wrong."</p>

<p>The squatting Bucongo rose sullenly.</p>

<p>"Master," he said, "these mysteries are too much for a poor man.
I think I know a better ju-ju, and to him I go."</p>

<p>"You have no long journey, Chief," said the father sternly, "for
they tell me stories of ghost dances in the forest and a certain
Bucongo who is the leader of these&mdash;and of a human sacrifice.
Also of converts who are branded with a cross of hot iron."</p>

<p>The chief looked at his sometime tutor with face twisted and
puckered with rage, and turning without a word, walked back to his
canoe.</p>

<p>The next morning Father Carpentier sent a messenger to Sanders
bearing an urgent letter, and Sanders read the closely written
lines with a troubled frown.</p>

<p>He put down the letter and came out on to the deck, to find
Hamilton fishing over the side of the steamer. Hamilton looked
round.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Bucongo of the Lesser Isisi is wrong," said Sanders. "I have
heard of his religious meetings and have been a little
worried&mdash;there will be a big ju-ju palaver or I'm very much
mistaken. Where is Bones?"</p>

<p>"He has taken my sister up the creek&mdash;Bones says there are
any number of egrets' nests there, and I believe he is right."</p>

<p>Sanders frowned again.</p>

<p>"Send a canoe to fetch him back," he said. "That is Bucongo's
territory, and I don't trust the devil."</p>

<p>"Which one&mdash;Bones or Bucongo?" asked Hamilton
innocently.</p>

<p>But Sanders was not feeling humorous.</p>

<p>At that precise moment Bones was sitting before the most
fantastic religious assembly that ecclesiastic or layman had ever
attended.</p>

<p>Fate and Bones had led the girl through a very pleasant forest
glade &mdash;they left the light-draught Wiggle half a mile down
stream owing to the shoals which barred their progress, and had
come upon Bucongo in an exalted moment.</p>

<p>With the assurance that he was doing no more than intrude upon
one of those meetings which the missionizing Chief of the Lesser
Isisi so frequently held. Bones stood on the outer fringe of the
circle which sat in silence to watch an unwilling novitiate getting
acquainted with Bucongo's god.</p>

<p>The novice was a girl, and she lay before an altar of stones
surmounted by a misshapen beti who glared with his one eye upon the
devout gathering. The novice lay rigid, for the excellent reason
that she was roped foot and hands to two pegs in the ground.</p>

<p>Before the altar itself was a fire of wood in which two irons
were heating.</p>

<p>Bones did not take this in for a moment, for he was gazing
open-mouthed at Bucongo. On his head was an indubitable mitre, but
around the mitre was bound a strip of skin from which was suspended
a circle of dangling monkey tails. For cope he wore a leopard's
robe. His face was streaked red with camwood, and around his eyes
he had painted two white circles.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of a frenzied address when the two white
visitors came upon the scene, and his hand was outstretched to take
the red branding-iron when the girl at Bones's side, with a little
gasp of horror, broke into the circle, and wrenching the rough iron
from the attendant's hand, flung it towards the circle of
spectators, which widened in consequence.</p>

<p>"How dare you&mdash;how dare you!" she demanded breathlessly,
"you horrible-looking man!"</p>

<p>Bucongo glared at her but said nothing; then he turned to meet
Bones.</p>

<p>In that second of time Bucongo had to make a great decision, and
to overcome the habits of a lifetime. Training and education to the
dominion of the white man half raised his hand to the salute;
something that boiled and bubbled madly and set his shallow brain
afire, something that was of his ancestry, wild, unreasoning,
brutish, urged other action. Bones had his revolver half drawn when
the knobbly end of the chief's killing-spear struck him between the
eyes, and he went down on his knees.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, that he found himself sitting before
Bucongo, his hands and feet tied with native grass, with the girl
at his side in no better case.</p>

<p>She was very frightened, but this she did not show. She had the
disadvantage of being unable to understand the light flow of
offensive badinage which passed between her captor and Bones.</p>

<p>"O Tibbetti," said Bucongo, "you see me as a god&mdash;I have
finished with all white men."</p>

<p><a id="pic1" name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a>
</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src="0600061h-images/A06-Pic01.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>"Soon we shall finish with you, Bucongo," said Bones.</p>

<p>"I cannot die, Tibbetti," said the other with easy confidence,
"that is the wonderful thing."</p>

<p>"Other men have said that," said Bones in the vernacular, "and
their widows are wives again and have forgotten their
widowhood."</p>

<p>"This is a new ju-ju, Tibbetti," said Bucongo, a strange light
in his eyes. "I am the greatest of all cross-God men, and it is
revealed to me that many shall follow me. Now you and the woman
shall be the first of all white people to bear the mark of Bucongo
the Blessed. And in the days to be you shall bear your breasts and
say, 'Bucongo the Wonderful did this with his beautiful hands.'
"</p>

<p>Bones was in a cold sweat and his mouth was dry. He scarcely
dare look at the girl by his side.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" she asked in a low voice. Bones hesitated,
and then haltingly he stammered the translation of the threat.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"O Bucongo," said Bones, with a sudden inspiration, "though you
do evil, I will endure. But this you shall do and serve me. Brand
me alone upon the chest, and upon the back. For if we be branded
separately we are bound to one another, and you see how ugly this
woman is with her thin nose and her pale eyes; also she has long
hair like the grass which the weaver birds use for their
nests."</p>

<p>He spoke loudly, eagerly, and it seemed convincingly, for
Bucongo was in doubt. Truly the woman by all standards was very
ugly. Her face was white and her lips thin. She was a narrow woman
too, he thought, like one underfed.</p>

<p>"This you will do for me, Bucongo," urged Bones; "for gods do
not do evil things, and it would be bad to marry me to this ugly
woman who has no hips and has an evil tongue."</p>

<p>Bucongo was undecided.</p>

<p>"A god may do no evil," he said; "but I do not know the ways of
white men. If it be true, then I shall mark you twice Tibbetti, and
you shall be my man for ever; and the woman I will not touch."</p>

<p>"Cheer oh!" said Bones.</p>

<p>"What are you saying&mdash;will he let us go?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"I was sayin' what a jolly row there'll be," lied Bones; "and he
was sayin' that he couldn't think of hurtin' a charmin' lady like
you. Shut your eyes, dear old Miss Hamilton."</p>

<p>She shut them quickly, half fainting with terror, for Bucongo
was coming towards them, a blazing iron in his hand, a smile of
simple benevolence upon his not unintelligent face.</p>

<p>"This shall come as a blessing to you, Tibbetti," he said almost
jovially.</p>

<p>Bones shut his teeth and waited.</p>

<p>The hot iron was scorching his silk shirt when a voice hailed
the high-priest of the newest of cults.</p>

<p>"O Bucongo," it said.</p>

<p>Bucongo turned with a grimace of fear and cringed backward
before the levelled Colt of Mr. Commissioner Sanders.</p>

<p>"Tell me now," said Sanders in his even tone, "can such a man as
you die? Think, Bucongo."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Bucongo huskily, "I think I can die."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Sanders.</p>

<p>It was not until after dinner that night that the girl had
recovered sufficiently to discuss her exciting morning.</p>

<p>"I think you were an awful brute," she addressed her unabashed
brother. "You were standing in the wood listening to and seeing
everything, and never came till the last minute."</p>

<p>"It was my fault," interrupted Sanders. "I wanted to see how far
the gentle Bucongo would go."</p>

<p>"Dooced thoughtless," murmured Bones under his breath, but
audible.</p>

<p>She looked at him long and earnestly then turned again to her
brother,</p>

<p>"There is one thing I want to know," she said. "What was Bones
saying when he talked to that horrible man? Do you know that Bones
was scowling at me as though I was... I hardly know how to express
it. Was he saying nice things?"</p>

<p>Hamilton looked up at the awning, and cleared his throat. "Play
the game, dear old sir and brother-officer," croaked Bones.</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;" began Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Live and let live," pleaded Bones, all of a twitter. "<i>Esprit
de corps</i> an' discretion, jolly old captain."</p>

<p>Hamilton looked at his subordinate steadily. "He asked to be
branded twice in order that you might not be branded once," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>The girl stared at Bones, and her eyes were full of tears. "Oh,
Bones!" she said, with a little catch in her voice, "you... you are
a sportsman."</p>

<p>"Carry on," said Bones incoherently, and wept a little at the
realization of that magnificent moment.</p>

STORMS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 44, Aug
1916, pp 259-266</h3>

<p class="first">EVERYBODY knows that water drawn from rivers is
very bad water, for the rivers are the Roads of the Dead, and in
the middle of those nights when the merest rind of a moon shows,
and this sliver of light and two watchful stars form a triangle
pointing to the earth, the spirits rise from their graves and walk,
"singing deadly songs," towards the lower star which is the source
of all rivers. If you should be&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;on one
of these lonely island graveyards on such nights you will see
strange sights.</p>

<p>The broken cooking pots which rest on the mounds and the rent
linen which flutters from little sticks stuck about the graves,
grow whole and new again. The pots are red and hot as they come
from the fire, and the pitiful cloths take on the sheen of youth
and fold themselves about invisible forms. None may see the dead,
though it is said that you may see the babies.</p>

<p>These the wise men have watched playing at the water's edge,
crowing and chuckling in the universal language of their kind,
staggering groggily along the shelving beach with outspread arms
balancing their uncertain steps. On such nights when M'sa beckons
the dead world to the source of all rivers, the middle islands are
crowded with babies&mdash;the dead babies of a thousand years.
Their spirits come up from the unfathomed deeps of the great river
and call their mortality from the graves.</p>

<p>"How may the waters of the river be acceptable?" asks the
shuddering N'gombi mother.</p>

<p>Therefore the N'gombi gather their water from the skies in
strange cisterns of wicker, lined with the leaf of a certain plant
which is impervious, and even carry their drinking supplies with
them when they visit the river itself.</p>

<p>There was a certain month in the year, which will be remembered
by all who attempted the crossing of the Kasai Forest to the south
of the N'gombi country, when pools and rivulets suddenly
dried&mdash;so suddenly, indeed, that even the crocodiles, who have
an instinct for coming drought, were left high and dry, in some
cases miles from the nearest water, and when the sun rose in a sky
unflecked by cloud and gave place at nights to a sky so brilliant
and so menacing in their fierce and fiery nearness that men went
mad.</p>

<p>Toward the end of this month, when an exasperating full moon
advertised a continuance of the dry spell by its very whiteness,
the Chief Koosoogolaba-Muchini, or, as he was called, Muchini,
summoned a council of his elder men, and they came with parched
throats and fear of death.</p>

<p>"All men know," said Muchini, "what sorrow has come to us, for
there is a more powerful ju-ju in the land than I remember. He has
made M'shimba M'Shamba afraid so that he has gone away and walks no
more in the forest with his terrible lightning. Also K'li, the
father of pools, has gone into the earth and all his little
children, and I think we shall die, every one of us."</p>

<p>There was a skinny old man, with a frame like a dried goatskin,
who made a shuffling noise when he spoke.</p>

<p>"O Muchini," he said, "when I was a young man there was a way to
bring M'shimba M'shamba which was most wonderful. In those days we
took a young maiden and hung her upon a tree&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those old ways were good," interrupted Muchini; "but I tell you
M'bonia, that we can follow no more the old ways since Sandi came
to the land, for he is a cruel man and hanged my own mother's
brother for that fine way of yours. Yet we cannot sit and die
because of certain magic which the Stone Breaker is
practising."</p>

<p>Now Bula Matadi ("The Stone Breaker") was in those days the
mortal enemy of the N'gombi people, who were wont to ascribe all
their misfortunes to his machinations. To Bula Mutadi (which was
the generic name by which the Government of the Congo Free State
was known) was traceable the malign perversity of game, the blight
of crops, the depredations of weaver birds. Bula Matadi encouraged
leopards to attack isolated travellers, and would on great
occasions change the seasons of the year that the N'gombi's gardens
might come to ruin.</p>

<p>"It is known from one end of the earth to the other that I am a
most cunning man," Muchini went on, stroking his muscular arm, a
trick of self-satisfied men in their moments of complacence; "and
whilst even the old men slept, I, Koosoogolaba-Muchini, the son of
the terrible and crafty G'sombo, the brother of Eleni-N'gombi, I
went abroad with my wise men and my spies and sought out devils and
ghosts in places where even the bravest have never been," he
lowered his voice to a horse whisper, "to the Ewa-Ewa Mongo, the
Very Place of Death."</p>

<p>The gasp of horror from his audience was very satisfying to this
little chief of the Inner N'gombi, and here was a moment suitable
for his climax.</p>

<p>"And behold!" he cried.</p>

<p>By his side was something covered with a piece of native cloth.
This covering he removed with a flourish and revealed a small
yellow box.</p>

<p>It was most certainly no native manufacture, for its angles were
clamped with neat brass corner-pieces set flush in the polished
wood.</p>

<p>The squatting councillors watched their lord as with easy
familiarity he opened the lid.</p>

<p>There were twenty tiny compartments, and in each was a slender
glass tube, corked and heavily sealed, whilst about the neck of
each tube was a small white label covered with certain devil
marks.</p>

<p>Muchini waited until the sensation he had prepared had had its
full effect.</p>

<p>"By the Great River* which runs to the Allamdani," he said
slowly and impressively, "were white men who had been sent by Bula
Matadi to catch ghosts. For I saw them, I and my wise men, when the
moon was calling all spirits. They were gathered by the river with
little nets and little gourds and they caught the waters. Also they
caught little flies and other foolish things and took them to their
tent. Then my young men and I waited, and when all were gone away
we went to their tents and found this magic box&mdash;which is full
of devils and great power&mdash;Ro!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This was evidently the Sanga River]</p>

<p>He leapt to his feet, his eye gleaming. Across the starry dome
of the sky there had flicked a quick flare of light.</p>

<p>There came a sudden uneasy stirring of leaves, a hushed whisper
of things as though the forest had been suddenly awakened from
sleep.</p>

<p>Then an icy cold breeze smote his cheek, and staring upward, he
saw the western stars disappearing in swathes behind the tumbling
clouds.</p>

<p>"M'shimba M'shamba&mdash;he lives!" he roared, and the crash of
thunder in the forest answered him.</p>

<p>Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori, was on the furthermost edge of the
forest, for he was following the impulse of his simple nature and
was hunting in a country where he had no right to be. The storm
(which he cursed, having no scruples about river and water, and
being wholly sceptical as to ghosts) broke with all its fury over
his camp and passed. Two nights later, he sat before the rough hut
his men had built, discussing the strange ways of the antelope,
when he suddenly stopped and listened, lowering his head till it
almost touched the ground.</p>

<p>Clear to his keen ears came the rattle of the distant
lokali&mdash;the drum that sends messages from village to village
and from nation to nation.</p>

<p>"O Secundi," said Bosambo, with a note of seriousness in his
voice, "I have not heard that call for many moons&mdash;for it is
the war call of the N'gombi."</p>

<p>"Lord, it is no war call," said the old man, shifting his feet
for greater comfort, "yet it is a call which may mean war, for it
calls spears to a dance, and it is strange, for the N'gombi have no
enemies."</p>

<p>"All men are the enemies of the N'gombi," Bosambo quoted a river
saying as old as the sun.</p>

<p>He listened again, and rose.</p>

<p>"You shall go back and gather me a village of spears, and bring
them to the borderland near the road that crosses the river," he
said.</p>

<p>"On my life," said the other.</p>

<p>Muchini, Chief of the Inner N'gombi, a most inflated man and a
familiar of magical spirits, gathered his spears to some purpose,
for two days later Bosambo met him by his border and the chiefs
greeted one another between two small armies.</p>

<p>"Which way do you go, Muchini?" asked Bosambo.</p>

<p>Now, between Muchini and the Chief of the Ochori was a grievance
dating back to the big war, when Bosambo had slain the N'gombi
chief of the time with his own hands.</p>

<p>"I go to the river to call a palaver of all free men," said
Muchini; "for I tell you this, Bosambo, that I have found a great
magic which will make us greater than Sandi, and it has been
prophesied that I shall be king over a thousand times a thousand
spears. For I have a small box which brings even M'shimba to my
call."</p>

<p>Bosambo, a head and shoulders taller than the other, waved his
hand towards the forest path which leads eventually to the Ochori
city.</p>

<p>"Here is a fine moment for you, Muchini," he said, "and you
shall try your great magic on me and upon my young men. For I say
that you do not go by this way, neither you nor your warriors,
since I am the servant of Sandi and of his King, and he has sent me
here to keep his peace; go back to your village, for this is the
way to Death."</p>

<p>Muchini glared at his enemy.</p>

<p>"Yet this way I go, Bosambo," he said huskily, and looked over
his shoulder towards his followers.</p>

<p>Bosambo swung round on one heel, an arm and a leg outstretched
in the attitude of an athlete who is putting the shot. Muchini
threw up his wicker shield and pulled back his stabbing spear, but
he was a dead man before the weapon was poised.</p>

<p>Thus ended the war, and the N'gombi folk went home, never so
much as striking a blow for the yellow box which Bosambo claimed
for himself as his own personal loot.</p>

<p>At the time, Mr. Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., was blissfully
ignorant of the miraculous happenings which have been recorded. He
was wholly preoccupied by the novelty which the presence of
Patricia Hamilton offered. Never before had a white woman made her
home at the Residency, and it changed things a little.</p>

<p>She was at times an embarrassment.</p>

<p>When Fubini, the witch-doctor of the Akasava, despatched five
maidens to change Sandi's wicked heart&mdash;Sanders had sent
Fubini to the Village of Irons for six months for preaching
unauthorized magic&mdash;they came, in the language of Bones,
"doocedly undressed," and Patricia had beaten a hurried
retreat.</p>

<p>She was sometimes an anxiety, as I have already shown, but was
never a nuisance. She brought to headquarters an aroma of English
spring, a clean fragrance that refreshed the heat-jaded
Commissioner and her brother, but which had no perceptible
influence upon Bones.</p>

<p>That young officer called for her one hot morning, and Hamilton,
sprawling on a big cane chair drawn to the shadiest and breeziest
end of the verandah, observed that Bones carried a wooden box, a
drawing-board, a pad of paper, two pencils imperfectly concealed
behind his large ear, and a water-bottle.</p>

<p>"Shop!" said Hamilton lazily. "Forward, Mr. Bones!&mdash;what
can we do for you this morning?"</p>

<p>Bones shaded his eyes and peered into the cool corner. "Talkin'
in your sleep, dear old Commander," he said pleasantly, "dreamin'
of the dear old days beyond recall." He struck an attitude and
lifted his unmusical voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"When life was gay, heigho! Tum tum te tay, heigho! Oh, tiddly
umpty humpty umpty do, When life was gay&mdash;dear old
officer&mdash;heigho!"</p>

<p>Patricia Hamilton stepped out to the verandah in alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, don't make that hooting noise," she appealed to her
brother. "I'm writing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said Hamilton, "it was only Bones singing. Do
it again, Bones, Pat didn't hear you."</p>

<p>Bones stood erect, his hand to his white helmet.</p>

<p>"Come aboard, my lady," he said.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you a minute, Bones," said the girl, and
disappeared &mdash;into the house.</p>

<p>"What are you doing this morning?" asked Hamilton, gazing with
pardonable curiosity at the box and drawing-board.</p>

<p>"Polishin' up my military studies with Miss Hamilton's kind
assistance&mdash;botany and applied science, sir," said Bones
briskly. "Field fortifications, judgin' distance, strategy, Bomongo
grammar, field cookery an' tropical medicines."</p>

<p>"What has poor little making-up-company-accounts done?" asked
Hamilton, and Bones blushed.</p>

<p>"Dear old officer," he begged, "I'll tackle that little job as
soon as I get back. I tried to do 'em this mornin' an' I was four
dollars out &mdash;it's the regimental cash account that's wrong.
People come in and out helpin' themselves, and I positively can't
keep track of the money."</p>

<p>"As I'm the only person with the key of the regimental cash-box,
I suppose you mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Bones raised his hand.</p>

<p>"I make no accusations, dear old feller&mdash;it's a painful
subject. We all have those jolly old moments of temptation. I
tackle the accounts to-night, sir. You mustn't forget that I've a
temperament. I'm not like you dear old wooden-heads&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," said the weary Hamilton. "So long as you're going
to do a bit of study, it's all right."</p>

<p>"Now, Bones," said Patricia, appearing on the scene, "have you
got the sandwiches?"</p>

<p>Bones made terrifying and warning grimaces.</p>

<p>"Have you got the board to lay the cloth and the paper to cover
it, and the chocolates and the cold tea?"</p>

<p>Bones frowned, and jerked his head in an agony of warning.</p>

<p>"Come on, then," said the unconscious betrayer of Lieutenant
Tibbetts. "Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>"Why 'good-bye,' dear old Hamilton's sister?" asked Bones.</p>

<p>She looked at him scornfully and led the way.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the field fortifications," called Hamilton after
him; "they eat nicely between slices of strategy."</p>

<p>The sun was casting long shadows eastward when they returned.
They had not far to come, for the place they had chosen for their
picnic was well within the Residency reservation, but Bones had
been describing on his way back one of the remarkable powers he
possessed, namely, his ability to drag the truth from reluctant and
culpable natives. And every time he desired to emphasize the point
he would stop, lower all his impedimenta to the ground, cluttering
up the landscape with picnic-box, drawing-board, sketching-blocks
and the numerous bunches of wild flowers he had culled at her
request, and press his argument with much palm-punching.</p>

<p>He stopped for the last time on the very edge of the barrack
square, put down his cargo and proceeded to demolish the doubt she
had unwarily expressed.</p>

<p>"That's where you've got an altogether erroneous view of me,
dear old sister," he said triumphantly. "I'm known up and down the
river as the one man that you can't deceive. Go up and ask the
Bomongo, drop in on the Isisi, speak to the Akasava, an' what will
they say? They'll say, 'No, ma'am, there's no flies on jolly old
Bones&mdash;not on your life, Harriet!'"</p>

<p>"Then they would be very impertinent," smiled Pat.</p>

<p>"Ask Sanders (God bless him!). Ask Ham. Ask&mdash;" he was going
on enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Are you going to camp here, or are you coming in?" she
challenged.</p>

<p>Bones gathered up his belongings, never ceasing to talk.</p>

<p>"Fellers like me, dear young friend, make the Empire&mdash;paint
the whole bally thing red, white and blue&mdash;'unhonoured and
unsung, until the curtain's rung, the boys that made the Empire and
the Navy.'"</p>

<p>"Bones, you promised you wouldn't sing," she said reproachfully;
"and, besides, you're not in the navy."</p>

<p>"That doesn't affect the argument," protested Bones, and was
rapidly shedding his equipment in preparation for another
discourse, when she walked on towards Sanders who had come across
the square to meet them.</p>

<p>Bones made a dive at the articles he had dropped, and came
prancing (no other word describes his erratic run) up to
Sanders.</p>

<p>"I've just been telling Miss Hamilton, sir and Excellency, that
nobody can find things that old Bones&mdash;you'll remember, sir
the episode of your lost pyjama legs. Who found 'em?"</p>

<p>"You did," said Sanders; "they were sent home in your washing.
Talking about finding things, read this."</p>

<p>He handed a telegraph form to the young man, and Bones, peering
into the message until his nose almost touched the paper,
read&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"VERY URGENT. CLEAR THE LINE. ADMINISTRATION.
TO SANDERS, COMMISSION RIVER TERRITORIES. MESSAGE BEGINS. BELGIAN
CONGO GOVERNMENT REPORTS FROM LEOPOLDVILLE, BACTERIOLOGICAL
EXPEDITION CARRIERS RAIDED ON EDGE OF YOUR TERRITORY BY INNER
N'GOMBI PEOPLE, ALL STORES LOOTED INCLUDING CASE OF 20 CULTURE
TUBES. STOP. AS ALL THESE CULTURES ARE OF VIRULENT DISEASES,
INOCULATE INNER N'GOMBI UNTIL INTACT TUBES RECOVERED. MESSAGE
ENDS."</p>
<br>

<p>Bones read it twice, and his face took on an appearance which
indicated something between great pain and intense vacancy. It was
intended to convey to the observer the fact that Bones was thinking
deeply and rapidly, and that he had banished from his mind all the
frivolities of life.</p>

<p>"I understand, sir&mdash;you wish me to go to the dear old Congo
Government and apologize&mdash;I shall be ready in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"What I really want you to do," said Sanders patiently, "is to
take the Wiggle up stream and get that box."</p>

<p>"I quite understand, sir," said Bones, nodding his head. "To-day
is the 8th, to-morrow is the 9th&mdash;the box shall be in your
hands on the i5th by half-past seven in the evening, dear old
sir."</p>

<p>He saluted and turned a baleful glare upon the girl, the import
of which she was to learn at first hand.</p>

<p>"Duty, Miss Patricia Hamilton! Forgive poor old Bones if he
suddenly drops the mask of <i>dolce far niente</i>&mdash;I go!"</p>

<p>He saluted again and went marching stiffly to his quarters with
all the dignity which an empty lunch-box and a dangling
water-bottle would allow him.</p>

<p>The next morning Bones went forth importantly for the Ochori
city, being entrusted with the task of holding, so to speak, the
right flank of the N'gombi country.</p>

<p>"You will use your discretion," Sanders said at parting, "and,
of course, you must keep your eyes open; if you hear the merest
hint that the box is in your neighbourhood, get it."</p>

<p>"I think, your Excellency," said Bones, with heavy carelessness,
"that I have fulfilled missions quite as delicate as this, and as
for observation, why, the gift runs in my family."</p>

<p>"And runs so fast that you've never caught up with it," growled
Hamilton.</p>

<p>Bones turned haughtily and saluted. It was a salute full of
subdued offence.</p>

<p>He went joyously to the northward, evolving cunning plans. He
stopped at every village to make inquiries and to put the
unoffending villagers to considerable trouble&mdash;for he insisted
upon a house-to-house search&mdash;before, somewhat wearied by his
own zeal, he came to the Ochori.</p>

<p>Chief Bosambo heard of his coming and summoned his
councillors.</p>

<p>"Truly has Sandi a hundred ears," he said in dismay, "for it
seems that he has heard of the slaying of Muchini. Now, all men who
are true to me will swear to the lord Tibbetti that we know nothing
of a killing palaver, and that we have not been beyond the trees to
the land side of the city. This you will say because you love me;
and if any man says another thing I will beat him until he is
sick."</p>

<p>Bones came and was greeted by the chief, and Bosambo was carried
to the beach on a litter.</p>

<p>"Lord," said Bosambo weakly, "now the sight of your simple face
will make me a well man again. For, lord, I have not left my bed
since the coming of the rains, and there is strength neither in my
hands and feet."</p>

<p>"Poor old bird," said Bones sympathetically, "you've been
sittin' in a draught."</p>

<p>"This I tell you, Tibbetti," Bosambo went on, as yet uncertain
of his ruler's attitude, since Bones must need, at this critical
moment, employ English and idiomatic English, "that since the last
moon was young I have lain in my hut never moving, seeing nothing
and hearing nothing, being like a dead man&mdash;all this my
headman will testify."</p>

<p>Bones's face dropped, for he had hoped to secure information
here. Bosambo, watching his face through half-closed lids, saw the
dismal droop of the other's mouth, and came to the conclusion that
whatever might be the cause of the visit, it was not to hold the
Ochori or their chief to account for known misdeeds.</p>

<p>"O Bosambo," said Bones, in the river dialect, "this is sad
news, for I desire that you shall tell me certain things for which
Sandi would have given you salt and rods."</p>

<p>The Chief of the Ochori sat up in his litter and went so far as
to put one foot to the ground.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said heartily, "the sound of your lovely voice brings
me from the grave and gives me strength. Ask, O Bonesi, for you are
my father and my mother; and though I saw and heard nothing, yet in
my sickness I had wonderful visions and all things were made
visible&mdash;that I declare to you, Bonesi, before all men."</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'Bonesi,'" said Bones fiercely. "You're a jolly
cheeky feller, Bosambo&mdash;you're very, very naughty,
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Master," said Bosambo humbly, " though I rule these Ochori I am
a foreigner in this land; in the tongue of my own people, Bonesi
means 'he -who-is-noble-in-face-and-a-giver-of-justice'."</p>

<p>"That's better," nodded the gratified Bones, and went on
speaking in the dialect. "You shall help me in this&mdash;it
touches on the people of the Inner N'gombi&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bosambo fell back wearily on to the litter, and rolled his eyes
as one in pain.</p>

<p>"This is a sorrow for me. Bo-Tibbetti," he said faintly, "but I
am a sick man."</p>

<p>"Also," continued Bones, "of a certain box of wood, full of
poisons&mdash;"</p>

<p>As well as he could Bones explained the peculiar properties of
germ culture.</p>

<p>"Oh, ko!" said Bosambo, closing his eyes, and was to all
appearances beyond human aid.</p>

<p>"Lord," said Bosambo, at parting, "you have brought me to life,
and every man of every tribe shall know that you are a great
healer. To all the far and quiet places of the forest I will send
my young men who will cry you aloud as a most wonderful
doctor."</p>

<p>"Not at all," murmured Bones modestly, "not at all."</p>

<p>"Master," said Bosambo, this time in English, for he was not to
be outdone in the matter of languages, for had he not attended a
great mission school in Monrovia? "Master, you dam' fine feller,
you look 'um better feller, you no find um. You be same like Moses
and Judi Escariot, big fine feller, by golly&mdash;yas."</p>

<p>All night long, between the visits which Bones had been making
from the moored Wiggle to the village (feeling the patient's pulse
with a profound and professional air and prescribing brandy and
milk), Bosambo had been busy.</p>

<p>"Stand you at the door, Secundi," he said to his headman, "and
let one of your men go to the shore to warn me of my lord
Tibbetti's coming, for I have work to do. It seems this Maker of
Storms were better with Sandi than with me."</p>

<p>"Tibbetti is a fool, I think," suggested Secundi.</p>

<p>Bosambo, kneeling on a rush mat, busy with a native chisel and a
pot of clay paint, looked up.</p>

<p>"I have beaten older men than you with a stick until they have
wept," he said, "and all for less than you say. For this is the
truth, Secundi, that a child cannot be a fool, though an old man
may be a shame. This is the word of the blessed prophet. As for
Tibbetti, he has a clean and loving heart."</p>

<p>There was a rustle at the door and a whispered voice.</p>

<p>The box and the tools were thrust under a skin rug and Bosambo
again became the interesting invalid.</p>

<p>In the morning Bosambo had said farewell, and a blushing Bones
listened with unconcealed pleasure to the extravagant praise of his
patient.</p>

<p>"And this I tell you, Tibbetti," said Bosambo, standing
thigh-deep in the river by the launch's side, "that knowing you are
wise man who gathers wisdom, I have sent to the end of my country
for some rare and beautiful thing that you may carry it with
you."</p>

<p>He signalled to a man on the bank, and his servant brought him a
curious object.</p>

<p>It was, Bones noted, a square box apparently of native make, for
it was fantastically carved and painted. There were crude heads and
hideous forms which were never on land or sea. The paint was
brilliant; red, yellow and green indiscriminately splashed.</p>

<p>"This is very ancient and was brought to my country by certain
forest people. It is a Maker of Storms, and is a powerful ju-ju for
good and evil."</p>

<p>Bones, already a collector of native work, was delighted. His
delight soothed him for his failure in other respects.</p>

<p>He returned to headquarters empty-handed and sat the centre of a
chilling group&mdash;if we except Patricia Hamilton&mdash;and
endeavoured, as so many successful advocates have done, to hide his
shortcomings behind a screen of rhetoric.</p>

<p>He came to the part in his narrative where Bosambo was taken ill
without creating any notable sensation, save that Sanders's grey
eyes narrowed a little and he paid greater heed to the rest of the
story.</p>

<p>"There was poor old Bosambo knocked out, sir&mdash;ab-so-lutely
done for&mdash;fortunately I did not lose my nerve. You know what I
am, dear old officer, in moments of crisis?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Hamilton grimly, "something between a Welsh
revivalist and a dancing dervish."</p>

<p>"Please go on, Bones," begged the girl, not the least interested
of the audience.</p>

<p>"I dashed straight back to the Wiggle," said Bones breathlessly,
"searched for my medicine chest&mdash;it wasn't there! Not so much
as a mustard plaster&mdash;what was I to do, dear old Miss
Hamilton?" he appealed dramatically.</p>

<p>"Don't tell him, Pat," begged Hamilton, "he's sure to guess
it."</p>

<p>"What was I to do? I seized a bottle of brandy," said Bones with
relish, "I dashed back to where Bosambo was lyin', I dashed into
the village, into his hut and got a glass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Sanders impatiently, "what happened after all
this dashing?"</p>

<p>Bones spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"Bosambo is alive to-day," he said simply, "praisin'&mdash;if I
may be allowed to boast&mdash;the name of Bones the Medicine Man.
Look here, sir."</p>

<p>He dragged towards him along the floor of the hut a package
covered with a piece of native sacking. This he whisked away and
revealed the hideous handiwork of an artist who had carved and
painted as true to nature as a man may who is not quite certain
whether the human eye is half-way down the nose or merely an
appendage to his ear.</p>

<p>"That, sir," said Bones impressively, "is one of the most
interestin' specimens of native work I have ever seen: a gift! From
Bosambo to the jolly old doctor man who dragged him, if I might so
express it, from the very maws of death."</p>

<p>He made his dramatic pause.</p>

<p>Sanders bent down, took a penknife from his pocket and scraped
the paint from a flat oblong space on the top.</p>

<p>There for all men to see&mdash;save Bones who was now engaged in
a relation of his further adventure to his one
sympathizer&mdash;was a brass plate, and when the paint had been
scraped away, an inscription &mdash;"Dpartment de Mdicine, tat
CONGO BELGE."</p>

<p>Sanders and Hamilton gazed, fascinated and paralysed to
silence.</p>

<p>"I've always had a feelin' I'd like to be a medicine man," Bones
prattled on. "You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, Bones," interrupted Sanders quietly. "Did you open
this box by any chance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bones.</p>

<p>"And did you see any of its contents?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bones confidentially, "that's the most
interestin' thing about the box. It contains magic&mdash;which, of
course, honoured sir and Excellency, is all rubbish."</p>

<p>Sanders took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and after a few
trials opened the case and scrutinized the contents, noting the
comforting fact that all the tubes were sealed. He heaved a deep
sigh of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"You didn't by chance discover anything about the missing
cultures, Bones?" he asked mildly.</p>

<br>

<p>Bones shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and looked
disconsolately at his chief.</p>

<p>"You think I've been feeble, but I haven't lost hope, sir," he
said, with fine resolution. "I've got a feelin' that if I were
allowed to go into the forest, disguised, sir, as a sort of
half-witted native chap, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disguised!" said Hamilton, "Good Lord, what do you want a
disguise for?"</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04">IV. &mdash; BONES AND THE
WIRELESS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 44, Sep
1916, 391-398</h3>

<p class="first">KO-BORU, the headman of Bingini, called his
relations together for a solemn family conference.</p>

<p>The lower river folk play an inconsiderable role in the politics
of the Territories, partly because they are so near to headquarters
that there is no opportunity for any of those secret preparations
which precede all native intrigues, great or small, and partly
because the lower river people are so far removed from the
turbulent elements of the upper river that they are not swayed by
the cyclonic emotions of the Isisi, the cold and deliberate desire
for slaughter which is characteriatically Akasavian, or the
electrical decisions of the Outer N'gombi.</p>

<p>But they had their crises.</p>

<p>To Bingini came all the notables of the district who claimed
kinship with Ko-buru, and they sat in a great circle about the
headman's hut, alternately eyeing the old headman and their stout
relative, his daughter.</p>

<p>"All my relations shall know this," began Ko-boru, after Okmimi,
the witch-doctor, had formally burnt away the devils and ghosts
that fringe all large assemblies, "that a great shame has come to
us, every one, because of Yoka-m'furi. For this Yoka is to Sandi as
a brother, and guides his little ship up and down the river, and
because of this splendid position I gave him my own daughter by the
first of my wives."</p>

<p>"S'm-m!" murmured the council in agreement.</p>

<p>"Also I built him a hut and gave him a garden, where his wife
might work, and he has sat at family palavers. Now, I tell you that
Yoka-m'furi is an evil man. for he has left my daughter, and has
found another wife in the upper river, and he comes no more to this
village, and my daughter weeps all day.</p>

<p>"For three seasons he has not been to this village; when the
moon comes again, it will be four." He said this with proper
significance, and the flat face of the melancholy girl by his side
puckered and creased miserably before she opened her large mouth to
wail her woe.</p>

<p>For the man who deliberately separates himself from his wife for
four seasons and does not spend twenty-four hours&mdash;"from
sunrise to moonset" in her village is automatically divorced and
freed from all responsibility. This is the custom of all people
from the lands of the Great King to the sea.</p>

<p>"Now, I have had a dream," Ko-boru went on, " and in this dream
it was told me that I should call you all together, and that I and
the chief of my councillors and friends should go to Sandi and tell
him what is true."</p>

<p>"Brother and uncle," said Bechimi of G'lara, " I will go with
you, for once I spoke to Sandi and he spoke to me, and because of
his cunning memory he will recall Bechimi, who picked up his little
black stick, when it fell, and gave it to him."</p>

<p>Five were chosen to accompany Ko-boru, and they took canoe and
travelled for less than five miles to the Residency.</p>

<p>Sanders was entertaining Patricia Hamilton with stories of
native feuds, when the unexpected deputation squatted in the sun
before the verandah.</p>

<p>"O Ko-boru," hailed Sanders, "why do you come?"</p>

<p>Ko-boru was all for a long and impressive palaver, but
recognized a certain absence of encouragement in the Commissioner's
tone. Therefore he came straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Now, you are our father and our mother, Sandi," he said, in
conclusion, "and when you speak, all wonders happen. Also you have
very beautiful friends, Militini, who speak a word and set his
terrible soldiers moving like leopards towards a kill, and
Tibbetti, the young one who is innocent and simple. So I say to
you, Sandi, that if you speak one word to Yoka, he will come back
to my daughter, his wife."</p>

<p>Sanders stood by the rail of the stoep and looked down upon the
spokesman.</p>

<p>"I hear strange things, Ko-boru," he said quietly. "They tell me
stories of a woman with many lovers and an evil tongue; and once
there came to me Yoka with a wounded head, for this daughter of
yours is very quick in her anger."</p>

<p>"Lord," said the flustered Ko-boru, "such things happen even in
love."</p>

<p>"All things happen in love," said Sanders, with a little smile,
"and, if it is to be, Yoka will return. Also, if it is to be, he
will not go back to the woman, and she will be free. This palaver
is finished."</p>

<p>"Lord," pleaded Ko-buru, "the woman will do no more angry
things. Let him come back from sunrise to moon-set&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This palaver is finished," repeated Sanders.</p>

<p>On the way back to Bingini the relatives of Ko-boru made a plot.
It was the first plot that had been hatched in the shadow of
headquarters for twenty years.</p>

<p>"Would it be indiscreet to ask what your visitors wanted?" asked
the girl, as the crestfallen deputation was crossing the square to
their canoe.</p>

<p>"It was a marriage palaver," replied Sanders, with a little
grimace, "and I was being requested to restore a husband to a
temperamental lady who has a passion for shying cook-pots at her
husband when she is annoyed."</p>

<p>The girl's laughing eyes were fixed upon his.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Sanders!" she said, with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry for me," smiled Sanders. "I'm rather domestic
really, and I'm interested in this case because the man concerned
is my steersman&mdash;the best on the river, and a capital
all-round man. Besides that," he went on seriously, "I regard them
all as children of mine. It is right that a man who shirks his
individual responsibilities to the race should find a family to
'father'."</p>

<p>"Why do you?" she asked, after a little pause.</p>

<p>"Why do I what?"</p>

<p>"Shirk your responsibilities," she said. "This is a healthy and
delightful spot: a woman might be very happy here."</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've been awfully impertinent," said Patricia,
hurriedly rising, "but to a woman there is a note of interrogation
behind every bachelor&mdash;especially nice bachelors&mdash;and the
more 'confirmed' he is, the bigger the question mark."</p>

<p>Sanders rose to her.</p>

<p>"One of these days I shall do something rash," he threatened
with that shy laugh of his. "Here is your little family
coming."</p>

<p>Bones and Hamilton were discussing something heatedly, and
justice was on the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts, if one could judge
by the frequency with which he stopped and gesticulated.</p>

<p>"It really is too bad," said the annoyed Hamilton, as he mounted
the steps to the stoep, followed by Bones, who, to do him justice,
did not adopt the attitude of a delinquent, but was, on the
contrary, injured virtue personified.</p>

<p>"What is too bad, dear?" asked the girl sympathetically.</p>

<p>"A fortnight ago," said Hamilton, "I told this silly
ass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your jolly old brother is referrin' to me, dear lady,"
explained Bones.</p>

<p>"Who else could I be referring to?" demanded the other
truculently. "I told him to have all the company accounts ready by
to-morrow. You know, sir, that the paymaster is coming down from
Administration to check 'em, and will you believe me, sir"&mdash;he
glared at Bones, who immediately closed his eyes
resignedly&mdash;"would you believe me that, when I went to examine
those infernal accounts, they were all at sixes and sevens?"</p>

<p>"Threes an' nines, dear old officer," murmured Bones, waking up,
"the matter in dispute being a trifle of thirty-nine dollars, which
I have generously offered to make up out of my own pocket."</p>

<p>He beamed round as one who expected applause.</p>

<p>"And on top of this," fumed Hamilton, "he talks of taking Pat
for an early morning picnic to the village island!"</p>

<p>"Accompanied by the jolly old accounts," corrected Bones. "Do me
justice, sir and brother-officer. I offered to take the books with
me, an' render a lucid and convincin' account of my
stewardship."</p>

<p>"Don't make me laugh," snarled Hamilton, stamping into the
bungalow.</p>

<p>"Isn't he naughty?" said Bones admiringly.</p>

<p>"Now, Bones," warned the girl, "I shan't go unless you keep your
word with Alec."</p>

<p>Bones drew himself up and saluted.</p>

<p>"Dear old friend," he said proudly, "put your faith in
Bones."</p>

<p>"H.M. Launch No. 36 (Territories)," as it was officially
described on the stores record, had another name, which she earned
in her early days through certain eccentricities of construction.
Though she might not in justice be called the Wiggle any longer,
yet the Wiggle she was from one end of the river to the other, and
even native men called her "Komfuru," which means " that which does
not run straight."</p>

<p>It had come to be recognized that the Wiggle was the especial
charge of Lieutenant Tibbetts. Bones himself was the first to
recognize this right. There were moments when he inferred that the
Wiggle's arrival on the station at the time he was making his own
first appearance was something more than a coincidence.</p>

<p>She was not, in the strictest sense of the word, a launch, for
she possessed a square, open dining-saloon and two tiny cabins
amidships. Her internal works were open to the light of day, and
her engineer lived in the engine-room up to his waist and on deck
from his waist up, thus demonstrating the possibility of being in
two places at once.</p>

<p>The Wiggle, moreover, possessed many attributes which are denied
to other small steamers. She had, for example, a Maxim gun on her
tiny forecastle. She had a siren of unusual power and diabolical
tone, she was also fitted with a big motor-horn, both of which
appendages were Bones's gift to his flagship. The motor-horn may
seem superfluous, but when the matter is properly explained, you
will understand the necessity for some less drastic method of
self-advertisement than the siren.</p>

<p>The first time the siren had been fitted Bones had taken the
Wiggle through "the Channel." Here the river narrows and deepens,
and the current runs at anything from five to seven knots an hour.
Bones was going up stream, and met the Bolalo Mission steamer
coming down. She had dipped her flag to the Wiggle's blue ensign,
and Bones had replied with two terrific blasts on his siren.</p>

<p>After that the Wiggle went backwards, floating with the current
all ways, from broadside on to stern first, for in those two blasts
Bones had exhausted the whole of his steam reserve.</p>

<p>She was also equipped with wireless. There was an "aerial" and
an apparatus which Bones had imported from England at a cost of
twelve pounds, and which was warranted to receive messages from two
hundred miles distant. There was also a book of instructions. Bones
went to his hut with the book and read it. His servant found him in
bed the next morning, sleeping like a child, with his hand resting
lightly upon the second page.</p>

<p>Sanders and Hamilton both took a hand at fixing the Wiggle's
wireless. The only thing they were all quite certain about was that
there ought to be a wire somewhere. So they stretched the aerial
from the funnel to the flagstaff at the stern of the boat, and then
addressed themselves to the less simple solution of "making it
work."</p>

<p>They tried it for a week, and gave it up in despair.</p>

<p>"They've had you, Bones," said Hamilton. "It doesn't 'went.'
Poor old Bones!"</p>

<p>"Your pity, dear old officer, is offensive," said Bones stiffly,
"an' I don't mind tellin' you that I've a queer feelin'&mdash;I
can't explain what it is, except that I'm a dooce of a
psychic&mdash;that that machine is goin' to be jolly useful."</p>

<p>But though Bones worked day and night, read the book of
instructions from cover to cover, and took the whole apparatus to
pieces, examining each part under a strong magnifying glass, he
never succeeded either in transmitting or receiving a message, and
the machine was repacked and stored in the spare cabin, and was
never by any chance referred to, except by Hamilton in his most
unpleasant moments.</p>

<p>Bones took an especial delight in the Wiggle; it was his very
own ship, and he gave her his best personal attention. It was Bones
who ordered from London especially engraved notepaper headed
"H.M.S. Komfuru"&mdash;the native name sounded more important than
Wiggle, and more important than "Launch 36." It was Bones who
installed the little dynamo which&mdash;when it worked&mdash;lit
the cabins and even supplied power for a miniature searchlight. It
was Bones who had her painted Service grey, and would have added
another funnel if Hamilton had not detected the attempted
aggrandizement. Bones claimed that she was dustproof, waterproof,
and torpedo-proof, and Hamilton had voiced his regret that she was
not also fool-proof.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the next morning, when the world was all big hot
stars and shadows, and there was no sound but the whisper of the
running river and the "ha-a-a-a-ha-a-a-a" of breakers, Bones came
from his hut, crossed the parade-ground, and, making his way by the
light of a lantern along the concrete quay&mdash;it was the width
of an average table&mdash;dropped on to the deck and kicked the
custodian of the Wiggle to wakefulness.</p>

<p>Bones's satellite was one Ali Abid, who was variously described
as Moor, Egyptian, Tripolitan, and Bedouin, but was by all
ethnological indications a half-breed Kano, who had spent the
greater part of his life in the service of a professor of
bacteriology. This professor was something of a purist, and the
association with Ali Abid, plus a grounding in the elementary
subjects which are taught at St. Joseph's Mission School, Cape
Coast Castle, had given Ali a gravity of demeanour and a splendour
of vocabulary which many better favoured than he might have
envied.</p>

<p>"Arise," quoth Bones, in the cracked bass which he employed
whenever he felt called upon to deliver his inaccurate versions of
Oriental poets&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Arise, for morning in the bowl of night<br>
Has chucked a stone to put the stars to flight.<br>
And lo! and lo!...</p>

<p class="first">Get up, Ali, the caravan is moving. Oh make
haste!"</p>

<p>("Omar will never be dead so long as Bones quotes him," Hamilton
once said; "he simply couldn't afford to be dead and leave it to
Bones!")</p>

<p>Ali rose, blinking and shivering, for the early morning was very
cold, and he had been sleeping under an old padded dressing-gown
which Bones had donated.</p>

<p>"Muster all the hands," said Bones, setting his lantern on the
deck.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali slowly, "the subjects are not at our
disposition. Your preliminary instructions presupposed that you had
made necessary arrangements re personnel."</p>

<p>Bones scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Dash my whiskers," he said in his annoyance, "didn't I tell you
that I was taking the honourable lady for a trip? Didn't I tell
you, you jolly old slacker, to have everything ready by daybreak?
Didn't I issue explicit an' particular instructions about
grub?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, "you didn't."</p>

<p>"Then," said Bones wrathfully, "why the dickens do I think I
have?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, "some subjects, when enjoying refreshing coma,
possess delirium, hallucinations, highly imaginative, which
dissipate when the subject recovers consciousness, but retain in
brain cavity illusory reminiscences."</p>

<p>Bones thrust his face into the other's.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me I dreamt it?" he hissed.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, "self-preservation compels complete
acquiescence in your diagnosis."</p>

<p>"You're childish," said Bones.</p>

<p>He gave a few vague instructions in the best Bones manner, and
stole up to the dark Residency. He had solemnly promised Sanders
that he would rouse the girl without waking the rest of the
house.</p>

<p>They were to go up stream to the Village Island, where the
ironworkers of the Akasava had many curious implements to show her.
Breakfast was to be taken on the boat, and they were to return for
tiffin.</p>

<p>Overnight she had shown Bones the window of her room, and
Hamilton had offered to make a chalk mark on the sash, so there
could be no mistaking the situation of the room.</p>

<p>"If you wake me before sunrise, I shall do something I shall be
sorry for," he warned Bones. "If you return without straightening
the accounts, I shall do something which you will be sorry
for."</p>

<p>Bones remembered this as he crept stealthily along the wooden
verandah. To make doubly sure, he took off his boots and dropped
them with a crash.</p>

<p>"Sh!" said Bones loudly. "Sh, Bones! Not so much noise, you
silly old ass!"</p>

<p>He crept softly along the wooden wall and reconnoitred. The
middle window was Hamilton's room, the left was Sanders's, the
right was Patricia's. He went carefully to the right window and
knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Still no reply. He
knocked loudly.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Bones?" growled Sanders's voice.</p>

<p>Bones gasped.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, sir," he whispered agitatedly&mdash;"my mistake
entirely."</p>

<p>He tiptoed to the left window and rapped smartly. Then he
whistled, then he rapped again.</p>

<p>He heard a bed creak, and turned his head modestly away.</p>

<p>"It's Bones, dear old sister," he said, in his loudest whisper.
"Arise, for mornin' in the bowl of light has&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hamilton's voice raged at him.</p>

<p>"I knew it was you, you blithering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear old officer," began Bones, "awfully sorry! Go to sleep
again. Night-night!"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" said a muffled voice.</p>

<p>Bones, however, went to the middle window; here he could make no
mistake. He knocked authoritatively.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, ma'am," he said; "time is on the wing&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sash was flung up, and again Bones confronted the furious
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the exasperated Bones, "how the dooce did you get
here?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know this room has two madams? I told you last night,
you goop! Pat sleeps at the other end of the building. I told you
that, too, but you've got a brain like wool!"</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, sir," said Bones, on his dignity, "for the
information. I will not detain you."</p>

<p>Hamilton groped on his dressing-table for a hair-brush.</p>

<p>"Go back to bed, sir," said Bones, "an' don't forget to say your
prayers."</p>

<p>He was searching for the window in the other wing of the
Residency, when the girl, who had been up and dressed for a quarter
of an hour, came softly behind him and tapped him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wow!" screeched Bones. "Oh, Lord, dear old sister, you gave me
the dickens of a fright! Well, let's get along. Thank heavens, we
haven't disturbed anybody."</p>

<p>He was followed to the boat with the imprecations of two
pyjamaed figures that stood on the stoep and watched his lank body
melt in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Send us a wireless when you're coming back!" roared
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Cad!" said Bones, between his teeth.</p>

<p>Ali Abid had not been idle. He had aroused Yoka, the steersman,
and Boosoobi, the engineer, and these two men had accepted the
unexpected call with the curious readiness which natives show on
such occasions, and which suggests that they have pre-knowledge of
the summons, and are only waiting the word.</p>

<p>In one of the small cabins Ali had arranged the much-discussed
company accounts ready for his lord's attention, and there was
every promise of a happy and a profitable day when Yoka rang the
engines "ahead," and the Wiggle jerked her way to midstream.</p>

<p>The east had grown pale, there was a murmur from the dark
forests on either bank, the timorous chirping or bad-tempered
squawk of a bird, a faint fragrance of burning gum-wood from the
fishing villages established on the river bank, where, in dancing
spots of light, the women were tending to their fires.</p>

<p>There is no intermediate stage on the big river between darkness
and broad daylight. The stars go out all at once, and the inky sky
which serves them becomes a delicate blue. The shadows melt deeper
and deeper into the forest, clearly revealing the outlines of the
straight-stemmed trees. There is just this interregnum of pearl
greyness, a sort of hush-light, which lasts whilst a man counts
twenty, before the silver lances of the sun are flashing through
the leaves, and the grey veil which blurs the islands to shapeless
blotches in a river of dull silver is burnt to nothingness, and the
islands are living things of vivid green set in waters of gold.</p>

<p>"The sunrise!" said Bones, and waved his hand to the east with
the air of one who was responsible for the miracle.</p>

<p>The girl sat in a deep wicker chair and breathed in the glory
and freshness of the scene. Across the broad river, right ahead of
the boat, a flock of parroquets was flying, screeching their
raucous chorus. The sun caught their brilliant plumage, and she
saw, as it seemed, a rainbow in flight.</p>

<p>"Isn't that wonderful?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Bones peered up at the birds, shading his eyes.</p>

<p>"Just like a jolly old patchwork quilt," he said. "What a pity
they can't talk till you teach 'em! They're awful bad eatin', too,
though some fellers say they make a good curry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh look, look!"</p>

<p>The Wiggle was swerving to the southern bank of the river, and
two majestic flamingos standing at the water's edge had arrested
the girl's attention.</p>

<p>"They're bad eatin', too," said the informative Bones. "The
flesh is fishy an' too fat; heron are just the same."</p>

<p>"Haven't you a soul, Bones?" she asked severely.</p>

<p>"A soul, dear ma'am?" Bones asked, in astonishment. "Why, that's
my speciality!"</p>

<p>It was a delightful morning for the girl, for Bones had retired
to his cabin at her earnest request, and was struggling with the
company accounts, and she was left to enjoy the splendour of the
day, to watch the iron-red waters piling up against the Wiggle's
bows, to feel the cool breezes that swept down from the far-away
mountains, and all this without being under the necessity of making
conversation with Bones.</p>

<p>That gentleman had a no less profitable morning, for Ali Abid
was a methodical and clerkly man, and unearthed the missing
thirty-nine dollars in the Compensation Record.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" said Bones, relieved. "You're a jolly old
accountant, Ali. I'd never have found it."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, "some subjects, by impetuous application, omit
vision of intricate detail. This is due to subjects' lack of
concentration."</p>

<p>"Have it your way," said Bones, "but get the statement out for
me to copy."</p>

<p>He awoke the girl from a profound reverie&mdash;which centred
about shy and solemn bachelors who adopted whole nations of
murderous children as their own&mdash;and proceeded to "take
charge."</p>

<p>This implied the noisy issuing of orders which nobody carried
out, the manipulation of a telescope, anxious glances at the
heavens, deep and penetrating scrutinies at the water, and a
promenade back and forward from one side of the launch to the
other. Bones called this "pacing the bridge," and invariably
carried his telescope tucked under his arm in the process, and, as
he had to step over Pat's feet every time, and sometimes didn't,
she arrested his nautical wanderings.</p>

<p>"You make me dizzy," she said. "And isn't that the island?"</p>

<p>In the early hours of the afternoon they re-embarked, the capita
of the village coming to the beach to see them off.</p>

<p>They brought back with them a collection of spear-heads,
gruesome execution knives, elephant swords, and wonderworking steel
figures.</p>

<p>"And the lunch was simply lovely, Bones," agreed the girl, as
the Wiggle turned her nose homeward. "Really, you can be quite
clever sometimes."</p>

<p>"Dear old Miss Hamilton," said Bones, "you saw me to-day as I
really am. The mask was off, and the real Bones, kindly,
thoughtful, considerate, an'&mdash;if I may use the word without
your foundin' any great hope upon it&mdash;tender. You saw me free
from carkin' care, alert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go along and finish your accounts, like a good boy," she said.
"I'm going to doze."</p>

<p>Doze she did, for it was a warm, dozy afternoon, and the boat
was running swiftly and smoothly with the tide. Bones yawned and
wrote, copying All's elaborate and accurate statement, whilst Ali
himself slept contentedly on the top of the cabin. Even the
engineer dozed at his post, and only one man was wide awake and
watchful&mdash;Yoka, whose hands turned the wheel mechanically,
whose dark eyes never left the river ahead, with its shoals, its
sandbanks, and its snags, known and unknown.</p>

<p>Two miles from headquarters, where the river broadens before it
makes its sweep to the sea, there are three islands with narrow
passages between. At this season only one such passage&mdash;the
centre of all&mdash;is safe. This is known as "The Passage of the
Tree," because all boats, even the Zaire, must pass so close
beneath the overhanging boughs of a great lime that the boughs
brush their very funnels. Fortunately, the current is never strong
here, for the passage is a shallow one. Yoka felt the boat slowing
as he reached shoal water, and brought her nearer to the bank of
the island. He had reached the great tree, when a noose dropped
over him, tightened about his arms, and, before he could do more
than lock the wheel, he was jerked from the boat and left swinging
between bough and water.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"O Yoka," chuckled a voice from the bough, "between sunrise and
moonset is no long time for a man to be with his wife!"</p>

<p>Bones had finished his account, and was thinking. He thought
with his head on his hands, with his eyes shut, and his mouth open,
and his thought was accompanied by strange guttural noises.</p>

<p>Patricia Hamilton was also thinking, but much more gracefully.
Boosoobi sat by his furnace door, nodding. Sometimes he looked at
the steam gauge, sometimes he kicked open the furnace door and
chucked in a few billets of wood, but, in the main, he was
listening to the soothing "<i>chook-a-chook, chook-a-chook</i>" of
his well-oiled engines.</p>

<p>"Woo-yow!" yawned Bones, stretching himself, and came blinking
into the sunlight. The sun was nearly setting.</p>

<p>"What the dooce&mdash;" said Bones. He stared round.</p>

<p>The Wiggle had run out from the mouth of the river and was at
sea. There was no sign of land of any description. The low-lying
shore of the territory had long since gone under the horizon.</p>

<p>Bones laid his hand on the shoulder of the sleeping girl, and
she woke with a start.</p>

<p>"Dear old shipmate," he said, and his voice trembled, "we're
alone on this jolly old ocean! Lost the steersman!"</p>

<p>She realized the seriousness of the situation in a moment.</p>

<p>The dozing engineer, now wide awake, came aft at Bones's call,
and accepted the disappearance of the steersman without
astonishment.</p>

<p>"We'll have to go back," said Bones, as he swung the wheel
round. "I don't think I'm wrong in sayin' that the east is opposite
to the west, an', if that's true, we ought to be home in time for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Sar," said Boosoobi, who, being a coast boy, elected to speak
English, "dem wood she no lib."</p>

<p>"Hey?" gasped Bones, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Dem wood she be done. I look um. I see um. I no find um."</p>

<p>Bones sat down heavily on the rail.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" Pat asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"He says there's no more wood," said Bones. "The horrid old
bunkers are empty, an' we're at the mercy of the tempest."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bones!" she cried in consternation.</p>

<p>But Bones had recovered.</p>

<p>"What about swimmin' to shore with a line?" he said. "It can't
be more than ten miles!"</p>

<p>It was Ali Abid who prevented the drastic step.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "the subject on such occasions should act with
deliberate reserve. Proximity of land presupposes research. The
subject should assist rather than retard research by passivity of
action, easy respiration, and general normality of
temperature."</p>

<p>"Which means, dear old Miss Hamilton, that you've got to keep
your wool on," explained Bones.</p>

<p>What might have happened is not to be recorded, for at that
precise moment the SS Paretta came barging up over the horizon.</p>

<p>There was still steam in the Wiggle's little boiler, and one log
of wood to keep it at pressure.</p>

<p>Bones was incoherent, but again Ali came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "for intimating SOS-ness there is upon steamer
or launch certain scientific apparatus, unadjusted, but susceptible
to treatment."</p>

<p>"The wireless!" spluttered Bones. "Good lor', the wireless!"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the Wiggle ran alongside the gangway of the
SS Paretta, anticipating the arrival of the Zaire by half an
hour.</p>

<p>The SS Paretta was at anchor when Sanders brought the Zaire to
the scene.</p>

<p>He saw the Wiggle riding serenely by the side of the great ship,
looking for all the world like a humming bird under the wings of an
ostrich, and uttered a prayer of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"They're safe," he said to Hamilton. "O Yoka, take the Zaire to
the other side of the big boat."</p>

<p>"Master, do we go back to-night to seek Ko-buru?" asked Yoka,
who was bearing marks which indicated his strenuous experience, for
he had fought his way clear of his captors, and had swum with the
stream to headquarters.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is also a day," quoth Sanders.</p>

<p>Hamilton was first on the deck of the SS Paretta, and found his
sister and a debonair and complacent Bones waiting for him. With
them was an officer whom Hamilton recognized.</p>

<p>"Company accounts all correct, sir," said Bones, "audited by the
jolly old paymaster"&mdash;he saluted the other officer&mdash;"an'
found correct, sir, thus anticipatin' all your morose an' savage
criticisms."</p>

<p>Hamilton gripped his hand and grinned.</p>

<p>"Bones was really wonderful," said the girl, "they wouldn't have
seen us if it hadn't been for his idea."</p>

<p>"Saved by wireless, sir," said Bones nonchalantly. "It was a
mere nothin'&mdash;just a flash of inspiration."</p>

<p>"You got the wireless to work?" asked Hamilton
incredulously.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bones. "But I wanted a little extra steam to get
up to the ship, so I burnt the dashed thing. I knew it would come
in handy sooner or later."</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE REMEDY</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 44, Oct
1916, 509-515</h3>

<p class="first">BEYOND the far hills, which no man of the Ochori
passed, was a range of blue mountains, and behind this again was
the L'Mandi country. This adventurous hunting men of the Ochori had
seen, standing in a safe place on the edge of the Great King's
country. Also N'gombi people, who are notoriously disrespectful of
all ghosts save their own, had, upon a time, penetrated the
northern forest to a high knoll which Nature had shaped to the
resemblance of a hayrick.</p>

<p>A huntsman climbing this after his lawful quarry might gain a
nearer view of the blue mountains, all streaked with silver at
certain periods of the year, when a hundred streams came leaping
with feathery feet from crag to crag to strengthen the forces of
the upper river, or, as some said, to create through underground
channels the big lakes M'soobo and T'sambi at the back of the
N'gombi country.</p>

<p>And on summer nights, when the big yellow moon came up and
showed all things in her own chaste way, you might see from the
knoll of the hayrick these silver ribbons all a-glitter, though the
bulk of the mountain was lost to sight.</p>

<p>The river folk saw little of the L'Mandi, because L'Mandi
territory lies behind the country of the Great King, who looked
with a jealous eye upon comings and goings in his land, and
severely restricted the movement and the communications of his own
people.</p>

<p>The great King followed his uncle in the government of the
pleasant O'Mongo lands, and he had certain advantages and
privileges, the significance of which he very imperfectly
interpreted. His uncle had died suddenly at the hands of Mr.
Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., and the land itself might have passed
to the protection of the Crown, for there was gold in the country
in large and payable quantities.</p>

<p>That such a movement was arrested was due largely to the L'Mandi
and the influence they were able to exercise upon the European
Powers by virtue of their military qualities. Downing Street was
all for a permanent occupation of the chief city and the
institution of a conventional regime; but the L'Mandi snarled,
clicked their heels, and made jingling noises with their great
swords, and there was at that moment a government in office in
England which was rather impressed by heel-clicking and
sword-jingling, and so the territory of the Great King was left
intact, and was marked on all maps as Omongoland, and coloured red,
as being within the sphere of British influence. On the other hand,
the L'Mandi people had it tinted yellow, and described it as an
integral portion of the German Colonial Empire.</p>

<p>There was little communication between L'Mandi and Sanders's
territory, but that little was more than enough for the
Commissioner, since it took the shape of evangelical incursions
carried out by missionaries who were in the happy position of not
being obliged to say as much as "By your leave," since they had
secured from a Government which was, as I say, impressed by
heel-clicking and sword-jingling, an impressive document, charging
"all commissioners, sub-commissioners, magistrates, and officers
commanding our native forces," to give facilities to these good
Christian gentlemen.</p>

<p>There were missionaries in the Territories who looked askance at
their brethren, and Ferguson, of the River Mission, made a journey
to headquarters to lay his views upon the subject before the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"These fellows aren't missionaries at all, Mr. Sanders; they are
just political agents utilizing sacred symbols to further a
political propaganda."</p>

<p>"That is a Government palaver," smiled Sanders, and that was all
the satisfaction Ferguson received. Nevertheless, Sanders was
watchful, for there were times when the L'Mandi missioners and
their friends strayed outside their sphere.</p>

<p>Once the L'Mandi folk had landed in a village in the middle
Ochori, had flogged the headman, and made themselves free of the
commodities which the people of the village had put aside for the
payment of their taxation.</p>

<p>In his wrath, Bosambo, the chief, had taken ten war canoes; but
Sanders, who had been in the Akasava on a shooting trip, was there
before him, and had meted out swift justice to the evil-doers.</p>

<p>"And let me tell you, Bosambo," said Sanders severely, "that you
shall not bring spears except at my word."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Bosambo, frankness itself, "if I disobeyed you, it
was because I was too hot to think."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"That I know," he said. "Now I tell you this, Bosambo, and this
is the way of very wise men&mdash;that when they go to do evil
things with a hot heart, they first sleep, and in their sleep their
spirits go free and talk with the wise and the dead, and when they
wake, their hearts are cool, and they see all the folly of the
night, and their eyes are bright for their own faults."</p>

<p>"Master," said Bosambo, "you are my father and my mother, and
all the people of the river you carry in your arms. Now I say to
you that when I go to do an evil thing I will first sleep, and I
will make all my people sleep also."</p>

<p>There are strange stories in circulation as to the manner in
which Bosambo carried out this novel reform. There is the story of
an Ochori wife-beater who, adjured by his chief, retired to slumber
on his grievance, and came to his master the following morning with
the information that he had not closed his eyes. Whereupon Bosambo
clubbed him insensible, in order that Sanders's plan might have a
fair chance.</p>

<p>At least, this is the story which Hamilton retailed at breakfast
one morning. Sanders, appealed to for confirmation, admitted
cautiously that he had heard the legend, but did not trouble to
make an investigation.</p>

<p>"The art of governing a native country," he said, "is the art of
not asking questions."</p>

<p>"But suppose you want to know something?" demanded Patricia.</p>

<p>"Then," said Sanders, with a twinkle in his eyes, "you must
pretend that you know."</p>

<p>"What is there to do to-day?" asked Hamilton, rolling his
serviette.</p>

<p>He addressed himself to Lieutenant Tibbetts, who, to Sanders's
intense annoyance, invariably made elaborate notes of all the
Commissioner said.</p>

<p>"Nothin' until this afternoon, sir," said Bones, closing his
note-book briskly, "then we're doin' a little deep-sea
fishin'."</p>

<p>The girl made a grimace.</p>

<p>"We didn't catch anything yesterday, Bones," she objected.</p>

<p>"We used the wrong kind of worm," said Bones confidently. "I've
found a new worm nest in the plantation. Jolly little fellers they
are, too."</p>

<p>"What are we doing to-day, Bones?" repeated Hamilton
ominously.</p>

<p>Bones puckered his brows.</p>

<p>"Deep-sea fishin', dear old officer and comrade," he repeated,
"an' after dinner a little game of tiddly-winks&mdash;Bones v.
jolly old Hamilton's sister, for the championship of the River an'
the Sanders Cup."</p>

<p>Hamilton breathed deeply, but was patient.</p>

<p>"Your King and your country," he said, "pay you seven and
eightpence per diem&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bones, a light dawning, "you mean work?"</p>

<p>"Strange, is it not," mused Hamilton, "that we should
consider&mdash;Hullo!"</p>

<p>They followed the direction of his eyes.</p>

<p>A white bird was circling groggily above the plantation, as
though uncertain where to alight. There was weariness in the beat
of its wings, in the irregularity of its flight. Bones leapt over
the rail of the verandah and ran towards the square. He slowed down
as he came to a place beneath the bird, and whistled softly.</p>

<p>Bones's whistle was a thing of remarkable sweetness&mdash;it was
his one accomplishment, according to Hamilton, and had neither tune
nor rhyme. It was a succession of trills, rising and falling, and
presently, after two hesitating swoops, the bird rested on his
outstretched hand. He came back to the verandah and handed the
pigeon to Sanders.</p>

<p>The Commissioner lifted the bird and with gentle fingers removed
the slip of thin paper fastened to its leg by a rubber band.</p>

<p>Before he opened the paper he handed the weary little servant of
the Government to an orderly.</p>

<p>"Lord, this is Sombubo," said Abiboo, and he lifted the pigeon
to his cheek, "and he comes from the Ochori."</p>

<p>Sanders had recognized the bird, for Sombubo was the swiftest,
the wisest, and the strongest of all his messengers, and was never
dispatched except on the most critical occasions.</p>

<p>He smoothed the paper and read the letter, which was in
Arabic.</p>

<p>"From the servant of God Bosambo, in the Ochori City, to Sandi,
where-the-sea-runs.</p>

<p>"There have come three white men from the L'Mandi country, and
they have crossed the mountains. They sit with the Akasava in full
palaver. They say there shall be no more taxes for the People of
the River, but there shall come a new king greater than any. And
every man shall have goats and salt and free hunting. They say the
Akasava shall be given all the Ochori country, also guns like the
white man. Many guns and a thousand carriers are in the mountains
waiting to come. I hold the Ochori with all my spears, Also the
Isisi chief calls his young men for your King.</p>

<p>"Peace be on your house in the name of Allah Compassionate and
Merciful."</p>

<p>"M-m!" said Sanders, as he folded the paper. "I'm afraid there
will be no fishing this afternoon. Bones, take the Wiggle and get
up to the Akasava as fast as you can; I will follow on the Zaire.
Abiboo!"</p>

<p>"Lord?"</p>

<p>"You will find me a swift Ochori pigeon. Hamilton, scribble a
line to Bosambo, and say that he shall meet Bones by Sokala's
village."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Bones was sending incomprehensible semaphore
signals of farewell as the Wiggle slipped round the bend of the
river.</p>

<p>Sokala, a little chief of the Isisi, was a rich man. He had ten
wives, each of whom lived in her own hut. Also each wife wore about
her neck a great ring of brass weighing twenty pounds, to testify
to the greatness and wealth of her lord.</p>

<p>Sokala was wizened and lined of face, and across his forehead
were many deep furrows, and it seemed that he lived in a state of
perplexity as to what should become of all his riches when he died,
for he was cursed with ten daughters&mdash;O'femi, Jubasami,
K'sola, M'kema, Wasonga, Mombari, et cetera.</p>

<p>When Wasonga was fourteen, there was revealed to Sokala, her
father, a great wonder.</p>

<p>The vision came at the tail end of a year of illness, when his
head had ached for weeks together, and not even the brass wire
twisted lightly about his skull brought him relief.</p>

<p>Sokala was lying on his fine bed of skins, wondering why strange
animals sat by the fire in the centre of his hut, and why they
showed their teeth and talked in human language. Sometimes they
were leopards, sometimes they were little white-whiskered monkeys
that scratched and told one another stories, and these monkeys were
the wisest of all, for they discussed matters which were of urgency
to the sick man rolling restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p>On this great night two such animals had appeared suddenly, a
big grey fellow with a solemn face, and a very little one, and they
sat staring into the fire, mechanically seeking their fleas until
the little one spoke.</p>

<p>"Sokala is very rich and has ten daughters."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the other; "also he will die because he has
no son."</p>

<p>Sokala's heart beat furiously with fear, but he listened when
the little black monkey spoke.</p>

<p>"If Sokala took Wasonga, his daughter, into the forest near to
The Tree and slew her, his daughters would become sons and he would
grow well."</p>

<p>And the other monkey nodded.</p>

<p>As they talked, Sokala recognized the truth of all that they had
said. He wondered that he had never thought of the matter before in
this way. All night long he lay thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;long
after the fires had died down to a full red glow amidst white
ashes, and the monkeys had vanished. In the cold dawn his people
found him sitting on the side of the bed, and marvelled that he
should have lived the night through.</p>

<p>"Send me Wasooga, my daughter," he said, and they brought a
sleepy girl of fourteen, tall, straight and wholly reluctant. "We
go a journey," said Sokala, and took from beneath his bed his
wicker shield and his sharp-edged throwing-spear.</p>

<p>"Sokala hunts," said the people of the village significantly,
and they knew that the end was very near, for he had been a great
hunter, and men turn in death to the familiar pursuits of life.</p>

<p>Three miles on the forest road to the Isisi city, Sokala bade
his daughter sit on the ground.</p>

<p>Bones had met and was in earnest conversation with the Chief of
the Ochori, the Wiggle being tied up at a wooding, when he heard a
scream, and saw a girl racing through the wood towards him.</p>

<p>Behind her, with the foolish stare on his face which comes to
men in the last stages of sleeping sickness, his spear balanced,
came Sokala.</p>

<p>The girl tumbled in a wailing, choking heap at Bones's feet, and
her pursuer checked at the sight of the white man.</p>

<p>"I see you, Sokala,*" said Bones gently.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The native equivalent for "Good
morning."]</p>

<p>"Lord," said the old man, blinking at the officer of the
Houssas, "you shall see a wonderful magic when I slay this woman,
for my daughters shall be sons, and I shall be a well man."</p>

<p>Bones took the spear from his unresisting hand.</p>

<p>"I will show you a greater magic, Sokala, for I will give you a
little white stone which will melt like salt in your mouth, and you
shall sleep."</p>

<p>The old man peered from Lieutenant Tibbetts to the King of the
Ochori. He watched Bones as he opened his medicine chest and shook
out two little white pellets from a bottle marked "Veronal," and
accepted them gratefully.</p>

<p>"God bless my life," cried Bones, "don't chew 'em, you dear old
silly&mdash;swallow 'em!"</p>

<p>"Lord," said Sokala soberly, "they have a beautiful and a magic
taste."</p>

<p>Bones sent the frightened girl back to the village, and made the
old man sit by a tree.</p>

<p>"O Tibbetti," said Bosambo, in admiration, "that was a good
palaver. For it is better than the letting of blood, and no one
will know that Sokala did not die in his time."</p>

<p>Bones looked at him in horror.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious heavens, Bosambo," he gasped, "you don't
think I've poisoned him?"</p>

<p>"Master," said Bosambo, nodding his head, "he die one
time&mdash;he not fit for lib&mdash;you give um plenty no-good
stuff. You be fine Christian feller same like me."</p>

<p>Bones wiped the perspiration from his brow and explained the
action of veronal. Bosambo was sceptical. Even when Sokala fell
into a profound slumber, Bosambo waited expectantly for his death.
And when he realized that Bones had spoken the truth, he was a most
amazed man.</p>

<p>"Master," he said, in that fluid Ochori dialect which seems to
be made up of vowels, "this is a great magic. Now I see very surely
that you hold wonderful ju-jus, and I have wronged you, for I
thought you were without wisdom."</p>

<p>"Cheer-oh!" said the gratified Bones.</p>

<p>Near by the city of the Akasava is a small hill on which no
vegetation grows, though it rises from a veritable jungle of
undergrowth. The Akasava call this place the Hill of the Women,
because it was here that M'lama, the King of the Akasava, slew a
hundred Akasava maidens to propitiate M'shimba M'shamba, the god of
storms. It was on the topmost point of the hill that Sanders
erected a fine gallows and hung M'lama for his country's good. It
had always been associated with the spiritual history of the
Akasava, for ghosts and devils and strange ju-jus had their home
hereabouts, and every great decision at which the people arrived
was made upon its slopes. At the crest was a palaver house&mdash;no
more than a straw-thatched canopy affording shelter for four men at
the most.</p>

<p>On a certain afternoon all the chiefs, great and minor, the
headmen, the warriors, and the leaders of fishing villages of the
Akasava, squatted in a semicircle and listened to the oration of a
bearded man, who spoke easily in the river dialect of the happy
days which were coming to the people.</p>

<p>By his side were two other white men&mdash;a tall, cleanshaven
man with spectacles, and a stouter man with a bristling white
moustache.</p>

<p>Had the bearded man's address been in plain English, or even in
plain German, and had it been delivered to European hearers
accustomed to taking its religion in allegories and symbols, it
would have been harmless. As it was, the illustrations and the
imagery which the speaker employed had no other interpretation to
the simple-minded Akasava than a purely material one.</p>

<p>"I speak for the Great King," said the orator, throwing out his
arms, "a king who is more splendid than any. He has fierce and
mighty armies that cover the land like ants. He holds thunder and
lightning in his hand, and is greater than M'shimba M'shamba. He is
the friend of the black man and the white, and will deliver you
from all oppression. He will give you peace and full crops, and
make you capita over your enemies. When he speaks, all other kings
tremble. He is a great buffalo, and the pawing of his hoofs shakes
the earth.</p>

<p>"This he says to you, the warrior people of the
Akasava&mdash;"</p>

<p>The message was destined to be undelivered.</p>

<p>Heads began to turn, and there was a whisper of words. Some of
the audience half rose, some on the outskirts of the gathering
stole quietly away&mdash;the lesser chiefs were amongst
these&mdash;and others, sitting stolidly on, assumed a blandness
and a scepticism of demeanour calculated to meet the needs of the
occasion.</p>

<p>For Sanders was at the foot of the hill, a trim figure in white,
his solar helmet pushed back to cover the nape of his neck from the
slanting rays of the sun, and behind Sanders were two white
officers and a company of Houssas with fixed bayonets. Not a word
said Sanders, but slowly mounted the Hill of the Dead. He reached
the palaver house and turned.</p>

<p>"Let no man go," he said, observing the disposition of the
gathering to melt away, "for this is a great palaver, and I come to
speak for these God-men."</p>

<p>The bearded orator glared at the Commissioner and half turned to
his companions. The stout man with the moustache said something
quickly, but Sanders silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<br>

<p>"O people," said Sanders, "you all know that under my King men
may live in peace, and death comes quickly to those who make war.
Also you may worship in what manner you desire, though it be my God
or the famous gods of your fathers. And such as preach of God or
gods have full liberty. Who denies this?"</p>

<p>"Lord, you speak the truth," said an eager headman.</p>

<p>"Therefore," said Sanders, "my King has given these God-men a
book* that they may speak to you, and they have spoken. Of a great
king they tell. Also of wonders which will come to you if you obey
him. But this king is the same king of whom the God-cross men and
the water-God men tell. For he lives beyond the stars, and his name
is God. Tell me, preacher, is this the truth?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A book = written permission, any kind of
document or writing]</p>

<p>The bearded man swallowed something and muttered, "This is
true."</p>

<p>"Also, there is no king in this world greater than my King, whom
you serve," Sanders continued, "and it is your duty to be obedient
to him, and his name is D'jorja." Sanders raised his hand to his
helmet in salute. "This also the God-men will tell you." He turned
to the three evangelists.</p>

<p>Herr Professor Wiessmann hesitated for the fraction of a second.
The pause was pardonable, for he saw the undoing of three months'
good work, and his thoughts at that moment were with a certain
party of carriers who waited in the mountains.</p>

<p>"The question of earthly and heavenly domination is always
debatable," he began in English, but Sanders stopped him.</p>

<p>"We will speak in the Akasava tongue," he said, "and let all men
hear. Tell me, shall my people serve my King, or shall they serve
another?"</p>

<p>"They shall serve your King," growled the man, "for it is the
law."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Sanders in English. The gathering slowly
dispersed, leaving only the white men on the hill and a few
lingering folk at the foot, watching the stolid native soldiery
with an apprehension born of experience.</p>

<p>"We should like you to dine with us," said Sanders
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The leader of the L'Mandi mission hesitated, but the thin man
with the spectacles, who had been silent, answered for him.</p>

<p>"We shall be pleased, Mr. Commissioner," he said. "After eating
with these swine for a month, a good dinner would be very
acceptable."</p>

<p>Sanders said nothing, though he winced at the inelegant
description of his people, and the three evangelists went back to
their huts, which had been built for their use by the Akasava
chief.</p>

<p>An hour later that worthy sent for a certain witch-doctor.</p>

<p>"Go secretly," he said, "and call all headmen and chiefs to the
Breaking Tree in the forest. There they shall be until the moon
comes up, and the L'Mandi lords will come and speak freely. And you
shall tell them that the word he spoke before Sandi was no true
word, but to-night he shall speak the truth, and when Sandi is gone
we shall have wonderful guns and destroy all who oppose us."</p>

<p>This the witch-doctor did, and came back by the river path.</p>

<p>Here, by all accounts, he met Bosambo, and would have passed on;
but the chief of the Ochori, being in a curious mind and being,
moreover, suspicious, was impressed by the importance of the
messenger, and made inquiries...</p>

<p>An old man is a great lover of life, and after the witchdoctor's
head had been twice held under water&mdash;for the river was
providentially near&mdash;he gasped the truth.</p>

<p>The three missioners were very grateful guests indeed. They were
the more grateful because Patricia Hamilton was an unexpected
hostess. They clicked their heels and kissed her hand and drank her
health many times in good hock. The dinner was a feast worthy of
Lucullus, they swore, the wine was perfect, and the
coffee&mdash;which Abiboo handed round with a solemn face&mdash;was
wonderful.</p>

<p>They sat chatting for a time, and then the bearded man, looked
at his watch.</p>

<p>"To bed, gentlemen," he said gaily. "We leave you, Herr
Commissioner, in good friendship, we trust?"</p>

<p>"Oh, most excellent," said Sanders awkwardly, for he was a poor
liar, and knew that his spies were waiting on the bank to "pick up"
these potential enemies of his.</p>

<p>He watched them go ashore and disappear into the darkness of the
forest path that leads to the village.</p>

<p>The moon was rising over the tall trees, and an expectant
gathering of Akasava notables were waiting for a white spokesman
who came not, when Bosambo and his bodyguard were engaged in
lifting three unconscious men and laying them in a large canoe. He
himself paddled the long boat to midstream, where two currents run
swiftly, one to the sea and one to the Isisi River, which winds for
a hundred miles until it joins the Congo.</p>

<p>"Go with God," said Bosambo piously, as he stepped into his own
canoe, and released his hold of the other with its slumbering
freight, "for if your king is so great, he will bring you to your
own lands; and if he is not great, then you are liars. O
Abiboo"&mdash;he spoke over his shoulder to the sergeant of
Houssas&mdash;"tell me, how many of the magic white stones of
Bonesi did you put in their drink?"</p>

<p>"Bosambo, I put four in each, as you told me, and if my lord
Tibbetti misses them, what shall I say?"</p>

<p>"You shall say," said Bosambo, "that this is Sandi's own
word&mdash;that when men plan evils they must first sleep. And I
think these men will sleep for a long time. Perhaps they will sleep
for ever&mdash;all things are with God."</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE MEDICINE MAN</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 44, Nov
1916, pp 651-657</h3>

<p class="first">AT the flood season, before the turbulent
tributaries of the Isisi River had been induced to return to their
accustomed channels, Sanders came back to headquarters a very weary
man, for he had spent a horrid week in an
endeavour&mdash;successful, but none the less
nerve-racking&mdash;to impress an indolent people that the swamping
of their villages was less a matter of Providence and ghosts than
the neglect of elementary precaution.</p>

<p>"For I told you, Ranabini," said an exasperated Sanders, "that
you should keep the upper channel free from trees and branches, and
I have paid you many bags of salt for your services."</p>

<p>"Lord, it is so," said Ranabini, scratching his brown leg
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"At the full of the moon, before the rains, did I not ask you if
the channel was clear, and did you not say it was like the street
of your village?" demanded Sanders, in wrath.</p>

<p>"Lord," said Ranabini frankly, "I lied to you, thinking your
lordship was mad. For what other man would foresee with his
wonderful eye that rains would come? Therefore, lord, I did not
think of the upper channel, and many trees floated down and made a
little dam. Lord, I am an ignorant man, and my mind is full of my
own brother, who has come from a long distance to see me, for he is
a very sick man."</p>

<p>Sanders's mind was occupied by no thought of Ranabini's sick
brother, as the dazzling white Zaire went thrashing her way down
stream. For he himself was a tired man, and needed rest, and there
was a dose of malaria looming in the offing, as his aching head
told him. It was as though his brains were arranged in slats, like
a Venetian blind, and these slats were opening and closing swiftly,
bringing with each lightning flicker a momentary
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Captain Hamilton met him on the quay, and when Sanders landed
&mdash;walking a thought unsteadily, and instantly began a long and
disjointed account of his adventures on a Norwegian salmon
river&mdash; Hamilton took him by the arm and led the way to the
bungalow.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he was assisting Sanders into his pyjamas,
Sanders protesting, albeit feebly, and when, after forcing an
astonishing amount of quinine and arsenic down his chief's throat,
Hamilton came from the semi-darkness of the bungalow to the white
glare of the barrack square, Hamilton was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Let one of your women watch by the bed of the lord Sandi," said
he to Sergeant Abiboo, of the Houssas, "and she shall call me if he
grows worse."</p>

<p>"On my life," said Abiboo, and was going off.</p>

<p>"Where is Tibbetti?" asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>The sergeant turned back and seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "Tibbetts has gone with the lady, your sister,
to make a palaver with Jimbujini, the witch doctor of the Akasava.
They sit in the forest in a magic circle, and lo! Tibbetti grows
very wise."</p>

<p>Hamilton swore under his breath. He had ordered Lieutenant
Tibbetts, his second-in-command, prop, stay, and aide-de-camp, to
superintend the drill of some raw Kano recruits who had been sent
from the coast.</p>

<p>"Go tell the lord Tibbetti to come to me," he said, "but first
send your woman to Sandi."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, with his plain, boyish face all red with
his exertions, yet dignified withal, came hurriedly from his
studies.</p>

<p>"Come aboard, sir," he said, and saluted extravagantly, blinking
at his superior with a curious solemnity of mien which was his own
peculiar expression.</p>

<p>"Bones," said Hamilton, "where the dickens have you been?"</p>

<p>Bones drew a long breath. He hesitated, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knowledge," he said shortly.</p>

<p>Hamilton looked at his subordinate in alarm.</p>

<p>"Dash it, you aren't off your head, too, are you?"</p>

<p>Bones shook his head with vigour.</p>

<p>"Knowledge of the occult, sir and brother-officer," he said.
"One is never too old to learn, sir, in this jolly old world."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Hamilton; "in fact, I'm pretty certain that
you'll never live long enough to learn everything."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Bones.</p>

<p>The girl, who had less qualms than Bones when the summons
arrived, and had, in consequence, returned more leisurely, came
into the room.</p>

<p>"Pat," said her brother, "Sanders is down with fever."</p>

<p>"Fever!" she said a little breathlessly. "It
isn't&mdash;dangerous?"</p>

<p>Bones, smiling indulgently, soothed her.</p>

<p>"Nothin' catchin', dear Miss Patricia Hamilton... " he
began,</p>

<p>"Please don't be stupid," she said so fiercely that Bones
recoiled. "Do you think I'm afraid of catching anything? Is it
dangerous for Mr. Sanders?" she asked her brother.</p>

<p>"No more dangerous than a cold in the head," he answered
flippantly. "My dear child, we all have fever. You'll have it, too,
if you go out at sunset without your mosquito boots."</p>

<p>He explained, with the easy indifference of a man inured to
malaria, the habits of the mosquito&mdash;his predilection for
ankles and wrists, where the big veins and arteries are nearer to
the surface&mdash;but the girl was not reassured. She would have
sat up with Sanders, but the idea so alarmed Hamilton that she
abandoned it. "He'd never forgive me," he said. "My dear girl,
he'll be as right as a trivet in the morning."</p>

<p>She was sceptical, but, to her amazement, Sanders turned up at
breakfast his usual self, save that he was a little weary-eyed, and
that his hand shook when he raised his coffee-cup to his lips. A
miracle, thought Patricia Hamilton, and said so.</p>

<p>"Not at all, dear miss," said Bones, now as ever, accepting full
credit for all phenomena she praised, whether natural or
supernatural. "This is simply nothin' to what happened to me. Ham,
dear old feller, do you remember when I was brought down from the
Machengombi River? Simply delirious&mdash;ravin'&mdash;off my
head."</p>

<p>"So much so," said Hamilton, slicing the top off his egg, "that
we didn't think you were ill."</p>

<p>"If you'd seen me," Bones went on, solemnly shaking one skinny
forefinger at the girl, "you'd have said: 'Bones is for the High
Jump.' "</p>

<p>"I should have said nothing so vulgar, Bones," she retorted.
"And was it malaria?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Hamilton triumphantly, "I was too much of a gentleman
to hint that it wasn't. Press the question, Pat."</p>

<p>Bones shrugged his shoulders and cast a look of withering
contempt upon his superior.</p>

<p>"In the execution of one's duty, dear Miss Patricia H," he said,
"the calibre of the gun that lays a fellow low, an' plunges his
relations an' creditors into mournin', is beside the point. The
only consideration, as dear old Omar says, is&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">'The movin' finger hits, an', havin' hit,<br>
Moves on, tum tumpty tumpty tay,<br>
And all a feller does won't make the slightest difference.'"</p>
<br>

<p>"Is that Omar or Shakespeare?" asked the dazed Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, dear. What was the illness, Bones?"</p>

<p>"Measles," said Hamilton brutally, "and German measles at
that."</p>

<p>"Viciously put, dear old officer, but, nevertheless, true," said
Bones buoyantly. "But when the hut's finished, I'll return good for
evil. There's goin' to be a revolution, Miss Patricia Hamilton. No
more fever, no more measles&mdash;health, wealth, an' wisdom, by
gad!"</p>

<p>"Sunstroke," diagnosed Hamilton. "Pull yourself together, Bones
&mdash;you're amongst friends."</p>

<p>But Bones was superior to sarcasm.</p>

<p>There was a creature of Lieutenant Tibbetts, a solemn, brown
man, who possessed, in addition to a vocabulary borrowed from a
departed professor of bacteriology, a rough working knowledge of
the classics. This man's name was, as I have already explained,
Abid Ali or Ali Abid, and in him Bones discovered a treasure beyond
price.</p>

<p>Bones had recently built himself a large square hut near the
seashore&mdash;that is to say, he had, with the expenditure of a
great amount of midnight oil, a pair of compasses, a box of paints,
and a T-square, evolved a somewhat complicated plan whereon certain
blue oblongs stood for windows, and certain red cones indicated
doors. To this he had added an elevation in the severe Georgian
style.</p>

<p>With his plan beautifully drawn to scale, with sectional
diagrams and side elevations embellishing its margin, he had
summoned Mojeri of the Lower Isisi, famous throughout the land as a
builder of great houses, and to him he had entrusted the execution
of his design.</p>

<p>"This you shall build for me, Mojeri," said Bones, sucking the
end of his pencil and gazing lovingly at the plan outspread before
him, "and you shall be famous all through the world. This room
shall be twice as large as that, and you shall cunningly contrive a
passage so that I may move from one room to the other, and none see
me come or go. Also, this shall be my sleeping-place, and this a
great room where I will practise powerful magics."</p>

<p>Mojeri took the plan in his hand and looked at it. He turned it
upside down and looked at it that way. Then he looked at it
sideways.</p>

<p>"Lord," said he, putting down the plan with a reverent hand,
"all these wonders I shall remember."</p>

<p>"And did he?" asked Hamilton, when Bones described the
interview.</p>

<p>Bones blinked and swallowed.</p>

<p>"He went away and built me a square hut&mdash;just a plain
square hut. Mojeri is an ass, sir&mdash;a jolly old fraud an'
humbug, sir. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me see the plan," said Hamilton, and his subordinate
produced the cartridge paper.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Hamilton, after a careful scrutiny. "Very pretty.
But how did you get into your room?"</p>

<p>"Through the door, dear old officer," said the sarcastic
Bones.</p>

<p>"I thought it might be through the roof," said Hamilton, "or
possibly you made one of your famous dramatic entries through a
star-trap in the floor&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">'Who is it speaks in those sepulchral tones?<br>
It is the demon king&mdash;the grisly Bones!'</p>
<br>

<p class="first">"Bing! and up you pop amidst red fire and
smoke."</p>

<p>A light dawned on Bones.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, jolly old Ham, that I forgot to put a
door into my room?" he asked incredulously, and peered over his
chief's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That is what I mean, Bones. And where does the passage lead
to?"</p>

<p>"That goes straight from my sleepin' room to the room marked L,"
said Bones, in triumph.</p>

<p>"Then you were going to be a demon king." said the admiring
Hamilton. "But fortunately for you. Bones, the descent to L is not
so easy&mdash;you've drawn a party wall across&mdash;"</p>

<p>"L stands for laboratory," explained the architect hurriedly.
"An' where's the wall? God bless my jolly old soul, so I have!
Anyway, that could have been rectified in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Speaking largely," said Hamilton, after a careful scrutiny of
the plan, "I think Mojeri has acted wisely. You will have to be
content with one room. What was the general idea of the house,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Science an' general illumination of the human mind," said Bones
comprehensively.</p>

<p>"I see," said Hamilton. "You were going to make fireworks. A
splendid idea, Bones."</p>

<p>"Painful as it is to undeceive you, dear old sir," said Bones,
with admirable patience, "I must tell you that I'm takin' up my
medical studies where I left off. Recently I've been wastin' my
time, sir: precious hours an' minutes have been passed in frivolous
amusement&mdash;<i>tempus fugit</i>, sir an' captain, <i>festina
lente</i>, an' I might add&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't," begged Hamilton; "you give me a headache."</p>

<p>There was a look of interest in Bones's eyes.</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed to prescribe, sir&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'd rather have the headache," replied Hamilton
hastily.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week before the laboratory was fitted that Bones
gave a house-warming, which took the shape of an afternoon tea.
Bones, arrayed in a long white coat, wearing a ferocious lint mask
attached to huge mica goggles, through which he glared on the
world, met the party at the door and bade them a muffled welcome.
They found the interior of the hut a somewhat uncomfortable place.
The glass retorts, test tubes, bottles, and the paraphernalia of
science which Bones had imported crowded the big table, the
shelves, and even overflowed on to the three available chairs.</p>

<p>"Welcome to my little workroom," said the hollow voice of Bones
from behind the mask. "Wel&mdash;Don't put your foot in the
crucible, dear old officer! You're sittin' on the methylated
spirits, ma'am! Phew!"</p>

<p>Bones removed his mask and showed a hot, red face.</p>

<p>"Don't take it off, Bones," begged Hamilton; "it improves
you."</p>

<p>Sanders was examining the microscope, which stood under a big
glass shade.</p>

<p>"You're very complete, Bones," he said approvingly. "In what
branch of science are you dabbling?"</p>

<p>"Tropical diseases, sir," said Bones promptly, and lifted the
shade. "I'm hopin' you'll allow me to have a look at your blood
after tea."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Sanders. "You had better practise on
Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Don't come near me!" threatened Hamilton.</p>

<p>It was Patricia who, when the tea-things had been removed,
played the heroine.</p>

<p>"Take mine," she said, and extended her hand.</p>

<p>Bones found a needle, and sterilized it in the flame of a spirit
lamp.</p>

<p>"This won't hurt you," he quavered, and brought the point near
the white firm flesh. Then he drew it back again.</p>

<p>"This won't hurt you, dear old miss," he croaked, and repeated
the performance.</p>

<p>He stood up and wiped his streaming brow.</p>

<p>"I haven't the heart to do it," he said dismally.</p>

<p>"A pretty fine doctor you are, Bones!" she scoffed, and took the
needle from his hand. "There!"</p>

<p>Bones put the tiny crimson speck between his slides, blobbed a
drop of oil on top, and focused the microscope.</p>

<p>He looked for a long time, then turned a scared face to the
girl.</p>

<p>"Sleepin' sickness, poor dear old Miss Hamilton!" he gasped.
"You're simply full of tryps! Good Lord! What a blessin' for you I
discovered it!"</p>

<br>

<p>Sanders pushed the young scientist aside and looked. When he
turned his head, the girl saw his face was white and drawn, and for
a moment a sense of panic overcame her.</p>

<p>"You silly ass," growled the Commissioner, "they aren't
trypanosomes! You haven't cleaned the infernal eyepiece!"</p>

<p>"Not trypanosomes?" said Bones.</p>

<p>"You seem disappointed, Bones," said Hamilton.</p>

<p>"As a man, I'm overjoyed," replied Bones gloomily; "as a
scientist, it's a set-back, dear old officer&mdash;a distinct
set-back."</p>

<p>The house-warming lasted a much shorter time than the host had
intended. This was largely due to the failure of a very beautiful
experiment which he had projected. In order that the rare and
wonderful result at which he aimed should be achieved, Bones had
the hut artificially darkened, and they sat in a dark and sticky
blackness, whilst he knocked over bottles and swore softly at the
instruments his groping hand could not discover. And the end of the
experiment was a large, bad smell.</p>

<p>"The women and children first," said Hamilton, and dived for the
door.</p>

<p>They took farewell of Bones at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Hamilton went across to the Houssa lines, and Sanders walked
back to the Residency with the girl. For a little while they spoke
of Bones and his newest craze, and then suddenly the girl
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"You didn't really think there were any of those funny things in
my blood, did you?"</p>

<p>Sanders looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;you see, we know&mdash;the tryp is a distinct
little body, and anybody who had lived in this part of the world
for a time can pick him out. Bones, of course, knows nothing
thoroughly&mdash;I should have remembered that."</p>

<p>She said nothing until they reached the verandah, and she turned
to go to her room.</p>

<p>"It wasn't nice, was it?" she said.</p>

<p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

<p>"It was a taste of hell," he said simply. And she fetched a
quick, long sigh and patted his arm before she realized what she
was doing.</p>

<p>Bones, returning from his hut, met Sanders hurrying across the
square.</p>

<p>"Bones, I want you to go up to the Isisi," said the
Commissioner. "There's an outbreak of some weird disease, probably
due to the damming of the little river by Ranabini, and the
flooding of the low forests."</p>

<p>Bones brightened up.</p>

<p>"Sir an' Excellency," he said gratefully, "comin' from you, this
tribute to my scientific&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Bones!" said Sanders irritably. "Your job is
to make these beggars work. They'll simply sit and die unless you
start them on drainage work. Cut a few ditches with a fall to the
river; kick Ranabini for me; take up a few kilos of quinine and
dose them."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bones managed to smuggle on board quite a
respectable amount of scientific apparatus, and came in good heart
to the despondent folk of the Lower Isisi.</p>

<p>Three weeks after Bones had taken his departure, Sanders was
sitting at dinner in a very thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>Patricia had made several ineffectual attempts to draw him into
a conversation, and had been answered in monosyllables. At first
she had been piqued and a little angry, but, as the meal
progressed, she realized that matters of more than ordinary
seriousness were occupying his thoughts, and wisely changed her
attitude of mind. A chance reference to Bones, however, succeeded
where more pointed attempts had failed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sanders, in answer to the question she had put,
"Bones has some rough idea of medical practice. He was a cub
student at Bart's for two years before he realized that surgery and
medicines weren't his forte."</p>

<p>"Don't you sometimes feel the need of a doctor here?" she asked,
and Sanders smiled.</p>

<p>"There is very little necessity. The military doctor comes down
occasionally from headquarters, and we have a native apothecary. We
have few epidemics amongst the natives, and those the medical
missions deal with sleep-sickness, beri-beri and the like.
Sometimes, of course, we have a pretty bad outbreak which
spreads&mdash;Don't go, Hamilton&mdash;I want to see you for a
minute."</p>

<p>Hamilton had risen, and was making for his room, with a little
nod to his sister.</p>

<p>At Sanders's word he turned.</p>

<p>"Walk with me for a few minutes," said Sanders, and, with an
apology to the girl he followed the other from the room.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>Sanders was perturbed&mdash;this he knew, and his own move
towards his room was in the nature of a challenge for
information.</p>

<p>"Bones," said the Commissioner shortly. "Do you realize that we
have had no news from him since he left?"</p>

<p>Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>"He's an erratic beggar, but nothing could have happened to him,
or we should have heard about it."</p>

<p>Sanders did not reply at once. He paced up and down the
gravelled path before the Residency, his hands behind him.</p>

<p>"No news has come from Ranabini's village for the simple reason
that nobody has entered or left it since Bones arrived," he said.
"It is situated, as you know, on a tongue of land at the confluence
of two rivers. No boat has left the beaches, and an attempt to
reach it by land has been prevented by force."</p>

<p>"By force?" repeated the startled Hamilton.</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"I had a report in this morning. Two men of the Isisi from
another village went to call on some relations. They were greeted
with arrows, and returned hurriedly. The headman of M'gomo village
met with the same reception. This came to the ears of my chief spy
Ahmet, who attempted to paddle to the island in his canoe. At a
distance of two hundred yards he was fired upon."</p>

<p>"Then they've got Bones?" gasped Hamilton.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Bones nearly got Ahmet, for Bones was the
marksman."</p>

<p>The two men paced the path in silence.</p>

<p>"Either Bones has gone mad," said Hamilton, " or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Hamilton laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>"I can't fathom the mystery," he said. "McMasters will be down
to-morrow, to look at some sick men. We'll take him up, and examine
the boy."</p>

<p>It was a subdued little party that boarded the Zaire the
following morning, and Patricia Hamilton, who came to see them off,
watched their departure with a sense of impending trouble.</p>

<p>Dr. McMasters alone was cheerful, for this excursion represented
a break in a somewhat monotonous routine.</p>

<p>"It may be the sun," he suggested. "I have known several fellows
who have gone a little nutty from that cause. I remember a man at
Grand Bassam who shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Mac, you grisly devil!" snapped Hamilton. "Talk
about butterflies."</p>

<p>The Zaire swung round the bend of the river that hid Ranabini's
village from view, but had scarcely come into sight when&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ping!"</p>

<p>Sanders saw the bullet strike the river ahead of the boat, and
send a spiral column of water shooting into the air. He put up his
glasses and focused them on the village beach.</p>

<p>"Bones!" he said grimly. "Take her in, Abiboo."</p>

<p>As the steersman spun the wheel&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ping!"</p>

<p>This time the shot fell to the right.</p>

<p>The three white men looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Let every man take cover," said Sanders quietly. "We're going
to that beach even if Bones has a battery of 75's!"</p>

<p>An exclamation from Hamilton arrested him.</p>

<p>"He's signalling," said the Houssa Captain, and Sanders put up
the glasses again.</p>

<p>Bone's long arms were waving at ungainly angles as he semaphored
his warning.</p>

<p>Hamilton opened his notebook and jotted down the
message&mdash;</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, dear old officer," he spelt, and grinned at the
unnecessary exertion of this fine preliminary flourish, "but must
keep you away. Bad outbreak of virulent smallpox&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sanders whistled, and pulled back the handle of the engine-room
telegraph to "stop."</p>

<p>"My God!" said Hamilton through his teeth, for he had seen such
an outbreak once, and knew something of its horrors. Whole
districts had been devastated in a night. One tribe had been wiped
out, and the rotting frames of their houses still showed amidst the
tangle of elephant grass which had grown up through the ruins.</p>

<p>He wiped his forehead and read the message a little unsteadily,
for his mind was on his sister&mdash;"Had devil of fight, and lost
twenty men, but got it under. Come and get me in three weeks. Had
to stay here for fear of careless devils spreading disease."</p>

<p>Sanders looked at Hamilton, and McMasters chuckled.</p>

<p>"This is where I get a swift vacation," he said, and called his
servant.</p>

<p>Hamilton leapt on to the rail, and steadying himself against a
stanchion, waved a reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are sending you a doctor."</p>

<p>Back came the reply in agitated sweeps of arm&mdash;"Doctor be
blowed! What am I?"</p>

<p>"What shall I say, sir?" asked Hamilton after he had delivered
the message.</p>

<p>"Just say 'a hero'." said Sanders huskily.</p>

</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 45, Dec
1916, pp 126-133</h3>

<p class="first">PATRICIA HAMILTON, an observant young lady, had
not failed to notice that every day, at a certain hour, Bones,
disappeared from view. It was not for a long time that she sought
an explanation.</p>

<p>"Where is Bones?" she asked one morning, when the absence of her
cavalier was unusually protracted.</p>

<p>"With his baby," said her brother.</p>

<p>"Please don't be comic, dear. Where is Bones? I thought I saw
him with the ship's doctor."</p>

<p>The mail had come in that morning, and the captain and surgeon
of the SS Boma Queen had been their guests at breakfast.</p>

<p>Hamilton looked up from his book and removed his pipe.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that Bones has kept his guilty secret
all this time?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>She sat down by his side.</p>

<p>"Please tell me the joke. This isn't the first time you have
ragged Bones about 'the baby'; even Mr. Sanders has done it."</p>

<p>Sho looked across at the Commissioner with a reproving shake of
her pretty head.</p>

<p>"Have I ragged Bones?" asked Sanders, in surprise. "I never
thought I was capable of ragging anybody."</p>

<p>"The truth is, Pat," said her brother, "there isn't any rag
about the matter. Bones adopted a piccanin."</p>

<p>"A child?"</p>

<p>"A baby about a month old. Its mother died, and some old bird of
a witch-doctor was 'chopping' it when Bones appeared on the
scene."</p>

<p>Patricia gave a little gurgle of delight and clapped her hands.
"Oh, please tell me everything about it."</p>

<p>It was Sanders who told her of Henry Hamilton Bones, his dire
peril and his rescue; it was Hamilton who embellished the story of
how Bones had given his adopted son his first bath.</p>

<p>"Just dropped him into a tub and stirred him round with a
mop."</p>

<p>Soon after this Bones came blithely up from the beach and across
the parade-ground, his large pipe in his mouth, his cane
awhirl.</p>

<p>Hamilton watched him from the verandah of the Residency, and
called over his shoulder to Patricia.</p>

<p>It had been an anxious morning for Bones, and even Hamilton was
compelled to confess to himself that he had felt the strain, though
he had not mentioned the fact to his sister.</p>

<p>Outside in the roadstead the intermediate Elder Dempster boat
was waiting the return of the doctor. Bones had been to see him
off. An important day, indeed, for Henry Hamilton Bones had been
vaccinated.</p>

<p>"I think it 'took,'" said Bones gravely, answering the other's
question. "I must say Henry behaved like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"What did Fitz say?"</p>

<p>(Fitzgerald, the doctor, had come in accordance with his promise
to perform the operation.)</p>

<p>"Fitz?" said Bones, and his voice trembled. "Fitz is a cad!"</p>

<p>Hamilton grinned.</p>

<p>"He said that babies didn't feel pain, and there was Henry
howling his young head off. It was horrible!"</p>

<p>Bones wiped his streaming brow with a large and violent bandana,
and looked round cautiously.</p>

<p>"Not a word, Ham, to her!" he said, in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" said Hamilton, picking up his pipe. "Her knows."</p>

<p>"Good gad!" said Bones, in despair, and turned to meet the
girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bones!" she said reproachfully, "You never told me!"</p>

<p>Bones shrugged his shoulders, opened his mouth, dropped his
pipe, blinked, spread out his hands in deprecation, and picked up
his pipe.</p>

<p>From which it may be gathered that he was agitated.</p>

<p>"Dear old Miss Hamilton," he said tremulously, "I should be a
horrid bounder if I denied Henry Hamilton Bones&mdash;poor little
chap. If I never mentioned him, dear old sister, it is
because&mdash;Ah, well, you will never understand."</p>

<p>He hunched his shoulders dejectedly.</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Bones. Why the dickens are you making a
mystery of the thing?" asked Hamilton. "I'll certify you're a jolly
good father to the brat."</p>

<p>"Not 'brat,' dear old sir," begged Bones. "Henry is a human
being with a human heart. That boy"&mdash;he wagged his finger
solemnly&mdash;"knows me the moment I go into the hut. To see him
sit up an' say 'Da!' dear old sister Hamilton," he went on
incoherently, "to see him open his mouth with a smile, one tooth
through, an' one you can feel with your little finger&mdash;why,
it's&mdash;it's wonderful, jolly old Miss Hamilton! Damn it, it's
wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Bones!" cried the shocked girl.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, madame," said Bones miserably. "Fitz cut his
poor little, fat little arm. Oh, Fitz is a low cad! Cut it, my dear
old Patricia, mercilessly&mdash;yes, mercilessly, brutally, an' the
precious little blighter didn't so much as call for the police.
Good gad, it was terrible!"</p>

<p>His eyes were moist, and he blew his nose with great vigour.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was awful," she soothed him. "May I come and see
him?"</p>

<p>Bones raised a warning hand, and, though the habitat of the
wonderful child could not have been less than half a mile away,
lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"He's asleep&mdash;fitfully, but asleep. I've told them to call
me if he has a turn for the worse, an' I'm goin' down with a
gramophone after dinner, in case the old fellow wants buckin' up.
But now he's asleep, thankin' you for your great kindness an'
sympathy, dear old miss, in the moment of singular trial."</p>

<p>He took her hand and shook it heartily, tried to say something,
and swallowed hard, then, turning, walked from the verandah in the
direction of his hut.</p>

<p>The girl was smiling, but there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What a boy! " she said, half to herself.</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"Bones is very nice," he said, and she looked at him
curiously.</p>

<p>"That is most eloquent," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"I thought it was rather bald," he replied. "You see, few people
really understand Bones. I thought, the first time I saw him, that
he was a fool. I was wrong. Then I thought he was effeminate. I was
wrong again, for he has played the man whenever he was called upon
to do so. Bones is one of those rare creatures&mdash;a man with all
the moral equipment of a good woman."</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on his, and for a moment they held. Then her
eyes dropped quickly, and she flushed ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"I think you have defined the perfect man," she said, turning
the leaves of her book.</p>

<p>The next morning she was admitted to an audience with that
paragon of paragons, Henry Hamilton Bones.</p>

<p>He lived in the largest of the Houssa huts at the far end of the
lines, and had for attendants two native women, for whom Bones had
framed the most stringent and regimental of orders.</p>

<p>The girl paused in the porch of the hut to read the typewritten
regulations which were fastened by drawing-pins to a green baize
board.</p>

<p>They were bi-lingual, being in English and in coast Arabic, in
which dialect Bones was something of a master. The girl wondered
why they should be in English.</p>

<p>"Absolutely necessary, dear old lady friend," explained Bones
firmly. "You've no idea what a lot of anxiety I have had. Your dear
old brother&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;is a topping old sport, but
with children you can't be too careful, and Ham is awfully
thoughtless. There, I've said it!"</p>

<p>The English part of the regulations was brief, and she read it
through.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>"All based on my personal observation and experience," said
Bones triumphantly&mdash;"not a single tip from anybody."</p>

<p>"I think you are really marvellous, Bones," said the girl, and
meant it.</p>

<p>Henry Hamilton Bones sat upright in a wooden cot. A fat-faced
atom of brown humanity, bald-headed and big-eyed, he sucked his
thumb and stared at the visitor, and from the visitor to Bones.</p>

<p>Bones he regarded with an intelligent interest which dissolved
into a fat chuckle of sheer delight.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"Isn't it&mdash;isn't it simply extraordinary?" demanded Bones
ecstatically. "In all your long an' painful experience, dear old
friend an' co-worker, have you ever seen anything like it? When you
remember that babies don't open their eyes until three weeks after
they're born&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Da!" said Henry Hamilton Bones.</p>

<p>"Da yourself, Henry!" squawked his foster-father.</p>

<p>"Do da!" said Henry.</p>

<p>The smile vanished from Bones's face, and he bit his lip
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Do da!" he repeated. "Let me see, what is 'do da'?"</p>

<p>"Do da!" roared Henry.</p>

<p>"Dear old Miss Hamilton," he said gently, "I don't know whether
Henry wants a drink or whether he has a pain in his stomach, but I
think that we had better leave him in more experienced hands."</p>

<p>He nodded fiercely to the native woman nurse and made his
exit.</p>

<p>Outside they heard Henry's hearty yell, and Bones put his hand
to his ear and listened with a strained expression on his face.</p>

<p>Presently the tension passed.</p>

<p>"It was a drink," said Bones. "Excuse me whilst I make a note."
He pulled out his pocket-book and wrote:</p>

<p>"'Do da ' means 'child wants drink.'"</p>

<p>He walked back to the Residency with her, giving her a
remarkable insight into Henry's vocabulary. It appeared that babies
have a language of their own, which Bones boasted that he had
almost mastered.</p>

<p>She lay awake for a very long time that night, thinking of
Bones, his simplicity and his lovableness. She thought, too, of
Sanders, grave, aloof, and a little shy, and wondered...</p>

<p>She woke with a start, to hear the voice of Bones outside the
window. She felt sure that something had happened to Henry. Then
she heard Sanders and her brother speaking, and realized that it
was not Henry they were discussing.</p>

<p>She looked at her watch&mdash;it was three o'clock.</p>

<p>"I was foolish to trust that fellow," Sanders was saying, "and I
know that Bosambo is not to blame, because he has always given a
very wide berth to the Kulumbini people, though they live on his
border."</p>

<p>She heard him speak in a strange tongue to some unknown fourth,
and guessed that a spy of the Government had come in during the
night.</p>

<p>"We'll get away as quickly as we can, Bones," Sanders said. "We
can take our chance with the lower river in the dark; it will be
daylight before we reach the bad shoals. You need not come,
Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Do you think Bones will be able to do all you want?" Hamilton's
tone was dubious.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together, dear old officer," said Bones raising
his voice to an insubordinate pitch.</p>

<p>She heard the men move from the veranda, and fell asleep again,
wondering who was the man they spoke of and what mischief he had
been brewing.</p>

<p>On a little tributary stream, which is hidden by the island of
bats, was the village of Kulumbini. High elephant grass hid the
poor huts even from they who navigate a cautious way along the
centre of the narrow stream. On the shelving beach one battered old
canoe of ironwood, with its sides broken and rusted, the indolence
of its proprietor made plain by the badly spliced panels, was all
that told the stranger that the habitations of man were nigh.</p>

<p>Kulumbini was a term of reproach along the great river and
amongst the people of the Akasava, the Isisi, and the N'gombi, no
less than among that most tolerant of tribes the Ochori. They were
savage people, immensely brave, terrible in battle, but more
terrible after.</p>

<p>Kulumbini, the village and city of the tribe, was no more than
an outlier of a fairly important tribe which occupied forest land
stretching back to the Ochori boundary. Their territory knew no
frontier save the frontiers of caprice and desire. They had neither
nationality nor national ambition, and would sell their spears for
a bunch of fish, as the saying goes. Their one consuming passion
and one great wish was that they should not be overlooked, and, so
long as the tribes respected this eccentricity, the Kulumbini
distressed no man.</p>

<p>How this desire for isolation arose, none know. It is certain
that once upon a time they possessed a king who so shared their
views that he never came amongst them, but lived in a forest place
which is called to this day S'furi-S'foosi, "The trees (or glade)
of the distant king." They had demurred at Government inspection,
and Sanders, coming up the little river on the first of his visits,
was greeted by a shower of arrows, and his landing opposed by
locked shields.</p>

<p>There are many ways of disposing of opposition, not the least
important of which is to be found in two big brass-barrelled guns
which have their abiding place at each end of the Zaire's bridge.
There is also a method known as peaceful suasion. Sanders had
compromised by going ashore for a peace palaver with a revolver in
each hand.</p>

<p>He had a whole fund of Bomongo stories, most of which are unfit
for printing, but which, nevertheless, find favour amongst the
primitive humorists of the Great River. By parable and story, by
nonsense tale and romance, by drawing upon his imagination to
supply himself with facts, by invoking ju-jus, ghosts, devils, and
all the armoury of native superstition, he had, in those far-off
times, prevailed upon the people of Kulumbini not only to allow him
a peaceful entrance to their country, but&mdash;wonder of
wonders!&mdash;to contribute, when the moon and tide were in
certain relative positions, which in English means once every six
months, a certain tithe or tax, which might consist of rubber,
ivory, fish, or manioc, according to the circumstances of the
people.</p>

<p>More than this, he stamped a solemn treaty&mdash;he wrote it in
a tattered laundry-book which had come into the chief's possession
by some mysterious means&mdash;and he hung about the neck of
Gulabala, the titular lord of these strange people, the medal and
chain of chieftainship.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone in courtesy, the chief offered him the choice
of all the maidens of Kulumbini, and Sanders, to whom such offers
were by no means novel, had got out of a delicate situation in his
usual manner, having resort to witchcraft for the purpose. For he
said, with due solemnity and hushed breath, that it had been
predicted by a celebrated witch-doctor of the lower river that the
next wife he should take to himself would die of sickness mongo,
and said Sanders&mdash;</p>

<p>"My heart is too tender for your people, O Chief, to lead one of
your beautiful daughters to death."</p>

<p>"O Sandi," replied Gulabala hopefully, "I have many daughters,
and I should not miss one. And would it not be good service for a
woman of my house to die in your hut?"</p>

<p>"We see things differently, you and I," said Sanders, "for,
according to my religion, if any woman dies from witchcraft, her
ghost sits for ever at the foot of my bed, making terrifying
faces."</p>

<p>Thus Sanders had made his escape, and had received at odd
intervals the tribute of these remote people.</p>

<p>For years they had dwelt without interference, for they were an
unlucky people to quarrel with, and, save for one or two trespasses
on the part of Gulabala, there was no complaint made concerning
them. It is not natural, however, for native people to prosper, as
these folks did, without there growing up a desire to kill
somebody. For does not the river saying run: "The last measure of a
full granary is a measure of blood"?</p>

<p>In the dead of a night Gulabala took three hundred spears across
the frontier to the Ochori village of Netcka, and returned at dawn
with the spears all streaky. And he brought back with him some
twenty women, who would have sung the death-song of their men but
for the fact that Gulabala and his warriors beat them.</p>

<p>Gulabala slept all the day, he and his spears, and woke to a
grisly vision of consequence.</p>

<p>He called his people together and spoke in this wise&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soon Sandi and his headmen will come, and, if we are here,
there will be many folk hanged, for Sandi is a cruel man. Therefore
let us go to a far place in the forest, carrying our treasure, and
when Sandi has forgiven us, we will come back."</p>

<p>A good plan but for the sad fact that Bosambo of the Ochori was
less than fifty miles away at the dawn of that fatal day, and was
marching swiftly to avenge his losses, for not only had Gulabala
taken women, but he had taken sixty goats, and that was
unpardonable.</p>

<p>The scouts which Gulabala had sent out came back with the news
that the way to sanctuary was barred by Bosambo.</p>

<p>Now, of all the men that the Kulumbini hated, they hated none
more than the Chief of the Ochori. For he alone never scrupled to
overlook them, and to dare their anger by flogging such of them as
raided his territory in search of game.</p>

<p>"Ko," said Gulabala, deeply concerned, "this Bosambo is Sandi's
dog. Let us go back to our village and say we have been hunting,
for Bosambo will not cross into our lands for fear of Sandi's
anger."</p>

<p>They reached the village, and were preparing to remove the last
evidence of their crime&mdash;one goat looks very much like
another, but women can speak&mdash;when Sanders came striding down
the village street, and Gulabala, with his curved execution knife
in his hand, stood up by the side of the woman he had slain.</p>

<p>"O Gulabala," said Sanders softly, "this is an evil thing."</p>

<p>The chief looked left and right helplessly.</p>

<p>"Lord," he spoke huskily, "Bosambo and his people put me to
shame, for they spied on me and overlooked me. And we are proud
people, who must not be overlooked&mdash;thus it has been for all
time."</p>

<p>Sanders pursed his lips and stared at the man.</p>

<p>"I see here a fine high tree," he said, "so high that he who
hangs from its top branch may say that no man overlooks him. There
you shall hang, Gulabala, for your proud men to see, before they
also go to work for my King, with chains upon their legs as long as
they live."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Gulabala philosophically, "I have lived."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he went the swift way which bad chiefs go, and
his people were unresentful spectators.</p>

<p>"This is the tenth time I have had to find a new chief in this
belt," said Sanders, pacing the deck of the Zaire, "and who on
earth I am to put in his place I do not know."</p>

<p>The lokalis of the Kolumbini were already calling headmen to
grand palaver. In the shade of the reed-thatched lokali house,
before the hollow length of tree-trunk, the player worked his flat
drumsticks of ironwood with amazing rapidity. The call trilled and
rumbled, rising and falling, now a patter of light musical sound,
now a low grumble.</p>

<p>Bosambo came&mdash;by the river route&mdash;as Sanders was
leaving the Zaire to attend the momentous council.</p>

<p>"How say you, Bosambo&mdash;what man of the Kulumbini folk will
hold these people in check?"</p>

<p>Bosambo squatted at his lord's feet and set his spear
a-spinning.</p>

<p>"Lord," he confessed, "I know of none, for they are a strange
and hateful people. Whatever king you set above them they will
despise. Also they worship no gods or ghosts, nor have they ju-ju
or fetish. And, if a man does not believe, how may you believe him?
Lord, this I say to you&mdash;set me above the Kulumbini, and I
will change their hearts."</p>

<p>But Sanders shook his head.</p>

<p>"That may not be, Bosambo," he said.</p>

<p>The palaver was a long and weary one. There were twelve good
claimants for the vacant stool of office, and behind the twelve
there were kinsmen and spears.</p>

<p>From sunset to nigh on sunrise they debated the matter, and
Sanders sat patiently through it all, awake and alert. Whether this
might be said of Bones is questionable. Bones swears that he did
not sleep, and spent the night, chin in hand, turning over the
problem in his mind.</p>

<p>It is certain he was awake when Sanders gave his summing up,</p>

<p>"People of this land," said Sanders, "four fires have been burnt
since we met, and I have listened to all your words. Now, you know
how good it is that there should be one you call chief. Yet, if I
take you, M'loomo"&mdash;he turned to one sullen
claimant&mdash;"there will be war. And if I take B'songi, there
will be killing. And I have come to this mind&mdash;that I will
appoint a king over you who shall not dwell with you nor overlook
you."</p>

<p>Two hundred pairs of eyes watched the Commissioner's face. He
saw the gleam of satisfaction which came at this concession to the
traditional characteristic of the tribe, and went on, almost
completely sure of his ground.</p>

<p>"He shall dwell far away, and you, the twelve kinsmen of
Gulabala, shall reign in his place&mdash;one at every noon shall
sit in the chief's chair and keep the land for your king, who shall
dwell with me."</p>

<p>One of the prospective regents rose.</p>

<p>"Lord, that is good talk, for so did Sakalaba, the great king of
our race, live apart from us at S'furi-S'foosi, and were we not
prosperous in those days? Now tell us what man you will set over
us."</p>

<p>For one moment Sanders was nonplussed. He was rapidly reviewing
the qualifications of all the little chiefs, the headmen, and the
fisher leaders who sat under him, and none fulfilled his
requirements.</p>

<p>In that moment of silence an agitated voice whispered in his
ear, and Bones's lean hand clutched his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Sir an' Excellency," breathed Bones, all of a twitter, "don't
think I'm takin' advantage of my position, but it's the chance I've
been lookin' for, sir. You'd do me an awful favour&mdash;you see,
sir, I've got his career to consider&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;" began Sanders.</p>

<p>"Henry Hamilton Bones, sir," said Bones tremulously. "You'd set
him up for life, sir. I must think of the child, hang it all! I
know I'm a jolly old rotter to put my spoke in&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sanders gently released the frenzied grip of his lieutenant, and
faced the wondering palaver.</p>

<p>"Know all people that this day I give to you as king one whom
you shall call M'songuri, which means in your tongue 'The Young and
the Wise,' and who is called in my tongue N'risu M'ilitani
Tibbetti, and this one is a child and well beloved by my lord
Tibbetti, being to him as a son, and by M'ilitani and by me,
Sandi."</p>

<p>He raised his hand in challenge.</p>

<p>"Wa! Whose men are you?" he cried.</p>

<p>"M'songuri!"</p>

<p>The answer came in a deep-throated growl, and the assembly leapt
to its feet.</p>

<p>"Wa! Who rules this land?"</p>

<p>"M'songuri!"</p>

<p>They locked arms and stamped first with the right foot and then
with the left, in token of their acceptance.</p>

<p>"Take your king," said Sanders, "and build him a beautiful hut,
and his spirit shall dwell with you. This palaver is finished."</p>

<p>Bones was speechless all the way down river. At irregular
intervals he would grip Sanders's hand, but he was too full for
speech.</p>

<p>Hamilton and his sister met the law-givers on the quay.</p>

<p>"You're back sooner than I expected you, sir," said Hamilton.
"Did Bones behave?"</p>

<p>"Like a little gentleman," said Sanders.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bones," Patricia broke in eagerly, "Henry has cut another
tooth."</p>

<p>Bones's nod was grave and even distant.</p>

<p>"I will go and see His Majesty," he said. "I presume he is in
the palace?"</p>

<p>Hamilton stared after him.</p>

<p>"Surely," he asked irritably, "Bones isn't sickening for measles
again?"</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE TAMER OF
BEASTS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 45, Jan
1917, pp 207-212</h3>

<p class="first">NATIVE folk, at any rate, are but children of a
larger growth. In the main, their delinquencies may be classified
under the heading of "naughtiness." They are mischievous and
passionate, and they have a weakness for destroying things to
discover the secrets of volition. A too prosperous nation mystifies
less fortunate people, who demand of their elders and rulers some
solution of the mystery of their rivals' progress. Such a ruler,
unable to offer the necessary explanation, takes his spears to the
discovery, and sometimes discovers too much for his happiness.</p>

<p>The village of Jumburu stands on the edge of the bush country,
where the lawless men of all nations dwell. This territory is
filled with fierce communities, banded together against a common
enemy&mdash;the law. They call this land the B'wigini, which means
"the Nationless," and Jumburu's importance lies in the fact that it
is the outpost of order and discipline.</p>

<p>In Jumburu were two brothers, O'ka and B'suru, who had usurped
the chieftainship of their uncle, the very famous K'sungasa, "very
famous," since he had been in his time a man of remarkable gifts,
which he still retained to some extent, and in consequence enjoyed
what was left of life.</p>

<p>He was, by all accounts, as mad as a man could be, and in
circumstances less favourable to himself his concerned relatives
would have taken him a long journey into the forest he loved so
well, and they would have put out his eyes and left him to the
mercy of the beasts, such being the method of dealing with lunacy
amongst people who, all unknown to themselves, were eugenists of a
most inflexible kind.</p>

<p>But to leave K'sungasa to the beasts would have been equivalent
to delivering him to the care of his dearest friends, for he had an
affinity for the wild dwellers of the bush, and all his life he had
lived amongst them and loved them.</p>

<p>It is said that he could arrest the parrot in the air by a
"cl'k!" and could bring the bird screeching and fluttering to his
hand. He could call the shy little monkeys from the high branches
where they hid, and even the fiercest of buffaloes would at his
word come snuffling and nosing his brown arm.</p>

<p>So that, when he grew weak-minded, his relatives, after a long
palaver, decided that for once the time-honoured customs of the
land should be overridden, and since there was no other method of
treating the blind but that prescribed by precedent, he should be
allowed to live in a great hut at the edge of the village with his
birds and snakes and wild-cats, and that the direction of village
affairs should pass to his nephews.</p>

<p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders knew all this, but did nothing. His
task was to govern the territory, which meant to so direct affairs
that the territory governed itself. When the fate of K'sungasa was
in the balance, he sent word to the chief's nephews that he was
somewhere in the neighbourhood, and that the revival of the bad old
custom of blinding would be followed by the introduction of the bad
new custom of hanging; but this had less effect upon the council of
relatives&mdash;to whom Sanders's message was not
transmitted&mdash;than the strangest friendship which K'sungasa had
for the forest folk.</p>

<p>The nephews might have governed the village, exacted tribute,
apportioned fishing rights, and administered justice for all time,
but for the fact that there came a period of famine, when crops
were bad and fish was scarce, and when, remarkably enough, the
village of L'bini, distant no more than a few hours' paddling, had
by a curious coincident raised record crops, and had, moreover a
glut of fish in their waters.</p>

<p>There was the inevitable palaver and the inevitable solution.
O'ka and B'suru led ten canoes to the offending village,
slaughtered a few men and burnt a few huts. For two hours the
combatants pranced and yelled and thrust at one another amidst a
pandemonium of screaming women, and then Lieutenant Tibbetts
dropped from the clouds with a most substantial platoon of Houssas,
and there was a general sorting out.</p>

<p>Sanders held a court on one of the middle islands near the
Residency, and B'suru was sent to the Village of Irons for the term
of his natural life. O'ka, who had fled to the bush, escaped,
however, and with him a headman and a few followers.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, who had spent two profitable days in the
village of Jumburu, came back to the Residency a very thoughtful
young man.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Bones?" asked Captain Hamilton.</p>

<p>His sister smiled over her book, but offered no other
comment.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Pat?" demanded Hamilton sternly.</p>

<p>Sanders looked at the girl with a twinkle in his grey eyes, and
lit a cheroot. The relationships between Patricia Hamilton and
Bones were a source of constant joy to him. Taciturn and a thought
dour as he was, Pat would never have suspected the bubbling
laughter which arose behind that lean brown face, unmovable and, in
his moments of most intense enjoyment, expressionless.</p>

<p>"Bones and I have a feud," said the girl.</p>

<p>Sanders smiled.</p>

<p>"Not as violent a feud as O'ka and I have, I hope?" he said.</p>

<p>She frowned a little and looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"But you don't worry about the threats of the people you have
punished?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't punished O'ka," said Sanders, "and an expedition into
the bush would be too expensive an affair. He has apparently
settled with the B'wigini people. If they take up his feud, they
might give trouble. But what is your trouble with Bones?"</p>

<p>"You must ask him," she said.</p>

<p>Hamilton's opportunity came next day, when Bones applied for
leave.</p>

<p>"Leave?" said Captain Hamilton incredulously. "Leave, Bones?
What the dickens do you want leave for?"</p>

<p>Bones, standing as stiff as a ramrod before the office table at
which his superior sat, saluted.</p>

<p>"Urgent private affairs, sir," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"But you haven't any private affairs," protested Hamilton. "Your
life is an open book&mdash;you were bragging about that fact
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Sir and brother-officer," said Bones firmly, "a crisis has
arisen in my young life. My word, sir, has been called into doubt
by your jolly old sister. I desire to vindicate my honour, my
reputation, an' my veracity."</p>

<p>"Pat has been pulling your leg!" suggested Hamilton, but Bones
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nothin' so indelicate, sir. Your revered an' lovely
relative&mdash;God bless her jolly old heart!&mdash;expressed her
doubt in re leopards an' buffaloes. I'm goin' out, sir, into the
wilds&mdash;amidst dangers, Ham, old feller, that only seasoned
veterans like you an' me can imagine&mdash;to bring proof that I am
not only a sportsman, but a gentleman."</p>

<p>The timely arrival of Miss Patricia Hamilton, very beautiful in
dazzling white, with her solar helmet perched at an angle, smote
Bones to silence.</p>

<p>"What have you been saying to Bones?" asked Hamilton
severely.</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>They began and finished together.</p>

<p>"Bones, you're a tell-tale," accused the girl.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Bones recklessly. "Don't spare me. I'm a liar an'
a thief an' a murderer&mdash;don't mind me!"</p>

<p>"I simply said that I didn't believe he shot the
leopard&mdash;the one whose skin is in his hut."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Bones with heavy sarcasm, "I didn't shoot
it&mdash;oh, no! I froze it to death&mdash;I poisoned it!"</p>

<p>"But did you shoot it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Did I shoot it, dear old Ham?" asked Bones, with great
calmness.</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Hamilton innocently.</p>

<p>"Did I shoot at that leopard," Bones went on deliberately. "an'
was he found next mornin' cold and dead, with a smile on his
naughty old face?"</p>

<p>Hamilton nodded, and Bones faced the girl expectantly.</p>

<p>"Apologize, child." he said.</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," she replied, with some heat.
"Did Bones shoot the leopard?"</p>

<p>She appealed to her brother.</p>

<p>Hamilton looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"When the leopard was found&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, dear old sister," murmured Bones.</p>

<p>"When the leopard was found, with a spear in its
side&mdash;".</p>

<p>"Evidently done after death by a wanderin' cad of a native,"
interposed Bones hastily.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Bones," commanded the girl, and Bones shrugged his
shoulders and obeyed.</p>

<p>"When the leopard was found," continued Hamilton, "he was
certainly beyond human aid, and though no bullet mark was
discovered, Bones conclusively proved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, dear old officer," interrupted Bones. He had seen
out of the tail of his eye a majestic figure crossing the square.
"Will you allow me to produce scientific an' expert evidence?"</p>

<p>Hamilton assented gravely, and Bones went to the door of the
orderly room and roared a name.</p>

<p>"I shall produce," he said quietly, but firmly, "the evidence of
one who enjoyed the confidence of dear old Professor
What's-his-name, the eminent thingumy-ologist. Oh, Ali!"</p>

<p>Ali Abid, a solemn figure, salaamed in the doorway.</p>

<p>Not for nothing had he been factotum to a great bacteriologist
before the demise of his master had driven him to service with a
lieutenant of Houssas. His vocabulary smelt of the laboratory, his
English was pure, undefiled, and unusual.</p>

<p>"Ali, you remember my leopard?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, shaking his head, "who can forget?"</p>

<p>"Did I kill him, Ali?" asked Bones. "Tell the lady
everything."</p>

<p>Ali bowed to the girl.</p>

<p>"Miss or madame," he said, "the leopard (Felis pardus), a wild
beast of the Felidae family, is indigenous to forest territory. The
subject in question&mdash;to wit, the skin thereof exhibited by Sir
Bones&mdash;was particularly ferocious, and departed this life as a
result of hunting conducted by aforesaid. Examination of subject
after demise under most scientific scrutiny revealed that said
leopard (Felis pardus) suffered from weak heart, and primary cause
of death was diagnosed as shock occasioned by large 'bang' from Sir
Bones's rifle."</p>

<p>"What did I say?" asked Bones complacently.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," gasped the girl, "that you frightened
the leopard to death?"</p>

<p>Bones spread out his hands disparagingly.</p>

<p>"You have heard the evidence, dear old sister," he said; "there
is nothing to add."</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed until her grey eyes were
swimming in tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bones, you humbug!" she laughed.</p>

<p>Bones drew himself up more stiffly than ever, stuck his monocle
in his eye, and turned on his chief.</p>

<p>"Do I understand, sir," he said, "that my leave is granted?"</p>

<p>"Seven days," said Hamilton, and Bones swung round on his heel,
knocked over Hamilton's stationery rack, stumbled over a chair, and
strode gloomily from the hut.</p>

<p>When Patricia Hamilton woke the next morning, she found a note
pinned to her pillow.</p>

<p>We may gloss over the impropriety of the proceedings which led
to this phenomenon. Bones was an artist, and so small a matter as
the proprieties did not come into his calculations.</p>

<p>Patricia sat up in bed and read the letter.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear old friend and Doutting
Thos.</span>
</p>

<p>(Bones's spelling was always perfectly disgraceful)&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">When this reaches you, when this reaches you, I
shall be far, far away on my long and dangerous journey. I may not
come back, I may not come back, for I and a faithful servant are
about to penetrate to the lares of the wild beasts of the forest,
of the forest. I am determined to wipe out the reproach which you
have made. I will bring back, not a dead leppard, not a dead
leppard, but a live one, which I shall seeze with my own hands. I
may lose my life in this rash and hazardus enterprise, but at least
I shall vindycate my honour.&mdash;Farewell, dear old Patrisia.</p>

<p class="letter">Your friend, <span class="smcap">B</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>"Which proves," said Hamilton, when he was shown the letter,
"that Bones is learning to spell. It only seems yesterday when he
was spelling 'Hamilton' with three m's. By the way, how did you get
this letter?"</p>

<p>"I found it pinned to the door," said Patricia tactfully.</p>

<p>Bones went by the shortest route to Jumburu, and was received
without enthusiasm, for he had left a new chief to rule over a
people who were near enough to the B'wigini to resent overmuch
discipline. But his business was with K'sungasa, for the two days'
stay which Bones had made in the village, and all that he had
learnt of the old tamer, had been responsible for his reckless
promise to Patricia Hamilton.</p>

<p>He came at a critical moment, for K'sungasa, a thin and knobbly
old man, with dim eyes and an incessant chuckle, was very near his
end. He lay on a fine raised bed, a big yellow-eyed wild cat at his
feet, a monkey or two shivering by the bedside, and a sprawling
litter of kittens&mdash;to which the wild cat leapt in a tremble of
rage when Bones entered the hut&mdash;crawling in the sunlight
which flooded the hut.</p>

<p>"Lord Tibbetti," croaked the old man, "I see you! This is a good
time, for to-morrow I should be dead."</p>

<p>"K'sungasa," said Bones, seating himself gingerly, and looking
about for the snake which was usually coiled round the old man's
stool, "that is foolish talk, for you will see many floods."</p>

<p>"That is fine talk for the river folk," grinned the old man,
"but not for we people of the forest, who never see flood and only
little-little rivers. Now, I tell you, lord, that I am glad to die,
because I have been full of mad thoughts for a long time, but now
my mind is clear. Tell me, master, why you come."</p>

<p>Bones explained his errand, and the old man's eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>"Lord, if I could go with you to the forest, I would bring to
you many beautiful leopards by my magic. Now, because I love Sandi,
I will do this for you, so that you shall know how wise and cunning
I am."</p>

<p>In the woods about the village was a wild plant, the seeds of
which, when pounded and boiled in an earthern vessel, produced, by
a rough method of distillation, a most pungent liquid. Abid spoke
learnedly of <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>*, and probably he was
right.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Both anise and star anise (<i>Illicium
anisatum</i>) are to be found in the Territories, as also is a
small plant which has all the properties (and more) of
<i>Pimpinella anisum</i>. This was probably the
plant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author</span>.]</p>

<p>Bones and his assistant made many excursions into the woods
before they found and brought back the right plant. Fortunately it
was seed-time, and once he was on the right track Bones had no
difficulty in securing more than a sufficient quantity for his
purpose.</p>

<p>He made his distillation under the old man's directions, the
fire burning in the middle of the hut. As the drops began to fall
from the narrow neck of his retort, a faint sweet aroma filled the
hut. First the cat, then the monkeys began to show signs of
extraordinary agitation. Cat and kittens crouched as near the fire
as they could, their heads craned towards the brown vessel, mewing
and whimpering. Then the monkeys came, bright-eyed and eager.</p>

<p>The scent brought the most unexpected beasts from every hole and
crevice in the hut&mdash;brown rats, squirrels, a long black snake
with spade-shaped head and diamond markings, little bush hares, a
young buck, which came crashing through the forest and prinked
timidly to the door of the hut.</p>

<p>The old man on the bed called them all by name, and snapped his
feeble fingers to them; but their eyes were on the retort and the
crystal drops that trembled and fell from the lip of the narrow
spout.</p>

<p>A week later a speechless group stood before the Residency and
focused their astonished gaze upon the miracle.</p>

<p>"The miracle" was a half-grown leopard cub, vividly marked. He
was muzzled and held in leash by a chain affixed to a stout collar,
and Bones, a picture of smug gratification, held the end of the
chain.</p>

<p><a id="pic7" name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a>
</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src="0600061h-images/A06-Pic07.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>"But how&mdash;how did you catch him?" gasped the girl.</p>

<p>Bones shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is not for me, dear old friend, to tell of nights spent in
the howlin' forest," he quavered, in the squeaky tone which
invariably came to him when he was excited. "I'm not goin' to speak
of myself. If you expect me to tell you how I trailed the jolly old
leopard to his grisly lair an' fought with him single-handed,
you'll be disappointed."</p>

<p>"But did you track him to his lair?" demanded Hamilton,
recovering his speech.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, dear old officer, to discuss other matters,"
evaded Bones tactfully. "Here are the goods delivered, as per mine
of the twenty-fourth instant."</p>

<p>He put his hand to his pocket mechanically, and the cub looked
up with a quick eager stare.</p>

<p>"Bones, you're a wonderful fellow," said Sanders quietly.</p>

<p>Bones bowed.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "if you'll excuse me, I'll take my little
friend to his new home."</p>

<p>Before they realized what he was doing, he had slipped off the
chain. Even Sanders stepped back and dropped his hand to the
automatic pistol he carried in his hip pocket.</p>

<p>But Bones, unconcerned, whistled and marched off to his hut, and
the great cat followed humbly at his heels.</p>

<p>That same night Bones strode across from his hut to the
Residency, resolved upon a greater adventure yet. He would go out
under the admiring eyes of Patricia Hamilton, and would return from
the Residency woods a veritable Pied Piper, followed by a trail of
forest denizens.</p>

<p>In his pocket was a quart bottle, and his clothes reeked with
the scent of wild aniseed. As a matter of fact, his secret would
have been out the moment he entered Sanders's dining-room, but it
so happened that his programme was doomed to interruption.</p>

<p>He was half-way across the square when a dark figure rose from
the ground and a harsh voice grunted "Kill!"</p>

<p>He saw the flash of the spear in the starlight and leapt aside.
A hand clutched at his jacket, but he wrenched himself free,
leaving the garment in his assailant's hands.</p>

<p>He was unarmed, and there was nothing left but flight.</p>

<p>Sanders heard his yell, and sprang out to the darkness of the
verandah as Bones flew up the steps.</p>

<p>He saw the two men racing in pursuit, and fired twice. One man
fell, the other swerved and was lost in the shadows.</p>

<p>An answering shot came from the Houssa sentry at the far end of
the square. Sanders saw a man running, and fired again, and again
missed.</p>

<p>Then out of the darkness blundered Ali Abid, his face grey with
fear.</p>

<p>"Sir, he gasped, "wild animal (Felis pardus) has divested
muzzlement and proper restraint, and is chasing various subjects
outrageously."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke a fourth figure sped across the ground before
the Residency, so close that they could see the bundle he carried
under his arm.</p>

<p>"My jacket!" roared Bones. "Hi, stop him! Good Lord!"</p>

<p>Swift on the heels of the flying man came a streak of yellow
fur...</p>

<p>Whether O'ka of the Jumburu outpaced the leopard, or the leopard
overtook O'ka, is not known, but until the rains came and washed
away the scent of crude aniseed, Bones dared not leave his hut by
night for fear of the strange beasts that came snuffling at his
hut, or sat in expectant and watchful circles about his dwelling,
howling dismally.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE MERCENARIES</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 45, Feb
1917, pp 355-362</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was a large brown desk in Sanders's study, a
desk the edges of which had been worn yellow with constant rubbing.
It was a very tidy desk, with two rows of books neatly grouped on
the left and on the right, and held in place by brass rails. There
were three tiers of wire baskets, a great white blotting-pad, a
silver inkstand and four clean-looking pens.</p>

<p>Lately, there had appeared a glass vase filled with flowers
which were daily renewed. Except on certain solemn occasions, none
intruded into this holy of holies. It is true that a change had
been brought about by the arrival of Patricia Hamilton, for she had
been accorded permission to use the study as she wished, and she it
was who had introduced the floral decorations.</p>

<p>Yet, such was the tradition of sanctuary which enveloped the
study, that neither Captain Hamilton, her brother, nor Bones, her
slave, had ever ventured to intrude thither in search of her, and
if by chance they came to the door to speak to her, they
unaccountably lowered their voices.</p>

<p>On a certain summer morning, Hamilton sat at the desk, a stern
and sober figure, and Bones, perspiring and rattled, sat on the
edge of a chair facing him.</p>

<p>The occasion was a solemn one, for Bones was undergoing his
examination in subjects "X" and "Y" for promotion to the rank of
Captain. The particular subject under discussion was "Map Reading
and Field Sketching," and the inquisition was an oral one.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Tibbetts," said Hamilton gravely, "you will please
define a Base Line."</p>

<p>Bones pushed back the hair straggling over his forehead, and
blinked rapidly in an effort of memory.</p>

<p>"A base line, dear old officer?" he repeated. "A base line, dear
old Ham&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Restrain your endearing terms," said Hamilton, "you won't get
any extra marks for 'em."</p>

<p>"A base line?" mused Bones; then, "Whoop! I've got it! God bless
your jolly old soul! I thought I'd foozled it. A base line," he
said loudly, "is the difference of level between two adjacent
contours. How's that, umpire?"</p>

<p>"Wrong," said Hamilton; "you're describing a Vertical
Interval."</p>

<p>Bones glared at him.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, dear old chap?" he demanded truculently. "Have a
look at the book, jolly old friend, your poor old eyes ain't what
they used to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Tibbetts," said Hamilton in ponderous reproof, "you
are behaving very strangely."</p>

<p>"Look here, dear old Ham," wheedled Bones, "can't you pretend
you asked me what a Vertical Interval was?"</p>

<p>Hamilton reached round to find something to throw, but this was
Sanders's study.</p>

<p>"You have a criminal mind, Bones," he said helplessly. Now get
on with it. What are 'Hachures'?"</p>

<p>"Hachures?" said Bones, shutting his eye. "Hachures? Now I know
what Hachures are. A lot of people would think they were chickens,
but I know... they're a sort of line... when you're drawing a
hill... wiggly-waggly lines... you know the funny things... a sort
of..." Bones made mysterious and erratic gestures in the air,
"shading... water, dear old friend."</p>

<p>"Are you feeling faint?" asked Hamilton, jumping up in
alarm.</p>

<p>"No, silly ass... shadings... direction of water&mdash;am I
right sir?"</p>

<p>"Not being a thought-reader I can't visualize your disordered
mind," said Hamilton, " but Hachures are the conventional method of
representing hill features by shading in short vertical lines to
indicate the slope and the water flow. I gather that you have a
hazy idea of what the answer should be."</p>

<p>"I thank you, dear old sir, for that generous tribute to my
grasp of military science," said Bones. "An' now proceed to the
next torture &mdash;which will you have, sir, rack or
thumbscrew?&mdash;oh, thank you, Horace, I'll have a glass of
boiling oil."</p>

<p>"Shut up talking to yourself," growled Hamilton, "and tell me
what is meant by 'Orienting a Map'?"</p>

<p>"Turning it to the east," said Bones promptly. "Next sir."</p>

<p>"What is meant by 'Orienting a Map'?" asked Hamilton
patiently.</p>

<p>"I've told you once," said Bones defiantly.</p>

<p>"Orienting a Map," said Hamilton, "as I have explained to you a
thousand times, means setting your map or plane-table so that the
north line lies north."</p>

<p>"In that case, sir," replied Bones firmly, "the east line would
be east, and I claim to have answered the question to your entire
satisfaction."</p>

<p>"Continue to claim," snarled Hamilton. "I shall mark you zero
for that answer."</p>

<p>"Make it one," pleaded Bones. "Be a sport, dear old
Ham&mdash;I've found a new fishin' pool."</p>

<p>Hamilton hesitated.</p>

<p>"There are never any fish in the pools you find," he said
dubiously. "Anyway, I'll reserve my decision until I've made a cast
or two."</p>

<p>They adjourned for tiffin soon after.</p>

<p>"How did you do, Bones?" asked Patricia Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Fine," said Bones enthusiastically; "I simply bowled over every
question that your dear old brother asked. In fact, Ham admitted
that I knew much more about some things than he did."</p>

<p>"What I said," corrected Hamilton, "was that your information on
certain subjects was so novel that I doubted whether even the staff
college shared it."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said Bones..</p>

<p>"You should try him on military history," suggested Sanders
dryly. "I've just been hearing from Bosambo&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bones coughed and blushed.</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir an' Excellency," he confessed, "I was
practisin' on Bosambo. You mightn't be aware of the fact, but I
like to hear myself speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" gasped Hamilton in amazement, "you're wronging yourself,
Bones!"</p>

<p>"What I mean, sir," Bones went on with dignity, "is that if I
lecture somebody on a subject I remember what I've said."</p>

<p>"Always providing that you understand what you're saying,"
suggested Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Sanders, with his quiet smile, "Bones has filled
Bosambo with a passionate desire to emulate Napoleon, and Bosambo
has been making tentative inquiries as to whether he can raise an
Old Guard or enlist a mercenary army."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself&mdash;" began Bones.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Hamilton, rising. "It's the only chance you'll
have of hearing something complimentary about yourself."</p>

<p>"I believe in you, Bones," said a smiling Patricia. "I think
you're really wonderful, and that Ham is a brute."</p>

<p>"I'll never, never contradict you, dear Miss Patricia," said
Bones; "an' after the jolly old Commissioner has gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not going away again, are you?" she asked, turning to
Sanders. "Why, you have only just come back from the interior."</p>

<p>There was genuine disappointment in her eyes, and Sanders
experienced a strange thrill the like of which he had never known
before.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a nod. "There is a palaver of sorts in the
Morjaba country&mdash;the most curious palaver I have ever been
called upon to hold."</p>

<p>And indeed he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Beyond the frontiers of the Akasava, and separated from all the
other Territories by a curious bush belt which ran almost in a
straight line for seventy miles, were the people of Morjaba. They
were a folk isolated from territorial life, and Sanders saw them
once every year and no more frequently, for they were difficult to
come by, regular payers of taxes and law-abiding, having quarrels
with none. The bush (reputedly the abode of ghosts) was, save at
one point, impenetrable. Nature had plaited a natural wall on one
side, and had given the tribe the protection of high mountains to
the north and a broad swamp to the west.</p>

<p>The fierce storms of passion and hate which burst upon the river
at intervals and sent thousands of spears to a blooding, were
scarcely echoed in this sanctuary-land. The marauders of the Great
King's country to the north never fetched across the smooth moraine
of the mountains, and the evil people of The-Land-beyond-the-Swamp
were held back by the treacherous bogland wherein, cala-cala, a
whole army had been swallowed up.</p>

<p>Thus protected, the Morjabian folk grew fat and rich. The land
was a veritable treasure of Nature, and it is a fact that in the
dialect they speak, there is no word which means "hunger."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[It is a curious a fact that amongst the
majority of cannibal people there is no equivalent for "thank
you."&mdash;<span class="smcap">E.W.</span>]</p>

<p>Yet the people of the Morjaba were not without their crises.</p>

<p>S'kobi, the stout chief, held a great court which was attended
by ten thousand people, for at that court was to be concluded for
ever the feud between the M'gimi and the M'joro&mdash;a feud which
went back for the greater part of fifty years.</p>

<p>The M'gimi were the traditional warrior tribe, the bearers of
arms, and, as their name ("The High Lookers") implied, the proudest
and most exclusive of the people. For every man was the descendant
of a chief, and it was "easier for fish to walk," as the saying
goes, than for a man of the M'joro ("The Diggers") to secure
admission to the caste. Three lateral cuts on either cheek was the
mark of the M'gimi&mdash;wounds made, upon the warrior's initiation
to the order, with the razor-edged blade of a killing-spear. They
lived apart in three camps to the number of six thousand men, and
for five years from the hour of their initiation they neither
married nor courted. The M'gimi turned their backs to women, and
did not suffer their presence in their camps. And if any man
departed from this austere rule he was taken to the Breaking Tree,
his four limbs were fractured, and he was hoisted to the lower
branches, between which a litter was swung, and his regiment sat
beneath the tree neither eating, drinking nor sleeping until he
died. Sometimes this was a matter of days. As for the woman who had
tempted his eye and his tongue, she was a witness.</p>

<p>Thus the M'gimi preserved their traditions of austerity. They
were famous walkers and jumpers. They threw heavy spears and fought
great sham-fights, and they did every violent exercise save till
the ground.</p>

<p>This was the sum and substance of the complaint which had at
last come to a head.</p>

<p>S'gono, the spokesman of The Diggers, was a headman of the inner
lands, and spoke with bitter prejudice, since his own son had been
rejected by the M'gimi captains as being unworthy.</p>

<p>"Shall we men dig and sow for such as these?" he asked. "Now
give a judgment, King! Every moon we must take the best of our
fruit and the finest of our fish. Also so many goats and so much
salt, and it is swallowed up."</p>

<p>"Yet if I send them away," said the king, "how shall I protect
this land against the warriors of the Akasava and the evil men of
the swamp? Also of the Ochori, who are four days' march across good
ground?"</p>

<p>"Lord King," said S'gono, "are there no M'gimi amongst us who
have passed from the camp and have their women and their children?
May not these take the spear again? And are not we M'joro folk men?
By my life! I will raise as many spears from The Diggers and
captain them with M'joro men&mdash;this I could do between the
moons and none would say that you were not protected. For we are
men as bold as they."</p>

<p>The king saw that the M'gimi party were in the minority.
Moreover, he had little sympathy with the warrior caste, for his
beginnings were basely rooted in the soil, and two of his sons had
no more than scraped into the M'gimi.</p>

<p>"This thing shall be done," said the king, and the roar of
approval which swept up the little hillock on which he sat was his
reward.</p>

<p>Sanders, learning something of these doings, had come in haste,
moving across the Lower Akasava by a short cut, risking the chagrin
of certain chiefs and friends who would be shocked and mortified by
his apparent lack of courtesy in missing the ceremonious call which
was their due.</p>

<p>But his business was very urgent otherwise he would not have
travelled by Nobolama&mdash;The River-that-comes-and goes.</p>

<p>He was fortunate in that he found deep water for the Wiggle as
far as the edge of this pleasant land. A two days' trek through the
forest brought him to the great city of Morjaba.</p>

<p>In all the Territories there was no such city as this, for it
stretched for miles on either hand, and indeed was one of the most
densely populated towns within a radius of five hundred miles.</p>

<p>S'kobi came waddling to meet his governor with maize, plucked in
haste from the gardens he passed, and salt, grabbed at the first
news of Sanders's arrival, in his big hands. These he extended as
he puffed to where Sanders sat at the edge of the city.</p>

<p>"Lord," he wheezed, "none came with news of this great honour,
or my young men would have met you, and my maidens would have
danced the road flat with their feet. Take!"</p>

<p>Sanders extended both palms and received the tribute of salt and
corn, and solemnly handed the crushed mess to his orderly.</p>

<br>

<p>"O S'kobi," he said, "I came swiftly to make a secret palaver
with you, and my time is short."</p>

<p>"Lord, I am your man," said S'kobi, and signalled his
councillors and elder men to a distance.</p>

<p>Sanders was in some difficulty to find a beginning.</p>

<p>"You know, S'kobi, that I love your people as my children," he
said, "for they are good folk who are faithful to government and do
ill to none."</p>

<p>"Wa!" said S'kobi.</p>

<p>"Also you know that spearmen and warriors I do not love, for
spears are war and warriors are great lovers of fighting."</p>

<p>"Lord, you speak the truth," said the other, nodding, "therefore
in this land I will have made a law that there shall be no spears,
save those which sleep in the shadow of my hut. Now well I know why
you have come to make this palaver, for you have heard with your
beautiful long ears that I have sent away my fighting
regiments."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded.</p>

<p>"You speak truly, my friend," he said, and S'kobi beamed.</p>

<p>"Six times a thousand spears I had&mdash;and, lord spears grow
no corn. Rather are they terrible eaters. And now I have sent them
to their villages, and at the next moon they should have burnt
their fine war-knives, but for a certain happening. We folk of
Morjaba have no enemies, and we do good to all. Moreover, lord, as
you know, we have amongst us many folk of the Isisi, of the Akasava
and the N'gombi, also men from the Great King's land beyond the
High Rocks, and the little folk from The-Land-beyond-the-Swamp.
Therefore, who shall attack us since we have kinsmen of all amongst
us?"</p>

<p>Sanders regarded the jovial king with a sad little smile.</p>

<p>"Have I done well by all men?" he asked quietly. "Have I not
governed the land so that punishment comes swiftly to those who
break the law? Yet, S'kobi, do not the Akasava and the Isisi, the
N'gombi and the Lower River folk take their spears against me? Now
I tell you this which I have discovered. In all beasts great and
little there are mothers who have young ones and fathers who fight
that none shall harass the mother."</p>

<p>"Lord, this is the way of life," said S'kobi.</p>

<p>"It is the way of the Bigger Life," said Sanders, "and greatly
the way of man-life. For the women bring children to the land and
the men sit with their spears ready to fight all who would injure
their women. And so long as life lasts, S'kobi, the women will bear
and the men will guard; it is the way of Nature, and you shall not
take from men the desire for slaughter until you have dried from
the hearts of women the yearning for children."</p>

<p>"Lord,"Said S'kobi, a fat man and easily puzzled, "what shall be
the answer to this strange riddle you set me?"</p>

<p>"Only this," said Sanders rising, "I wish peace in this land,
but there can be no peace between the leopard who has teeth and
claws and the rabbit who has neither tooth nor claw. Does the
leopard fight the lion or the lion the leopard? They live in peace,
for each is terrible in his way, and each fears the other. I tell
you this, that you live in love with your neighbours not because of
your kindness, but because of your spears. Call them back to your
city, S'kobi."</p>

<p>The chief's large face wrinkled in a frown.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "that cannot be, for these men have marched
away from my country to find a people who will feed them, for they
are too proud to dig the ground."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn!" said Sanders in despair, and went back the way he
came, feeling singularly helpless.</p>

<p>The Odyssey of the discarded army of the Morjaba has yet to be
written. Paradoxically enough, its primary mission was a peaceful
one, and when it found first the frontiers of the Akasava and then
the river borders of the Isis closed against it, it turned to the
north in an endeavour to find service under the Great King, beyond
the mountains. Here it was repulsed and its pacific intentions
scouted. The M'gimi formed a camp a day's march from the Ochori
border, and were on the thin line which separates unemployment from
anarchy when Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori, who had learnt of their
presence, came upon the scene.</p>

<p>Bosambo was a born politician. He had the sense of opportunity
and that strange haze of hopeful but indefinite purpose which is
the foundation of the successful poet and statesman, but which,
when unsuccessfully developed, is described as "temperament."</p>

<p>Bones, paying a business call upon the Ochori, found a new
township grown up on the forest side of the city. He also
discovered evidence of discontent in Bosambo's harassed people, who
had been called upon to provide fish and meal for the greater part
of six thousand men who were too proud to work.</p>

<p>"Master," said Bosambo, "I have often desired such an army as
this, for my Ochori fighters are few. Now, lord, with these men I
can hold the Upper River for your King and Sandi, and none dare
speak against him. Thus would N'poloyani, who is your good friend,
have done."</p>

<p>"But who shall feed these men, Bosambo?" demanded Bones
hastily.</p>

<p>"All things are with God," replied Bosambo piously.</p>

<p>Bones collected all the available information upon the matter
and took it back to headquarters.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Sanders when he had concluded his recital, "if it
had been any other man but Bosambo... you would require another
battalion, Hamilton."</p>

<p>"But what has Bosambo done?" asked Patricia Hamilton, admitted
to the council.</p>

<p>"He is being Napoleonic," said Sanders, with a glance at the
youthful authority on military history, and Bones squirmed and made
strange noises. "We will see how it works out. How on earth is he
going to feed them, Bones?"</p>

<p>"Exactly the question I asked, sir an' Excellency," said Bones
in triumph. "'Why, you silly old ass&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" exclaimed the startled Sanders.</p>

<p>"That is what I said to Bosambo, sir," explained Bones hastily.
"'Why, you silly old ass,' I said, ' how are you goin' to grub
'em?' 'Lord Bones,' said Bosambo, 'that's the jolly old problem
that I'm workin' out.' "</p>

<p>How Bosambo worked out his problem may be gathered.</p>

<p>"There is some talk of an Akasava rising," said Sanders at
breakfast one morning. "I don't know why this should be, for my
information is that the Akasava folk are fairly placid."</p>

<p>"Where does the news come from, sir?" asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>"From the Isisi king&mdash;he's in a devil of a funk, and has
begged Bosambo to send him help."</p>

<p>That help was forthcoming in the shape of Bosambo's new army,
which arrived on the outskirts of the Isisi city and sat in
idleness for a month, at the end of which time the people of the
Isisi represented to their king that they would, on the whole,
prefer war to a peace which put them on half rations in order that
six thousand proud warriors might live on the fat of the land.</p>

<p>The M'gimi warriors marched back to the Ochori, each man
carrying a month's supply of maize and salt, wrung from the
resentful peasants of the Isisi.</p>

<p>Three weeks after, Bosambo sent an envoy to the King of the
Akasava.</p>

<p>"Let no man know this, Gubara, lest it come to the ears of
Sandi, and you, who are very innocent, be wrongly blamed," said the
envoy solemnly. "This says Bosambo: It has come to my ears that the
N'gombi are secretly arming and will very soon send a forest of
spears against the Akasava. Say this to Gubara, that because my
stomach is filled with sorrow I will help him. Because I am. very
powerful, because of my friendship with Bonesi and his cousin,
N'poloyani, who is also married to Bonesi's aunt, I have a great
army which I will send to the Akasava, and when the N'gombi hear of
this they will send away their spears and there will be peace."</p>

<p>The Akasava chief, a nervous man with the memory of all the
discomforts which follow tribal wars, eagerly assented. For two
months Bosambo's army sat down like a cloud of locusts and ate the
Akasava to a condition bordering upon famine.</p>

<p>At the end of that time they marched to the N'gombi country,
news having been brought by Bosambo's messengers that the Great
King was crossing the western mountains with a terrible army to
seize the N'gombi forests. How long this novel method of
provisioning his army might have continued may only be guessed, for
in the midst of Bosambo's plans for maintaining an army at the
expense of his neighbours there was a great happening in the
Morjaba country.</p>

<p>S'kobi, the fat chief, had watched the departure of his warriors
with something like relief. He was gratified, moreover
(native-like), by the fact that he had confounded Sanders. But when
the Commissioner had gone and S'kobi remembered all that he had
said, a great doubt settled like a pall upon his mind. For three
days he sat, a dejected figure, on the high carved stool of state
before his house, and at the end of that time he summoned S'gono,
the M'joro.</p>

<p>"S'gono," said he, "I am troubled in my stomach because of
certain things which our lord Sandi has said."</p>

<p>Thereupon he told the plebeian councillor much of what Sanders
had said.</p>

<p>"And now my M'gimi are with Bosambo of the Ochori, and he sells
them to this people and that for so much treasure and food."</p>

<p>"Lord," said S'gono, "is my word nothing? Did I not say that I
would raise spears more wonderful than the M'gimi? Give me leave,
King, and you shall find an army that shall grow in a night. I,
S'gono, son of Mocharlabili Yoka, say this!"</p>

<p>So messengers went forth to all the villages of the Morjaba
calling the young men to the King's hut, and on the third week
there stood on a plateau beneath the king's palaver house a most
wonderful host.</p>

<p>"Let them march across the plain and make the Dance of Killing,"
said the satisfied king, and S'gono hesitated.</p>

<p>"Lord King," he pleaded, "these are new soldiers, and they are
not yet wise in the ways of warriors. Also they will not take the
chiefs I gave them, but have chosen their own, so that each company
have two leaders who say evil things of one another."</p>

<p>S'kobi opened his round eyes.</p>

<p>"The M'gimi did not do this," he said dubiously, "for when their
captains spoke they leapt first with one leg and then with the
other, which was beautiful to see and very terrifying to our
enemies."</p>

<p>"Lord," begged the agitated S'gono, "give me the space of a moon
and they shall leap with both legs and dance in a most curious
manner."</p>

<p>A spy retailed this promise to a certain giant chief of the
Great King who was sitting on the Morjaba slopes of the mountains
with four thousand spears, awaiting a favourable moment to ford the
river which separated him from the rich lands of the northern
Morjaba.</p>

<p>This giant heard the tidings with interest.</p>

<p>"Soon they shall leap without heads," he said, "for without the
M'gimi they are little children. For twenty seasons we have waited,
and now comes our fine night. Go you, B'furo, to the Chief of
The-Folk-beyond-the-Swamp and tell him that when he sees three
fires on this mountain he shall attack across the swamp by the road
which he knows."</p>

<p>It was a well-planned campaign which the Great King's generals
and the Chief of The-People-beyond-the-Marsh had organized. With
the passing of the warrior caste the enemies of the Morjaba had
moved swiftly. The path across the swamp had been known for years,
but the M'gimi had had one of their camps so situated that no enemy
could debouch across, and had so ordered their dispositions that
the northern river boundary was automatically safeguarded.</p>

<p>Now S'gono was a man of the fields, a grower and seller of maize
and a breeder of goats. And he had planned his new army as he would
plan a new garden, on the basis that the nearer the army was to the
capital, the easier it was to maintain. In consequence the
river-ford was unguarded, and there were two thousand spears across
the marshes before a scared minister of war apprehended any
danger.</p>

<p>He flung his new troops against the Great King's chief captain
in a desperate attempt to hold back the principal invader. At the
same time, more by luck than good generalship, he pushed the evil
people of the marsh back to their native element. For two days the
Morjaba fought desperately if unskilfully against the seasoned
troops of the Great King, while messengers hurried east and south,
seeking help.</p>

<p>Bosambo's intelligence department may have shown' remarkable
prescience in unearthing the plot against the peace and security of
the Morjaba, or it may have been (and this is Sanders's theory)
that Bosambo was on his way to the Morjaba with a cock and bull
story of imminent danger. He was on the frontier when the king's
messenger came, and Bosambo returned with the courier to treat in
person.</p>

<p>"Five thousand loads of corn I will give you, Bosambo," said the
king, "also a hundred bags of salt. Also two hundred women who
shall be slaves in your house."</p>

<p>There was some bargaining, for Bosambo had no need of slaves,
but urgently wanted goats. In the end he brought up his hirelings,
and the people of the Morjaba city literally fell on the necks of
the returned M'gimi.</p>

<p>The enemy had forced the northern defences and were half-way to
the city when the M'gimi fell upon their flank.</p>

<p>The giant chief of the Great King's army saw the ordered ranks
of the old army driving in his flank, and sent for his own
captain.</p>

<p>"Go swiftly to our lord, the King, and say that I am a dead
man."</p>

<p>He spoke no more than the truth, for he fell at the hand of
Bosambo, who made a mental resolve to increase his demand on the
herds of S'kobi in consequence.</p>

<p>For the greater part of a month Bosambo was a welcome visitor,
and at the end of that time he made his preparations to depart.</p>

<p>Carriers and herdsmen drove or portered his reward back to the
Ochori country, marching one day ahead of the main body.</p>

<p>The M'gimi were summoned for the march at dawn, but at dawn
Bosambo found himself alone on the plateau, save for the few Ochori
headmen who had accompanied him on his journey.</p>

<p>"Lord," said S'kobi, "my fine soldiers do not go with you, for I
have seen how wise is Sandi who is my father and my mother."</p>

<p>Bosambo choked, and as was usual in moments of intense emotion,
found refuge in English.</p>

<p>"Dam' nigger!" he said wrathfully, "I bring um army, I feed um,
I keep um proper&mdash;you pinch um! Black t'ief! Pig! You bad
feller! I speak you bad for N'poloyani&mdash;him fine feller."</p>

<p>"Lord," said the uncomprehending king, "I see that you are like
Sandi for you speak his tongue. He also said 'Dam' very loudly. I
think it is the word white folk say when they are happy."</p>

<p>Bosambo met Bones hurrying to the scene of the fighting, and
told his tale.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said in conclusion, "what was I to do, for you told
nothing of the ways of N'poloyani when his army was stolen from
him. Tell me now, Tibbetti, what this man would have done."</p>

<p>But Bones shook his head severely.</p>

<p>"This I cannot tell you, Bosambo," he said, "for if I do you
will tell others, and my lord N'poloyani will never forgive
me."</p>

<p class="first">UNEXPECTED things happen in the Territories which
Mr. Commissioner Sanders rules. As for example:</p>

<p>Bones had gone down to the beach to "take the mail." This
usually meant no more than receiving a mail-bag wildly flung from a
dancing surf-boat. On this occasion Bones was surprised to discover
that the boat had beached and had landed, not only the mail, but a
stranger with his baggage.</p>

<p>He was a clean-shaven, plump man, in spotless white, and he
greeted Bones with a friendly nod. "Morning!" he said. "I've got
your mail."</p>

<p>Bones extended his hand and took the bag without evidence of any
particular enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Sanders about?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanders is in residence, sir," said Bones, ponderously
polite.</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Show the way," he said briskly.</p>

<p>Bones looked at the new-comer from the ventilator of his pith
helmet to the soles of his pipe-clayed shoes. "Excuse me, dear old
sir," he said, "have I the honour of addressin' the Secretary of
State for War?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the other in surprise. "What made you think
that?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Bones, with rising wrath, "he's the only fellow
that needn't say 'please' to me."</p>

<p>The man roared with laughter. "Sorry," he said. "Please show me
the way."</p>

<p>"Follow me, sir," said Bones.</p>

<p>Sanders was not "in residence," being, in fact, inspecting some
recent&mdash;and native&mdash;repairs to the boilers of the
Zaire.</p>

<p>The stranger drew up a chair on the stoep without invitation and
seated himself. He looked around. Patricia Hamilton was at the far
end of the stoep, reading a book. She had glanced up just long
enough to note and wonder at the new arrival. "Deuced pretty girl
that," said the stranger, lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Bones.</p>

<p>"I say that is a deuced pretty girl," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"And you're a deuced brute, dear sir," said Bones, "but hitherto
I have not commented on the fact."</p>

<p>The man looked up quickly. "What are you here," he
asked&mdash;"a clerk or something?"</p>

<p>Bones did not so much as flush. "Oh, no," he said sweetly. "I am
an officer of Houssas-rank, lieutenant. My task is to tame the
uncivilized beast an' entertain the civilized pig with a selection
of music. Would you like to hear our gramophone?"</p>

<p>The new-comer frowned. What brilliant effort of persiflage was
to follow will never be known, for at that moment came Sanders.</p>

<p>The stranger rose and produced a pocket-book, from which he
extracted a card and a letter. "Good morning, Commissioner!" he
said. " My name's Corklan&mdash;P. T. Corklan of Corklan, Besset
and Lyons."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Sanders.</p>

<p>"I've got a letter for you," said the man.</p>

<p>Sanders took the note, opened it, and read. It bore the neat
signature of an Under-Secretary of State and the embossed heading
of the Extra-Territorial Office, and it commended Mr. P. T. Corklan
to Mr. Commissioner Sanders, and requested him to let Mr. Corklan
pass without let or hindrance through the Territories, and to
render him every assistance "compatible with exigencies of the
Service" in his "inquiries into sugar production from the sweet
potato."</p>

<p>"You should have taken this to the Administrator," said Sanders,
"and it should bear his signature."</p>

<p>"There's the letter," said the man shortly. "If that's not
enough, and the signature of the Secretary of State isn't
sufficient, I'm going straight back to England to tell him so."</p>

<p>"You may go to the devil and tell him so," said Sanders calmly;
"but you do not pass into these Territories until I have received
telegraphic authority from my chief. Bones, take this man to your
hut, and let your people do what they can for him." And he turned
and walked into the house.</p>

<p>"You shall hear about this," said Mr. Corklan, picking up his
baggage.</p>

<p>"This way, dear old pilgrim," said Bones.</p>

<p>"Who's going to carry my bag?"</p>

<p>"Your name escapes me," said Bones, "but, if you'll glance at
your visitin' card, you will find the name of the porter legibly
inscribed."</p>

<p>Sanders compressed the circumstances into a hundred-word
telegram worded in his own economical style.</p>

<p>It happened that the Administrator was away on a shooting trip,
and it was his cautious secretary who replied&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">ADMINISTRATION TO SANDERS.&mdash;DUPLICATE
AUTHORITY HERE. LET CORKLAN PROCEED AT OWN RISK. WARN HIM
DANGERS.</p>
<br>

<p>"You had better go along and tell him," said Sanders. "He can
leave at once, and the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Bones delivered the message. The man was sitting on his host's
bed, and the floor was covered with cigar ash. Worst abomination of
all, was a large bottle of whisky, which he had produced from one
of his bags, and a reeking glass, which he had produced from
Bones's sideboard.</p>

<p>"So I can go to-night, can I?" said Mr. Corklan. "That's all
right. Now, what about conveyance, hey?"</p>

<p>Bones had now reached the stage where he had ceased to be
annoyed, and when he found some interest in the situation.</p>

<p>"What sort of conveyance would you like, sir?" he asked
curiously.</p>

<p>(If you can imagine him pausing half a bar before every "sir,"
you may value its emphasis.)</p>

<p>"Isn't there a steamer I can have?" demanded the man. "Hasn't
Sanders got a Government steamer?"</p>

<p>"Pardon my swooning," said Bones, sinking into a chair.</p>

<p>"Well, how am I going to get up?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Are you a good swimmer?" demanded Bones innocently.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mr. Corklan," you aren't a bad fellow. I
rather like you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Bones simply.</p>

<p>"I rather like you," repeated Mr. Corklan. "You might give me a
little help."</p>

<p>"It is very unlikely that I shall," said Bones. "But produce
your proposition, dear old adventurer."</p>

<p>"That is just what I am," said the other. He bit off the end of
another cigar and lit it with the glowing butt of the old one. "I
have knocked about all over the world, and I have done everything.
I've now a chance of making a fortune. There is a tribe here called
the N'gombi. They live in a wonderful rubber country, and I am told
that they have got all the ivory in the world, and stacks of rubber
hidden away.</p>

<p>"Now, it is a fact,"&mdash;and Bones was surprised to hear it
related by the stranger&mdash;"that the N'gombi are great misers
and hoarders of elephant tusks. For hundreds of years they have
traded ivory and rubber, and every village has its secret
storehouse. The Government had tried for years to wheedle the
N'gombi into depositing their wealth in some State store, for
riches mean war sooner or later. They lived in great
forests&mdash;the word N'gombi means 'interior'&mdash;in lands full
of elephants and rich in rubber trees.</p>

<p>"You are a regular information bureau," said Bones admiringly.
"But what has this to do with your inquiry into the origin of the
candy tree?"</p>

<p>The man smoked in silence for awhile, then he pulled from his
pocket a big map. Again Bones was surprised, because the map he
produced was the official map of the Territories. He traced the
river with his fat forefinger.</p>

<p>"Here is the N'gombi country from the east bank of the Isisi,
and this is all forest, and a rubber tree to every ten square
yards."</p>

<p>"I haven't counted them," said Bones, "but I'll take your
word."</p>

<p>"Now, what does this mean?" Mr. Corklan indicated a twisting
line of dots and dashes which began at the junction of the Isisi
River and the Great River, and wound tortuously over five hundred
miles of country until it struck the Sigi River, which runs through
Spanish territory. "What is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That, or those," said Bones, "are the footprints of the mighty
swoozlum bird that barks with its eyes an' lives on buttered toast
an' hardware."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I know it is," said the man, looking up
and looking Bones straight in the eye&mdash;"it is one of those
secret rivers you are always finding in these 'wet' countries. The
natives tell you about 'em, but you never find 'em. They are rivers
that only exist about once in a blue moon, when the river is very
high and the rains are very heavy. Now, down in the Spanish
territory "&mdash;he touched Bones's knees with great
emphasis&mdash;"they tell me that their end of the secret river is
in flood."</p>

<p>"They will tell you anything in the Spanish territory," said
Bones pleasantly. "They'd tell you your jolly old fortune if you'd
cross their palms with silver."</p>

<p>"What about your end?" asked the man, ignoring the scepticism of
his host.</p>

<p>"Our end?" said Bones. "Well, you will find out for yourself.
I'd hate to disappoint you."</p>

<p>"Now how am I going up?" asked the man, after a pause.</p>

<p>"You can hire a canoe, and live on the land, unless you have
brought stores."</p>

<p>The man chuckled. "I've brought no stores. Here, I will show you
something," he said. "You are a very good fellow." He opened his
bag and took out a tight packet which looked like thin skins. There
must have been two or three hundred of the them. "That's my
speciality," he said. He nipped the string that tied them together,
stripped one off, and, putting his lips to one end, blew. The skin
swelled up like a toy balloon. "Do you know what that is?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say I do," said Bones.</p>

<p>"You have heard of Soemmering's process?"</p>

<p>Bones shook his head.</p>

<p>"Do you know what decimal 1986 signifies?"</p>

<p>"You've got me guessing, my lad," said Bones admiringly.</p>

<p>The other chuckled, threw the skins into his bag, and closed it
with a snap. "That's my little joke," he said. "All my friends tell
me it will be the death of me one of these days. I like to puzzle
people"&mdash;he smiled amiably and triumphantly in Bones's
face&mdash;"I like to tell them the truth in such a way they don't
understand it. If they understood it&mdash;Heaven's there'd be the
devil to pay!"</p>

<p>"You are an ingenious fellow," said Bones, "but I don't like
your face. You will forgive my frankness, dear old friend."</p>

<p>"Faces aren't fortunes," said the other complacently, "and I am
going out of this country with money sticking to me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you," said Bones, shaking his head; "I hate to
see fellows with illusions."</p>

<p>He reported all that occurred to the Commissioner, and Sanders
was a little worried.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what his game is," he said; "I'd stop him like a
shot, but I can't very well in the face of the Administrator's
wire. Anyway, he will get nothing out of the N'gombi. I've tried
every method to make the beggars bank their surpluses, and I have
failed."</p>

<p>"He has got to come back this way, at any rate," said Hamilton,
"and I cannot see that he will do much harm."</p>

<p>"What is the rest of his baggage like?"</p>

<p>"He has a case of things that look like concave copper plates,
sir," said Bones, "very thin copper, but copper. Then he has two or
three copper pipes, and that is about his outfit."</p>

<p>Mr. Corklan was evidently no stranger to the coast, and Bones,
who watched the man's canoe being loaded that afternoon, and heard
his fluent observations on the slackness of his paddlers, realized
that his acquaintance with Central Africa was an extensive one. He
cursed in Swahili and Portuguese, and his language was forcible and
impolite. "Well," he said at last, "I'll be getting along. I'll
make a fishing village for the night, and I ought to reach my
destination in a week. I shan't be seeing you again, so I'll say
good-bye."</p>

<p>"How do you suppose you're going to get out of the country?"
asked Bones curiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Corklan laughed. "So long!" he said.</p>

<p>"One moment, my dashin' old explorer," said Bones. "A little
formality&mdash;I want to see your trunks opened."</p>

<p>A look of suspicion dawned on the man's face. "What for?"</p>

<p>"A little formality, my jolly old hero," said Bones.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so before?" growled the man, and had his two
trunks landed. "I suppose you know you're exceeding your duty?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know&mdash;thanks for tellin' me," said Bones. "The
fact is, sir an' fellow-man, I'm the Custom House officer."</p>

<p>The man opened his bags, and Bones explored. He found three
bottles of whisky, and these he extracted.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" asked Mr. Corklan.</p>

<p>Bones answered him by breaking the bottles on a near-by
stone.</p>

<p>"Here, what the dickens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wine is a mocker," said Bones, "strong drink is ragin'. This is
what is termed in the land of Hope an' Glory a prohibition State,
an' I'm entitled to fine you five hundred of the brightest an' best
for attemptin' to smuggle intoxicants into our innocent
country."</p>

<p>Bones expected an outburst; instead, his speech evoked no more
than a snigger.</p>

<p>"You're funny," said the man.</p>

<p>"My friends tell me so," admitted Bones. "But there's nothin'
funny about drink. Acquainted as you are with the peculiar workin's
of the native psychology, dear sir, you will understand the
primitive cravin' of the untutored mind for the enemy that we put
in our mouths to steal away our silly old brains. I wish you 'bon
voyage.' "</p>

<p>"So long," said Mr. Corklan.</p>

<p>Bones went back to the Residency and made his report, and there,
for the time being, the matter ended. It was not unusual for
wandering scientists, manufacturers, and representatives of
shipping companies to arrive armed with letters of introduction or
command, and to be dispatched into the interior. These visits,
happily, were few and far between. On this occasion Sanders, being
uneasy, sent one of his spies to follow the adventurer, with orders
to report any extraordinary happening&mdash;a necessary step to
take, for the N'gombi, and especially the Inner N'gombi, are a
secretive people, and news from local sources is hard to come
by.</p>

<p>"I shall never be surprised to learn that a war has been going
on in the N'gombi for two months without our hearing a word about
it."</p>

<p>"If they fight amongst themselves&mdash;yes," said Captain
Hamilton; "if they fight outsiders, there will be plenty of bleats.
Why not send Bones to overlook his sugar experiments," he
added.</p>

<p>"Lets talk about something pleasant," said Bones hastily.</p>

<p>It was exactly three months later when he actually made the
trip.</p>

<p>"Take the Zaire up to the bend of the Isisi," said Sanders one
morning, at breakfast, "and find out what Ali Kano is
doing&mdash;the lazy beggar should have reported."</p>

<p>"Any news from the N'gombi?" asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Only roundabout stories of their industry. Apparently the sugar
merchant is making big experiments. He has set half the people
digging roots for him. Be ready to sail at dawn."</p>

<p>"Will it be a dangerous trip?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"No. Why?" smiled Sanders.</p>

<p>"Because I'd like to go. Oh, please, don't look so glum! Bones
is awfully good to me."</p>

<p>"Better than a jolly old brother," murmured Bones.</p>

<p>"H'm!" Sanders shook his head, and she appealed to her
brother.</p>

<p>"Please!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind your going," said Hamilton, "if only to look
after Bones."</p>

<p>"S-sh!" said Bones reproachfully.</p>

<p>"If you're keen on it, I don't see why you shouldn't&mdash;if
you had a chaperon."</p>

<p>"A chaperon!" sneered Bones. "Great Heavens! Do, old skipper,
pull yourself together. Open the jolly old window and give him air.
Feelin' better, sir?"</p>

<p>"A chaperon! How absurd!" cried the girl indignantly. "I'm old
enough to be Bones's mother! I'm nearly twenty&mdash;well, I'm
older than Bones, and I'm ever so much more capable of looking
after myself."</p>

<p>The end of it was that she went, with her Kano maid and with the
wife of Abiboo to cook for her. And in two days they came to the
bend of the river, and Bones pursued his inquiries for the missing
spy, but without success.</p>

<p>"But this I tell you, lord," said the little chief who acted as
Sanders's agent, "that there are strange things happening in the
N'gombi country, for all the people have gone mad, and are digging
up their teeth (tusks) and bringing them to a white man."</p>

<p>"This shall go to Sandi," said Bones, realizing the importance
of the news; and that same evening he turned the bow of the Zaire
down stream.</p>

<p>Thus said Wafa, the half-breed, for he was neither foreign Arab
nor native N'gombi, yet combined the cunning of both&mdash;"Soon we
shall see the puc-a-puc of Government turn from the crookedness of
the river, and I will go out and speak to our lord Tibbetti, who is
a very simple man, and like a child."</p>

<p>"O Wafa," said one of the group of armed men which stood
shivering on the beach in the cold hours of dawn, "may this be a
good palaver! As for me, my stomach is filled with tearfulness. Let
us all drink this magic water, for it gives us men courage."</p>

<p>"That you shall do when you have carried out all our master's
works," said Wafa, and added with confidence: "Have no fear, for
soon you shall see great wonders."</p>

<p>They heard the deep boom of the Zaire's siren signalling a
solitary and venturesome fisherman to quit the narrow fair-way, and
presently she came round the bend of the river, a dazzling white
craft, showering sparks from her two slender smoke-stacks and
leaving behind her twin cornucopias of grey smoke.</p>

<p>Wafa stepped into a canoe, and, seeing that the others were
preparing to follow him, he struck out swiftly, manoeuvring his
ironwood boat to the very waters from whence a scared fisherman was
frantically paddling.</p>

<p>"Go not there, foreigner," wailed the Isisi Stabber-of-Waters,
"for it is our lord Sandi, and his puc-a-puc has bellowed
terribly."</p>

<p>"Die you!" roared Wafa. "On the river bottom your body, son of a
fish and father of snakes!"</p>

<p>"O foreign frog!" came the shrill retort. "O poor man with two
men's wives! O goatless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wafa was too intent on his business to heed the rest. He struck
the water strongly with his broad paddles, and reached the centre
of the channel.</p>

<p>Bones of the Houssas put up his hand and jerked the rope of the
siren.</p>

<p>Whoo-oowooo-op!</p>

<p>"Bless his silly old head," said Bones fretfully, "the dashed
fellow will be run down!"</p>

<p>The girl was dusting Bones's cabin, and looked round. "What is
it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Bones made no reply. He gripped the telegraph handle and rung
the engines astern as Yoka, the steersman, spun the wheel.</p>

<p>Bump! Bump! Bumpity bump!</p>

<p>The steamer slowed and stopped, and the girl came out to the
bridge in alarm. The Zaire had struck a sandbank, and was stranded
high, if not dry.</p>

<p>"Bring that man on board," said the wrathful Bones. And they
hauled to his presence Wafa, who was neither Arab nor N'gombi, but
combined the vices of both.</p>

<p>"O man," said Bones, glaring at the offender through his
eyeglass, "what evil ju-ju sent you to stop my fine ship?" He spoke
in the Isisi dialect, and was surprised to be answered in coast
Arabic.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, unmoved by the wrath of his overlord, "I
come to make a great palaver concerning spirits and devils. Lord, I
have found a great magic."</p>

<p>Bones grinned, for he had that sense of humour which rises
superior to all other emotions. "Then you shall try your magic, my
man, and lift this ship to deep water."</p>

<p>Wafa was not at all embarrassed. "Lord, this is a greater magic,
for it concerns men, and brings to life the dead. For, lord, in
this forest is a wonderful tree. Behold!"</p>

<p>He took from his loose-rolled waistband a piece of wood. Bones
took it in his hand. It was the size of a corn cob, and had been
newly cut, so that the wood was moist with sap. Bones smelt it.
There was a faint odour of resin and camphor. Patricia Hamilton
smiled. It was so like Bones to be led astray by side issues.</p>

<p>"Where is the wonder, man, that you should drive my ship upon a
sandbank! And who are these?" Bones pointed to six canoes, filled
with men, approaching the Zaire. The man did not answer, but,
taking the wood from Bones's hand, pulled a knife from his belt and
whittled a shaving.</p>

<p>"Here, lord," he said, "is my fine magic. With this wood I can
do many miracles, such as making sick men strong and the strong
weak."</p>

<p>Bones heard the canoes bump against the side of the boat, but
his mind was occupied with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Thus do I make my magic, Tibbetti," droned Wafa.</p>

<p>He held the knife by the haft in the right hand, and the chip of
wood in his left. The point of the knife was towards the white
man's heart.</p>

<p>"Bones!" screamed the girl.</p>

<p>Bones jumped aside and struck out as the man lunged. His nobbly
fist caught Wafa under the jaw, and the man stumbled and fell. At
the same instant there was a yell from the lower deck, the sound of
scuffling and a shot.</p>

<p><a id="pic9" name="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a>
</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src="0600061h-images/A06-Pic09.jpg" alt=

</div>
<br>

<p>Bones jumped for the girl, thrust her into the cabin, sliding
the steel door behind him. His two revolvers hung at the head of
his bunk, and he slipped them out, gave a glance to see whether
they were loaded, and pushed the door.</p>

<p>"Shut the door after me," he breathed.</p>

<p>The bridge deck was deserted, and Bones raced down the ladder to
the iron deck. Two Houssas and half a dozen natives lay dead or
dying. The remainder of the soldiers were fighting desperately with
whatever weapons they found to their hands&mdash;for, with
characteristic carefulness, they had laid their rifles away in oil,
lest the river air rust them&mdash;and, save for the sentry, who
used a rifle common to all, they were unarmed.</p>

<p>"O dogs!" roared Bones.</p>

<p>The invaders turned and faced the long-barrelled Webleys, and
the fight was finished. Later, Wafa came to the bridge with bright
steel manacles on his wrist. His companions in the mad adventure
sat on the iron deck below, roped leg to leg, and listened with
philosophic calm as the Houssa sentry drew lurid pictures of the
fate which awaited them.</p>

<p>Bones sat in his deep chair, and the prisoner squatted before
him. "You shall tell my lord Sandi why you did this wickedness," he
said, "also, Wafa, what evil thought was in your mind."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Wafa cheerfully, "what good comes to me if I
speak?" Something about the man's demeanour struck Bones as
strange, and he rose and went close to him.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, with a tightened lip. "The palaver is
finished."</p>

<p>They led the man away, and the girl, who had been a spectator,
asked anxiously: "What is wrong, Bones?"</p>

<p>But the young man shook his head. "The breaking of all that
Sanders has worked for," he said bitterly, and the very absence of
levity in one whose heart was so young and gay struck a colder
chill to the girl's heart than the yells of the warring N'gombi.
For Sanders had a big place in Patricia Hamilton's life. In an hour
the Zaire was refloated, and was going at full speed down
stream.</p>

<p>Sanders held his court in the thatched palaver house between the
Houssa guard-room and the little stockade prison at the river's
edge&mdash;a prison hidden amidst the flowering shrubs and acacia
trees.</p>

<p>Wafa was the first to be examined. "Lord," he said, without
embarrassment, "I tell you this&mdash;that I will not speak of the
great wonders which lay in my heart unless you give me a book* that
I shall go free."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A written promise]</p>

<p>Sanders smiled unpleasantly. "By the Prophet, I say what is
true," he began confidentially; and Wafa winced at the oath, for he
knew that truth was coming, and truth of a disturbing character.
"In this land I govern millions of men," said Sanders, speaking
deliberately, "I and two white lords, I govern by fear, Wafa,
because there is no love in simple native men, save a love for
their own and their bellies."</p>

<p>"Lord, you speak truth," said Wafa, the superior Arab of him
responding to the confidence.</p>

<p>"Now, if you make to kill the lord Tibbetti," Sanders went on,
"and do your wickedness for secret reasons, must I not discover
what is that secret, lest it mean that I lose my hold upon the
lands I govern?"</p>

<p>"Lord, that is also true," said Wafa.</p>

<p>"For what is one life more or less," asked Sanders, "a suffering
smaller or greater by the side of my millions and their good?"</p>

<p>"Lord, you are Suliman," said Wafa eagerly. "Therefore, if you
let me go, who shall be the worse for it?"</p>

<p>Again Sanders smiled, that grim parting of lip to show his white
teeth. "Yet you may lie, and, if I let you go, I have neither the
truth nor your body. No. Wafa, you shall speak." He rose up from
his chair. "To-day you shall go to the Village of Irons," he said;
"to-morrow I will come to you, and you shall answer my questions.
And, if you will not speak, I shall light a little fire in your
chest, and that fire shall not go out except when the breath goes
from your body. This palaver is finished."</p>

<p>So they took Wafa away to the Village of Irons, where the evil
men of the Territories worked with chains about their ankles for
their many sins, and in the morning came Sanders.</p>

<p>"Speak, man," he said.</p>

<p>Wafa stared with an effort of defiance, but his face was
twitching, for he saw the soldiers driving pegs into the ground,
preparatory to staking him out. "I will speak the truth," he
said.</p>

<p>So they took him into a hut, and there Sanders sat with him
alone for half an hour; and when the Commissioner came out, his
face was drawn and grey. He beckoned to Hamilton, who came forward
and saluted. "We will get back to headquarters," he said shortly,
and they arrived two hours later.</p>

<p>Sanders sat in the little telegraph office, and the Morse
sounder rattled and clacked for half an hour. Other sounders were
at work elsewhere, delicate needles vacillated in cable offices,
and an Under-Secretary was brought from the House of Commons to the
bureau of the Prime Minister to answer a question.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon came the message Sanders
expected: "London says permit for Corklan forged. Arrest. Take
extremest steps. Deal drastically, ruthlessly. Holding in residence
three companies African Rifles and mountain battery support you.
Good luck. Administration."</p>

<p>Sanders came out of the office, and Bones met him.</p>

<p>"Men all aboard, sir," he reported.</p>

<p>"We'll go," said Sanders.</p>

<p>He met the girl half-way to the quay. "I know it is something
very serious," she said quietly; "you have all my thoughts." She
put both her hands in his, and he took them. Then, without a word,
he left her.</p>

<p>Mr. P. T. Corklan sat before his new hut in the village of
Fimini. In that hut&mdash;the greatest the N'gombi had ever
seen&mdash;were stored hundreds of packages all well wrapped and
sewn in native cloth.</p>

<p>He was not smoking a cigar, because his stock of cigars was
running short, but he was chewing a toothpick, for these at a
pinch, could be improvised. He called to his headman. "Wafa?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Lord, he will come, for he is very cunning," said the
headman.</p>

<p>Mr. Corklan grunted. He walked to the edge of the village, where
the ground sloped down to a strip of vivid green rushes. "Tell me,
how long will this river be full?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lord, for a moon."</p>

<p>Corklan nodded. Whilst the secret river ran, there was escape
for him, for its meandering course would bring him and his rich
cargo to Spanish territory and deep water.</p>

<p>His headman waited as though he had something to say. "Lord," he
said at last, "the chief of the N'coro village sends this night ten
great teeth and a pot."</p>

<p>Corklan nodded. "If we're here, we'll get 'em. I hope we shall
be gone."</p>

<p>And then the tragically unexpected happened. A man in white came
through the trees towards him, and behind was another white man and
a platoon of native soldiers.</p>

<p>"Trouble," said Corklan to himself, and thought the moment was
one which called for a cigar.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Sanders!" he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>Sanders eyed him in silence.</p>

<p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," said Corklan.</p>

<p>"Corklan, where is your still?" asked Sanders.</p>

<p>The plump man laughed. "You'll find it way back in the forest,"
he said, "and enough sweet potatoes to distil fifty gallons of
spirit&mdash;all proof, sir, decimal 1986 specific gravity water
extracted by Soemmering's method&mdash;in fact, as good as you
could get it in England."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded. "I remember now&mdash;you're the man that ran
the still in the Ashanti country, and got away with the
concession."</p>

<p>"That's me," said the other complacently. "P. T. Corklan&mdash;I
never assume an alias."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded again. "I came past villages," he said, "where
every man and almost every woman was drunk. I have seen villages
wiped out in drunken fights. I have seen a year's hard work ahead
of me. You have corrupted a province in a very short space of time,
and, as far as I can judge, you hoped to steal a Government ship
and get into neutral territory with the prize you have won by
your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enterprise," said Mr. Corklan obligingly. "You'll have to prove
that&mdash;about the ship. I am willing to stand any trial you
like. There's no law about prohibition&mdash;it's one you've made
yourself. I brought up the still&mdash;that's true&mdash;brought it
up in sections and fitted it. I've been distilling
spirits&mdash;that's true&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I also saw a faithful servant of Government, one Ali Kano,"
said Sanders, in a low voice. "He was lying on the bank of this
secret river of yours with two revolver bullets in him."</p>

<p>"The nigger was spying on me, and I shot him," explained
Corklan.</p>

<p>"I understand," said Sanders. And then, after a little pause:
"Will you be hung or shot?"</p>

<p>The cigar dropped from the man's mouth. "Hey?" he said hoarsely.
"You&mdash;you can't&mdash;do that&mdash;for making a drop of
liquor &mdash;for niggers!"</p>

<p>"For murdering a servant of the State," corrected Sanders. "But,
if it is any consolation to you, I will tell you that I would have
killed you, anyway."</p>

<p>It took Mr. Corklan an hour to make up his mind, and then he
chose rifles.</p>

<p>To-day the N'gombi point to a mound near the village of Fimini,
which they call by a name which means, "The Waters of Madness," and
it is believed to be haunted by devils.</p>

<p class="first">BONES," said Captain Hamilton, in despair, "you
will never be a Napoleon."</p>

<p>"Dear old sir and brother-officer," said Lieutenant Tibbetts,
"you are a jolly old pessimist."</p>

<p>Bones was by way of being examined in subjects C and D, for
promotion to captaincy, and Hamilton was the examining officer. By
all the rules and laws and strict regulations which govern military
examinations, Bones had not only failed, but he had seriously
jeopardized his right to his lieutenancy, if every man had his
due.</p>

<p>"Now let me put this," said Hamilton. "Suppose you were in
charge of a company of men, and you were attacked on three sides,
and you had a river behind you on the fourth side, and you found
things were going very hard against you. What would you do?"</p>

<p>"Dear old sir," said Bones thoughtfully, and screwing his face
into all manner of contortions in his effort to secure the right
answer, "I should go away and wet my heated brow in the purling
brook, then I'd take counsel with myself."</p>

<p>"You'd lose," said Hamilton, with a groan. "That's the last
person in the world you should go to for advice, Bones. Suppose,"
he said, in a last desperate effort to awaken a gleam of military
intelligence in his subordinate's mind, "suppose you were trekking
through the forest with a hundred rifles, and you found your way
barred by a thousand armed men. What would you do?"</p>

<p>"Go back," said Bones, "and jolly quick, dear old fellow."</p>

<p>"Go back? What would you go back for?" asked the other, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"To make my will," said Bones firmly, "and to write a few
letters to dear old friends in the far homeland. I have friends,
Ham," he said, with dignity, "jolly old people who listen for my
footsteps, and to whom my voice is music, dear old fellow."</p>

<p>"What other illusions do they suffer from?" asked Hamilton
offensively, closing his book with a bang. "Well, you will be sorry
to learn that I shall not recommend you for promotion."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that," said Bones hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I do mean that," said Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought if I had a pal to examine me, I would go
through with flying colours."</p>

<p>"Then I am not a pal. You don't suggest," said Hamilton, with
ominous dignity, "that I would defraud the public by lying as to
the qualities of a deficient character?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Bones, nodding vigorously, "for my sake and
for the sake of the child." The child was that small native whom
Bones had rescued and adopted.</p>

<p>"Not even for the sake of the child," said Hamilton, with an air
of finality. "Bones, you're ploughed."</p>

<p>Bones did not speak, and Hamilton gathered together the papers,
forms, and paraphernalia of examination.</p>

<p>He lifted his head suddenly, to discover that Bones was staring
at him. It was no ordinary stare, but something that was a little
uncanny. "What the dickens are you looking at?"</p>

<p>Bones did not speak. His round eyes were fixed on his superior
in an unwinking glare.</p>

<p>"When I said you had failed," said Hamilton kindly, "I meant, of
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I'd passed," muttered Bones excitedly. "Say it,
Ham&mdash;say it! 'Bones, congratulations, dear old
lad'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I meant," said Hamilton coldly, "that you have another chance
next month."</p>

<p>The face of Lieutenant Tibbetts twisted into a painful
contortion. "It didn't work|!" he said bitterly, and stalked from
the room.</p>

<p>"Rum beggar!" thought Hamilton, and smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed anything strange about Bones?" asked Patricia
Hamilton the next day.</p>

<p>Her brother looked at her over his newspaper. "The strangest
thing about Bones is Bones," he said, "and that I am compelled to
notice every day of my life."</p>

<p>She looked up at Sanders, who was idly pacing the stoep of the
Residency. "Have you, Mr. Sanders?"</p>

<p>Sanders paused. "Beyond the fact that he is father preoccupied
and stares at one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is it," said the girl. "I knew I was right&mdash;he stares
horribly. He has been doing it for a week&mdash;just staring. Do
you think he is ill?"</p>

<p>"He has been moping in his hut for the past week," said Hamilton
thoughtfully, "but I was hoping that it meant that he was swotting
for his exam. But staring&mdash;I seem to remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>The subject of his discussion made his appearance at the far end
of the square at that moment, and they watched him. First he walked
slowly towards the Houssa sentry, who shouldered his arms in
salute. Bones halted before the soldier and stared at him. Somehow,
the watchers on the stoep knew that he was staring&mdash;there was
something so fixed, so tense in his attitude. Then, without
warning, the sentry's hand passed across his body, and the rifle
came down to the "present."</p>

<p>"What on earth is he doing?" demanded the outraged Hamilton, for
sentries do not present arms to subaltern officers.</p>

<p>Bones passed on. He stopped before one of the huts in the
married lines, and stared at the wife of Sergeant Abiboo. He stared
long and earnestly, and the woman, giggling uncomfortably, stared
back. Then she began to dance.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake&mdash;" gasped Sanders, as Bones passed
on.</p>

<p>"Bones!" roared Hamilton.</p>

<p>Bones turned first his head, then his body towards the
Residency, and made his slow way towards the group.</p>

<p>"What is happening?" asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>The face of Bones was flushed; there was triumph in his
eye&mdash;triumph which his pose of nonchalance could not wholly
conceal. "What is happening, dear old officer?" he asked
innocently, and stared.</p>

<p>"What the dickens are you goggling at?" demanded Hamilton
irritably. "And please explain why you told the sentry to present
arms to you."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell him, dear old sir and superior captain," said
Bones. His eyes never left Hamilton's; he stared with a fierceness
and with an intensity that was little short of ferocious.</p>

<p>"Confound you, what are you staring at? Aren't you well?"
demanded Hamilton wrathfully.</p>

<p>Bones blinked. "Quite well, sir and comrade," he said gravely.
"Pardon the question&mdash;did you feel a curious and unaccountable
inclination to raise your right hand and salute me?"</p>

<p>"Did I&mdash;what?" demanded his dumbfounded superior.</p>

<p>"A sort of itchin' of the right arm&mdash;an almost overpowerin'
inclination to touch your hat&mdash;to poor old Bones?"</p>

<p>Hamilton drew a long breath. "I felt an almost overpowering
desire to lift my foot," he said significantly.</p>

<p>"Look at me again," said Bones calmly. "Fix your eyes on mine
an' think of nothin'. Now shut your eyes. Now you can't open
'em."</p>

<p>"Of course I can open them," said Hamilton. "Have you been
drinking, Bones?"</p>

<p>A burst of delighted laughter from the girl checked Bones's
indignant denial. "I know!" she cried, clapping her hands. "Bones
is trying to mesmerize you!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The scarlet face of Bones betrayed him.</p>

<p>"Power of the human eye, dear old sir," he said hurriedly. "Some
people have it&mdash;it's a gift. I discovered it the other day
after readin' an article in The Scientific Healer."</p>

<p>"Phew!" Hamilton whistled. So, he said, with dangerous calm,
"all this staring and gaping of yours means that, does it? I
remember now. When I was examining you for promotion the other day,
you stared. Trying to mesmerize me?"</p>

<p>"Let bygones be bygones, dear old friend," begged Bones.</p>

<p>"And when I asked you to produce the company pay-sheets, which
you forgot to bring up to date, you stared at me!"</p>

<p>"It's a gift," said Bones feebly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bones," said the girl slowly, "you stared at me, too, after
I refused to go picnicking with you on the beach."</p>

<p>"All's fair in love an' war," said Bones vaguely. "It's a
wonderful gift."</p>

<p>"Have you ever mesmerized anybody?" asked Hamilton curiously,
and Bones brightened up.</p>

<p>"Rather, dear old sir," he said. "Jolly old Ali, my
secretary&mdash;goes off in a regular trance on the slightest
provocation. Fact, dear old Ham."</p>

<p>Hamilton clapped his hands, and his orderly, dozing in the shade
of the verandah, rose up. "Go, bring Ali Abid," said Hamilton. And
when the man had gone: "Are you under the illusion that you made
the sentry present arms to you, and Abiboo's woman dance for you,
by the magic of your eye?"</p>

<p>"You saw," said the complacent Bones. "It's a wonderful gift,
dear old Ham. As soon as I read the article, I tried it on Ali. Got
him, first pop!"</p>

<p>The girl was bubbling with suppressed laughter, and there was a
twinkle in Sanders's eye. "I recall that you saw me in connection
with shooting leave in the N'gombi."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir and Excellency," said the miserable Bones.</p>

<p>"And I said that I thought it inadvisable, because of the
trouble in the bend of the Isisi River."</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency and sir," agreed Bones dolefully.&mdash;</p>

<p>"And then you stared."</p>

<p>"Did I, dear old&mdash;Did I, sir?"</p>

<p>His embarrassment was relieved by the arrival of Ali. So buoyant
a soul had Bones, that from the deeps of despair into which he was
beginning to sink he rose to heights of confidence, not to say
self-assurance, that were positively staggering.</p>

<p>"Miss Patricia, ladies and gentlemen," said Bones briskly, "we
have here Ali Abid, confidential servant and faithful retainer. I
will now endeavour to demonstrate the power of the human eye.</p>

<p>He met the stolid gaze of Ali and stared. He stared terribly and
alarmingly, and Ali, to do him justice, stared back.</p>

<p>"Close your eyes," commanded Bones. "You can't open them, can
you?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ali, "optics of subject are hermetically
sealed."</p>

<p>"I will now put him in a trance," said Bones, and waved his hand
mysteriously. Ali rocked backward and forward, and would have
fallen but for the supporting arm of the demonstrator. "He is now
insensible to pain," said Bones proudly.</p>

<p>"Lend me your hatpin, Pat," said Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I will now awaken him," said Bones hastily, and snapped his
fingers. Ali rose to his feet with great dignity. "Thank you, Ali;
you may go," said his master, and turned, ready to receive the
congratulations of the party.</p>

<p>"Do you seriously believe that you mesmerized that humbug?"</p>

<p>Bones drew himself erect. "Sir and captain," he said stiffly,
"do you suggest I am a jolly old impostor? You saw the sentry, sir,
you saw the woman, sir."</p>

<p>"And I saw Ali," said Hamilton, nodding, "and I'll bet he gave
the sentry something and the woman to play the goat for you."</p>

<p>Bones bowed slightly and distantly. "I cannot discuss my powers,
dear old sir; you realize that there are some subjects too delicate
to broach except with kindred spirits. I shall continue my studies
of psychic mysteries undeterred by the cold breath of scepticism."
He saluted everybody, and departed with chin up and shoulders
squared, a picture of offended dignity.</p>

<p>That night Sanders lay in bed, snuggled up on his right side,
which meant that he had arrived at the third stage of comfort which
precedes that fading away of material life which men call sleep.
Half consciously he listened to the drip, drip, drip of rain on the
stoep, and promised himself that he would call upon Abiboo in the
morning, to explain the matter of a choked gutter, for Abiboo had
sworn, by the Prophet and certain minor relatives of the Great One,
that he had cleared every bird's nest from the ducts about the
Residency.</p>

<p><i>Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip</i>!</p>

<p>Sanders sank with luxurious leisure into the nothingness of the
night.</p>

<p><i>Drip-tap, drip-tap, drip-tap!</i>
</p>

<p>He opened his eyes slowly, slid one leg out of bed, and groped
for his slippers. He slipped into the silken dressing-gown which
had been flung over the end of the bed, corded it about him, and
switched on the electric light. Then he passed out into the big
common room, with its chairs drawn together in overnight
comradeship, and the solemn tick of the big clock to emphasize the
desolation. He paused a second to switch on the lights, then went
to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p>"Enter!" he said in Arabic.</p>

<p>The man who came in was naked, save for a tarboosh on his head
and a loin-cloth about his middle. His slim body shone with
moisture, and where he stood on the white matting were two little
pools. Kano from his brown feet to the soaked fez, he stood erect
with that curious assumption of pride and equality which the
Mussulman bears with less offence to his superiors than any other
race.</p>

<p>"Peace on this house," he said, raising his hand.</p>

<p>"Speak, Ahmet," said Sanders, dropping into a big chair and
stretched back, with his clasped hands behind his head. He eyed the
man gravely and without resentment, for no spy would tap upon his
window at night save that the business was a bad one.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, "it is shameful that I should wake your
lordship from your beautiful dream, but I came with the
river."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I came when I could.]</p>

<p>He looked down at his master, and in the way of certain Kano
people, who are dialecticians to a man, he asked: "Lord, it is
written in the Sura of Ya-Sin, 'To the sun it is not given to
overtake the moon'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Nor doth the night outstrip the day; but each in his own
sphere doth journey on,'" finished Sanders patiently. "Thus also
begins the Sura of the Cave: 'Praise be to God, Who hath sent down
the book to his servant, and hath put no crookedness into it.'
Therefore, Ahmet, be plain to me, and leave your good speeches till
you meet the abominable Sufi."</p>

<p>The man sank to his haunches. "Lord," he said, "from the bend of
the river, where the Isisi divides the land of the N'gombi from the
lands of the Good Chief, I came, travelling by day and night with
the river, for many strange things have happened which are too
wonderful for me. This Chief Busesi, whom all men call good, has a
daughter by his second wife. In the year of the High Crops she was
given to a stranger from the forest, him they call Gufuri-Bululu,
and he took her away to live in his hut."</p>

<p>Sanders sat up. "Go on, man," he said.</p>

<p>"Lord, she has returned and performs wonderful magic," said the
man, "for by the wonder of her eyes she can make dead men live and
live men die, and all people are afraid. Also, lord, there was a
wise man in the forest, who was blind, and he had a daughter who
was the prop and staff of him, and because of his wisdom, and
because she hated all who rivalled her, the woman D'rona Gufuri
told certain men to seize the girl and hold her in a deep pool of
water until she was dead."</p>

<p>"This is a bad palaver," said Sanders; "but you shall tell me
what you mean by the wonder of her eyes."</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, "she looks upon men, and they do her will.
Now, it is her will that there shall be a great dance on the Rind
of the Moon, and after she shall send the spears of the people of
Busesi&mdash;who is old and silly, and for this reason is called
good&mdash;against the N'gombi folk."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sanders, biting his lip in thought, "by the wonder of
her eyes!"</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, "even I have seen this, for she has
stricken men to the ground by looking at them, and some she has
made mad, and others foolish."</p>

<p>Sanders turned his head at a noise from the doorway. The tall
figure of Hamilton stood peering sleepily at the light.</p>

<p>"I heard your voice," he said apologetically. "What is the
trouble?".</p>

<p>Briefly Sanders related the story the man had told.</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Hamilton, in a paroxysm of delight.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Bones!" shouted Hamilton. "Bones is the fellow. Let him go up
and subdue her with his eye. He's the very fellow. I'll go over and
call him, sir."</p>

<p>He hustled into his clothing, slipped on a mackintosh, and,
making his way across the dark square, admitted himself to the
sleeping-hut of Lieutenant Tibbetts. By the light of his electric
torch he discovered the slumberer. Bones lay on his back, his large
mouth wide open, one thin leg thrust out from the covers, and he
was making strange noises. Hamilton found the lamp and lit it, then
he proceeded to the heart-breaking task of waking his subordinate.
"Up, you lazy devil!" he shouted, shaking Bones by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Bones opened his eyes and blinked rapidly. "On the word 'One!'"
he said hoarsely, "carry the left foot ten inches to the left
front, at the same time bringing the rifle to a horizontal position
at the right side. One!"</p>

<p>"Wake up, wake up, Bones!"</p>

<p>Bones made a wailing noise. It was the noise of a mother panther
who has returned to her lair to discover that her offspring have
been eaten by wild pigs. "Whar-r-ow-ow!" he said, and turned over
on his right side.</p>

<p>Hamilton pocketed his torch, and, lifting Bones bodily from the
bed, let him fall with a thud.</p>

<p>Bones scrambled up, staring. "Gentlemen of the jury," he said,
"I stand before you a ruined man. Drink has been my downfall, as
the dear old judge remarked. I did kill Wilfred Morgan, and I plead
the unwritten law." He saluted stiffly, collapsed on to his pillow,
and fell instantly into a deep child-like sleep,</p>

<p>Hamilton groaned. He had had occasion to wake Bones from his
beauty sleep before, but he had never been as bad as this. He took
a soda siphon from the little sideboard and depressed the lever,
holding the outlet above his victim's head.</p>

<p>Bones leapt up with a roar. "Hello, Ham!" he said quite sanely.
"Well dear old officer, this is the finish! You stand by the
lifeboat an' shoot down anybody who attempts to leave the ship
before the torpedoes are saved. I'm goin' down into the hold to
have a look at the women an' children." He saluted, and was
stepping out into the wet night, when Hamilton caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Steady, the Buffs, my sleeping beauty! Dress yourself. Sanders
wants you."</p>

<p>Bones nodded. "I'll just drive over and see him," he said,
climbed back into bed, and was asleep in a second.</p>

<p>Hamilton put out the light and went back to the Residency. "I
hadn't the heart to cut his ear off." he said regretfully. "I'm
afraid we shan't be able to consult Bones till the morning."</p>

<p>Sanders nodded. "Anyway, I will wait for the morning. I have
told Abiboo to get stores and wood aboard, and to have steam in the
Zaire. Let us emulate Bones."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said Hamilton piously.</p>

<p>Bones came blithely to breakfast, a dapper and a perfectly
groomed figure. He received the news of the ominous happenings in
the N'gombi country with that air of profound solemnity which so
annoyed Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I wish you had called me in the night," he said gravely. "Dear
old officer, I think it was due to me."</p>

<p>"Called you! Called you! Why&mdash;why&mdash;" spluttered
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"In fact we did call you, Bones, but we could not wake you,"
smoothed Sanders.</p>

<p>A look of youthful amazement.spread over the youthful face of
Lieutenant Tibbetts. "You called me?" he asked incredulously.
"Called me?"</p>

<p>"You!" hissed Hamilton. "I not only called you, but I kicked
you. I poured water on you, and I chucked you up to the roof of the
hut and dropped you."</p>

<p>A faint but unbelieving smile from Bones. "Are you sure it was
me, dear old officer?" he asked, and Hamilton choked. "I only ask,"
said Bones, turning blandly to the girl, "because I'm a notoriously
light sleeper, dear old Miss Patricia. The slightest stir wakes me,
and instantly I'm in possession of all my faculties. Bosambo calls
me 'Eye-That-Never-Shuts'"</p>

<p>"Bosambo is a notorious leg-puller," interrupted Hamilton
irritably. "Really, Bones&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Often, dear old Sister," Bones went on impressively, "campin'
out in the forest, an' sunk in the profound sleep which youth an'
good conscience brings, something has wakened me, an' I've jumped
to my feet, a revolver in my hand, an' what do you think it
was?"</p>

<p>"A herd of wild elephants walking on your chest?" suggested
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"What do you think it was, dear old Patricia miss?" persisted
Bones, and interrupted her ingenious speculation in his usual
aggravating manner: "The sound of a footstep breakin' a twig a
hundred yards away!"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" sneered Hamilton, stirring his coffee. "Bones, if
you could only spell, what a novelist you'd be!"</p>

<p>"The point is," said Sanders, with good-humoured patience, which
brought, for some curious reason, a warm sense of intimacy to the
girl, "you've got to go up and try your eye on the woman D'rona
Gufuri."</p>

<p>Bones leaned back in his chair and spoke with deliberation and
importance, for he realized that he, and only he, could supply a
solution to the difficulties of his superiors.</p>

<p>"The power of the human eye, when applied by a jolly old
scientist to a heathen, is irresistible. You may expect me down
with the prisoner in four days."</p>

<p>"She may be more trouble than you expect," said Sanders
seriously. "The longer one lives in native lands, the less
confident one can be. There have been remarkable cases of men
possessing the power which this woman has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And which I have, sir an' Excellency, to an extraordinary
extent," interrupted Bones firmly. "Have no fear."</p>

<p>Thirty-six hours later Bones stood before the woman D'rona
Gufuri.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the woman, "men speak evilly of me to Sandi, and
now you have come to take me to the Village of Irons."</p>

<p>"That is true, D'rona," said Bones, and looked into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the woman, speaking slowly, "you shall go back to
Sandi and say, 'I have not seen the woman D'rona'&mdash;for, lord,
is this not truth?"</p>

<p>"I'wa! I'wa!" muttered Bones thickly.</p>

<p>"You cannot see me, Tibbetti, and I am not here," said the
woman, and she spoke before the assembled villagers, who stood,
knuckles to teeth, gazing awe-stricken upon the scene.</p>

<p>"I cannot see you," said Bones sleepily.</p>

<p>"And now you cannot hear me, lord?"</p>

<p>Bones did not reply.</p>

<p>The woman took him by the arm and led him through the patch of
wood which fringes the river and separated beach from village. None
followed them; even the two Houssas who formed the escort of
Lieutenant Tibbetts stayed rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>Bones passed into the shadow of the trees, the woman's hand on
his arm. Then suddenly from the undergrowth rose a lank figure, and
D'rona of the Magic Eye felt a bony hand at her throat. She
laughed.</p>

<p>"O man, whoever you be, look upon me in this light, and your
strength shall melt."</p>

<p>She twisted round to meet her assailant's face, and shrieked
aloud, for he was blind. And Bones stood by without moving, without
seeing or hearing, whilst the strong hands of the blind
witch-doctor, whose daughter she had slain, crushed the life from
her body.</p>

<p class="first">"OF course sir," explained Bones, "you may think
she mesmerized me. On the other hand, it is quite possible that she
acted under my influence. It's a moot point, sir an'

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE HOODED KING</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. 46, Nov
1917, pp 694-700</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was a certain Portuguese governor&mdash;this
was in the days when Colhemos was Colonial Minister&mdash;who had a
small legitimate income and an extravagant wife. This good lady had
a villa at Cintra, a box at the Real Theatre de Sao Carlos, and a
motor-car, and gave five o'clocks at the Hotel Nunes to the
aristocracy and gentry who inhabited that spot, of whom the
ecstatic Spaniard said, "dejar a Cintra, y ver al mundo entero, es,
con verdad caminar en capuchera." Since her husband's salary was
exactly $66.50 weekly and the upkeep of the villa alone was twice
that amount, it is not difficult to understand that Senhor
Bonaventura was a remarkable man.</p>

<p>Colhemos came over to the Foreign Office in the Praco de
Commercio one day and saw Dr. Sarabesta, and Sarabesta, who was
both a republican and a sinner, was also ambitious, or he had a
Plan and an Ideal&mdash;two very dangerous possessions for a
politician, since they lead inevitably to change, than which
nothing is more fatal to political systems.</p>

<p>"Colhemos," said the doctor dramatically, "you are ruining me!
You are bringing me to the dust and covering me with the hatred and
mistrust of the Powers!"</p>

<p>He folded his arms and rose starkly from the chair, his beard
all s-bristle, his deep little eyes glaring. "What is wrong,
Baptista?" asked Colhemos.</p>

<p>The other flung out his arms in an extravagant gesture. "Ruin!"
he cried, somewhat inadequately. He opened the leather portfolio
which lay on the table and extracted six sheets of foolscap paper.
"Read!" he said, and subsided into his padded armchair a picture of
gloom.</p>

<p>The sheets of foolscap were surmounted by crests showing an
emaciated lion and a small horse with a spiral horn in his forehead
endeavouring to climb a chafing-dish which had been placed on edge
for the purpose, and was suitably inscribed with another lion, two
groups of leopards and a harp.</p>

<p>Colhemos did not stop to admire the menagerie, but proceeded at
once to the literature. It was in French, and had to do with a
certain condition of affairs in Portuguese Central Africa which
"constituted a grave and increasing menace to the native subjects"
of "Grande Bretagne." There were hints, "which His Majesty's
Government would be sorry to believe, of raids and requisitions
upon the native manhood" of this country which differed little from
slave raids.</p>

<p>Further, "Mr. Commissioner Sanders of the Territories regretted
to learn" that these labour requisitions resulted in a condition of
affairs not far removed from slavery.</p>

<p>Colhemos read through the dispatch from start to finish, and put
it down thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Pinto has been overdoing it," be admitted. "I shall have to
write to him."</p>

<p>"What you write to Pinto may be interesting enough to print,"
said Dr. Sarabesta violently, "but what shall I write to London?
This Commissioner Sanders is a fairly reliable man, and his
Government will act upon what he says."</p>

<p>Colhemos, who was really a great man (it was a distinct loss
when he faced a firing platoon in the revolutionary days of '12),
tapped his nose with a penholder.</p>

<p>"You can say that we shall send a special commissioner to the
M'fusi country to report, and that he will remain permanently
established in the M'fusi to suppress lawless acts."</p>

<p>The doctor looked up wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Pinto won't like that," said he, "besides which, the M'fusi are
quite unmanageable. The last time we tried to bring them to reason
it cost &mdash;Santa Maria!... and the lives!... phew!"</p>

<p>Colhemos nodded.</p>

<p>"The due de Sagosta," he said slowly, " is an enthusiastic young
man. He is also a royalist and allied by family ties to Dr. Ceillo
of the Left. He is, moreover, an Anglo-maniac&mdash;though why he
should be when his mother was an American woman, I do not know. He
shall be our commissioner, my dear Baptista."</p>

<p>His dear Baptista sat bolt upright, every hair in his bristling
head erect.</p>

<p>"A royalist!" he gasped, "do you want to set Portugal
ablaze?"</p>

<p>"There are moments when I could answer 'Yes' to that question,"
said the truthful Colhemos, " but for the moment I am satisfied
that there will be no fireworks. It will do no harm to send the
boy. It will placate the Left and please the Clerics&mdash;it will
also consolidate our reputation for liberality and largeness of
mind. Also the young man will either be killed or fall a victim to
the sinister influences of that corruption which, alas, has also
entered into the vitals of our Colonial service."</p>

<p>So Manuel due de Sagosta was summoned, and prepared for the
subject of his visit by telephone, came racing up from Cintra in
his big American juggernaut, leapt up the stairs of the Colonial
Office two at a time, and came to Colhemoss' presence in a state of
mind which may be described as a big mental whoop.</p>

<p>"You will understand, Senhor," said Colhemos, "that I am doing
that which may make me unpopular. For that I care nothing! My
country is my first thought, and the glory and honour of our flag!
Some day you may hold my portfolio in the Cabinet, and it will be
well if you bring to your high and noble office the experience...
"</p>

<p>Then they all talked together, and the dark room flickered with
gesticulating palms.</p>

<p>Colhemos came to see the boy off by the M.N.P. boat which
carried him to the African Coast.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Senhor," said the duc, "there would be no objection
on the part of the Government to my calling on my way at a certain
British port. I have a friend in the English army&mdash;we were at
Clifton together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Colhemos, pressing the young man's hand
warmly, "you must look upon England as a potential ally, and lose
no opportunity which offers to impress upon our dear colleagues
this fact, that behind England, unmoved, unshaken, faithful, stands
the armed might of Portugal. May the saints have you in their
keeping!"</p>

<p>He embraced him, kissing him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>Bones was drilling recruits at headquarters when Hamilton hailed
him from the edge of the square.</p>

<p>"There's a pal of yours come to see you, Bones," he roared.</p>

<p>Bones marched sedately to his superior and touched his helmet.
"Sir!"</p>

<p>"A friend of yours&mdash;just landed from the Portuguese
packet."</p>

<p>Bones was mystified, and went up to the Residency to find a
young man in spotless white being entertained by Patricia Hamilton
and a very thoughtful Sanders.</p>

<p>The due de Sagosta leapt to his feet as Bones came up the
verandah.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Conk!" he yelled hilariously.</p>

<p>Bones stared.</p>

<p>"God bless my life," he stammered, " it's Mug!"</p>

<p>There was a terrific hand-shaking accompanied by squawking
inquiries which were never answered, uproarious laughter, back
patting, brazen and baseless charges that each was growing fat, and
Sanders watched it with great kindness.</p>

<p>"Here's old Ham," said Bones, "you ought to know
Ham&mdash;Captain Hamilton, sir, my friend, the duke of something
or other&mdash;but you can call him Mug&mdash;Miss
Hamilton&mdash;this is Mug."</p>

<p>"We've already been introduced," she laughed. "But why do you
let him call you Mug?"</p>

<p>The due grinned.</p>

<p>"I like Mug," he said simply.</p>

<p>He was to stay for lunch, for the ship was not leaving until the
afternoon, and Bones carried him off to his hut.</p>

<p>"A joyous pair," said Hamilton enviously. "Lord, if I was only a
boy again!"</p>

<p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

<p>"You don't echo that wish?" said Pat.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking about that&mdash;I was thinking of the boy. I
dislike this M'fusi business, and I can't think why the Government
sent him. They are a pretty bad lot&mdash;their territory is at the
back of the Akasava, and the Chief of the M'fusi is a rascal."</p>

<p>"But he says that he has been sent to reform them," said the
girl.</p>

<p>Sanders smiled.</p>

<p>"It is not a job I should care to undertake&mdash;and
yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He knitted his forehead.</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I could reform them&mdash;Bones could reform them. But if they
were reformed it would break Bonaventura, for he holds his job
subject to their infamy."</p>

<p>At lunch Sanders was unusually silent, a silence which was
unnoticed, save by the girl. Bones and his friend, however, needed
no stimulation. Lunch was an almost deafening meal, and when the
time came for the due to leave, the whole party went down to the
beach to see him embark.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old Mug!" roared Bones, as the boat pulled away.
"Whoop! hi! how!"</p>

<p>"You're a noisy devil," said Hamilton, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Vox populi, vox Dei," said Bones.</p>

<p>He had an unexpected visitor that evening, for whilst he was
dressing for dinner, Sanders came into his hut&mdash;an unusual
happening.</p>

<p>What Sanders had to say may not be related since it was quite
unofficial, but Bones came to dinner that night and behaved with
such decorum and preserved a mien so grave, that Hamilton thought
he was ill.</p>

<p>The due continued his journey down the African Coast and
presently came to a port which was little more than a beach, a
jetty, a big white house, and by far the most imposing end of the
Moanda road. In due time, he arrived by the worst track in the
world (he was six days on the journey) at Moanda itself, and came
into the presence of the Governor.</p>

<p>Did the due but know it, his Excellency had also been prepared
for the young man's mission. The mail had arrived by carrier the
day before the duc put in his appearance, and Pinto Bonaventura had
his little piece all ready to say.</p>

<p>"I will give you all the assistance I possibly can," he said, as
they sat at dejeuner, "but, naturally, I cannot guarantee your
immunity."</p>

<p>"Immunity?" said the puzzled due.</p>

<p>Senhor Bonaventura nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"Nothing is more repugnant to me than slavery," he said, "unless
it be the terrible habit of drinking. If I could sweep these evils
out of existence with a wave of my hand, believe me I would do so;
but I cannot perform miracles, and the Government will not give me
sufficient troops to suppress these practices which every one of us
hold in abhorrence."</p>

<p>"But," protested the due, a little alarmed, "since I am going to
reform the M'fusi... "</p>

<p>The Governor choked over his coffee and apologized. He did not
laugh, because long residence in Central Africa had got him out of
the habit, and had taught him a certain amount of self-control in
all things except the consumption of marsala.</p>

<p>"Pray go on," he said, wearing an impassive face.</p>

<p>"It will be to the interests of Portugal, no less than to your
Excellency's interest," said the young man, leaning across the
table and speaking with great earnestness, "if I can secure a
condition of peace, prosperity, sobriety, and if I can establish
the Portuguese law in this disturbed area."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," acknowledged the older man with profound
seriousness.</p>

<p>So far from the duc's statement representing anything near the
truth, it may be said that a restoration of order would serve his
Excellency very badly indeed. In point of fact he received
something like eight shillings for every "head" of "recruited
labour". He also received a commission from the same interested
syndicates which exported able-bodied labourers, a commission
amounting to six shillings upon every case of square-face, and a
larger sum upon every keg of rum that came into the country.</p>

<p>Sobriety and law would, in fact, spell much discomfort to the
elegant lady who lived in the villa at Cintra, and would
considerably diminish not only Senhor Bonaventura's handsome
balance at the Bank of Brazil, but would impoverish certain
ministers, permanent and temporary, who looked to their dear Pinto
for periodical contributions to what was humorously described as "
The Party Fund."</p>

<p>Yet the due de Sagosta went into the wilds with a high heart and
a complete faith, in his youthful and credulous soul, that he had
behind him the full moral and physical support of a high-minded and
patriotic Governor. The high-minded and patriotic Governor,
watching the caravan of his new assistant disappearing through the
woods which fringe Moanda, expressed in picturesque language his
fervent hope that the mud, the swamp, the forest and the wilderness
of the M'fusi country would swallow up this young man for evermore,
amen. The unpopularity of the new Commissioner was sealed when the
Governor learnt of his visit to Sanders, for "Sanders" was a name
at which his Excellency made disapproving noises.</p>

<p>The predecessor of the due de Sagosta was dead. His grave was in
the duc's front garden, and was covered with rank grass. The
newcomer found the office correspondence in order (as a glib native
clerk demonstrated); he also found 103 empty bottles behind the
house, and understood the meaning of that coarse grave in the
garden. He found that the last index number in the letter book was
951.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the man he succeeded should have found, in
one year, 951 subjects for correspondence, but it is the fact.
Possibly nine hundred of the letters had to do with the terrible
state of the Residency at Uango-Bozeri. The roof leaked, the
foundations had settled, and not a door closed as it should close.
On the day of his arrival the due found a mamba resting luxuriously
in his one armchair, a discovery which suggested the existence of a
whole colony of these deadly brutes&mdash;the mamba bite is fatal
in exactly ninety seconds&mdash;under or near the house.</p>

<p>The other fifty dispatches probably had to do with the late
Commissioner's arrears of pay, for Portugal at that time was in the
throes of her annual crisis, and ministries were passing through
the Government offices at Lisbon with such rapidity that before a
cheque could be carried from the Foreign Office to the bank, it was
out of date.</p>

<p>Uango-Bozeri is 220 miles by road from the coast, and is the
centre of the child-like people of the M'fusi. Here the due dwelt
and had his being, as Governor of 2,000 square miles, and overlord
of some million people who were cannibals with a passion for a
fiery liquid which was described by traders as "rum." It was as
near rum as the White City is to Heaven; that is to say, to the
uncultivated taste it might have been rum, and anyway was as near
to rum as the taster could expect to get.</p>

<p>This is all there is to be said about the due de Sagosta, save
that his headman swindled him, his soldiers were conscienceless
natives committing acts of brigandage in his innocent name, whilst
his chief at Moanda was a peculating and incompetent scoundrel.</p>

<p>At the time when the due was finding life a bitter and
humiliating experience, and had reached the stage when he sat on
his predecessor's grave for company, a small and unauthorized party
crossed the frontier from the British Territories in search of
adventure.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the particular region through which the
border-line passed was governed by the Chief of the Greater M'fusi,
who was a cannibal, a drunkard, and a master of two regiments.</p>

<p>The duc had been advised not to interfere with the chief of his
people, and he had (after one abortive and painful experience)
obeyed his superiors, accepting the hut tax which was sent to him
(and which was obviously and insolently inadequate) without
demur.</p>

<p>No white man journeyed to the city of the M'fusi without
invitation from the chief, and as Chief Karata never issued such
invitation, the Greater M'fusi was a terra incognita even to his
Excellency the Governor-General of the Central and Western
Provinces.</p>

<p>Karata was a drunkard approaching lunacy. It was his whim for
weeks on end to wear on his head the mask of a goat. At other
times, "as a mark of his confidence in devils," he would appear
hidden beneath a plaited straw extinguisher which fitted him from
head to foot. He was eccentric in other ways which need not be
particularized, but he was never so eccentric that he welcomed
strangers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those concerned, the high road from the
Territories passed through the M'fusi drift. And one day there came
a panting messenger from the keeper of the drift who flung himself
down at the king's feet.</p>

<p>"Lord," said he, "there is a white man at the drift, and with
him a certain chief and his men."</p>

<p>"You will take the men, bringing them to me tied with ropes,"
said the king, who looked at the messenger with glassy eyes and
found some difficulty in speaking, for he was at the truculent
stage of his second bottle.</p>

<p>The messenger returned and met the party on the road. What was
his attitude towards the intruders it is impossible to say. He may
have been insolent, secure in the feeling that he was representing
his master's attitude towards white men; he may have offered fight
in the illusion that the six warriors he took with him were
sufficient to enforce the king's law. It is certain that he never
returned.</p>

<p>Instead there came to the king's kraal a small but formidable
party under a white man, and they arrived at a propitious moment,
for the ground before the king's great hut was covered with square
bottles, and the space in front of the palace was crowded with
wretched men chained neck to neck and waiting to march to the coast
and slavery.</p>

<br>

<p>The white man pushed back his helmet.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious Heavens!" he exclaimed, "how perfectly
horrid! Bosambo, this is immensely illegal an' terrificly
disgustin'."</p>

<p>The Chief of the Ochori looked round.</p>

<p>"Dis feller be dam' bad," was his effort.</p>

<p>Bones walked leisurely to the shady canopy under which the king
sat, and King Karata stared stupidly at the unexpected vision.</p>

<p>"O King," said Bones in the Akasavian vernacular which runs from
Dacca to the Congo, " this is an evil thing you do&mdash;against
all law."</p>

<p>Open-mouthed Karata continued to stare.</p>

<p>To the crowded kraal, on prisoner and warrior, councillor and
dancing woman alike, came a silence deep and unbroken.</p>

<p>They heard the words spoken in a familiar tongue, and marvelled
that a white man should speak it. Bones was carrying a stick and
taking deliberate aim, and after two trial strokes he brought the
nobbly end round with a "swish!"</p>

<p>A bottle of square-face smashed into a thousand pieces, and
there arose on the hot air the sickly sent of crude spirits.
Fascinated, silent, motionless, King Karata, named not without
reason "The Terrible," watched the destruction as bottle followed
bottle.</p>

<p>Then as a dim realization of the infamy filtered through his
thick brain, he rose with a growl like a savage animal, and Bones
turned quickly. But Bosambo was quicker. One stride brought him to
the king's side.</p>

<p>"Down, dog!" he said. "O Kafata, you are very near the painted
hut were dead kings lie."</p>

<p>The king sat back and glared to and fro.</p>

<p>All that was animal in him told of his danger; he smelt death in
the mirthless grin of the white man; he smelt it as strongly under
the hand of the tall native wearing the monkey-tails of
chieftainship. If they would only stand away from him they would
die quickly enough. Let them get out of reach, and a shout, an
order, would send them bloodily to the ground with little kicks and
twitches as the life ran out of them. But they stood too close, and
that order of his meant his death.</p>

<p>"O white man," he began.</p>

<p>"Listen, black man," said Bosambo, and lapsed into his English;
"hark um, you dam' black nigger&mdash;what for you speak um
so?"</p>

<p>"You shall say 'master' to me, Karata," said Bones easily, " for
in my land 'white man'* is evil talk."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In most native countries "white man" is
seldom employed save as a piece of insolence. It is equivalent to
the practice of referring to the natives as niggers.]</p>
<br>

<p>"Master," said the king sullenly, "this is a strange
thing&mdash;for I see that you are English and we be servants of
another king. Also it is forbidden that any white&mdash;that any
master should stand in my kraal without my word, and I have driven
even Igselensi from my face."</p>

<p>"That is all foolish talk, Karata," said Bones. "This is good
talk: shall Karata live or shall he die? This you shall say. If you
send away this palaver and say to your people that we are folk whom
you desire shall live in the shadow of the king's hut, then you
live. Let him say less than this, Bosambo, and you strike
quickly."</p>

<p>The king looked from face to face. Bones had his hand in the
uniform jacket pocket. Bosambo balanced his killing-spear on the
palm of his hand, the chief saw with the eye of an expert that the
edge was razor sharp.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the group whom Bones had motioned away when he
started to speak to the king.</p>

<p>"This palaver is finished," he said, "and the white lord stays
in my hut for a night."</p>

<p>"Good egg," said Bones as the crowd streamed from the kraal.</p>

<p>Senhor Bonaventura heard of the arrival of a white man at the
chief's great kraal and was not perturbed, because there were
certain favourite traders who came to the king from time to time.
He was more concerned by the fact that a labour draft of eight
hundred men who had been promised by Karata had not yet reached
Moanda, but frantic panic came from the remarkable information of
Karata's eccentricities which had reached him from his
lieutenant.</p>

<p>The duc's letter may be reproduced.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT SENHOR,</p>

<p class="letter">It is with joy that I announce to you the most
remarkable reformation of King Karata. The news was brought to me
that the king had received a number of visitors of an unauthorized
character, and though I had, as I have reported to you, Illustrious
and Excellent Senhor, the most unpleasant experience at the hands
of the king, I deemed it advisable to go to the city of the Greater
M'fusi and conduct an inquiry.</p>

<p class="letter">I learnt that the king had indeed received the
visitors, and that they had departed on the morning of my arrival
carrying with them one of their number who was sick. With this
party was a white man. But the most remarkable circumstance,
Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, was that the king had called a
midnight palaver of his councillors and high people of state and
had told them that the strangers had brought news of such sorrowful
character that for four moons it would be forbidden to look upon
his face. At the end of that period he would disappear from the
earth and become a god amongst the stars.</p>

<p class="letter">At these words, Illustrious and Excellent Senhor,
the king with some reluctance took from one of the strangers a bag
in which two eyes had been cut, and pulled it over his head and
went back into his hut.</p>

<p class="letter">Since then he has done many remarkable things. He
has forbidden the importation of drink, and has freed all labour
men to their homes. He has nominated Zifingini, the elder chief of
the M'fusi, to be king after his departure, and has added another
fighting regiment to his army.</p>

<p class="letter">He is quite changed, and though they cannot see
his face and he has banished all his wives, relatives and
councillors to a distant village, he is more popular than ever.</p>

<p class="letter">Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, I feel that at
last I am seeing the end of the old regime and that we may look
forward to a period of sobriety and prosperity in the M'fusi.</p>

<p class="letter">Receive the assurance, Illustrious and Excellent
Senhor, of my distinguished consideration.</p>
<br>

<p>His Excellency went purple and white. "Holy mother!" he
spluttered apoplectically, "this is ruin!"</p>

<p>With trembling hands he wrote a telegram. Translated in its
sense it was to this effect&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">RECALL DE SAGOSTA WITHOUT FAIL OR THERE WILL BE
NOTHING DOING ON PAY DAY.</p>
<br>

<p>He saw this dispatched on its way, and returned to his bureau.
He picked up the duc's letter and read it again: then he saw there
was a postscript.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;In regard to the strangers who
visisted the king, the man they carried away on a closed litter was
very sick indeed, according to the accounts of woodmen who met the
party. He was raving at the top of his voice, but the white man was
singing very loudly.</p>

<p class="letter">PP.S.&mdash;I have just heard, Illustrious and
Excellent Senhor, that the Hooded King (as his people call him) has
sent off all his richest treasures and many others which he has
taken from the huts of his deported relatives to one Bosambo, who
is a chief of the Ochori in British Territory, and is distantly
related to Senhor Sanders, the Commissioner of that Territory.</p>
