  <h3>TO MY SISTER IN MEMORY OF OLD MOORLAND DAYS</h3>

  <h3>First published by:<br>
  John Lane/The Bodley Head, London/Macmillan &amp; Co., New York, 1896</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2>PREFATORY</h2>

  <p class="first">I FEEL that in some way I ought to apologise for the
  braggart tone of the title, as if in this little book one were to set himself
  to unfold a whole philosophy. The papers are scarce worthy of it&mdash;a few
  pictures of character and nature, pieces of sentiment torn from their
  setting, a fragment of criticism, some moralisings of little worth&mdash;the
  baggage of a vagrant in letters and life. A more miscellaneous equipment than
  ever was Don Quixote's, or that which girt the great Sir Hudibras.</p>

  <p>Yet there are one or two threads of connection, I fancy, to be discerned
  in the tangled web. First, they were all written in youth, when a man's
  thoughts run on many diverse things with a certain tentative aim. Further,
  they were written in close connection with that most beautiful country, the
  upper valley of Tweed, where the grace of old times seems to have long
  lingered. And an even stronger link of union may be found; for they are
  continuations and exemplifyings of the conception of the art of life
  contained in the first essay and the title of the volume; a conception as old
  as the hills, but ever new to its enthusiastic conceivers.</p>

  <p>The old noble commonplaces of love and faith and duty are always with us,
  since they are needful for the making of any true man or woman. But in the
  minor things of life, its pleasures, its recreations, we may have each a
  separate creed; we may each look upon it as an art, as Plato regarded virtue,
  to practise which lies in the power of every one.</p>

  <p>Eight of the essays are here published for the first time. One appeared
  formerly in a college print, and is here issued in a slightly different form;
  one is reprinted, with the permission of the Editor, from <i>The Glasgow
  Herald.</i> The remaining six have been contributed at various times during
  the last three years to <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>, to the editor of which I
  owe a debt of gratitude for great and continued kindness.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,<br>
  Shy to illumine; and I seek it too.<br>

  With place, with honour, and a flattering crew;<br>

  But the smooth-slipping weeks<br>
  Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;<br>
  Out of the heed of mortals he is gone;<br>
  He wends unfollow'd, he must house alone;<br>
  Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired.<br></i></p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;Matthew Arnold's <i>Thyrsis</i>.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE outlandish figure which a distinguished poet has added
  to our literature has been seen, or imaged, probably by many people. It is
  pleasing to think of such an inhabitant of the wilds; and if we do not now
  see his grey cloak among the trees, we can still think of him as near us in
  all our wanderings abroad&mdash;just behind that ridge of hill or beyond that
  tangle of underwood&mdash;a shadow which shuns our inquiry. For, in truth, he
  is an enchanting figure, with his antique habit, his haunting face, and wild
  keen eyes which see many things that are hidden from others. He is a scholar,
  too, and a good one, for he carries books in his cloak; and if we came up
  with him by some happy chance, we might find him reading Theocritus from an
  antiquated text of three centuries ago.</p>

  <p>It is many a day since the story "ran through Oxford halls," and the
  Scholar- Gipsy has long since ceased his wanderings. Yet his spirit by some
  occult transmigration is still abroad in the world and in many unlikely
  places. Like the young Will o' the Wisp in Andersen's story, no rank, no
  profession, is a safeguard against it. Sage men of law, scholars,
  divines&mdash;all have felt this wandering impulse, which would lead them,
  like Waring, to slip off "out of the heed of mortals" and see the world of
  which they know so little. And some who are wise in their generation, like
  this old scholar, seek to see both sides of existence, and add to their
  scholarship that knowledge of natural life which is becoming rarer as we
  travel further from the primeval simplicity.</p>

  <p>In former times this gipsying was part of a scholars life. He was
  compelled to journey over half of Europe, it might be, to the college of his
  choice, in a time when journeying was not always pleasant and seldom safe.
  The laws against begging were relaxed in his favour. He had no baggage except
  a book or two, and with his staff in his hand he trudged merrily forward on
  his adventurous way. These men were the most cultured of their age. The head
  that was covered by that tatterdemalion bonnet might be debating grave points
  in the Aristotelian logic, or with Plato framing immortal commonwealths. A
  sun-browned scholar was not apt to suffer from pedantry or unreal visions of
  things; while to sustain him on his way he had his love for learning and many
  rich eclectic stores to draw on for his entertainment. In days nearer our own
  some few members of the fraternity still survived. Goldsmith, fresh from his
  desultory college life, tramped through many countries with his flute in his
  pocket, and gained that large kindliness which makes one of the best features
  of his work. In our own day one of our most ingenious story-tellers has gone
  far and wide in many unchristian latitudes in search of wisdom and adventure.
  But after all, of the many who follow the life few ever attain to any
  reputation; for among other good things they acquire a genial contempt for
  fame, which is peculiar to men of genius and this disreputable
  brotherhood.</p>

  <p>It is not that this wandering spirit is rare to-day, for it is essential
  to the natures of great men of science, travellers, explorers, and many men
  of action. These, in pursuit of their callings, travel in rough, far-away
  places, and live with a careless scorn of the luxuries of civilisation. But
  the scholar is overmuch a man of books and colleges; pale-faced and
  dull-eyed, lacking the joys and humanities of life; yet still, it may be,
  with a drop of gipsy blood in his veins, which warms at the tale of wars and
  gallant actions and makes its possessor feel that his life is a very
  one-sided affair. Yet the way for him is easy; down one street and across
  another; and thence to the open country, to the green woodland, where the air
  is free and the great Earth-Mother as gracious as the Muses.</p>

  <p>The union of the two lives is fraught with so many rich and apparent
  advantages, that its apologist is almost unneeded; for neither is perfect,
  and the defects of each are remedied in great part by the other. The scholar
  has a mind filled with many creations of romance and poetry. He can people
  the woods with beings of his own, elves and kindly fairy folk, which are gone
  nowadays from our theology, but still live in the scholar's fancy. That rare
  classical feeling, which one finds in Milton and Tennyson, which sees the
  fair images of an older economy in common things of to-day, is only possible
  for the scholar. The old wandering minstrel had his share of it. Nicol Burne
  the Violer, who wrote the ballad of "Leader Haughs," and may have been, for
  all we know, the original of Sir Walter Scott's "Last Minstrel," has a way of
  introducing the divinities of Greece and Rome into the scenery of the Border
  country, which is distinct from any false classical convention.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="verse">Pan playing on his aiten reed,<br>
And shepherds him attending,<br>
Do here resort their flocks to feed,<br>
The hills and haughs commending;</p>

  <p class="verse">With cur and kent upon the bent,<br>
Sing to the sun good-morrow,<br>
And swear nae fields mair pleasures yield<br>
Than Leader Haughs and Yarrow.</p>

  <p class="verse">An house there stands on Leader-side,<br>
Surmounting my descriving,<br>
With rooms sae rare and windows fair,<br>
Like Daedalus' contriving;</p>

  <p class="verse">Men passing by do often cry,<br>
In sooth it hath no marrow;<br>
It stands as sweet on Leader-side<br>
As Newark does on Yarrow.</p>
<br>

  <p>Further, nothing can so clarify and perfect the intellectual senses as the
  constant association with beautiful natural sights.</p>

  <p>A strange sunrise or sunset is a greater element in the education of a man
  than most people think. Every appreciated object in Nature has an influence,
  imperceptible it may be, but none the less real, on the mental culture. Truth
  of perception, which was commoner among our grandfathers than with us, is one
  of the least of the benefits of Nature. A larger sense of form and colour and
  the beauty thereof, a finer feeling for the hidden melodies which may be
  heard hourly in any field, and a vastly increased power of enjoyment of life,
  are things which some would not count too dear at any price.</p>

  <p>The sadness, the continuous tragedy, which is inseparable from all natural
  life is bereft of its pain by the equipment of religion or an elevated
  philosophy, with which we may suppose the scholar to be furnished. The
  savagery of natural people like the gipsies is no imagined thing; this wanton
  cruelty and callousness to the pain of others forms the darkest blot on their
  lives. The robustness of healthy outdoor life is in no way weakened if
  tempered with a sensitive sympathy for weaker folk.</p>

  <p>As for the gipsy part, its advantages are far in excess of the somewhat
  slender stock that the scholar brings with him. The wandering among the
  fields and hills carries with it a delicate and abiding pleasure that to some
  means more than the half of life. The blessedness of mere movement, free and
  careless motion in all weathers and in all places is incomparably great. One
  morning sees a man in a country of green meadows and slow lowland streams,
  where he may lie beside a tuft of willows and dream marvellously; and the
  next finds him in a moorland place, high up above the valleys, where the air
  is like new wine, and the wide prospect of country gives the wanderer a sense
  of vast proprietorship. Whether the heather be in flower and the wilderness
  one great purple sea, or whether the bent be grey and wintry and full of
  pitiful black pools, it is much the same to him; for one of the marks of this
  spirit is its contentment with the world at all seasons. He may arrive tired
  and hungry at some wayside inn, and taste the delicious sleep of utter
  lassitude; or he may make his bed for the night in some nook in a wood among
  green brackens, and wake with a freshness which makes him wonder at the folly
  of man in leaving the open air for the unworthy cover of a house. For him
  there is no restraint of time or place. He can stay an hour or a week, as it
  suits him; he can travel fast or slow; he can turn if the fancy takes him,
  away from the highroad down green, retired lanes, and enjoy the satisfaction
  which comes from long hours of leisure in the height of summer.</p>

  <p>To the artist in life, the connoisseur of sensations and impressions, this
  manner of spending his days commends itself. There is a subtle influence
  about every place which dwells long in a man's memory, and which he may turn
  to time upon time and not exhaust its charms. Each type and shade of weather
  and each variation of scene leaves an indelible impression, so that soon he
  will have a well-stocked gallery in his mind to wander through, when the dull
  days come and he is bound hand and foot to his work in a commonplace town.
  Every sound carries with it for him a distinct sensation; the crowing of
  cocks about a farm, the far-off bleating of sheep on a hillside, the
  ceaseless humming of bees, and the plash of the burn among the grey rocks.
  Rhymes run in his memory, confused lines of great poets which acquire a
  meaning never grasped before; and he himself gets into a fine poetical state,
  and dreams pleasant things, which are vast nonsense when written down, but
  which seemed to him there and then to be of the essence of poetry. What
  philosophical system of life, though it be followed ever so rigidly, can make
  a man so high and free in spirit? It must needs be that one who lives among
  great sights should win something of their greatness for himself. The artist,
  too, whether in colours or words, gains a becoming humility. He feels the
  abject powerlessness of his brush or pen to express, in anything like their
  pristine beauty, many of the things he meets with. Not dazzling summer days
  or autumn sunsets, for these come within the limits of his art; but the
  uncommon aspects, like the dim look of the hills on certain days in
  April&mdash;such make him feel the impotence of language.</p>

  <p>The man who is abroad at all hours and seasons meets with many things
  which other folk never think of. Apart from mere fantastic sights, curious
  unions of earth and sky and weather, he begins to delight in the minutiae of
  observation. He loves to watch the renascence of life, the earliest buds, the
  first flowers, the young, perfumed birch leaves, the clear, windy skies. He
  can distinguish the call of the redshank or the plover among a concert of
  birds on a moor. He can tell each songbird by its note amid a crowd. Being
  out of doors at all times he becomes a skilful fisherman, though his tackle
  is often rude enough in all conscience; for by the riverside he learns
  something of the ways of a man with a fish. He takes pleasure in long
  wanderings after a mythical bird or fern, for to him the means are no less
  pleasing than the end. Every object in the world acquires for him a personal
  charm. He is interested in the heron as in some fellow-fisherman; the ways of
  the wren and linnet are not below his consideration; he has actually a kindly
  feeling for the inherent depravity of the crow. And behind all, like a rich
  background, come days of halcyon weather, clear, ineffable April evenings,
  firm October days, and all the pageantry of the "sweet o' the year" But above
  all such temporal blessings, there is that greatest endowment, which
  Wordsworth and Thoreau and Richard Jefferies sought and found&mdash;the sense
  of kinship with nature. Our attitude is too much that of aliens wandering on
  sufferance in a strange country, or rather like children looking through the
  bars of a gate into a rich demesne. Now there is a great deal of very
  whimsical nonsense talked on this subject, but there is more than a little
  truth. Most people witness fine natural sights as exiles, feeling with a
  living regret that such are foreign and beyond their narrow world. But to the
  man who is much abroad these come with pain or pleasure, according to their
  nature; but not as scornful, uncontrollable giants who mock his impotent
  wonder, but rather as forms of the great mistress whom he seeks to know.
  Rough shepherds on the hills have a way of talking of streams and weathers
  with a personal tone, as things which they meet in their daily life and have
  attained to some considerable knowledge of. Surely this is an enviable degree
  of kinship.</p>

  <p>As a man's mind is richly advantaged, so also is his body. He loses the
  sickly humours, the lassitude, the dulness, which oppress all sedentary folk.
  His sinews grow firm and his nerves strong. Tramping many miles over heather
  and inhaling the wholesome air of the uplands, or basking in sunlight among
  the meadows, makes his frame hardy and active and his skin as brown and clear
  as a moorland trout-stream. He begins to feel the <i>gaudium vivendi</i>, the
  joy of living, that the old Greeks felt, who in their wisdom built the
  palæstra beside the school. All immoment philosophies, nugatory and
  unsatisfying endowments born of the dreams of dyspeptic townsfolk, are
  banished from his brain; and he goes on his way with a healthy clarity of
  mind. He is not careful to seek an answer; nor is he perplexed by the ravings
  of a vitiated decadence; for he seeks only the true and strong in nature and
  art. But if he lacks in this he has other things at his will. His brain is a
  perpetual whirl of airy notions and wayside romances, which, like the sounds
  in Prospero's island, "give delight and hurt not." In his wanderings, he
  meets with all sorts of odd people, whimsical and grave; and he gets some
  little insight into the real humour and pathos which habit in the lowliest
  places.</p>

  <p>But after all it is more a matter of feeling than of practice. A man may
  live in the town eleven months of the year and yet be at heart one of this
  old romantic brotherhood. It is ingrained deep in the nature of some; others
  are so cumbered about with wrappings of convention that they take years to
  get free. They are seldom talkative people, at least in houses and among
  strangers, so they go on their pleasant way for the most part undisturbed,
  though their wide toleration, acquired from their manifold experience of
  life, wins them some few friends. The class is of necessity a limited one;
  for the majority of mankind are dull, equable folk, whose only romance in
  life is its close. But the eager, insatiable scholar and the wild, gipsy
  spirits, when in some rare case they come together, produce a union so
  enchanting that it is apt to seem to onlookers the very secret of life.</p>

  <p>For, if the one exists without the other, there come those tantalising
  regrets, those vistas of unused pleasure, which go far to make life a burden.
  Often when a man is sunk in town-life and thinks of nothing beyond, the mere
  sight of a bronzed face, a breath of the country, the glimpse of leaves or
  brown heather, and the old glamour of the greenwood is upon him and he grows
  weary with unsatisfied longings. Or, when one has been living for weeks in
  the heart of the natural world, with a heathenish disregard of man and all
  human inventions, a stray book in the corner of an inn, a chance sight of an
  old friend, recalls to him that he has been living in error and he sets about
  mending his ways with all speed.</p>

  <p>As for the end of life, when the strong man bows within us, surely it is
  they who have passed their days in ignorance of pain or true pleasure in a
  methodical existence, who have never felt the high hopes and the warm
  humanities of the scholar and the gipsy, who have never followed impossible
  ideals and eaten of the tree of knowledge whose fruit is for
  life&mdash;surely it is they who will find it hard to die. The man who has
  lived the best moments of his life abroad with nature sees no occult and
  terrible import in its end, regarding it as the passing, the dying unto life,
  which falls to the lot of all natural things. So, like Mr. Standfast, when
  "the time comes for him to haste away, and he goeth down, there will be a
  great calm at that time in the River."</p>

  <p class="first">IN a grey university town in the north it was once my good
  fortune to know one who passed among his fellow students with something of
  the air, I fancy, that the Scholar-Gipsy of Matthew Arnold must have had when
  by a rare chance he fell in with his friends of past years. He was courteous
  and kind to all, with a gracious condescension which was not that of a great
  man to an inferior, but rather of a stranger from some wiser planet who had
  strayed for awhile among us. With his keen, handsome face he passed through
  the gaunt quadrangle amid the crowd of pale, overworked weaklings, as one to
  whom learning came easily. He was a ripe scholar, beyond us all in classics,
  in philosophy, a lover of strange lore, learned in the literatures of many
  tongues; but beyond these tangible acquirements there was that baffling sense
  of deeper knowledge which lurked in his presence and puzzled the best of us
  with its evasive magic. In many of our memories his inscrutable figure long
  remained till it was effaced by more sordid impressions.</p>

  <p>Some years afterwards I met him. It was one golden afternoon in the end of
  July, as I returned to the inn from the river with my rod and a scantily
  furnished creel. Sitting outside I saw my friend of former years and hastened
  my steps to meet him. He was much changed. His face was thin and his back
  bent, but he had still the same kindly look and smile. We passed the evening
  together in the garden thick with Jacobite roses; and, as we talked, he told
  me bit by bit the history of his past. His parents had died when he was young
  and left him a sufficient patrimony; and his boyhood and youth had been
  passed much as he pleased in a moorland country. Here he had grown up,
  spending his days between study and long wanderings over a romantic
  country-side. In his college vacations it had been the same; seasons of grim
  work varied with gipsying journeys, fishing and travelling in high, wild
  places. He became learned in the knowledge of the woods, and many other
  things not taught in the schools, though he read his books with a finer zest
  and a widened humanity. After an honourable course at our college he had gone
  to one of the southern universities, and there after a career of unusual
  distinction he had settled down to the profession on which his heart was
  set.</p>

  <p>But while his life was yet beginning he was mortally stricken with the
  national disease, of which the seeds were in his race; and young, rich,
  brilliant as he was, he had to face the prospect of a lingering death. His
  mind was soon made up. To him the idea of ending his life in the town, like a
  rat in its hole, was too awful to be endured. He got together some few
  necessaries and books, and quietly, with no false bravado, set out on his
  last journey. He was able to go only short distances at a time; so through
  all the pleasant spring and early summer he travelled among the lowland
  country places, gaining contentment and a gallant cheerfulness from the
  companionship of nature. When I met him he had reached the borders of the
  great upland region in which his boyhood had been passed. He had only a few
  months at the most to live, but, though as weak as a child in body, he had
  lost not a whit of his old, gay humour.</p>

  <p>The next morning I bade him good-bye; and as I watched his figure
  disappearing from view round the bend of the road, I uncovered my head, for
  of a truth he of all men had found Natura Benigna, the Kindly Mother.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">IN all times from the dawn of civilisation and the
  apportioning of humanity in towns, men have clutched at this idea of the life
  of nature and culture. This is the truth which lies at the bottom of all the
  wondrous erections and systems of life which artists and philosophers have
  wrought for themselves. This is the true Bohemia; all others reek of foul air
  and bad tobacco, but this is filled with the very breath of Athena. The
  "plain living and high thinking," the "mens sana in corpore sano,"&mdash;all
  the varied shibboleths of the philosophies which have any consistent truth,
  are here realised in part or in whole. This, too, is the perfected doctrine
  of Epicurus, though the aim of its followers is less pleasure than
  completeness of life; to explore the heart of this fair, divine kingdom, and
  not to dwell in a churlish and half-hearted manner in the outlying lands.</p>

    <p class="caption">April in the Hills</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p>THE Lady of the Spring, when she comes to the uplands, has something of an
  acidulous and virginal chastity in her mien. She is unlike the debonair
  goddess who scatters her lavish favours in May. In truth, April is little
  more than winter with stray gleams of summer to temper his acerbity. Yet in
  the austere skies and barren woods there is not a little charm&mdash;the
  charm of latent strength and unborn magnificence.</p>

  <p>The waters have a cold look between the yellow banks and patches of brown
  heather. The snow on the hill-tops and the sparse remnants of drifts in the
  glens are perpetual tokens of the winter past. In the high corries you may
  find a glacier of snow with a yawning cavern at the top, through which you
  may see the black depths of darkness beneath. Those very white-rimmed hollows
  might bring an awful death to a man. If he slipped down one of the gaps there
  would be no more news of him in this world. Far below you can hear the
  trickle of the little runlets which issue forth to swell the burn of the
  glen. There you will find acres of burnt heather, whence the foot of the
  walker sends up a fine white dust; grey rocks still clammy with winter rains;
  and short, arid turf merging ultimately in the ranker lowland meadows.</p>

  <p>Yet, even here we have at times a symphony of colour. The blue-grey
  streams swirling past the dry grasses, the sun-flecks on the rapids, the
  deep, steely black of the pools, make a fine picture. Pied wagtails and
  water-ouzels, like spirits of the place, so completely harmonise in colour
  that it is only by their darting flight that one can discern them. You may
  come, too, on a nook where the yellow moss is as fine as old court-velvet, a
  blot of summer colour on the grave scene. Icicles and snow, sun and blue
  water, yellow and green and grey&mdash;there you have the lights and shadows
  of the glens in April.</p>

  <p>Snow falls in sharp, intermittent showers; but the common phase of weather
  is a dull, cold greyness of sky and air. The distances are clear and a trifle
  dismal; hills and trees are uniform and silent; the tops of the birches in
  the woods look like a pale vapour; the air is chilly, and the breeze shivers
  icily through the leafless trees. That line of Edgar's in his madness:</p>

  <p class="verse">Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind,</p>

  <p class="first">is for me eternally linked with the memories of an upland
April.</p>

  <p>But sometimes in a week of grey days there comes a golden one, when the
  clear spring sunlight makes the hills stand out cameo-wise; when the black
  pines are thrown into deeper shadow, all but the crests, which are golden or
  green or russet as the whimsical sunshine pleases. The patches of snow, which
  on a dull day give a wintry aspect to the landscape, have now a dazzling
  whiteness, as if the hills were really made of encrusted marble, which shone
  in places through the brown husk. The waters of the stream are never made
  golden by the sun as in summer, but are of a pale, silvery tint, which gives
  an eerie, witch-like look to the picture.</p>

  <p>Nor have we any of the common associations of spring, like the singing of
  birds. A mavis or a blackbird may on occasion break into a few notes, and
  there is, for certain, an increasing twitter among the trees. But the clear
  song of the lark as yet is not; the linnet does not pipe; the many named
  finches are still silent. The curlews scream and wail, a plover quavers
  across the bent, and the wild-fowl croon by the shallows. You may find, too,
  the songless heron stalking majestically by the stream and preparing for the
  time of nesting; and the grouse&mdash;sorely tried by late family
  bereavements&mdash;with renewed hope sets about her thankless maternal
  task.</p>

  <p>But if we dwell more or less in a shadowed valley and cohabit with solemn
  skies and windy heights, we may boast at least of one supreme beauty. There
  are few finer sights in the world, I take it, than a grey sunset. In the west
  the sombre pall is lightened from within, and the watcher waits expectantly,
  knowing that from that shell the phoenix of sunset is to arise. Nor is he
  disappointed. Slowly, by degrees, the veil lifts. Red and gold, dry and
  flagrant, burn within. A long shaft falls on the bare fields. The west
  unfolds like a rose. The grey mantle passes from the sky, and night, clear
  and star- lit, hovers over the earth.</p>

    <p class="caption">Milestones</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE ways of the world are many, leading nowhither, coming
  nowhence, ending ultimately in their beginning; and yet here and there by the
  side we find finger-posts, set up, as it were, to measure the infinite. The
  town is so many miles distant, the cheerful stone will tell you; and when you
  have reached your stage's end and made use of the scrap of knowledge, once
  more the stones take up their tale and dot the paths running forth into the
  unknown. What wayfarer has not found it in his heart by turns to bless and
  curse those wayside scrolls, and who, when all his journeys are over, does
  not look back on them with the regret begotten of old fellowship?</p>

  <p>The man who sees no distinction of nature in milestones is on the highroad
  to blindness. Each track has its own choice kind, which take all the
  attributes of the adventurous way, and solidify them into stone. By the low
  roads you have the great, stolid blocks, moss-grown and bedded in lush grass,
  which tell you their tale in mumbled words, like the speech of a palsied man.
  Up on the mountain ways the granite slabs set alert in the heather bear the
  impress of the hills: their surface scarred and seamed by wind and chill
  rain; lichen- clad, austere, deserted. Then to our sorrow there are the iron
  monstrosities which an intelligent public sets up for the guidance of that
  portion of it which foots the track. And last, what shall we say, there is
  that milestone which is none, but a bald lettering on the face of a boulder,
  crag, or common wall, gruff announcement of the path, stripped of all kindly
  manners.</p>

  <p>It is a pleasant fancy to beguile an hour to think of those who in
  old-world days set up and first gazed upon these stones. In the England of
  highwaymen and coaches they were there to mark the stages in a driver's
  memory, to guide the belated wanderer; stared on by honest faces, serving
  fair purposes and foul, silent witnesses of the dead and the forgotten. Now
  we are fallen on the times of the holiday shopman, well-furnished with map
  and guide-book, who needs not their humble aid. Once respected, they are now
  all but neglected, save by the vagrant who looks for them with hungry eyes,
  or the gentleman-tramp who makes them a matter for romancing; they exist for
  little save to form landmarks in the geographical vagaries of the rustic, who
  will mark out a place for you by its proximity to a milestone.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, too, the city stretches gaunt fingers toward the fields, and
  what not fifty years agone was a rustic path is now a street of the suburbs.
  All trace of greenery has been obliterated, save perhaps a scrap of hedge,
  grown dingy with smoke and summer's heat. But here, too, is one ancient
  friend, wedged in masonry or standing erect in its dignity, the
  sporting-place of the irresponsible urchin&mdash;a milestone, <i>prisci
  conscium aevi,</i> a battered relic of the old, happier days. Once the road
  ran placidly by it and quiet fields slept behind. Titmouse and chaffinch once
  hopped over it, where now there is only a mournful sparrow. 'Tis a mad world,
  we ponder as we pass by, scarce casting a glance at the antiquated legend on
  its face.</p>

  <p>Yet even in these days the generation of the stones is not fully served;
  there is still a place and a duty for them. I have known a man who was
  painfully affected by the very sight of one. He was used to spend strenuous
  days in the pursuit of a weary profession, and in his brief country walks he
  would fall in with these inscriptions. So many miles to such and such a place
  he would read; so many miles to Arcady it sounded; and to dwell on the long
  road stretching away from his feet past little hamlets and moorland farms,
  woods, and hills, and bickering streams, would give him a regretful pleasure.
  And when the time of his release came and the fates suffered him once more to
  "buckle on his pack," then he would linger lovingly over each stone as it
  told him of the steps of his journey towards El Dorado&mdash;surely the most
  futile of messages. Others beside my friend hail a milestone afar off; they
  rest by it, they eat their bread and cheese seated on the top, they bless it
  in the mornings and ban it heartily in the late afternoons.</p>

  <p>The character of these altars of Mercury, the god of travellers, has much
  to do with their share in our affection. If their foolish makers have set
  them up in the side of a village street or deep below a thick hedge, then I
  fear our love is not excessive. Surely this is a matter where foolish
  accuracy is little needed. Probably the spot is the mile's end; but were it
  not better to let slip a few yards and set it up yonder at the root of the
  beeches where the grass is fresh? But of all places give me the end of a
  bridge or the lee of a wood. At the first you can have your ears eased with
  the prattle of the water, and refresh your sun-blinded eyes with the cool,
  deep shadows. At the latter there is the mossy turf to lounge on, the
  never-ending whispering of leaves, the rustle of boughs, and the eternal song
  of birds to make musical the silence.</p>

  <p>But sentiment, I fear, comes too late in the day, and, as the proverb hath
  it, it is idle to lock the stable when the steed is off. We have it on the
  authority of a great wanderer that</p>

  <p class="verse">There's nothing under Heav'n so blue<br>
  That's fairly worth the travelling to.</p>

  <p>And if this be so, if the chief end of wayfaring is to be on the road and
  not to reach a destination, why then, the milestone will be as useless as a
  chance boulder on a hillside. In that golden age which is to come, when man
  will of his own accord destroy all clocks and watches, and see the folly of
  regulating time, we must suppose that they, as representing the parochial
  division of space, will not escape destruction. Meanwhile, till that day one
  may find much romance of the forgotten kind to dwell in the grey,
  weather-stained face of these mementoes of finitude.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; MAY-FLY FISHING</h2>

  <p>The hall clock has scarce struck the hour of one when we tramp over the
  lawn through the thin, fleeting darkness. The earth is buried in shadow, but
  the sky- above is lightening, and in the open spaces a sort of ghostly dusk
  prevails. The air is sharp, for there is a point of east in the wind, and at
  this hour in the towns on the east seaboard there will be a <i>haar</i>,
  chill and oppressive. But here there is midsummer weather, which will yield
  in two days' time to the grey desolation of a windy June. A bat flutters
  about, and as we strike the road a black shape glides into the hedge, which
  may be a weasel. Four miles of walking are before us ere we reach the bend of
  Tweed from which we would fish homewards. The slowly growing dawn comes
  flitting through the branches, revealing kine in the meadows and sheep on the
  hilly pasture, and now and then glimmer of water or a sleeping cottage.
  Through thick woods and between straight hedges and over a ridge of stiff
  moorland we go, till at length we come to the little wicket whence runs the
  by-path to the river.</p>

  <p>It is still dusky, though the sun has now risen, and the bank on the other
  side is hazy. The waters are grey as glass, with little films of fog rising
  from the surface. We choose the smallest and reddest of brandlings, fixed on
  the nicest of hooks dressed on the finest of gut. We can only cast by faith,
  for the eye cannot see where the line meets the water, or mark its downward
  progress. But this is the feeding time of the fish, and in two casts there is
  a dead pull on the line, and a fish sulks at the bottom. From this we infer
  that he is no trout, for such churlish conduct is unworthy of that delicate
  creature. Sure enough in ten minutes' time there comes tumbling on the
  shingle a stranger grayling, a pound and a half in weight, by the god of
  fishermen. For in these latter days some of the family have found their way
  into the Tweed, and work havoc among the little troutlings and break the fine
  gut of unsuspecting anglers.</p>

  <p>So master grayling finds his place in the basket, and as the light on the
  water is now clearer the May-fly box is produced, and an elegant winged
  creature succeeds the sorely battered worm. Now is the time for sport, and as
  the thin rod bends to each throw, and the plash and gurgle of great trout
  rising strike on our ears, we swear that the world is a good one and life
  well worth living. But, alas, for the rarity of consistency, for in a trice
  we hook a trout, a violent half-pound fellow, and by gross stupidity our line
  fouls the branch of a tree and breaks short. Then we call down the vengeance
  of heaven on fish and rivers, and mournfully decide that the time is out of
  joint.</p>

  <p>But soon we are successful, and with a little eddy our fly is sucked
  under, and another trout is hooked. This time we are less foolish, for with
  all the art we know we strive to keep him from the perils of reeds and
  dipping boughs, and guide his errant course to the kindly gravel. A little
  struggle, a moment of breathless anxiety, and there lies on the grass a
  well-bred yellow trout, scarlet-spotted, shapely, and shining like polished
  mail. Our hearts are cheered, and we fall to fishing warily, circumspectly,
  eyeing every likely nook, every hole and current, and casting as if our lives
  depended on the fly alighting like a stray petal of hawthorn. Soon we have
  secured another and yet another, and another again, till the open water is
  past, and the entanglements of wood and shrub begin.</p>

  <p>It is a charming morning, fresh, clear as crystal, and bright as only June
  can make it. Birds are twittering all round. The dipper is already flashing
  up stream, the moorhen is darting below her friendly bank, and the solemn
  heron is fishing up at yonder pool. On the other side is a crow-wood, and in
  the ceaseless caw-caw our guilty ears seem to discern a note of reproach. For
  was it not we who scarce a fortnight agone thinned their numbers with rook
  rifles? An old kestrel sails over the fir trees, stops, and hovers for a
  second as if about to dart to the ground. It may have been some little rabbit
  or feeble mouse which she saw. But whatever it was, the prey has gone under
  cover, for in another second she continues her way right across the valley to
  the rougher moorlands.</p>

  <p>The choicest of the meadow flowers, the typical colours of Tweedside, blue
  and yellow, are seen plentifully in the germander and the crow-foot, the
  tormentil and the milk-wort. But the meadow-sweet and the great yellow irises
  are still in bud. So also the heath which covers yon knoll among the firs.
  Yet the hawthorn is flinging its showers of snow on the grass, blossom covers
  the sloe like a garment, and the lilac and laburnum from the keeper's garden
  make the air fragrant. Underfoot the little bugle and lady's mantle, the
  dainty cuckoo flower, the stately water aven, and the great flare of marsh
  marigolds make the fields a mosaic of colours. All the delightsome sounds of
  an early summer morning fall on the ear. The cocks are beginning to crow from
  the farm towns; the water lapses to a pleasant tune; and in the pastures the
  cow bells tinkle as their wearers break their fast. Here in a country of
  woods the farmers string little bells around the necks of their property so
  that they may trace their whereabouts by the sound. All the world is gay and
  throbbing with new life, as if the angel of the dawn had poured fresh vigour
  on all nature at her advent. The day will be very hot, but at this hour it is
  cool as an October afternoon, and the distances are clear for many miles.</p>

  <p>Fishermen! Whatever lie-abeds may say of their craft they can afford to
  smile. For it takes them out to the greenest spots on God's earth at the time
  when man, spite of an absurd custom of civilisation, should be most active.
  It shows him much of the ways of bird and beast and flower, and if he be not
  the better for every minute he spends in its practice, then I take it there
  is something radically unwholesome in his whole nature. The man who fishes
  Tweed with the May-fly of a morning in June has the cream of the sport, and
  it is an experience which he will never forget. I have heard the tale of one
  who in his youth had dwelt by the Border stream, and had fished every pool
  and stream from Melrose to the Crook. Fate, with her accustomed hardness,
  decreed that his life should be passed in the East amid stress of business
  and swelter of weather. Fever took him, and in his last illness his native
  attendants were surprised to see their master making knots with his fingers,
  carefully holding something in his teeth, and swinging his arm as if he held
  a rod. He, poor fellow, was far away from the dust and heat, back once more
  in Tweeddale, tying flies, testing gut, and casting over the clear water as
  in the May mornings long since gone.</p>

  <p>But here we are at the further end of the tanglewood, where is the great
  pool from which many a goodly salmon is taken in the season. Here lives a
  great trout which has enjoyed a mild fame for some months, and which may
  weigh anything from two to seven pounds. He is feeding by the alders on the
  other bank, and even as we look we see a luckless fly sucked in by his
  lantern jaws. It is useless to try for him, so we pass by on the other side,
  quoting to ourselves the song of the contented man:</p>

  <p class="verse">For if he be not for me,<br>
  What care I for whom he be?</p>

  <p>But if the gigantic fish be not ours, the well-fed mediocrities are, for
  soon we have added another brace of ruddy trout to our basket. Afterward
  they, as the mermaid said of Lorntie, will "skirl in the pan"&mdash;not
  cooked to the fantastic receipt of Master Charles Cotton, but with good
  butter and oatmeal&mdash;a dish fit for the severest gourmand among the
  gods.</p>

  <p>What is the charm of May-fly fishing above all others? <i>Imprimis</i>,
  the trout, the big trout, love it especially and take it greedily.
  <i>Item,</i>it is a clean bait, easily handled, pleasant to use, and
  demanding much skill in the presentation. <i>Item</i>, it comes at the very
  sweet o' the year, when the heart of nature bursts into song, and morning,
  noon, and night are one substantial Elysium. One can fish with it in clear
  water, when all other lures, save that of the small worm, are worse than
  useless. And, truly, one fish out of the pellucid pool is, to the mind of the
  writer, better than five out of a turbid, muddy torrent. It is free from any
  taint of amateurishness, for though the novice may land a big fish with a
  lob-worm, from a swollen stream, only one who has been much at the trade can
  hope to succeed with this. There is but one flaw in the gem, or, to adapt a
  more suitable metaphor, but one fly in the ointment&mdash;it comes at a time,
  as Mr. Lang pathetically complains, when school, college, or stern business
  holds the human race in its unwelcome toils.</p>

  <p>But we are all but home again; and not all the pipes that man ever smoked
  can allay the yearning for breakfast. So be it now. We cross the stream by
  the old wooden bridge and are soon out of the paradise of blossom and
  wildwood into the trim walks of a garden. "Gather ye roses while ye may,"
  says the song. The Mayfly comes but once a year, and tarries only a little
  while among us. Gather it while ye may, and may the great fish of the pools
  be like-minded!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE MEN OF THE UPLANDS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Vale of the Upper Tweed is distinct from the
neighbouring dales of
  Clyde and Annan, and no less from the rich strath into which the Border river
  enters in its maturer course, in a way which may seem strange to one
  superficially aware of their proximity. You pass almost at a bound from the
  fat lands of Dumfries, or the wooded holms of Melrose, to a country of
  miniature and yet greater beauties. There you have wide vistas and broad
  streams; here we have vistas, waters, hills, woods, an epitome of landscape,
  small in the acreage of the surveyor, but large by that curious measurement
  which is the prerogative of the mind of man. It is indubitably a country of
  surprises, a dapper arrangement of landscapes which charm by their contrast.
  The cottar's garden, gay with all seasons' flowers, runs into the heather;
  reapers ply their trade within hearing of the thrush and the curlew; a meadow
  of hay is own neighbour to a grim pine- forest; and a sullen stream in one
  field may be an eddying torrent in the next. The art of the epigrammatist
  would be expended in vain in searching for the applicable word. One might
  call it austere, but for the grace of the woods; barren, but for the fresh
  green meadows and fruitful gardens; homely, were it not for some great blue
  shoulder of hill which bars the sky and gives solemnity to the little ridges.
  It is a country of contradiction, blended into harmony by that subtle Border
  charm which relates the crags of Moffatdale to the lowlands of Berwick.</p>

  <p>The people of this Arcady are in certain ways akin to their country-side.
  They, too, are full of surprises. Harshness and gentleness, worldly prudence
  and the most insane recklessness, humour and a crass stupidity, unite in
  varying degrees in their composition. In these narrow valleys tragedy and
  comedy dwell side by side in a confusion as grotesque as any Wonderland, and
  to the seeing eye there are plays enough acted every day of the year. To the
  casual traveller there is incongruity, to the man who has long known them
  there is none; for he feels each whimsicality ofcharacter to be the artistic
  companion of the variant landscape.</p>

  <p>Celtic and Saxon meet here, but Saxon has the predominance. Apart from
  such far-away histories there is one near and living fact of their genealogy.
  Their forefathers were those gallant gentlemen or disreputable ruffians (call
  them what you please) who played fine havoc with well-stocked Northumbrian
  pastures; who&mdash;and here is the sad part of the tale&mdash;so far forgot
  themselves as now and then to plunder their Scots brethren. Days and nights
  of riding, when a false step may be death, make a man's senses wonderfully
  acute. He learns to use his wits, which is well-nigh a lost art among us; he
  becomes versed in the lore of woodcraft and hill-craft; he can mark a glimmer
  of spears six miles away, and the saddle is more easy to him than his bed.
  Such a trade is not over- good for morality, save for the virtue of courage,
  which it undeniably tends to foster; but it is the very finest school in the
  world for the natural man. The folk of Tweedside to-day are sprung of this
  fighting stock. The fathers had little time to settle on their lees and sink
  into the country lout; and the children in consequence are of keener temper
  and finer spirit than the ordinary rustic. The difference is vividly seen
  when one looks at the Westland folk who have come from the remoter lands of
  Ayr and Lanark to settle by the Tweed. Honest and worthy, courageous and
  kindly, they lack few of the sterling virtues of life; they manage their
  farms with commendable industry; they fear God and do good in their several
  ways. But to set them on a level with the true-born Uplander is to rate
  butter-milk as high as Burgundy. It is conceivable that at certain times the
  former may be the more salutary diet, but this cheap quality of wholesomeness
  does not make the estimate any the more true. To this day you may find a
  certain enmity between the two strains, dislike on the one hand and distaste
  on the other.</p>

  <p>To the chance traveller in their midst that which appears the most
  prominent quality of the people is their singular acuteness of mind. To call
  them cultured or learned would be to brand them with an undeserved reproach.
  They have indeed something of a contempt for book-learning; the Scots
  phenomenon known as a "dungeon of wit" meets with less respect among them
  than elsewhere. The Book of Life is a volume which makes all printed matter
  of small significance. But in native shrewdness I should venture to set one
  of them against any other average inhabitant of the globe. Two well-known
  Scots philosophers, both sprung from humble origin, hailed from this place;
  but they are types and not exceptions. You may see any day, behind the plough
  or on the shearing-stool, men with faces as ponderously thoughtful as an
  Aquinas. This may seem an exaggerated picture, but I fancy it is not far from
  the truth. To be sure, this intellectuality of countenance is often
  deceptive, and its possessor may have no thought above whisky or
  mole-catching; but again it is not unfrequently only the index of the
  sagacity and gravity within.</p>

  <p>It is curious to note the floating fragments of learning which perambulate
  the countryside, stories derived, I know not whence, often strangely marred
  in the telling, but hinting at some share of the humanities (to use the fine
  Scots word) which was the possession of some prior generation. One old woman
  of my knowledge had a distant acquaintance with some of the tales in the
  "Odyssey." She surprised me on one occasion by declaring that her son's socks
  were no better than Penelope's web (she did not sound the last letter of the
  virtuous queens name), for what she mended in the morning was a hole again at
  night. She had never heard of Homer; the story was just an "owercome" which
  she had got from her mother. Still stranger was the tale which another was
  wont to tell as a warning to those who take pride in ugliness, dirt, and
  poverty. There were once two men, she would say, a farmer and a ploughman,
  the one rich and the other poor, the one humble and the other proud as Satan.
  One day the ploughman came to the farmer's home in his muddy boots, and was
  taken to the best room, where there was a very fine carpet. He had no sooner
  entered than he stamped his clogs upon the floor with every circumstance of
  scorn. "There," said he, "I trample on the pride of Platto"&mdash;Platto was
  the farmer's name. "Ay," says the other, "but with still greater pride." This
  is no less than the story of Diogenes and Plato, but the teller had no
  inkling of its source. "Did you ever hear of any one whose name was Platto?"
  I asked. "No," she said, "but, well there's folk called Latto, and Platto
  will just be an auld way of writing it."</p>

  <p>Dr. Penicuik of Romano, who wrote a book on Tweeddale in the beginning of
  last century, did full justice to the good qualities of the folk, but added
  that there was one curious defect in all&mdash;a total lack of music; "for,"
  he says, "music is so great a stranger to their temper that you will hardly
  light upon one amongst six that can distinguish one tune from another." I
  combat the assertion root and branch, and cannot help suspecting that the
  worthy doctor had no very shrewd ear for music himself. No people who had not
  a true love and gift for melody could have produced so many fine airs, and
  their written songs, though few in number, are yet choice of their kind. To
  cite one instance, there is that excellent drinking song, "Come sit ye doon,
  my cronies," which I would willingly set down were not my memory so
  feeble.</p>

  <p>But to pass to graver themes: there is one side of Scots life which no man
  can afford to neglect, though of late years it has rather been thrust down
  our throats. I mean the religious. It is a fine thing to say of any folk that
  their religion fills a large place in the world of their thoughts. But in the
  Border country I venture to think that it is weighted with a healthy
  worldliness, so much so that frequently it disappears from the surface
  altogether. For, say what we may, the Men of the Uplands are on the whole a
  worldly people. Explain it as you like, by their descent or by their
  countryside, the fact remains. They are not the stuff of which fanatics are
  made; the temporal and the tangible are too much before their eyes. For this
  very reason, in the days of the Covenanters and the persecution, the
  Peeblesshire men did not rise like the Westland Whigs. The fugitives in the
  Tweedside hills were mostly men from Annandale or gaunt-faced wanderers from
  the moors of Clyde. To be sure there were Habb Dab and David Din, who "dang
  the Deil ower Dobsons linn," who might have been expected to save the
  reputation of the place. These two worthies, hiding in a cave at the head of
  Moffat Water, were assailed by Satan in the guise of a pack of dried hides,
  and being strong in the faith, they promptly kicked him over the waterfall.
  As the song has it:</p>

  <p class="verse">Like a pack of barkit skins,<br>
  Doon fell Satan ower the Linns.</p>

  <p>But from the very fact of their supernatural intercourse it is to be
  inferred that these were the exceptions, and that the zeal of the arch-enemy
  to convert them may be attributed to a laudable desire on his part to keep
  the countryside consistent. It would be a hard task to rouse the people over
  any mere matter of scrupulousness, any nicety of ceremonial or refinement of
  Church government. We have in our midst a sprinkling of earnest Whigamores,
  but almost to a man they are of alien birth. The true Uplander conceives it
  to be a matter of little moment whether priest or presbyter chide his erring
  steps, or whether he worship his Maker on his knees or on his feet.</p>

  <p>Yet to call them a godless race would be to make a vast mistake. They are
  a devout people according to their light, which after all is not
  inconsiderable. In their daily life they are punctilious in the observance of
  certain minutiæ of the law, though when pressed they will admit that they
  scarce see the reason of their conduct. The reason, I take it, is their
  deep-rooted conservatism, holding to the old customs as far as possible,
  because their fathers did so and their grandfathers before them. They are in
  general excellent attendants on the Kirk, coming down from their distant
  glens with grave, decent faces, sitting like statues through a sermon which
  may be mere pulp to their strong brains, and returning home with a sense of
  duty fulfilled. They will rarely speak ill of a minister, believing, like
  George Herbert, that any want of appreciation on their part is due to the
  hardness of their hearts, which is a charming doctrine for the preacher. On
  the matter of the Sabbath, too, you will find them rigid with a most
  whimsical and pertinacious rigidity. One man of good character but no
  pretentions to piety made the writer's boyhood a burden by forbidding the
  reading of any secular book on the Saturday, Sabbath, or Monday. "For," said
  he, "though there's naething in the Bible about it, I hold that the Lord's
  day shall aye get plenty of room to steer in."</p>

  <p>Nor are the humours which attend the Church in Scotland wanting here.
  There was the minister of Tweedsmuir who, while walking on Sabbath, found a
  salmon stranded in shallow water, and who, being unable conscientiously to
  take it out on such a day, built a hedge of stones around it, and returning
  on the morrow claimed his prize. There was the old farmer who could not go to
  the Kirk because he had neglected to shave on the Saturday night, and he
  would not profane the day by the use of any edged tool. There was the
  minister of Broughton who prayed for dry weather in the midst of a perfect
  downpour, and when, notwithstanding his prayers, the great blasts of rain
  beat on the window, exclaimed in his aggravation, "Lord, Lord, but this is
  maist redeeklous!" There is the story of the eminent Dr. Robertson, the
  historian, who preached an eloquent sermon in the Kirk of Peebles, but forgot
  that the door was just behind the pulpit. He concluded in a whirl of rhetoric
  and gracefully sank back upon his seat; but the door was open and the
  congregation saw only the heels of the orator as he disappeared down the back
  stairs. There is no limit to such tales save the memory of the narrator and
  the patience of his hearers.</p>

  <p>I have said that there still exists in no inconsiderable measure the old
  fighting Border spirit, as dour as steel and as quick as a stream in flood.
  Few opportunities now remain for its appearance, for peace broods like a
  shadow over the land and fines for the breach of it are not desirable. But
  one outlet exists in an election contest. Politics to these folks are a
  matter of the most vital importance. Not even age, ill-health, and a great
  reputation could save Scott from insult on the hustings at Jedburgh. A man
  seriously adopts his party, not without grave consideration, for he knows
  that it will bring him lifelong hostility from the other side. There is no
  half-hearted hobnobbing with the enemy. Each sticks to his camp, and if by
  any chance he sees fit to change it he will be pursued with such a storm of
  contumely as may make him wish himself back with a hearty goodwill. Family
  ties are of no moment in the matter. I have heard of a farmer of undoubted
  respectability and a large kindliness whose own brother, just dead, had been
  of the opposite persuasion. He was talking gleefully of the decrease of the
  enemy in the place where his brother had lived. "There were a terrible lot o'
  Tories," he said, "and we were sairly bothered wi' them; but our Maker was
  very merciful to us and took a guid wheen o' them to Himsel'."</p>

  <p>There is something Spartanlike in this devotion on one side, but there is
  something little short of demoniac on another. The sight of the country town
  on an election day, when, contrary to all hopes, the Tory candidate has been
  elected, is one which a man will remember all his days. The proletariat are
  deeply conservative in nature, but for no earthly reason they are Whig to a
  man by profession. They fill the street, a crowd of brown determined faces,
  howling profanity. The result is announced; there is Bedlam for twenty
  minutes, then a mighty rush, and the honourable gentleman and his escort
  escape gracefully by a back close. Windows are shattered and a few heads
  broken; there is much marching and shouting; then the excitement calms by
  degrees, and by-and-by the men go home, very wearied, sometimes very drunk,
  and perhaps also a trifle ashamed.</p>

  <p>But a more agreeable proof of their spirit is the catholic fondness for
  sport which is common to both high and low. There is something admirable in
  this liking, for sport in itself is a good thing. It brings out all the
  virile and sterling qualities of a man; it leaves little room, it is true,
  for some virtues, but it keeps the ground against the more unmanly vices. The
  true sportsman is a prince of good fellows; and by the name I do not mean a
  good shot or a skilled rider, but a man who has a love for motion and the
  open air, and the two valuable qualities of courage and self-repression. It
  is indeed this element of sport which redeems many characters. A poacher may
  be a blackguard in very truth, but he would be a worse man if he were not a
  poacher. In him, too, is that love for danger and enterprise, that skill of
  hand and lore of nature, which go to ennoble his betters in the trade. To me
  it is something affecting to see the ragged weaver, out of work maybe, up to
  his knees in the stream intent upon his fishing, the herd-boy who whips the
  mountain burn with his homemade rod, the village grocer who gets a day's
  shooting now and then from the laird. They love it, and are learned in it
  above the common. It would be a blessing to the land if this love were
  infused into all sorts and conditions of men, and the wealthy landowner would
  give the humbler tenants a share in the sport on his estate if they sought
  it, and the great merchant would set his poor, town-bred clerks to fish his
  waters, instead of filling his country-houses with people who scarcely thank
  him.</p>

  <p>Again, this common taste sets all classes on a level. The curling-pond is
  a fine instance, where the laird, the minister, the farmer, and the labourer
  used to meet on a common ground. I well remember one man, the sheriff of a
  county, a scholar and a gentleman of birth, whose bosom friend on such
  excursions was one Rob Tait, an inveterate poacher. The sheriff would be
  <i>skip</i> and Rob was beyond all question a most noted player. "Come on,
  Rob, my man," he would say; "show us what ye can dae. Eh, man, but that's
  great; that's the kind o' shot ye read about in books. There's no your match
  in a' the countryside. I love ye like a brother, Rob." A week later the
  speaker would be on the Bench, and the great player arraigned before him for
  some one of his manifold offences. "Robert Tait, sixty days," would come the
  sentence in cold, judicial tones; and Rob would take it all in good part as
  from a friend, knowing that when he came out from prison and the winter
  returned there would be no estrangement.</p>

  <p>So much for the broad characteristics of the people, but what of the
  multitudinous interests and details of their daily life, their trades and
  professions, the little social ranks among them, the countless acts and
  scenes in the drama of their lives? It would need a new Sir Walter to do them
  justice, unless perchance the Laird of Abbotsford has done it already. It is
  a fact of some celebrity that a man from Tweedside loves his native valleys
  with a love so indiscriminating that it will admit no rival. The story of the
  Peebles man who after some experience of Paris declared that 'twas all very
  well in its way, but give him Peebles for pleasure, and that of the nameless
  enthusiast who refused to have the mud of Tweeddale cleaned from his shoes,
  prove the affection which the grey, old-fashioned land can inspire. So for
  one with a flying pen to venture to depict its arcana is a presumption more
  rash than that of the men who sought to carve the Koran on a nutshell.</p>

  <p>There is a great variety of character, but scarcely, I think, much choice
  of trades. Life is simpler there than elsewhere, and men have only a few
  narrow paths wherein to direct their energy. There are the farmers,
  slow-spoken and hard-headed, hospitable, kindly, with little of the
  cloddishness of their brother of the lowlands; the herds and labourers, big
  men, clad in the "shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun," reserved of speech,
  humorous, and silently contented; the more volatile folk of the towns, who
  have seen more of the world and are sharper in their talk; lastly, the dregs
  of the people, the poachers and black fishers, sullen fellows enough, but
  amusing if you take them aright, and full of stories as Chaucer's pilgrims.
  Then there is the leaven in the lump, the lairds and ministers and country
  doctors, and the wealthier townsfolk, provided always they be of the true
  indigenous stock and not alien settlers.</p>

  <p>But there is a dark side to the picture, one which can be shown of every
  community on the face of the earth. They have all the virtues of a high-
  spirited, high-handed race, and, let us add, not a few of its vices. The old
  description of the county town as "drouthy and Godfearing" holds true, unless
  the former attribute has overwhelmed the latter. A thirsty place it is and a
  thirsty people, as any one will declare who has witnessed a market-day or a
  convivial gathering. The old punch-drinking times have not quite gone from
  the land. To be sure, the men have strong heads and vast capacities, and what
  would make a speedy end of an urban bibulist is to them but milk and water.
  But it is playing with fire and does not always keep within bounds; and the
  end too often is much dismal and sordid tragedy.</p>

  <p>The riff-raff of the place, the "ne'er-do-weels" and outcasts, are the
  main upstays of riot and debauch. Stories could be told of queer doings among
  these ragged sunburned fellows, who spend their time in and out of jail. The
  salmon- poaching in the close season is the refuge of the vagrant and
  unsettled part of the community. It is hazardous in the extreme, for the
  waters are often swollen high, and men in the pursuit of sport have no care
  of their lives. The bailiffs, too, are keen-eyed and always on the watch, so
  that the game is pursued under the ban of the law and the hazards of the
  weather. "Firing the water," as it is called, consists in flaring torches,
  made of pine-knots or old barrel-staves dipped in tar, over the surface of
  the river, and so attracting the fish. The <i>leister</i> with its barbed
  prongs is a deadly weapon in a skilful hand, but in the use of it a novice is
  apt to overbalance himself and flounder helplessly in the wintry stream. The
  glare of light on the faces of the men, the leaping fish, the swirl of the
  dark water, the black woods around, the turmoil of the spot in contrast with
  the deathly quietness of the hills, the sack with its glittering spoil, the
  fierce, muffled talk, are in the highest degree romantic. Then, when the
  sport is over for the night, and if by a lucky chance they have escaped
  unmolested, they will often return to some cottage, and there with barred
  door and shuttered windows boil a fish, sup the <i>broo,</i> and finish with
  deep potations of whisky. But if some bailiff meets them, then Nemesis has
  them by the heels, and they make the best of their way to the county jail if
  they lack money to pay the fine. If, as sometimes happens, the might of the
  law be the weaker, a sharp scrimmage may ensue, some heads may be broken, and
  the band will scatter in hot haste to their homes. But we live in civilised
  times, when violence is sure to recoil upon the head of the transgressor; and
  sooner or later they will be brought to book for their misdeeds, and have
  leisure to repent in the quiet of a prison.</p>

  <p>There is, indeed, among the people a good deal of what sentimentalists
  name the Woodland Pan, what plain people call the old Adam, or plainer still,
  the Devil. But where does this not exist? At any rate, if it has been driven
  out in one form, it has returned in a worse. Some are old-fashioned enough to
  prefer plain, strong virtues and vices to those refinements which pass by the
  name among a certain portion of God's creatures. If such antiquated people
  are alive to-day, they may get some satisfaction out of the rough and tumble
  life of the hills.</p>

  <p>For the place is still unspoiled, still much as it was to Walter Scott and
  to the Ettrick Shepherd, when they wandered over its moors, drank at its ale-
  houses, and slept in its homes. Christopher North came often thither, and to
  him succeeded John Campbell Shairp, who has written the song which of all
  others most expresses its peculiar charm. It tells of the "Bush abune
  Traquair," a scrap of birch on the hillside above the Quair burn, and of
  those who once met there.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="verse">"Frae mony a but and ben,<br>
  By muirland, holm, and glen,<br>
  They cam' ane hour to spend on the greenwood swaird.<br>
  But long hae lad and lass<br>
  Been lying 'neath the grass,<br>
  The green, green grass o' Traquair kirkyaird.</p>

  <p class="verse">"They were blest beyond compare<br>
  When they held their trysting there,<br>
  Among thae greenest hills shone on by the sun;<br>
  And then they wan a rest,<br>
  The lownest and the best.<br>
  I' Traquair kirkyaird when a' was dune."</p>
  <br>

  <p>There died but the other day the last of that generous line of succession,
  Professor Veitch, who wrote much of the country-side, and knew it better
  perhaps than any other living man. But, alas! we can scarcely hope for the
  long continuance of the old freshness and vigour of the people, the old
  unsullied beauty of the valley; for the process of ruin is even now
  beginning. The old men are fast dying out, and the younger seek the cities,
  and so a new race is fast springing up which knows not the land. Waterworks
  and the attendant horrors of brick houses and cheap shops are contemplated to
  fill the glens; the shrill whistle of the engine is even now seeking to scare
  the curlews; landlords are leaving their estates to dwell elsewhere, and ere
  long we may look to see Tweed tinged with another hue than the autumn floods.
  But that day is not yet, and if it ever comes it will scarce be regretted;
  for by that time the valleys will be stripped of their kindly folk, the towns
  of their worthies; and if the people are gone, he who once loved the land
  will seek elsewhere for his pleasure.</p>

     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE</h2>

  <p class="quote">"You have learned many things, my friend, but one thing you
  have <i>not</i> learned&mdash;the art of resting. Once in the ardour of youth
  there shone before me a golden star in heaven, and on the deep azure around
  it, <i>Ohne Hast, ohne Rast,</i> in letters of steady flame. But now I see
  more frequently a plain little stone set in the earth, with the inscription,
  <i>Rest and be thankful</i>." &mdash;<i>The Intellectual Life</i>.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">ABOUT old-fashioned men, as about <b>old</b> books and old-
  world places, there is a peculiar charm. They and their fashions interest us
  by the very contrast they afford with ourselves and our surroundings. It is
  as refreshing to go back sometimes from this work-day world and dwell a while
  among them as to turn aside from the dusty highway into a cool green
  place.</p>

  <p>But yet, when we consider, there is an element of pathos in it all. Our
  memories are full of faces of past days, some of them gracious and good, some
  less pleasant, yet hallowed for us by the intervention of years. If we look
  at the characters there represented, we find them less common now, nay, in
  some cases, wholly unknown. We live in an age of hurry and feverish anxiety.
  Men live and work in a whirlwind, eagerly striving after many good things and
  pleasures; their fellows, even their friends, know little about them; their
  wives and families have only a slight acquaintance with them. They have no
  time for anything but business; and so they bustle and scheme until Death
  comes with his sponge and wipes them off the face of the earth, and there is
  an end of them. The atmosphere which we breathe nowadays is thicker and
  dustier than of old. We feel like Heine in Paris, hearing nothing but "the
  rattle of wheels, the clatter of hammers, street-cries, and the jingling of
  pianos, and longing for the trees and the fresh breezes of the forest of
  Broceliaunde."</p>

  <p>The men of the old-school&mdash;the gentlemen of leisure we may call
  them&mdash;did things in a different way. They were content to do their duty
  and earn their daily bread. They had time for many pleasures and were much
  respected in the countryside. They had room in their lives to cultivate their
  natures, grow wise if they wished, serve God, enjoy life, and make a good
  ending. All of which are desirable things, though of somewhat less account in
  these times.</p>

  <p>Of two characters in those pleasant, easy-going days I may be permitted to
  speak. One belonged to a most respectable class; the other was the essence of
  disrespectability. One was prosperous and has left a memory behind him; the
  other was poor and is forgotten. But in one respect the country parson and
  the wayside tramp were alike; both were emphatically and indisputably
  gentlemen of leisure.</p>

  <p>The lines of the old minister had fallen in pleasant places. The high-road
  from the capital to the south, coming down from the moorlands, dipped into a
  little valley before entering the pass which led it through the hills to the
  plains beyond. Just past the village by the burnside, in the great beech
  hedge which bordered the road, the traveller, if he were an observant man,
  might see a small green gate. In the spring this was overhung with lilacs and
  laburnum, and in autumn the great dog-rose bushes on either side used to send
  sprays of red berries athwart it. Here the postman left the letters, laying
  them below the roots of a hawthorn, where the old man found them in his
  morning walk. Down from the gate was a narrow gravelled path, leading through
  a thicket of firs and larches. Even in the warmest day in summer there was
  coolness here. The place was filled with birds who lived unmolested. A pair
  of jays nested year after year: magpies often came hither; and one memorable
  spring two goldfinches reared a brood in one of the firs.</p>

  <p>At the end of the trees, where the path became broader, you caught a
  glimpse of the house. Square and whitewashed, like so many country manses, it
  was almost covered with narrow pointed ivy. Round the foot ran a broad border
  of flowers, old-fashioned roses were trained against the side, and pear trees
  and plum trees on the south wall. In their season there was a goodly show of
  blossoms; great scarlet poppies, irises, and lilies were varied by those
  quieter flowers more famed for perfume than for colour. The silver-grey
  southern-wood, with that sweet smell which fills many a cottage garden,
  lavender, and mint grew luxuriantly: purple clematis, jasmine, and
  white-belled convolvulus twined over the porch; and at one corner of the
  house a great bed of thyme scented the air like that Sicilian thyme whereof
  Theocritus sings. Below the house stretched a lawn, small but with turf like
  velvet and shaded by noble trees. One of them, a copper-beech, was a source
  of endless pleasure to its owner. He would sit of a night on a garden-seat
  and watch the sun slanting over the hills and firing the topmost branches.
  Beyond the trees a part was kept as a bowling-green, where the players of the
  village assembled on the summer evenings. Here, too, the minister would often
  bring his books and write his sermons seated on the grass. Bordering the
  lawn, extending from the garden wall to the shrubbery of rhododendrons, was
  the long plot where the old man reared his favourite flowers. He had tulips
  of many colours, grown from bulbs brought from Holland by his grandfather,
  strange, old-fashioned plants from cuttings out of old castle gardens, and a
  thicket of wild flowers from the woods and fields. He had made use of the
  stream from a well on the green slope of the hill to form a little pool
  surrounded by ferns and mosses. It was pleasant to lie here in the warm
  weather, listening to the elfin tinkle of the water and the drowsy hum of
  bees in the limes. A delightfully mingled scent of lime blossom and cool
  green moss haunted the place, lulling the senses to sleep with suggestions of
  dripping sea-caves and summer woodlands. Some dozen fish lived in the pond,
  notably one big trout which I used to dream of in my boyhood. Thence, if you
  wandered down the gravelled path between high box borders with gooseberry
  bushes and apple-trees on either side, you came to the little summer-house,
  where you might sit and look across the low hedge, away over field and moor
  to where a glint of the Tweed shone below the hills.</p>

  <p>Here, in this garden, the old man loved to walk of a morning and evening
  and smoke a meditative pipe. To him it was his kingdom. He knew every flower
  and shrub, every bush and tree; and few things gave him greater pleasure than
  to show to his friends the beauties of his little domain.</p>

  <p>But, had we gone to the manse in the forenoon, we should have found him in
  his study. I have a vivid recollection of that pleasant, grey room. In summer
  the sunlight came in through the roses about the window, and played up and
  down among the great volumes on the lower shelves. In winter the firelight
  glowed on the brown calf and vellum backs, bringing out rich lights and
  colours on their sober surfaces. The owner of the room was in harmony with
  it. The tall figure somewhat bent with study, the keen scholarly face,
  beautiful with that light which one sees only on the faces of ministers who
  have grown old in their calling, the kindly voice&mdash;all combined with the
  fine courteous air of a gentleman of the old school, made his appearance
  singularly attractive.</p>

  <p>His library, though only that of a country parson, was by no means out of
  date. It was his custom to pay a half-yearly visit to the capital, from which
  he usually brought a parcel of books. The Fathers of the Church in huge
  leather- backed folios filled the lower shelves. The works of Leighton, that
  scholarly Archbishop of Glasgow whom the minister admired; Knox, Calvin,
  Buchanan, had their places; and strange old volumes of theology, too, for he
  had a taste for the out of the way. One and all, "he loved them well, they
  knew his hand." You might find many a rare edition of English classics,
  picked up at bookstalls or bought at sales in country-houses; a "Spenser"
  with the curious title-page engraving, and a "Pilgrim's Progress" with the
  quaint early frontispiece. Up in a little shelf beside the fireplace was a
  row of small duodecimos. Here were his especial treasures&mdash;an Elzevir
  "Imitatio Christi" in vellum, with its height untouched by the binder's
  shears; a "Tacitus" from the same press, and copies of some of the jealously
  repressed little volumes of the English Reformation.</p>

  <p>All the house was like the study, pleasant and comfortable. An old
  housekeeper reigned indoors; outside, an elderly man looked after the garden
  and stable on week-days, and on the Sabbath acted as beadle and
  precentor.</p>

  <p>Across the road from the manse, in a grove of elm-trees, stood the church.
  It was a little plain building, and the congregation even plainer&mdash;the
  people of the village with a few shepherds and farmers from the hills. Here
  for many a summer and winter the old man preached. He belonged to that
  much-despised party in the Scottish Church, the Moderates. They numbered many
  worthless fellows, it may be, but some good men redeemed them; some who, like
  our friend, were moderate in the best sense, strangers to intolerance,
  following the Socratic precept of <i>&mu;&eta;&delta;&nu;
  &alpha;&gamma;&alpha;&nu;</i> and showing their hearts by their lives. He had
  the love of all his parishioners; there was not a family in the country-side
  where he had not baptised or married or buried some one; and folk said that
  no other had such a kindly, consoling way in the House of Death. Surely this
  was <i>praesidium et dulce decus</i> sufficient for any man.</p>

  <p>In his younger days he had been a great sportsman. He was esteemed an
  experienced curler on the ice, where it is said he once thrashed a burly
  farmer for using profane language in his presence. In the fall of the year he
  used to shoot wildfowl on the moors; and, when we knew him, he was wont to
  show a case of stuffed birds in the hall which he had shot.</p>


  <p class="verse">"But most his measured words of praise<br>
  Caressed the angler's easy ways&mdash;<br>
  His idly meditative days,<br>
  His rustic diet."</p>
  <br>

  <p>Many a summer day he spent with rod in hand by the Tweed, where he said he
  found more inspiration than in St. Augustine. As he grew older he kept
  himself more and more to his garden, except when he left it to visit his
  people. And so he passed his quiet, uneventful days until the dark messenger
  came and bade him go hence.</p>

  <p>I well remember the last time I heard him preach. He had some fame as a
  preacher in the neighbourhood, and had once declined a call to a large city
  congregation. The pulpit stood in front of a great coloured window in memory
  of some former lord of the manor. It was a warm June day, and the light,
  coming through the blue-robed Christ, cast a strange halo round the old man,
  like the blue glow on the clouds before a snowstorm. Seldom had I heard a
  more beautiful sermon, filled, as it was, with the quaintest wisdom and
  charity and that strength born of "toil unsevered from tranquillity." One
  might have said of it as was said of old, <i>Verba ista sunt senum
  otiosissimorum.</i> A fortnight later the carrier brought me a letter from
  the minister's man, which announced in curious words of wondrous spelling
  that his master was dead. Peace to his ashes; <i>sic itur ad astra!</i></p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE other, you may find by the riverside, is angling with a
  hazel wand for trout, and no doubt his pockets, that do duty for a basket,
  are well filled, for he is skilled from long experience. He wears a broad
  blue bonnet, very dirty and faded, with some casts of gut wound round it. His
  grey homespun clothes are torn and patched in many places, and everywhere
  stained with earth and peat. His boots have once belonged to a shepherd, for
  they have the great thickness and iron-shod toes which are necessary for
  moorland walking. His face and neck, and the long brawny arms, which he has
  bared to free his hook from a tree-root, are as swarthy as a Moor's; and some
  thin grey locks, straggling down over his ears, make a pleasant contrast with
  his brown skin. He cannot be over forty, but rough living has whitened his
  hair before its time.</p>

  <p>The man's appearance is bold and cheerful. If the advice of Mephistopheles
  to Faust be true, and self-possession be the only art of life, then assuredly
  he has found the secret of existence. He takes life as it comes, the green
  and the grey of it, the summer and the winter. He has chosen the life that
  suits him best, free to wander where he will, with no restraint of work or
  duty. He fishes much, poaches a little, does an odd job or two at a farm or
  village, carries news, occasionally makes the brushes known as
  "heather-besoms," helps at the lambing-time, and, for the most part, enjoys
  himself. He is interesting and worth consideration, for he is one of the few
  relics of aristocracy which remain to us.</p>

  <p>But, though all tramps are leisurely, there are but few who can be called
  gentlemen. Most of them are disreputable fellows. Some poor creatures have a
  dingy wife and children to drag with them over the country. Surely such men
  will have a better fate in the next world, for they have a sorry one in this.
  Many are beggars, and, excepting the King's bedesmen, no beggar ever was a
  gentleman. Some God has gifted with health and strength, instead of which (to
  revive the old joke) they go about the country stealing hens. For such are
  reserved the jail and the ill-will of all honest men. But some (who are to be
  found for the most part in hilly places) are men of good character and good
  heart, who have taken to the life for the life's sake. They never enter the
  city, and, if you suggest such a thing, will indignantly ask if you expect
  them "to bide at a lodgin' house like a common gangrel body." They never beg,
  for they give something in return for their food. Many a shepherd would
  gladly keep such a tramp overnight for the sake of hearing the news from the
  great world beyond the grey hills which bound his ken.</p>

  <p>In former days the blue-bonneted wanderer was more welcome. Richard
  Jefferies, in one of his charming essays, gives a notice which he had seen
  and which ran as follows: "All persons found wandering abroad, lying,
  lodging, or being in any barn, outhouse, or in the open air, and not giving a
  good account of themselves, will be apprehended as rogues and vagabonds, and
  be either publicly whipt or sent to the house of correction, and afterwards
  disposed of according to law, by order of the magistrates. Any person who
  shall apprehend any rogue or vagabond will be entitled to a reward of ten
  shillings." A tramp had no such law to fear in our country-side. At some
  farm-houses his coming was eagerly looked for; and even at the lairds house
  he was given the seat at the fire for the sake of his news. There is a story
  told of a well-known Peebleshire laird of last century that, when one of the
  fraternity presented himself at his door, he demanded if he had any news.
  "Nane, sir," was the reply. "Then get ye gone," said the laird, "and dinna
  come back till ye've something to tell." After a few weeks the beggar
  appeared again. He told the servant that he had great news for his master,
  and was immediately brought into the room where that worthy sat with his
  wife. "Well," said the laird, "what's new the day?" "Oh," said the tramp, "I
  was just gaun to tell ye that I had been doon below i' the ill place sin' I
  saw ye last." "And what saw ye there?" asked the laird. "Mickle the same as
  here, the puir hadden doon wi' the great; but the Deil showed me a muckle
  chair aside the fire that he said he was keepin' for the laird o
  B&mdash;&mdash;" "You see, my dear," said the old man, turning to his wife,
  "I am preferred wherever I go." Another, in whom pride and curiosity were
  strangely mingled, was wont to drive every tramp from his door with blows and
  curses; and then, when the latter element triumphed, to run after him and
  beseech him to return. There was not then that hard-and-fast boundary between
  rich and poor, between the respectable and the disrespectable, that is one of
  the banes of our modern life. Men were more companionable and kindly (I use
  the word in its old and proper sense). Edie Ochiltree, that classic vagabond,
  would now be impossible; a capable man, without any trade or fixed place of
  abode&mdash;parochial boards and charitable societies would hold up their
  hands in horror and amaze! Yet the fact that we love Edie much more than a
  flourishing tradesman, as we prefer Ulysses to Alcinous, proves that a
  wandering life may develop these qualities in our nature which endear a man
  to his fellows at least as well as a life of staid and sober vacuity.</p>

  <p>A strange time the tramp had of it. Sometimes his course took him through
  green valleys and rich pastures, and sometimes over bleak moorlands with half
  a score of miles from one house to another. He was an old struggler, like the
  beggar woman who asked alms from Dr. Johnson. In warm summer weather he would
  sleep in a bush of heather, or behind a hedge, or in a covert of brackens in
  a wood. In the winter some straw in a barn sufficed for him, and he counted
  himself fortunate when he was allowed to lie before the ashes in the smithy
  fire. When he came to a village, he made first for the blacksmith's shop.
  Here, if he was a strong man, he assisted the smith, and, in return, was
  granted the use of the fire to cook his supper. Here, too, he would entertain
  the village idlers till late in the night with stories and country
  gossip.</p>

  <p>He lived, if ever a man did, from hand to mouth. He seemed to be
  uncomfortable with money in his possession. When he had made more than usual,
  in hay-time or harvest, he used to journey to the nearest market-town and
  seek out an inn, where he too frequently followed the advice which Luther
  gave to the young student perplexed with fore-ordination and free-will, and
  got very drunk. After a week or so of excess, he proceeded on his way with a
  look of relief on his face, as though his short prosperity had been a sore
  trial to him.</p>

  <p>An old vagrant, amiably disposed, was a treasure to those who loved
  old-world stories. He could tell how Tweed came down in the great flood, and
  the hairbreadth escapes of the shepherds, of hard winters and summers, of the
  coaching days and how the guard and driver of the Edinburgh mail were lost at
  Erickstanehead. He had legends and horrible tales of elves and goblins, in
  which he half believed. To crown all, he had his own experiences, for he had
  not travelled the country for a lifetime for nothing. Some of these were
  romantic enough, in all truth, sounding like some chronicle of the Middle
  Ages.</p>

  <p>The man had few wants. A pipe of tobacco and a warm fire raised him to the
  stars, as a much smaller thing, the mere insertion of his name in a list of
  lyric poets, did the Roman singer. Hard fare and rough quarters had made him
  contented with little. He was seldom ill, for his body was inured to heat and
  cold alike. So, since he had the primary blessings of health and contentment,
  he might very well do without the vastly inferior advantage of riches.</p>

  <p>Yet his way through the world was not unattended with evils. If trudging
  mile upon mile under a blazing sun or in a drifting snowstorm, with no sure
  hope of rest and food at the end, be a hardship, then the tramp had many. Few
  people know what it is to be utterly wearied. They have never felt that
  terrible sickness, that swimming of the brain, that painful weakness in the
  limbs, which a man feels when he has passed beyond the limits of his
  strength. If we add to these a parched throat and a burning head in the hot
  weather, and numbed hands and feet and a chilled heart in winter, we may get
  some faint idea of the pleasures of those forced marches which the tramp
  enjoyed. Moreover, people were not always hospitable; he often could get no
  work of any kind and had to live on the scantiest of meals. His days,
  certainly, were not all spent in a</p>

  <p class="verse">"...ditch supine,<br>
  Or footing it over the sunlit lea."</p>

  <p>There were seasons of hard toil and harder fare, of long winter nights
  spent on cold moors and short winter days in frosty fields.</p>

  <p>Then at last there came to the tramp, as there comes to all of us, the
  crowning misfortune of death. He had been all his life a man of many
  acquaintances and few friends, so that he made his end alone. It might be in
  the corner of a barn or up in a nook of the hillside. He was fortunate in
  having none of the miserable paraphernalia of death at hand. With the free,
  cool air blowing about him, in the midst of the scenes of his lifelong
  wanderings he made his quiet exit from the world, and the country people
  buried him in that corner of the churchyard reserved for such, where he lay
  among his fellows.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; SENTIMENTAL TRAVELLING</h2>

  <p class="verse">The only tune that he could play<br>
  Was "Over the hills and far away."</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">I MET my companion at the corner of the lane in the first
  freshness of a June morning. Sandy Scott was his name, and he sat
  complacently on a bank, smoking and contemplating the world. His clothes were
  a monument of tatters, "looped and windowed raggedness," once grey, but now
  bearing coloured remembrances of the soils of three counties. His hair was
  ignorant of the brush, and hung in picturesque disorder over a battered face.
  His listless, inimitable attitude, as he reclined (I will not say sprawled)
  below the hawthorns, seemed to me the perfection of ease; and the thin smoke
  from his pipe in the morning air was pleasing to all right-minded people. So
  far as mere externals were concerned, I was not far behind him. I had raked
  from some forgotten corner the cast-off garments of a shepherd. To these were
  added a rakish wideawake with a scanty brim, a plaid with a neuk, and a pair
  of mighty hobnailed boots to which my feet were wofully strange. Further, I
  had a fresh interest in all things and all men, and a relish even for
  misfortunes. My comrade was an old voyager on the seas of life; he had
  measured its deeps and shallows, whereas I was but embarking. A more oddly
  matched pair never set out to take the world together on a morning in
  summer.</p>

  <p>And now, as the writers of epics would moralise, over all the world men
  would be going forth to their labour; statesmen to their politics, lawyers to
  their courts, merchants to their ships. To-day treaties would be made, laws
  passed; ships would founder or enter port; men would die, and the unruly
  planet would go on its way. Meanwhile, in a corner of God's universe two
  irresponsible idlers were setting forth on their sentimental journey, without
  a thought of the complexity of life, for they were not writers of epics.</p>

  <p>The way wound pleasantly in a cool shade between limes and firs. A
  dry-stone dyke overgrown with moss and lady-ferns bounded the road. On one
  side the hill rose steep, grey with brackens and splendid in morning
  sunshine; while on the other level water-meadows, from which the scent of
  meadowsweet and mint was carried, stretched away toward Tweed. Curlews were
  crying on the hill, and a few belated grouse; in the fields the singing of
  the lark was varied by the loud, twanging calls of snipe. The most charming
  scent in the world was all abroad&mdash;thyme and meadow-grass, fir and
  lime-blossom, and the indefinable fragrance of morning. Sometimes a rabbit
  darted across, or a great ewe stared mildly at us as we passed. Stonechats
  flitted about; meadow- pipits (moss-cheepers in the picturesque Scots) made a
  continuous piping over the bent; and in the short tufts below the pines
  grasshoppers were chirping as merrily as on that morning long ago when
  Theocritus and his friends went on their way to Pyxus. Between the straight
  fir-stems one could catch glimpses of bright water from the pools which Tweed
  had left in the haugh. In winter these are not to be distinguished from the
  river itself when swollen high with rains; but in summer, when the stream has
  shrunk to a silver trickle, they lie fringed with flags and green rushes, the
  haunt of gorgeous beetles and innumerable wild- duck. The white ribbon of
  road twined across the breast of a hill which seemed to block the glen.</p>

  <p>Onward we trudged, one stolidly, the other with many occasional haltings
  and turnings-aside. I had not yet learned the secret of that swinging walk
  with firmly grasped stick and body slightly bent forward, which enables
  shepherds to tramp their thirty miles with ease over the roughest country. On
  the contrary, I limped and dragged, now walking with great strides, and now
  loitering at a snail's pace behind. We met few people; a farmer's wife
  driving to the distant railway station, who honoured us with a suspicious
  stare; a group of boys and girls going to school; a collier from a faraway
  parish who had been out at the night-fishing, and who, I am happy to say, had
  a light basket; for these gentry seldom fish with the orthodox fly, but with
  nets and drags and all kinds of heterodox contrivances.</p>

  <p>We passed Stanhope Bridge, which many a time in the memory of living men
  has been whirled down to the lowlands by a stormy river. Thence the road took
  a long swing up the side of a hill. No fence divided it from the moor which
  sloped steeply down to the water&mdash;an ugly place for a horse to go over
  on a dark night. The curiously marked hills of Stanhope stood out across the
  valley, shadowing the long, gloomy cleft through which the burn finds its way
  to Tweed. A faint haze was trailing on the hill-tops, but around us the air
  was filled with a lucent warmth.</p>

  <p>As we walked, Sandy treated me to some of his experiences among the hills.
  On one farm he had been a shepherd, and he was full of tales of snowstorms
  and terrible losses among sheep. He had poached on nearly every hill, and we
  rarely passed a pool in the river of which he had not some fishing adventure
  to tell. It was the most entertaining talk I had ever heard, and to a young
  scapegrace who should have been after more serious things it had a most
  appetising taste of forbidden fruit. Yet ever and anon he would pause to give
  utterance to some highly moral reflection&mdash;a salve, as it were, to his
  not over-sensitive conscience.</p>

  <p>The sun had now climbed well up in the sky, and, like Christiana when she
  came to the arbour on the Hill Difficulty, we were in a "pelting heat." We
  both longed for water, and, as there were no springs at hand, there was
  nothing for it but to ask at the nearest cottage. It was ordained that I
  should be spokesman, because, as my companion was pleased to say, "I was mair
  genteel- like aboot the face." Now I was sadly disinclined for the work, for
  though I was in no way ashamed of the profession I had chosen, I felt utterly
  incapable of acting my part. Yet I made an effort, which was rewarded with
  success, and water was given us in a great tin jug. The following
  conversation took place between the mistress of the house and the present
  writer:</p>

  <p>"Ye'll no belong to thae pairts?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Ye'll be a toon's body?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've lived in towns."</p>

  <p>"Ye'll be no muckle guid at the trampin'?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not."</p>

  <p>"Yell be a kind o' play-actin' cratur, I've nae doot?"</p>

  <p>I earnestly disclaimed any connection, but I am sure that in that honest
  woman's memory I live as a strolling member of the fraternity. We thanked her
  effusively for the water; but I, for one, repented when she assured us that
  she "keepit the tinnie for tramps, for nae decent body could drink oot o' the
  same dish."</p>

  <p>We crossed the burn of Kingledoors, which flows down from its black hills
  through a green and pleasant glen. There is a grim old story about the place.
  On a November day in the year 1524, Lord Fleming, the Chamberlain of
  Scotland, rode out from his castle at Biggar, to hawk among the moors. At the
  head of this burn he was met by one of the Tweedies of Drummelzier, an evil,
  raiding clan who held Upper Tweeddale in terror for many a year. A dispute
  fell out, as most disputes do, about a girl; and young Tweedie ran his
  opponent through the body, robbed the servants, and carried off the young
  Lord Fleming to his stronghold. The murderers paid some small fine, and there
  was no more of the matter. Such was the easy way of settling differences in
  those delectable times.</p>

  <p>The road kept straight and rigid between the river and the hills. One was
  reminded of the "Person of Quality" who visited these parts early in last
  century, and on his return described them as "a hill, a road, and a water."
  Yet there is nothing monotonous in this sameness; a grey, soothing landscape
  it is, with great cloud-shadows on the breast of the hills passing and
  repassing through the long days.</p>

  <p>Soon we draw near to the famous Crook Inn, renowned in coaching days and
  still holding a shadowy place of honour as the only hostel of any pretensions
  from Peebles to the head of Tweed. Here I was greatly afraid for Sandy, for
  to him, as to Odin, wine was both meat and drink. Yet to my astonishment he
  passed manfully by. A cynic might say it was because he lacked money; I chose
  to think that it was owing to the responsibility of my companionship. Thence
  our road ran uphill to Tweedsmuir, a little village set amid lonely uplands.
  Some flocks of sheep passed with their shy, sunburnt masters bound for a
  remote market. The drovers spend their days on the road, and their nights in
  barns or farmhouses, until their destination is reached. I well remember one
  boy who with a longing eye watched those brown-faced men passing through the
  streets, and longed to follow them to their far-away moorland homes.</p>

  <p>Tweedsmuir is one of the bleakest and most solitary of places. The gaunt
  vale of the Talla converges on the Tweed, and the village straggles around
  the foot of the twin glens. The church tower is a landmark for miles. There
  is an ineffectual waterfall below the bridge, where good trout are sometimes
  caught, called in a fine romantic spirit the Curlew Linn. Naked flanks of
  hills rise on all sides to block the horizon.</p>

  <p>A mile beyond the place we halted in a green dell beside a stream to eat
  our midday meal. The air had the warm quiescence of noon, and the calm
  moorland sounds were grateful to the ear. I out with a battered copy of
  Theocritus which had accompanied me in many wanderings, and read to Sandy
  that marvellous midsummer tale in the seventh idyll when "All things were
  odorous of the rich summer, of the fruit-time." The contrast was pleasing
  between the luxury of nature in the Coan orchard and the sober greyness of
  our neighbouring hills. The mellifluous Greek was so much Icelandic to my
  companion, but the riot of rich sound pleased him. He smoked and caressed his
  ragged beard in a state of inane tranquility.</p>

  <p>By-and-by we became restless, as is the nature of humankind to whom
  inaction is unnatural, and with one consent we got up and went onward. The
  day was just waning into a mellow afternoon. On our right lay the uniform
  hills which form the barrier between Tweed and Clyde. To the left a
  succession of tributary streams had made for themselves lonely
  glens&mdash;Menzion, Fruid, and the distant Cor&mdash;there is solitude in
  their very sounds.</p>

  <p>We were within some half-dozen miles, I think, of the head of the glen,
  when Sandy bethought himself of fishing. I laughed him to scorn, for, what
  with the bright day and the clear shallow water, I thought that no fish would
  rise to the fly. But I little knew the resources of my friend. He declined
  the offer of my fly-book, and produced from the mysterious depths of his
  pocket some lengths of gut and a few hooks of differing sizes, wrapped up in
  a dirty cloth. I watched him with an indolent interest.</p>

  <p>From a willow bush he cut a long, ten-foot wand, thin and pliable at the
  top but solid at the butt. To the end he tied a piece of line, a yard or so
  of gut, and a finely-dressed hook. He searched below stones and tufts of
  grass until he found a number of small white worms. Then he baited his hook,
  scrambled cautiously down to the river-side and began. Keeping well in the
  shade of the bank, he cast far up stream in a stretch of swift, shallow
  water. I have seen many fishers but never one so keen as Sandy. With his head
  down and his fragment of a hat all awry on his head and the water rippling
  over his boots, he watched his line as it floated down. He twitched it gently
  whenever it seemed to halt, but he must have made a dozen casts before he
  hooked a fish. Then began a battle royal. Up stream and down stream he went,
  for there was no reel on his home-made rod; and when at last he landed it, a
  trout of nearly a pound's weight on a patch of gravel on the other side, he
  was dripping with water and furiously warm&mdash;a strange spectacle for gods
  and men.</p>

  <p>For some time we kept the stream side, which, as a path, was more varied
  and natural than the highway. Four other fish were caught, comely brown
  trout, with the exception of one great, black fellow which Sandy had out of a
  deep pool. We strung them on twisted rushes for ease in carrying. The
  tussocks of rough grass were diversified with crisp, green stretches of turf,
  which had all the elastic buoyancy peculiar to the hills. Sandpipers were
  busy by the water, and their plaintive, twittering cries mingled with the
  music of the running stream. All around us we heard an assiduous murmuring of
  bees&mdash;not the humble brown bee of the lowlands but a dashing cavalier
  fellow, splendidly habited in orange-tawny. Now and then a saffron butterfly
  or a gaudy blue moth fluttered past. There was something of a dearth of
  flowers, for we saw little else than thyme and half- opened heathbells; but
  we knew that in a month the glen would be one flaming expanse of blossoming
  heather.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was now all but spent, and the air was beginning to grow
  cool and hill-like. The sounds which had been dulled by the midday heat
  became clearer&mdash;the bleat of sheep, the rumble of distant wheels, the
  chatter of the stream. Long ridges of moorland rose from the river-side and
  passed away into the infinite distance. Those interminable green hills are so
  retired and have such a subtle charm of their own that they who spend much of
  their time among them have little liking for ragged peaks and horrid ravines,
  feeling a proprietary interest in places so removed from men. The belt of
  upland from the Cheviots to Galloway is still to all intents undisturbed.
  "Little knows King Henry the skirts of Cairntable," was a proud saying of the
  Douglases. Ay, and little does any other man, unless it be the shepherds and
  a few sentimental wanderers. For there are no so-called places of interest;
  only round shoulders of hills, silent valleys, and old-world tales.</p>

  <p>The road wound at a gentle slope, crossing little brown burns tumbling
  down from the heights. We met one solitary baker's van trundling sleepily
  along, and bought from the unkempt driver some biscuits and scones. If the
  occupations of life were left to ourselves instead of being created for us by
  meddling circumstances, I should certainly choose to drive such a van. There
  are some elements of greatness about the course, to dispense the staff of
  life to dwellers in outlying villages and to spend one's days in a placid,
  bountiful land. It is so infinitely to be preferred to the vexations of
  business and politics that it seems strange that the profession of van-driver
  is not desperately overcrowded.</p>

  <p>The sound of the wheels died slowly away in the distance, and we tramped
  on through the purple, limitless dusk. We were hungry and tired, and not even
  the glories of a June sunset had charms to soothe us. We saw in front the
  small light which marked a shepherd's cottage, the outpost of civilisation in
  the glen. Now we were in no hopes of getting shelter for the night, for we
  were utterly disreputable and correspondingly resigned; so when we came near
  to the place we hardly cared to try the hospitality of its inmates. Yet we
  ventured, and with the happiest result. I asked first, but the Doric did not
  come natural to my tongue. The comely, squarefaced shepherd's wife made no
  response. But when Sandy with his beggar's flattery and irresistible
  mock-pathos made the same request, it was graciously conceded. "We micht bide
  a' nicht i' the shed, for we couldna dae ony hairm." We gratefully thanked
  her, and took up our quarters in a rickety lean-to half full of brackens. The
  place smelt of tar and sheep-dip, but we cared not a whit for that, and ate
  our supper with thankfulness of heart. Then we stretched ourselves on the
  brackens and slept in Homeric fashion, as soundly as ever did the Greek
  warriors "hard by their chariots, waiting for the dawn."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE morning came blue and cloudless, and we, who had been
  tired and dispirited on the previous night, rose in a hopeful frame of mind
  and regarded the world with serene equanimity. We were stirring with the
  first light, leaving two fish as payment for our quarters, and walked a mile
  farther, where we found a hollow by the roadside and lit a fire. We made tea
  and broiled our trout in the red ashes. It was good to be alive on such a
  morning. One felt the adventurous joy which comes from the outside world, and
  ceased to wonder at the lightheartedness of wild creatures, for the fresh air
  is intoxicating in its strength. It is some fugitive remembrance of this
  which makes hard-working artisans and clerks in their scant holidays traverse
  the country on cycles, or betake themselves to a crowded sea-coast.
  Lackadaisical folk groan over the aesthetic loss, but I care not a fig for
  aesthetics. Better that one of God's creatures be gratified than the whims of
  such foolish people. Our goodwill goes with every wanderer; for, after all,
  we are a gipsy race, and our true national singer is the redoubtable Piper's
  Son, who had one song only, but a choice good one.</p>

  <p>Two tramps passed us, early risers like ourselves. They exchanged some
  strange, confidential words with Sandy, which I could not follow. There is a
  bond of brotherhood on the road among all wayfarers, a gleam of decency in
  their lives. The tramp is an interesting study, and those who do not know him
  will hardly believe what a variousness there is in the clan. I have observed
  in the course of a short experience three divisions&mdash;the aesthetic, the
  religious, and the worldly. The aesthetic tramp, I fear, is a bit of a
  humbug. He will meet you and praise the weather and the landscape, moralise
  over the beauties of the universe, and then ask alms. Still he is generally a
  ready fellow, with a good share of native humour. I have known but one
  religious tramp, and he is a fragrant memory. He was a man of a ghastly
  complexion&mdash;"Pale Death" the village called him&mdash;and he held
  meetings in my grandfather's barn. Once I was present at one of them in the
  great dusty place, lighted by a single candle. The discourse still remains in
  my recollection; it began, I think, with the cardinal points of the faith,
  and ended with an admonition against "cruwality to animals." He was a worthy
  man, and it was remarked of him that he always cleaned the farm-byre or
  stable before he left as a mark of his gratitude. The great majority of
  tramps belong to the last class, and have few thoughts above their daily
  provender. Sandy was a compound of the aesthetic and the worldly. He had a
  love for fine natural sights and an equal liking for creature comforts. For
  him the loveliness of nature from long experience had become a common thing,
  while a good dinner and a warm fire had become idealised from the rarity of
  their advent. He had so rioted in the exquisite that the substantial was more
  to his liking.</p>

  <p>Before we reached the highest ground on the road, we passed a white
  desolate house, the farm of Tweedshaws; and looking down to the meadow below
  saw a little well with an upright stake beside it, which we knew for the
  source of Tweed. A few hundred yards more and we were on the summit, and a
  brisk wind from the Solway met us. The green, rolling lands of Annandale
  stretched away to the English Border. Hartfell and his brother giants, the
  high, masterful guardians of Moffatdale, lay clothed with sunshine, and far
  to the right rose the moorlands and pleasant slopes which cradle the young
  Clyde. A gracious, urbane landscape, with just the necessary suggestion of
  something more rugged in the remote hills.</p>

  <p>At our feet in the deep glen the little river Annan rose. The precipitous
  hollow, its source, is popularly called the Devil's Beef Tub; sometimes, too,
  the Marquis of Annandales Beef Tub, for it was the place of safety to which
  the Johnstones drove their ill-gotten herds. It gave a man a vast idea of
  space to look down and see the white dots on the turf which he knew to be
  sheep and the grey lines which might be a sheepfold. Here it was that the
  Laird of Summertrees, popularly called Pate-in-Peril, escaped, when on his
  way to trial at Carlisle; and he has left the most concise and picturesque
  description of the place to be had. "A d&mdash;d deep, black, blackguard-
  looking abyss of a hole it is, and goes straight down from the roadside, as
  perpendicular as it can do, to be a heathery brae. At the bottom there is a
  small bit of a brook, that you would think could hardly find its way out from
  the hills that are so closely jammed round it." A finer story hangs about the
  place. In the old coaching days a great snowstorm once delayed the Edinburgh
  coach at Moffat. The mails were important, so the guard and driver set out on
  horseback with them to reach Tweeddale and thence to the city. A few miles
  and the horses failed them, so they turned them back and struggled on foot
  through the drifts. Here at Erickstanehead, they perished, but before death
  they hung the mailbags on a post, and a shepherd going out in the-early
  morning saw the gleam of the brass buckles and learned the story of two brave
  men. After this a house of shelter was built, but the wind blew it down; then
  another, which was also unroofed; and to-day you may see the ruins on the
  steep above the Tub.</p>

  <p>When we passed the great hollow was full of mist, like steam from some
  mighty caldron. A desolate curlew sent a quavering cry out of the void, which
  died almost instantly in the silence. The place was as still and placid as a
  roofless temple.</p>

  <p>In half a mile we were round the bend of the hill and in lower latitudes.
  A kestrel flew in rings around a firwood by the roadside. The banks of
  mountain grass were fragrant with half-opened thyme, and soberly gay with
  milkwort and eyebright. A stone bridge, crusted with spleenwort fern, spanned
  a little burn which fell in the most reckless manner down the face of the
  hill. A few birch trees shaded it, and some wild roses threw pink blossoms
  across it. We turned into the place, and, lying in the shadow, enjoyed the
  summer; and, what with the heat and the tumbling water, I think I must have
  gone to sleep.</p>

  <p>About midday we both got up and looked around. A cloud had come over the
  sun. The world had not such a pleasing look as in the morning. The road was
  dustier, the trees less green, the hills more unapproachable. By-and-by the
  sun came out from his cloud, but somehow or other the charm had gone from the
  face of the world&mdash;for me, but not for my companion; he was unmovable
  and inured to all things.</p>

  <p>Our way grew more and more lowland as we went onward. A few cottages
  appeared, covered with creepers and with trim garden plots in front, which
  told us that certainly we had left the moorlands behind. Then a miller's
  cart, laden with flour-bags, completed the transformation. Never before had
  leisurely quiet seemed so attractive as it did to us, two tired wayfarers, on
  that summer afternoon. The blessing of movement is to accentuate the pleasure
  of rest; so also it is from the peacefulness of nature that motion acquires
  half its charm. If we could but behold the cyclic progress of the earth, I
  think that we should be quit of gipsy longings once and for ever.</p>

  <p>Some ungainly buildings rose among orderly trees, and we felt the aroma of
  civilisation. The sounds of men at work came to our ears; a woodcutter was
  busy in a small fir wood; the steady click of the mower was loud in the
  hayfields. We passed a churchyard and a golf-course, and, crossing the Annan,
  found ourselves in the notable town of Moffat.</p>

  <p>Now here it falls to my lot to chronicle my sad defection. Throughout the
  journey I had worn a pair of great hobnailed boots, which were clearly meant
  by Providence for peat-bogs, but not for the highway. So by this time of day
  my feet were more than a little sore. Also I had lost the fresh interest in
  travelling with which I had started; therefore, in a lamentable and un-
  Spartanlike spirit, I bethought myself of a friend's house, where I could get
  books and decent food, respectable clothes, and the other luxuries of
  life.</p>

  <p>I called a halt, and came to terms with Sandy. He made no objection,
  hinted no word of ingratitude; but I thought that I discerned somewhere in
  his grave demeanour surprise at my traitorous conduct. We bade each other
  good-day, and I turned aside, while my former comrade, with his stick
  flourished in the air, and reproach in his retreating footsteps, went
  stolidly on his way. Then I learned something of the feelings of Orpah when
  she chose to return alone to Moab.</p>

    <p class="caption">Urban Greenery</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">MIDSUMMER is with us, and the country is one blaze of
  sunshine and flowers. The streets are unwontedly long, thick with dust and
  hurrying humanity, white, deadly straight, and fiery as an oven. But in the
  outskirts of Babel, where ways are wider, among the older parts, there are
  still high- walled gardens, where one may taste the summer and forget the
  roar of life not a mile away. It is worth one's while to come here, for Our
  Lady, though not clad in virginal magnificence, is at least daintily arrayed,
  and the very scantiness of land and paucity of foliage, joined with the
  nearness of the mean and dirty, give it a charm of its own, like the beauty
  of a little lighthouse garden to sea-going sailors.</p>

  <p>The forenoon is awkward, for then the bustle of life is painfully
  apparent; the evening is distracting, for when the reds of sunset come over
  the housetops, the mind, whether it wills or not, travels to upland moors and
  wild sea-coasts; but the afternoon is urbanely idyllic. I say urbanely, for
  urbanity is the characterising word of the place, a gracious, town-bred
  restraint, prim and severely dignified, with just a touch of poverty to give
  it savour.</p>

  <p>The wall which encircles the domain is of bricks, old, dim, and dirty. But
  somehow a mellow russet has evolved from the soot and the dingy mosses which
  clothe it, so that when the sun is on it they shine as rich as an autumn
  wood. The ivy which half-clothes it is aged and scanty of leaf, with ragged
  grey stems and straggling offshoots. But here a blackbird will sometimes
  build, and after the shower this sordid foliage will glisten with innumerable
  jewels. Two valiant elms guard the corners, and midway a herd of little ashes
  and lindens form a thin grove, beneath which the earth lies long damp, and a
  few pale valley-lilies raise their heads in spring. What else is there? A
  privet hedge, which, unclipped, bears a wilderness of blossom, a lawn with
  wide borders of flowers, a minute shrubbery, two great beds by the house wall
  flanked by two birch trees, and little more. It is a place "shorn and
  parcell'd," with just enough magnitude to give point to its littleness.</p>

  <p>The flowers, too, are confined in variety, for not all can live well in
  such surroundings. Roses, curiously enough, grow and thrive; and old, hardy
  veterans, wallflowers, pinks, lilies, gillyflowers pick up a bare living.
  Just now there is a great show of rakish turk's caps and many-hued
  carnations, and on the wall the white Prince Charlie roses flaunt with the
  honeysuckle. But the place is not noteworthy for flowers, for, apart from its
  adventitious interest, its charms lie mainly in the well-kept grass and the
  cool, wide-spreading shade of the trees. Moreover, it is a spot for a distant
  prospect rather than a too intimate acquaintance. If you pluck the flowers
  you will find them speckled with soot, the leaves are darker than nature
  meant them to be, and the rich tints on the wall do not depend solely on age
  and weather. But if one be not over-critical, but rather content to make the
  best of things, he may gain from the place a feeling of deep solitude and
  ease.</p>

  <p>If the town is memorised in countless ways in the garden, the country,
  too, is not forgotten. Many kinds of birds come hither. I have seen jackdaws
  and magpies of a spring morning, blue tits in the boughs of the elm, a
  fly-catcher among the ivy, and linnets, thrushes, and starlings as thick as
  flies on the lawn. There is a rookery somewhere in the wide distance, whence
  come crows to strut and possess the land. One April morning, looking from the
  window, I saw a rabbit on the grass, a wanderer from Heaven knows what
  distant warren. The cuckoo comes every year, and its dominating note booms
  amid the pipes of lesser birds and the half-echoes of the faint street-cries.
  Indeed, there are many hints of the sun and the green woodlands, which come
  to perplex the man who has set himself to arduous work, and who, when he
  opens his window, hears the alluring voice of the piper and longs to
  follow.</p>

  <p>This urban garden is not without its association and fragments of past
  history. By the side over the young trees there rises an old square house,
  ivy- clad, with crow-step gables, and all the outward marks of antiquity.
  This was once the manor house of the place, when the suburb was still a
  smiling village among cornfields. The two big elms which lend dignity to the
  other trees were part of the green avenue which led to it There dwelt Wodrow,
  the historian of the Scottish Church, a man full of absurdity and kindliness,
  whose books are a charming farrago of gossip and grave reflection. One can
  fancy him walking here, composing his letters to Cotton Mather, and asking if
  the wild men and beasts of which his correspondent complained could be worse
  than the ravening Prelatists and lukewarm professors in his own unhappy
  country of Scotland. Over this place, too, was fought a great battle, which
  brought to the ill-fated Queen of Scots the loss at once of her kingdom and
  her liberty. Not half a mile off, fragments of steel are still found to
  testify to the struggle, and in this very garden was once dug up a little
  cannonball of the kind used at the time, with the crust of three hundred
  years upon it. There is indeed a sort of faded gentility about all things
  here, a flavour of old wars and devilry, old godliness and peace.</p>

  <p>And just as certain weather brings out certain tints in old buildings, so
  the afternoon calls these fleeting memories into existence. The colours are
  deeper, the smoke is not seen, the blossom and the greenery are at their
  finest. And over all is that subtle, ill-defined feeling of cessation in the
  midst of labour, of quiet among turbid memories, of romance in the very
  citadel of the unromantic.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX.&mdash; NATURE AND THE ART OF WORDS</h2>

  <p>TO paint a sunset, to tell of a spring morning, to depict the rose, have
  become proverbial synonyms for futility. It is readily assumed that all the
  greater beauties of the earth are beyond the reach of art, and that it is but
  modest to keep a reserved silence in their presence. So he who would speak of
  Nature and her domain must needs adopt the manner of the patient chronicler
  waiting upon his lady's moods, if he would avoid the name of an empty
  rhetorician.</p>

  <p>But in this reticence there is just a shade of false humility. Nature is
  not wider nor greater than art; nor is the beauty of the actual in itself
  beyond any representation. Indeed, in a sense, the truth is the opposite. All
  beauty is apprehended by the eye of the beholder; to speak in the tongue of
  the schools, it is subjective in essence. Art separates what is apprehensible
  from its irrelevant environment. In art we have the finished product, the
  gold refined from the dross, the immense focussed into the seen. The plaint,
  therefore, is not for the impossibility of art's undertaking, but for the
  difficulty of the means. To man is revealed the very core of natural
  loveliness. Art, which is the expression of the revealed, has for its
  business the communication of this to others, the giving of tangibility to
  airy nothings, the transmitting the personal into the objective. By what
  searching, then, can one find out the manner of this alchemy?</p>

  <p>The way which has most commended itself to a certain class of bookmen is
  the method of minute chronicling, by which their pages are turned into a sort
  of naturalist's note-book. One famous writer has done this to perfection;
  and, as is always the case, he has been followed by hordes of fatuous
  imitators. Yet I cannot think that Richard Jefferies is uniformly successful.
  More, I hold that when he does attain, it is in spite of his method. The
  record of the various objects which meet the eye and some interesting facts
  about the nature of each form a poor substitute for the glories of a sunlit
  landscape or a summer garden. Sometimes the very beauty of the words, and
  some faint, fragrant memories attached to those lovely names of violet and
  lime and lily, produce the desired effect, and in a second the mind is in the
  heart of the downs and woodlands. But this on the author's side is not
  conscious art; and it may happen that on the same page we come again to the
  weary chronicle, and find how barren is the method at root.</p>

  <p>But however vain it may be, this mode has at least the merit of plain
  sincerity. What shall we say of that which is lacking even in this&mdash;the
  rhetorical or pseudo-poetic? Here we are in the very midst of sound and fury.
  A cataract of words rolls on our ears. The pure, fresh beauty of nature is
  gifted with a rapid magnificence, and what is best known seems strangely
  foreign. There is much fine phrasing and daring comparison. All the resources
  of ancient literature and modern letters are drawn upon, and the result is a
  very pretty festival of light and colour. But we miss the note of truth; all
  is alien, unsympathetic, the froth without the wine.</p>

  <p>One other method is still to be reckoned with, which of the three
  approaches most nearly to perfection, though it fails of the summit. In this,
  nature is patiently and lovingly described; each thing is noted and
  represented by some image which is in itself accurate and admirable. Here
  scope is given to the shaping spirit of imagination. It would seem as if this
  were really the key to the mystery. Let us take as an instance a hillside in
  autumn. By this method we are told that the trees glow in the sun like golden
  wool, that the red brackens are like scraps of rusty rock thrusting their
  heads through the earth. This is excellent and in a sense very true; for
  limes in certain weathers, when struck by an afternoon sun, are like nothing
  so much as yellow wool, and the dull colour of the dead fern when seen from a
  distance is not unlike red sandstone. But here the truth stops. To the
  intellect the description after analysis seems nigh perfect; but to the
  casual reader it is woefully inadequate. The parts are good; the sum is
  worthless, crude, shapeless, without strength or unity. For in this matter a
  thousand little prettinesses do not avail, if the spirit be lacking from the
  whole.</p>

  <p>What is the way by which man with his feeble speech may represent the
  glorious out-of-doors, and cause art to fulfil her function? Indeed, it is
  hard to tell, but one may gather from a few examples some hint of the
  principle. Let us take one&mdash;hackneyed and common, if such great words
  can ever be common&mdash;from Shakespeare:</p>

  <p class="verse">
  The crows, the choughs, that wing the midway air<br>
  Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down<br>
  Hangs one who gathers samphire; dreadful trade!<br>
  Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:<br>
  The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,<br>
  Appear like mice; and yon tall anchoring bark,<br>
  Diminish'd to her cock; her cock a buoy<br>
  Almost too small for sight; the murmuring surge,<br>
  That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,<br>
  Cannot be heard so high.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Here all idle accessories are neglected. Only the grim outlines are taken,
  and the imagery is such that all stands out upon the mind as clear as
  statuary. The very words are so chosen as to give the impression of limitless
  space, immeasurable depth.</p>

  <p>Here is a passage from Robert Louis Stevenson telling of the Cevennes:</p>

  <p class="quote">
  "Peak upon peak, chain upon chain of hills, ran surging southwards,
  channelled and sculptured by the winter streams, feathered from head to foot
  with chestnuts, and here and there breaking into a coronal of cliffs. The
  sun, which was still far from setting, sent a drift of misty gold across the
  hill-tops; but the valleys were already plunged in a profound and quiet
  shadow."</p>
  <br>

  <p>And this of Scotland:</p>

  <p class="quote">
  "There is no special loveliness in that grey country, with its rainy, sea-
  beat archipelago; its fields of dark mountains; its unsightly places black
  with coal; its treeless, sour, unfriendly looking cornlands; its quaint,
  grey- castled city, where the bells clash of a Sunday, and the wind squalls,
  and the salt showers fly and beat."</p>
  <br>

  <p>Or, if you desire others, there is the account of the sea-fogs and the
  starlit night in "The Silverado Squatters," and the many exquisite bits of
  etching in his essays. To add words of praise to such is to gild refined
  gold. The very spirit of the place throbs and pulsates in each sentence; the
  thing is as clear and tangible as reality and chastened into form by a
  marvellous art.</p>

  <p>What then is the lesson of it all, which the industrious man seeks to
  learn and adapt to his own use? This and no other; that nature is so great
  and wonderful that it can only be apprehended by the loftier faculties of
  man; that a bald chronicle is a libel, since it exalts the superficial above
  the real. To pluck the heart out of a beautiful scene there must be the swift
  thought, the shining fancy, the golden word. All that is needless must be
  ruthlessly thrust aside; the key, the things which give character, the
  features in which dwells the spirit, must be sought earnestly and with many
  prayers. Language should give its aid, expressing by the very cadence and
  rhythm that which cannot be told in explicit words, but which is so momentous
  for the truth. Thus and only thus will mournful reiteration be avoided, and
  art, which is the ideal of nature, come to her own.</p>

    <p class="caption">Afternoon</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE Jacobite rushed from the house into the garden, swung
  himself wildly across a paling, and landed on all fours in the road. It was
  just past the noon; the cloudless summer day had left its zenith behind it;
  and the first minute degree of decadence had joined with the sun. July was
  not yet merged in August; the festival of nature was at its height, and the
  whole earth throbbed with joy. The hum of bees and the tirra of the lark, the
  cooing of wood-doves, the far-away calls of haymakers, and the plash of the
  mill-burn filled the air. It was one great world of flowers, green leaves,
  and the sunlit heaven above, cool waters, solemn hills, and a blue
  distance.</p>

  <p>The Jacobite was of noble appearance and gallant attire, as became his
  name. His age might have been twelve, but he was somewhat taller than the
  common. He was clothed in corduroys, formerly green, now many-coloured as
  Joseph's coat, and worn at the elbows to the likeness of chamois. Black,
  short-cut hair, thin shanks though stout as steel, a head held straight above
  the shoulders, a most cavalier carriage, and there you have him. A sprig of
  heath and a feather from a crow's wing were stuck in his hat, and in his hand
  was a well-used stick with a bar nailed thwartwise, which did duty as a
  sword. In his belt was a knife with a broken blade, and an old news-sheet,
  for he made pretence that he carried state papers of high import. He stood
  there in the road, well-pleased with himself and content with the world. The
  hurried exit had been but the exuberance of his spirits. He was on no fixed
  journey bound. With much searching he produced from a deep pocket a George
  III. penny, and spun it in the air. It fell face foremost in the dust, whence
  he picked it. Now was his course decided, and he turned resolutely to the
  highway.</p>

  <p>In a little he came to a shop, a window in a flower-surrounded cottage,
  which proclaimed the residence of a wayside trafficker. The Jacobite
  considered his financial position. He possessed, he reflected, moneys to the
  extent of one penny and one halfpenny; this found on the road, that given by
  a benevolent grandfather. So he marched through the honeysuckled entrance,
  and stood delighted, inhaling the quaint, pleasing odours of bread and
  ancient brandy- balls, bacon and paraffin. He thought how proud the owner of
  such a place must be, and wondered mildly how such a man condescended to
  treat with so small a customer, from which it will be seen that he had no
  contempt for trade. He bought a pen'orth of treacle-toffy, and stowed it
  about him. Fain would he have expended the other coin, but that it would have
  left him without supplies&mdash;a position he held hateful to the spirit of a
  cavalier.</p>

  <p>Once more he stood in the sunshine, with the world before him and a
  thousand voices calling him hither and thither. He raced tumultuously over a
  field of close turf, scattering sheep before him like chaff. Then over a
  fence and into a byway, where he loitered for a second to fling a stone at a
  casual rat; and then with a whoop and a skirl of delight he was at the
  river.</p>

  <p>Down its banks he strolled in all the glory of undoubted possession. There
  was no boy in the place who dared lift hand against him. For had he not
  fought his way to renown, till in a battle the week before, attended by half
  the village, he had defeated William Laidlaw, the shepherd's son, who was
  earning his own living, and so no more in the field of fair encounter, and
  severely battered the said William's face? From this combat he had been
  dragged by an irate grandparent, and even now he was dreeing his weird in the
  loss of his dog, his most faithful ally, who in a lonely kennel sadly
  bemoaned its master. For grown- up persons he cared naught, for he knew by
  long experience that they were a weak-kneed folk and feeble in the race. So
  amid the nodding grasses he swung along, whisking the heads off the
  meadow-sweet with his sword, in most unmilitary fashion, telling himself that
  he was setting out on a journey as great as erst Sir Galahad or Sir John
  Mandeville, that sweetest and most truthful of knights. He had his store of
  provisions in his pocket; he was armed with sword and dagger and a stout
  heart; with another bellow of defiance he drew his blade and stalked on like
  Goliath of Gath, or Ajax defying the celestial lightning.</p>

  <p>A sound in the bushes, a rustle, a movement, and the Jacobite was on his
  face, breathing hard and peering warily forth. It was only a thrush, so once
  more he got upon his feet and advanced. Just where the woods began he had a
  sharp conflict with a rabbit, which escaped amid a volley of stones. Once
  inside the cover, among the long, ghostlike firs and tremulous beeches, he
  felt he was on classic ground. There was every probability that an enchanter
  lurked among the shadows or a wild-boar in the rocks. To be sure, he had
  never seen such things, but they must be somewhere about. He clasped his
  sword a little timorously, but still with strong purpose. The river looked
  black and unfriendly, a fitting haunt for kelpies and mermaidens.</p>

  <p>Soon he came to where another stream entered, a bright, prattling,
  sunshiny burn, such as his soul loved. Thither he felt his course lay. Now
  was the time to emulate the heroic John Ridd, when he tracked the Bagworthy
  stream and met the girl Lorna.</p>

  <p>Without doubt some Lorna awaited his coming among the meadows by the
  waterside. He felt the surer when he reflected that this expedition, too, was
  not without danger. The land was the ground of a manor-house, watched by
  zealous gardeners and keepers, full of choice flowers and pleasant fruits as
  the garden of the Hesperides. He had once essayed the venture before and met
  with a sad discomfiture. While he kept the stream he had fared well enough,
  but it so fell out that in the meadow he espied a horse, and there his
  troubles began; for, approaching it in the Indian manner, he crawled under
  its belly in the most orthodox way, and proceeded delicately to mount it. The
  horse clearly was of no Indian breed, for it made off after sadly barking his
  shins. To add to it all, he had to flee homewards, limping across ploughed
  lands and through marshy woods, pursued by two irate grooms and a vociferous
  coachman. No. There was no lack of danger in that direction. So for form's
  sake he pulled his belt tighter, looked to the edge of his dagger and the
  point of his sword, and made a pretence of seeking the aid of Heaven in
  pious, knightly fashion.</p>

  <p>It was a gracious and comely land he entered upon. The clear water crooned
  among irises and white ranunculus or rippled across broad, shining shallows,
  or fell in a valorous plunge over a little cauld. There was no lack of fish,
  and had the Jacobite not been on high mission intent he would have thrown off
  his jacket and groped for trout beneath the banks. But not for him now were
  such sports. The yellow sunlight clothed the fields as in a cloth of gold,
  and from the midst great beech trees raised their masses of rich browns and
  cool greens. There were sheep there and horses, but he did not turn aside,
  for, like Ulysses, he had learned from misfortune. The place had an
  enchanting effect upon his spirits. It was like some domain in faery, the
  slumbrous forest which girt the sleeping princess, or the wood beyond the
  world. John Ridd was forgotten, and the Jacobite, forgetful of his special
  calling, had fled to regions beyond history. He was recalled of a sudden by
  an unlooked-for barrier to his progress. The stream issued from below a high
  weir, and unfriendly- looking walls barred its sides.</p>

  <p>Without an effort he rose to the occasion. Now was the opportunity for a
  master-mind, which had never yet met its match among the boys of his
  restricted acquaintance. He set himself tooth and nail to the wall.
  Projecting stone and mossy interstices gave him foothold. In a trice he had
  gained the top and was looking into a sort of refined Elysium, a paradise
  within a paradise. A broad pond had been formed by the stream, whereon sailed
  a swan and some brave- liveried ducks, and near whose margin floated
  water-lilies, yellow and white. Clean-shaven turf fell away from the edge,
  barred by the shadows of trees and bright in many places with half-opened
  heather. Beyond the water were little glades of the greenest grass, through
  which came a glimpse of stone and turret. The Jacobite's breath went quick
  and fast. Things were becoming, he felt, altogether too true to nature. He
  had come straight upon a castle without so much as a mishap. The burden of
  his good fortune bore heavily on him; and he was strongly tempted to retreat.
  But in the end romance prevailed; with wavering footsteps he crept along the
  edge, ready at a glance to flop among the reeds.</p>

  <p>But these violent tactics were not needed. Sleep seemed to have fallen
  upon the race of grooms and gardeners. Nothing stirred save a linnet, which
  came down to drink, and a moorhen which scuttled across the pool.
  Grasshoppers were chirping in the silence, and the faraway sound of a bell
  came clear and thin through the air. In a little he came to where the pond
  ceased and the stream began once more, not like the stream in the meadows
  below, but a slow, dark current among trees and steep mossy banks. Once more
  the adventurer's heart beat irresolutely; once more his courage prevailed. He
  scrambled below trailing branches, slipped oftentimes into the shallows, and
  rolled among red earth till the last vestige of green was gone from his
  corduroys. But harsh is the decree of fate. Again he came to a
  barrier&mdash;this time a waterfall of great sound and volume.</p>

  <p>Joy filled the heart of the Jacobite. This was the water-slide in the
  Bagworthy wood, and at the top must be the Doone's valley. So with boldness
  and skill he addressed himself to the ascent. I have no inkling what the real
  cascade in Devon is like, but I will take my oath it was not more perilous
  than this. The black rocks were slippery with ooze, few helping boughs of
  trees were at hand, and the pool at the bottom yawned horrific and deep. But
  the Jacobite was skilled in such breakneck ventures. With the ease of a
  practised climber he swung himself from one foothold to another till he
  gripped the great rock which stood midway in the stream just at the summit,
  and, dripping and triumphant, raised himself to the dry land.</p>

  <p>And there before him on a fallen trunk, in the most lovely dell that
  nature ever conceived, sat the Lady. For a moment the Jacobite,
  notwithstanding his expectations, was staggered. Then his training asserted
  itself. He pulled a torn cap from his head, and "I thought you would be
  here," said he.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said the Lady, with the curiosity of her sex, "and where do
  you come from?"</p>

  <p>The Jacobite reflected. It was only consistent with tradition, he felt, to
  give some account of himself. So he proceeded compendiously to explain his
  birth, his antecedents, his calling, and his adventures of the day. He was
  delighted with the princess now he had found her. She was tall and lithe,
  with hair like gold, and the most charming eyes. She wore a dress of white,
  like a true princess, and a great hat, made according to the most correct
  canons of romance. She had been reading in a little book, which lay face
  downward at her feet. He thought of all his special heroines, Helen of Troy
  and Ariadne, Joan of Arc, the Queen of Scots, Rosalind, and Amy Robsart, and
  that most hapless and beautiful of dames, the wife of the Secretary Murray.
  He inwardly decided that the lady was most like the last, which indeed was
  only fitting, seeing that tradition said that this place was once her home.
  "O, you delightful boy," said the Lady. "I never met any one like you before.
  Tell me what you think of me."</p>

  <p>"You're all right," said the wanderer, "only where do you come from? I
  hope you're not going to disappear."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," said she. "I come from a place to which you will go some
  day, a big, stupid town, where the finest and the worst things in the world
  are to be found. I'm here to escape from it for a little."</p>

  <p>The Jacobite was keenly interested in this account of his prospective
  dwelling- place.</p>

  <p>"What are the fine things?" he asked. "Ships and palaces and dogs and guns
  and&mdash;oh, you know what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "these things are there. And the people take very little
  interest in them. What they chiefly like is money."</p>

  <p>The Jacobite pulled out his halfpenny, and regarded it with critical
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she went on, "and lots of people don't go to bed much at night, but
  they put on fine clothes and go to other people's houses and have dinner and
  talk, even when they would rather be at home."</p>

  <p>The Jacobite looked philosophically at his clothes. They could not be
  called fine. He wasn't given to talking to people whom he didn't like, and he
  told the Lady so.</p>

  <p>"And there are others, who rule the country and don't know anything about
  it, and are only good for making long speeches."</p>

  <p>"But," said the Jacobite, incredulously, "don't they know how to fight, or
  how do they rule if they don't?"</p>

  <p>"They don't know how to fight," said the Lady sadly; "and more, they say
  fighting is wrong, and want to settle everything by talking."</p>

  <p>The Jacobite looked mournfully skyward. If this was true, his future was
  dismal indeed. He had much skill in fighting, but talk he held in deep
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"But there must be heaps of knights and cavaliers left; or are they all
  gone to heaven?" said he.</p>

  <p>The Lady sighed. "There are some, but very few, I am afraid. And these
  mostly go away to foreign lands, where there is still fighting, or they hunt
  lions and tigers, or they stay at home very sad. And people say there is no
  such place as heaven, but that all that is left for us when we die is a
  'period of sensationless, objective existence.' Do you know what that
  means?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the Jacobite, stoutly, "and I don't care. What awful rot!"</p>

  <p>"And they say that there never were such things as fairies, and that all
  the stories about Hector and Ulysses and William Tell and Arthur are
  nonsense. But we know better."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, "we know better. They're true to us, and it is only to
  stupids that they're not true."</p>

  <p>"Good," said the Lady. "There was once a man called Horace, who lived long
  ago, who said the same thing. You will read his book some day." And she
  repeated softly to herself,</p>

  <p class="verse">Prætulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,<br>
Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,<br>
Quam sapere et ringi.*</p>

<p class="footnote">
[* A dotard I had rather seem, and dull,<br>
Sooner my faults may please make me a gull,<br>
Than to be wise, and beat my vexed skull. &mdash;Horace.]</p>

  <p>But the Jacobite saw the slanting sun over the treetops, and he knew it
  was time to go home.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I must go," he said mournfully. "When I grow up I will stop
  all that nonsense. I will hang a lot of them and banish others, and then you
  will like it, won't you? Will you have some treacle toffy? It is very
  good."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the Lady, "it <i>is</i> good."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said he, "I will come and see you when I grow up and go to the
  place you spoke of."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sure you will," said she, and gave him her hand.</p>

  <p>He bent low and kissed it in true cavalier fashion.</p>

  <p>"There is the road up there," she said, "it's your quickest way." And she
  looked after him as he disappeared through the trees.</p>

  <p>The road ran east and west, and as the sun bent aslant it, it was one
  great belt of golden light. The Jacobite was wonderfully elated. What an
  afternoon he had had, just like a bit out of a book! Now there remained for
  him the three miles of a walk home; then tea with fresh butter and cakes such
  as his heart rejoiced in; and then the delights of taking the horses to
  drink, and riding his pony to the smithy. The prospect was soothing and
  serene. A mellow gaiety diffused through his being.</p>

  <p>And yet he could not get rid of the Lady's news. Ah! There was a true
  princess for you, one who agreed with him in everything; but how sad was the
  tale she told! Would he ever have to meet such misfortune? He felt that some
  day he would, and the notion pained him. But he turned back for a moment to
  look to the westward. The crimson heart of evening was glowing like a
  furnace; the long shafts of orange light were lengthening, and the
  apple-green was growing over the blue. Somehow or other the sight gave him
  heart. The valiant West, that home of El Dorados and golden cities, whither
  all the romance of life seems to flee, raised his sinking courage. He would,
  alone, like Douglas among the Saracens, lift the standard and rout all
  foolish and feeble folks. Some day, when he was great and tall, he would ride
  into the city where the Lady dwelt, and, after he had scattered her enemies,
  would marry her and live happy for evermore.</p>

  <p>That for the future. For the present home and tea and a summer
  evening.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; NIGHT ON THE HEATHER</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE are certain days in August when the air is soft and
  lucid, and the pale skies have a delicate fragility which is unknown at other
  times. The Lammas floods have worked their boisterous will and clarified
  earth and air, and the drenched meadows and abundant waters sleep under sober
  heavens. This is the first warning of the autumn, the fore-hint of frost and
  decline, but as yet these things are not; and to all wearied men there is a
  subtle peace in the harmonious monotony. In the lowlands there may be torrid
  heat and all the sultriness which one associates with the harvest month; but
  in the hill country a cool greyness is on nature.</p>

  <p>As if to make amends for the dearth of colour in the daytime, the evenings
  are extraordinarily splendid. Then the restraint is loosened and the colours
  of sunset are things for a man to remember with delight all his days. The
  world becomes jovial once more, and in the rich light all natural things grow
  hilarious. Birds sing with an unwonted fervour, as if they had entered on a
  second spring; flowers are fresher and more brilliant; the turf has a new
  elasticity; and in the streams the trout are on the alert for their evening
  meal. The earth dries quickly after the rains, and one may walk dryshod in
  the meadows by the great swollen waters, and find an enchanting union of
  spring and summer.</p>

  <p>On such a night the angler who has tried in vain in the daytime to allure
  the sluggish trout, goes out to his fishing with some good hope of success. I
  have spent many an hour in the morning and afternoon casting across the
  stream when water and sky seemed alike favourable; but only when the bright
  evening came had I any great sport. But it is still better to fish in the
  hours about midnight, for then the largest trout come to feed; and if you are
  not town-bred and over-dainty to sleep on the heather, you may make a great
  basket and see something of the mysteries of night, and dawn, and the
  sleeping world.</p>

  <p>One such evening I remember in the high glens about the source of Tweed,
  when I spent the night in the solemn fastnesses of the hills. Leaving a
  sleeping-rug in the shadow of a rock behind a belt of pines, with my rod and
  creel I went up a burn which loitered down a flat upland valley. The water
  was flooded and clear, and made a pleasant noise twining round the corner of
  a weather-stained rock or winding among odorous thickets of thyme. The
  quietness of the hills&mdash;so great that the most distant sounds fell
  distinctly on the ear and one heard the running of faraway waters&mdash;was
  enlivened by the gorgeous sunset light and the activity of bird and insect.
  The flash of brown bees, the wavering flight of snipe, the dart of
  water-ouzels, gave liveliness to the quiet valley. The hills stood out
  against the saffron sky, great violet-coloured shoulders and peaks, looking
  remote in the evening air. The wholesome smell of the moorlands, which stirs
  a man's blood strangely, had a lowland luxury in it from the crushed summer
  flowers.</p>

  <p>At every cast the flies, as they trailed on the surface, caught a glow
  from the sky and looked like dancing fireflies. The trout, when they rose or
  plashed in mere wantonness, made wide circles of light in the darkening
  water. The first fish landed on a spit of green land came out so quivering
  with a thousand colours that it seemed almost sacrilege to break his neck and
  put him in a common wicker creel. But the sport was good, and many gleaming
  trout, three or four to the pound, were brought dripping to the crisp
  heather. The gathering dusk made the stream the one vivid thing in the scene,
  inky in the shadow but living fire in the open places.</p>

  <p>A strident voice hailed me through the darkness, and I found beside me my
  excellent friend, the shepherd of the Redswirehead. His tall form seemed all
  but gigantic in the failing light, but his walk was sufficient to mark him
  far off. A rough grey plaid hung on his shoulders, his homespun clothes had a
  healthy smell of peat-reek, and his hand grasped a great horn-handled stick,
  which he dug into the earth as he walked. Clearly the stick was too old a
  companion to be left at home, for in his other hand he held a gun, and few
  men think it useful to carry both. He peered into my basket and nodded, for
  he was a man of few words. I looked at his gun and he answered my unspoken
  question. "Ay," said he, "it's an auld bitch fox that gave me sair work i'
  the lambin'- time. She's bidin' in a scrog o' birk on the hill there, and
  I'll hae a shot at her, though I should sit tae mornin'." I also was out for
  the night; I would come with him, for one fox was better in my eyes than many
  trout; so in a trice it was agreed that we two should keep watch on the hill
  and plot the death of this ancient mother of evil. In the upper parts of the
  Tweed valley this shooting of foxes is no crime but a necessity, for they
  make deadly havoc among the young lambs in the spring of the year. A price,
  too, may be had for the skins, and so it comes about that every mountain
  shepherd traps the young and shoots the old ones as enemies of his
  profession.</p>

  <p>I rolled in my line and made to put up the rod, but alas! the water had
  swelled the wood, and the joints, like the locks of Doubting Castle, went
  "damnable hard." The shepherd could no more move them than I, so perforce we
  had to leave it as it was and carry it aloft, like some pennon stript of its
  blazonry, to our quarters for the night. In the back of the pine-wood I found
  my rug, and there we gathered armfuls of dried twigs and some broken fir
  logs. With these we made for a little hollow half-sheltered by an out-jutting
  crag, but commanding a wide view of the glen. Below was the patch of birch
  and brackens where the miscreant fox lay hid. In a few minutes we had built
  and kindled a fire which cast a fluttering glow over the sombre hillside. The
  pine splinters crackled merrily, and in the red embers we placed the finest
  of our trout till they were browned to a nicety. Then we found each a seat on
  the heather and settled down for the night. I chose a bush in flower, but the
  shepherd stoically, and with an eye to his business, selected a harder couch
  looking steeply down on the valley.</p>

  <p>The great dappled hills in front, over which the sun had just set, were
  still fired with a ruddy light. A yellow afterglow was on the sky&mdash;a
  shifting, elusive light, which hung now over one hill and now on another,
  growing fainter with each passing minute. Darkness, like the clear blackness
  of a moss-pool, grew over the world, blotting out nothing from the landscape,
  but rather presenting all things in monotint, which before had been a richly
  coloured picture. "It's a comfortable sicht," said my friend, and indeed the
  whole scene, the sunset and the hills, the smell of heather and burning wood,
  and the low cries of wild birds had a delicate comfort in them.</p>

  <p>The shepherd talked, as only such a man can, of many things, of fishing
  and shooting, of the hills, of the people of the place, of old-world times.
  His racy speech, so accurate and expressive, seemed wonderful to one
  accustomed to the inanity of civilised talk. The moorland shepherds are a
  fine set of men&mdash;I know few finer. With seeing eyes and understanding
  hearts they go about their duties, battling with fickle weather, inured to
  danger and discomfort, seeing a little of the wonders of the earth. Life for
  them is no colourless existence, but varied and full as any man's. The quiet
  of retired glens and summer valleys is known to them, the fury of winter
  among snow-clad hills, the gladness of a returning spring; and in their
  every-day life they must travel to lowland markets and meet with men from the
  four corners of Britain. In their own way they have some share of
  book-culture, for in the long nights they have ample leisure for reading.
  Many have a tincture of theological learning; some go further afield and try
  the subtleties of philosophy. One man I remember, a shepherd on a lonely
  mountain farm, who by some strange chance had got together some of Hamilton's
  books, and was a vehement follower of Sir William. He used to meet me often
  by the waterside, and would reason and dispute with the relish of a
  Schoolman. In the interests of my fishing I schemed for his overthrow so one
  evening I boldly propounded the most advanced Hegelian views. I shall never
  forget the expression of incredulous disgust on the man's face. Thereafter I
  avoided the hill on which he made his rounds; ethics lurked in the hollows of
  his glen; nay, there was something metaphysical in the very swirl of his
  dog's tail.</p>

  <p>The man at my side was of a different type. His learning concerned other
  things; the ways of the wind, the vagaries of bird and beast, the art of
  fishing in difficult weather. It was his boast that he could walk by night in
  a snowstorm to any place in Tweeddale. He was a veritable mine of knowledge
  on every feathered thing that had ever been seen on his hills. Few things
  pleased him more than to hear of the birds of the sea-coast, which he knew by
  their rare winter visits to the moors. The great flocks passing southward in
  the autumn had a romantic interest in his eyes, coming from their distant
  northern breeding-places, tarrying a little, then hastening onward to unknown
  lands. He would lie out o' nights among frozen bogs to get a shot at a flock
  of wild geese or a stray swan, and count it the height of pleasure. He was
  one of the two men I have ever known who could tell the time to within a
  quarter of an hour by the sky. The other was an enterprising drover who
  ultimately fell out with the law of the land and betook himself to easier
  latitudes.</p>

  <p>The shepherd lit his pipe and smoked with a composed pleasure. I care
  little indeed for the odour of the finer kinds, but I dearly love the smell
  of bad tobacco. There is something about it at once so wild and homelike,
  recalling warm fires and desolate peat-bogs, fishermen and sailors and gipsy
  caravans, storms and summer days, keen-eyed, weather-beaten fellows, and all
  the things which give zest and savour to life. From your choicer kinds for
  the life of me I can get no associations beyond stifling thoroughfares and
  vacant young men.</p>

  <p>As the evening grew late the birds of the moorland ceased their quavering
  concert, and except the bolder sorts, the rough-riders and moss-troopers of
  the clan, lay still in the heather. Brown owls hooted and fluttered overhead,
  and we heard at intervals the long, measured sweep of their wings. A few
  belated curlews piped in their melancholy way, answered from the far distance
  by the restless call of the plover. Night, which gives weirdness to familiar
  things, lends a new note, a strange, uncanny one, to the cries of birds. A
  thrush screaming through the thicket in the daytime is a lively thing, but at
  night he is a shadow, an eldritch apparition, a startler of calm. If this be
  true of homely birds, it holds still more with the wild creatures which cry
  ceaselessly over the hills. At night in the dead silence they make the
  wayfarer think of kelpies and brownies and a whole mythology of malignant
  spirits.</p>

  <p>We heard the sound of a weasel from the whin bushes below. A flock of
  sheep, affrighted by something or other, crowded together and ran aimlessly
  along the slope. All else was quiet save for a few rustling winds, which blew
  down the side glens and stirred the thicker darkness of the valley. Tweed
  could scarce be discerned&mdash;a black line with quivering points of light
  from the marsh fires on its banks. A faint smell of heather blooms and damp
  moss filled the air, varied by the strong whiffs from the shepherd's
  pipe.</p>

  <p>A strange pleasure, a man might say, to be perched like a crow on a gaunt
  hillside among rough moors and uniform ridges, and truly if it be put in this
  hard way, the pleasure seems scarce in evidence. But to one who has lived his
  life among these haunted valleys, the old grey hills and bare glens are
  splendid in the fair light of romance, and every bald rock is dearer than the
  richest flower-garden. The birds of the place are old associates; the whistle
  of a curlew is to him the choicest music; the soft ripple of the Tweed is a
  perennial and delectable interest. Fantastic sentiment it may be; but
  sentiment better than reason. It was a great saying of De Lisle Adam's,
  "<i>Sans illusion tout peint</i>." For all that each man holds dearest may
  seem illusion to another; and what in all times have been thought of the
  highest value&mdash;the mysteries of faith, insight and joy in nature, the
  fitful path of honour, the pleasures of life and motion, of thought and
  imagery, of art and music&mdash;may be called by this name by a cold and
  practical people. Like Corin, we are in a "parlous state," when honest
  sentiment and generous illusion serve only as matter for scorn and
  reproach.</p>

  <p>The shepherd lay stretching his great length with his eye still fixed on
  the birches. I was moved to wonder by the size and powerful look of the man,
  and could scarce refrain from saying, as I regarded him with drowsy eyes,
  "You're a big man, shepherd; there are few like you nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Ay," said he, "and d'ye ken, some inspector body came up the glen to look
  at my hoose, and he was aye threepin' that the rooms were far ower sma', and
  that it was unhealthy past a' tellin'. So I just lookit at the cratur, and
  says I, 'My man, I could mak three o' ye, ony day, and I was brocht up in a
  room sae wee that I couldna get on my coat withoot stappin' my airm up the
  lum.'"</p>

  <p>It must have been far on in the night, when I was startled from sleep by a
  loud report, which awoke the echoes from every hill, and with half-opened
  eyes saw the shepherd fling away an empty cartridge and lay down his gun. A
  yellow blur at the far end of the thicket marked where the old fox had met
  her fate. Her executioner stretched his limbs, yawned mightily, and, settling
  himself among the deep heather, was asleep almost before the smell of smoke
  had died away in the air.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE true time of awakening is just before sunrise, as the
  real sleeping-time is a little before sunset. Then the world awakes, and in
  the activity of life around sleep is impossible. As we, scarce fully aroused,
  looked down from our perch on the valley, we felt the indefinable feeling of
  life returning. A rustle among the heather, a swaying and tossing of birches,
  a louder murmuring of streams, the first shrill pipe of a moorland
  bird&mdash;all told of a renewal of energy, an electric thrill passing
  through the earth. The air was cold and fresh, and over the opposite hills
  the grey fore-glow of the dawn was spreading. A white mist clung to the low
  grounds, making the fields seem deep in snow; but above on the brown and
  purple shoulders the faint light fluttered among deep shadows. It was a
  strange and beautiful sight for any man to witness, as the early sun sent his
  first shafts through the spaces of the hills, waking chill splendours among
  pines and wildwood. In his train came the pomp of many-tinted clouds, of long
  vistas of light and shadow, an affluence of riotous imagery, tempered and
  chastened by the cold pallor which still held the uplands. The darkness of
  the sky changed imperceptibly to a lucid blue, which each new light flushed
  with rare colour. Then suddenly the distant fields and cornlands caught the
  sun, and the golden sheaves and green, shorn meadows were flooded with a
  dazzling brilliance. The remote distances became clear, and down the valley
  woodlands a score of miles away grew as vivid as the grass at our feet. But
  the grim hills still kept darkness in their nooks, though their summits were
  flaming like beacons.</p>

  <p>The birds awoke, and a twittering and singing filled the glen. Larks with
  their high trills, desultory pipits, curlews, snipe, ill-fated grouse,
  lackadaisical plovers made the moor lively with their varied notes. A hawk
  sailed high bent on some morning foray, and so clear was the air that it was
  possible for us to see the motion of his wings. The whole hillside seemed
  alert with life; only the black ashes of our fire were left to remind us of
  the silent dark.</p>

  <p>"Let's try a cast wi' your rod i' the burn," said the shepherd; "there's a
  great troot i' the pool below the brig. We micht grip him." So we went down
  by rocks and brackens, and stunted trees to the green, lawn-like turf by the
  stream. Here we must needs walk with caution, for the rain had made the
  waters high, and in places a turbulent current had overpassed its banks and
  left treacherous marshes for unwary fishermen. Below the wooden foot-bridge a
  great pool was formed by a little fall&mdash;black and girt with masses of
  scented fern which dipped in the swirling eddies.</p>

  <p>The shepherd went stealthily forward, and dropped a fly in a space of
  still water. Twice he cast in the place, but still his lure remained
  unheeded; then in the whirl at the foot, but with no better success. Once
  again he cast in an eddy below the further bank, and now he had a mighty
  rise. His fly sank and darted down stream, then up again to the rough water,
  where he had much ado to keep the fish from grating his line on a jagged
  rock. For full ten minutes the contest lasted, until he drew it, spent and
  unresisting, to a patch of shingle, and brought it to the grass&mdash;a
  shapely trout of near a pound's weight, delicately marked and glittering in
  the cold sun.</p>

  <p>"On my word, master," I said, "this is a gallant trout; what shall we do
  with him?"</p>

  <p>"Dae wi' him?" quoth the shepherd, who was ignorant of Walton, though he
  gave me the very answer which Piscator gave to Viator on that May morning
  long ago, "hae him to your breakfast. He'll cut red, and taste like a
  saumon."</p>

  <p>So I put him in the creel and together we went down the valley. At the
  foot of his glen my friend halted. "I maun awa'" said he. "I've my sheep to
  look, and a wheen lambs to fauld; syne I maun ower to Megget to meet a man
  wi' twae score o' yows. I've mair to dae than fish, and lie among the hills.
  So guid mornin' to ye, and I'll see ye anither nicht."</p>

  <p>The road went down by the babbling stream, among heather and bog, till the
  waters grew quieter, and green fields appeared, and larks were commoner than
  curlews. Then past banks of harebells and white yarrow and great red clover,
  and beech hedges with leaves just tinged with the red of autumn. The sweet-
  scented moor hay lay in swathes by the waterside, and there was a gallant
  show of yellow corn sheaves above the stubble. Late-flowering meadow-sweet
  lined the ditches; sneeze-wort, ragweed, and many flowers of unpleasing names
  but rare colours made a gay little world by the roadside. In front lay
  homesteads among trees, and lowland meadows, and still waters, a rich
  country, smiling and peaceful; but the choicer scene was behind, where the
  giant hills, purple and grey and black, lifted their foreheads to the pure
  skies.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; ON CADEMUIR HILL</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE gamekeeper of Cademuir strode in leisurely fashion over
  the green side of the hill. The bright chilly morning was past, and the heat
  had all but begun; but he had lain long a-bed, deeming that life was too
  short at the best, and there was little need to hurry it over. He was a man
  of a bold carriage, with the indescribable air of one whose life is connected
  with sport and rough moors. A steady grey eye and a clean chin were his best
  features; otherwise, he was of the ordinary make of a man, looking like one
  born for neither good nor evil in any high degree. The sunlight danced around
  him, and flickered among the brackens; and though it was an everyday sight
  with him, he was pleased, and felt cheerful, just like any wild animal on a
  bright day. If he had had his dog with him, he would have sworn at it to show
  his pleasure; as it was, he contented himself with whistling "The Linton
  Ploughman," and setting his heels deep into the soft green moss.</p>

  <p>The day was early and his way was long, for he purposed to go up Manor
  Water to the shepherd's house about a matter of some foxes. It might be ten
  miles, it might be more; and the keeper was in no great haste, for there was
  abundant time to get his dinner and a smoke with the herd, and then come back
  in the cool of the evening; for it was summer-time, when men of his class
  have their holiday. Two miles more, and he would strike the highway; he could
  see it even now coiling beneath the straight sides of the glen. There it was
  easy walking, and he would get on quickly; but now he might take his time. So
  he lit his pipe, and looked complacently around him.</p>

  <p>At the turn of the hill, where a strip of wood runs up the slope, he
  stopped, and a dark shadow came over his face. This was the place where, not
  two weeks ago, he had chased a poacher, and but for the fellow's skill in
  doubling, would have caught him. He cursed the whole tribe in his heart. They
  were the bane of his easy life. They came at night, and took him out on the
  bleak hillside when he should have been in his bed. They might have a trap
  there even now. He would go and see, for it was not two hundred yards from
  his path.</p>

  <p>So he climbed up the little howe in the hill beside the firwood, where the
  long thickets of rushes, and the rabbit-warrens made a happy hunting-ground
  for the enemies of the law. A snipe or two flew up as he approached, and a
  legion of rabbits scurried into their holes. He had all but given up the
  quest, when the gleam of something among the long grass caught his attention,
  and in a trice he had pulled back the herbage, and disclosed a neatly set and
  well- constructed trap.</p>

  <p>It was a very admirable trap. He had never seen one like it; so in a sort
  of angry exultation, as he thought of how he would spoil this fine game, he
  knelt down to examine it. It was no mere running noose, but of strong steel,
  and firmly fixed to the trunk of an old tree. No unhappy pheasant would ever
  move it, were its feet once caught in its strong teeth. He felt the iron with
  his hand, feeling down the sides for the spring; when suddenly with a horrid
  snap the thing closed on him, pinning his hand below the mid-finger, and he
  was powerless. The pain was terrible, agonising. His hand burned like white
  fire, and every nerve of his body tingled. With his left hand he attempted to
  loosen it, but the spring was so well concealed, that he could not find it.
  Perhaps, too, he may have lost his wits, for in any great suffering the brain
  is seldom clear. After a few minutes of feeble searching and tugging, every
  motion of which gave agony to his imprisoned hand, he gave it up, and, in
  something very like panic, sought for his knife to try to cut the trap loose
  from the trunk. And now a fresh terror awaited him, for he found that he had
  no knife; he had left it in another coat, which was in his room at home. With
  a sigh of infinite pain, he stopped the search, and stared drearily before
  him.</p>

  <p>He confusedly considered his position. He was fixed with no possibility of
  escape, some two miles from the track of any chance passer-by. They would not
  look for him at home until the evening, and the shepherd at Manor did not
  know of his coming. Some one might be on the hill, but then this howe was on
  a remote side where few ever came, unless their duty brought them. Below him
  in the valley was the road with some white cottages beside it. There were
  women in those houses, living and moving not far from him; they might see him
  if he were to wave something as a signal. But then, he reflected with a
  groan, that though he could see their dwellings, they could not see him, for
  he was hidden by the shoulder of the hill.</p>

  <p>Once more he made one frantic effort to escape, but it was unsuccessful.
  Then he leant back upon the heather, gnawing his lips to help him to endure
  the agony of the wound. He was a strong man, broad and sinewy, and where a
  weaker might have swooned, he was left to endure the burden of a painful
  consciousness. Again he thought of escape. The man who had set the trap must
  come to see it, but it might not be that day, nor the next. He pictured his
  friends hunting up and down Manor Water, every pool and wood; passing and re-
  passing not two hundred yards from where he was lying dead, or worse than
  dead. His mind grew sick at the thought, and he had almost fainted in spite
  of his strength.</p>

  <p>Then he fell into a panic, the terror of rough "hard-handed men, which
  never laboured in their mind." His brain whirled, his eyes were stelled, and
  a shiver shook him like a reed. He puzzled over his past life, feeling, in a
  dim way, that it had not been as it should be. He had been drunk often; he
  had not been over-careful of the name of the Almighty; was not this some sort
  of retribution? He strove to pray, but he could think of no words. He had
  been at church last Sunday, and he tried to think of what he had heard; but
  try as he would, nothing came to his mind, but the chorus of a drinking-song
  he had often heard sung in the public-house at Peebles:</p>

  <p class="verse">When the hoose is rinnin' round about,<br>
It's time eneuch to flit;<br>
For we've lippened aye to Providence,<br>
And sae will we yet.</p>

  <p>The irony of the words did not strike him; but fervently, feverishly, he
  repeated them, as if for the price of his soul.</p>

  <p>The fit passed, and a wild frenzy of rage took him. He cursed like a
  fiend, and yelled horrible menaces upon the still air. If he had the man who
  set this trap, he would strangle the life out of him here on this spot. No,
  that was too merciful. He would force his arm into the trap, and take him to
  some lonely place where never a human being came from one year's end to the
  other. Then he would let him die, and come to gloat over his suffering. With
  every turn of his body he wrenched his hand, and with every wrench, he yelled
  more madly, till he lay back exhausted, and the green hills were left again
  in peace.</p>

  <p>Then he slept a sleep which was half a swoon, for maybe an hour, though to
  him it seemed like ages. He seemed to be dead, and in torment; and the place
  of his torment was this same hillside. On the brae face, a thousand evil
  spirits were mocking his anguish, and not only his hand, but his whole body
  was imprisoned in a remorseless trap. He felt the keen steel crush through
  his bones, like a spade through a frosted turnip. He woke screaming with
  nameless dread, looking on every side for the infernal faces of his dreams,
  but seeing nothing but a little chaffinch hopping across the turf.</p>

  <p>Then came for him a long period of slow, despairing agony. The hot air
  glowed, and the fierce sun beat upon his face. A thousand insects hummed
  about him, bees and butterflies and little hill-moths. The wholesome smell of
  thyme and bent was all about him, and every now and then a little breeze
  broke the stillness, and sent a ripple over the grass. The genial warmth
  seemed stifling; his head ached, and his breath came in sudden gasps. An
  overpowering thirst came upon him, and his tongue was like a burnt stick in
  his mouth. Not ten feet off, a little burn danced over a minute cascade. He
  could see the dust of spray, which wet the cool green rushes. The pleasant
  tinkle sang in his ears, and mocked his fever. He tried to think of snow and
  ice and cold water, but his brain refused to do its part, and he could get
  nothing but an intolerable void.</p>

  <p>Far across the valley, the great forehead of Dollar Law raised itself,
  austere and lofty. To his unquiet sight, it seemed as if it rolled over on
  Scrape, and the two played pranks among the lower hills beyond. The idea came
  to him, how singularly unpleasant it would be for the people
  there&mdash;among them a shepherd to whom he owed two pounds. He would be
  crushed to powder, and there would be no more of the debt at any rate. Then a
  text from the Scriptures came to haunt him, something, he could scarce tell
  exactly, about the hills and mountains leaping like rams. Here it was
  realised before his very eyes. Below him, in the peaceful valley, Manor Water
  seemed to be wrinkled across it, like a scrawl from the pen of a bad writer.
  When a bird flew past, or a hare started from its form, he screamed with
  terror, and all the wholesome sights of a summer day were wrought by his
  frenzied brain into terrible phantoms. So true is it that Natura Benigna and
  Natura Maligna may walk hand in hand upon the same hillside.</p>

  <p>Then came the time when the strings of the reason are all but snapped, and
  a man becomes maudlin. He thought of his young wife, not six weeks married,
  and grieved over her approaching sorrow. He wept unnatural tears, which, if
  any one had been there to see him, would have been far more terrible than his
  frantic ravings. He pictured to himself in gruesome detail, the finding of
  his body, how his wife would sob, and his friends would shake their heads,
  and swear that he had been an honest fellow, and that it was a pity that he
  was away. The place would soon forget him; his wife would marry again; his
  dogs would get a new master, and he&mdash;ay, that was the question, where
  would he be? and a new dread took him, as he thought of the fate which might
  await him. The unlettered man, in his times of dire necessity, has nothing to
  go back upon but a mind full of vivid traditions, which are the most
  merciless of things.</p>

  <p>It might be about three or four o'clock but by the clock in his brain it
  was weeks later, that he suffered that last and awful pain, which any one who
  has met it once, would walk to the end of the earth to avoid. The world
  shrank away from him; his wits forsook him; and he cried out, till the lonely
  rocks rang, and the whaups mingled their startled cries with his. With a last
  effort, he crushed down his head with his unwounded hand upon the tree-trunk,
  till blessed unconsciousness took him into her merciful embrace.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">AT nine o'clock that evening, a ragged, unshorn man, with
  the look of one not well at ease with the world, crept up the little
  plantation. He had a sack on his back for his ill-gotten plunder, and a
  mighty stick in case of a chance encounter. He visited his traps, hidden away
  in little nooks, where no man might find them, and it would have seemed as if
  trade were brisk, for his sack was heavy, and his air was cheerful. He looked
  out from behind the dyke at his last snare carefully, as behoved one in
  danger; and then with a start he crouched, for he saw the figure of a
  man.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it; it was his bitterest enemy, the keeper of
  Cademuir. He made as if to crawl away, when by chance he looked again. The
  man lay very still. A minute later he had rushed forward with a white face,
  and was working as if for his life.</p>

  <p>In half an hour two men might have been seen in that little glen. One,
  with a grey, sickened face, was gazing vacantly around him, with the look of
  some one awakened from a long sleep. By dint of much toil, and half a bottle
  of brandy, he had been brought back from what was like to have been the
  longest sleep he had ever taken. Beside him on the grass, with wild eyes, sat
  the poacher, shedding hysterical tears. "Dae onything ye like wi' me," he was
  saying, "kick me or kill me, an' am ready. I'll gang to jail wi' ye, to
  Peebles or the Calton, an' no say a word. But oh! ma God, I thocht ye were
  bye wi't."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; AN INDIVIDUALIST</h2>

  <p>THE afternoon was fast waning to twilight, and the man who for the last
  few hours had been alternately sleeping in the heather and dabbling in the
  rocky pools of the burn awoke to the consciousness of time. He rose and
  looked around him. Hills crowded upon hills, blue, purple, and black; distant
  spaces of green meadow; barren pines waving desolately on a scarp; many
  streams falling in a chain of cascades to the glens; and over all a June sky,
  clear, deep, and tender. The place was goodly, and the idleness which is
  inseparable from the true enjoyment of afternoon weather dragged heavily upon
  him to keep him where he was.</p>

  <p>He had come out that morn with his mind a chaos of many cares. Projects,
  fragments of wise and foolish thoughts, a thousand half-conceptions, had
  crowded upon him thick and fast, for the habit of unceasing mental toil is
  not shaken off in an hour. But June and the near presence of great hills are
  wondrous correctives; they are like an inverted spy-glass, which makes large
  things seem of the smallest; and ere long he found himself aimless and
  thoughtless. The drift of clouds, the twitter of mountain linnets, seemed all
  in the world of moment, and he would have gladly bartered his many plans for
  some share in this wild lore. And so for that clay there was one pervert from
  the gospel of success in life, till lengthening shadows came and he gathered
  together his wits and laughed at his folly.</p>

  <p>With lingering regrets he set off homewards, and the vista before him was
  one of work awaiting and a whole host of anxieties. Yet for once in a while
  he had been at peace, and to don the harness again was not so repellent, now
  that he had found how it could be shaken off at will. So he went along the
  grassy hill- path whistling an old air, till he had gained the edge of the
  decline, and lo! before him went another wayfarer.</p>

  <p>It was the figure of a man about the middle height, with a forward stoop,
  and a walk which was neither shuffle nor stride, but the elegant lounge of
  the idler. His general aspect was one of breeding and ease; it was not till a
  nearer approach that one perceived the contradiction of the details. For all
  things about him were in rags, from the torn cap to the fragmentary shoes,
  and the pristine excellence of the cloth only served to accentuate its
  present state of defection. He also whistled as he walked, and his roving
  eyes devoured the manifold landscape. Then some other mood seemed to take
  him, and he flung himself on the short hill grass, lying back with his head
  on his hands.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the other's footsteps he sat up and greeted him.</p>

  <p>"Good-day," said the tramp, civilly. "Do you go far?" Then, as if he had
  forgotten himself, he went back to his Scots. "I was wonderin' if ye could
  tell me the time o' day, sir," he said, hastily.</p>

  <p>The other stopped short and looked at the stranger before him. Something
  in his frank eye and strange appearance attracted him, for he did not go on,
  but glanced at his watch and sat down beside him. Darkness was not yet, and
  the air was as soft as mid-day.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes there was silence, and the one broke it with a laugh. "I
  seem to have come into a new land to-day," he said. "All things have seemed
  enchanted, and I scarcely know whether I am sleeping or waking. I suppose it
  is the weather and those great hills." And even as he spoke he found himself
  wondering at himself for speaking thus in such company.</p>

  <p>But the other reassured him. "Good," said he, and again he dropped the
  dialect. "At last I have found some one like-minded. You are
  a&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am a man of affairs, busy from year's end to year's end. For eleven
  months I am chained, but for once in a while I am free. And
  you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Oh I," and the tramp laughed. "Ulysses, you know. A wanderer is man from
  his birth. I see we have not so much in common."</p>

  <p>"No," said the other, "I am afraid we have not. You see I believe really
  at the bottom of my heart in getting on in life, and doing one's duty, and
  that sort of thing. I see that you have no such prejudices."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," and the tramp whistled lackadaisically. "It's all a
  question of nature. Some men&mdash;well, some, you know, are born to be good
  citizens. Others lack the domestic virtues. How does the thing go?</p>

  <p class="verse">'Non illum tectis ullae, non moenibus urbes<br>
  Accepere, neque ipse manus feritate dedisset,<br>
  Pastorum et solis exegit montibus aevum.'</p><br>

  <p>"Brunck emends the passage, but the words are good as they are. In them
  you have my character and watchword."</p>

  <p>"It is the character of many," said the other. "We can all hear the Piper
  if we listen, but some of us stop our ears against him. For myself, this hill
  air makes me daft, and the smell of heather and burning wood, and the sound
  of water and the wind. I can sympathise with you. And now I am going back to
  toil, and it will be very hard for days, till the routine lays its spell over
  me once more."</p>

  <p>"And for what good?" asked the wayfarer. "I apologise for asking you the
  foolish question, but it is the inevitable one in my philosophy."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the other, "I can scarcely tell. For the sake of feeling that
  one is fighting in the ranks of life and not skulking from the battle line;
  that one is doing the work for which God has given him talents; to know that
  one is mixing with men, and playing his part well in the human tragi-comedy.
  These reasons and many others."</p>

  <p>"Hum," said the tramp. "Again I must say, 'temper of mind.' You will
  excuse me if I say that they do not commend themselves to me. I cannot see
  the necessity for making the world a battlefield. It is a pilgrimage, if you
  like, where it is a man's duty and best wisdom to choose the easiest course.
  All the pleasure in life can be got apart from the turmoil of the
  market-place&mdash;love and kindness, the taste of bread to a hungry man and
  water to a thirsty, the delight of rest when tired, and the pleasure of
  motion when fresh and alert, and, above all, the thousand things of
  nature."</p>

  <p>"You chose the life? You were not born to it?"</p>

  <p>"Born to it?" and the wayfarer laughed again. "No, I was very little born
  to it. I shall not trouble you with my story, it is too old-fashioned to
  amuse you. I had good prospects, as people say, but, as I have said, I lacked
  the civil virtues. I was too restless to stay long anywhere and too rich to
  have any need, and the upshot of it all is&mdash;this!" And he fingered
  lovingly the multiform rents in his coat.</p>

  <p>Below them, as they talked, ran the sandy hill-road, with its white gravel
  glistening in the westering sunlight. Far down lay a cottage, which was as
  clear as if it had been not a score of yards away. Thither a man was walking,
  a shepherd in his Sabbath clothes, who had been to the country town and was
  returning laden with many parcels. Distant as it was, the whole scene lay
  plain before the two. A child, a little girl, ran from the cottage at her
  father's approach, and clung lovingly to his knee. Then with childish
  strength she clutched a package, and in another second the pair had entered
  the house. By some simultaneous impulse both men had directed their eyes to
  the place and had seen the whole of the little comedy.</p>

  <p>And lo! to the other's amazement the tramp's eyes glistened as he
  looked.</p>

  <p>"You do not believe in the domestic virtues?" said the one very
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Not I," said the tramp. "I have told you that I don't. The essence of
  social life, civil and domestic, is bearing one another's burdens and sharing
  one another's pleasures. I am an individualist with all my heart. I grant you
  things would come to a pretty pass if all were of my way of thinking; but
  there&mdash;it is a matter of temperament, and such temperaments are
  scarce."</p>

  <p>"Is it not," said his interrogator, "the old question whether man or
  nature is the more productive study? You cannot maintain that these hills
  afford the same view-ground of character as the city and the bustle of life.
  I speak solely as a spectator. I do not even ask you to go down and mix with
  the crowd and taste its life." And there seemed no incongruity in talking
  thus to the man of the wayside and many tatters.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the other. "God forbid that I should talk so callously of
  the sorrows and toils of my fellows. I do not seek to scrutinise the
  character of others. All my concern is with myself. It is not a man's duty to
  seek out his kind and strive with them and live among them. All that he must
  do is to play his part well as he may chance upon them. It is not richness
  and fulness of life that I want. I am not ambitious. Ease, <i>ataraxia</i>,
  you know, is enough for me."</p>

  <p>"But the rewards?" said the one, questioningly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the rewards! You cannot know them." And the man's voice took a new
  tone. His eyes lit up, and, looking over the darkening valley, he spoke to
  his comrade many things, and sang in his ear ever so sweetly the "Song of the
  Open Road." He told of the changes of the season&mdash;the rigours of winter,
  the early flush of spring, the mellow joys of summer, and autumn with her
  pomp and decay. He told of clear starlit nights, when the hill breezes blow
  over the moors and the birds wake the sleeper; of windy mornings, when the
  mist trails from the hills and dun clouds scud across the sky; of long hot
  days in the heather among the odours of thyme and bog-myrtle and the lark's
  clear song. Then he changed his tune, and spoke of the old romance of the
  wayside, that romance which gipsies and wanderers feel, of motion amid rest,
  of ease in the hurry of the seasons, of progress over the hills and far away,
  into that land unknown which dawns upon the sight with each new morrow. And
  he spoke, too, of the human element in it all which is so dear to the man
  versed in its mysteries, of heroism amid the sordid, the pathetic in the
  coarse, the kindly in the most repulsive. And as he spoke he grew eloquent
  with it all, and his hearer marvelled at such words, till he looked away from
  the rags to the keen, eager face, and then he marvelled no more.</p>

  <p>But by this time the darkness had all but come, and the speaker cut
  himself short, laughing at his own rhetoric.</p>

  <p>"Losh, it's comin' on for nicht," he said, speaking broadly, as if to
  point a contrast, "and time slips by when ye get on the crack. I'll hae to be
  movin' if I'm to win to Jock Rorison's the nicht. I aye bide wi' Jock, when
  I'm hereaways, if I dinna sleep ootbye. Will ye be gaun doun the road?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I go by that way too. I'll be glad to accompany you;" and the two
  went down the winding path together. Overhead the stars, faint with haze,
  winked and glittered; and below in the valley a light or two shone out from
  the blue darkness. The soft, fragrant night airs rustled over the heather,
  and borne on them came the faint twitter of sleepy birds. To one of the pair
  all seemed so new, so strange, that it was like an excerpt from the caliph's
  journal. The wondrous natural loveliness around seemed to be a fitting
  environment for the strange being at his side; and he reflected somewhat
  ruefully as he walked that what folk call the romance of life springs in the
  main from people of hot heads and ill-balanced judgments, who seek to put
  their imperfect, immature little philosophies into action.</p>

  <p>They stopped at the first wayside cottage, and the tramp knocked. The door
  was opened by a grave-faced woman, for in these uplands the sharp air seems
  to form the human countenance into a passive mould. But at the sight of the
  man her eyes brightened and she half-offered admittance.</p>

  <p>"I'm no comin' in the now," he explained. "I juist ca'ed as I passed to
  tell ye that as I cam' bye the schule at Callowa', the maister gave me a
  wheen buiks to tak' to your laddie."</p>

  <p>"Thank ye, and it's rale guid o' ye to bring them. He's awfu' keen o' the
  readin', and gettin' on uncommon weel. It's a wunnerfu' thing eddication; how
  it mak's a thing different to some folk. But of course you, that never kenned
  what it was, canna understand it in the same way."</p>

  <p>"No," said the tramp humbly, "we canna, but it's a wunnerfu' thing. Na,
  I'll no come in. Gude nicht," and again they took the road.</p>

  <p>By the time they crossed the water the darkness had fairly come, and a
  bright horn rose behind the pines. Somewhere in thicket a bird sang&mdash;no
  nightingale&mdash; and the two men stopped to listen. Beyond lay the little
  hamlet of a dozen houses, a rambling, tangled clachan, looking grey and
  ghostlike in the night.</p>

  <p>At one door he knocked and a man came, an old man bent with age and toil
  who greeted them kindly.</p>

  <p>"I juist cam' frae your son," the visitor explained. "I gave him a ca' in
  as I was passin'. He's verra weel, and he bade me tell ye that he's comin'
  ower the morn's week to see ye. I was to tell ye, tae, that he's sold his
  hoggs at twenty-seven, and that he's bocht Crichope yins this 'ear."</p>

  <p>Again he halted, and this time it was at a very little dwelling somewhat
  beyond the others, standing alone in its garden of gooseberry and marigold.
  This time the man who waited at the gate saw a pretty, slim lass stand in the
  doorway, who blushed at the message which was brought her. For her lover
  lived many a mile over the hills and saw her but every second Sabbath, so
  their primitive love-letters were sent by word of mouth. And sometimes there
  came a present from the market town, and there went back something knitted by
  the girl's own fair fingers; and so the harmless comedy was played, as it is
  played and will be played all the world over.</p>

  <p>Once more the two went on their way, the one silent, the other humming a
  light country catch. The mind of the one was occupied with many problems,
  among them that hard one of the adjustment of a man to his neighbours, and
  the place of ambition in the scale of the virtues. Somehow or other his pride
  of intellect, of strength, seemed to be deserting him, and in its place there
  came a better feeling, humble and kindly, a sense that the world is full of
  more things than any man has ever writ in black and white.</p>

  <p>But now it was the cross-road where their paths were severed. They had
  known each other a bare hour, and now they were the fastest friends. At
  parting the one shook the other's hand. "You are a very pretty kind of
  individualist," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE DROVE ROAD</h2>

  <p>In the southern shires of Scotland, the country between the Forth and the
  Carlisle Eden, the traveller may see here and there a green scar on a
  hillside, a broadly-marked tract of grass in a glen of heather, or a fenced
  strip of no- man's land among orderly meadows. And if he look further he will
  find that these patches have continuity, and that, though broken by highways
  and growing villages, they form a clear path, which runs up hill and down
  dale with no care for obstruction. This is the Drove Road, the way once used
  more than all the others when market-roads were rough and ill-kept and barred
  with toll-gates. There are many branches of it. One may find them in every
  lowland Scottish shire, sometimes to all appearances at cross purposes with
  one another. But all are feeders of one great central path, running from
  Falkirk through the shire of Linlithgow, skirting the county of Lanark,
  passing over the head of Tweeddale into Yarrow, and thence on through the
  Ettrick and Liddesdale moorlands to the English border.</p>

  <p>The history of it goes back to the days when Falkirk Tryst was the great
  market of Scotland to which resorted drovers and dealers from the South. The
  crofters of Ross and Sutherland, the sheep-farmers of Inverness, Perth and
  Argyle, brought their sheep and cattle thither, and men from the Western
  islands drove herds of little shaggy kyloes to swell the fair and the
  confusion. Bargains were made amid jabber of Gaelic and much Saxon profanity;
  and the purchasers took their way with shouting of men and dogs out of the
  town and over the great drove-road. By this green thoroughfare the herds
  crossed the Border, by its branches they penetrated into the far lands of
  Galloway and the West; and though now the noise of the lowing of beast and
  the cries of man have gone, it still lies silent and barren, a memorial of
  the unremembered dead.</p>

  <p>To-day, what with cattle trucks and reduced fares, the transition of stock
  is easy and unromantic. It seems scarcely conceivable to us that days, weeks
  were spent on the road and vast discomfort put upon the drover and his charge
  ere the graziers of Northumberland could trade with the farmers of Lochaber.
  Droving in the grand style is a trade for which the demand has ceased, and
  its former practitioners, if they be still in the land of the living, have
  gone to swell the ranks of the butchers and shepherds. It was a hard
  existence, and doubtless, if they have found some easier calling, they do not
  regret its decease; but it means the loss of one more picturesque, if
  disorderly, profession,&mdash;and the sentimentalist is always with us.</p>

  <p>Yet it is but yesterday that it has gone, for the yearly passing of the
  droves is within the memory of even young men in the Scots lowlands. Many can
  still be found to bear witness to the light and shadow of the life, to laugh
  over its humours and lament its decay. And from their tales a vivid picture
  can be constructed, a patch of rough old-world romance in our somewhat
  languid civilisation. There were the fairs, held for the most part on the
  bare moors, the seas of tossing shaggy frontlets, the flocks of black-faced
  sheep, sore tired with travel, the booths and merry-go-rounds, jugglers and
  quacks, the collies hovering unceasingly round the outskirts, and the motley
  concourse of men. The shepherd from the Lews with his dozen words of English
  chaffered with the sleek Leicestershire grazier. The Highland laird, with his
  overweening pride of gentrice, rubbed shoulders with the southern farmer. The
  scum and following of the North fought with the scum and following of the
  South, and the dogs swelled the tumult. At the darkening there were great
  fires whereat many slept, and the autumn night was made hideous with
  carousals. Then when all was over the two races separated, the one with coats
  buttoned over dirty pocket- books and their Donalds and Malcolms full of
  whisky and sweet memories, the other to the south by coach, leaving their
  hired drovers to bring on the purchased herds.</p>

  <p>The drovers themselves were a class having grades and distinctions of
  merit. A man tried and proved would readily find a master, whereas the baser
  sort were engaged by the poor man, who found that prudence is only consistent
  with a full purse. These were a daring, godless race, deep drinkers all, fond
  of brawls and quick as fire to take offence. They were hardy too, sleeping
  often out-of-doors and enduring the sternest rigours of our uncertain
  northern weather. I have one before my eyes as I write, a tall oldish man,
  something between a groom and a grazier, profoundly learned in the ways of
  horses and dogs, one who had seen something of the world and had tried many
  trades. His figure was well known, as with his plaid wrapped round his
  shoulders and his peaked cap pulled over his brow, he drove his flocks into
  the village in the short autumn twilight. When once these had found shelter
  in the stackyard of some hospitable farmer, he would seek the public-house,
  and hold forth to his admirers. To the villagers, before the days of
  railroads and the penny postage, he was a link of connection with the outer
  world, a strenuous element in their sleepy lives. Year after year the man
  would come with his stories, till his step was not so firm nor his eye so
  clear to watch his charge. Then his journeys would cease, and the drover
  retire to end his days in the back streets of the city.</p>

  <p>As a class they had their good qualities, which one should acknowledge all
  the more readily for their comparative rarity. They were in general worthy of
  every confidence, trusty, bold in defending their master s property,
  unwearying in their toil if aught went amiss. They were kindly after their
  fashion and would often go far to help one of their number whose luck was
  worse than their own. Of their dogs they were considerate as only one who
  knew the value of a good dog could be, and if times were hard they would
  share their last crust with the companion of so many wanderings. On the other
  hand, they were certainly the most quarrelsome tribe in existence. Fighting
  both with fists and knives was an every-day occurrence, not only at great
  fairs, but at any little halting-place on the way where two of them chanced
  to foregather. Their drinking bouts were long and deep; they would gamble
  away their hardly-earned wages in a night; and if they were honest in the
  main where their master's interests were concerned, the same could not be
  said of their dealings with one another. The drover was both feared and liked
  along his way, for if he was open-handed with his money, he would strike down
  the man who dared to gainsay him; and if he was dangerous in his liquor, at
  other times he was the most delightful of comrades.</p>

  <p>The life of a drover was well-nigh as risky as a blockade-runner's,
  without the honour. In the days when the trade was at its height, the country
  was unsettled and blackguards of all descriptions waited on the path of him
  who was known to have money about his person or goods of value in his charge.
  The drover's way took him over wild moors where human dwellings were few, so
  that he was in a far more perilous case than any highway traveller. It was
  the custom for some dozen of boys and idlers to attend a flock from the town
  on the first few miles of the road. Here lay the thief's chance. He might
  talk with the drover, learn of his dealings in the market, and of the
  direction of his homeward way. If the man were new to the trade, he would
  soon learn all he wanted, and it would be a matter of conjecture whether that
  flock ever reached its destination. But this element of peril merely
  strengthened the bold, vigorous natures among them, so that often a scoundrel
  found the object of his attentions his match in cunning and a good man of his
  hands to boot. Many a Homeric combat took place in the solitudes of the
  roads, with no witness but the dogs and sheep. But this continuous living in
  danger made many of them hard men, chary of speech, trusting no more than was
  needful, and believing most folk villains till they proved the contrary. In
  the inn-kitchen of a night, when the sheep or cattle were safely housed and
  the hardships of the day's march at an end, it was only to his tried comrades
  that the drover was confidential. He was quick to glance at any new-comer,
  drinking silently by himself in the chimney-corner, alert and watchful.</p>

  <p>I have heard one story of these days, which borders on the gruesome, but
  which, coming as it does from the times of Burke and Hare, may very well be
  true. A drover came from Edinburgh to an inn in Tweeddale, having much money
  in his breast-pocket, and a following of some half-dozen town
  good-for-naughts at his heels. He slept the night in a bedroom on the ground
  floor, locking the door and taking every precaution. In the early morning the
  innkeeper heard a noise from the place, which made him force the door, and to
  his horror he found the drover dead, stabbed to the heart. An open window
  pointed to the means by which death had visited him. The place was lonely.
  There were no men about save the ostlers, and they had drunk too deeply the
  night before to be of any use. The city was not twenty miles away, so thither
  the host set out to tell his tale. He had walked some seven miles of the
  road, so the story goes, when a gig overtook him in which sat three men. It
  was one of the old-fashioned farmers conveyances, wide enough to seat four
  abreast and ponderous as a cart. They stopped and offered him a lift which he
  gratefully accepted, and he sat down next the middle man of the three. The
  other two talked gaily and laughed, but the man on his left uttered not one
  word. They had gone maybe two miles when our friend said casually that "his
  neebor on the left was verra quiet," and as he spoke looked in his face. With
  a sickening terror he recognised that it was no other than the man who had
  been murdered not two hours before in his own house, lashed to the gig and
  presenting a ghastly semblance of life. With his brain on fire with sheer
  terror, he dealt the man on his right one tremendous blow, leaped over the
  wheels, fell headlong, was on his feet in a trice and running homeward for
  dear life. He reached the inn, and lo! the body of his guest was gone, and
  from that hour he heard no more of gig or drover.</p>

  <p>But now the men have passed away and their memory has gone to add one more
  to the romances of the old green road. And romance it is in truth, for the
  men who came there were of all sorts, from broken Highland bonnet-lairds to
  Tweeddale shepherds. By this path came Rob Roy ere he began his escapades,
  and while he still was Mr. Robert Campbell, and a decent gentleman-drover.
  One remembers the inimitable account of his calling which the Baillie gave to
  Francis Osbaldistone. "Nae name better ken'd between the Lennox and
  Breadalbane. Robin was anes a weel-doing, pains-taking drover, as ye wad see
  among ten thousand. It was a pleasure to see him in his belted plaid and
  brogues, wi' his target at his back, and claymore and dirk at his belt,
  following a hundred Highland stots, and a dozen o' the gillies, as rough and
  ragged as the beasts they drave. And he was baith civil and just in his
  dealings; and if he thought his chapman had made a hard bargain, he wad gie
  him a luck-penny to the mends. I hae ken'd him gie back five shillings out o'
  the pund sterling." It was by this way likewise, if all tales be true, that
  Davie Balfour footed it from Kirk- Essendean to the House o' Shaws to claim
  his inheritance and set out on his adventures&mdash;a raw boy, ill-clad and
  homely, not yet the friend of Alan Breck, and still unaware of Catriona.</p>

  <p>But the tangible relics of the past are few and far apart. Sheep pass by
  this road on their way to local markets, but it is rarely indeed that flocks
  come from more distant places. Perhaps once in a while a drove may come, and
  then it is somewhat belated and out of place. In the old days when great
  roaring herds of cattle came through the villages, it was a sight worth the
  seeing. For days, maybe, the Brig of Peebles would be all but blocked, and
  little boys coming home from school would be sadly delayed and go dinnerless.
  Now this is gone, and at best you may see a few poor dozen of beasts in front
  of a towsy man. At night you chance to see a light on the drove-road, and,
  going near, find that it is the apology for a camp fire, by which the drovers
  sleep, while their charge lie silent around them. Early in the morning they
  are gone, and one may wait a score of months for their successors.</p>

  <p>So if the human interest of the road lies but in memory, we are perforce
  driven to the natural side, its protean beauty and the charms which come to
  it from the "living air and the blue sky." It has been unfilled for
  centuries. No man possesses it, though all have the right of way and pasture;
  so its face remains unchanged since cateran and kyloe passed over it. It is
  not like other roads in avoiding the rough places and skirting hills. It
  fears but one thing in the world&mdash;a peat bog; for the rest it goes
  straight over the summit of ridges, climbs the barest hillsides, and in
  general goes as the crow flies across the land. It is this indomitable
  feature which gives it much of its peculiar charm, for in a short six miles
  by this path a man may have a taste of as many varieties of scenery. Now it
  is on the high lands, and the grass is short and springy, the heath deep, and
  a great grey rock juts up every now and then through a tangle of blackberries
  and heather. Grouse haunt it, strutting at evening on its slopes; and the
  hill-sheep stray thither, seeking fresh pasture. Behind and before there is a
  landscape wide to the eye, and the fresh hill air makes the place a delight
  to the beholder. I have said that the men who first used it were lavish of
  human labour, for when by a little detour a steep ridge might have been
  saved, the road, scorning such compromise, dips from the hill-top sheer down
  into the glen, and then toils painfully up the further side.</p>

  <p>But in a few miles all is changed. We find ourselves in a lowland valley
  among meadows and green woods, where the road runs evenly between hedges. In
  such a place too often it tends to merge itself in the highway, but in
  certain parts it is still intact. Here the grass is ranker, and the
  cottager's cow makes its living along it. In one place of my acquaintance it
  plunges into a deep pinewood, and passes through, a green ribbon between inky
  borders. Rabbits now frequent it, and partridge coveys rise startled from its
  sides. Often it is clothed with great tracts of whin, which make the way
  uneasy for the walker. The golden broom, too, in its season flames from the
  hedgerows, and in spring the grass is white with the petals of the hawthorn.
  Sometimes in these parts the road suddenly approaches a village, and little
  cottages spring up beside its track. Then it becomes in the language of the
  folk a "loan" or "loaning," and the chosen playground of children.</p>

  <p>Many are the delights of the place to the man of leisure who has time to
  linger often by it. The charms of old association are there, a thousand
  memories of the past, clearer and more tangible than those which attend other
  relics of age, inasmuch as the past in this instance borders so nearly with
  the present. Then there are the more peculiar pleasures of the way, which
  lures a man on to follow its winding course, promising new beauty round every
  turning. There is a pathetic story of some French prisoners at Peebles, in
  the opening of the century, who were permitted to take their daily walk to
  the first milestone on the western road. This lay just before the gorge at
  Neidpath, so the noble view of the valley, which is got when one has passed
  it, was not for them. But they, poor fellows, longed so ardently for the
  forbidden sight, that by a united conspiracy they lifted the milestone and
  carried it round the corner. So, too, on this drove-road, we are all like
  these Frenchmen, we cannot rest till we see for ourselves what lies over yon
  ridge or round yonder clump of trees. So we go on and ever on, heedless of
  meals and the passing of time. Which is a fact alike in Tweedside topography
  and the conduct of life. For is not half our action prompted by a restless
  desire to scan the horizon and look over hill-tops?</p>

  <p>One may lie a long summer's day on the grass in perfect quietness, and see
  nothing but the life of the fields. In spring, if anything, it is somewhat
  bleak, for the bent is still grey from the winter cold, and the air is often
  not a little chill. But in summer it is one long strip of El Dorado, the
  chosen haunt of birds and a very garden of flowers. The long whistle of the
  curlew and the mellow lark are there, and on the ground underfoot milkwort
  and eyebright, mountain-pansies yellow and blue, and the little stars of the
  grass of Parnassus light up the green with colour. The singular, half-acrid
  smell of the hills is sweetened with languid thyme; and the noise of bees
  fills the drowsy air. In autumn come the red heather and the black
  blaeberries, and now is the time of golden and russet tints on leaf and
  stalk. Then succeeds winter, when all is deserted, when not even a sheep
  comes thither, but snowdrifts fill the hollows and a sharp frost holds burn
  and moss.</p>

  <p>For the road is deserted as few can be said to be in our populous times.
  Not many travel by it. You may meet, perhaps, a shepherd striding homewards
  to some outlying cottage, or a ploughman going to meet his sweetheart.
  Sometimes even you light on a belated tourist who cares naught for the place
  and curses its asperity. But for the most part you are left alone to lord it
  over all in solitary magnificence. But the land is haunted by a thousand
  memories. Here in this quiet spot they are united and focussed for the
  wanderer, till the past is inextricably blended with the present. And still a
  man may fancy that he hears on this green, unvisited way the bleating of
  sheep, the menace of visionary dogs, and the confused speech of drovers who
  have long since ceased from their toil.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; NUCES RELICTAE</h2>

  <p class="verse">Iam tristis nucibus puer relictis<br>
  Clamoso revocatur a magistro.</p><br>

  <p>SO Martial; and in the quaint-sounding words we may still find much
  curious meaning. The little scene is outlined for us, the clamant teacher and
  the reluctant boy dragged wofully back with many a glance at relinquished
  pleasures. The picture and the phrase are as old as the world, for indeed one
  may guess that life is one long process of bright holidays, sudden and sharp
  leave-takings and windy schoolmasters.</p>

  <p>The nuces of childhood have passed into such a piece of obvious phrasing
  that the real truth of the matter is glossed over. One is apt to talk glibly
  of the pleasures of youth, thinking of it as some hey-day of merriment
  boisterous and undiscerning. Certain pieces of popular literature have given
  a sanction to this view of childhood as a boy's game, played lightly and soon
  forgotten. How false it is one need scarcely tell, for if it were true the
  poets and romancers of all time must have been in a singular error. The
  sports and follies of the early period of life are as little the essence of
  it, as the frivolity of an Antony is a sure index of his heart. If we would
  seek to find the well-spring of youth, we must needs seek it in more retired
  places than by the common highway. The staple of childhood is in all
  likelihood its games; but if these were all, then few would have that longing
  for its renewal that is supposed to be an every-day thing among us.</p>

  <p>"I was driven," says Coleridge in recalling his experience, "from life in
  motion to life in thought and sensation;" and in this word the master forgot
  for an instant his penetration. If thought and sensation did not exist in
  childhood, it would indeed be a colourless and empty stage in our journey,
  and the sooner we were past it the better. But this is hardly worth the
  arguing, so palpable it must be to all that one of the dominant charms of the
  dawn of life lies in its fantastic dreams and vivid sensation. Any one who
  has known something of child nature has observed the quick curious thought,
  the strange imagining, the sensitive perception of little things, which lurk
  in the unformed mind. He may have been puzzled by a shrewd question or amazed
  by a daring image, or delighted by a phrase which, all unknown to its little
  maker, has much in it of that quality which men call truth. Or perhaps, if he
  has gone much abroad with them and had a full confessional, he may have
  learned how keen are their perceptions of scenery and weather in a thousand
  nice shades and distinctions.</p>

  <p>This in truth is an old commonplace in books. <i>Consilia juventutis</i>,
  says Bacon, <i>plus divinitatis habent;</i> the thoughts of youth have
  something more divine about them. Schiller has spoken wise words of the
  reverence due to the dreams of childhood. Henry Vaughan, the Silurist, in his
  <i>Retreate</i>, has a true sense of the value of the unfettered thoughts of
  a boy.</p>

  <p class="verse">Happy those early days, when I<br>
  Shin'd in my Angell infancy,<br>
  Before I understood the place<br>
  Appointed for my second race,<br>
  Or taught my soul to fancy aught<br>
  But a white celestial thought,<br>
  When yet I had not walked above<br>
  A mile or two from my first love.</p>

  <p class="verse">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="verse">O how I long to travell back,<br>
  And tread again that ancient track<br>
  That I might once more reach the plaine,<br>
  Where first I left my glorious traine,<br>
  From which the Inlightened spirit sees<br>
  That shady City of Palme-trees.</p>
  <br>

  <p><i>Before I understood</i>&mdash;this is the key of the whole matter. With
  a little knowledge and a wide outlook a child sees strange things in the
  world. The dwellers in this castle of indolence do not busy themselves with
  reflection, but look about them with a full expectation of great things to be
  seen and high words to be heard. It is only when the dull time of instruction
  has set in and ousted the days of wise fancy that this freshness vanishes,
  and in its place we find a dry body of facts, a bleared vision and a heart
  with little gaiety. The child lives in a fairyland, and looks for adventure
  every hour and by every meadow; and if the light of common day is fit for
  nothing but to show their gold to be dross, why, then, they who dwell always
  in its hard glare are much to be pitied.</p>

  <p>The time of childhood is the time of knight-errantry in thought and
  action. Prudence is at a discount, and the imagination rules supreme in her
  neighbour's territory. To any reasonable-minded child the world is a vast
  enchanter's garden, full of rare sights and brave deeds awaiting his coming.
  Men and women that he has read of live in his actual world, and every scene
  is peopled for him with some figure of the story-teller's. A choice
  uncertainty is never absent from his mind, for how does he know what a day is
  to bring forth? An older man, to whom all things are fixed in a stiff
  routine, may have good cause to complain of the monotonous rhythm of life;
  but in the child's case, it is no ordered music which he hears, but a gay
  dance, full of starts and variations and quick surprises. The glamour of his
  fancy is on common things, so that in a curious sense the greatest and the
  littlest minds are alike; for we have it on the best authority that he is the
  great poet who can read the trivialities of this existence in the light of
  another, which is higher and better and afar off.</p>

  <p>Nature is the child's first wonder and his most constant playmate. The
  seasons in their changing bring him a ceaseless round of new fancies; and
  days and nights conspire together for his delectation. In a garden he has a
  kingdom of his own, and feels a sense of possession in the neat flower-beds
  and well- trimmed borders. But once outside of it and he is an adventurer,
  who sets forth with as fluttering hopes as any Spaniard who went a-hunting
  for an El Dorado. A wood is a deep dark abode of horrors and delights. The
  heavy shadows are treasure-houses and the aisles of tree-trunks are always
  awaiting the fit explorer. In winter the long reaches of barren land, the
  silence of snow, the ice glittering among rushes awaken dreams of Northmen
  and wild deeds, of the Snow Queen and her fairy train, and vast, still
  forests, where the silence is broken only by the falling of leaves. In
  summer-time among the long-backed moorlands his thoughts take another form.
  He is all for the old chivalrous tales, for ringing bridles and clattering
  swords, captive maids and ill-won cattle. Who shall tell the ways of a
  romantic boy among the quiet hills in the idle days? Autumn, too, when the
  red is in the woods and he is brought from play in a world lighted by the
  fires of sunset into the warm hearth and lamp- lit room, is a season of
  countless memories. He feels the waning of summer more vividly than any of
  his elders, and anticipates with joy the return of violent weather, for his
  mind is a medley of pleasant fragments of the past, which he would believe
  the future about to repeat.</p>

  <p>The sea has for him all the magic that it had for the Iceland men who
  stood by its brink and thought of lands to the westward. The pungent smell of
  salt air, seaweed on the hull of a ship, the flutter of white
  sails&mdash;these are the emblems of a mighty power which he looks at with
  bright-eyed wonder. The little ripples of water on the sand are the couriers
  of that great ocean on which are battles and black piracy, treasure-galleons
  and far-away summer isles. He sets himself with apish fidelity to go
  a-cruising on his own account in the garden pond or a little, brackish inlet;
  and no one can gauge the ecstasy which he may get from two feet of water and
  a rotten tub. Apart, too, from the mere tradition, he has the keenest delight
  in the large air and unshackled wind. The long, shifting lines of water, the
  race of the tides, the arc of sky dipping down to the curve of sea are parcel
  of his enjoyment. . A boat's track of a morning in the green water is of the
  essence of romance; a fisherman is a Jason; and he himself when he stands on
  an outlying rock and looks seaward is no other than Cortes staring from his
  watch-tower at the Pacific.</p>

  <p>In the more shadowy world of books and their creations, the child's
  outlook is as singularly clear. A tale is not apprehended in its dull truth,
  but in an airy fashion with all manner of new detail and original scenery.
  What the little folk desire is the raw stuff of romance, not woven into
  texture by any man's hand; a bare fabric, to vary the image, which they may
  adorn as it pleases them. This is the source of the deathless fame of
  "Crusoe" and the "Arabian Nights," of "Grimm," and the gentlemen who indite
  facile romances of Indians and slavers. This is why the jewel-work of
  Andersen is seldom estimated at anything like its worth by a child's mind.
  Give him the figures and the story and he will furnish the setting. Nay,
  more; each of his horses will step down from the books and bear him company
  for weeks. There is no lightly come by, lightly gone; for his loves in
  literature are cherished so well that they linger long into after days.</p>

  <p>Again, in the fantastic associations woven around these bare heroes and
  inartistic deeds there is often a shrewd guess at the truth. Let me take an
  instance from memory. There was once a child, who in his youth laid hold of a
  book of Greek myths and travelled for the first time in that land of gold.
  The stories held him captive. He dreamed of them night and day; he lived for
  a time in a world wholly unlike anything that he had ever heard of. Then he
  was sent to school, where he learned to read the histories which had
  delighted him in their proper tongues; but somehow the glamour had fled. They
  were no more to him now than a chapter in the history of England. But in time
  he became deeply learned in the classical literatures, and was able to enter
  with wonderful success into the arcana of the study. Then, he has told me,
  gradually he felt his perceptions grow keener; daily he elicited more beauty;
  until at last he found himself possessed in some degree of the power of
  living again in these old times. And to his wonder the truth, which he had
  reached by a toilsome bypath, was in no way different from the baseless
  dreams of his boyhood.</p>

  <p>The process of romance-making goes on as merrily around such grown-up
  members of his species as come across his path. A man with an odd face or a
  strange carriage is straightway the centre of a tale and an episode in the
  child's life. He is by no means a discriminating person; it is all one to him
  whether the hero of his creations be a sailor smacking of tar and the sea; a
  dusty miller; a farmer brown with sun and upland air; or a common tailor's
  apprentice. It is surprising with how equal a vision a child looks forth on
  life. He has no unreasoning prejudices&mdash;these are the heritage of later
  days&mdash; and few things are common in his eyes. The unconquerable young
  idealist, with brain on fire and glances in the ends of the earth, makes many
  a mountain out of a molehill, and (who knows?) perhaps now and then discovers
  a prince when others see only a pauper.</p>

  <p>Nor is it only the more earthy and tangible that he pictures in the
  show-room of his brain. He dearly loves the vivid world, but he is not averse
  at times to dreams of another kind. Unsubstantial visions, quaint thoughts,
  curious gleams of insight and delicacy, and with it all an uncanny mysticism,
  if one can use a hard word for a thing so simple, go to make up his rag-tag
  mind. To many children in their fits of thoughtfulness have come sights, like
  Dante's, of some Beata Beatrix, perhaps the fugitive remembrance of a face
  dimly seen in a crowd, or perhaps woven only from their fancy. Or perhaps it
  is a dream of landscape, a garden of the Hesperides, or the Delectable
  Mountains, where he reigns as king, with his playmates as courtiers; or
  perhaps something still more distant, a corner of green meadow, an upland
  glen washed with fresh rains, or a thin ridge of mountain&mdash;dim memories
  which please and perplex his waking thought. No one may fully tell of these
  figments of the brain; but I should hazard a guess that they make no little
  part of the nuces of childhood. All children are poets and artists, rhyming
  in their own way to whimsical music; for human nature, like the fabled statue
  of Memnon, has many songs at sunrise.</p>

  <p>So much for vague speculation. Yet in the disordered crowd of a boy's
  dreams, we may discern, I fancy, two notable features. He is all for the
  past, the bond slave of associations, hustled about by every vagrant memory.
  It is indeed curious to mark how lovingly a child will think on his bygones,
  recalling every feature of the way he has travelled, and seeking aids to
  memory in every circumstance of life. Then, again, he is cognisant of the
  present in an eager, wondering fashion; always on the alert for new
  experience; a seeker after hid treasure, confident of the issue and flushed
  with hope. These are, it seems to me, the twin and kindred graces of
  childhood&mdash;bondage to the past, and high expectation for the future.</p>

  <p>For, to be the slave of yesterday is, not to speak it flippantly, to be
  the lord of today and master of to-morrow. To be tenderly affectioned to the
  past is the surest way of becoming tolerant of the present, and he who has
  reached this height is not wont to be despondent about the rest of the
  journey. Which brings us to our second virtue, the fresh, receptive manner of
  regarding life. Now this is surely a matter of which we may all take heed. A
  child is not gifted with overmuch judgment, so he must needs be often
  perplexed with conflicting sensations, experience incommensurate with his
  mind. We who are somewhat bigger, if in no way better, in mental capacity,
  have no such evil to fight with; so what hinders us from reaping a richer
  harvest of impressions? The world is before us, and we have eyes and a
  makeshift for a brain; and yet we are dull and see only a brick wall instead
  of a summer garden.</p>

  <p>From one of the wisest books of our generation I take a sentence which
  tells with singular truth the sum of the whole matter. "Surely, the aim of a
  true philosophy must be, not in futile efforts toward the complete
  accommodation of man to the circumstances in which he chances to find
  himself, but in the maintenance of a kind of ingenuous discontent, in the
  face of the very highest achievement; the unclouded and receptive soul
  quitting the world finally, with the same fresh wonder with which it had
  entered it still unimpaired." It is a fatal error to settle on our lees, for
  the very essence of living is continuous discovery, a divine unrest which
  would urge a man to make trial of all things, and taste some variety of pain
  and pleasure.</p>

  <p>To put away childish things, like Mr. Worldly Wiseman, is to die before
  our time, to cut <i>off</i> our resources at their best. Then we shall become
  a race of cross-grained nonentities, sorrowfully raking among the dust-heaps
  instead of lifting our eyes to look at the sun. The pageant of life is
  enacted without our knowing it; the valiant procession goes by and we scarce
  raise our heads; and at the end we shall be cast into our graves more arid
  than the headstones. But the man who is childlike in heart to the end will go
  through the world like a pilgrim in a romantic country, cheerful and singing
  as he goes. For in truth it is a brave world, full of proud cities and still
  pastures, woods and waters, noteworthy deeds and great-hearted men; and he
  who can see no comeliness in it is tenfold worse than the blind man, whom
  Christian and Hopeful saw groping feebly among the tombs within call of the
  shepherds and the wholesome hills.</p>

  <p>To adopt this childlike view of life is to act to some purpose and with
  some hope of good return. For the truth lies not in the thing, but in the eye
  with which we regard it; and as all things are yellow to the jaundiced, so to
  the hopeful all is golden and many-coloured. One might live in a dismal alley
  and find food for joy; another in a flower-garden might dwell as in Egyptian
  darkness. I am tempted to set down a story as an illustration. In Tweeddale
  there is a trim village, Skirling by name, called by the country-folk
  Skarlin'. Here some years since there lived an old man, who had remained in
  the place from his boyhood, and in his later years had lost all continuity of
  memory. He would take strangers to see the little sights of the hamlet, and
  treat them, as they went, to his moralising. "Ay," he would say, "it's a
  bonny bit place. I've nae faut to find wi' 't; but oh! it's no yae half as
  braw as where I bide mysel';" and on being asked what this favoured spot
  might be, he would invariably reply, "A place they ca' Skarlin'." So it is
  with the most of us. We live in a dreary land and bemoan our fates, while all
  the while the great earth goes on its way, and life&mdash;odd, noble,
  picturesque&mdash;surges past, and we never see it.</p>

  <p>It is almost enough to drive one out of all patience to hear men, who shut
  themselves up in cloisters, venting their spleen upon things which they must
  of necessity know little about. It is but rarely that you find an active,
  lively man, a drover, a sailor, or a traveller, in the slough of despond.
  Thus it should be with all of us, if we could but cast the scales from our
  eyes and look out upon things with clear and faithful hope. But it is never
  to be, and so we go on dreaming of a new heaven and a new earth, until we
  waken some fine morning to find our dreams realised&mdash;and lo! the change
  is not in the world but in ourselves.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;Browning: <i>The Flight of the Duchess</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE thought of death even to the more valiant has in it
  something of affright and natural terror. Or if this be wanting, as is the
  case with the more high and valorous natures, there is a certain repugnance,
  shyness, strangeness, as of one entering upon a difficult and scarcely
  discerned path. But if one accustom himself to it, this shrinking departs,
  and the one fear left is that of the trappings and unseemly attendants of the
  last scene. Indeed, but for these loathly surroundings, the great enemy has
  few terrors for the better half of mankind.</p>

  <p>In past days this modicum of the awful was lessened by the way in which a
  man met death. It was not the rule for the life's breath to ebb away below a
  counterpane, or on a bed in the cover of a house. More common was the windy
  moor, the bustling fray, the deep sea or the grim front of battle. There,
  one's day was ended with a certain freshness and spirit. There were the
  surroundings of the clear air and the great wide face of the sky, the
  heartening of his fellows, and the hot, swift aid of passion. Then it was all
  by before a thought could be given, and the soul winged its way to whatever
  might await it unsicklied with the morbid expectation of its release. It was
  through this that men loved war well and held their lives at a feather's
  value, and toyed with the great enemy like true cavaliers. The growth of
  domesticity and funereal anticipation means, alas! the decadence of high
  valour and brave carelessness. For it is a written law that he who lives some
  years in a dreadful looking-for of judgment, becomes chicken-hearted and goes
  whimpering to meet it; whereas, had it come to him by surprise in the
  ordinary course of life, he would have greeted it like a man.</p>

  <p>It may be said, indeed, that such fortitude is but the bravery of
  ignorance, and that he is the better who meets unflinchingly what he has
  awaited with fear. But, alas, it is one of the traits of this last and
  greatest fear that it unnerves and unfits for such wise heroism. Man, whose
  breath is in his nostrils, has no choice in the matter. Let him once give
  himself up to this life of morbid contemplation, and his doom is decreed. To
  think of the latter end is indeed the worst of doctrines, the most pernicious
  of maxims.</p>

  <p>For us now in these days of peace and civilised ease, the violent death is
  the exception and the slow ebbing the rule. And how to prevent the stream of
  life from sinking miserably in dust-heaps, and cause it to flow free to the
  plunge, is a problem which might well gravely concern the greatest. Well for
  us that the answer is easy and to our hand. Instead of the physical
  vigilance, we must preserve the activity of mind and spirit. He whose aim is
  high, whose mark is in the clouds, who presses hot-foot on the race, will
  make light of the sudden darkness which obscures his aim for the moment, the
  sudden ditch into which he stumbles ere he can climb up the other side. He
  has no thought of death. He cares not a jot for negatives when he has the
  burning positive of fiery energy within him; and, confident of immortality,
  he lays aside the mortal and passes beneath the archway. And so he goes, not
  groaning farewells and nevermores, but rather with some gallant and cheerful
  <i>au revoir</i>&mdash;"till I return."</p>

  <p>Be sure, says Bacon, that the sweetest canticle is <i>Nunc Dimittis.</i>
  And sweet it is, as a holiday in the midst of work, as a pause in the course
  of a long race. But it is only such if the race and the work be there, if the
  spirit is still willing though the flesh be weak, and the warm impulses of
  life have never faltered. When a man has once this high spirit, though he be
  in poverty and rags at his day's ending, though his record is of failure, and
  his remembrance of sorrow, yet surely will he go to death as to a bridal and
  sing his canticle among the ashes.</p>
