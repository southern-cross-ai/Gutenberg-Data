<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">MR. AMOS LEE MAPPIN was breakfasting by the fire
in the immense living room of his apartment. With the steam heat,
a fire was not in the least necessary, but he enjoyed it. The
date was November 4th. During the pleasant fall days it was Lee's
habit to turn off the steam, open the windows and toast himself
in front of the cheerful blaze. "I am a primitive creature," he
would say, which was one of his innocent affectations. Nothing
could have been farther from the truth.</p>

<p>He was wearing a crimson damask dressing gown with a blue silk
scarf around his throat and blue morocco slippers. His taste in
dress ran to such flamboyant effects but, conscious that they sat
rather comically on his little, roly-poly figure, he sported them
only in the privacy of the home. He nibbled his grilled kidney
and sipped his coffee in great peace of mind. His big book, "The
Psychology of Murder," was progressing well. He was revolving the
day's work in his mind while he ate, and occasionally put down
his knife and fork to make a note in his little pocketbook.</p>

<p>Since he had become famous, somebody was always trying to
engage his services in this case or that. Being as fastidious as
a cat, he hated to soil his paws with the actual investigation of
crime; his job, as he told himself over and over, was to study
crime in the privacy of the library a long time after it had been
committed. So he refused all offers, however tempting the fee; he
didn't need the money; nevertheless, every now and then such
pressure was brought upon him that he was forced to take a case.
When he had solved the mystery he always drew a sigh of relief
and vowed that it should be the last. At the moment there was no
important criminal case to agitate the public mind and he
envisioned a long succession of serene days to be devoted to his
philosophical treatise.</p>

<p>His servant, Jermyn, tall, lean, leathery and correct, entered
bringing the <i>Herald Tribune</i>, which he placed folded upon
the table beside the breakfast tray. Jermyn did not speak, but he
had been working for Mr. Mappin for a long time, and his master
could read him like a printed page. It was evident from Jermyn's
overcasual air that there was something in the morning's paper
that he considered it important his master should see. He left
the room.</p>

<p>Opening the paper, Mr. Mappin saw at once what it was. Jules
Gartrey, the prominent banker, president of the famous Hasbrouck
firm, had been found shot dead in his apartment and the police
were looking for young Alastair Yohe, society's pet photographer.
Mrs. Gartrey, whom they called "the most beautiful woman in New
York," was said to be "prostrated."</p>

<p>Mr. Mappin threw the paper aside pettishly. The vulgarest of
crimes! He was annoyed that Jermyn should have supposed he would
be interested. Of course, it would cause a terrific sensation
because of the conspicuousness of the principals. Mappin hated
empty sensationalism. He disdained to read the details.</p>

<p>Putting it out of mind, he finished eating and went out on the
balcony to bask in the morning sun while he smoked a cigarette.
The East River sparkled far below; it was pleasant to think of
the fascinating, baffling problems of human conduct that formed
the subject matter of his book. Not this commonplace killing.
Afterwards he went to his room to dress. For the street he
affected a modified early nineteenth-century style. With his bald
head, his polished glasses, his round belly under a white
waistcoat, his neat legs encased in tightish pants, he looked
like Mr. Pickwick as Cruikshank drew him, and gloried in it. He
couldn't go all the way with Mr. Pickwick's costume; that would
have made him too conspicuous. He hated to be stared at.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his office on Murray Hill the heads of both
his assistants, blonde Fanny Parran and brunette Judy Bowles,
were bent over newspapers, and that annoyed him afresh. No need
to ask what they were reading. The girls were so absorbed that
their greeting was perfunctory; "Morning, Pop," they said without
looking up. He went on into his private office.</p>

<p>Presently Fanny came in bearing the newspaper. "Have you read
this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The headlines," he answered.</p>

<p>"This is the biggest case since Cain killed Abel!" said Fanny
solemnly. "Fancy, Jules Gartrey shot in his own house!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Mr. Mappin. "Husband comes home unexpectedly;
finds a younger man there; probably attacks him and gets shot for
his pains. It happens every day somewhere."</p>

<p>"Not to the Jules Gartreys of this world," said Fanny. "We've
got to get in this case, Pop."</p>

<p>"Get in it!" cried Mr. Mappin, now thoroughly exasperated.
"For heaven's sake, what is there in it for us?"</p>

<p>"Useless for you to talk that way," said Fanny coolly. "A man
as prominent as you simply can't be left out of a case as big as
this. You'll see."</p>

<p>"All the police have got to do is catch the killer."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not so simple as all that. There's a lot
that's unexplained. Sure, Al Yohe and Mrs. Gartrey have been
running around together, but that doesn't prove anything. You're
thinking in the terms of mellerdrammer, Pop. Modern people don't
act like that&mdash;not <i>that</i> lot, anyhow. There's
something back of it...Do you know Al Yohe?" she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Haven't that pleasure," said Lee stiffly. "I've seen him, of
course. Couldn't very well avoid it."</p>

<p>"He's not the type," said Fanny. "If he was caught by a
husband he would laugh."</p>

<p>"You seem to know him pretty well!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've met him at the Sourabaya; it's his job to greet
everybody who comes there. If you were to judge by what the
newspapers say, he is just a common sort of Casanova who goes
around rolling his eyes at women and trying to hypnotize them.
But that's not the truth, Pop. He's an American boy, full of
jokes, laughing all the time. It's true that women fall for him
right and left&mdash;Mrs. Gartrey is mad about him; I've seen
it&mdash;but that's because he tells them the truth about
themselves. No woman can resist it, Pop&mdash;not when the man is
so darned good-looking."</p>

<p>With that she left him. Lee was sufficiently impressed by her
earnestness to pick up the newspaper and read the Gartrey story
from beginning to end. It was meager as to fact and voluminous in
innuendo.</p>

<p>The Gartreys lived in a magnificent apartment on Fifth Avenue
overlooking the Park. Gartrey had had two wives before marrying
the present Mrs. Gartrey, one dead, one divorced, and this one
was thirty years younger than her husband. Alastair Yohe had
called at three o'clock on the previous afternoon and was still
there when the husband came home half an hour or so later. This
was earlier than his usual hour, the house elevator boy
testified. Gartrey had let himself in with a key instead of
ringing; consequently nobody was aware of his return until the
shot was heard. He was found lying in the entrance foyer, shot
through the temple. The butler, Robert Hawkins, found him.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the gun was lying on the floor near by. But the
absence of powder burns in the dead man's flesh precluded the
idea of suicide. There were no fingerprints on the gun. Mr.
Gartrey was still holding his latchkey between thumb and
forefinger, proving that he must have been shot down at the
moment of entering. There could be no question of the killer's
having acted in self-defense. Mr. Gartrey was not armed. The
elevator boy and the boys on duty in the hall of the apartment
house, all testified that, saving Alastair Yohe, no other person
had been taken to the Gartrey apartment previous to the
shooting.</p>

<p>The stories told by the inmates of the apartment were
contradictory. Mrs. Gartrey, upon the advice of her husband's
principal business associate, George Coler, talked fully to the
police. Both she and her maid Eliza Young asserted that Mr. Yohe
had taken his departure five minutes or more before the shot was
heard. The maid added that she had opened the front door for him
herself. Both women, of course, were anxious to divert any
suspicion of scandal and were obviously desirous of clearing the
young man. The maid's story was seriously damaged by the front
elevator boy, who swore that he had not taken Mr. Yohe down in
his car. Whereupon the maid pointed out that Yohe had several
other friends in the apartment house and might have gone to call
on one of them by the stairs. After the murder, so many people
came and went that the elevator boy could give no account of
them.</p>

<p>However, the maid's story was altogether destroyed by the
butler, Hawkins, who testified very reluctantly that immediately
after the shot was fired Mr. Yohe had come back into the rear
entry of the apartment and had left by the service door. He had
not said anything. He looked very disturbed. The other servants
were in their rooms and had not seen him. The boy on the service
elevator testified that he had not carried Yohe down, but there
was a service stairway. The maid Eliza intimated that the butler
had a grudge against Mr. Yohe and was lying. The most damning
fact, however, was that Yohe had run away. The police promised an
arrest within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Having digested the facts, Lee skimmed over the columns and
columns of fluff that were considered due the occasion. In the
minds of the newspaper writers, Yohe was already convicted of
murder. They played up the romance of his career for all there
was in it. The poor boy who had come to New York with nothing to
recommend him but a certain skill in camera portraiture, plus
remarkable good looks and charm of manner. It had been
sufficient. Within five years he found himself publicity agent,
official photographer and all-round hurrah boy at La Sourabaya,
the smartest and most popular night club of the time. Al Yohe had
made the place what it was. Not to be a friend of Al's was to
argue yourself unknown around town.</p>

<p>In this short space of time, Yohe had become one of the most
conspicuous social figures in New York. Men and women alike
courted him&mdash;millionaires, actresses, authors, even
scientists&mdash;not for himself but for the publicity that his
wicked camera commanded. Not only was he the lord of La Sourabaya
(the Oriental proprietors kept themselves discreetly in the
background); gifts were showered on him by the smartest shops in
town; he was never expected to pay for anything anywhere; he was
besieged with invitations to the best houses. In respect to his
amatory adventures, the writers had to be a little more careful.
They managed, however, to convey very clearly that Don Juan of
Sevila was a piker compared to Al Yohe of New York.</p>

<p>In order to build up Al, it was necessary to suggest that the
unfortunate Jules Gartrey was an unpleasant sort of man, hard and
unrelenting, unpopular alike in business and society. All the
lush adjectives in the reportorial vocabulary were used in
referring to Agnes Gartrey's beauty. The newspaper story actually
managed to suggest, without laying itself open to libel, that she
had had lovers before Al Yohe. The name of Rulon Innes, a
well-known glamour boy, was brought in.</p>

<p>Lee Mappin tossed the newspaper aside. "Vicious!" he muttered;
"this attempt to make a hero out of a common murderer!"</p>

<p>Fanny, who had been watching him through the open door out of
the tail of her eye, came in with the morning's mail. "Well, what
do you think of it, Pop?" she asked casually.</p>

<p>"I think no different from what I did before," he answered
sharply. "Certainly there's nothing in the newspaper that would
induce a sensible man to change his opinion."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Pop. Al Yohe is not the type."</p>

<p>"So you said before. How can you possibly know? Murderers
belong to no type. All kinds of people commit murder when the
provocation is strong enough."</p>

<p>"That's just it," said Fanny. "There is no reason in the world
why Al should have killed Mr. Gartrey."</p>

<p>"Please, Fanny," said Lee with heavy self-control, "don't let
me hear you falling into the vulgar habit of referring to a
criminal as if he were an intimate friend. Call him Yohe."</p>

<p>Fanny smiled with great sweetness. "All right, Pop,
dear...Look, somebody obviously was lying in wait for Mr.
Gartrey. That, at least would be impossible for a man like
Al...Yohe."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Lee, "and neither do you. Al..."</p>

<p>"Yohe," whispered Fanny wickedly.</p>

<p>"Al Yohe was how old? Twenty-five. Twenty-five is too soon for
a comely young face to reveal the real character of its wearer.
Only the old look wicked."</p>

<p>"There were no fingerprints on the gun," said Fanny. "Yet they
all say, that is, Mrs. Gartrey, Eliza Young, the elevator boy,
even the lying butler, that Al Yohe's hands were bare."</p>

<p>"He had gloves in his pocket," said Lee. "It takes no time at
all to pull on a loose glove and pull it off again." </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">DURING the following three days, the sensation
caused by the murder of Jules Gartrey rose to monstrous
proportions. Extra editions of the newspapers were issued every
half hour; nothing else could be talked about. Great crowds stood
dumbly in the street gazing up at the windows of the Gartrey
apartment and midtown Fifth Avenue was choked in front of the
Stieff Building where Al Yohe lived. They even stood all day long
packed front and rear at Police Headquarters, on the chance that
Yohe might be brought in. Disgraceful scenes attended the funeral
of Mr. Gartrey. To avoid the crowds, he was carried to his
country place in Westchester and buried from there. Word of it
got around, and thousands besieged the place. Finding the gates
locked, they swarmed over the fence and trampled down all the
shrubbery and flowers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gartrey remained in close seclusion, but was not,
however, averse to being interviewed. She had a case to put
before the world, and she presented it with skill, though nobody
believed a word of her story. She had frequently met Mr. Yohe in
society, she said, but he was not in any sense a close friend. It
was the first time he had come to her house except when there was
a party. She had sent for him to discuss the plans for a ball
that was to be held at the Waldorf-Astoria in December in aid of
Polish Relief. St. Bartholomew's Guild, of which she was
secretary, was getting up the affair. At a meeting of the Guild
it had been decided to ask Mr. Yohe to manage the ball because he
was such a good organizer. In sending for him to talk the matter
over, she was merely acting for the Guild. He was out of the
apartment a good five minutes before Mr. Gartrey came home. "My
husband," said Mrs. Gartrey, "like all successful men, had bitter
enemies. There were people who believed that they had lost money
through him." She could not, however, furnish the police with
names.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gartrey promptly discharged the butler, Robert Hawkins,
whose story did not agree with hers. Hawkins could have made a
small fortune by selling stories of the Gartrey household to the
newspapers, but he proved to be a man of very unusual decency; he
moved into a modest furnished room and declined to add a word to
his first statement. When the pestering of the reporters became
unbearable, he quietly left town without advertising his new
address.</p>

<p>The maid, Eliza Young, loyally supported her mistress' story.
She, of course, could let herself go more than the grand and
dignified Mrs. Gartrey. Eliza was always available for an
interview, and proved to be a passionate partisan of Alastair
Yohe's. This reacted against him. A plain woman, no longer young,
Eliza's lot in life had been singularly unexciting and, as was
natural, all this notoriety began to go to her head. She talked
too much. It was obvious to those who read her statements with
attention that she was better acquainted with Yohe than would
have been possible if he had made only one visit to the Gartrey
home.</p>

<p>On the third day, Alan Barry Deane, a rich young man about
town who lived on the second floor of the house where the
Gartreys had an apartment, came forward to say that shortly
before four o'clock on Monday (the afternoon of the murder),
Alastair Yohe had called on him with the object of persuading him
to serve on the floor committee of the Polish Relief Ball. He had
consented to serve on the committee. They had talked together for
a few minutes and had then gone out to discover the cause of the
excitement that was filling the house. Deane said he did not know
what became of Yohe after that, but insisted that up until then
Yohe had appeared quite his usual self. This story, which was
calculated to destroy that of the butler, was not, however,
generally believed. The public felt that Deane had delayed too
long before telling it, and that he was merely trying to
recommend himself to the beautiful Agnes Gartrey.</p>

<p>Various new pieces of evidence were brought out. Upon the news
of Gartrey's death, the securities of all the companies he was
interested in had broken sharply. There was a heavy short
interest which had taken the opportunity to cover at an enormous
profit. The police had not been able to trace this interest to
its source. It came out, moreover, that Gartrey's life had been
threatened mysteriously and that about a month before, he had
asked for police protection. About the same time he had taken out
a permit and purchased a gun. Apparently he believed the
threatened danger had passed, for at the time of his murder the
gun was lying in a drawer of his bureau. The police at the same
time were endeavoring to trace ownership of the gun found on the
scene from which one shot had been fired. When they established
that this gun had been sold to Alastair Yohe during the previous
year, it was admitted that the case against Yohe was
complete.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that much-wanted young man succeeded in keeping out
of the hands of the police. Though he had thousands of "friends,"
though he was the most be-photographed young man in the country,
and his smiling, handsome face must have been familiar to every
reader of newspapers from the Atlantic to the Pacific, he was not
found. Trainmen, bus conductors, airplane stewardesses, ticket
agents everywhere were looking for him. There were innumerable
clues which came to nothing. Arrests were made by the local
police of Philadelphia, Hanover, New Hampshire, Milledgeville,
Georgia, and as far away as Fargo, North Dakota, and New York
detectives sent out to bring him in, only to find themselves
fooled. A bitter note crept into the communiques issued from
Headquarters. It was obvious that somebody must be concealing the
wanted man. Each day the police promised results within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>It turned out that Yohe had proceeded directly from the scene
of the murder to his own small bachelor apartment in the Stieff
Building near the Plaza. The elevator man testified that he had
looked "very upset." After a few minutes he had gone out again
with a different suit on and was swallowed up by the unknown. He
kept no personal servant. A maid employed by the management of
the building said significantly that Mr. Yohe seldom slept at
home. The public loved it. Upon searching his rooms the police
had found nothing that pertained to the case. He was a discreet
young man; he left no scrap of writing from any of the many women
with whom his name had been connected. There were thousands of
photographs of the great, the near-great and the would-be-great,
some of which had a great potential value. They were so
unflattering that the subjects might have been willing to pay
anything to keep them out of print. But it was never charged that
Yohe had taken money for such a purpose. A few of the photographs
found their way into the newspapers, affording the town a series
of laughs. The Commissioner of Police then cracked down on the
press and impounded the lot.</p>

<p>These three days were full of little irritations for Lee
Mappin. He was not allowed to forget the vulgar affair for long
and his work suffered. Even the discreet, the correct Jermyn
permitted himself to suggest that his master ought to take a hand
in the case. At the office little Fanny Parran, usually so
sensible, displayed a prejudice on behalf of the handsome young
murderer as passionate and unreasonable as that of Eliza Young in
the press. When the police finally identified the murder gun as
Yohe's, Lee fetched a sigh of relief. Now, please God, they'll
leave me alone! he thought.</p>

<p>When he got to the office there was no sign of grief or
disappointment in Fanny's pretty face, no change of any sort.
When she brought in the mail she said with a beguiling
air&mdash;Lee had never seen her looking sweeter:</p>

<p>"Pop, why don't you talk to Inspector Loasby about the Gartrey
case?"</p>

<p>"What is there to talk about?" said Lee, keeping a careful
hold on his rising temper. "I am not a bloodhound. It is no part
of my job to track down fugitives from justice."</p>

<p>"Of course not, Pop. That's not what I had in mind. Everybody
in the world believes that Al Yohe is guilty. In the interests of
justice you ought to examine the evidence that the police have
against him and point out the flaws in it."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, have you the face to pretend you still believe
that man to be innocent?"</p>

<p>"I'm not your dear girl when you talk to me like a stuffy
schoolmaster," said Fanny with spirit. "And I am not
pretending."</p>

<p>"After the police have established that Gartrey was shot with
Yohe's gun!"</p>

<p>"How can you be so wrongheaded ?" cried Fanny. "That is the
best proof of Al's innocence that has come out! Can you conceive
of a man so stupid as to leave his gun at the scene of the
killing? That gun was planted there!"</p>

<p>"Maybe so," cried Lee waving his hands. "It's no business of
mine. I'm sick of hearing the fellow's name! If he's innocent why
does he choose to live like a hunted creature? Let him come back
like a man and face the music, and if he needs help I'll help
him!"</p>

<p>"Now, Pop," said Fanny soothingly, "honestly, after taking
everything into consideration, would you come back if you were in
his place?"</p>

<p>Lee disdained to answer.</p>

<p>"If he came back there would be a hundred thousand yelling
people around Police Headquarters. And what would the authorities
do? Rush him to trial in order to quiet the mob; obtain a snap
verdict&mdash;no jury would dare go against the mob&mdash;and
rush him to execution. Would that be justice?"</p>

<p>"I cannot fight for a man in hiding," said Lee. Fanny gave him
a level look. "Well, I'm disappointed in you," she said, marching
out.</p>

<p>Lee was left to nurse an unreasonable feeling of soreness and
frustration. Fanny was not to be drawn into any further
discussion and he was forced to argue it out with himself. Very
unsatisfactory. He was satisfied that his attitude was the
correct one, but how could you convince a woman when she wouldn't
listen?</p>

<p>He spent a part of the afternoon in dictating to Judy. She was
of an entirely different character from Fanny, more serene and
placid, not so liable to fly off the handle, in a word more
feminine, Lee told himself. Judy was of the tall and statuesque
type with big brown eyes and hair like a raven's wing. Lee's eyes
dwelt with pleasure on her graceful, bent head.</p>

<p>"You are very beautiful," he said.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Pop," she said calmly. She had heard it so often
before. And went on all in the same breath: "Pop, why are you so
prejudiced against poor Al Yohe?"</p>

<p>It was like a dash of cold water on Lee. "You too!" he said in
the same tone that Caesar must have used to Brutus.</p>

<p>"Well, you are not usually so influenced by the newspapers,"
Judy went on. "How often have you told us that we should think
for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Fanny's been getting at you!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"Of course we've talked the case over," said Judy; "how could
we avoid it? But I don't take all my ideas from Fanny. I have a
mind of my own, I hope."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me what sources of information you
possess besides the newspapers?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>His sarcasm never touched her. "None," she said in her calm
and gentle manner. "I read the newspapers and form my own
conclusions."</p>

<p>"And what are they, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Why can't you talk about it reasonably, Pop? Why do you get
sore whenever Al's name is mentioned? According to your own rule,
that proves your case is weak."</p>

<p>It did not make Lee feel any less sore to have his own words
turned against him.</p>

<p>Judy went on in her calm way: "It all sounds too cut and
dried, Pop. Something important is omitted. They say that Mr.
Gartrey came home unexpectedly and surprised them. They also say
that the shot was not fired in the heat of passion but that Al
was laying for him. They can't have it both ways, Pop. If he came
home before he was expected, how could Al have been laying for
him at the door?"</p>

<p>Lee looked at her in surprise. "That's rather neatly argued,"
he said.</p>

<p>Judy blushed with pleasure. "You think I'm beautiful but
dumb," she said.</p>

<p>"That's not so," insisted Lee, "or I couldn't afford to keep
you here."</p>

<p>Judy made haste to follow up her advantage. "That woman is
certainly lying, Pop!"</p>

<p>"Why, she's Al's only friend!" In spite of himself Lee was
falling into the habit of referring thus familiarly to the
celebrity.</p>

<p>"If she's really his friend she's a fool," said Judy. "She's
not going the right way about it to clear him. I often have to
lie myself and I can tell when another woman is lying."</p>

<p>"What is your idea of what really happened, my dear?" asked
Lee quite mildly.</p>

<p>Judy spread out her hands. "Ah, I haven't any," she said.
"That's where we must depend on you, Pop. If you delved into the
case you would find out the truth about it."</p>

<p>Lee said judicially: "In the apartment at the time of the
shooting were Mrs. Gartrey and Al Yohe; Hawkins, the butler;
Eliza Young, the lady's maid, and four other maids. There is a
second manservant but he was out on an errand. How could it have
been any of these excepting Yohe? How could I even start an
investigation without having an opportunity to hear Yohe's own
story?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Judy rising. "It hadn't occurred to me." She
went out thoughtfully. A moment later he saw her in deep
confabulation with Fanny.</p>

<p>A man from the <i>World-Telegram</i> came in to see him. He
was followed by a Daily News reporter and a whole group of
others, including redheaded Tom Cot-tar from the <i>Herald
Tribune</i>. Tom had been sweet on Fanny Parran for a long time.
Lee noted that her greeting today was somewhat cool. Tom was a
prime favorite with Lee, and the others, knowing it, let Tom do
the talking.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, we want an opinion from you on the Gartrey
case."</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," warned Lee, "you know that I have made it a rule
not to discuss a crime before it comes to trial."</p>

<p>"You don't need to express an opinion as to Al Yohe's guilt,"
said Tom. "That's established. Just discuss the case generally.
Tell us what it suggests to you from a social point of view, or
any such tripe."</p>

<p>"Tripe?" said Lee, running up his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," said Tom, grinning. "This case has
reached such proportions that the public is demanding an
expression of views from their favorite criminologist."</p>

<p>"Poppycock!" said Lee. "The truth is, the public is ravenous
for news about the case; you haven't any for them today and so
you come to me for a filler."</p>

<p>"Well, you have never let us down yet," said Tom
cajolingly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to now. I have nothing to say."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Mappin..."</p>

<p>"By Gad! if I'm pestered any further about this damned case
I'll leave town!" cried Lee.</p>

<p>"Pestered?" asked the <i>Daily News</i> man, scenting a story.
"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By all of you! Not another word!"</p>

<p>When they saw that he meant it, they filed out. Lee detained
Tom. "I want to speak to you about a personal matter."</p>

<p>Tom looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Who tipped you off to come to me today?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Tom shrugged innocently&mdash;too innocently. "The assignment
came to me in the usual way."</p>

<p>"Tom, there appears to be a kind of conspiracy afoot with the
object of forcing me into this case. You and I must make a stand
against it."</p>

<p>Tom, after glancing uneasily over his shoulder, mutely put out
a hand.</p>

<p>Lee grasped it. "What's behind it, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'm with you, Pop," mumbled Tom, "but I can't say anything
when she's just outside the door."</p>

<p>Lee glanced at his watch. "I'll be leaving here in half an
hour. Meet me in the Vanderbilt bar at five-ten."</p>

<p>"Okay, Pop."</p>

<p>Sitting at a little table in the Vanderbilt bar with Scotch
and soda before them, Lee and Tom compared notes. Said Tom:</p>

<p>"This guy is as guilty as hell, Lee. That was nothing in my
life until Fanny felt that she had received a call to save him.
Since then I have had no peace. She is threatening to ship me
because I can't change the policy of the <i>Herald Tribune</i>
toward the case. Damn him anyhow! By God! how I would like to
flatten his Grecian nose with my fist! All handsome men are
so-and-sos!" Tom had no pretensions to good looks, though there was
a pleasing masculinity about his strongly marked features.</p>

<p>"I sympathize with you," said Lee. "What started Fanny off at
this tangent?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me. She is mysterious."</p>

<p>"Is it possible she could have seen Al Yohe since the
murder?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Before this happened, had you any reason to suppose that
Fanny had fallen in love with him?"</p>

<p>"She's not in love with him," said Tom coolly. "I would know
how to deal with that. This is worse, Pop. God help a man when
his girl embarks on a moral crusade! He is helpless!"</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to stand out against this foolishness until
it blows over," said Lee firmly. "To give in to it would only be
to make ourselves ridiculous!" They shook hands on it again. </p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">LEE was engaged to dine this night with the Curt
Wintergrenns. He had been looking forward to the occasion because
Carol Wintergrenn had snapped up a French refugee chef who was a
master of his profession. This was his first performance and he
would certainly be on his mettle. Lee loved masterly cooking.
However, when he reflected that the table talk would inevitably
concentrate on the Gartrey case, his heart sank. He called up
Mrs. Wintergrenn to beg off.</p>

<p>She wouldn't hear of it. "Lee!" she screamed. "At the eleventh
hour! The dinner of the season! I am depending on you to hold it
together; to give the affair a cachet! How could I replace you
now? My party will be ruined. I don't believe you've got a
headache. Tell me the real reason you want to stay away."</p>

<p>Answered Lee: "You're entitled to the truth, my darling. I am
so fed up with this nasty Gartrey affair that it nauseates me. I
know, people being what they are, nothing else will be talked
about tonight, and I can't face it."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she said in a voice of relief. "Well, I haven't
been giving dinners for ten years for nothing. You sit beside me
and I shall keep the conversation in my own hands. I promise you
you shan't be annoyed."</p>

<p>So Lee agreed to be there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Carol Wintergrenn's promise, there were two
men at her table whose names had been connected with the Gartrey
case, George Coler and Rulon Innes, and she found herself
helpless. She would no sooner get the talk steered away from the
all-absorbing topic than somebody would ask Coler or Innes a
question. The whole table would wait in silence for the answer,
and off they would go again. However, Lee did not mind it as much
as he had expected; the limelight was beating on the two men in
the know, and little Lee was allowed to savor the marvelous
<i>salmi de caneton</i> in peace.</p>

<p>Coler, who was Gartrey's principal lieutenant in business, was
a handsome bachelor in the middle forties with a reputation for
wit and <i>savoir-faire</i> that caused him to be much in demand
for dinners. Lee had never cared for him, simply because he had
himself under such perfect control. Lee himself was not
accustomed to wearing his heart on his sleeve, and he freely
granted the necessity of keeping a guard on yourself in the great
world, but such people did not interest him; for him in woman or
man it was the native wood-note wild that charmed.</p>

<p>A woman asked: "Mr. Coler, honestly, how is dear Agnes bearing
up under the strain?" The affected solicitude did not conceal the
purr of satisfaction in her voice. Older and plainer women
naturally were delighted to see Agnes Gartrey catching it.</p>

<p>"Magnificently!" said Coler smoothly. "Like all your sex, when
faced by something really big, she has risen out of herself."</p>

<p>"Is she in love with Al Yohe?"</p>

<p>"Honestly," said Coler, spreading out his hands, "I don't
know. I am the watchdog of her business affairs, not her
heart."</p>

<p>"Of course she is!" cried another woman. "Look how she stands
up for him!"</p>

<p>"That proves nothing. She has to stand up for him in order to
clear her own skirts."</p>

<p>"Strange as it may seem, I think she was attached to her
hard-boiled old husband," said Coler. "At least, they got along
pretty well together, considering."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed all the women together.</p>

<p>"A man thirty years older!"</p>

<p>"If she is in love with Yohe," Coler went on, "so much the
worse for her. Even in the unlikely event of his clearing
himself, they could never come together now."</p>

<p>Young Rulon Innes, feeling that he had been left out of the
conversation long enough, now delivered his opinion
authoritatively: "None of you are being fair to Agnes. Nobody
understands her. She has the heart of a child!"</p>

<p>Hearing this, the women kept their lips decorous, but their
eyes were frankly derisive. Lee, glancing around the table,
enjoyed the comedy. Innes was a handsome young man in a somewhat
luscious style. He was so filled with the consciousness of his
beauty that he appeared to be about to choke on it. Lee wondered
how a woman could fall for him, yet many had; perhaps it was
because he, after Al Yohe, was the fashion.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> she in love with Al Yohe?" persisted the first
woman.</p>

<p>"Nothing to it," said Innes languidly, regarding his finger
nails. "Al's methods with women were those of a truck driver. No
finesse." He paused to point the contrast between Al and himself.
Some of the women bit their lips. "Agnes would never fall for
that sort of thing," he went on. "She is too fastidious...Does it
not occur to any of you that she may be telling the simple
truth?"</p>

<p>Carol Wintergrenn was provoked. "The truth is never simple,"
she said, "and nobody nowadays ever tells it...For heaven's sake,
let us talk about something else."</p>

<p>They paid no attention to her. Everybody at the table had a
contribution to make to the Gartrey case and sat bouncing in
impatience to get a word in. There was Miss Delphine Harley, the
actress, perennially lovely and smiling. She said:</p>

<p>"I must take exception to truck driver. Poor Al's manners were
free but never coarse. He despised the sultry innuendo that
passes for love-making in the night clubs. Al never 'made love.'
He captivated women by making them laugh. His apparent
sexlessness was a challenge to us. His naturalness, his honesty
were as refreshing as a breeze off the sea."</p>

<p>This produced a little babel of assent and dissent around the
table. Miss Harley popped a forkful of the salmi into her mouth
and murmured: "Delicious!" Rulon Innes laughed a thought too
loudly and was heard to say:</p>

<p>"Al Yohe sexless! That's good!"</p>

<p>"Women will know what I mean," said Delphine quietly. "Don't
think that I am belittling sex," she went on with her delightful,
wicked smile. "Sex is grand! But I must say we women get a little
tired of seeing it paraded like a drum major."</p>

<p>There were murmurs of assent from other women. "Perhaps," said
Delphine, delicately balancing her fork, "perhaps Al Yohe's
pretense of sexlessness was the finest kind of finesse."</p>

<p>Lee went through the motions of clapping his hands. He loved
wit in a woman. Delphine Harley was doing something that Fanny
and Judy had not been able to accomplish, forcing him a little to
reconsider his ideas about the legendary Al.</p>

<p>There was a Senator at the table, who protested throatily:
"But, my dear Miss Harley, a murderer!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's something else again," said Delphine with a
shrug.</p>

<p>"Surely you can't have any doubt as to his guilt?"</p>

<p>"I have no opinion at all," said Delphine sweetly. "I leave
that to my betters."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what <i>I</i> think," put in the woman
who had started the discussion. "It has not been suggested in the
newspapers, but I believe that Agnes Gartrey herself is keeping
him under cover."</p>

<p>This was received around the table with the silence of
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he ever left the apartment!" she added
triumphantly.</p>

<p>This opened up fascinating possibilities to her hearers.</p>

<p>"Oh, I assure you you are wrong," said George Coler earnestly.
"Mrs. Gartrey has discussed the case with me in all its
implications. I can state positively that if she knew where he
was, she would be the first to produce him."</p>

<p>After the ladies had left the table and the gentlemen were
occupied with their cigars and liqueurs, a footman approached Lee
Mappin.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Mappin, you're wanted on the telephone,
sir."</p>

<p>Lee left the table in some surprise. He could think of no
reason why anyone should call him there. The servant led him to a
telephone booth at the back of the hall. It was a woman's voice
that came over the wire, a voice unknown to Lee.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, please forgive me for disturbing you."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"Agnes Gartrey."</p>

<p>Lee felt like a big round O of astonishment. He had never met
Mrs. Gartrey, but the quality of the voice, its agitation,
assured him that this was certainly she.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Gartrey?"</p>

<p>The voice became imploring. "Would you come to see me
tonight?"</p>

<p>"But I'm dining out, Mrs. Gartrey."</p>

<p>"I know. It doesn't matter how late you are."</p>

<p>"But what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Just give me a little advice. Everything I do or say seems to
be the wrong thing!"</p>

<p>Curiosity is a powerful motive force. "Very well, Mrs.
Gartrey, I will be there as soon as I can get away."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you so much! Please don't say anything about your
visit to me."</p>

<p>"I shall not do so."</p>

<p>When he returned to the dining room Curt Wintergrenn said: "No
bad news, I hope, Lee."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Curt. A bit of routine business, that's all."</p>

<p>"You looked a little disturbed."</p>

<p>Lee laid a hand on his epigastrium. "I partook a little too
generously of the <i>caneton</i>."</p>

<p>"Have a brandy?"</p>

<p>When they returned to the drawing room Mrs. Wintergrenn was
sitting alone at the coffee table and Lee went to her. "Carol, I
have had a phone call, I shall have to slip away, my dear."</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully. "Don't you like my
party?...Honestly, Lee, I'm distressed because I couldn't steer
the talk better."</p>

<p>"You needn't apologize for that," he said. "I'm positively
becoming interested in the case."</p>

<p>"Do me a little favor before you go," begged Carol. "Anything
within my power, my dear."</p>

<p>"While you men were at the table we got to talking about
crime. Somebody said that criminals had a snap nowadays because
of modern inventions. For instance, a call made from a dial phone
cannot be traced. I said that might be, but that you were able to
read off a phone number just from hearing it dialed. They all
scouted at the idea. Please, Lee, give them a demonstration."</p>

<p>"I hate to do parlor tricks," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I know, but just to bear me out, <i>please</i>. Afterwards
you can slip out quietly, and I'll make your excuses."</p>

<p>Lee submitted and the whole party adjourned to the hall to
make the test. One went into the booth while Lee, provided with
pencil and pad, turned his back on it. As the numbers were
dialed, Lee made marks on his pad. Out of five tries he read off
four correctly, and great was the wonder of the beholders.</p>

<p>"There is no magic in it," said Lee; "simply a question of
training your ear. Some people pull the dial around quickly, some
slowly; you pay no attention to that sound. But the dial always
comes clicking back at the same measured rate of speed; that is
what you listen for. I can do it without pencil and paper, but
there is a danger of forgetting a number before the call is
completed. So I make these marks of different lengths
corresponding to the passage of the dial, and then I have a
record."</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" they cried.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he made an inconspicuous get-away.</p>

<p><br> The Gartrey apartment occupied the entire eighth floor of
one of the finest buildings on the avenue. A manservant admitted
Lee to a stately foyer. An immense music room opened off on his
left and in front of him a salon as big as a museum. Today the
very rich have more space in their city apartments than they once
had in a whole house. Mrs. Gartrey presently came swimming to
meet him in something pink that set off her cunningly dressed
chestnut hair. She looked like a girl and was, perhaps, thirty
years old. She was beautiful but not so beautiful in the flesh as
in her photographs. It was because hers was a beauty of feature
rather than expression. The touch of gentleness that makes a
woman wholly adorable was lacking. It was clear that she had
suffered dreadfully during the past few days, but it had not
softened her.</p>

<p>"How good of you!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"I was glad to come if you think I can be of the least use,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>She led him to a settee by the fireplace. She was alone in the
vast room. Lee reflected that rich people were apt to be lonelier
than the poor. They sat down.</p>

<p>"Will you have a drink, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, no. I have just come from a too-hospitable
house."</p>

<p>A bitter expression crossed her face. "I expect I was well
discussed around the table."</p>

<p>He wasn't going to lie to her. "You were," he said
candidly.</p>

<p>"What did they say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Mrs. Gartrey, you didn't ask me here to repeat
silly gossip. I assure you you did not lack defenders at the
table."</p>

<p>She put a handkerchief to her lips. "It's so hard to know
where to begin my story!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you chose to send for me instead of somebody
else."</p>

<p>"That's easy," she said. "One reads your books; one reads in
the newspaper how extraordinarily clever you are in bringing the
truth to light in baffling cases. I want you to find out the
truth of this case."</p>

<p>Lee waited for more. It was obvious that the woman was
suffering intensely, but did she really want the truth? He
doubted it.</p>

<p>"You understand," she went on, "I am asking you to accept me
for a client. I expect to pay for your services."</p>

<p>Lee waved his hand. That didn't commit him to anything.</p>

<p>Her voice scaled up. "The newspapers are like a pack of dogs,
like a pack of dogs yapping at Mr. Yohe's heels!" she cried. "He
is innocent of any wrongdoing. He was out of the house before my
husband came home. I want you to prove that to the world."</p>

<p>"How can I without his co-operation?" said Lee.</p>

<p>She put a hand over her eyes. "Oh, I know! I know! It was
suicidal for him to run away and to stay away. I wish to God I
could reach him. I could soon persuade him to come back."</p>

<p>Lee said, to see what kind of reaction he would get: "It has
been suggested that you do know where he is."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," she said scornfully. "Would I be suffering
this horrible uncertainty? Would I stay here if I knew? This
place has become a nightmare to me. Every time I cross the foyer
I can see my husband lying there."</p>

<p>"Why do you stay here?"</p>

<p>"Because I think that Al...Mr. Yohe may try to get in touch
with me here. By telephone. Even the telephone is risky, but he
might take a chance. I am listening for it day and night!"</p>

<p>Lee thought: Okay, she does not know where he is.</p>

<p>He said: "Until he does come back, Mrs. Gartrey, I don't see
what I can do."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must, you must help me!" she cried, clasping her
hands. "Ask me whatever you like and I'll gladly pay it!"</p>

<p>"Believe me, it's not a question of a fee," he said mildly. "I
have sufficient for my modest wants. I have no family."</p>

<p>"All you have to do is to come out in his favor," she pleaded.
"Then, wherever he is, he would see that he had a friend and a
powerful one; that would bring him back."</p>

<p>Lee said firmly: "I can't come out in his favor until I see
some reason to doubt his guilt."</p>

<p>"He's innocent!" she wailed. "Who should know that better than
I?"</p>

<p>"If Alastair Yohe didn't shoot your husband, who did?" asked
Lee bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to accuse anybody else! I have no
proof!"</p>

<p>"If you have even a suspicion it will be safe with me."</p>

<p>"Have you thought of the butler, Robert Hawkins?" she asked in
a muffled voice.</p>

<p>"Hm, that's a new lead," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He was in a position to do it," she went on eagerly, "and it
would explain why he tried to put it off on Al."</p>

<p>"What motive could Hawkins have had?"</p>

<p>"Personal motive? None! He was only a servant. But my husband
had enemies. Men of great wealth. It would have been easy for one
of them to get at Hawkins and to pay him, to pay him a great sum,
perhaps, to do away with my husband."</p>

<p>"That's a possibility," said Lee. "I will investigate it."</p>

<p>"I understand that Hawkins has disappeared," she said.</p>

<p>"Only from the newspaper reporters. He has given the police
his present address."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a smooth customer," she said bitterly. "Don't be
deceived by his snowy hair and his seeming honesty!"</p>

<p>"I am not easily deceived," said Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"He washes his hair with bluing to make it whiter," she said
acidly. "My maid told me. It wouldn't do any good for you to talk
to him. He would only lie."</p>

<p>"Naturally. I shall endeavor to find out if he has come into
any money lately."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gartrey arose. "You must let me give you a check, Mr.
Mappin. You shall name the amount yourself!"</p>

<p>Lee held up his hand. "Thank you, no! I have not yet taken the
case."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gartrey's eyes never left his face. As they proceeded
toward the door, she saw him looking at the masses of expensive
flowers that filled the room, and murmured: "People <i>will</i>
send flowers. And usually the people one doesn't much care for.
It is so inconsiderate. Every box that comes administers a fresh
stab!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you send them to a hospital?" he asked dryly.</p>

<p>"The senders usually call to extend their condolences. They
would be offended if they didn't see their flowers."</p>

<p>Lee passed a huge bouquet of American Beauty roses with stems
three feet long. Under the edge of the vase which contained them
was caught the edge of a card&mdash;presumably the sender's. On
it was written: "Deepest sympathy&mdash;Rulon."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey," said Lee, "why don't you address Mr. Yohe
through the newspapers? Wherever he is, we may be sure that he
reads them."</p>

<p>"How can I?" she murmured distressfully. "In the first shock
of this awful happening I was so confused, so distracted, that I
made the mistake of telling the police that he was just a casual
acquaintance. You know better than that. I can't hide anything
from you. But I trust you. You see, if the truth about what I
feel came out now, it would only react against him."</p>

<p>There was something very flattering, very affecting in the
sight of the famous beauty casting herself on his mercy like
this. And she knows it! thought Lee. "I see," he said.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Mappin, I swear to you there has been no wrongdoing!"
she protested.</p>

<p>"I accept it," said Lee. He took a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>"I may say, though, that it wouldn't make the slightest
difference to me if there had been."</p>

<p>She laid her hand lightly for a moment on his arm. "Ah, you
are so kind and understanding!"</p>

<p>"Still," he said, "why can't you put an ad among the public
notices that none but he would understand. Haven't you some
private way of addressing him that he would recognize?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with an appearance of great sadness. "No!
It hadn't gone as far as that, you understand." </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">LEE MAPPIN had now reached the point where he
read with care every word in the newspapers appertaining to the
Gartrey case. His face turned a little grim next morning when he
came upon this item in the <i>Herald Tribune</i>:</p>

<blockquote> Amos Lee Mappin, the well-known author and
criminologist, is known to have called on Mrs. Jules Gartrey at
her apartment late last night. What took place during this
interview can only be surmised, but it looks as if Mr. Mappin was
preparing to enter the case on behalf of the missing Alastair
Yohe. </blockquote>

<p>Tipped off the paper herself, thought Lee.</p>

<p>When he reached the office he was a little disturbed to see
the glint of a fresh determination in Fanny Parran's blue eye.
She did not keep him long in doubt as to what it portended.
Bringing in the mail, she said:</p>

<p>"Pop, I've been thinking all night about something you said to
Judy yesterday."</p>

<p>"What was that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"You said you couldn't make any move to help Al Yohe unless
you could hear his story."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Lee, wondering what on earth was coming
next.</p>

<p>"Would you consent to see Al Yohe and let him tell you his
story?"</p>

<p>Lee almost bounced out of his chair. "Good God! Fanny, do you
realize what you're saying?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Do you know where he is?"</p>

<p>"No," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"What am I to understand from this extraordinary proposition
of yours?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said cautiously, "I've been approached by somebody
who knows Al and presumably is able to communicate with him."</p>

<p>"Was it Mrs. Gartrey?" demanded Lee.</p>

<p>Fanny turned pink with anger. "No indeed! I believe that woman
is playing a double part and Judy thinks so, too."</p>

<p>"Then who was it?"</p>

<p>Fanny's soft lips hardened. "I won't tell you that, Pop. It's
useless for you to ask me."</p>

<p>"My dear girl," said Lee, holding himself in, "don't you
understand that for you to have any truck with a fugitive from
justice without informing the police, constitutes you an
accessory to his crime?"</p>

<p>Fanny was unimpressed. "Surely, I know it. It's one of those
things men make such a fuss about that you might think it was
important."</p>

<p>"And what is more important?"</p>

<p>"Many things. Justice, honor, good faith&mdash;" Fanny touched
her breast, "and that something in here which prompts you how to
act in a specific case whatever the usual rules may be."</p>

<p>"I am being instructed," said Lee dryly.</p>

<p>"I am only applying what you have taught me," said Fanny
firmly.</p>

<p>Though he preserved an appearance of calmness, Lee was growing
a little warm. "Those are brave words," he said, "but the plain
truth of the matter is that you have become infatuated with
this..."</p>

<p>Fanny turned pink again. "That's not so, Pop. It's not desire
for the man that has got me going, but a desire to see justice
done. Why this woman who came to me..."</p>

<p>"So it was a woman!"</p>

<p>"She is much closer to Al Yohe than I could ever be&mdash;or
wish to be. Would I be trying to help her if I wanted him
myself?"</p>

<p>Lee shifted ground a little. "Am I to understand that this
request for an interview comes from the woman or from Al
himself?"</p>

<p>"From AL He wants nothing in the world so much as a chance to
tell you his story."</p>

<p>"Do you know his story?"</p>

<p>"I do not, and neither does the person who came to me. Al will
not tell it to anybody but yourself."</p>

<p>"Can't he write it?"</p>

<p>"He dare not trust it to paper."</p>

<p>"But if he told me his story I would have to carry it direct
to the police."</p>

<p>"Al does not believe that you would do that after hearing his
story, that is, not until you had conducted an investigation of
your own. There are certain facts that have to be established.
The truth is well hidden and he feels that only you can dig it
up. It would be fatal to put it in the hands of the police."</p>

<p>Lee had recovered his good humor. "This is horribly tempting,"
he said. "My curiosity is at fever heat, but I must stick to the
line I have adopted. Unless I play along with the police I might
as well go out of business altogether."</p>

<p>"Then I am to send word that you refuse to see Al Yohe?"</p>

<p>"Unless there is a policeman present," said Lee, smiling.</p>

<p>"No good," said Fanny glumly. "He won't give himself up."</p>

<p>"And what's more," said Lee, "for your own sake I must urge
you to play along with me. This is a dangerous business you're
embarking in, my dear. Let the young fellow be arrested and you
may rest assured that I will leave no stone unturned to discover
the truth."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That's your notion of the right thing to
do; you must let me have mine. I couldn't betray the girl who
trusts me. You can fire me if you like."</p>

<p>Lee was startled. "Bless your heart, I'm not going to fire
you! But you mustn't tempt me any further. If I did right I would
report this conversation to Inspector Loasby, but I'm going to
stretch my conscience that far."</p>

<p>Fanny went out with her chin up.</p>

<p>Presently Lee taxied down to Headquarters. The moment Loasby
caught sight of him he said bitterly:</p>

<p>"I see you've started your own investigation of the Gartrey
case!" The handsome Inspector, owing to his failure to arrest Al
Yohe, had been the target of biting criticism in the press. He
was inordinately sensitive to criticism.</p>

<p>"To a certain extent," said Lee composedly, "but <i>not</i> at
the behest of the lovely widow."</p>

<p>"What did she say to you?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to retain me in her interest at a big fee..."</p>

<p>"Some men have all the luck!"</p>

<p>"I declined the fee...The only thing she said that interested
me was to suggest that Robert Hawkins was the murderer."</p>

<p>"Don't believe it! Hawkins is the only square shooter in the
whole crooked bunch. What motive could he have had?"</p>

<p>"She suggested that some powerful enemy of Gartrey's had hired
the butler to do away with his master."</p>

<p>Loasby considered this. "Well, it's worth looking into. It
puts a new angle on the case."</p>

<p>"Keep it under your hat for the present," said Lee. "Will you
let me talk to Hawkins before you take any action?"</p>

<p>Loasby glanced at him with suspicion in his eye.</p>

<p>"I have no interest in this matter except to satisfy my own
curiosity," said Lee blandly; "and if I work with anybody it will
only be with you...It won't be the first time."</p>

<p>The Inspector's face cleared. "Sure that's right, Mr. Mappin."
Picking up a phone from his desk, he asked a subordinate for the
address of Robert Hawkins, and when it came, repeated it to Lee.
"147A Orthodox Street, Frankford, Philadelphia. Is known there
under his right name. The landlady is Mrs. Quimby."</p>

<p>Lee made a note of it. "I'll run over to Philadelphia and
report to you on my return."</p>

<p>Loasby said: "Hawkins doesn't know it, but I'm keeping him
under surveillance, just in case anybody should try to bribe him
to make a real disappearance. The story he tells is very
unpleasing to Al Yohe's friends."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Lee.</p>

<p><br> At the address on Orthodox Street some two hours later,
Lee found an old-fashioned rooming house. The door was opened to
him by a decent body who looked as if she might belong to the
Quaker meeting house across the road.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Hawkins home?"</p>

<p>"I'll see, sir."</p>

<p>"I won't trouble you to climb the stairs," said Lee. "Just
tell me which is his room and I'll go up." There was nothing
about Lee's natty little person to arouse a landlady's
suspicions. "Two flights up, sir. Front hall room."</p>

<p>Lee knocked on the door and an agreeable voice bade him come
in. The narrow room was shabby, comfortable and clean. The
tenant, an elderly man, clean-shaven, was sitting by the window,
reading. From old habit, Lee glanced first at the title of his
book: <i>The Life of Andrew Jackson</i>. Hawkins hastily put the
book down and rose, removing his glasses. He was tall and well
made; his expression mild and benignant.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir. I thought it was the
maidservant."</p>

<p>English, obviously, an old family servant whose beautiful
manners had no trace of obsequiousness. This is very flattering
to the masters. Lee could not help but feel drawn to Hawkins. He
reminded himself that the perfect butler is the product of art,
not of nature. After forty years of butlering, it would be
impossible for an observer to tell what was really passing
through a butler's mind.</p>

<p>"Do you know me?" asked Lee. "If you do, it will save
explanations."</p>

<p>"Your face is familiar, sir, but I can't quite place it."</p>

<p>"Amos Lee Mappin."</p>

<p>The old man's eyes widened in surprise. "Mr. Map-pin! Indeed,
sir, I know you well by reputation."</p>

<p>"Then you know I'm not a mere curiosity seeker. The New York
police furnished me with your address. I want to talk to you
about the Gartrey case."</p>

<p>"Please to be seated, Mr. Mappin." He insisted on Lee's taking
the comfortable chair by the window; himself remained
standing.</p>

<p>"Sit down," urged Lee. "You are not in service now."</p>

<p>Hawkins sat in a plain chair beside the washstand.</p>

<p>"I will assume," said Lee, "that your story as reported in the
newspapers was substantially correct. You need not repeat it but
just answer my questions. At three o'clock last Monday afternoon
Mr. Yohe came to see Mrs. Gartrey and you let him in."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I couldn't swear to the exact hour."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Was he expected?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mrs. Gartrey had told me to bring him direct to her
bou...her sitting room."</p>

<p>Lee did not miss the slip. "Her boudoir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That is what we called the room. But I have noticed
in the United States that boudoir is taken to mean a bedroom, and
I do not wish to convey a misapprehension. It was Mrs. Gartrey's
private sitting room where she received her friends."</p>

<p>Lee smiled at the old man's conscientiousness. "I do not
misapprehend you, Hawkins. Had he visited her before?"</p>

<p>Hawkins looked distressed. "Yes, sir, I am obliged to tell the
truth. Many times, sir."</p>

<p>"Were they lovers?"</p>

<p>The old butler was shocked. "How should I know, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, what is your opinion? Understand this is just for my
information, not for the record."</p>

<p>"If my opinion is of any value to you, sir, I should say no.
The young man's bearing was not that of a lover."</p>

<p>"And the lady's?"</p>

<p>"She was infatuated with him, sir. But saving myself, no one
would be likely to have perceived it. I have lived a long time
and have seen much."</p>

<p>"Is it your opinion, Hawkins, that Mr. Yohe shot Mr.
Gartrey?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir!" came the prompt reply. "I cannot conceive
of his doing such a thing! It is a great grief to me that I am
forced to give what appears to be damaging testimony against Mr.
Yohe. Such a merry young gentleman! Every servant in the house
was devoted to him. He didn't treat us like inferior beings, but
as his friends. He has a good heart, sir."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Lee, stroking his chin. This was not the sort of
answer he had expected; it didn't fit any of the possible
theories. It annoyed him. "And your master," he asked dryly,
"were you attached to him?"</p>

<p>"I could hardly say that, sir. Mr. Gartrey was a very reticent
man; he never, so to speak, unbent."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Gartrey?"</p>

<p>"A good mistress, Mr. Mappin; fair, and I may say, liberal.
But hardly to arouse any warmth of feeling, if you know what I
mean. She wouldn't have liked it."</p>

<p>"What were the relations between master and mistress?"</p>

<p>"Always polite, sir."</p>

<p>"Friendly?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly to say friendly, sir, but they never quarreled
before the servants."</p>

<p>"In these situations it is necessary to speak plainly,
Hawkins. Did they sleep together?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did other gentlemen come to see Mrs. Gartrey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, many gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Hawkins, can you be certain that there was no other gentleman
in the apartment on Monday when Mr. Gartrey was shot?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, sir. Why, how could he have got in without our
knowing it, or the elevator man, or the boys in the hall
downstairs?"</p>

<p>Lee spread out his hands. Realizing that he wasn't getting
very far, he changed his line. "Hawkins, is the Gartrey apartment
a duplex?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; all the rooms are on the same level."</p>

<p>"Where is the boudoir?"</p>

<p>"Facing the avenue in the bedroom wing, sir. There is a door
from the foyer into the bedroom corridor and in the corridor it's
the first door on your right."</p>

<p>"Can you draw me a rough plan?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir." Hawkins procured pencil and paper and
presently offered the result for Lee's inspection. "In the
bedroom wing, you see, sir, there are three rooms on the front.
They constitute Mrs. Gartrey's suite; boudoir, dressing room and
bedroom. Mr. Gartrey's bedroom and his study are across the
corridor."</p>

<p>"Now, to return to Monday," said Lee, "after you had shown Mr.
Yohe into the boudoir where did you go?"</p>

<p>"I returned to the pantry, sir. Monday afternoon is my time
for polishing the silver. I was not interrupted at it until I
heard the muffled shot in the foyer. You see, there was a hallway
with a door between."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't sure that it was a shot. No other sounds
followed. I listened for a moment or two, then I wiped my hands,
took off my baize apron, put on my coat and started for the hall
leading to the foyer. Before I reached it, Mr. Yohe appeared in
the opening. I said: 'Is there anything wrong, sir?' He didn't
answer me. He looked very wild. Perhaps he didn't hear. Crossing
the pantry, he went on out to the service door and disappeared
through it."</p>

<p>"You made no attempt to stop him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I only kept asking what was the matter. I was
dumbfounded!"</p>

<p>"What about his hat and coat?"</p>

<p>"Hat on his head, overcoat over his arm, sir."</p>

<p>Lee considered. "Hawkins," he said, "if you stopped to listen,
to take off your apron and put on your coat, a minute or so must
have passed since the shot was fired."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose Yohe was doing during that minute? He
seems to have been in a powerful hurry since he forgot the
gun."</p>

<p>"That has occurred to me, sir. It seems as if Mr. Yohe could
not have been in the foyer when the shot was fired. Of course, he
had to pick up his hat and coat, but that was right at hand. That
wouldn't have taken a minute."</p>

<p>"When he came through the door from the foyer, did he have
gloves on&mdash;or one glove?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, both his hands were bare."</p>

<p>"Could you swear to that?"</p>

<p>"Positively, sir."</p>

<p>"He had gloves with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I had seen them in the pocket of his topcoat when I
took it. Presumably they were still there."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a point in his favor."</p>

<p>Hawkins looked pleased.</p>

<p>"You then ran into the foyer?" Lee continued.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I lost a minute or two. I first ran after Mr.
Yohe, begging him to tell me what was the matter. I followed him
out to the service stairs. He ran down the stairs. I went back to
the foyer."</p>

<p>"Describe what you saw."</p>

<p>The old man was agitated now. His lip trembled, he paused to
pass a handkerchief over his face. Recovering himself, he said:
"My master was lying at full length on the floor just inside the
entrance door. He was lying partly on his right side and there
was a bullet hole in his left temple. He had been killed
instantly and he did not bleed much. His latchkey was in his
right hand; his hat had rolled away in front of him. The gun lay
about two yards from the body."</p>

<p>"On which side?"</p>

<p>"Toward the front of the building; that is to say, near the
opening into the music room." Hawkins illustrated on his
plan.</p>

<p>"Was it the custom of your master to let himself in without
ringing?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I had never known him to do such a thing. He might
open the door with his key, but he always rang outside to summon
a servant to take his hat and coat."</p>

<p>"You were the first on the scene. Who next appeared?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey and the maid, Eliza Young, sir. Eliza came out
of the bedroom corridor and Mrs. Gar-trey from the music
room."</p>

<p>"The music room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. There is a door between boudoir and music room."
Hawkins pointed to it on his plan. "It was really shorter for her
because there are two doors to open the other way."</p>

<p>"But why did she allow several minutes to elapse before she
appeared at all?"</p>

<p>"How can I answer that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"There was great confusion, Mr. Mappin. I'm afraid I cannot
give you a very clear account. The cook, the kitchen maid and the
two housemaids came. They were hysterical. I was the only man in
the house..."</p>

<p>"And you had your hands full," put in Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We employ a second man, John Denman by name, but he
had gone to the watchmaker's to have his watch repaired."</p>

<p>"What time did Denman go out?"</p>

<p>"Shortly after three, sir."</p>

<p>"After Mr. Yohe had come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What time did he return?"</p>

<p>"About four-thirty. The police had been in the apartment for
some time."</p>

<p>"Hawkins, what is your opinion of this man Denman?"</p>

<p>"Personally, I never cared for the young fellow, sir. Always
watching and listening; too sly for my taste. But he did his work
all right."</p>

<p>"How did your mistress bear herself, Hawkins?"</p>

<p>"She was shocked, sir. She looked awful."</p>

<p>"Hysterical?"</p>

<p>"Not her, sir. She kept quiet. She had her wits about
her."</p>

<p>"Did she approach the body?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. She told me to call a doctor. I said: 'Mr. Gartrey
is dead, Madam.' She said: 'Call a doctor anyhow.' I did so. I
then asked her if I should notify the police. She said: 'This is
not a case for the police; he killed himself.' She indicated the
gun. I pointed out to her that he still had the key in his right
hand. There is a doctor's office in the building and he came
immediately; Mrs. Gartrey's own physician a couple of minutes
later."</p>

<p>"Was there any other telephoning done?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not at that time. News of the shooting had spread
through the house and all kinds of people were trying to get into
the apartment. I had all I could do to keep them out. A policeman
came in off the street and it was him who telephoned to his
captain and the captain notified Headquarters. The confusion got
worse and worse until Mr. Coler came. He straightened us
out."</p>

<p>Lee thought this over, stroking his chin. "Hawkins," he said
finally, "I suppose there are many possible hiding places in that
big apartment."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. There is the coat closet in the foyer and there
is the powder room, opening off. The rear hall is lined with
cupboards which I have not indicated on the plan."</p>

<p>"Was the apartment searched for a possible skulker?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. We couldn't conceive how anybody could have got in
without being seen."</p>

<p>Lee said: "According to my recollection the entrance foyer is
sparsely furnished. Is there any piece of furniture behind which
an assassin could have concealed himself until Mr. Gartrey was
well inside the door?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. There is no furniture at all on that side of the
foyer."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Lee. "This is a hard nut that you have given me to
crack, Hawkins."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is the entrance door a self-closing one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Lee's further questioning elicited nothing material from the
old man. When Lee finally got up to leave, Hawkins said:</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>As Hawkins asked the question, Lee became aware that there was
another, a sharper personality peeping from behind the benignant
facade. But he could not be sure that it was evil.</p>

<p>"I am completely at sea," he said.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Yohe would only come back and clear himself !" sighed
the old man.</p>

<p>"So say we all of us!" agreed Lee.</p>

<p>As Lee came down the stairs on his way out, the courteous
landlady appeared below to open the door for him. Lee's eyes
twinkled behind the polished glasses.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Quimby, do you ever cash checks?" he asked. Naturally,
she was astonished. "Why...why...why for my lodgers, sir, not for
strangers."</p>

<p>"Where does Mr. Hawkins bank?"</p>

<p>She was so flustered that she answered without thinking. "At
the Girard National, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said Lee. "Don't mention to anybody that
I asked you."</p>

<p>Out on the sidewalk he glanced at his watch. Being Saturday,
the bank would be closed, but there might be somebody on the
premises.</p>

<p>He taxied into the city and found a vice president at the
Girard National. Lee, introducing himself, stated his errand and
the vice president sent for a bookkeeper with his ledger. This
man said:</p>

<p>"The account of Robert Hawkins was opened two days ago with a
deposit of $2,500. This was a cashier's check from a New York
bank. This morning Mr. Hawkins is credited with cash, $5,000,
deposited here in the banking house."</p>

<p>Lee's face was like a mask. "Is the teller who took the money
available?"</p>

<p>He was presently produced, a slender, pale young man with an
expression of anxiety, wondering why he had been sent for from
the front office.</p>

<p>"This deposit in cash to the credit of Robert Hawkins," said
the vice president, "do you remember who made it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the circumstances being a little unusual. It was a
young gentleman, sir; good-looking, extremely well dressed. I
took him for a junior partner in a prominent law firm, or a
stockbroker."</p>

<p>"In what form was the money?"</p>

<p>"Tens and twenties, sir."</p>

<p>"Were the numbers taken?" Lee put in.</p>

<p>"No, sir. They were mixed old bills. Just put in with our
cash, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you be able to recognize the man who deposited
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. A very handsome young fellow, sir."</p>

<p>"Please say nothing about this for the present."</p>

<p><br> On his return to New York, Lee reported the result of his
mission to Inspector Loasby, and convinced him of the necessity
of keeping the discovery to themselves until they could trace the
source of Hawkins' bonus. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">ON Sunday mornings Mr. Mappin permitted himself
an extra half hour in bed, no more. If he had been up late on
Saturday night, he found it refreshing to take a cat nap or a
couple of cat naps later in the day. Having finished his
breakfast by the fire, he was leaning back thoughtfully smoking a
cigarette. Today the dressing gown was orange faced with black;
the scarf and slippers scarlet. There was a line between his
brows and he was not thinking serenely of his big book. What he
termed to himself "that infernal Gartrey case" had driven it out
of his head. He admitted, however, that l'affaire Gar-trey was
not as obvious and common as it had seemed at first. It had
become a puzzle.</p>

<p>He heard the distant sound of the doorbell without concern. He
kept his home address a secret so far as was possible and it, of
course, did not appear in the telephone book. All sorts of
nuisances occasionally came to the door, but he could depend on
the efficient Jermyn to protect him. He was therefore surprised
to see Jermyn enter, wearing an odd expression which suggested
that something had turned up which was too much for him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Lee a little sharply.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Mappin, there's...there's a young lady
calling."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Jermyn! At nine o'clock on Sunday morning!
What's her excuse?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say what she wanted, sir, but she wrote her name
on a piece of paper." Jermyn extended the paper.</p>

<p>Taking it, Lee read: "Mrs. Alastair Yohe."</p>

<p>"Jehu, Kingdom come!" he exclaimed. "This is
impossible!...This is a practical joker, Jermyn, or a newspaper
woman in disguise!"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head. "No, sir! A very personable young lady,
sir, and appears to be in great trouble."</p>

<p>Lee noted that he had twice spoken of her as a lady. Jermyn
was never the one to apply the term lightly. Lee was divided in
his mind; curiosity was working powerfully; on the other hand,
"great trouble" promised the kind of emotional scene that he
detested. He said: "You'd better go into the kitchen where you
can't be overheard, and call up Inspector Loasby. You'll find him
at his home. Tell him who our caller is, and let him take what
action seems best."</p>

<p>Jermyn's generally inexpressive face betrayed the keenest
distress. "Oh, no, Mr. Mappin! If you please, sir! Oh, Mr.
Mappin, you can't go for to do that!"</p>

<p>"Why can't I?"</p>

<p>"She has a baby, sir!"</p>

<p>Lee stared, openmouthed. "A baby, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a fine, pretty child."</p>

<p>"What's a baby got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have the heart to turn them over to the police,
sir."</p>

<p>"Well...well..." said Lee pettishly, "you needn't telephone to
Loasby...But I won't see her! The baby is just an excuse for sob
stuff. No sensible woman would bring a baby! Send them away!"</p>

<p>As Jermyn turned, Lee heard a gentle voice from the door
saying: "<i>Please</i>, Mr. Mappin, I won't make a nuisance of
myself. I won't stay but five minutes!"</p>

<p>Lee jumped up in great perturbation, drawing his dressing gown
around him like a woman caught in her wrapper, and saying:
"Really, young lady! Really! This is too much!" He looked around
for Jermyn, but Jermyn had slipped incontinently through the
dining-room door, leaving him to face the monster alone. Finding
himself trapped, Lee looked the intruder straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"I know this is dreadful of me," she was saying imploringly,
"but I felt desperate!"</p>

<p>She was a pretty thing, small and young. Lee had not realized
that girls so young had babies. The baby looked enormous; he
didn't see how such a little woman could possibly have produced
it. "Well, as long as you're here you may as well come in," he
said gracelessly.</p>

<p>She glided in and, dropping on a chair behind the settee,
started nervously to unfasten the baby's jacket and cap. "I'm not
preparing to make a stay," she said deprecatingly, "but I'm
afraid he might catch cold when we go out again."</p>

<p>Lee, inexperienced with babies, was very ill at ease in the
presence of the unfamiliar. He had no idea how old the child
might be; he was able to sit up but had clearly not reached the
walking or talking stage. She took his cap off and smoothed down
the fuzz on his head.</p>

<p>"Hasn't got much more hair than I have," said Lee grimly.</p>

<p>"He will have," she said quickly. "See how thickly it's coming
in."</p>

<p>Lee declined to approach. "How old is he?"</p>

<p>"Going on nine months...Weighs eighteen pounds," she added
proudly.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, how did you do it!" said Lee.</p>

<p>She blushed. "That's what everybody asks me. I guess the size
of the mother doesn't make much difference."</p>

<p>The baby looked around the room with a bland expression. Lee,
he ignored in the most insulting fashion, but that pleased Lee;
at least, the baby was not going to try to get around him. When
she had taken off his outer things, his mother planted him on the
rug in front of the fire. It was a rare Bokhara.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better put something under him?" suggested
Lee.</p>

<p>"He has his rubber pants on," his mother said, a little
hurt.</p>

<p>Lee blushed. There was a silence. The baby evidently enjoyed
the fire for he crowed and bounced two or three times on his
fundament. Lee felt softer feelings stealing over him. "What's
his name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Alastair," she said with a lift in her voice, "but we call
him Lester."</p>

<p>That name chilled Lee. Spawn of the devil! he thought.</p>

<p>"My name is Charlotte," she added navely.</p>

<p>"Have you breakfasted?" Lee asked, with stiff politeness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you." Such a pretty little brown-haired girl,
sensitive, prone to blush, her face revealing quick changes of
expression.</p>

<p>Lee jerked his head toward the little Buddha on the rug.
"Isn't there something I can get for him?"</p>

<p>"A soda cracker, perhaps, if you would be so good. He's always
hungry."</p>

<p>Lee rang for Jermyn and ordered soda crackers, looking very
stern. Jermyn's face was like wood. When he brought the crackers
the young mother offered one to her child. He knew what to do
with it. Calmly accepting it, he conveyed it to his mouth and
returned his gaze to the fire.</p>

<p>After an awkward period Lee and Mrs. Yohe found themselves
talking together naturally enough.</p>

<p>"You know why I am here," she said simply. "It is to beg you
to receive my husband. Our happiness, our very lives depend upon
it." She nodded toward the child. "And his. He has such a long
time to live!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is impossible," said Lee.</p>

<p>"My husband is innocent."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"He told me so."</p>

<p>Lee smiled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yohe blushed, but spoke up with spirit. "I'm not just a
fond and foolish little wife. I have no illusions about my
husband. He has told me many painful truths, heartbreaking
truths, but he has never lied to me.</p>

<p>"But in this case wouldn't he be justified in lying?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But I know him so well that if he was lying for
the first time some change in his voice, in his expression would
warn me of it."</p>

<p>"If he's innocent, for heaven's sake why doesn't he face the
music?"</p>

<p>"Ah, he's a strange, wild creature, Mr. Mappin. To be confined
would kill him."</p>

<p>Lee said nothing. His expression was politely incredulous.</p>

<p>"He has other reasons," she went on. "I don't know what they
are, but they seem sufficient to him. I'm not claiming that he is
very wise, Mr. Mappin. Like all manly men, he's as stubborn as
the devil. Oh, if you would only consent to see him; I am certain
he would do whatever you advised. Look, he thinks you have one of
the keenest minds of the day. If he were not innocent, would he
be so anxious to put himself in your hands?"</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "Very subtle flattery, Mrs. Yohe."</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to flatter you. Oh, if I could only find the
right word!"</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he write his story for me? I will guarantee that
no eye shall see it but mine."</p>

<p>"He says he can't express himself properly in writing; that
his brain seems to freeze when he takes a pen in hand."</p>

<p>"He could call me up on the telephone. If he uses a dial phone
the call could not be traced back."</p>

<p>She still shook her head. "There is too much at stake. He must
be able to see your face when he tells you. He wants you to
question him."</p>

<p>"Here's a proposition," said Lee. "If I consent to hear his
story, will he agree to give himself up if I so advise?"</p>

<p>"He would give himself up, I am sure, but he would never bind
himself in advance to do so. He doesn't know you, you see, and
after all, it is his life which is at stake. He is convinced that
it would be fatal if he fell into the hands of the police now.
He'd be railroaded, he says."</p>

<p>"That's as far as I can go," said Lee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yohe squeezed her hands together. "Oh, if he does not
succeed, I know what will happen! He will leave Lester and me and
start a new life far away. We will never see him again!"</p>

<p>"Abandon you!" exclaimed Lee.</p>

<p>"I don't mean leave us to starve. There is plenty of money.
But a man always has that way out, hasn't he? Just to go
away."</p>

<p>"The search for him will never be abandoned!" asserted
Lee.</p>

<p>"The police aren't very clever, Mr. Mappin. Certainly not
clever enough to take my husband unless he allows himself to be
taken."</p>

<p>Lee rose and paced back and forth. "Mrs. Yohe, what you have
told me about your husband doesn't make me feel any kinder toward
him. Even before this happened, he appears to have treated you
abominably; A secret marriage! I take it you are forced to live
under an assumed name."</p>

<p>She nodded miserably.</p>

<p>"It has cut you off from your own people?" Another
nod&mdash;but with firm lips.</p>

<p>"And, of course, you have to do your own housework besides
caring for the baby. You couldn't trust a servant."</p>

<p>"I went into it with my eyes open, Mr. Mappin. He did not
deceive me. He explained the kind of life he led and that the
secrecy would be necessary until he had made a sufficient stake
for us to get a fair start away from New York." Her chin went
higher. "And I'm not sorry for what I did, either! Even if the
worst should happen, even if he leaves us, I shall not be sorry
for what I did. And Lester won't reproach me for it, either, when
I tell him about it after he grows up."</p>

<p>Lee paced up and down snorting with indignation. "But, my dear
child, this is mere infatuation!"</p>

<p>"Infatuation!" she repeated with a scornful shrug. "That's
only a word! I don't care what you call it. It is something that
comes to only a few women. It has lifted me out of myself! It
makes me feel rich!"</p>

<p>Lee could no longer trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>She partly broke down. "Oh, I have said the wrong things!" she
mourned. "I wanted to make you understand what a dear he is! how
tender and honest and goodhearted! And I have only made you
angry! If you could see him and Lester romping together, it would
melt your heart! A man who can laugh with a baby can't be a bad
man!"</p>

<p>This unhappy scene could have but one conclusion. She finally
picked up the baby and started putting on his jacket with
trembling fingers while the tears rolled down her soft cheeks.
Lee felt like a louse; no good for him to tell himself that he
was taking the only possible course. Word of this will be
conveyed to Fanny and Judy, he thought, and my life at the office
will be a purgatory. He rang for Jermyn. When Jermyn saw the wet
cheeks, his eyes reproached his master too. Hell! thought Lee,
was ever a well-meaning man put in such a box! As Jermyn showed
Mrs. Yohe out, Lee thought: She will go blindly through the
streets. If I sent Jermyn after her, she would lead him straight
to Yohe. She's undoubtedly hiding him herself. But, damn it all!
I can't do it! </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">DURING the rest of Sunday the relations between
Jermyn and his master were a little strained. Lee did not go out
and wore his dressing gown all day. It was his custom to sup
alone in his apartment on Sunday evenings. Lee was a sociable
soul but, as he said, in order to fully appreciate good society,
it is necessary for a man to spend certain hours in solitude.
Late in the afternoon Jermyn came to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, I dislike to ask an extra favor of you, you are
always so considerate, but I have had a telephone message from my
friend Abbott in Brooklyn&mdash;he's the one who came to this
country with me&mdash;saying that he was ill and out of a place
and asking me to come over and see him."</p>

<p>Lee was relieved at the thought of being spared the sight of
Jermyn's long face for an hour or two. "Go by all means," he
said.</p>

<p>"I'll serve your supper first, sir. Unless you would prefer to
eat at the Club."</p>

<p>"I'll eat at home," said Lee. "Not in the humor for
company."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>When Lee sat down to his supper he said: "You needn't wait,
Jermyn. Get yourself a bite to eat and be off with you."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, I will; and thank you, sir. Just leave
everything until I get home, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"On your way out," said Lee, "instruct the men in the hall
downstairs that if anybody comes to see me while you're gone, the
name is to be telephoned up to me."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>When he had finished eating, Lee returned to the fire,
prepared to spend a comfortable evening with a book and a pipe.
Lee had a secret fondness for the briar, but as he fancied it
went very ill with his tubby little figure, he smoked it only
when alone. "I am no Sherlock Holmes, alas!" he would say. He was
reading <i>The Case of Madeleine Smith</i> in connection with his
work. The pipe drew well, the case was well presented, but the
feeling of comfort would not come. The sad, pale, tear-stained
face of Mrs. Yohe rose between his eyes and the printed page.
Half a dozen times he jumped up swearing, took a turn up and down
the room, and sat down again with a determined effort to
concentrate on the book.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang; the button was pushed three times, long,
short, long. This was a private signal known only to Jermyn, to
Fanny and Judy and one or two of Lee's closest friends. He heard
it with pleasure and jumped up; anything would be preferable to
his own nagging thoughts. Trundling down the hall without a
thought of danger, he opened the door.</p>

<p>It was not a friend. Lee saw a tallish, well-made young man,
very well dressed, smiling like a book agent. He had glasses on
and wore a neat, black beard like a young doctor trying to make
himself look more impressive, or a Bohemian from south of
Fourteenth Street. His bared teeth gleamed with extraordinary
whiteness against the black beard. He had blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin," he began ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>Lee, angered by his effrontery, began to say: "I'm sorry, sir,
I cannot..."</p>

<p>The elevator had gone down again and the little hall was
empty. The young man suddenly lunged with his shoulder against
the door, thrusting it open and sending Lee staggering back. He
coolly entered, closing the door behind him, keeping his
extraordinarily bright eyes fixed on Lee's face and smiling in
that maddening fashion. In addition to the Yale lock, there was
an ordinary lock in the door and the key was sticking in it. He
turned the key and, pulling it out, dropped it in his pocket. He
kept saying:</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Mr. Mappin! Honestly I hate to do this!"</p>

<p>He seemed to be struggling to keep from laughing outright, and
that made Lee feel wild with anger. Suddenly he thought of the
house phone on the wall. The young man thought of it at the same
instant and reached it first. He already had a pair of cutters in
his hand and he snipped the wires leading to the instrument.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry!" he said, biting his lip.</p>

<p>A cold fear struck through Lee; the fellow was so much bigger
than he, and twenty years younger. He was undoubtedly armed.
Lee's gun was in the drawer of the chiffonier in his dressing
room at the other end of the apartment.</p>

<p>"I must ask you to enter the pantry ahead of me," the young
man said.</p>

<p>Lee was forced to obey. There was a miniature telephone
switchboard in the pantry. Here incoming calls were received and
could be plugged to the several extensions in different rooms.
The young man snipped the main wires leading to the board.</p>

<p>"When I go out," he said deprecatingly, "I'll phone for a
trouble shooter so service can be restored tonight."</p>

<p>Lee felt absolutely helpless. The building was of steel and
concrete construction and it would do him no good to shout for
help or pound on the floor. "What do you want of me?" he
demanded. "I keep no money about me."</p>

<p>"I don't want your money," answered the young man, smiling
afresh. "Lead the way to your dressing room, please."</p>

<p>They proceeded through the gallery. Lee's feeling that he had
been betrayed by one whom he trusted was bitterer than fear. "How
did you get up here?" he asked.</p>

<p>The young man read his mind. "Jermyn didn't sell you out," he
said. "I decoyed him over to Brooklyn with a fake telephone call.
I guessed that the boys downstairs would be instructed not to let
anybody up without telephoning, so I didn't ask for you; I just
walked into the elevator as if I belonged in the house. `Top
floor,' I said, and the operator was bluffed."</p>

<p>They entered Lee's little dressing room and the young man went
direct to the chiffonier and pulled out the drawer where Lee's
gun lay. Certainly if Jermyn had not betrayed his master,
somebody had. Lee thought of the girls and his breast was curdled
with bitterness. However, the first shock had passed and his wits
were working again. The drawer was filled with socks and
handkerchiefs and the young man had to dig for the gun. Lee was
standing behind him at the moment and the dressing table was
behind Lee. A crazy plan began to work in his brain. He felt
behind him for a nail file and a tiny sewing case that lay on the
table. He found the objects, and transferred them to the pocket
of his dressing gown.</p>

<p>The young man dropped the gun in his pocket and turned around.
"Shall we go into the living room and sit down comfortably?" he
suggested. He had the pleasantest voice in the world, damn him!
thought Lee.</p>

<p>Lee with an effort changed his face. "Well, I suppose I might
as well make the best of it," he said.</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried the other. "I'm really not a bad sort of fellow.
I mean you no harm. I want you to be my friend."</p>

<p>Lee had guessed who it was. Searching for a way of distracting
the fellow's attention from himself, he said: "Will you have
something to eat? My supper is still on the table."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I don't mind if I do," was the instant reply. "I've
been so busy this afternoon I couldn't stop for supper."</p>

<p>"Preparing for this visit?" suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It took some close planning."</p>

<p>They proceeded to the dining room and sat down. There was
plenty of food left on the table; a cold pt, a salad, a
Camembert cheese spreading on its plate. The young man's blue
eyes glistened at the sight. Pulling the dishes toward him, he
set to with a hearty appetite.</p>

<p>"You and I have similar tastes," he said.</p>

<p>Lee was listening intently. Faint sounds reached his ears
which suggested that Tod Larkey on the floor below was having a
party. One of Lee's living-room windows was open and there must
have been an open window somewhere in the Larkey apartment also.
It was the party which had given Lee his idea. He had only a
nodding acquaintance with Larkey, but it would serve.</p>

<p>While the young man ate he kept a bright eye on Lee, but he
could not look at him steadily because of having to attend to his
food. Lee was trying to think of a way to escape from his eye for
half a minute at a time. Half a minute would be enough.</p>

<p>Lee rose. "I'll fetch you a bottle of cold beer from the
refrigerator."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Mappin!" said the young man quickly. "I can't
risk having you pop out through the service entrance, you know.
You sit here and I'll fetch the beer. Will you join me in a
bottle?"</p>

<p>"Don't mind if I do," said Lee.</p>

<p>The young man went through the swing door into the pantry. Lee
had gained his half minute. Whipping out his notebook, he wrote
on a page: "Help! Lee Mappin," tore the page out and returned
book and page to his pocket. The young man came in with the
beer.</p>

<p>As he sat down again he said: "I reckon you have guessed who I
am."</p>

<p>"I have guessed it," said Lee dryly.</p>

<p>The young man said with his gleaming smile: "The beard is
false, the hair dyed and the spectacles unnecsary." As he spoke
he transferred the glasses to his pocket. Lee recognized him as
the host of the Sourabaya night club.</p>

<p>An appealing quality came into his smile. "I took an awful
risk in coming here against your will, but I was desperate. Only
you can save me and my little family."</p>

<p>Lee hardened his heart against him. "You took no risk at all,"
he said coolly. "Your errand was doomed to failure before you
started."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Did you think you could win me over at the point of a gun? I
may look like a timid little fellow, but after all!..."</p>

<p>Al Yohe's face fell. "I haven't pointed a gun," he said. "As a
matter of fact, I didn't bring one."</p>

<p>"You've got mine!"</p>

<p>Al pulled himself together. "Well, anyhow, as long as I'm
here, you might as well hear my story."</p>

<p>"I can't avoid hearing it," said Lee.</p>

<p>While they talked, his hand was busy in his pocket. The sewing
case was a little roll of leather which contained two spools of
thread, a few needles and pins, a thimble. Old-fashioned people
call it a bachelor's companion. Unrolling it, Lee worked one of
the spools out and measured off thread as well as he could in his
pocket. He glanced at the height of the ceiling; say nine feet;
he would need ten feet of thread.</p>

<p>Al said glumly: "This is not going to be easy if you have
resolved to set your face against me...However, I must do the
best I can." He spread Camembert on a cracker and put it in his
mouth. "My interview with Mrs. Gartrey last Monday was a stormy
one. She didn't mention that, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Were you in love with her?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"No, that was the trouble."</p>

<p>"She was in love with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God forgive me, and how! I couldn't string her along any
further. She insisted on what she called a showdown. There
was..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interrupted Lee. "This doesn't exactly
recommend you to me. Under the circumstances, why did you
continue going to her house?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, I'm not going to try to make myself out any
better than I am. You may call me a buccaneer or worse, if you
like, but I'm no murderer." He broke off to say with a boyish
smile: "Lord! I wish I could call you Pop like the girls at the
office. It suits you so well!" He paused, studying Lee's face,
then said with a sigh: "But I guess I better not try it!"</p>

<p>Lee said to himself: He's just turning on his "charm."</p>

<p>Al resumed: "When I came to New York and was introduced to
cafe society, those people, rich as Croesus, unstable as monkeys,
empty as blown eggs, I made up my mind to prey on them in a
perfectly legitimate way. They craved amusement, being too stupid
to amuse themselves, and I was clever enough to furnish it. They
were ripe for the picking! I amused them and I flattered them. My
God! do you blame me? The merest fraction of Jules Gartrey's
income would keep my family in luxury for years!</p>

<p>"As to the reputation J have acquired as a great lover, I
didn't foresee that. I swear to you, Mr. Map-pin, that I never
made love to their women, you can believe me or not. If you were
to ask an honest woman, a woman, say, like Delphine Harley, she
would bear me out. As a matter of fact, those empty-headed bits
of artifice didn't appeal to me. I like a more natural article.
But 'making love' is the principal occupation of these monkeys,
and out of sheer perversity, just because I <i>didn't</i> make
love to them, the women began throwing themselves at my head. It
became the fashion to fall for Al Yohe. My God, could I help
it?"</p>

<p>Lee was sufficiently well acquainted with the gilded crust of
society to recognize the truth in what Al said. But it didn't
make him feel any kinder toward Al. He said: "Perhaps not. But
you haven't answered my question. Why did you continue stringing
Agnes Gar-trey along when you saw how things were going?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Mappin. I thought the answer to that was
obvious. The Gartreys are topnotchers in that set. He was one of
the richest men in New York and she is called the most beautiful
woman. They were necessary to me. You may think I have an easy
job. Well, so has the man who dances on a slack wire. But he
can't relax. I was all puffed up by publicity, but a prick would
have deflated me. I had to have eyes all round my head to watch
for danger. After all, I was nobody; I had to hang on to those
who had something. That's why the Gartreys were essential to me.
Particularly the old man. It may surprise you to learn that that
hard-boiled old geezer was susceptible to flattery. Well, he was,
and I knew how to feed it to him. It was he who put up the money
to decorate La Sourabaya in its present sumptuous style. A cool
two hundred thousand. And, by the way, I wish somebody would give
me a reason why I should have killed the goose that laid the
golden eggs."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lee dryly, "my question is answered. Let's
get back to Monday afternoon."</p>

<p>Al Yohe rose from the table. "Thanks for a swell meal," he
said. "I feel like a new man. Shall we go into the living
room?"</p>

<p>They passed through glass doors into the larger room. Al
looked around him appreciatively. "Gosh! what a swell place! It
looks like the home of a gentleman and a scholar!"</p>

<p>Lee pushed the embers of the fire together and put on fresh
wood. Al accepted a cigar and, lighting it, drew in the smoke
gratefully. "This must be a private importation," he said. "Such
cigars are not for sale." He dropped on a settee at right angles
to the fire, stretching his long legs before him.</p>

<p>Lee looked down at him grimly. Handsome, well made, gay and
clever, Lee could not help but be attracted. A young man nowadays
finds the world a pretty rotten sort of place, he thought; can
you blame him for turning buccaneer? He shook this feeling off.
Are you going to let him charm you, too? he asked himself.</p>

<p>Lee by this time had broken off ten feet of thread in his
pocket, as nearly as he could judge it. He needed another minute
alone in order to tie thread to nail file. He went to his little
wall cupboard. "Have a liqueur?" he said. "I have brandy,
Cointreau, and some of the veritable Chartreuse. For myself I
prefer Scotch and soda."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Al.</p>

<p>"You'll have to fetch ice cubes from the refrigerator,
then."</p>

<p>"Sure!" Al hastened out.</p>

<p>Left alone, Lee measured his piece of thread against his arm.
The length was about right. He tied the end to the nail file, and
pinned the file through the note he had written. Hearing Al
coming back, he thrust it all in his pocket.</p>

<p>The drinks were mixed and they sat down facing each other on
the two sofas. "Go on with your story," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Agnes Gartrey was bent on having what she called a showdown,"
said Al contemptuously. "I expect you know what that means;
crying, beating herself, pulling her hair out straight. Lord! if
I could have photographed her then! Most men are scared out of
their wits by that kind of show, but not me! It turns me
hard."</p>

<p>"Did she want you to marry her?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"No indeed, she had no intention of separating herself from
Moneybags."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"I was afraid somebody would hear her. I knew Gartrey would be
home sometime or other, though I didn't expect him so soon. I
didn't want him to smell a rat. He has a mortgage on the
Sourabaya. So I suggested to Agnes that we go somewhere where we
could talk privately."</p>

<p>"Where could you go where you wouldn't be recognized?"</p>

<p>"To my place. It was all I could think of. She rose to that;
thought she'd have me dead to rights in my place, but I didn't
have any intention of taking her there. So she went into the next
room, her dressing room, to get ready."</p>

<p>"Was the maid in there?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then she must have heard all that was said."</p>

<p>"Sure. Probably had her ear glued to the crack of the door.
However, I don't suppose that Eliza has many illusions about her
mistress left. Women like Agnes feel pretty safe with their
maids, because, you see, if a maid ever blew the gaff on her
mistress and it became known, no other woman would hire her."</p>

<p>"I am learning," said Lee. "Go on."</p>

<p>"When Agnes went into the dressing room, she left the door
partly open and we continued talking back and forth, though of
course she wasn't cursing me like she did before. Then after a
bit somebody pulled the door shut and I could hear no more from
in there."</p>

<p>"You couldn't hear the two women talking?"</p>

<p>"Not a sound."</p>

<p>Lee got up. "Don't you find it a little chilly here?" he
casually suggested.</p>

<p>"Suits me all right," said Al.</p>

<p>Lee went to the open window. That end of the big room was in
darkness. Leaning out of the window, he satisfied himself that it
was not the window immediately underneath which was open. So much
the better. It gave him a larger area of glass to tap on. Keeping
hold of the end of the thread, he dropped the nail file over the
sill and had the satisfaction of hearing it knock against the
glass below. He pulled down the sash, pinning the end of the
thread under it.</p>

<p>"Lovely night," he said, returning to the fire, "but turning
colder...Go on with your story."</p>

<p>"I was sitting in the boudoir, twiddling my thumbs while Agnes
changed into street clothes in her dressing-room. Quite a while
passed. I thought nothing of that, because getting dressed to a
woman like Agnes is the most important thing in life." Al paused,
staring straight ahead of him. "God! how vividly that moment
comes back! Me sitting there in the pink boudoir surrounded by
Agnes' gimcracks&mdash;she collects antique porcelain figures
just because they're expensive...and the shot out in the
foyer!"</p>

<p>He was silent so long that Lee was forced to prompt him. "Go
on!"</p>

<p>Al passed a hand over his face. "It gave me a horrible shock!
I guess things have always come to me too easy. First time I ever
had to face anything serious...I thought Agnes had turned a gun
against herself. I had never for a moment taken her seriously,
but you can't tell about a woman. What a spot for me to be in!
Made me feel sick. My one idea was to get out of the place, but I
couldn't get out without passing through the foyer. I ran out
there..."</p>

<p>"Which way?" put in Lee.</p>

<p>"By the corridor. Agnes was lying against the door into the
foyer. But when I turned her over I saw she had no wound. She had
fainted. I stepped over her and went into the foyer. I saw
Gartrey lying on the parquet floor with a bullet hole in his
head. I knew he was dead. I saw the gun and I thought he had shot
himself. That made me feel a little better because it wasn't my
fault if his wife...Well, anyhow, my one idea was to beat it away
from there. Can you blame me? I got my hat and coat out of the
hall closet and started for the service entrance. Unluckily I met
the butler on the way out and that put the kibosh on my chances
of clearing myself. Naturally I looked wild."</p>

<p>"When you ran into the foyer did you see anybody?" asked
Lee.</p>

<p>"Nobody but the dead man."</p>

<p>"It's your idea, I take it, that Gartrey was shot by his
wife?"</p>

<p>"I'm not saying so," said Al. "I want you to figure it out for
yourself."</p>

<p>"What motive had she for killing her husband?"</p>

<p>Al shrugged. "How can a man tell what goes through a crazy
woman's mind? A spoiled beauty like Agnes believes that nothing
can touch her. She would figure that with her money and her
position she could get away with it. Perhaps she thought that
after she had inherited Gartrey's millions I would be crazy
enough to marry her. But I don't think that. If she had all that
money, why should she marry again? I believe she planned to plant
the crime on me, thinking she could get me off later and that she
would then have me under her thumb for keeps. Or perhaps in her
rage she was deliberately trying to send me to the chair. That
would explain the gun."</p>

<p>"How did your gun get there?" asked Lee mildly. Al shrugged.
"All I know is, it was stolen from me."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that. I didn't miss it until after this
happened. It's a couple of months since I have seen it."</p>

<p>"Where did you keep it?"</p>

<p>"In a chest of drawers in my bedroom."</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Gartrey know it was there?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"Has she ever been in your apartment?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"In the bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Al smiled suddenly. "But not with me! She went in to
powder her nose."</p>

<p>"Has Robert Hawkins, her ex-butler, been to your place?" asked
Lee.</p>

<p>Al looked at him quickly. "Why do you ask that?...Oh, I see,
you are canvassing all the possibilities. Yes, Hawkins has been
there on two occasions. The old boy had an interest in
photography, and I told him to come around and get a few pointers
on developing. The last time was about ten days ago. I left him
in the kitchen, washing prints while I went into the dark room I
have improvised. He could have gone into the bedroom without my
knowing it."</p>

<p>"And the maid, Eliza Young?"</p>

<p>"She has been to my place three or four times with notes from
Agnes. Agnes considered telephoning unsafe because the calls at
her home went through a switchboard in the pantry. Eliza might
have been in my bedroom&mdash;she's a sly one !&mdash;because
sometimes I was busy with my work in the kitchen when she came
and had to let her wait in the living room for a while."</p>

<p>"Have other people visited your rooms?"</p>

<p>"Oh, many others. It was a kind of hangout; there was always
something to drink there. They made themselves free of the place;
they would roam around. I was often busy in the dark room or
kitchen...I'll make a list of everybody I can remember and send
it to you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lee dryly. "I have not yet promised to give my
time to this matter."</p>

<p>Al smiled in his most ingratiating manner. "What have you got
against me, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Let's not go into that. Answer one question. If it is true
you thought Gartrey had killed himself, it is not unnatural you
should have thought only of getting out of the place; but next
day, when you read the newspapers and learned that he had not
killed himself, that, in fact, you were accused of the crime, why
didn't you give yourself up? That's the natural impulse of an
innocent man."</p>

<p>"Try to put yourself in my place, sir," Al said cajolingly.
"Hawkins' story was enough to send me straight to the chair! And
such an honest-looking old bozo; anybody would believe him. I
could see that I was already convicted in the minds of the
public. What kind of a defense had I? I could only clear myself
by accusing Agnes. What would everybody have said then? Believing
that we were lovers, they would say that I had allowed the woman
to do the killing so we could come together, and was now accusing
her to save my own skin. By God! I couldn't bear that. I would
sooner..."</p>

<p>At this moment the bell of Lee's apartment sounded. Al jumped
up all alert. "You'll have to go to the door," he said. "They
know you're home."</p>

<p>Lee's first thought was regret that he had hung out his tick-tack
so soon. He wanted to ask Al more questions. Somebody began
to pound on his door and voices called for him. Al was already
halfway through the dining room; Lee followed him. Through the
pantry door he went; and into the kitchen. He opened the service
door. With his hand on the door, smiling still, he said:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Pop. You're a good fellow! Sorry I couldn't win you
over!"</p>

<p>The door slammed, and Lee stood staring at it blankly. A
renewed uproar at the other door recalled him to himself. Running
to it, he shouted to those on the other side. "This door is
locked and the key is gone! Alastair Yohe is on his way down the
service stairs!"</p>

<p>"Who?" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Alastair Yohe!"</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>"Ring for the elevator and cut him off at the bottom! Some of
you run down the stairs in case the elevator is slow in
coming."</p>

<p>"Use the house phone!" a voice shouted.</p>

<p>"I can't! The wires are cut."</p>

<p>He heard the door to the stair well being pulled open and
running feet on the steps. He doubted, however, if any of Tod
Larkey's guests were nimble enough to beat Al Yohe to the bottom.
All would depend on how quickly the elevator came up. Lee
returned to his living room and mixed himself a stiff drink.</p>

<p>In ten minutes or so they were back at Lee's door. They had
the superintendent of the building with them, who brought a
duplicate key. Half a dozen men pushed in through the door. Tod
Larkey's party, it appeared, was a stag affair. His guests were
flushed and a little unsteady on their pins.</p>

<p>"He got away!" they all cried at once.</p>

<p>In spite of the self-discipline he had exerted, Lee's first
feeling was one of gladness. He took care to hide it. One man
cried:</p>

<p>"I saw him! I ran around the corner to the service entrance
and he was getting in a car. The engine was running. The rear
light was out and I couldn't read the license number."</p>

<p>All together they demanded to know what had happened.</p>

<p>Lee was in no humor to take this noisy bunch into his
confidence. "I'm sorry," he said, "I can't tell you the story
until I have reported it to the police. You'll learn it soon
enough. Mr. Larkey, if you'll allow me, I'd like to call up
Inspector Loasby on your phone. My wire is out."</p>

<p>They trooped down the single flight of stairs to the Larkey
apartment. Larkey and his guests had their ears pricked to hear
Lee's report over the phone, but upon getting Loasby at his home,
Lee merely said:</p>

<p>"Inspector, can you come down to my place right away? It's
important."</p>

<p>"Well," said Loasby reluctantly, "I have guests. Can't you
tell me what it is over the phone?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lee.</p>

<p>Loasby knew, of course, that Lee was neither a trifler nor a
scaremonger, and he wasted no more words. "Okay," he said, "I'll
be there in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Declining all offers of a drink, Lee, after thanking his
"rescuers," went back upstairs. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">JERMYN got home before Inspector Loasby arrived.
The good fellow was flabbergasted when he learned what had
happened. "I'll never leave you alone in the apartment again!" he
vowed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Lee, "This sort of thing isn't going to
happen twice!"</p>

<p>"My friend wasn't sick at all. It was a fake call, Mr.
Mappin."</p>

<p>"So Al told me," said Lee dryly. Lee could not help but
believe Jermyn; his honesty was transparent. It was clear,
however, that somebody else had furnished Mr. Al with advance
information.</p>

<p>Loasby was astonished and outraged when he heard the story.
"The fellow is a devil! a devil!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Well, after all he didn't do me any harm," said Lee; "though
I confess it is rather humiliating to be kept a prisoner in your
own house...Anyhow, I'm in this case up to my neck now, but I'm
working with you, Inspector, not with Al Yohe."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Loasby. "We'll soon collar him...What do you
suggest, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"You must comb the town. We know the nature of his disguise
now, and he's hardly likely to get up another as good. Every
young man with a beard of any color should be detained for
questioning."</p>

<p>"Sure. Somebody is keeping him under cover. Some woman."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly." Though he knew he was doing wrong and suspected
that it might very well get him into trouble with the police
later, Lee simply could not bring himself to tell Loasby about
the little wife and her baby.</p>

<p>After the excitement in the apartment house, Loasby insisted
that they must give the story of Al Yohe's visit to the press.
"They'll get a garbled version of it anyhow from those guys
downstairs, and if the newspaper boys get the idea that we're
holding out on them, they'll sour on us."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care if they did," said Lee, "but I suppose it's
important to you."</p>

<p>"Sure! Sure!" said Loasby seriously. "In a free country every
public official has to keep in with the press."</p>

<p>So the story was given out. But not the whole story. They took
care to omit all reference to Agnes Gartrey and her maid.</p>

<p>Lee gritted his teeth when he read it next morning. It put him
in a ridiculous light with the public. Wounded thus in his
professional pride, he hardened his heart anew against the
beguiling Al Yohe. I'm going to bring him in, he vowed to
himself, if I have to do it singlehanded!</p>

<p>Fanny and Judy received him demurely at the office. Neither of
them made any reference to the story in the newspapers; they were
waiting for Lee to speak about it. They fussed about him, with an
added affectionateness and care to carry out his wishes. Lee
would not speak about the newspaper story and that put the girls
in a false position. Finally, Fanny was obliged to say:</p>

<p>"Pop, dear, I was horrified to read about what happened last
night. I didn't like to speak of it because I thought it was a
painful subject."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Lee. "I enjoyed my visitor thoroughly!"</p>

<p>Fanny looked at him, not quite knowing how to take this.</p>

<p>Just as he was beginning to think about lunch, Lee, to his
astonishment, saw Robert Hawkins entering the outer office. The
old man was greatly agitated. Fanny brought him into the private
office. Hawkins took care to shut the door before stating his
errand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, sir, an extraordinary thing has happened. It
scares me, sir. I don't know what to make of it. I took the first
train to New York to consult with you, sir."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Hawkins produced an envelope and from it drew a credit note
bearing the heading of the Girard National Bank. His hand
trembled. "On Saturday morning, sir, somebody deposited five
thousand dollars to my credit in the bank. My first knowledge of
it was when I received this credit note in the mail this
morning."</p>

<p>Lee, studying him, thought: If he has learned about my visit
to the bank, this is exactly what a clever crook would do. He
said: "You have no idea who it was?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! Who would give me five thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"It does seem odd, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars! It's a fortune! After a lifetime of
work I have only succeeded in saving half that sum!"</p>

<p>If the old man's astonishment and consternation were faked, it
was a good piece of acting. Lee made believe to take his story at
face value. "Hawkins," he said, "this is an attempt to implicate
you in the Gartrey murder!"</p>

<p>"That is what I feared, sir! What a blackguardly trick to play
on an innocent man!"</p>

<p>"You have been to the bank?" asked Lee casually.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! I was waiting when they opened their doors this
morning. I asked if there wasn't some mistake, but they said no;
the amount had been paid in in cash on Saturday morning."</p>

<p>"Whom did you see at the bank?"</p>

<p>"One of the vice presidents, sir, and he sent for the teller
who had received the money."</p>

<p>Lee would have liked to know if the bank people had told
Hawkins of his visit on Saturday. He did not put the question,
for that would have been to show his hand. "Did the teller
describe the man who deposited the money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A handsome, fashionable young man. That suggested nothing to
me, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Hawkins," said Lee affably, "you did right in coming
direct to me. It was without a doubt the actual murderer who had
the money conveyed to you. Five thousand dollars is a biggish
sum; it ought not to be too hard to trace it. This may lead us to
the man we want."</p>

<p>"I pray that it may, sir!"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I don't suppose you want to use the money."</p>

<p>"Use it!" cried the old man in horror. "I wouldn't touch it
with a pair of tongs!"</p>

<p>"Then I suggest that you make out a check to the order of the
Police Commissioner to be held by him until the mystery is
cleared up."</p>

<p>"I'll do that, sir. I have my checkbook with me. I'll leave
the check with you."</p>

<p>"Good! That will clear your skirts."</p>

<p>Hawkins produced his checkbook and, drawing up a chair to
Lee's desk, proceeded to write the check. Lee watched him
steadily. It was a vast sum to an old man who had worked for
wages all his life. If he felt any reluctance to hand it over, he
hid it well. Handing over the check, he asked with an innocent
air: "What should I do now, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go back to Philadelphia and act as if nothing had happened.
Tell nobody about your windfall. We don't want the man we're
looking for to take alarm."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone, Lee got Loasby on the wire. "The man
you assigned to watch Robert Hawkins," he said; "can you depend
on him?"</p>

<p>Loasby chuckled. "I reckon so. He followed Hawkins to the bank
this morning, rode to New York on the train with him and tailed
him to your office. My man was waiting in a store across the
street while Hawkins was with you, and he phoned me from
there."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lee. "As an extra precaution, notify the
bank in Philadelphia that if Hawkins should try to draw out more
than the sum he deposited himself, he is to be detained for
questioning."</p>

<p>"Right! What's up, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming down to your office after lunch. I'll explain when
I see you."</p>

<p>At Headquarters, when Lee had described the scene with Hawkins
to Loasby, the latter said: "What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"There are three possibilities," said Lee. He ticked them off
on his fingers: "First, Al Yohe is the murderer and is trying to
throw suspicion on Hawkins. Judging from what he told me, Al is
well heeled. Second, Agnes Gartrey had the money conveyed to
Hawkins to bolster up her suggestion that the butler is the
guilty man. There are two sub-theories here: (a) it was Agnes
herself who shot Gartrey, or (b) she believes that Al Yohe did
it. Third, Hawkins shot Gartrey and the five thousand is his pay,
or part of it. We have got to follow up all these lines
simultaneously until they are disproved or proved."</p>

<p>"Right. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"You have men who are experienced in Wall Street affairs
investigating Gartrey's business relations?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Well, let them dig deeper. We've got to know who Gartrey had
injured, who were his enemies, who profited by his death."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>"Here's something else you can do. Suppose for the moment that
old Hawkins is telling the truth. Suppose Mrs. G. sent the money
to Philadelphia. There are two men who have been trying to make
time with her since this happened. One of them, Alan Barry Deane,
we know has been lying. Arrange it so that the bank teller can
have a look at Deane and at Rulon Innes without their knowing
it."</p>

<p>"I'll do that. What line are you going to take?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to cultivate the acquaintance of the beautiful
widow," said Lee with a smile.</p>

<p>"What about Al Yohe?"</p>

<p>"I was hoping you might be able to give me some news about
him."</p>

<p>Loasby shook his head gloomily. "In addition to my own men
every uniformed cop on the force is looking for him. No
reports."</p>

<p>"I'm going down to Hasbroucks from here," said Lee. "There are
several questions which I have no right to ask there, but the
police are entitled to the information."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Get Mr. Gartrey's private secretary. Find out from her if
Gartrey got a phone call on November 3rd before he went home, and
so on."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it," said Loasby.</p>

<p>Lee proceeded further downtown to the offices of Hasbrouck and
Company in the great building on Wall Street which bore their
name. Hasbroucks, oldest and wealthiest private bankers in New
York, was a name to conjure with in financial circles. None of
the present generation of Hasbroucks was in the bank; one was an
artist; one raised race horses; a third was simply an ornament to
Newport and Palm Beach. For upwards of ten years Jules Gartrey
had been president of the concern. On the day following his
death, at a special meeting of the directors, George Coler, first
vice president, had been elected president in Gartrey's stead.
Everybody took it as a matter of course that Coler should succeed
the man who had trained him.</p>

<p>The executive offices were on the top floor of the skyscraper.
Lee, whose first visit it was, looked around him appreciatively;
he enjoyed quality wherever he found it. Here, the lofty
ceilings, the walls paneled with rare woods, the thick-piled rugs
caressing the feet, expressed the highest quality without any
suggestion of showiness. And space, plenty of space, the greatest
luxury of all. This was a thoroughly modern office. The handsome
young clerks and the beautiful secretaries moved through the
rooms smiling, stopping to converse with each other cheerfully in
order to show that there was no slave-driving here. Lee was
particularly struck with the charming manners of the lovely
receptionist at her desk. She smiled at him confidently as one
nice person to another.</p>

<p>"You wish to see Mr. Coler? Have you an appointment, sir?"</p>

<p>Lee was obliged to confess that he had not.</p>

<p>Her face fell. "Oh, I'm so sorry! It is difficult to arrange a
meeting on the spur of the moment. But I'll see what I can do.
'What name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin. Amos Lee Mappin."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened. "Mr. Mappin! Oh, sir, I know Mr. Coler will
want to see you. Please be seated for a moment." She swam
away.</p>

<p>In no time at all she returned. "Mr. Coler will be delighted
to see you, Mr. Mappin. Please come this way."</p>

<p>Lee was led through one magnificent room after another, where
smiling employees worked at their desks or conversed happily
together. "This cannot be a bank," said Lee to his beautiful
conductress; "it is more like Heaven!"</p>

<p>She giggled politely, but it was evident she did not quite get
it. Arriving at last at the holy of holies, the corner office,
she announced: "Mr. Mappin," and disappeared. The door was
ostentatiously left open.</p>

<p>Lee received an impression of an acre of rare Kermanshah rug,
tulip wood panels, a beamed, polychrome ceiling. From behind a
gigantic desk with a whole brigade of telephones on it, George
Coler was rising to greet him. Coler was in perfect keeping with
the rich, conservative apartment; well groomed, handsome, smiling
and natural; indubitably one of Wall Street's aristocrats.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin! This is an unexpected pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, if I'm interrupting you," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Not at all! I am always at your service. Sit down, sir!"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lee dryly. "I am a little overwhelmed." He took
in all the details of the room.</p>

<p>Coler laughed pleasantly. "Silly, isn't it?" he said, waving
his hand about. "But, of course, a bit of swank is expected of
Hasbroucks."</p>

<p>"I like swank," said Lee.</p>

<p>A shadow passed over Coler's face. "I have been promoted to
the highest seat here," he said. "But how gladly I would give it
up if I could have my friend back!"</p>

<p>"I feel for you," said Lee.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?" asked
Coler.</p>

<p>"You have read this morning's paper, I take it," said Lee.</p>

<p>A frown distorted Coler's handsome face; he struck his fist on
the desk. "I have!" he cried, "and it is disgraceful that such a
thing could happen! And I looked on the fellow as my friend, Mr.
Mappin. I've been seeing a lot of him lately. His impudence
passes all bearing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you have got the wrong impression," said Lee. "Yohe's
manners were most agreeable. I quite enjoyed his visit."</p>

<p>Coler wouldn't have it. "Disgraceful!" he repeated. "That a
murderer should be able to thumb his nose at decent folk like
that. What is the matter with our police?"</p>

<p>"Obviously, somebody is concealing Yohe," said Lee. "The
police are up against it."</p>

<p>"If I was at the head of the force I would get something
done!"</p>

<p>"Naturally, Yohe's visit to me was a kind of challenge," Lee
went on, "and I have engaged myself to help the police in this
case."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Coler. "Then we'll get results. How can I help
you, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Coler," Lee said blandly, "the rumor persists that it is
Mrs. Gartrey who is keeping him hidden."</p>

<p>Coler leaned toward Lee. "Mappin, there is nothing in it! I am
with her part of every day&mdash;she depends on me for
everything, you see, and I know what I am talking about. Mind
you, I'm not saying that she wouldn't assist him; I will be very
frank with you; there is an infatuation there that it grieves me
to see. One can only hope that she may get over it quickly. But I
know from her uncertainty, her anxiety, her desire to get some
word of him, that she does not know where he is."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you're right," said Lee, "but I must
investigate this rumor along with everything else, just as a
matter of routine."</p>

<p>Coler said: "Apart from assuring you that there's nothing in
it, I don't see how I can help you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can." Lee had come to the point he had been leading
up to. "If there is any connection between Mrs. Gartrey and Yohe,
she may be supplying him with money. I want to check her
expenditures during the past week. Have you paid her any large
sums?"</p>

<p>"From the estate, do you mean? Not a penny. Mr. Gartrey died
intestate. She'll get the estate eventually, of course, but not
until the preliminaries are settled."</p>

<p>"Intestate? You shock me! A man of his wealth?"</p>

<p>"It seems that he had lately destroyed his last will and had
procrastinated in making another."</p>

<p>"Have you made payments to Mrs. Gartrey from other
sources?"</p>

<p>"No. She doesn't require it. Besides having credit everywhere,
she has a fortune of her own. Gartrey settled money on her when
she married him."</p>

<p>"Does she bank here?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Coler laughed. "No indeed! She wouldn't have her account in a
place where her husband could overlook it. She banks with the
Fulton National."</p>

<p>"Has she more than one account?"</p>

<p>"Only the one account."</p>

<p>"Let me see, who is President of the Fulton?"</p>

<p>"Canby Griffiths."</p>

<p>"Will you give me a note to Mr. Griffiths that will smooth my
way?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not," said Coler with his engaging frankness,
"because it would look as if I were going behind Agnes' back. You
don't need any note from me. Your name is a sufficient password
anywhere in town."</p>

<p>When Lee arose, Coler accompanied him to the outer office.
"I'm so glad you came in. We must keep in touch with each other.
Our interests are the same. If money is needed for the
prosecution of the case, you may call on me for any amount."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Coler. It won't be necessary for the
present."</p>

<p>Coler opened a door exhibiting another handsome office only
less grand than the one they had left. "My former office," he
said.</p>

<p>It had the same collection of telephones. "Why does a banker
need so many telephones?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Well, there's the inter-office phone, the connection with the
regular switchboard, a connection with the banking office
downstairs, a private wire to the Stock Exchange, my own personal
telephone, and so on."</p>

<p>As they shook hands at the outer door, Coler said: "Dine with
me some night, will you? So we can go into things more
particularly."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to," said Lee.</p>

<p><br> Lee Mappin's name proved to be sufficient to pass him
into the private office of the President of the Fulton National.
Mr. Griffiths was so anxious to help Lee, and so impressed with
the necessity of keeping the matter secret, that he went himself
to consult the book which contained Mrs. Gartrey's checking
account. The result, as far as Lee was concerned, was nil. Mr.
Griffiths said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey's balance as of yesterday was $113,000. She has
made no withdrawals this past week. She hasn't visited the bank.
All the checks that have been paid on her account were dated
previous to the tragedy. I expect she has been too prostrated
since to attend to any business."</p>

<p>"I expect so," said Lee dryly. "Anyhow, thank you very
much."</p>

<p><br> On his way uptown in a taxi, Lee read the latest extra on
the Al Yohe case. Every edition of the newspapers furnished an
avid public with added details of Al's spectacular life; his love
affairs, his wardrobe, his tastes in food and wine. Al had a
passion for fresh caviar, Lee read, and it made him thoughtful.
Fresh caviar had become a scarce article since the war, and
scandalously expensive. It ought not to be too difficult to
discover who still had a stock of the delicacy and to trace the
sales during the past week. Al's present host, whoever he was,
might try to procure some. It was a faint lead, but worth
following up.</p>

<p>Lee stopped at the office of Stan Oberry, a private
investigator whom he had employed with success in former cases,
and put the matter in his hands. "Fresh Beluga caviar is the
choicest sort," said Lee. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was now that hour of the afternoon when a
gentleman might properly call on a lady, and Lee drove on uptown
to the Gartrey apartment. The door was opened to him by a
manservant he had not seen before, a dark young fellow, handsome
in the face and shapely of limb. His eyes, however, were too
close together; it gave him a foxy look.</p>

<p>"Are you Denman?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir. Mrs. Gartrey said you might wish to
question me."</p>

<p>Lee thought: The deuce you say! I'm sorry I didn't get hold of
you before she did.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey said I was to give you every assistance I
could," added Denman.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lee. "I understand that you were out of the
house when the tragedy occurred."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Hawkins, the butler, had given me leave to take
my watch to be repaired."</p>

<p>"Where did you take it? You understand, this is merely a
formal question."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite, sir. It's all right with me. I have nothing to
hide. I took my watch to a jeweler called Lohmeyer on West
Thirty-fourth Street, and waited for it while he put in a new
escapement."</p>

<p>"What time did you get back here?"</p>

<p>"It would be about half past four, sir."</p>

<p>"What did you find here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it was terrible. The master was still lying where he
had fallen! The place was full of police, medical examiners,
fingerprint men, photographers, I couldn't tell you who all. And
the maids hysterical and all!"</p>

<p>"Your mistress?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see her, sir. She was in her room under care of the
doctor."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Coler told me to stand at the service door and keep
everybody out. Mr. Coler had taken charge of everything. Mr.
Hawkins was minding the front door. Many people were trying to
get into the apartment. Seems people have no shame at such a
time."</p>

<p>"What is your theory as to what happened?" Lee asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>Denman was startled. "Oh, sir, how should I know what
happened? I wasn't here. Some of the servants seem to think it
was Mr. Hawkins did it, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that.
I am only an underservant; I don't know anything."</p>

<p>Lee shrugged and let it go at that. The young man's manners
were perfect, but somehow he left a bad taste in the mouth; he
was too smooth, too watchful. Lee made a mental note to check his
story with the watchmaker. "Can I see Mrs. Gartrey?" he asked.
"I'll see, sir."</p>

<p>Lee was shown into the music room, which lay between the vast
living room on one side and Agnes' boudoir on the other. In order
to reach it he had to step over the spot where Jules Gartrey's
dead body had lain on the parquet. Denman betrayed no
consciousness of recent tragedy. The windows of the music room
looked out on the familiar panorama of the park with its leafless
trees, the East Drive, the reservoir beyond, the towers of
Central Park West in the distance.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short space of time, the door from the
boudoir was thrown open and Agnes Gartrey appeared, holding out
both her hands. Lee thought: Hm! I appear to be welcome.
Meanwhile Denman had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin!" Agnes cried breathlessly; "this is like the
answer to a prayer! Oh, I wanted so to see you! An hour ago I
could stand it no longer and I called your office. They said you
were out, didn't know when you'd return. I didn't leave my name,
of course. And here you are! It is too good to be true. Come into
the boudoir. There's a fire and it's cosier!"</p>

<p>She led the way into the adjoining room. She was wearing a
kind of house gown with a lustrous black skirt that trailed on
the ground and a cerise waist. Lee watched to see how she avoided
walking up the front of the long skirt; there was art in the way
she kicked it out of the way with every step. She made an
extraordinarily graceful picture. In the boudoir the curtains
were drawn together and a flattering rosy light filled the
room.</p>

<p>"Cigarette, Mr. Mappin? Shall I ring for tea? I'm sure you'd
rather have a highball, and so would I." Suddenly she dropped the
fine lady air and turned to him with a face all broken up and
working like a child's. Lee couldn't help but be moved, though he
told himself this was just art like everything else about
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, before I ring for the man, tell me about Al," she
murmured, clasping her hands. "How does he look? Is he well? Who
is taking care of him? How is he bearing up under this frightful
charge?"</p>

<p>"He looks grand," said Lee dryly. "In the pink of condition.
Bubbling over with high spirits."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's just his line," she said quickly. "I expect in his
heart he is almost ready to despair!"</p>

<p>"If he is, he concealed it well."</p>

<p>"Where is he hidden? Who is taking care of him? Oh, I am sure
you know more than you told the newspapers!"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is," said Lee. "I wish I did."</p>

<p>"What was his purpose in coming to see you at such a
risk?"</p>

<p>"To protest that he was innocent; to ask me to prove his
innocence."</p>

<p>"And you will, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to work on the case," said Lee, "but I cannot
undertake to prove his innocence."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is innocent! He is! He is!"</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Lee demurely. "I took quite a fancy to the
fellow, confound him!"</p>

<p>"Did he send me any message?" Agnes asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"No," said Lee. "I am not in his confidence. He would hardly
send it by me."</p>

<p>"But he spoke of me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but guardedly."</p>

<p>She caught her breath. "Guardedly? He...he is not angry with
me?"</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, no!" said Lee; "only trying to protect your
good name."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gartrey paced the room. Her agitation had increased. Lee
began to perceive that it was not anxiety for Al Yohe which lay
at the bottom of it, but fear of what Al might have told him,
Lee. She said: "He told you, of course, that he was out of the
apartment before the shot was fired?"</p>

<p>Lee lied with the utmost blandness. "Yes, he told me
that."</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, her worst fears relieved. "You must be
dying for a drink!" she said, pressing a bell for the servant.
"Sit down, do!" She draped herself on a low chair beside the
fire, and resting elbow on knee cupped her chin in her palm, an
infinitely graceful pose. "Did he tell you that I sent him away
on Monday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No. He merely said that he left. I must tell you that we were
interrupted by my well-meaning neighbor before I had finished
questioning him. That's why I came to you this afternoon; to get
you to fill in the blanks."</p>

<p>She swallowed this whole. "You did right," she said with
restored complacence.</p>

<p>"You said you sent him away on Monday. Why?"</p>

<p>"I had an engagement."</p>

<p>Denman entered and was ordered to bring Scotch whisky, soda,
ice. His face was as expressionless as paper.</p>

<p>When he had gone out, Lee said: "You had an engagement Monday
afternoon&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"At Madame Helena Rubinstein's establishment. I don't know if
you have heard of it, but Madame Rubinstein possesses a marvelous
collection of antique doll's furniture. It is all arranged in
miniature rooms down both sides of a corridor, perfect in every
detail of each period, and beautifully lighted..."</p>

<p>"Marvelous, I'm sure," said Lee, "but we're getting away from
Mr. Yohe."</p>

<p>"Sorry. Madame Rubinstein had arranged to give a public view
of her collection on Monday in aid of Polish Relief and I had to
be there since I am on the Committee and..."</p>

<p>"Mr. Yohe left here at what hour?"</p>

<p>"About half past three. I couldn't tell you to the minute. My
maid ushered him out."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I went into my dressing room to change for the street. My
maid joined me there."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>Agnes bit her lip. "Wait a minute," she said. "Wait until we
get rid of the servant." When she heard Denman coming she turned
on her social chatter like a phonograph record, starting in the
middle."...perfectly fascinating, Mr. Mappin! There are Spanish
rooms, French rooms, American Colonial and English rooms of
different periods, each one complete even to the tiny china
utensils in the bedrooms. Madame has been collecting the
furnishings for years. They say that Robert Edmond Jones painted
the little interiors for her."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" said Lee.</p>

<p>The servant entered bearing a tray which he placed on a little
table beside his mistress.</p>

<p>"You needn't wait," she said.</p>

<p>When he had closed the door behind him, Lee said inquiringly:
"Well?"</p>

<p>She held up a delicate hand. "Let me mix the highballs first.
I always begin to tremble when I approach that moment in my
mind."</p>

<p>When she handed Lee his drink, he held it up. "To happier
days!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you're so kind and understanding!" she murmured
gratefully. After she had taken a swallow of her
highball&mdash;and a big swallow, Lee noted, she picked up her
story at the precise point where she had dropped it. "I was
dressing in there when I heard the shot." She put a hand over her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You ran out?" prompted Lee.</p>

<p>"Not immediately. I was paralyzed with terror. Nothing brutal
has ever been allowed to approach me, you know. I am spoiled. I
am no better than a hothouse plant. I couldn't move. And Eliza
was just as bad. We clung to each other. I picked up the house
phone then&mdash;the switchboard is in the servants' hall, but I
could get no answer, no answer! 'Eliza,' I said, 'we have got to
go and see!' It was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my
life!"</p>

<p>"You ran out together?"</p>

<p>"Yes..." She quickly corrected herself. "Not together. I ran
across this room and through the music room to the foyer. Eliza
went by the corridor."</p>

<p>"Why did you separate?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me! Neither of us knew what we were doing!"</p>

<p>"How long a time passed after the shot before you got out in
the foyer?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't answer that either. It seemed like ages."</p>

<p>"Well, say two or three minutes. And what did you find?"</p>

<p>She covered her face. "My husband lying on the floor...bullet
hole...gun...Hawkins kneeling beside him..."</p>

<p>"Was anybody else there?"</p>

<p>"The maids. Maybe they came afterwards. I don't remember."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I think I cried out: 'Pick him up! Pick him up!' It semed so
dreadful to see him lying there on the floor, an old man. And
Hawkins said: 'He is dead, Madam."</p>

<p>"What did Hawkins look like when he said it?"</p>

<p>"Look like? He looked like a butler. A butler's expression
never changes. If the house was blown to pieces he would say,
without changing his tone: 'Do you require anything more,
Madam?'"</p>

<p>Lee ironed out a smile; Agnes did not mean to be funny. "Were
you completely dressed when you ran out in the foyer?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No...yes...no...Why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Well, in Hawkins' story, he said..."</p>

<p>"That I was fully dressed. I see. And it would have been
impossible, of course, for me to make a complete change in five
minutes. You had better disregard Hawkins' story entirely..."</p>

<p>"But the other servants also..."</p>

<p>"I had my suit skirt on when the shot was fired. Before I ran
out I put on the jacket of my suit, so I had the appearance of
being completely dressed."</p>

<p>"The jacket was buttoned, I assume."</p>

<p>"How can I be expected to remember such a detail as that?"</p>

<p>"What did you have on beneath the jacket, Mrs. Gartrey?"</p>

<p>She hardened. "Why do you ask me that question?"</p>

<p>"A man like Hawkins might easily have been mistaken, but it
seems strange that the maids should have testified that you were
fully dressed. Including your own maid, Eliza."</p>

<p>Agnes changed color under her make-up. She was breathing
quickly. "Are you intimating that I have not been telling the
truth?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Lee looked shocked. "My dear Mrs. Gartrey! I never dreamed of
such a thing!"</p>

<p>She was not satisfied. Her lips had drawn back in an ugly
fashion. "When Al, Mr. Yohe, told you that he was innocent, did
he express any opinion as to who had shot my husband?"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "The poor fellow was all at sea. That is
why he insists on remaining in hiding."</p>

<p>"Did he...did he by any chance suggest that I might have had a
hand in it?"</p>

<p>Lee deliberately paused a moment before answering. "He did
not."</p>

<p>"Oh, God, what perfidy!" she breathed.</p>

<p>"My dear lady!" Lee assured her, "you are disturbed without
cause. Al Yohe never said a word that would lead me to suppose
such a thing. On the contrary, his thought was all of you...I am
merely trying to get a clear picture of what happened...If you
did not start to dress until after he left, how <i>could</i> you
have been fully dressed a moment or two after the shot was
fired?"</p>

<p>"I was not completely dressed," she said sullenly. "For an
obvious reason my servants were not telling the truth. They
wished to protect my good name."</p>

<p>Lee struck his forehead. "Of course! How stupid of me not to
have perceived that at once!"</p>

<p>She drank off the rest of her highball. Slowly she recovered
her self-possession. "You must have patience with me," she said
with a return of her caressing manner. "My nerves are gone!
Sometimes I scarcely know what I am saying!"</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Lee soothingly. "I am so sorry that I have
to trouble you at such a time."</p>

<p>"Such a charge could never touch me!" she said with proud
confidence.</p>

<p>Lee was reminded of something Al Yohe had said the night
before.</p>

<p>"And if it should be brought, it would fall," Agnes continued,
"because at the moment the shot was fired my maid and I were
together."</p>

<p>Lee inwardly resolved to talk to Eliza Young without the
knowledge of her mistress.</p>

<p>He rose and opened the door into the corridor. "I am trying to
fix the layout of this building in my mind," he explained
deprecatingly. "On the other side of the corridor wall must be
the public hall and passenger elevator."</p>

<p>"That's right," she said carelessly. "Will you have another
drink?"</p>

<p>"No more, thank you." Lee returned to his chair leaving the
door open. "What did you and Mr. Yohe talk about while he was
here?"</p>

<p>Again suspicion made her eyes narrow. "Didn't you ask him that
question?" she countered.</p>

<p>"I did ask him," said Lee with an innocent air, "and his
answer was evasive. That made me think that perhaps it had some
bearing on what happened later."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," she said. "Our talk was completely
unimportant&mdash;so unimportant that it has passed out of my
mind...I suppose we talked about the Polish Relief Ball in which
we are both interested. We discussed mutual friends&mdash;just
such talk, in fact, as you would expect between old friends."</p>

<p>Lee thought: That is a little too good to be true, my
lady.</p>

<p>While he sat with her he heard from the other side of the
corridor wall a slight rumble and, after a pause, a click.
Insignificant sounds, but unmistakable to apartment dwellers. It
was the elevator door opening and closing again. It was important
to Lee to know that these sounds could be heard from where he
sat. Either Al Yohe or Agnes Gartrey could have had warning that
Gartrey was about to return. Lee heard the distant sound of the
doorbell.</p>

<p>"Bother!" said Agnes with an intimate smile. "I hope we're not
going to be interrupted."</p>

<p>"Well, I've told you all I know," said Lee. "Have you anything
more to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so stupid, Mr. Mappin. I don't know what are the
important things. You must question me."</p>

<p>"Can't think of any more questions now. But we'll meet
again."</p>

<p>"We must."</p>

<p>The manservant entered. "Mr. Coler, Madam." Lee felt a little
uneasy. It might be difficult to explain this visit.</p>

<p>Agnes said: "I'll see him directly. Did you show him into the
living room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam."</p>

<p>"Did you close the door?"</p>

<p>"I...I think so, Madam."</p>

<p>"That means you didn't," she said sharply. "Close it on your
way out. How many times must I tell you to close doors, all
doors!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam." He went out.</p>

<p>"It's just as well not to advertise the fact that you and I
are friends," Agnes said to Lee. Agnes was keeping certain things
from Coler, then. Lee was relieved and also a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"Quite!" he said. He got to his feet. "There's just one thing
that bothers me. I'm not sure how Al is fixed for money. If I
should find out that..."</p>

<p>She didn't wait for him to finish. "Oh, you must come to me
for anything that may be needed!" she said eagerly. "Shall I give
it to you now?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know how to reach him," said Lee. "But if he
communicates with me again..."</p>

<p>"If he does, you must find out how he is fixed for money. Make
him tell you. And call on me for any amount. You needn't tell him
it comes from me."</p>

<p>"It would be dangerous for you to draw a check to me,"
suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"I don't need to! I always keep a store of cash by me, quite a
large sum. Always have done so. Checkbooks are apt to be
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Lee.</p>

<p>They laughed together agreeably&mdash;but not for the same
reason.</p>

<p>"If you hear from him again, beg him to communicate with me,"
she said longingly.</p>

<p>It had the sound of a genuine plea.</p>

<p>He went out thinking over all she had said. It did not hang
together at all. She was acting alternately as if she adored Al
Yohe and as if she hated him poisonously. Lee thought: Hell
knoweth no fury like a woman scorned! </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">ON Tuesday morning, as Lee got out of a taxicab
in front of the little building on Madison Avenue which contained
his offices, he was accosted by a breathless woman:</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin...if you please...I recognized you from your
picture in the newspaper...may I speak to you?"</p>

<p>Lee sized her up. While extremely agitated, her aspect was not
at all dangerous; a stout woman of fifty-odd, with a plain, pale
face; well dressed in a sober style; no make-up, no effort to
appear younger than she was. She never had been beautiful, but
she looked honest, well meaning, sensitive in her distress.
Obviously, it had required a great effort for her to nerve
herself up to speak to a strange man.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I have some information about the Gartrey case."</p>

<p>"Won't you come into my office?"</p>

<p>"I intended to call at your office," she stammered, "but...but
my courage failed me. There will be other people there...clerks,
perhaps newspaper reporters. If I could see you alone!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a hotel on the next corner," said Lee. "Let us
go in there and order a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>She thanked him gratefully.</p>

<p>They sat down in the coffee room of the hotel with a little
table between them. Lee made conversation to put the nervous
woman at her ease. Her faded eyes had a good, kind expression; he
believed in her honesty.</p>

<p>"My name is Bertha Cressy, Mrs. Cressy," she said. "I have
been a widow for over twenty years. I was a friend of the late
Mr. Gartrey's." She hesitated painfully.</p>

<p>"How long have you known Mr. Gartrey?" asked Lee to help her
out.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin," she said distressfully, "will you give me your
word that you will keep what I am about to tell you to yourself?
I could not bear to have it printed in the newspapers. I have a
horror of publicity. If the newspaper reporters found me out,
I...I don't know what I'd do!"</p>

<p>"I certainly will not relay your story to the newspapers,"
said Lee kindly, "but how can I give you the assurance that you
require? If you have evidence to give in this case it must be
brought into court."</p>

<p>"I have no evidence to give," she said. "I don't know who
killed Jules Gartrey. I only want to see justice done to my dead
friend. The newspapers are making him out a perfect monster! He
was kind to me. It seems so unfair!"</p>

<p>"The newspapers do that sort of thing in order to heighten
interest in the case," said Lee. "It sometimes makes me
indignant, too. Unless there is something in your story that
requires to be told in court, I promise you I will keep what you
tell me to myself."</p>

<p>She thanked him profusely. "I have known Mr. Gartrey from the
time of his first marriage, but not intimately," she said. "That
is thirty years ago. I was a girlhood friend of his first wife,
Mona Hawley. We were schoolmates and we continued to be friends
until she died eleven years ago. Long before that, the death of
my husband had left me in very straitened circumstances and Mona
helped me out, in fact she supported me. Her husband knew nothing
about it, and when she died it ceased. I didn't see Mr. Gartrey
for some time after that. A year after Mona's death he married
for the second time. Do you know about that?"</p>

<p>"Only that it turned out badly," said Lee. "There was an ugly
scandal of some sort."</p>

<p>"Yes. I wouldn't pretend that Jules was an easy man to get
along with, but he was far from being the cold and selfish being
that the newspapers make out. Sometimes while my friend was alive
it made me angry to see the way he treated her. But Mona never
complained. You see, she had fallen in love with him as a young
man, before he became rich. She always saw him in that light. His
second wife was a young actress&mdash;not that I have anything
against actresses, but this one was a badhearted woman. She
married him for his money and repented of her bargain. She was a
flaunting, conspicuous creature, always getting in the
newspapers, and she made Jules, who hated that sort of thing,
very unhappy.</p>

<p>"It was at this time that he looked me up. I was working as a
saleswoman in a department store; poor pay and very hard work for
a woman of my age. You can imagine my surprise when the rich man
came to my shabby little furnished room. He had found some of my
old letters to Mona, he said, and after reading them was
convinced that Mona and I were the only good women he had ever
known. He said it was not fitting that a friend of his dead
wife's should be living in such poverty, and he arranged to have
an annuity paid me that enabled me to give up my job and live in
modest comfort ever since. What an act of kindness! To lift the
awful dread of insecurity from my breast forever! I could never
sufficiently express my gratitude.</p>

<p>"In my new home he came to see me regularly. It relieved his
breast to talk to me about Mona and to confide in me how the
other woman wounded him in his pride. There soon began to be talk
of other men in her life. I don't need to go into detail about
that; it is long past. Matters went from bad to worse with his
marriage; he finally paid the woman an immense sum of money and
she went to Reno and got a divorce. So far, that was all right,
but when she returned to New York, out of pure malevolence she
made a statement to the newspapers that almost wrecked my poor
friend."</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressy blushed slightly. "Don't ask me to repeat it in
detail. A coarse and shameless woman! She had his money and she
had her divorce and she didn't care what she said. I only mention
this to enable you to understand what happened later. What she
said reflected on Mr. Gartrey's manhood; she intimated
that...that he had never been a real husband to her. He was a
proud man. There was nothing he could do but suffer in silence.
Only I knew what he suffered. The wound that that woman dealt to
his pride never healed.</p>

<p>"Six years ago he married for the third time. I was not
consulted in advance or I might have warned him&mdash;but I don't
suppose it would have made any difference if I had. His new wife
was a young girl living on the island of Barbados. He met her
while he was cruising in the West Indies on his yacht. Her father
was a clergyman; she had never been away from the little colony;
she was innocent, simple, unsophisticated, and as beautiful as an
angel. He thought she would make him an ideal wife; he thought
when he introduced her to the great world it would be like
fairyland to her and he the Prince Charming.</p>

<p>"Of course, it didn't turn out like that. He made the initial
mistake of settling a million dollars on her at the time of their
marriage, so that from the beginning she had an independent
income of forty thousand dollars a year. She was corrupted by
luxury; her beauty made her famous and her whole character
altered. It was the story of his second marriage over again, but
this time he suffered worse and for a longer time.</p>

<p>"Gradually he learned that she was unfaithful to him, though
he had no legal proof of it. And she knew that he knew; she
didn't care because she believed that he would put up with
anything rather than face a second scandal. When they were alone
together she was completely cynical; she twitted him with his
advancing age. She made his life a hell on earth but he was a
proud man and he never let the world guess it. As before, I was
his confidante. I don't think anybody else ever knew except
possibly Mr. George Coler, who was his closest male friend.</p>

<p>"Finally, like the other one, Agnes Gartrey offered to go to
Reno to divorce him, but she demanded such an enormous settlement
that he refused. He could not bear, he said, after having given
her one fortune to reward her unfaithfulness with another. He
made up his mind that if there had to be a second scandal this
one should not be at his expense. He was preparing to divorce her
on statutory grounds here in New York State. Then he would not
have to give her a penny. His suspicions settled on Alastair
Yohe, the society photographer, and a precious young
scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him?" put in Lee.</p>

<p>"No! And I have no wish to!...In order to further the affair,
Mr. Gartrey made friends with Yohe and even lent him a large sum
of money to refurnish his night club. Mr. Gartrey engaged private
detectives to watch the couple, but nothing came of that. He then
arranged with one of his own menservants to inform him by
telephone when Yohe came to the house. I assume that it was such
a message which took him home so early on the afternoon he was
killed."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that," said Lee.</p>

<p>"That is my story," said Mrs. Cressy. "About a month ago, when
Mr. Gartrey was in my apartment, he tore up the will he had made
in the woman's favor and burned the pieces. At that time he
wanted to make a will leaving me a great sum of money, but I
protested against it. He put off making another will and now, I
suppose, she will inherit his fortune anyhow."</p>

<p>"Certainly the greater part of it," said Lee. "Unless she
should be convicted of his murder."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressy's eyes widened. "Do you think...do you think?..."
she stammered.</p>

<p>"Ah, that I can't say," said Lee. "All the evidence so far
appears to point to the young man."</p>

<p>"I've told you the story for your own information," said Mrs.
Cressy. "I am not a revengeful woman, but I should like to see
her punished. Even if it was the young man who fired the shot,
morally she is just as guilty as he."</p>

<p>"So it would seem," said Lee. "I am exceedingly obliged to
you, Mrs. Cressy. You have thrown much light on a dark subject. I
shall respect your confidence." </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">LATER in the morning, Lee and Inspector Loasby
were in conference at Headquarters. Loasby said:</p>

<p>"Yesterday I asked Jules Gartrey's personal secretary to come
and see me, and she stopped in after office hours. A beautiful
girl, and very intelligent; name of Coulson. She said that Mr.
Gartrey had received a message over his personal telephone on the
afternoon of the third&mdash;she was in his office at the time,
and it threw him into considerable agitation. This was at three
o'clock. He sent for Mr. Coler, but word came back that Mr. Coler
was not in his office. Mr. Gartrey then went home without a word
to anybody and was never seen again at his office. It looks as if
he had been lured to his death, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Lee.</p>

<p>The Inspector had another piece of information to impart. "I
asked Mr. Alan Barry Deane to come down this morning on the
pretext that I wanted to question him further in respect to the
visit that he said Al Yohe had made to his apartment on the
afternoon of the murder. I had the receiving teller of the Girard
National Bank in the building, and I arranged that he was to come
into my office while I was talking to Deane and lay some papers
on my desk. After Deane had gone, the bank teller positively
identified him as the man who had deposited five thousand dollars
to the credit of Robert Hawkins. What do you think about
that?"</p>

<p>"It does not surprise me," said Lee. "We are dealing with
amateur plotters here."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it gets us much farther forward," said
Loasby. "There is no charge that I could bring against
Deane."</p>

<p>"Let it go for the moment," said Lee. "Deane is of no
importance as compared with the woman who sent him to
Philadelphia. The fame of a beautiful woman is apt to obscure the
fact that she is a fool. This foolish woman is almost certain to
bring disaster on herself and everybody connected with her before
we are through."</p>

<p>Loasby was very glum; criticism in the press had risen to such
a point that the Mayor had talked to the Commissioner of Police
about it. Loasby feared for his job. Lee's conscience was
troubling him sorely, for he possessed a clue that would very
much have simplified Loasby's search for the elusive Al Yohe.
Having suppressed it in the beginning, Lee could not very well
bring it forward now&mdash;at least not openly. He determined to
feed the information to Loasby by degrees.</p>

<p>Loasby was saying: "The Stieff Building where Al had an
apartment is on Fifth Avenue near the Plaza. Stieff's store is at
street level. It's a small building but the rents are very high
because of the choice address. Al's flat consists of kitchen,
dinette, living room, bedroom and bath. He has set up a portable
dark room in the dinette. The building furnishes maid service to
the tenants and the maid told me that Al never slept there more
than two nights a week and sometimes not at all for a week
running. He never kept any food in the place except maybe a box
of biscuits or the like, but there was a whole closet full of
liquor. We broke into it. Nothing there but liquor, the most
expensive brands. We sealed it up again.</p>

<p>"The elevator and the hall boys told me that Al worked at his
photography in the place. He had many visitors day and night.
Sometimes they made so much noise at night the other tenants
complained. After all his visitors had gone, though it might be
three or four in the morning, Al would change into his day
clothes and go out whistling. Wouldn't return until late the next
day. Was never there week ends, yet he didn't take a bag when he
started out."</p>

<p>"What does this picture suggest to you?" asked Lee. "Why, that
he had another hangout, and a woman waiting for him. It is she
who is hiding him now."</p>

<p>"Obviously."</p>

<p>"If I only had a description of that woman!"</p>

<p>"Let us look over the photographs that were found in his
place," suggested Lee.</p>

<p>Loasby sent for the photographs and they were presently put on
his desk. The prints were contained in hundreds of manila
envelopes filed alphabetically in two drawers. Al had generally
used a tiny Leica which could be carried in his pocket; also
there were many enlargements of the original negatives. Each
envelope was endorsed with the name of its subject and there was
a date on the back of each picture. Lee thumbed them over
rapidly. Many of the greatest names in New York were included. He
was surprised to find a picture of himself for he did not know
that he had ever been the object of Al Yohe's attentions. It had
been taken in La Sourabaya and made him look like a cross between
an underdone apple dumpling and a baldheaded owl. He showed it to
Loasby with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Let me destroy that," said Loasby scandalized.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Lee putting it back in its envelope. "It
adds to the gaiety of nations."</p>

<p>"Am I in there?" demanded the handsome Inspector
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"No," said Lee, "I have been through the Ls."</p>

<p>At the back of the second drawer he found a bulky envelope
without endorsement. He emptied the contents on the desk and went
over the scores of little prints one by one. These, as he had
hoped, proved to be the pictures Al had taken for his own
amusement; views of New York, street scenes, odd
characters&mdash;and the little wife!</p>

<p>"There's the girl," said Lee, tossing it over. "How can you be
so sure?" said Loasby.</p>

<p>"She's the only girl in the lot who is not named."</p>

<p>Loasby studied her through his magnifying glass. "She's
pretty," he said, "but so simple-looking. You wouldn't think Al
Yohe would fall for that after the queens he was accustomed
to."</p>

<p>"How little you know of human nature!" said Lee grinning.
"Here's another of her...and another."</p>

<p>"A sweet little thing," said Loasby.</p>

<p>Finally Lee found a prize; a picture of Charlotte pushing a
baby carriage. The baby unfortunately was asleep and did not
show. "Look at this one!" he cried. "Al Yohe is married to the
girl and they have a baby!"</p>

<p>"Your mind jumps to conclusions like a grasshopper!" grumbled
Loasby. However, he had a great respect for Lee's mind, and was
prepared to believe what he was told.</p>

<p>"Here's a picture of the baby," said Lee, tossing over another
print. "The spitting image of AL"</p>

<p>Loasby studied it. "Damned if I can see it."</p>

<p>"Examine the eyes. It's the way the upper lid is folded that
gives Al such a beguiling look, and the little fellow has it,
too."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's a boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you've had any experience of babies you can always
tell." Lee's conscience felt easier now because Loasby was in
possession of as much knowledge as he had himself; it was up to
him to use it.</p>

<p>Among the pictures Lee found one of Al himself that had been
enlarged. The young man was shown seated sideways on a wide
window sill silhouetted against the light. The house across the
street showed faintly in the background. Al's hair was gracefully
touseled, his shirt open at the throat. "Al at his ease in his
own place," Lee said, exhibiting it. "Let us see what this tells
us."</p>

<p>"There are millions of windows in New York," grumbled
Loasby.</p>

<p>"Not exactly like this window."</p>

<p>"It may not even be in New York."</p>

<p>"But it is New York. I'll prove that to you directly. Al would
never choose a suburban hide-out. The transit facilities are not
good enough at three or four o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"It might be Brooklyn."</p>

<p>"No. For Al to be continually taxiing over to Brooklyn in the
small hours would leave too broad a trail. Why should he waste
all that time when there are good places in Manhattan?" Lee went
over the pictures again and found two that represented the
interior of the same room without the inclusion of figures. The
first showed a bit of the same window; the second a side wall of
the room with a marble mantel. It was an old-fashioned room but
luxuriously furnished. There was a "steeple" clock on the mantel.
Lee spread the three pictures before him. "Now, we've got
something to go on!" he said.</p>

<p>Loasby grinned incredulously. "Do you actually think you can
locate that room from a study of the interior?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. For forty years it has been my principal diversion
to mosey around this town. I know it pretty well...Notice the
width of the window seat; ten or twelve inches; this house was
built in the days when walls were walls, in the late 1870's, say,
or the early 1880's. The style of the interior woodwork and the
mantel bears out the date. It is not a one-family house but a
flat; one of the walk-up flats which began to be built at that
period. It has a brownstone front..."</p>

<p>"The front doesn't show in the photographs."</p>

<p>"All the houses built for respectable people at that time had
brownstone fronts. This is obviously not a tenement house.
Tenement houses may be much older, of course."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's a flat, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"In a dwelling house they would never put in so elaborate a
mantel on the top floor."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! What do you mean, top floor?"</p>

<p>Lee explained patiently. "I know it by the house across the
street. Even at that distance the ground floor does not come into
the picture. Al's flat must be on the fourth or fifth story."</p>

<p>"Why not higher?"</p>

<p>"The walk-up flats of that period were not built any higher.
Elevator flats began to come in about 1888." Lee made a new study
of the photographs. "It would be natural for Al to rent a walk-up
flat," he continued, half to himself, "even if the little wife
had to carry the baby up and down stairs. If there were hall boys
or elevator boys the risk of their recognizing him would be too
great...An old house but well kept up; notice the parquet floor,
Loasby. Al has to pay a good rent for it because it is still in a
smart neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Are there any old houses in smart neighorhoods?"</p>

<p>"Surely. An old house will often be left standing next door to
a swanky apartment house to protect its light on that side."</p>

<p>Loasby came around the desk to study the pictures over Lee's
shoulder. "This house is on one of the wider streets," he said,
"judging by the distance of the house across the street."</p>

<p>"Right," said Lee, smiling.</p>

<p>"It might be West Fifty-seventh Street. That's one of the
widest streets and it has both old and new houses. Also
Seventh-ninth, Eighty-sixth and Ninety-sixth are all wide."</p>

<p>"They weren't built upon as early as 1880."</p>

<p>"Then let's go over and take a look through Fifty-seventh."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "This is a street running north and
south."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to Al's methodical habits. All these photographs of
the room are dated the same day, May 23rd. I am assuming that
they were taken about the same hour. Notice the clock on the
mantel; quarter to one. Now note that as Al sits sideways on the
window sill the sun is just coming around into his face. That's
why he placed himself in that position. Opposite his face the
window frame is in shadow. At one o'clock in the afternoon that
must be a window on the east side of a street running north and
south."</p>

<p>"My God!" murmured Loasby. After a moment he went on: "That
complicates the search because all the north and south avenues
are wider than the cross streets."</p>

<p>"Right, but not as wide as this one. Take a good look at the
picture, Loasby. Notice the distance of the house across the way.
There are only two north and south streets as wide as this
indicates; upper Broadway on the West side and Park Avenue on the
East."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Loasby excitedly. "But there's also the
Grand Concourse in the Bronx."</p>

<p>"A new street. It has no houses as old as this one...Upper
Broadway is out, too."</p>

<p>"Why?</p>

<p>"In the 1880's it was called the Boulevard and was lined with
country houses. It never had any buildings like this one."</p>

<p>"Then it's on Park Avenue!" said Loasby excitedly. Lee
smiled.</p>

<p>Loasby's face fell. "No, it won't do, Mr. Mappin." He rapped
the photograph. "You said yourself this was built for a middle-class
house. There were never any middle-class houses on Park
Avenue."</p>

<p>Lee took a pinch of snuff. "You forget, Loasby. Park Avenue
was not considered a desirable street in 1880. The top of the
railway tunnel was open and the locomotives filled the air with
smoke and sulphurous fumes. It was not until the railway was
electrified that Park Avenue began to grow exclusive."</p>

<p>"It's three miles long," said Loasby glumly. "Surely; but any
house built as long ago as 1880 will stick out like a sore
finger."</p>

<p>Loasby got up. "Well, let's put it to the test." He did not
sound hopeful.</p>

<p>"We mustn't use a car with police plates," said Lee. "I
suggest you order a convertible town car. With the top up we can
see without being seen as we drive through the streets."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were on their way. Loasby was in
civilian clothes. Deprived of his usual motorcycle escort with
blaring sirens, the chauffeur had to take his chance with the
traffic and the Inspector became very impatient at the slowness
of their progress. It was a long way uptown.</p>

<p>"By God! what a lot of imbecile drivers there are in the
streets!" he cried.</p>

<p>Lee smiled.</p>

<p>At Thirty-third Street Lee suggested that their chauffeur use
the motor tunnel. "We don't need to bother with this part of Park
Avenue. Murray Hill has always been fashionable; there were never
any middle-class flat houses. Let's begin on the other side of
Grand Central."</p>

<p>Issuing from the tunnel at Fortieth Street, they crossed the
viaduct, encircled Grand Central Station, and dove under the
arches of the New York Central Building beyond. Issuing at
Forty-sixth Street, the magnificent vista of Park Avenue stretched
away to the north before them. For the first few blocks the street was
built solid on both sides with palatial apartment houses, hotels,
and an occasional grand church. Above Fifty-ninth Street, relics
of the past began to appear between the modern buildings and the
chauffeur was instructed to slow up and keep as close as possible
to the curb.</p>

<p>Here and there Lee was able to point out an old building that
answered in a general way to what they were looking for, but not
exactly. Loasby began to get excited.</p>

<p>"There are things in New York you never see until they're
pointed out to you," he said sententiously.</p>

<p>They drove on slowly for a mile and a half further. Suddenly
Lee said with complete confidence, "There it is!"</p>

<p>He was pointing to a pair of old-fashioned flat houses with
brownstone fronts in the middle of the block between Eighty-seventh
and Eighty-eighth Streets. Obviously they had been left
standing to save the light of two huge modern apartment houses,
one on each corner. The old houses had neighborhood stores at the
street level. Though out of date, they were well kept up. It
could be seen by the curtains at the windows that well-to-do
people lived in them.</p>

<p>"How are you so sure it's one of these?" demanded Loasby.</p>

<p>"Look at the apartment house across the street. That's the
building in the background of the photograph."</p>

<p>Their chauffeur found a parking space at the curb. Loasby was
all keyed up now. "I might take a look at the names in the
vestibule," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Won't do you any good," said Lee calmly. "You certainly won't
find the name of Yohe there." He looked up and down the street.
"Judging from the number of babies I see, this is the fashionable
hour for their parade. If Mrs. Yohe has the baby out for an
airing, she'll be bringing him home presently to be fed."</p>

<p>They waited; Lee watching the sidewalk throng with a half
smile; Loasby chewing a cigar and fidgeting.</p>

<p>In the end, up at the corner Lee saw Charlotte coming. She was
pushing a folding gocart with the baby in it. He waited a moment,
savoring his triumph, then said very casually:</p>

<p>"Here she comes, Inspector."</p>

<p>Loasby's full blue eyes seemed to start from his head. "My
God, it's miraculous!"</p>

<p>Lee was helping himself to a pinch of snuff. "Elementary, my
dear Watson," he murmured.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was only talking to myself."</p>

<p>Charlotte, with the deft, assured movements of the young
mother, lifted little Alastair from the gocart and planted him on
the house step. She folded the cart, and picking up the baby,
seated him within her arm, took the handle of the cart in her
free hand, and disappeared within the house.</p>

<p>"What a sweet little mother!" murmured Loasby. "Seems a kind
of a shame!"</p>

<p>The words echoed in Lee's breast and all his feeling of
triumph faded.</p>

<p>Loasby was for clambering out of the car to follow Charlotte,
but Lee detained him with a hand on his arm. "Better wait a
minute. It is possible that Al may be following her, watching to
see if the coast is clear."</p>

<p>They waited. Al did not appear. "He's inside the house," said
Loasby excitedly. "He wouldn't dare show himself in the street by
day. By God, we have him!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I'll telephone for assistance and wait here until my men
come."</p>

<p>Lee sat in the car while Loasby disappeared in a cigar store
close at hand. In five minutes he returned, saying: "I made a few
discreet inquiries in the store. She calls herself Mrs. Matthews
and she lives on the top floor. There's only one apartment on a
floor. Her husband is not known in the store, but she buys cigars
for him."</p>

<p>Lee was profoundly depressed. "Well, I'll be leaving you," he
said. "There's nothing more that I can do."</p>

<p>Loasby was glad to see him go. Naturally he didn't want to
share the glory of this capture.</p>

<p>Lee, not caring to show himself at the office under the
circumstances, went home. He tried to do some work on his big
book, but found himself unable to shape a coherent sentence. The
expressionless Jermyn, who took in a good deal more than he
seemed to, tried to distract his master with a galantine and a
half bottle of Pouilly that he had in from the Colony, but Lee
had small appetite. With an unusual burst of confidence he
said:</p>

<p>"It's that damned Gartrey case, Jermyn! It's got under my
skin."</p>

<p>Jermyn said: "I quite understand, sir. For myself, I cannot
believe that Al Yohe is guilty."</p>

<p>"What reason have you for saying that?" Lee asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't go to set up my opinion against yours, sir.
But I'm all for the little mother and the baby."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Lee. "That's what makes the situation so
hellish!"</p>

<p>After lunch there was a telephone call. Jermyn presently came
to Lee, saying doubtfully: "It's a gentleman, sir. I do not know
the voice. Won't give his name, but says it's very important. Do
you care to take it?"</p>

<p>Lee eagerly picked up the instrument. He heard a fresh young
voice, strained with anxiety. "Mr. Map-pin? Do you know who this
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you," said Lee grimly.</p>

<p>"I'm in a jam, sir. I had to go out to attend to a piece of
business this morning. Before coming back to the house I always
call up Charlotte from a block or two away to make sure the coast
is clear. I called her up and she didn't answer, though I was
sure she was there because it was the baby's lunch time. After a
few minutes I called again and somebody took down the receiver
but said nothing. It makes me think the police must have stumbled
on our hide-out careful as I have been. They must be cleverer
than I gave them credit for."</p>

<p>Lee was conscious of a feeling of relief. After all, the
police had not yet taken Al. He said nothing about his own
knowledge of the situation. "What can I do?" he asked
noncommittally.</p>

<p>"If the police are there, poor little Charlotte must be nearly
out of her mind with fright and anxiety. She has nobody to turn
to. Tell her from me that..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Lee grimly interrupted. "If you give me a
message for Charlotte I must turn it over to the police."</p>

<p>There was a silence while Al presumably mastered his
disappointment and anger. He uttered no reproaches. "Well, that's
that!" he said. "But please tell Charlotte this for me&mdash;and
I don't care if the police overhear it; tell her that I have a
safe hide-out and I'm all right. Tell her to keep up a good heart
and carry on until I can find a safe way to communicate with
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can tell her that," said Lee.</p>

<p>A pleading note came into Al's voice. "And will you be
Charlotte's friend, Mr. Mappin? That won't commit you to
anything. God knows she's not to blame for what has
happened."</p>

<p>"I will be her friend so far as I am able," said Lee gravely.
"I wish to be your friend, too. You can't keep this up, Yohe. You
must face the situation."</p>

<p>"Not yet!" he said with the incorrigible break of laughter in
his voice. "Thanks for everything, Mr. Mappin." He hung up.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards there was a call from Loasby. In a grumbling
voice like a schoolboy's, he said: "He gave us the slip, Mr.
Mappin."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Lee dryly.</p>

<p>"Hey?" cried Loasby startled. "How did you know it?"</p>

<p>"He just called me up."</p>

<p>"The hell you say! What for?"</p>

<p>"To ask me to tell Charlotte that he was all right and not to
worry."</p>

<p>"Damned cheek!" growled Loasby. "By God, what pleasure it will
give me to attend the death chamber when he burns!"</p>

<p>Lee said nothing.</p>

<p>"I went to the apartment myself," Loasby resumed. "He was not
in it. Charlotte was frightened but I couldn't get a thing out of
her. You know the type. You could kill her by inches and she
wouldn't speak."</p>

<p>"I know," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I left a man there to wait for his return. The house is
watched front, rear and from the roof. My man has reported that
the telephone rang twice, but Charlotte refused to answer it. He
heard Al's voice on the wire. So I take it he's warned now, and
won't be back."</p>

<p>"Too bad!" Loasby couldn't see him grin.</p>

<p>"However," said Loasby, "at that we have separated him from
his hide-out; he is certain to be picked up within twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>Lee's grin widened. "Surely!" he said.</p>

<p>"I want to talk things over with you," said Loasby.</p>

<p>"Why not stop at my place on your way uptown?" suggested Lee.
"I had better not be seen around Headquarters too much or the
newspaper boys will have a rag baby."</p>

<p>"Right. I have to go to a banquet at the Ambassador. Expect me
about ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Very well. And look, Inspector; I recommend that you don't
let out a word about the flat on Park Avenue."</p>

<p>"Not a word! Not a word!" said Loasby fervently; and Lee knew
that he could depend upon it, since the story showed up the
handsome Inspector in a ludicrous light.</p>

<p>After these conversations, Lee felt a little better. He paced
up and down his living room smiling at his own discomfiture. Duty
points one way and inclination another, he thought. I have got to
break this case or it will break me! </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">LEE called up the Gartrey apartment. A
manservant answered. "I would like to speak to Miss Eliza Young,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>"What name, please?"</p>

<p>"Never mind my name. It's a personal matter." The voice
hesitated. "The servants do not use the phone for personal calls,
sir. Mrs. Gartrey's orders."</p>

<p>"It is rather important," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Hold the wire a moment, please. I will find out." After a
considerable wait Lee heard Agnes Gartrey's cold, crisp voice on
the wire. "What is it?" Smiling to himself, he quietly hung up.
She was always on guard!</p>

<p>At eight o'clock he called again. He figured that at this hour
Mrs. Gartrey would certainly be at dinner, and the manservant
presumably waiting on the table. Though he had obeyed orders, the
man had probably told Eliza of the call for her and she would be
on the <i>qui vive</i> for another. A female voice answered on
the wire.</p>

<p>"I would like to speak to Miss Eliza Young, please."</p>

<p>"This is she."</p>

<p>Lee smiled at his success. "This is Amos Lee Mappin
speaking,"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered eagerly.</p>

<p>"Can you speak freely, Eliza?"</p>

<p>She lowered her voice to a whisper. Evidently her lips were
close to the transmitter. "I'm speaking at the switchboard, sir.
So you can say what you like. But the other servants are in and
out of the pantry, here."</p>

<p>"I understand. I think you and I ought to have a talk, Eliza,
<i>privately</i>. There has been too much publicity."</p>

<p>"Indeed you're right, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to come to my home to discuss the
case?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I would be glad to."</p>

<p>"When will you have time off?"</p>

<p>"I could make it about nine o'clock tonight, sir, if
convenient to you."</p>

<p>"Very good. I'll be looking for you." He gave her the
address.</p>

<p><br> When Jermyn brought her in to him, Lee was sitting by the
fire with a whisky and soda before him. Eliza was a comely woman
with a tall, matronly figure and white hair. Her clothes, while
of good material, were soberly made without any concessions to
the style of the moment. She was of a type unusual in America and
seen on the street it would have been hard to place her. Thirty
years' service had rendered her face smooth and expressionless.
She wore a pince-nez that she was continually adjusting and
readjusting.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss Eliza," said Lee in friendly fashion. "You see
I am having a little refreshment. Will you join me?"</p>

<p>Eliza bridled a little. "I take that kind of you, Mr. Mappin.
I don't mind if I do, seeing it's after working hours." Her voice
was unexpectedly small and flat, conveying the impression that
her soul was too small for its ample frame. She sat stiffly on
the edge of the sofa facing Lee. Lee looked at Jermyn over her
head, and Jermyn, comprehending, mixed her a stiff highball at a
table behind her. Lee perceived that the offer of a drink had
stiffened her guard. He thought: That's all right, my lady; it
wouldn't be the first time that good liquor had loosened a
woman's tongue in spite of her. He started a general
conversation.</p>

<p>"I take it you are English, Miss Eliza."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"How long have you been in this country?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years."</p>

<p>"Really! Then you are quite one of us by this time. What
brought you to America in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I came with an American family, Mr. Mappin, who had been
living in England. And the wages was so much higher in this
country that I stayed."</p>

<p>They chatted on about life in America and in England. Eliza,
who set a good value on herself, was not at all put about by
Lee's condescension. At first, she took dainty little sips of her
drink, but as it warmed her, the sips became larger and in the
end it was finished as soon as Lee's. Getting up, Lee took both
glasses to the little table behind her.</p>

<p>"No more for me, thank you, Mr. Mappin," she said primly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he mixed her a good one. When he put it before
her, her expression suggested that she did not intend to touch
it. However, she did.</p>

<p>"Miss Eliza," said Lee, "do you believe that Al Yohe killed
Mr. Gartrey?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Mappin!" she said positively. "On the contrary, I
know that he could not have done it!" She emphasized it so
vigorously that the pince-nez slipped down her nose and had to be
shoved back. "I let him out of the apartment myself a good five
minutes before the shot was fired."</p>

<p>Lee held up his glass and looked through it. "Perhaps he came
back," he said casually. "Did he have a key?"</p>

<p>Eliza was shocked. "No, Mr. Mappin! That would have been
impossible!...Matters had not gone as far as that," she
added.</p>

<p>This was not what Lee had expected. <i>Matters had not gone as
far as that!</i> He took a swallow and turned it over in his
mind.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Yohe would only come back!" sighed Eliza. Lee said:
"He says he won't until he sees a chance of clearing
himself."</p>

<p>"My evidence would clear him, Mr. Mappin!"</p>

<p>"But, don't you see, Miss Eliza, your evidence is canceled out
by that of Hawkins."</p>

<p>"It is supported by Mr. Alan Barry Deane," said Eliza sharply,
"and he's a gentleman of position."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Deane wouldn't make a very good witness."</p>

<p>"Hawkins is a liar!" said Eliza viciously. "If he would only
fall dead it would simplify matters."</p>

<p>Lee wondered if Eliza was echoing her mistress. Agnes Gartrey
had men to do her bidding and unlimited money. Hawkins must be
warned.</p>

<p>"Even if Hawkins should testify," Eliza went on, "there would
be a conflict of evidence and they wouldn't dare convict Mr.
Yohe."</p>

<p>Lee thought: Somebody has been coaching her in the legal
aspects of the case. He said: "We can't be sure of clearing Mr.
Yohe until we find the real murderer. What is your opinion, Miss.
Eliza?"</p>

<p>She stiffened. "Find the liar in the case and you'll have the
murderer, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Obviously," said Lee.</p>

<p>He took her over the whole ground of Monday afternoon. Eliza
told precisely the same story as her mistress and Lee felt that
he was getting nowhere. Every question he put reminded Eliza that
she must be on her guard. He was working to get her to the point
where she would talk on without prompting, but it was a slow
business. He thought he had her when she said in answer to one of
his questions:</p>

<p>"Every time he came Mr. Yohe would have a highball."</p>

<p>"He was a frequent visitor, then," put in Lee casually.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Gartrey told you he was," said Eliza.</p>

<p>Lee, taken aback, applied himself to his drink. This
innocent-sounding answer opened up a vista. Agnes Gartrey had
foreseen that Lee would question her maid and had drilled her in
all the answers. That explained why Eliza not only told the same
story but told it in Agnes' very words. Lee took another
line.</p>

<p>"While the door was standing open between the boudoir and the
dressing room, what did Mr. Yohe and your mistress talk about?
You could hear that part?"</p>

<p>A look of fright came into Eliza's eyes; apparently this was
outside her lesson. She recovered herself quickly. "You must be
mistaken, Mr. Mappin. Madam did not go into the dressing room
until after Mr. Yohe left the apartment."</p>

<p>Lee let it pass. "Did you have warning of Mr. Gartrey's
return?" he asked.</p>

<p>Eliza stared. "I don't understand you, Mr. Map-pin."</p>

<p>"The other day when I was sitting in the boudoir," said Lee
mildly, "I could hear the sound of the elevator door opening and
closing on the other side of the wall."</p>

<p>"We could hear nothing," said Eliza sullenly, "because the
door from the dressing room into the corridor was closed."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her prim airs, Eliza loved whisky and
apparently had not often tasted any so good as Lee's. A tinge of
pink crept into her pale cheeks and her tongue became nimbler.
When Lee placed a third highball on the stand beside her, she
affected not to notice what he was doing. In the end it was a
simple remark of Lee's about Jules Gartrey that loosened the curb
on her tongue. After that Lee had only to sit back and
listen.</p>

<p>"A hard man, Mr. Mappin; a hard man! Inhuman! Nobody could get
along with him because he was so suspicious. He believed that
everybody was trying to wrong him. He looked on all servants as
thieves. It is no wonder that his two previous wives left him in
spite of all his riches."</p>

<p>"Only one wife left him," Lee pointed out mildly. "Well, the
other died," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"My mistress was an angel the way she tried to placate him and
to hide his bad temper from others..."</p>

<p>Lee smiled inwardly at the thought of Agnes in the role of
angel.</p>

<p>"Always so polite and good-tempered with him, deferring to all
his whims. He was never satisfied. And, of course, no servant
could please him. Though the servants worshiped the mistress,
they were always leaving because they could not stand him. I have
been there the longest and I hope to stay with the Madam until I
retire from service. She says she wants me to. Of course, as
Madam's own maid he had very little to do with me. I kept out of
his way as well as I could, but even that put him in a temper. He
said that I failed to show him proper respect and that Madam
should discharge me. She refused. It was the only time I ever
knew her to oppose him..."</p>

<p>Lee, listening to this farrago, wondered how the belief had
gained credence that the truth always came out when whisky
loosened the tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Mappin, nobody would ever believe what my madam had
to put up with from that man! You could tell the moment you
entered the apartment whether he was home or not. All day we
would be so happy and peaceful, and when he came home in the
afternoon a blight would fall on the house. He would always ring
the bell and then open the door with his latchkey. When we heard
that sound our hearts would sink. That day I didn't hear the bell
but only the sound of the latch and then, right away...a shot in
the foyer! I will never forget that moment! I was tidying up
Madam's dressing table..."</p>

<p>So Agnes had finished dressing, then! Lee's face gave no
sign.</p>

<p>Eliza, unaware of the slip she had made, plunged on. "I was
tidying up Madam's dressing table, and I stopped dead in my
tracks. My first thought was of her and I ran out into the
corridor..."</p>

<p>"So she had left you," put in Lee mildly.</p>

<p>Eliza realizing then where her tongue had led her, was
transfixed with terror. "No, no, no," she stammered. "She was
right there in the dressing room with me."</p>

<p>"Then what did you mean by saying your first thought was of
her?"</p>

<p>"I mean...I mean, I thought there was an assassin, a madman
loose in the house and I wanted to save her from him."</p>

<p>Lee affected to believe her. "So you ran out into the foyer
with the idea of grappling with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That was what was in my mind. But I didn't get far
because she called me back to her and we clung to each other like
two sisters! And my madam said: 'Eliza, we've got to go out
there..."</p>

<p>From that point Eliza recited her lesson to the end without
any slips. Lee preserved a bland face. "Drink up," he said
amiably. "It is so distressing to recall these things."</p>

<p>Eliza shook her head. She was still trembling at the
narrowness of her escape. She could not be persuaded to touch the
glass again.</p>

<p>"When you and Mrs. Gartrey finally got out into the foyer,
what did you see?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hawkins was kneeling beside the body, Mr. Map-pin."</p>

<p>"Did he appear to be agitated?"</p>

<p>"Not to say agitated, Mr. Mappin. He was cool enough. But
there was a horrible look in his face. There was murder in
it."</p>

<p>Lee got no more out of her. He had no desire as yet to corner
the woman. First satisfy himself as to the truth of what had
happened was his plan, then go after the evidence. In the
meantime, Eliza and, more particularly, Agnes Gartrey, must not
be put on their guard.</p>

<p>When Eliza finally rose to go, she drank off the rest of the
highball, feeling that she was then safe. Lee rang for Jermyn to
show her out.</p>

<p>"It was very good of you to come to me tonight, Miss Eliza. I
trust you will accept this trifle for your trouble."</p>

<p>Eliza was not at all abashed. "I thank you kindly, Mr.
Mappin," she said, slipping the folded bill in her glove.</p>

<p>Lee rubbed his hands when she had gone. He felt that he was
making a bit of progress. Agnes had been fully dressed when the
shot was fired. This bore out Al Yohe's story. And, what was
more, the two women were <i>not</i> together at the moment when
Jules Gartrey met his end. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR LOASBY came into Lee's apartment with
a heavy, downcast air, and dropped on a sofa. Lee made haste to
mix him a highball.</p>

<p>"Fetch another bottle of Scotch, Jermyn," he said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Loasby said with a groan, "I have three hundred men on the
case, Mr. Mappin, besides the help of the uniformed force. Since
one o'clock the town has been combed from the Battery to
Kingsbridge and we have not turned up a single clue as to that
&mdash;&mdash;'s whereabouts. Some other woman is hiding him now,
I suppose. He seems to hypnotize them!"</p>

<p>"Women love to aid a fugitive," said Lee. "It's something we
have to reckon with."</p>

<p>"If it should ever get out how close I was to Al today and how
he slipped through my fingers, it would break me, Mr. Mappin,"
mourned Loasby. "You must help me!"</p>

<p>"But you said there were no clues."</p>

<p>"Can't you dope out something?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a magician, Inspector. He's a clever fellow. He will
probably do the last thing we would expect him to do."</p>

<p>"You might be able to get something out of Charlotte."</p>

<p>"Excuse me. I'm not going to try to induce a wife to betray
her husband...Look, Inspector, to drop Al Yohe for a minute or
two, I'm a little anxious about old Hawkins in Philadelphia." Lee
hastily sketched the scene with Eliza Young earlier in the
evening. "It is on the cards that they might try to get the old
fellow in order to save Yohe. Are you in touch with the man who
is watching Hawkins?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I've got two men spotting him; Besson and O'Mara. I can
communicate with them any time."</p>

<p>"I suggest you call them up now."</p>

<p>Loasby called a number in Philadelphia. In a moment or two, he
got the small hotel in the suburb of Frankford that served his
two men as headquarters. Besson was asleep upstairs, he was told,
and O'Mara was out on the job. He held the wire while they sent
up to waken Besson. When he got his man, Loasby said:</p>

<p>"Besson, I've had a tip that the people who are trying to
clear Al Yohe may try to rub out old Hawkins to keep him from
testifying. In addition to watching Hawkins, therefore, your job
and O'Mara's is to protect the old man from possible danger. He
should be on his guard against strangers."</p>

<p>After listening to Besson's answer, Loasby repeated it to Lee.
"Besson says that will be easy because he has scraped
acquaintance with the old man, who now looks on him as his
friend."</p>

<p>Lee said: "Why don't you suggest that Besson or O'Mara or both
of them should take a room at Mrs. Quimby's if there's a
vacancy."</p>

<p>Loasby did so. "I want you to get in touch with O'Mara now,"
he added. "Find out what the situation is tonight and report back
to me." He gave Besson the number of Lee's telephone.</p>

<p>Lee made up the fire and they resumed their discussion of Al
Yohe's possible whereabouts.</p>

<p>"At the moment I can't suggest anything but routine measures,"
said Lee. "You must go deeper into the question of who were Al's
closest associates. When he was left out in the air today, he
would have to go direct to somebody he could trust."</p>

<p>"I have it in hand," grumbled Loasby. "Trouble is more than
half the people in cafe society claim to be Al's intimate
friends."</p>

<p>After twenty minutes had passed, the telephone rang. This was
detective officer O'Mara who, as soon as Besson relieved him, had
sought out the nearest telephone to report. Loasby held the
receiver away from his ear so that Lee could hear what he
said.</p>

<p>"About six o'clock this evening, old Hawkins came out of the
house and proceeded to a little restaurant on Frankford Avenue.
He met a young fellow at the door. Hawkins seemed surprised when
the young fellow spoke. They went in and had dinner together.
When they came out they were real friendly."</p>

<p>"Describe the young man," said Loasby.</p>

<p>"About twenty-five years old, Chief. Five foot eleven in
height, weight 170, slender and well built. Wore a gray suit, a
tan topcoat and a gray fedora. His clothes looked new but cheap
material. Black hair, fresh color, blue eyes. Wore glasses with
thick lenses that gave him a funny squint."</p>

<p>"Sounds as if it might be our Al with his hair dyed," murmured
Lee dryly.</p>

<p>"Was it Al Yohe?" Loasby sharply demanded. "Why, no, Chief,"
came the startled answer. "Have you ever seen Al Yohe?"</p>

<p>"No, but I studied his photographs plenty. This couldn't a
been him, Chief." Nevertheless, the voice did not sound
altogether positive.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Loasby.</p>

<p>"After dinner they come back and went in Mrs. Quimby's
together and the light went on in old Hawkins' room, third floor,
front hall. The young man stayed a couple of hours. At nine
o'clock the light went out in Hawkins' room and a minute later
the young man come out of the house and turned in the direction
of Frankford Avenue. I followed him long enough to see him go up
the steps of the Elevated and then I returned to my post."</p>

<p>Lee's face had turned as grim as stone. "<i>The light went out
before the young man left the house!</i>" he murmured. "Instruct
O'Mara to return to Mrs. Quimby's immediately and investigate."
Loasby gave the order and hung up.</p>

<p>Thoroughly alarmed now, there was nothing to do but wait for a
further report. Loasby poured himself a stiff drink; Lee paced
the long room with his hands behind him. Both men became aware
simultaneously of the loud ticking of the ormolu clock on the
mantel. A tug whistled in the river below like the blast of doom,
and they both started. Utter silence followed.</p>

<p>In the end they heard Jermyn's voice in the distant pantry as
he answered the call. Loasby snatched up the instrument without
waiting for the bell.</p>

<p>"Hello? Hello?"</p>

<p>He held the receiver away from his ear and Lee heard O'Mara's
lugubrious voice saying: "You didn't warn us soon enough, Chief.
A terrible thing has happened. Old Hawkins is dead. Poison in his
whisky. Bottle and glass are standing on his bureau, also the
rest of the poison. No label on the bottle. There's been an
attempt to make it look like suicide. A scrawling pencil note on
the bureau as if he was already dying when he wrote it. It
says:</p>

<blockquote> I can't stand it any longer. I have drunk poison. It
was me who killed Jules... </blockquote>

<p>"He started to write Gartrey but didn't get any further than
G-a. The paper was under his forehead as if he had fallen forward
on it while writing. The pencil was placed as if it had just
fallen from his hand. But the killer slipped badly when he put
out the light because the old fellow couldn't have been writing
in the dark, of course. He has been dead a couple of hours."</p>

<p>"Is the lodging house aroused?" asked Loasby.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, yes, and people gathering in the street
already."</p>

<p>"Is Besson with you?"</p>

<p>"I have sent for him, Chief."</p>

<p>"I'll come right down. I'll get a plane. Notify the
Philadelphia police. Don't let them disturb anything until I have
had a look at it."</p>

<p>"Okay, Chief."</p>

<p>Loasby hung up. The two men looked at each other. "My God, I
am cursed with fools!" Loasby cried bitterly. "At nine o'clock
both those men should have been on the job. Then one of them
could have followed the killer!"</p>

<p>Lee, lost in a grim study, was not interested in what might
have been.</p>

<p>"A stupid crime!" cried Loasby, thumping the table. "Nobody
will profit by it."</p>

<p>"As it has turned out, yes," said Lee. "Under other
circumstances it might not have had such a stupid look. I don't
see how Hawkins could have taken up so readily with a man he
didn't know. We must look into that. Notice that the killer
avoided going to Mrs. Quimby's to ask for Hawkins. When the two
of them returned to Mrs. Quimby's, Hawkins opened the door with
his key and the chances are that nobody in the house saw the
killer, either coming or going. Note that he was clever enough to
break off the suicide note before he came to the signature. If he
had not put out the light, and if O'Mara had not happened to be
watching from across the street, it would have been accepted as a
suicide."</p>

<p>"This is some more of the work of that brute, Al Yohe!" cried
Loasby.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why couldn't it have been?"</p>

<p>"You forget that Al Yohe admitted to me he was in the Gartrey
apartment at the moment Jules Gartrey was shot. In fact, his
story bore out that of Hawkins in every particular. What good
would it do him to put the old man out of the way?"</p>

<p>Loasby stared at Lee with widening eyes. "Then...then, it must
have been done at the order of that love-crazed woman! The most
prominent woman in New York. My God, Mr. Mappin, this will blow
off the roof of the town!"</p>

<p>Lee shrugged. "She's just a woman like any other!"</p>

<p>"We could never in the world convict her!"</p>

<p>Lee's lips were pressed out in a thin line. "I promise you I
will, if she's guilty!"</p>

<p>"Will you come down to Philly with me?"</p>

<p>"No. There's nothing for me there. I'll go over the findings
with you when you return."</p>

<p>Loasby hastened away.</p>

<p>Lee continued to pace the living room. "Poor old man!" he
murmured. "His only crime was that he told the truth!" </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE Philadelphia murder occurred just at the
moment when the Gartrey case was beginning to lose some of its
first impetus in the press for lack of fresh fuel. On the
following morning it blazed anew across the headlines of America
in four-inch type. There was a kind of ghoulish joy in the
reporting of the news. To the newspapers it was like a gift from
heaven.</p>

<p>The printed description of the killer reminded everybody of Al
Yohe, and the public (led by the press) instantly made up its
mind that Al had added this second murder to his first. The
police were roundly abused for allowing so dangerous a man to
remain at large. A threatening undertone was heard in the angry
mutterings of the street crowds. The electric chair was too good
for such an inhuman wretch. Citizens who ought to have known
better, expressed themselves in the newspapers to the effect that
anybody who might come face to face with Al Yohe would be
performing a public service by shooting him down.</p>

<p>Lee, reading all this, thought: "If Al were to call me up
today, I would not dare advise him to give himself up."</p>

<p>He made up his mind to go and see Charlotte as soon as he had
breakfasted. Lee's heart was very tender for the little wife. The
poor thing had been through such frightful trials during the past
few days that these hideous stories might well finish her.</p>

<p>It was about ten when he alighted in front of the flat on Park
Avenue. He was very thankful that no hint of Charlotte's
existence had as yet got into the newspapers. There was no crowd
on the sidewalk. Upstairs the door of the apartment was opened to
him by a plain-clothes man with an eager expression. The man's
face fell when he saw who it was, and Lee smiled.</p>

<p>"Did you think your bird had come home to roost?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was hoping it might be something in the shape of a
clue," the man grumbled.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to Mrs. Yohe."</p>

<p>"She's up on the roof with the kid. Go right up."</p>

<p>The last flight of stairs brought Lee out on the roof. It was
a beautiful morning and warm for the season. His eyes took in the
false floor protecting the roof proper; the posts and the lines
strung from side to side for the tenants' washing. On either
hand, an immense modern apartment house rose to the sky; a murmur
of traffic came up from the street.</p>

<p>Charlotte was seated on the coping of the low wall that
separated the roofs of the two smaller houses. The baby slept in
his gocart before her. The girl did not immediately perceive Lee.
She was knitting some sort of little garment of blue wool, and to
Lee's astonishment her face was calm. Yet she had read the
newspapers, for one of them lay at her feet. On the other side of
the roof sat another plain-clothes man, bored and yawning. Lee
thought: Wants to make sure she gets no message by carrier
pigeon. All of Inspector Loasby's men knew Lee by sight, and this
officer made no attempt to interfere between him and
Charlotte.</p>

<p>Charlotte arose at Lee's approach, smiling delightfully, and
flushing pink with pleasure. "Mr. Mappin! What a nice surprise!
How good of you to come and see me!"</p>

<p>Lee was more than a little taken aback. She looked adorable.
"Well...I just wanted to make sure you were all right."</p>

<p>"I'm all right," she said with a lift of her chin. "I have to
keep cheerful on Lester's account. The little fellow feels it
when I give way...I don't like to go down in the street," she
continued, "because the neighbors know that this house is being
watched by the police, though they don't know why. I don't want
anybody to connect it with Lester and me. Lester gets good air up
here, and I can order anything I need for the house by telephone.
Of course, it's a bore to have the police around all the time,
but they're not bad fellows. They make it as easy as they can for
me."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Lee, caressing his chin. He sat down beside her.
"Will it wake the young fellow if we talk?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No fear! He will sleep until his hour is
up, though the heavens fall!"</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Lee again. "I see you've read the newspaper."</p>

<p>She poked it with her foot. "Yes. Such stuff!"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you," said Lee, "that I know, and the police
know, that Al had nothing to do with what happened in
Philadelphia last night."</p>

<p>She turned pink again. "It was kind of you to think of me, but
as far as I'm concerned the assurance wasn't necessary." She
smiled suddenly and bit her lip as at some humorous
recollection.</p>

<p>Lee wondered what was going through her mind. "Even so," he
said, "these ugly stories about Al must have distressed you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't pay any attention to what I read in the papers,
Mr. Mappin. I knew that Al couldn't have been in Philadelphia at
six o'clock last night."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>She laughed outright. "Because he was with me in New York
until after four!"</p>

<p>Lee stared. "Excuse me," he said, "but I'll be
damned!...<i>Where</i> could you have seen him yesterday?...No,
don't tell me," he quickly amended, "for after all, I'm working
with the police."</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you," she said, "because we won't meet
again in the same place. It was in Central Park."</p>

<p>"What about your watchdogs?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "There was only one of them. I gave him the
slip."</p>

<p>"How were you able to make a date to meet Al?"</p>

<p>"There was no date. It was this way. We were out of money and
Al had gone out to get some."</p>

<p>"Where was he going to get it?"</p>

<p>Charlotte's lips closed tight. "I mustn't tell you that."</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"There is a certain unfrequented spot in the park that Al and
I call ours. I kept thinking that he might come there to look for
me, so I asked my watchdogs, as you call them, if I could take
Lester for his usual walk up and down the avenue, and they said
yes. One of them carried Lester downstairs for me. Well, when we
set off I took care never to look behind me, but I knew perfectly
well that the man was following me. At Eighty-sixth and Park
there is a big store that has two entrances, one on the avenue
side, one on the street. At the avenue side I lifted Lester up
and went in, leaving the gocart at the door. Outside the other
entrance there's a taxicab stand, so I just got in a taxi and
told the driver to take me in Central Park. He had to drive back
to Park Avenue before he could turn and I saw my policeman
watching the gocart and knew I was safe from being followed. So I
went to our certain place in Central Park, and sure enough, Al
came along..."</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Lee. "Disguised?"</p>

<p>"A little bit. But I knew him at once." Her laugh sounded.
"Oh, it was clever! Nobody but Al would ever have thought of
anything so simple!"</p>

<p>"Was he alone?" asked Lee grimly.</p>

<p>She hesitated. "I don't think I'd better answer that."</p>

<p>Lee thought: Then he was not alone!</p>

<p>"He sat down beside me," Charlotte continued, "and we talked.
He was mighty thankful to see me. He gave me money and also the
key to our safe deposit box. He told me how to cut some coupons
if I needed more money. Lester was so glad to see his daddy, too.
Al wasn't so much disguised but the baby knew him. He adores his
father. I wouldn't let Al stay but a few minutes. We weren't far
from Eighty-sixth Street and there was just a chance that one of
the watchdogs might stumble on the spot. I drove back to the side
entrance of the store in another taxi and when I came out of the
Park Avenue entrance, there the man was, still watching the
gocart. I made out not to see him. The whole thing didn't take
more than half an hour, so I walked the baby up and down the
street for a while before taking him in."</p>

<p>"You're a clever woman, my dear," said Lee soberly. "I am
sorry to see you playing a losing game." Charlotte merely looked
obstinate.</p>

<p>"Al can keep up this merry game of hide-and-seek for a while,
but it can only have one end."</p>

<p>"Aren't you working for him?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am working to discover the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, if he didn't have anything to do with this Philadelphia
murder, doesn't that prove that he didn't..."</p>

<p>"Robert Hawkins was probably killed by some friend of Al's who
supposed that Hawkin's death would help Al."</p>

<p>"You mean that woman," Charlotte said coolly. "You are right,
of course. And it was she who killed Jules Gartrey. I am
surprised that you can't see that."</p>

<p>"Why should she?" asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"Because it was hateful to have to live with him. He hampered
her liberty...And by his death she becomes one of the richest
women in the country and free!"</p>

<p>"If she hired a man to put Hawkins out of the way, she was
putting herself in the murderer's power for life."</p>

<p>Charlotte shook her head. "No. Because the murderer wouldn't
dare say anything. And, anyway, she's a beautiful woman; she's
able to reduce men to a slavish obedience."</p>

<p>"I'm not saying you're not right," said Lee.</p>

<p>There was a silence. The endless murmur of traffic in Park
Avenue came up to them, ceased abruptly as the lights changed;
commenced again. Lee watched a skywriter, a black speck against
the blue, darting, turning, spinning out his gigantic white
script. Charlotte's needles twinkled and clicked. Her lips were
tight. She said at last:</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think? I think the story of Lester and me
ought to be published in the papers."</p>

<p>"Good God, no!" cried Lee involuntarily.</p>

<p>"If that woman learned that Al had a wife and baby, it would
put her in such a fury of rage that the truth might come
out."</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, think what it would mean! Life would
become impossible for you and the baby!"</p>

<p>Charlotte's chin went up again. "I could stand it. As for
Lester, he's too young to know what's going on, thank God!" She
bent over the gocart. "He still thinks the world is full of
kindness and love."</p>

<p>"Have you discussed this with Al?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. He would never consent to such a thing. He wants
to spare me. But if I was sure it was the right thing to do, I
would act without consulting him."</p>

<p>Lee laid a hand on hers. "No, my dear, no! Your position is
difficult enough as it is!"</p>

<p><br> Lee continued on to his office. There he found Fanny
Parran and Judy Bowles holding court for a dozen newspaper
reporters. Ordinarily, the sight would have pleased him, for he
was proud of the attractiveness of his office assistants and he
liked to see them enjoying themselves. Lee insisted that he was
an amateur and, as such, he said, no speeding-up process was
necessary in his office. Consequently, Fanny and Judy adored
their jobs. But this morning the gay wise-cracking back and forth
made Lee sore. He thought ruefully: This damned case is spoiling
my sunny nature!</p>

<p>Tom Cottar of the <i>Herald Tribune</i> acted as spokesman for
the others: "Mr. Mappin, what do you think of this Philadelphia
murder?"</p>

<p>"What a foolish question!" said Lee sharply. "A brutal,
cold-blooded crime! What would you expect me to think of it?"</p>

<p>"Do you believe that Al Yohe had a hand in it?"</p>

<p>"I never express an opinion as to a man's guilt until after he
is tried."</p>

<p>"Nobody but Al Yohe had any interest in Hawkins' death."</p>

<p>"The officer who saw the killer asserts that it was not Al
Yohe."</p>

<p>"Maybe the cop was just trying to save his face."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But there is also another possibility."</p>

<p>"We are aware of it," said Tom Cottar dryly, "but we're not
allowed to say anything about that." Lee shrugged.</p>

<p>He got rid of them at last. They went away and each cooked up
his own story of the interview in which Lee had not admitted
anything.</p>

<p>Fanny was as sweet as peaches toward her employer this
morning. She was a little uneasy, Lee saw, and keen to find out
what he was up to. She said casually: "I called you at eleven,
Pop, but Jermyn said you'd been gone for an hour."</p>

<p>Lee kept an impassive face. "What did you want?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Loasby phoned to say he had returned to New York
and would like to see you at his office. Or, if that was not
convenient, he'd come up here."</p>

<p>"I'll go down to Headquarters," said Lee.</p>

<p>Loasby gave Lee the gist of his findings in Philadelphia.
Robert Hawkins had been poisoned with cyanide. Cyanide, of
course, would betray itself by its taste, but Hawkins, like all
men who took their whisky straight, had swallowed it at a gulp
and tasted it too late. No fingerprints had been found except
Hawkins' own. Mrs. Quimby reported that Hawkins had received a
letter on the morning of his murder. She had taken notice of it
because he received so few letters. A plain, white envelope
without any printing on it, posted in New York. Addressed in an
ordinary kind of hand, like a clerk's. The maid had handed it to
Hawkins, and after reading it the old man had remarked: "From a
young man I used to know." He had then sent word down to Mrs.
Quimby that he would have his dinner out that evening. Neither
letter nor envelope had been found in his room, the killer
evidently having taken care to remove them. Nobody in Mrs.
Quimby's house had had a sight of Hawkins' visitor the previous
night.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in Philadelphia to furnish a clue to his
identity," said Loasby. "I am working at this end to discover
Hawkins' former associates. He was registered at the Tuckerman
agency before going to work for the Gartreys. I'm also having the
sales of cyanide traced."</p>

<p>Lee stroked his chin. "There's one odd feature of the
situation. If the killer made a date with Hawkins to meet him at
the restaurant, why should Hawkins have been 'surprised' to find
him at the door?"</p>

<p>"I asked O'Mara about that," said Loasby, "and he stuck to it
that Hawkins did not appear to know the young man when he greeted
him."</p>

<p>"This is the way I would explain it," said Lee. "Somebody was
looking for a man to liquidate old Hawkins. It is hardly possible
that a man could be found who knew Hawkins and was willing to
take on the job of rubbing him out, just like that. It is likely
that they signed the name of one of Hawkins' acquaintances to the
letter and gave the job to a professional killer. This one
explained to Hawkins why he had come instead of the friend he
expected, made friends with the unsuspicious old man during the
meal, and afterwards suggested going to Hawkins' room for a
drink."</p>

<p>"That's the way I figure it," said Loasby.</p>

<p>While Lee was at Headquarters, Fanny called up to say that Mr.
George Coler of Hasbrouck and Company was trying to get in touch
with him.</p>

<p>"I'm not far from his office," said Lee. "Tell him I'll be
there directly."</p>

<p>Once more Lee was led through the magnificent suite of lofty
rooms to George Coler's private office. The beauteous
receptionist swam before him as gracefully as a swan. Today,
however, the astute banker was far from showing his usual
savoir-faire; his high-colored face was mottled in hue and etched
with harassed lines; one eyelid twitched nervously; he was unable to
keep still. Today he took care to close the door of his office
after Lee had entered.</p>

<p>"So good of you to come down, Mr. Mappin. I'm really in no
shape to do business today, but I have a dozen important
meetings." He attempted to carry it off with a laugh. "I suppose
the market would break if I went home."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"It's that damnable murder in Philadelphia last night!"</p>

<p>Lee wondered why the murder of a poor old butler should upset
the great and powerful banker to this extent. While Coler railed
on against the crime, he quietly waited to find out.</p>

<p>"Horrible!...Absolutely cold-blooded!...The man must be
insane!...What's the matter with the police? Is Al Yohe to be
allowed to go on killing at his own sweet will?"</p>

<p>"This one wasn't Al Yohe's work," said Lee.</p>

<p>Coler whirled on him. "How do you know that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, there is certain evidence in the hands of the police
that proves it couldn't have been Yohe."</p>

<p>Coler's agitation increased. "Good God, Mappin! Do you mean
that the police have information that hasn't been given out?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. They can't reveal their whole hand."</p>

<p>Coler approached him with his face working. "What sort of
information?"</p>

<p>Lee held up his hands. "I couldn't tell you that, Mr.
Coler."</p>

<p>"You can tell me! I'm not a newspaperman. I'm accustomed to
keeping things to myself. I have a right to know this!"</p>

<p>Lee continued to shake his head. Coler paced the room, biting
his lip.</p>

<p>Lee thought: Coler believes that it was Agnes who had old
Hawkins rubbed out and that it will be brought home to her. He's
in love with Agnes.</p>

<p>Coler succeeded in controlling his agitation. "Mappin, whom do
the police suspect?" he asked frankly. "You are safe with
me."</p>

<p>"They don't 'suspect' anybody yet. There is no positive
evidence."</p>

<p>Coler came close to Lee and let a hand drop on his shoulder.
His air of candor was very winning. "Map-pin, you are no
policeman," he said. "You don't belong in that galley. You belong
with us. I want you on my side."</p>

<p>Lee affected to look blank. "I'm afraid I don't understand
you."</p>

<p>"I will be perfectly plain with you. I want you to work for
me, Mappin&mdash;may I call you Lee? This is your profession and
you are at the head of it. In a matter as important as this you
can ask me any fee you like. But it's not a question of pay. I
know you don't care particularly for money. This affects your own
self-interest, Lee."</p>

<p>"I don't quite get you," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You and I belong to the so-called better class. We've got to
stick together. We are the rulers and we've got to maintain our
position. Numerically we are few and the muckers, the roughnecks,
the mob, they are many. We've got to keep them down, by any
means. How glad they would be to get back at us, led by the
sensational press. We mustn't give them such an opening,
Lee!"</p>

<p>Lee continued to look blank.</p>

<p>"Suppose a woman of our class, an infatuated woman, lost her
head and...and became implicated in a nasty crime. Think what an
opportunity it would give to all the rabble rousers in the
country to stir up the masses, to preach hate against the upper
class. Especially in a time of excitement like this. It would be
a terrible blow to our prestige, Lee!"</p>

<p>"I think you exaggerate the importance of the situation," said
Lee dryly. "The newspapers, yes, but they don't cut very deep;
they have to be finding new sensations all the time. I can't see
it becoming a national issue. And, anyhow, I never could feel
that I belonged to any particular class, either upper or lower. I
suppose it's a defect in my make-up."</p>

<p>As Coler began a fresh tirade against the unruly masses, Lee
stopped him with a gesture. "I see your point, Mr. Coler, but I
cannot change my course now. I have handed over certain evidence
to the police and in return Inspector Loasby has taken me into
his confidence. So you see..."</p>

<p>Coler heard only one phrase of this. "What evidence have you
turned over to the police?" he demanded excitedly.</p>

<p>Lee held up his hands.</p>

<p>The interview did not last much longer. It was something new
for the powerful banker, accustomed to obedience and subservience
from all, to meet with firm opposition and he did not take it
well. There was the hint of a threat in his final shot at
Lee.</p>

<p>"You are making a serious mistake, Mappin! We are powerful; we
know how to defend ourselves; we stand by our own!"</p>

<p>Lee got out. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">ON Wednesday night Miss Delphine Harley was
opening at Gilbert Miller's Theatre in <i>Trumpet Vine</i>, a new
comedy by Philip Barry. Since the star, the manager and the
playwright all enjoyed the highest popularity, it promised to be
a triple-barreled social event, the most important of the
pre-Christmas season. Miss Harley had sent Lee a couple of seats.
When the night came he was in anything but the right mood for the
furor of a fashionable first night, but it was Judy's turn to be
taken and he could not bear to disappoint her; he dressed for it
with a sigh. Judy had been looking forward to this for days
ahead. Lee had presented her with a new dress that he had picked
out himself, a soft, royal-purple satin with a billowing skirt.
Choosing costumes for his girls was one of his most delicate
pleasures.</p>

<p>Police were holding back the dense crowd in front of the
theater. It was music in Judy's ears to hear the exclamations of
the people as she crossed the sidewalk&mdash;and Lee did not find
it exactly unpleasant. "Ahh! ain't she beautiful!...That's the
prettiest one we seen...Who are they?...The little fellow is Amos
Lee Mappin, the writer. I seen his pitcher in the paper."</p>

<p>The rear of the theater was jammed with people from the
cheaper seats who had come down to see the arrival of the
notables. From the stairway, which provided the best point of
vantage, came shrill cries: "Look! there's Kitty Carlisle!...Oh,
there's Vera Zorina!...Madge! Madge! there's Jimmy
Stewart!...You're crazy! It's just a hall room boy thinks he
looks like Jimmy. If it was Jimmy in person, he'd be mobbed!"</p>

<p>It was a long, slow business to get through to the aisle.
"What a childish people we are!" grumbled Lee. "Will we ever grow
up?"</p>

<p>Judy squeezed his arm. "I love it, Pop! I really feel like
somebody when I am out with you!"</p>

<p>After the usual delay, the performance started. From the start
it was evident that Gilbert Miller had another hit on his hands.
The usually difficult first-night audience was lifted out of
itself. Miss Harley's first act entrance was greeted with
applause that stopped the show. She was playing the part of a
county girl from Maryland who, when transplanted to New York,
revealed all the devious cleverness of another Eve. The audience
loved her. She gave a most brilliant performance, yet Lee, who
knew her pretty well, had a feeling that something was amiss. Her
art was perfect, but the natural, spontaneous humor that
constituted her special charm, seemed a little strained, and when
the curtain went down he said as much to Judy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought she was lovely!" said Judy
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>It occurred to Lee that the girl's voice sounded a little
self-conscious.</p>

<p>After the second act, while the theater rang with applause and
the curtain was raised again and again to allow the smiling Miss
Harley to acknowledge it, Lee wrote on the back of his card:
"Congratulations! You were immense!" and sent it to the star's
dressing room by an usher. He and Judy remained in their seats to
avoid the awful crush at the back of the theater. Before the
curtain rose again the usher brought Lee a note within a sealed
envelope. It read:</p>

<p><br> Dear Lee:</p>

<p>I must see you tonight. Don't come to my dressing room,
there'll be a mob there. I'll shake them as soon as I can and
come to your place. So don't go to bed!</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>D.</p>

<p><br> Lee handed the note to Judy. "There is something wrong!"
Judy looked so queer while she read it that he was impelled to
ask: "Do you know what it is?"</p>

<p>Judy was startled. "Good heavens, Pop! How should <i>I</i>
know what's the matter? I scarcely know Miss Harley. I haven't
seen her for ages. Whatever put such an idea into your head? I'm
sure I'm not in Miss Harley's confidence..."</p>

<p>"Methinks she doth protest too much," murmured Lee, and Judy
fell silent.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Judy lost a supper by it, for Lee felt that he ought
to hasten home. He stopped at his favorite delicatessen on the
way to buy smoked turkey and other delicacies, for Jermyn had not
been instructed to stay up and he wasn't sure what there might be
in the refrigerator. Jermyn was in bed, and while Lee waited for
Delphine he bustled around setting the table, beating up eggs
ready to scramble when she came in, and so on. Lee loved to fuss
around kitchen and pantry, and was fond of complaining that he
never got a chance.</p>

<p>Delphine did not keep him waiting too long. Looking through
the open door into the dining room, she flung her arms around
Lee. "Darling! How did you guess that I would be starved to
death!"</p>

<p>"Well, you've done a good night's work," said Lee.</p>

<p>She accompanied him out into the kitchen while he cooked the
eggs. "I love kitchens! Scrambled eggs and smoked turkey! My
favorite combination. I hope you put water in the eggs instead of
milk. Milk makes them tough."</p>

<p>Lee could see that she was nervous. He let her take her own
time in coming to the point. She asked him questions without
waiting for the answers.</p>

<p>"What did you think of the show tonight? Everybody said it
went all right, but I know I was terrible. I couldn't keep my
mind on the play. I was just an automaton. What a time I had
getting away afterwards! I know I've made a hundred enemies.
There was a supper party at Pierre's. I never should have got
away if Gilbert hadn't helped me. He saw that I was all in..."
And so on. And so on.</p>

<p>They carried the food into the dining room and sat down.
Delphine refused a cocktail and Lee poured her a glass of
Montrachet.</p>

<p>"Let me eat a mouthful before I tell you what I came for," she
pleaded. "Honestly, I'm famished."</p>

<p>"Take your time," said Lee. "We have all night."</p>

<p>She ate, but did not on that account stop talking. "This play
has been the very devil to lick into shape! Casting trouble; one
part after another. They wanted me to open cold in it, but I
absolutely refused. So we were booked for Monday and Tuesday
nights in Syracuse. That meant two performances and two whole
days of rehearsing. I got back to New York at four this afternoon
and had to drive direct to the theater to run through my scenes
with Claude Danforth. A good actor, but he will not listen during
a scene. It's maddening! This turkey is delicious. So I didn't
get home until after six, just time enough for a bite and back to
the theater again..." She suddenly laid down her fork and looked
at Lee imploringly. "Good heavens, Lee! I don't know what you
will say to me! I am frightened out of my wits!"</p>

<p>"How can you be afraid of me?" said Lee. "I am so little!"</p>

<p>"You're little," she said, "but, Oh, my!...Lee, I found that I
had a guest in my apartment...Whom do you think it was?...It
was...It was Al Yohe."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Lee. He was not, however, greatly surprised.
He had felt it coming.</p>

<p>Delphine nodded her head violently. "Yes, Al Yohe. Did you
ever hear of such a colossal nerve? Making himself perfectly at
home. Waited on hand and foot by my two adoring maids."</p>

<p>"Is he still there?" asked Lee grimly.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. You can call up if you like. I told him I
was going to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then he won't be there now," said Lee, resuming his meal.</p>

<p>"Of course, I ought to have called you up before the
performance," Delphine went on, "but I just couldn't bring myself
to do it! The poor lad had flung himself on my mercy with
complete confidence that I wouldn't betray him. And those
terrible stories in the papers today and all! And if I <i>had</i>
given him up, I would certainly have lost both my maids. Just at
the beginning of the season, too, it would have been beastly
awkward. As soon as I settle down in this part I want to do a
little entertaining..."</p>

<p>"So you had dinner with him."</p>

<p>She nodded with a guilty smile. "And I never was better
entertained, Lee. He's so beguiling! I tried to be stern with
him, but he made me laugh!"</p>

<p>"How long had he been there?"</p>

<p>"Since yesterday at half past one."</p>

<p>"Was he disguised?"</p>

<p>"His hair was dyed black and he wore a cunning little
mustache. That was all except a grocer's apron and a basket of
vegetables."</p>

<p>"Vegetables!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he came to the service door yesterday with his basket.
He sat down in the kitchen, and within half an hour, I gathered,
had my cook and my housemaid completely charmed. He told them who
he was. They knew he was a friend of mine and they put him in my
spare bedroom and went out to do his shopping for him. Later in
the afternoon&mdash;this is the most incredible part,
Lee&mdash;he told them his wife was short of money and he wanted
to get in touch with her and give her some. His <i>wife</i>, Lee!
Did you know he had a wife? A wife <i>and</i> a baby! <i>Al
Yohe</i>!"</p>

<p>"I knew it," said Lee. "Go on."</p>

<p>"It didn't make any difference with those two infatuated
females...Well, it didn't make any difference with me, either! Al
is such a lamb! But I'm truly sorry for the woman who married
him! He put on a pair of black glasses Cook had bought for him,
and took a stick, and Cook led him through the streets as if he
were blind. Cook is so respectable, you know, she in herself
would be the best of disguises. Everybody looked at them so
sympathetically, she said."</p>

<p>"What's your cook's name?"</p>

<p>"Rose. Mrs. Rose Craigin. She's sixty if she's a day, but
still romantic!"</p>

<p>"Al Yohe is a devil!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"That's what I said. But so beguiling, Lee! The way his
eyelids fold at the corners...They met his wife in the park. Such
a sweet girl, Cook said. And the baby, of course. He gave her
money and Cook led him back to my place. Nobody suspected them.
Nobody would ever suspect them."</p>

<p>"He spent the night in your apartment?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And all day today. Incidentally, Lee, he couldn't have
gone to Philadelphia yesterday, because both girls swear that the
three of them played five hundred all evening with a dummy in my
dining room. But wouldn't it be terrible if they had to testify
to that. I'd be disgraced!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it won't be necessary," said Lee dryly. "I am already
satisfied that he wasn't in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Well, if he didn't kill the man in Philadelphia, perhaps he
didn't kill the man in New York, either. Lee, I simply cannot
believe that Al Yohe is a murderer!"</p>

<p>Lee snorted indignantly. "Just because his eyelids fold so
sweetly at the corners! Really, Delphine, you are as bad as your
maids! I thought you had more sense!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm only a woman," she retorted with spirit, "and
perhaps weak where a handsome young man is concerned. But I have
not altogether taken leave of my senses at that. I've been
around; I've known a lot of men and I would be willing to bet my
last dollar that this man has not got a murder on his
conscience!"</p>

<p>"I hope to God you may be right," said Lee. "Drink your
wine."</p>

<p>As soon as she left him, Lee dutifully conveyed Delphine
Harley's story to Inspector Loasby by telephone. The Inspector
was bitter.</p>

<p>"You are always telling me just too late where Al Yohe could
be found!"</p>

<p>"I lost no time in passing it along," said Lee.</p>

<p>"By God!" exploded Loasby. "I'm going to prosecute those two
maids for concealing a criminal! I'll make an example of
them!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to arrest Miss Harley, too," Lee pointed out. "Do
you want to take that responsibility?" Loasby subsided in sullen
profanity.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your time in such side issues now," Lee urged.
"After we clean up this case it will be time enough to decide
who's to be punished."</p>

<p>Loasby immediately sent men to Miss Harley's apartment, but,
of course, the bird had flown hours before. The frightened maids
asserted that he had left immediately after Miss Harley went to
the theater. At that time he had no disguise except his dyed hair
and his little mustache. Once more the city had swallowed Al
Yohe. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">ALL day Wednesday and Wednesday night Loasby was
engaged in rounding up the underworld characters of Manhattan.
Every young man suspected by the police of being a potential
killer was brought into Headquarters and questioned. At noon on
Thursday, the Inspector called up Lee in high satisfaction.</p>

<p>"At last we've had a break, Mr. Mappin. We have got the man
who killed Robert Hawkins."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "You are certain?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. O'Mara has positively identified him as the man
who ate dinner with Hawkins in Frankford and afterwards
accompanied Hawkins to his room."</p>

<p>"What about the waitress who served their dinner?"</p>

<p>"I've sent to Philadelphia for her."</p>

<p>Later Lee drove down to Headquarters to have a look at the
prisoner. Loasby said:</p>

<p>"His right name appears to be Dominick Stacey, but he has gone
under many aliases. They call him the Jocker, or Jocker Stacey.
He has a long police record. Has been suspected of a gangster
killing but has never been up on a homicide charge. A thoroughly
bad egg."</p>

<p>"He's been questioned, I take it."</p>

<p>"Questioned?" said Loasby grimly. "And how! Going on four
hours now. By the best men I've got. He hasn't weakened. Claims
that he spent Tuesday afternoon and night with his girl. She's
been brought in; swears that Jocker was with her in her room the
whole time; that she cooked supper for him. The alibi is
worthless because they can't name anybody who saw them between
the hours of four and midnight on Thursday."</p>

<p>"You have searched his place and hers for the price of the
murder?"</p>

<p>"Sure. No results."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's been told that he would get off easier if he
told who hired him."</p>

<p>"Sure. And laughed in our faces."</p>

<p>While Lee was in Loasby's office, the waitress from
Philadelphia was brought in by a detective. As soon as he saw
her, Lee felt dubious of the result. A pale, anemic little woman,
excitement and terror had reduced her almost to a gibbering
state. The heavy, fatherly air that Loasby adopted toward her
only frightened her the more. She could scarcely articulate.</p>

<p>On an upper floor at Headquarters, the usual scene was staged
in the theater where the line-up took place every morning. The
woman from Philadelphia was seated in the dark auditorium along
with Lee, Loasby and several detective officers. A strong light
was thrown on the stage and six men, all of about the same age
and same general appearance were led upon it to stand in line.
Five of them were presumably police officers. Each in turn was
required to stand this way and that, to walk, to assume a pair of
thick-lensed glasses, to answer a few questions. They were then
all taken off the stage and sent back upon it, one at a time.</p>

<p>While the fourth man was standing in the strong light Loasby
nudged Lee to let him know that this was the prisoner. Lee was
saddened by the sight of him, he was such a fine physical
specimen; tall, muscular and hard. A four hours' grilling from
the police had not so much as ruffled his nerves. He was smiling
a little. Under other circumstances, Lee thought, he might have
been a hero.</p>

<p>To Inspector Loasby's delight, the woman picked the right man.
But when the performance was repeated, she chose another man, and
when they went through it again, still a different one. Loasby
swore under his breath and she broke into a hysterical weeping.
The performance was called off and Lee saw the prisoner being led
away with a contemptuous smile. They all trooped downstairs.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," grumbled Loasby, "we're no worse off than
we were before. O'Mara's identification is positive."</p>

<p>"After the woman's nerves quiet down, try her again,"
suggested Lee.</p>

<p><br> As Lee and his girls were preparing to close the office
for the day, there was another phone call from Headquarters.
Loasby's voice sounded agitated.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, Charlotte has given us the slip."</p>

<p>"Hey?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"Shortly before four she expressed a wish to take the baby out
for an airing. She had been before and they let her go. She was
followed, of course. She went into a store at the corner of
Eighty-sixth, leaving the gocart in the street. This store had a
second entrance on the side street and my man stood on the corner
where he could watch both doors. She was in the store quite a
while. Then he saw her run across the sidewalk carrying the baby
and get in a taxi. It was the only taxi on the stand. My man
commandeered a car to follow, but the driver was rattled, he
says. Anyhow, the taxi made a getaway in the traffic."</p>

<p>"Maybe she'll be back," suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"I doubt it. The taxi returned to his stand in a couple of
minutes. Said he'd driven her just a little way into the park. He
took my man to the place, but of course there was no sign of
Charlotte. I'm convinced she's gone to join Al. We have the
gocart."</p>

<p>Lee sympathized with the harassed Inspector.</p>

<p>"Well, this may prove to be Al's undoing," said Loasby with
forced optimism. "It is possible for a single man by disguising
himself to keep out of our hands, but a wife and a baby will
treble his risks. You can't disguise a baby. I'm confident we'll
have all three of them within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>Lee smiled into the transmitter. "I trust so," he said.</p>

<p>"I called you up," Loasby continued, "to warn you that I could
no longer keep the wife and baby out of the picture. I must send
out a general alarm for them now."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that," said Lee, "but, of course, I see the
necessity. When are you going to give the story out?"</p>

<p>"Immediately."</p>

<p>After he had said good night to the girls, Lee had himself
driven up to the Gartrey apartment. He wanted to be present when
Agnes Gartrey heard the news. He was shown into her boudoir. She
was alone. Her greeting was invidious. Very likely George Coler
had warned her against Lee; perhaps she was wondering if it was
really worth while any longer to keep up the pretense that they
were friends. Lee was not at all put out by her insolent
indifference. It was more comfortable to be on an honest
footing.</p>

<p>As always, he enjoyed Agnes as disinterestedly as he enjoyed a
fine work of art. He didn't want her for his collection. The last
few days had left their mark on her; make-up could no longer hide
the little hollows in her smooth cheeks, the slightly sunken
eyes. Lee, regarding her as a connoisseur, considered that these
evidences of human passion really made her look handsomer than
before. When everything was going well, her face was too smooth,
too perfect. In order to explain his presence, he said:</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like to hear some of the latest developments
in the case that concerns us both so deeply."</p>

<p>"That was good of you," she murmured. "I know nothing but what
I read in the papers. I have to act a lie with everybody who
comes here. It is only with you that I can be myself !"</p>

<p>So she had decided that it would be worth while to flatter him
a little further!</p>

<p>Lee heard a slight sound as of someone approaching in the
corridor. It aroused his suspicion because he did not hear it go
away. For the moment he said nothing.</p>

<p>Watching Agnes closely without appearing to, he started to
tell her in detail of what had happened in Philadelphia. Moving
about the room in her silken draperies, indifferently arranging
her bibelots, she was listening with the keenest attention. But
the story did not appear to come close to her at any point. This
woman was armed against surprise; she had only one
weakness&mdash;Al Yohe. Lee thought with professional admiration:
Agnes Gartrey has the makings of a great criminal!</p>

<p>"Such a stupid crime!" he said.</p>

<p>Agnes shrugged. "Aren't all crimes stupid?"</p>

<p>Lee finished his story by saying: "The police believe that
they have the murderer. He goes by the name of Jocker
Stacey."</p>

<p>Agnes lit a cigarette. "Has he confessed?" she drawled.</p>

<p>"No. He offers a phony alibi."</p>

<p>That was all. She was turning the dials on the radio. It was
overdone. More natural if she had shown some elation at the death
of one she looked on as her enemy, and a little curiosity in
respect to his killer.</p>

<p>Again Lee heard the merest breath of a sound in the corridor.
"Do you know," he said softly, "I think somebody is listening at
that door?"</p>

<p>Agnes strode silently to the door and threw it open. The
servant Denman was standing there. "The latest newspaper, Madam,"
he said coolly. "You asked me to bring it to you at once."</p>

<p>She took the newspaper, staring at him hard. The man's face
was smooth and obsequious. He bowed and retired. Agnes watched
him until he had disappeared into the foyer. Closing the door,
she tossed the newspaper on a chair. Out of the tail of his eye,
Lee saw that the story of Charlotte had not yet broken. Agnes
said:</p>

<p>"I don't know if he's a spy or not. I suppose I'd better
discharge him just to be on the safe side."</p>

<p>"Don't," said Lee. "If he is a spy, let us do a little spying
on him and we may learn something to our advantage."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," she said, returning to the radio.</p>

<p>The small incident made Lee thoughtful. He knew that Denman
was a spy. But now that his original employer was dead, whom was
he spying for?</p>

<p>Agnes said: "Do you mind if I turn on the news broadcast? I
have noticed that when the police have anything to give out it
usually comes at this hour."</p>

<p>"Go ahead." Lee braced himself.</p>

<p>They listened to war news, to a stock-market report, to a
well-known movie star's endorsement of a brand of beer.</p>

<p>"What a lot of tripe you have to endure before you get what
you want," drawled Agnes.</p>

<p>From the radio the pleasant male voice continued:</p>

<p><br> "Inspector Loasby, head of the New York City detective
force, issued an important statement concerning the Al Yohe case
at Headquarters this afternoon. Inspector Loasby said, quote:</p>

<p>"'The police have known for some days past that Al Yohe is
married and has a baby, Alastair, Junior, about nine months
old...'"</p>

<p><br> Lee was looking blandly at Agnes. Her face showed no
change of expression, but under her make-up her color subtly
changed, making her face suddenly look like a badly painted
waxwork. Lee turned his head away. The voice continued:</p>

<p><br> "'For more than a year past Mrs. Yohe has been occupying
a walk-up apartment at number &mdash;&mdash; Park Avenue under
the name of Mrs. Matthews, and Al has spent as much time there as
he could spare from his duties as host and publicity agent of La
Sourabaya night club. He is described as a very affectionate
husband and father. This information was withheld from the public
while the house was kept under police surveillance in the
expectation that Al might steal home to see his little family,
but he has not done so. On the contrary, this afternoon Mrs. Yohe
took the baby and succeeded in evading the police guard at the
house, and it is assumed that she has gone to join her husband.
She was last seen at 4 P.M. on an unfrequented walk in Central
Park in the neighborhood of the East Drive near Ninetieth Street.
She was then carrying the baby. A general alarm for them has been
issued.'"</p>

<p><br> Agnes Gartrey rose suddenly&mdash;and dropped limply back
on her chair. Her eyes were devoid of all sense. She had
forgotten Lee.</p>

<p><br> "'Mrs. Yohe's first name is Charlotte. She is twenty-three
years old, five feet four inches in height, weight 118
pounds; has a graceful, well-formed figure. Her skin is very
white and she has a faint natural color in her cheeks; blue eyes,
light brown hair. Has a sweet and gentle expression except when
roused to defend her husband. When last seen she was wearing a
black cloth skirt and black pumps; a finger-length coat of beaver
fur cut very full; a small hat of beaver with a touch of red
velvet. All her clothes are of expensive materials.</p>

<p>"'The baby is nine months old, weight eighteen pounds, blue
eyes, fine, soft hair just beginning to come in. A sturdy child.
Is at the age where he likes to pull himself to his feet. Will
soon be walking. Wore an oyster-white beret, pleated coat and
leggings, all of a soft material resembling velours. As his
motherleft his gocart behind, she will have to carry him until
such time as she can procure another. A small, pretty,
expensively dressed girl carrying a child that is really too
heavy for her, ought to be a conspicuous object wherever seen.
The nearest policeman should be notified.'"</p>

<p><br> The speaker passed to another subject and Agnes switched
off the radio. Unable to bear Lee's bland, steady gaze, she
turned away from him. After a moment she murmured hoarsely:</p>

<p>"You have known this from the first?"</p>

<p>Lee said: "I have known it for a few days past."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you warn me?"</p>

<p>"I was forbidden by the police."</p>

<p>"Surely <i>I</i> had a right to know!"</p>

<p>"They gave me no latitude."</p>

<p>After a silence she said in an uncertain voice: "You had
better leave me."</p>

<p>Lee sat still. He could imagine the hell of bitterness that
filled the woman, supposing that she had had a man murdered for
nothing&mdash;possibly two men, but he was unable to feel much
pity for her. He kept his mouth shut, knowing that a passionate
woman cannot endure a silence.</p>

<p>Her voice scaled up hysterically. "Did you just come here to
gloat over me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You lie! You're enjoying this!"</p>

<p>"Far from it," said Lee soberly.</p>

<p>She whirled around. Her beautiful face seemed to have
disintegrated. She looked awful. Her voice rose almost to a
scream. "Then what did you come nosing here for? What are you
after? What are you after?"</p>

<p>"The truth," said Lee.</p>

<p>She laughed in an ugly fashion. "The truth: A fat lot you care
for the truth! You came here to see me suffer! You're just an
idler, a sadist! It gives you pleasure to humiliate people and
watch them suffer!"</p>

<p>Lee took a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>Her voice rose higher. "Well, I'll tell you the truth! Nothing
can be hidden now! I'll pay him off, at any rate. I don't care if
it destroys me, too. The truth is I have ruined myself for a liar
and a murderer! It was Al Yohe who shot my husband! He hadn't
left the house when Jules came home. He was sitting here in this
room while I dressed. I lied and I forced my maid to lie in order
to save him! Al was sitting here; the door into the corridor was
open; he could hear the elevator door slide back; he ran out into
the foyer and shot Jules. He had threatened to do it!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>The little question pulled her up short. "Why? Why?" she
repeated, staring wildly.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have planned to marry you if he had a wife to
whom he was devoted."</p>

<p>She sneered. "How do you know he was 'devoted' to her?"</p>

<p>"He arranged to have her join him today, though it would
double the risk for both of them. Apparently he can't do without
her."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain passed over Agnes' face. With a frantic
gesture, she tore part of the lace at the bosom of her negligee
and let it hang. Even in her abandon, there was something
theatrical in her aspect. "Oh, God!" she cried, "and this is the
man I lied to save!"</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question," Lee reminded her.</p>

<p>"I don't have to answer your questions!"</p>

<p>Lee faced her down. "What reason could Al have had for
shooting your husband ?"</p>

<p>With an effort she obtained control over herself. "I'll tell
you...I'll tell you. Al owed Jules two hundred thousand dollars
for the decorations in La Sourabaya, and he couldn't pay it! Two
hundred thousand dollars! That's what he killed him for!"</p>

<p>"He'll have to pay his estate," suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"He'll gain time."</p>

<p>"Did you see Al shoot Gartrey?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I almost did. I almost did. When I heard the shot I ran into
this room. Al was gone. I ran into the music room. Through the
opening I could see Jules lying on the floor in the foyer and Al
standing over him with the gun in his hand, staring down with an
expression of fiendish rage. The gun was smoking! Al didn't see
me. He dropped the gun, snatched his coat and hat out of the
closet and ran back into the service corridor. And I...I went to
my poor husband."</p>

<p>She put a hand to her eyes in a heartbroken gesture. Lee was
not impressed. "Where was Eliza?" he asked dryly.</p>

<p>"She joined me in the foyer."</p>

<p>"Let us have Eliza in here," said Lee.</p>

<p>Agnes dropped the sorrow-stricken pretense. "I'll do nothing
of the sort!" she said furiously.</p>

<p>Lee was standing near the fireplace. He put out his hand and
pushed the bell button. Agnes ran to intercept him but was too
late. She was panting like a runner, almost speechless with
rage.</p>

<p>"How dare you...how dare you presume to give orders in my
house!"</p>

<p>"This is hardly the time for good manners," said Lee. "I want
to see the woman before you have time to rehearse her in a new
story."</p>

<p>Denman entered. His black eyes were as bright and soulless as
shoe buttons. Agnes, walking quickly away to a window, kept her
back turned to them.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Eliza about?" asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"Why...why, I believe so, sir."</p>

<p>"Please ask her to step here for a moment."</p>

<p>Agnes, without turning around, spoke from the window. "Do no
such thing! I forbid it!"</p>

<p>The man looked sharply from one to the other. Lee, when it
suited him, had a powerful eye. He said quietly: "You heard me.
Fetch Miss Eliza here."</p>

<p>The man went out like an automaton, closing the door after
him.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Eliza was in the adjoining room, the
dressing room. Lee heard a rush of feet in the corridor.
Hastening to the door, he flung it open, but was only in time to
see Eliza disappearing through the door into the foyer. She
slammed it after her.</p>

<p>The manservant was standing openmouthed in the corridor. His
expression of innocent confusion was overdone. "I...I told her,
sir," he stammered, "but she ran away."</p>

<p>Lee could not very well chase the lady's maid through the
apartment. He turned back into the boudoir, closing the door and
helping himself to another pinch of snuff as an aid in recovering
his poise.</p>

<p>"Now you get out!" snarled Agnes.</p>

<p>Lee's eyebrows ran up. "Shouldn't we have a little further
talk?" he mildly suggested.</p>

<p>"Get out! Get out!" she screamed. "I want no further talk with
you! Oh, how I hate you, nasty, sneering little man! Making
believe to be my friend! Pretending that you knew nothing and all
the time leading me on! I see now what your game is. That was
just a cock-and-bull story you told the police about Al Yohe
forcing his way into your place. You know where he is! Al is your
favorite, isn't he, and you are bent on getting him off at my
expense! Not if I know it! Not if I know it! I'll tell all now. I
don't care who is hurt by it. Eliza and I together will convict
him! I'll see him burn!"</p>

<p>"You had better sleep on it first," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Get out!" she screamed. "I know what I've got to do! You're a
liar and a cheat! You're a traitor to your own class..."</p>

<p>Lee thought: She has seen George Coler.</p>

<p>Agnes flung at him what was to her the final insult:
"Communist!"</p>

<p>Lee couldn't help himself; he laughed. "Good afternoon," he
said bowing. On his way out he had a sense that somebody was
keeping out of sight in the music room, but he did not
investigate. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lee let himself into his own apartment,
Jermyn was in the gallery. He said: "Mrs. Gartrey just called you
up, sir."</p>

<p>Lee smiled grimly. "Already?"</p>

<p>"Wanted you to call her up the moment you came in, sir. Said
it was vitally important."</p>

<p>Lee went to a telephone. Agnes had changed her tune. "Oh, Mr.
Mappin, what must you be thinking of me!" she wailed. "I lost
control of myself. Will you believe me when I say I didn't mean a
word of what I said! It was due to the shock of what I learned
over the radio."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," said Lee soothingly. "And can you ever
forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Lee. "I am not at all a sensitive person.
You are freely forgiven."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good of you!"</p>

<p>She went on protesting her remorse, while Lee waited, smiling,
for the real object of her call. Finally it came.</p>

<p>"I hardly dare ask it after what has happened, but will you
please, <i>please</i>, come back to me right away? We must, as
you said, talk things over. You are the only one who is in my
confidence, the only one who can help me to do what is
right."</p>

<p>Lee's smile became broader. "Surely, I'll come right
back."</p>

<p>"Don't take action of any sort until you have seen me!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Mrs. Gartrey."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>thank</i> you!"</p>

<p>In the magnificent entrance hall of the Gartrey apartment
house, Lee found George Coler pacing up and down, biting his lip.
His face still had a mottled look. He slipped his hand under
Lee's arm as if they had been intimate friends and led him away
out of hearing of the hall attendants.</p>

<p>"Mappin, I am so thankful I was able to intercept you," he
said. "Don't go up to Mrs. Gartrey now."</p>

<p>"But why not?" said Lee. "She sent for me."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, I have just left her. She is beside
herself."</p>

<p>"I understand that. I was here earlier."</p>

<p>"She told me you were...Mappin, this story given out by the
police today has administered a frightful shock to her. She is
half out of her mind. Doesn't know what she is doing."</p>

<p>Lee wondered what the man's game was. Perhaps he was actually
telling the truth. It's the last thing one suspects of a
prominent man nowadays.</p>

<p>"It will be a good thing in the end," Coler continued. "It
will cure her of this insane infatuation for Al Yohe. I had hoped
to see her get over it gradually. I knew I could trust her good
sense in the long run. But to get it like this has completely
bowled her over...Just give her a little time to find herself,
Map-pin. It is cruel to press a woman in her condition."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to press her," said Lee. "Just what is it that
you are afraid of?"</p>

<p>"She appears to be determined to tell her story to the
newspapers, to the police, to publish it to the world! It would
ruin her whole life. In mercy, Mappin..."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to allow her to do anything like that," said
Lee, "not if I can prevent it."</p>

<p>Coler stared. "You mean that?"</p>

<p>"Surely. I am no believer in the sensationalism of the press.
It not only feeds the public's worst appetites, but sometimes
obstructs justice as well."</p>

<p>"And the police?" asked Coler anxiously.</p>

<p>"I have no intention of passing on her story to the police at
this juncture."</p>

<p>Coler picked up Lee's hand and pumped it up and down. "Thank
God!" he exclaimed. "I knew you were a good fellow, Mappin! We
had some hasty words in my office that I am sorry for; I knew you
were sound at heart!"</p>

<p>"Well, thanks!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do a thing with Agnes!"</p>

<p>"It may not be as bad as you think. I have often noticed that
a woman is most obstinate when she is at the point of giving
in."</p>

<p>Coler laughed heartily. "That's good!" he said. "I must
remember it. You don't mind if I bring it out as my own, do you?
We can't all be as witty as you are."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Call me up after you have talked to her," said Coler with a
glint of ugly eagerness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I can't promise to do that," said Lee coolly. "Not if she
talks to me in confidence, you know."</p>

<p>Coler gave him a hard look and strode on out of the
building.</p>

<p>Upstairs Lee was once more shown into the pink boudoir by
young Denman. The servant's face was as smooth and waxen as ever.
Agnes received Lee with an air of deprecating wistfulness. She
had changed the torn negligee for a sober black and white robe,
and her face had been made up anew. When the servant left the
room, she reassumed her heartbroken air and made play with a lace
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Lee cut short her self-reproaches. "Please," he said, "I have
forgotten what happened here earlier. I made all allowances for
the shock you received. Let's begin over."</p>

<p>"You are so good," she murmured, touching the handkerchief to
her eyes. "Have you telephoned what I told you to the
police?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"To the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!"</p>

<p>Agnes lowered her head to hide the look of satisfaction in her
face. "I am suffering cruelly," she murmured in a piteous voice.
"No man could ever understand what I am going through!...Long
practice has made Al Yohe expert in deceiving women. I didn't
realize that. His air of frankness and honesty was perfect! Day
after day he came here to pour out his pretended passion for me.
I laughed at him, then I listened, then I weakened. I led such a
loveless life, you see. And all the time he had murder in his
heart! He was just using me as a means of reaching my husband!
Could a woman suffer a more awful humiliation!"</p>

<p>Lee thought: Your story does not hang together very well, my
lady.</p>

<p>"I am only a woman," she continued, "with all a woman's faults
and weaknesses. The only way I can heal the frightful wound he
has given me is by helping the law to punish him. I want to see
him suffer. Do you blame me for that?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Lee briskly.</p>

<p>"He no doubt still believes that he can do anything he likes
with me and I don't want him to be warned that I have turned
against him. The only dangerous witness against him, as he
thinks, has been removed by death and he may give himself up now,
thinking that he can brazen out his crime with my help. I want my
pitiful story to remain a secret until after Al Yohe is lodged in
jail. I will then tell the whole truth as a warning to other
women."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I would advise," said Lee. "Then I can
depend on you to say nothing?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely!" Lee, delicately probing like a surgeon, asked
casually: "Why didn't you say this to George Coler just now and
put him out of his anxiety?"</p>

<p>Agnes looked at him sharply. "What about George Coler?"</p>

<p>"I met him downstairs. He was half sick with anxiety because
you had told him you were going to publish the whole story. He
begged me to reason with you."</p>

<p>She shrugged pettishly. "George irritates me so that I say
things to him I don't mean. I suppose he's the best friend I've
got, but he's in love with me."</p>

<p>"So I gathered," said Lee.</p>

<p>"It's horrible to me to be reminded of that now. I'm done with
men forever! I hate love!"</p>

<p>Lee thought: I wonder!</p>

<p>"However," she went on, "I promise you I will make it up to
him. George is really a good fellow."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Lee. "Can we depend on Eliza to keep her mouth
shut?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely...You wanted to talk to Eliza, didn't you? I'll
call her." She went to the door of the dressing room and opened
it. "Eliza, come in, please. Mr. Mappin wants to talk to
you."</p>

<p>Lee thought: Not much use now since they've had their heads
together.</p>

<p>Eliza entered self-consciously. Her large, pale face wore an
expression of lugubriousness fashioned after that of her
mistress. She, too, had a handkerchief. She was perspiring and
the pince-nez kept slipping down.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Lee. "I don't like to see you standing when
you're in such distress."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" moaned the lady's maid, seating herself on the
extreme edge of a chair.</p>

<p>"Tell me precisely what happened on that tragic Monday
afternoon."</p>

<p>Eliza wiped her eyes. "Sir, I said what wasn't true when I
told you that I had let Mr. Yohe out of the apartment before the
shot was fired. He was still here. He was sitting in this room
while I dressed Mrs. Gar-trey. At first, the door was open and
they talked back and forth, but before I disrobed her I closed
the door."</p>

<p>Lee thought: So far, this is true. He asked with a casual air:
"Was the door from the dressing room into the corridor open?"</p>

<p>The question took Eliza off her guard. "Yes...no...I don't
remember, sir."</p>

<p>"It was closed," put in Agnes sharply. "All the doors are
closed while I am dressing."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Lee. "Please go on, Miss Eliza."</p>

<p>"I had almost finished dressing Mrs. Gartrey when we heard the
shot. Mrs. Gartrey jumped up and ran in here."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Me? I was paralyzed with fright, sir. For a moment or two I
couldn't move. Then I thought of my mistress. My mistress came
first with me. I ran in here after her. The room was empty. I ran
on into the music room and she was there. I was in time to see
Mr. Yohe disappearing through the rear door in the foyer. He
didn't see us. After a little, Mr. Hawkins, the butler, came into
the foyer and kneeled down beside Mr. Gartrey's body."</p>

<p>Lee looked questioningly at Agnes.</p>

<p>"I must make a correction in my statement there," she said
quickly. "Eliza is right. Eliza and I remained clinging to each
other in the music room until after Hawkins came out into the
foyer."</p>

<p>"I see," said Lee. He turned to the maid. "In your former
statement you said you ran through the corridor into the
foyer."</p>

<p>Eliza hung her head. "I was not telling the truth, sir."</p>

<p>"But what reason did you have for saying that?"</p>

<p>"No particular reason, sir."</p>

<p>"Hawkins stated that you came out of the corridor door."</p>

<p>"Hawkins was a liar," said Agnes sharply. "What difference
does it make, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"You are right," said Lee soothingly. "It makes no difference.
But this is important. Miss Eliza stated to me that you had left
the dressing room before the shot was fired; that she was alone
in there when she heard the shot."</p>

<p>Agnes looked daggers at the maid. Eliza was terrified. Her
nose glasses fell off. "No, sir! No, sir! You have that wrong,
sir. We was together!"</p>

<p>"I made a note of it at the time."</p>

<p>"No, sir! I never said such a thing, sir. I couldn't have said
it, it's not true! We was together!"</p>

<p>"Think what you are saying, Eliza," put in Agnes acidly. "Mr.
Mappin mustn't get the impression that we have anything to
hide."</p>

<p>The maid adjusted her glasses with shaking fingers. "No,
Madam, I know that. You and me was together. Please believe me,
sir."</p>

<p>Agnes said harshly: "Sooner or later you will have to go on
the witness stand, Eliza. Will you be able to swear to what you
say?"</p>

<p>"I will swear it before any judge in the land!" cried Eliza.
"We was together in the dressing room when we heard the shot. And
you said: 'What's that?'"</p>

<p>"That's all, Miss Eliza," said Lee. "And thank you very
much."</p>

<p>Eliza went back into the dressing room holding her
handkerchief to her face.</p>

<p>"So you see," said Agnes, "there cannot be the slightest doubt
that Al Yohe is guilty."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Will you have a drink?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I mustn't wait for that."</p>

<p>Lee walked home. The act of walking supplies a gentle stimulus
to the brain, and he saw things in a clearer light. He had spoken
truly when he told Agnes he had no doubt. He believed that he at
last knew what had happened. When a liar repudiates his lie and
tells another, he gives away more than he is aware of. His
successive lies point the way to the truth. But Lee had not a
scintilla of evidence to take into court. I must have evidence!
he said to himself. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">MEANWHILE Inspector Loasby was working hard on
the Robert Hawkins' murder and on the following afternoon,
Friday, he telephoned gleefully to Lee that he had built up a
complete case against Jocker Stacey. Lee went down to
Headquarters to hear his report.</p>

<p>"The Philadelphia waitress has recovered her nerve," Loasby
said to Lee. "Today she picked out Stacey from among six men
three times running without any hesitation. That in itself is
enough to send him to the chair. But I have also been confronting
him with different trainmen and conductors of the Pennsylvania
Railroad as they came into New York on their runs, and he has
been positively identified by two men as having been on the 2:30
train from New York on Tuesday afternoon. Another trainman swears
that he was aboard the 9:38 from West Philadelphia to New York
Tuesday night. It's lucky for us that the Jocker is a striking
looking fellow. A clerk at the Information Desk in the West
Philadelphia Station has identified him as the man who asked how
to get to Frankford Tuesday afternoon. It all fits together, you
see."</p>

<p>"Does he know you have secured this evidence against him?"</p>

<p>"Sure! I told him that he might as well come clean now, but he
only laughs. He has engaged Harry Brummel for his attorney."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Lee. "Stacey must have been handsomely paid for
this murder."</p>

<p>"You said it, Mr. Mappin. Brummel comes high. The most
conspicuous criminal lawyer in New York, and the most
unscrupulous. A sinister figure, if you ask me; I hope I may live
to see him disbarred. He has the reputation of never having lost
a homicide case. The crooks of this city look on him as a
superman. But I don't see how even Brummel can get this killer
off."</p>

<p>"The District Attorney had better watch his jury," said Lee
dryly. "There are millions available to beat this case."</p>

<p>Loasby was presently called on the telephone by the celebrated
Harry Brummel. The Inspector first looked pleased as he listened
to his communication, and afterwards suspicious. He said to him
on the wire:</p>

<p>"All right, I'll have him brought here, Mr. Brummel. You may
be present while he makes his statement, but I must warn you not
to prompt him nor communicate with him in any way, or I'll have
to call the proceedings off."</p>

<p>When he hung up, Loasby gave an order for Dominick Stacey to
be brought from the Tombs to his office. Loasby said to Lee with
a scowl: "Brummel says that after consulting with his client and
learning the extent of the evidence against him, he has advised
him to come clean, and Stacey has agreed...I don't much like the
look of it, Mr. Mappin. Brummel is too slick. I suspect there's a
trick in it."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly sure there is a trick in it," said Lee coolly.
"Some of the most powerful interests in New York are out to get
this man off."</p>

<p>"How can they hope to get him off?" said Loasby, spreading out
his hands, "a cold-blooded, premeditated murder and six witnesses
ready to swear that Stacey is the man!"</p>

<p>"They're working for a verdict of manslaughter," said Lee
dryly. "Stacey would be glad to take a sentence of ten years,
wouldn't he, with a third off for good behavior, and a million,
say, waiting for him when he came out?"</p>

<p>Loasby whistled softly.</p>

<p>The effulgent Mr. Harry Brummel was presently brought in, a
man in his forties who didn't look his age, very sure of himself,
very beautifully dressed&mdash;too beautifully dressed for Lee's
taste. Lee disliked him intensely, but concealed it pretty well;
Loasby less successfully. Brummel, slick and obsequious as he
was, nevertheless managed to convey that he didn't give a damn
what anybody thought of him. He had a thick skin. His client was
brought in between two officers. Jocker Stacey, tall, hard and
insolent, looked pleased with himself, too.</p>

<p>"I understand you are ready to make a statement," said
Loasby.</p>

<p>"That's right," said the prisoner with an impudent grin. "My
lawyer tells me I'll get off easier if I come clean."</p>

<p>"Sure; Judge, Prosecutor, jury, will be more lenient with you
if you assist in bringing the principal criminal to justice. But
you understand, nobody is making any bargain with you in advance
for clemency."</p>

<p>"I get you, Inspector."</p>

<p>"You can sit down if your statement is going to run to any
length. I must warn you that whatever you say here can be
introduced as evidence at your trial."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>The prisoner sat down and Loasby's secretary was brought in to
take his statement. Jocker asked for a cigarette and it was given
him. He said:</p>

<p>"Last Tuesday, November 11th, I took the 2:30 train on the
Pennsylvania to West Philadelphia. I asked in the station how to
get to Frankford and was told to take the Elevated. In Frankford
I mooched around to get the lay of the land and afterwards went
into the Red Lion cafe to wait until six o'clock. I met old
Hawkins outside a restaurant. I had never seen him before but he
was described to me. I was told to explain to him that the friend
he expected had gotten a position that day and had asked me to
take his place as he wanted to blow Hawkins to a good
feed..."</p>

<p>"What was this friend's name?" put in Loasby.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you, Inspector; Jack something. I only heard
the name once and it has slipped my mind. It was a fellow Hawkins
had worked with some place previously."</p>

<p>"All right. Proceed."</p>

<p>"Hawkins was suspicious of me at first but I talked him
around. We ate dinner and afterwards we went around to Hawkins'
room to drink. I had a pint flask of rye and the poison in a
little bottle. I read in the papers it was cyanide; I didn't know
what it was before. I was just told to give him a few drops in
his whisky. We had a few drinks together first and the old man
got a little mellow. It was simple to distract his attention for
a moment and put the drops in his glass. He swallowed the shot
and just give me a look; he couldn't speak; he went out like a
light switched off. I fixed the suicide note the way I had been
told and left the balance of the whisky and the poison on the
bureau and got out. Took the 9:38 from West Philly back to New
York. Oh, yes, I forgot to say I was told to look for the letter
the old man got that day. So I searched his pockets and I took
it."</p>

<p>"What name was signed to that letter?"</p>

<p>"I never read it, Inspector. Tore it up and threw the pieces
away in a toilet in the railway station."</p>

<p>"Why did you put the light out in Hawkins' room?" asked
Loasby.</p>

<p>The young man betrayed no emotion beyond a slight annoyance.
"You can search me, Inspector. Certainly was a dumb play."</p>

<p>"You were pretty excited, I take it."</p>

<p>This touched the killer's pride. "No, sir!" he said quickly.
"That old guy was nothing to me."</p>

<p>"If he was nothing to you, why did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"It was a job. I got paid for it."</p>

<p>"Who paid you?"</p>

<p>All the men in the room were hanging on his answer. Jocker,
gratified to find himself the center of so much attention, paused
and grinned from one to another. "Al Yohe," he said coolly.</p>

<p>Muttered imprecations escaped from some of the men. Lee,
however, was differently affected. So this is the plot! he
thought. My course is clear from now on. I'm on Al Yohe's
side.</p>

<p>Loasby said: "Describe the circumstances under which Yohe got
in touch with you."</p>

<p>"It was the Monday night previous, Inspector. I was playing
pool with some fellows in Slater's parlor on Grand Street. There
was this guy sitting among a lot of other guys in chairs along
the wall. He was disguised and I didn't recognize him; nobody in
the place did. After the game was over he come up to me and said:
'You're a good player, Jocker; will you drink with me?' Well, I
could see by his clothes that he was a guy from uptown and I
thought there might be something in it. So we had a drink there
in the back room of Slater's. 'How did you know my name?' I asked
him, and he said: 'I heard the men talking about you. Guess you
don't know what a famous guy you are around here, Jocker.' Trying
to butter me up, see? So I let him buy me all the drinks he
wanted and we talked, he all the time hinting there was something
pretty good in it for me, something big.</p>

<p>"So before he come to the point he said: 'We better go to some
place where you're not known, Jocker,' and we went out of
Slater's and he said: 'How about the Biltmore bar? There's such a
crowd there nobody would remember us after.' And I said okay, and
we drove uptown to the Biltmore and took a table in the bar and
the guy continued to buy, and we got real friendly. So finally it
come out: was I willing to take on a job down in Philly? 'What
kind of a job?' I ask, and he said, 'Liquidating an old guy who's
got one foot in the grave already.' I give him the big laugh and
made out I took him for a stool pigeon trying to get something on
me. So he said: 'I'm in no position to sing to the police. Look
me over good,' he said, and took off his glasses. So then I seen
it was Al Yohe and I said, just to kid him, I said: 'What's to
prevent me turning you over to the cops? It would square me for
life with the cops. I could get away with anything after.' And he
said: 'You won't do that.' And I said: `Why won't I?' And he
said: 'Look under the table.' And I looked and I seen he had a
gun out and pointed at my guts. And I said: Tut away your barker,
kid, I ain't doing business with the police.'</p>

<p>"So I been reading about Al Yohe's case in the papers and I
knew what he wanted to rub out the old guy for. He mentioned a
grand and I said nothing doing. When I got him up to three grand,
half in advance, I seen he wouldn't go no higher, so I said okay,
and we shook hands on it. We talked over the details and Al said
he would write to the old guy that night. So we made a date to
meet in the same place at twelve noon on Tuesday. Al was there
waiting for me at noon and it was then he give me my last
instructions and the whisky, the bottle of poison, the suicide
note and pencil, and the fifteen hundred dollars. Promised to pay
the balance in a week. I wasn't worrying about that because he
knew that if he didn't come across I could tip off the police by
mail or phone."</p>

<p>"Did you make another date to meet Al Yohe?" asked Loasby.</p>

<p>"No, Inspector. Al knew where he could find me any time."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the fifteen hundred?"</p>

<p>"Gave it to my girl to keep for me. After I talked to Mr.
Brummel today I sent word to her to bring it down to Headquarters
and hand it to you, Inspector. Mr. Brummel said if I was going to
come clean it had to be clean."</p>

<p>Some of the officers in the room put their hands before their
mouths. None dared to grin openly in the powerful lawyer's face.
Lee said:</p>

<p>"May I put a question, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Jocker," said Lee, "if you're giving up all the money you
have, how are you going to pay Mr. Brummel?"</p>

<p>The prisoner's hard face betrayed not a flicker of expression.
"Mr. Brummel, he said he would take his chance of being paid. He
wouldn't take the case, he said, unless I gave up the dirty
money."</p>

<p>"Knowing," said Lee dryly, "that there would be plenty more
where that came from."</p>

<p>Brummel jumped up with a great parade of indignation. "Mr.
Inspector, I object to such foul insinuations in the presence of
the police!"</p>

<p>Loasby said: "This is not a courtroom, Mr. Brummel. Mr.
Mappin's remarks are off the record."</p>

<p>Having registered a formal protest, Brummel was immediately
all smiles and obsequiousness again. He came around to where Lee
was sitting and laid a hand on his shoulder. "No hard feelings, I
hope, Mr. Map-pin. I certainly would not like you to get a down
on me. I look on you as the cleverest brain in New York
today."</p>

<p>His hypocrisy made Lee feel a little sick at his stomach. He
offered his snuffbox to Brummel, who hastily drew back. "Clever,"
said Lee blandly, helping himself to a pinch, "but hardly as
clever as all that."</p>

<p>When the prisoner was taken away and his gaudy lawyer had
departed, Lee and Loasby faced each other across the latter's
desk. The Inspector said solemnly:</p>

<p>"This begins to look like a devilish plot, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"It has the smell of it," agreed Lee.</p>

<p>"Their stories all fit together so neatly, and there is no
evidence on the other side. How the devil are we going to expose
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;yet," said Lee, "but I mean to give my
whole time to it. I'm for Al Yohe now." He felt a curious
lightness in saying it. The conflict between his mind and his
feelings was over.</p>

<p>"I feel a little like that myself," said Loasby, "but it looks
bad."</p>

<p>Lee said: "The name that was signed to the decoy letter would
furnish a valuable clue. Jocker was certainly lying when he said
he didn't know it. I don't approve of so-called third degree
methods but any <i>legitimate</i> pressure that you could bring
on Jocker to get that name out of him..."</p>

<p>"I have it in mind," said Loasby, "but how can we accomplish
anything as long as Al Yohe is a fugitive?"</p>

<p>"You are right. However, if I knew where Al was at this
moment, I wouldn't tell you."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"If Al was arrested, the case would be taken out of our hands
and perhaps rushed to a fatal conclusion before we could act
effectively."</p>

<p>"You don't know where Al is, by any chance, do you?" demanded
Loasby suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I do not," said Lee smiling, "but I warn you, if I find him
I'll keep it to myself."</p>

<p>Loasby frowned, not quite knowing how to take this. "Well, if
I can't find him, I don't guess you can."</p>

<p>"Probably not," said Lee. "I suppose we can't keep the story
of Jocker Stacey's confession out of the newspapers for the
moment?"</p>

<p>Loasby shook his head. "Impossible! If we didn't give it out,
Brummel would. It's part of his game to get his side of the case
before the public before it can be questioned." </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">DURING the past ten days Stan Oberry, at Lee
Mappin's order, had been quietly investigating the sales of fresh
Beluga caviar. None had been imported since the war. Only one
firm in the city, Chandler and Company, had a dwindling stock of
the delicacy in cold storage. The price had soared and sales were
few, but each sale was found to have a destination above
suspicion.</p>

<p>Late Saturday afternoon, while Lee was in his apartment, Stan
called to make a report. "Half an hour ago," he said, "just
before Chandler's closed for the day, they received an order for
a pound of that Russian stuff I thought you'd like to hear about.
The order was from La Sourabaya..."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lee, "Al Yohe's joint! Decidedly interesting!"</p>

<p>The order was brought by Franois, an old waiter from the
night club, who paid cash for the stuff, which seemed a little
strange because La Sourabaya's credit is plenty good at
Chandler's. The waiter insisted on having it packed in dry ice
because, he said, it was for a customer in the country."</p>

<p>"Better and better," said Lee. "Go on."</p>

<p>"My man followed Franois when he left Chandler's. He took the
package to La Sourabaya, right enough, and carried it in with
him. I thought you'd like to know that it was a fancy, pasteboard
box about a foot square, green in color, with Chandler's label on
the top and a broad red stripe around the middle of the box."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Lee. "I'll get dressed and go to La
Sourabaya for my dinner."</p>

<p>The night club opened at six o'clock for the dinner trade and
Lee in evening clothes was on hand soon after. A new Captain
received him in the foyer. Lee said:</p>

<p>"I am told you have an excellent waiter here called Franois.
I'd like to have him if he is available."</p>

<p>"Most certainly, sir."</p>

<p>Lee was almost the first to sit down in the immense, dimly
lighted hall, decorated to represent a night scene in the East
Indies. La Sourabaya at the dinner hour had a very different
atmosphere from La Sourabaya after midnight. There was no music
or floor show; the emphasis was all upon good food and wines. By
taking care of the finer details, Al Yohe had succeeded in
attracting a small, but very choice clientele for dinner. Among
other things he had dug up three or four old waiters of the rare
sort that is fast disappearing from the earth. Franois was one
of them. He came to the table bowing. With his pleasant, wrinkled
face, curled lock of hair and side whiskers, he looked like a
painting by Daumier.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Franois," said Lee.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon soir, M'sieu</i>. You know me, then?"</p>

<p>"I never saw you before, but you have been recommended to me
and I asked for you especially."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, M'sieu."</p>

<p>"I am early," said Lee. "Let us take our time over
dinner."</p>

<p>The old man was innocently pleased. "Yes, sir! Yes, sir! So
one should dine! But <i>Les Americains</i> are always in a
hurry!"</p>

<p>Lee picked up the menu. "To begin with, I would like a morsel
of fresh caviar."</p>

<p>Franois' old face made a picture of distress. "I am sorry,
sir, there is none. You see it has been removed from the card. We
have not had any since...since Mr. Yohe went away."</p>

<p>"You are sure you could not find me a portion in the
pantry?"</p>

<p>"Not for love nor money, sir. It is still to be had in New
York, but when a customer desires it, we must be notified in
advance."</p>

<p>Lee with a shrug appeared to let it go. Studying the menu, and
consulting with Franois, he ordered his dinner. Franois entered
into the choice with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>During the course of the meal he hovered around the table
solicitously. At the moment he had no one else to wait on.</p>

<p>"Franois," said Lee, "don't you find it rather trying for a
man of your years to work in so popular a restaurant? Such crowds
come here every night."</p>

<p>"I do not serve the late-comers, sir. Younger men are required
for that. I am only for dinner. My hours are from five-thirty
until nine-thirty."</p>

<p>Lee thought: So much the better!</p>

<p>Later Franois was emboldened to ask: "If it is not presuming,
<i>M'sieu</i>, what gentleman was it that recommended me to
you?"</p>

<p>Lee said: "It was no other than Mr. Yohe himself." The old man
was curiously moved. Unable to speak, he looked at Lee with moist
eyes and trembling lips. Lee said: "You were attached to Mr.
Yohe, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!" Franois said softly. "I owe much to Mr.
Yohe. The whole staff was attached to him. It is not the same
since he is gone. He was a fair-minded man; he would listen to
you. Always you had to laugh with him. The lowest bus boy in this
place felt that Mr. Yohe was his friend."</p>

<p>"I, too, am his friend," said Lee. "I am convinced that a
terrible mistake has been made."</p>

<p>The old man's eyes glistened. He would have liked to shake
Lee's hand but recollected himself in time. "You are the first
gentleman I have heard to say that, <i>M'sieu</i>! All were his
friends before; all are against him now."</p>

<p>"What did you mean by saying that you owed much to him?" asked
Lee.</p>

<p>"Mr. Yohe engaged me to work here, sir. I was having a very
difficult time because everybody else said I was too old. But Mr.
Yohe said he wanted men who had grown old in service. He was
pleased with my work here. He said that I attracted the kind of
dinner custom he wanted. Already there is a change since he is
gone. I fear...That is why I was grateful to you, sir, for asking
to be served by me."</p>

<p>Lee said: "Do not fear for the future, Franois. There is
always a place for one as good as you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, <i>M'sieu</i>!"</p>

<p>Lee found a Romane Conti on the wine list that pleased him
and he ordered a second half bottle with cheese. This spun out
the meal until after eight o'clock. Upon leaving, he gave
Franois a tip that almost reduced him to tears again. Lee felt
oddly drawn to the gentle old man whose passion was for service.
If there were more like Franois, the world would be a pleasanter
place, he thought.</p>

<p>Lee took a taxi at the door and had himself driven around the
park to kill time. Back in Fifty-second Street shortly before
nine-thirty, he had his man draw up at the curb across the road
from La Sourabaya. He sat back in the cab smoking a cigar and
watching the service entrance.</p>

<p>At nine-forty, Franois came out with, to Lee's great
satisfaction, the green pasteboard box with a red stripe under
his arm. The old man hailed a taxi with a self-important air and
drove off to the east. Lee said to his own driver:</p>

<p>"Double fare if you keep that cab in sight."</p>

<p>They were led east to Park Avenue and north to Seventy-fourth
Street. The first cab turned the corner and stopped before the
service entrance of an expensive apartment house. Lee smiled to
himself. It was the house where Delphine Harley lived. Lee had
his driver wait across the street. Franois paid off his cab and
went in, carrying his box. In a few minutes he came out again
empty-handed and walked away toward Lexington Avenue. As soon as
he was out of sight, Lee paid his own driver and went in the
service entrance. Slipping half a dollar to the attendant at the
elevator, he said:</p>

<p>"An old man just came here to deliever a box. Do you mind
telling me whom it was for?"</p>

<p>The young man was only moderately surprised by the question. A
New York elevator attendant has to be ready for anything. "He
took it up to Miss Harley's apartment, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Lee.</p>

<p>Outside he hailed another cab and had himself driven to the
stage door of Gilbert Miller's Theatre. He knew that the second
act of <i>Trumpet Vine</i> ended at a few minutes past ten, and
it was almost that. The doorkeeper said politely:</p>

<p>"Miss Harley never sees anybody during this entr'acte, sir.
She has to make a complete change."</p>

<p>"A very old friend," said Lee. "I'll send in my card. If she
can't see me, I'll wait until the final curtain."</p>

<p>Delphine knew that Lee would not call at this awkward moment
unless there was something in the wind, and she did not keep him
waiting. He found her in the hands of her maids; she had a towel
around her neck, her bright hair was caught up in a knot on top
of her head, her face was covered with cold cream.</p>

<p>"I have to change my make-up," she explained, "because I'm
supposed to be chastened in the last act."</p>

<p>"Don't let me interrupt you," said Lee. "I only wanted to make
sure that I could carry you off after the show before anybody
else got you."</p>

<p>"How exciting! But why, Lee?"</p>

<p>Lee glanced at the maids. "It's a long story and I don't want
to interfere with your dressing."</p>

<p>"But I'm booked to have supper with the Wintringhams at the
St. Regis."</p>

<p>"You can be a few minutes late, can't you? I'll deliver you to
the St. Regis before midnight."</p>

<p>"Surely, I can be a little late."</p>

<p>"Good! I'll be waiting in a cab at the stage door."</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later, Delphine, issuing from the
stage door, started talking before she was well inside the
waiting cab. "What on earth is up, Lee? I am consumed with
curiosity. Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"To your place," said Lee, giving the address to the
driver.</p>

<p>"To my place? What for?"</p>

<p>"Have you any fresh caviar, Beluga by preference?"</p>

<p>"Caviar? No!"</p>

<p>"Have you ordered any?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. It's worth about a million dollars a pound,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not quite that."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, it's too much for a working girl. What put
caviar into your head?"</p>

<p>"I think we'll find a consignment in your pantry, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Stop talking in riddles."</p>

<p>"I followed it as far as your house. In a fancy green box with
a red stripe around it. I believe it's on its way to Al
Yohe."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Delphine. She fell silent.</p>

<p>Lee was aware that she had hardened. He put a hand on hers. "I
ought to tell you, my dear, that I have had a change of heart in
respect to Al Yohe. As I see the plot developing against him, I
can no longer believe that he is guilty. And I promise you that
if I do find him, I shan't hand him over to the police. But it is
necessary for me to consult with him before I can defend him to
advantage."</p>

<p>Delphine relaxed. She moved closer to him. "Well, that's a
relief. I knew you had a good heart, Lee. As for me, I never
could believe that Al was guilty. Honestly, I don't know where he
is, but I suspect that Mrs. Craigin, my cook, knows. You'll have
to handle her with gloves, though."</p>

<p>"I was hoping I wouldn't have to handle her," said Lee. "Won't
she be asleep at this hour?"</p>

<p>"She ought to be, because I said I wouldn't be home until
late. The other maid, too."</p>

<p>"I suppose the police have been after Mrs. Craigin."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, yes! They questioned me, too, but I satisfied
them I knew nothing. They've been here again and again to
question Cook. She stood them off. Said she hadn't seen nor heard
from him since he walked out of the door, and stuck to it. I was
proud of her. I think the police have given her up as a bad job
now."</p>

<p>As they entered the apartment, Delphine whispered, "We ought
to talk in normal voices. If one of them is awake we don't want
to sound like conspirators."</p>

<p>Lee raised his voice. "Yes, I am hungry, darling. What is
there?"</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," said Delphine.</p>

<p>In the pantry and in the little kitchen adjoining, there was
no green box visible. Delphine called Lee's attention to a faint
rumbling sound not far off. "Cook's asleep, all right," she said
giggling. She threw open the refrigerator door. No box.</p>

<p>"There's ham," said Lee in a normal voice. "A ham sandwich and
beer would just touch the spot."</p>

<p>"Fetch it into the dining room," said Delphine. In a lowered
voice she went on: "I'll take a look in her room. If she wakes, I
can make some excuse."</p>

<p>In a moment or two she was back in the dining room. "You're a
wizard," she said. "The green box is on a chair in her room
hidden under a jacket. She didn't wake."</p>

<p>"Where's the other maid?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"She lies down on the lounge in my dressing room until I come
home."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow is Cook's Sunday off, I take it."</p>

<p>"You have guessed it, wizard!"</p>

<p>"Do you know where she goes?"</p>

<p>"She has a sister in service in the country near Greenwich,
Connecticut. I don't know the sister's name or whom she works
for, but Cook asked me today if Martin, my chauffeur, could take
her to Grand Central tomorrow morning in time for the 10:11 train
for Greenwich."</p>

<p>"That is sufficient," said Lee.</p>

<p>After eating his sandwich and drinking his beer, he took
Delphine to the St. Regis and went on home. Before going to bed,
he called up a garage that he patronized and arranged to have a
town car with a reliable driver waiting at the door of his house
at 9:15 on Sunday.</p>

<p>It was a clear, cool day with bright sunshine. Lee sat back in
the corner of his car, smoking, gazing at the scenery, revolving
the problems of the Al Yohe case. After he got out of the city
the glimpses of tree-bordered Pelham Bay that he obtained and the
ineffable blue of the Sound were lovely.</p>

<p>He had some difficulty in fitting George Coler into his
puzzle. He could not believe that Coler had had a hand in the
Philadelphia murder. However you looked at it, it was too
hare-brained a scheme to appeal to a man of experience. And, anyhow,
George, being in love with Agnes Gartrey, was not likely to lend
himself to the job of removing the only dangerous witness against
Agnes' favored lover. But supposing that Agnes had embarked on
this without the knowledge of George, George's anxiety after the
event was perfectly understandable. He could see what a dangerous
situation Agnes was in. It was undoubtedly George who had engaged
Harry Brummel to get her out of it.</p>

<p>The plot to hang the murder of Hawkins on Al Yohe bore the
Brummel earmark. It was likely to be successful, too, considering
the state of popular opinion, unless Al could produce a
watertight alibi for the hours that Jocker Stacey claimed Al had
spent with him. And who could testify for Al but Charlotte? The
testimony of a wife, and especially of an adoring wife like
Charlotte, would not have much weight with a jury. Nevertheless,
Lee resolved that if he was able to cast a doubt on Jocker
Stacey's "confession" he would advise Al to stand trial for the
murder of Jules Gar-trey. After all, Eliza Young was not a strong
character, and a first-rate lawyer, an honest lawyer, ought to be
able to break down her lies&mdash;and perhaps Agnes', too. Lee
thought: I have never yet helped to send a woman to the
chair&mdash;but why not, if she's guilty?</p>

<p>He was in Greenwich in ample time for the train and his
chauffeur parked the car with its nose to the station platform
where Lee, hidden in the back, could see all that went on. He had
newspaper photographs from which to identify Mrs. Craigin, but
they proved to be unnecessary for when the train came in, she got
off carrying the green box with its red stripe. Stout, good-natured,
capable, Irish, Lee approved of her looks. She was met
by a rather shabby but respectable man who had the appearance of
a servant on board wages. He led her to a station wagon parked
among the other cars. Lee said to his chauffeur:</p>

<p>"Follow the station wagon when it backs out."</p>

<p>But when the station wagon backed into the clear, he could
read the legend painted on its door: <i>Mount Pisgah</i>, and he
changed his order. "Let it go," he said. "On the empty country
roads they would soon get on to the fact that they were being
followed."</p>

<p>The station wagon turned away out of sight and Lee had himself
put down before a little cigar and news store opposite the
station. To the man behind the counter, he said:</p>

<p>"Do you know a place around here called Mount Pisgah?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Mister, the Estabrook estate; five miles north.
One of the biggest places in the county, but it's been closed up
for four-five years. The Estabrooks, they got places all over;
Palm Beach, Pinehurst, Bar Harbor, besides an apartment in New
York. They haven't been up here in a dog's age."</p>

<p>"Are there any servants on the place?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Matt Rennert and his wife, caretakers. Live in a
cottage just inside the gates. There are also the farm
employees."</p>

<p>"How do I get there?"</p>

<p>"Five miles out on the road to White Plains. Left-hand side.
You can't miss it. Hell of a big brick wall all around. There's
no other wall like it. Big iron gates with stone globes on top.
Brick cottage just inside. What's your interest in the place,
Mister?"</p>

<p>"I heard it was for sale."</p>

<p>"Gad! I wish they would sell. It would be nice for all of us
to see the place occupied again. Have you a permit to view
it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Then there's no manner of use you driving out there. Matt
Rennert won't admit nobody without they have a permit."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take a chance on it," said Lee.</p>

<p>He drove on out of the village. In the rolling countryside the
Mount Pisgah estate was immediately recognizable by its wall.
Seeing the entrance ahead, the chauffeur slowed down. The tall
iron gates were chained together and padlocked. Lee could see the
tracks of the station wagon where it had come out and gone in
again. Smoke was issuing from the chimney of the brick cottage
inside the gates, but there was nobody to be seen. The main house
was not visible. They proceeded.</p>

<p>The wall extended for about a quarter of a mile further along
the highway, then ran back at right angles. The enclosure was
laid out like an English park with thick screens of trees inside
the wall. Lee stopped his car.</p>

<p>"Somehow or other, I've got to get over that wall," he said.
"I haven't exactly the right figure for it."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a boost, sir," said his chauffeur. "I'll go
with you."</p>

<p>"No, you must stay with the car."</p>

<p>"How will you get out again, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if I can get in, I'll trust to luck to get out again.
Perhaps there are other gates."</p>

<p>Leaving the car, they walked along by the brick wall, only to
discover that it completely encircled the park. At the back,
there was a pair of high wooden gates leading out to the farm
fields. These looked a little easier to scale, but Lee would not
try it, fearing there might be somebody on the other side.
Instead, he had the chauffeur boost him to the top of the wall in
a place where the woods inside looked thickest. Perched on top of
the wall like Humpty-dumpty, Lee spoke down to the man:</p>

<p>"Go back to the car and keep driving around the roads in a
circle that will bring you past the front gates every half hour
or so."</p>

<p>He dropped to the ground inside the wall. It was not much of a
drop, but it shook him up a good deal. A tangle of undergrowth
and briars faced him; Lee was no woodsman, and after struggling
through it for a few yards he had to stop to wipe his face and
recover his breath. He discovered that his cheek was bleeding
from a thorn scratch and that the front of his overcoat was
liberally decorated with clinging weed seeds. This is no position
for a philosopher, he thought, picking off the seeds
halfheartedly. As soon as he started ahead he collected a fresh
crop.</p>

<p>He finally came out on a bridle path winding away right and
left through the trees. Turning to the right at random, he
plodded on in the twilight of the arching trees until he
discovered that he was coming up behind the cottage. Hastily
retreating, he took another path that forked to the right, and
presently the trees began to open up ahead. He could see a bit of
the main driveway with a wide lawn beyond. As he cautiously stole
toward the open, he heard the sound of a car coming and slipped
behind a big tree. The station wagon passed in the driveway,
heading back toward the cottage. Matt Rennert and Mrs. Craigin
were on the front seat. The woman no longer had the green box in
her lap.</p>

<p>After giving the car time to reach the cottage, Lee stole to
the edge of the trees to get his bearings. Evidently the
millionaire owners had been economizing on this place; only
enough work was done on it to keep nature in check. There were
some sheep pastured on the sweeping lawn. Off to the right the
trees closed in and the cottage by the gates was invisible. On
the left rose a great, square mansion in the Georgian style, its
mellow brick walls half-hidden under ivy. The front door and the
lower windows were boarded up; all the upper windows closely
shuttered. It gave the house a blind and deserted look.</p>

<p>Lee plodded in that direction, keeping within cover of the
trees as far as possible. Tracks in the drive indicated that the
station wagon had come from around the north side of the house
and Lee followed them. On this side, too, all the openings were
boarded up. There was a service door; Lee tried it only to find
it locked. He was not unduly discouraged, however, for he
distinguished threads of smoke rising from two of the rear
chimneys.</p>

<p>Passing around to the south side of the big house, he climbed
over a rough barrier erected to keep the sheep out. The gardens
were laid out on this side; a wide, formal garden, now much
neglected, and beyond it a private garden enclosed within thick,
tall, cedar trees. Making his way through an opening between the
cedars, he saw a baby carriage tucked into a sheltered corner and
smiled. Glancing under the hood of the carriage, he discovered
Master Alastair Yohe sleeping peacefully. The babe
stirred&mdash;it was his dinnertime&mdash;and Lee hastened to
take cover behind a spiraea bush. Alastair presently lifted up
his voice in a lusty cry of hunger, and Lee waited, smiling and
picking the seeds off his overcoat. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a rush of feet and Charlotte came
running through the hedge opening with an adorable expression of
anxiety. She looked as fresh and vivid as a bride. Lifting the
child, she pressed him to her breast, kissing him, murmuring:
"Did he think he was forgotten, poor lamb!" Lester, taking it as
a matter of course, stopped crying. Lee thought: He's too young
to appreciate his good fortune. Charlotte carried him out through
the opening and Lee followed, taking cover from bush to bush.</p>

<p>From around the corner of the tall hedge, he saw her mount the
steps of a side porch and disappear behind a door. Lee followed.
Since all the surrounding windows were boarded up, he had no fear
of being seen from indoors. Softly trying the door, he found it
unlocked. He went in, closing the door behind him noiselessly. He
was in a dark passage; light was issuing through an open door
ahead of him and he heard the sound of voices in there. He
presented himself in the doorway.</p>

<p>He saw a smallish room and bare, a housekeeper's room or
perhaps a servants' hall. There was a hearth with a cheerful fire
burning and a table set for a meal, lighted with candles.
Charlotte sat with her back to him, removing the baby's outer
wraps; beyond the table, Al in his shirt was sunk in an easy
chair with his slippered heels cocked on another, reading the
Sunday paper. Charming scene of domesticity!</p>

<p>Lee said: "Well, children?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. Charlotte, clutching the baby to her
breast, turned a face of terror; Al, dropping the paper, stared
openmouthed. The baby wailed, and Lee began to feel
self-conscious.</p>

<p>"It's no ghost," he said; "it's really me."</p>

<p>Al recovered himself. Springing up, he came around the table
and clapped both hands on Lee's shoulders, "Mr. Mappin! What a
swell surprise! You're just in time for lunch. It's a
celebration! We've got champagne and fresh caviar!"</p>

<p>"Really!" said Lee.</p>

<p>Charlotte was looking past Lee toward the open door. "Are
you...are you alone?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"Quite alone," said Lee. "Nobody has discovered your hide-out
but me, and I'm not going to tell."</p>

<p>"The police?..."</p>

<p>"I warned Inspector Loasby that if I found you I would keep it
to myself. If he didn't believe I meant it, that's his
lookout."</p>

<p>"How did you get in?" demanded Al.</p>

<p>"Over the wall and through the briars," said Lee, exhibiting
his seedy overcoat.</p>

<p>"What made you think you would find us inside?"</p>

<p>Lee described how he had followed the trail of the green
box.</p>

<p>Al struck a fist into his hand. "I ought to have known that my
gluttony would betray me!"</p>

<p>The worst of Charlotte's fears had subsided, but there was
still a doubt in her eye. "Why did you want to find us," she
asked, "if...if..."</p>

<p>Lee finished the question for her. "If I didn't mean to give
you away? Well, I'll tell you. I wanted to consult Al about the
best means of conducting his defense. I'm on his side now."</p>

<p>Al let out a whoop of joy and hugged Lee to his broad chest.
"Didn't I tell you we were going to get a break?" he shouted at
Charlotte. "I felt it coming this morning." He relieved his
spirits by kicking the Sunday newspaper around the room.</p>

<p>Charlotte came to Lee, bringing the baby. Tears stood in her
eyes. "I am so happy," she whispered. "I don't know how to thank
you. Lester wants to thank you, too. Kiss him."</p>

<p>The solemn baby looked at Lee with dark suspicion and Lee
said: "I'd rather kiss his mother."</p>

<p>Charlotte lifted her fresh and bloomy lips. "You're such a
dear!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Charlotte put Lester in his high chair and fed him while Al
toasted bread before the fire. He wasn't very good at it; he
talked too much. Al was in the highest spirits and talk spouted
from him like water from a 'fountain. Lee was oddly moved by the
scene; this is something I shall not soon forget, he thought; the
bare, candlelighted room and the little family; young husband,
handsome and confident, girl wife, adorable and adoring, and
their lusty babe.</p>

<p>Al was full of great plans for the future. He said: "As soon
as the cloud is lifted from my fair name, I'm going to invest my
little capital in a small hotel. Not in New York, no, by God! I'm
through with New York and its phony society. I thought of
Washington, D. C.; a hotelkeeper's paradise, where the transient
population grows like a mushroom bed. I've learned something
about feeding people; I will introduce really good food in
Washington..." et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>Presently they sat down to the table. The cork blew out of the
champagne bottle with a report like a pistol shot, and glasses
were filled. Al made outrageous jokes and Charlotte's silvery
laughter was heard continually. Lee thought it one of the
sweetest sounds in the world. Even young Lester became infected
with the general hilarity; he made rude male noises, bounced on
his fundament, and beat a spoon on his tray. Al elected himself
and Charlotte members of the Popsicle; i.e., those privileged to
address Lee as Pop. Lee could enter into their gaiety, but he was
too old to lose himself completely in the moment like the other
two. All the time in the bottom of his mind lay the anxious
thought: How can I save them?</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, they all took a hand in
clearing the table. Lester was carried out in the kitchen to keep
company with his mother; Al and Lee sat down by the fire to
discuss their business. Lee said:</p>

<p>"I see you get the newspapers. You read Jocker Stacey's so-called
confession yesterday."</p>

<p>Al nodded. "Made out of whole cloth, Pop. I never laid eyes on
Jocker Stacey nor passed a word with him in my life."</p>

<p>"So I supposed," said Lee, "or I shouldn't be here."</p>

<p>"His story was damn plausible!" said Al, scowling.</p>

<p>"Sure, it was plausible, because the scenes he described
really took place. All he did was to substitute your name for the
name of the person who actually hired him."</p>

<p>"How can we break his story down?"</p>

<p>"That's what I came to ask you about. He claimed that you
spent last Monday evening with him, that is, a week after the
murder, in Slater's poolroom on Grand Street."</p>

<p>"Suppose they bring forward habitues of Slater's who will
swear they saw me there talking to Jocker?" Al asked with a
sidelong look.</p>

<p>"They undoubtedly will," said Lee undisturbed. "It won't make
any difference to me. I know Slater's and the gang that hangs out
there. Where were you that Monday night?"</p>

<p>"At home with Charlotte and the kid. I never stirred out of
the flat."</p>

<p>"That's good so far as it goes," said Lee. "Unfortunately, the
testimony of a wife does not have much weight with a jury. A good
wife is expected to lie for her husband. Jocker said he met you
again on the following day at twelve noon in the Biltmore. Where
were you at that hour? I know you weren't home, for at twelve on
Tuesday I was watching the flat on Park Avenue."</p>

<p>Al considered. Suddenly he began to grin, checked it by biting
his lip, and glanced queerly at Lee. "I've got a perfect alibi
for Tuesday at noon, Pop, but..."</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how you're going to take it."</p>

<p>"What has it got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Pop," said Al appealingly, "blame me for it if anybody has to
be blamed. I could never forgive myself if the other party got
into trouble with you on my account."</p>

<p>"What other party?" said Lee irritably. "What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Fanny Parran," said Al.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Lee. Al was gazing in his face with a
ridiculous expression of anxiety. Lee started to laugh and the
young man's face cleared like the sun breaking through clouds.
"That's a good one on me," said Lee. "A week ago it would have
made me sore, but now I don't mind. I shall have to eat crow,
though, when I face Fanny, and that won't be so nice. What was
the occasion of your meeting Fanny?"</p>

<p>"Jules Gartrey's death caught Charlotte and me short of cash,"
said Al. "Charlotte had been to see Fanny before Tuesday. Fanny
said she knew a broker, and I conveyed five one-thousand-dollar
bonds to her to be sold. The meeting was to enable her to hand
over the cash for them."</p>

<p>"Where was the meeting?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"At Hanley's caf, a small place on Lexington Avenue, opposite
one of the entrances to the Eighty-sixth Street subway station;
the time 12:15. We met, had a drink together, she gave me the
money and we talked for fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Lee said: "It was on Tuesday that Jocker Stacey said you
handed him fifteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," said Al. "I gave Charlotte five
hundred and I have most of the rest on me. What I have spent I
can account for."</p>

<p>"Go on with your story," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Fanny left me at 12:30 and I called up the flat to see if the
coast was clear; no answer. I waited ten minutes, called up again
and was then satisfied that the police were in the place. So I
called you up, remember? 12:45 Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"Right, I can testify to that," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I then walked over to Second Avenue," Al continued. "I was
sore on account of our hide-out being discovered. Made me feel
naked, walking around the streets with a general alarm out for
me; I imagined everybody was staring at me. In a secondhand store
on Second Avenue, I bought a flat wicker basket and a grocer's
apron; I went into the cellar of an unoccupied house and hid my
hat and overcoat. I put on the apron and dirtied it, and roughed
up my hair. Out in the street I felt easier then. Nobody looks at
a grocer's boy. I bought some vegetables from a pushcart and
carried them in my basket. I walked down to the service entrance
of Miss Harley's apartment on Seventy-fourth Street. She was away
but I persuaded the cook, Rose Craigin, to take me in."</p>

<p>"I have heard about that part," said Lee dryly. "What time did
you arrive there?"</p>

<p>"One-thirty," said Al. "And remained there until about
three-thirty. Cook and I then walked over to the east side of the
park where we ran into Charlotte and gave her the money. That's how I
spent Tuesday. You and Fanny Parran, the waiter at Hanley's caf,
and the secondhand dealer all ought to be able to bear me out. I
may not be able to find the pushcart man again, but Mrs. Craigin
will testify for me and the other maid at Miss Harley's."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Lee. "I can also testify that two days
before Hawkins' murder you told me a story that corroborated his
at every point. You therefore had no motive for putting him out
of the way...When this comes out it will show me up in a bad
light," Lee went on ruefully, "assisting a fugitive from justice
and all that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Al.</p>

<p>"Well, I expect I can live it down. You need have no further
fear of Jocker Stacey's story. We can face him down in
court...Now about the other charge. Since the story of Charlotte
and the baby has been published, my lady Agnes is in a fine rage
against you."</p>

<p>"I never gave Agnes a thought," said Al, "but of course she
would be."</p>

<p>"She is determined to send you to the chair for the murder of
her husband. The question is, can she?" Lee went on to tell Al of
Agnes' latest story of Jules Gartrey's death.</p>

<p>"Like Jocker Stacey's story," said Al, "it's part true and
part false. When Agnes says she saw me standing over Gartrey's
body with the smoking revolver in my hand, that is a pure
fabrication. Why, Agnes got out in the foyer <i>before I
did</i>."</p>

<p>"Hey?" said the surprised Lee, "you didn't tell me that
before."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't want to be put in the position of charging
Agnes with the murder. Look what a light that would show me up
in!"</p>

<p>"But if it's a question of you or her?"</p>

<p>"I am not certain that she killed him."</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened and let me judge."</p>

<p>Al said: "There I was sitting in the boudoir while Agnes
changed her clothes. There are three doors in that room; all of
them were closed. Agnes and her maid were supposed to be in the
dressing room adjoining. Since the door from boudoir into
corridor was closed, I had no warning of Gartrey's coming; I
couldn't hear the elevator door; evidently Agnes did. I heard a
rush of feet through the corridor, then the shot."</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "That's pretty strong evidence."</p>

<p>Al shook his head glumly. "No. At first I thought so, but the
shot followed too quick. <i>Agnes did not have time to get out
into the foyer</i>."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Lee. "In that case there is further work to be done
on the case...Think back. <i>After</i> the shot did you hear the
sound of a door opening or closing?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you, Pop. I was too excited then. I thought
Agnes had shot herself. I hesitated. I didn't know what to do. I
ran out into the corridor and there she lay in a heap on the
floor. Her body was partly resting against the door into the
foyer. I felt utterly sick. But when I turned her over, I saw
that she had no wound on her and that there was no gun there. She
had only fainted. I then opened the door and saw Gartrey lying
dead in the foyer..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Lee. "Could Agnes have shot Gartrey and
then have got back into the corridor?"</p>

<p>"It is possible. But I am not sure of it. There was scarcely
enough time."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"When I saw Gartrey, my one thought was to get out of the
place. I stepped over Agnes and beat it. You know the rest."</p>

<p>Lee, stroking his chin, thought it over. "This killing is
still unexplained," he said slowly, "but, anyhow, I believe we
can get you off."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been you who ran out and shot Jules Gartrey
because your hands were bare. And there were no fingerprints on
the gun."</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried Al joyfully. "My gloves were in the pocket of my
topcoat and my topcoat was hanging in the closet!" He sprang up.
"Charlotte! Charlotte!"</p>

<p>She came running in, her pretty face all screwed up with
anxiety. "Oh, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Darling!" cried Al, spreading his arms wide. "Pop has found a
way to clear me! I knew he would! I knew he would!"</p>

<p>They embraced as if it was the first time they had come
together. It lasted so long that the bystander became
embarrassed. Afterward, Lee had to be embraced. Al popped another
bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>Lester was brought in and they all lined up in chairs before
the cheery fire.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" asked Al. "I promised, you know, to
give myself up to the police as soon as I had you on my
side."</p>

<p>"I believe it will be safe for you to give yourself up now,"
said Lee, "but wait for a couple of days; I want to do a little
work on the case: I want to prepare the way for you. I'll come
and get you when I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Al, "but don't leave us in suspense in this dark
hole. I am longing to see the sun again! You can write me and
enclose it in an outside envelope addressed to Matt Rennert,
Greenwich. The Rennerts call me Johnny Jones. It's just a fiction
because they know who I am."</p>

<p>"I'll write to you," said Lee. "At what hour is mail delivered
here?"</p>

<p>"Twice a day by R.F.D. at the gate; nine in the morning and
four in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"How can I get out of here unseen?" Lee asked. "I don't think
it would be prudent to let Mrs. Craigin and the Rennerts know
that you have had a visitor today."</p>

<p>"I'll unbar the farm gate for you," said Al. "There are no
laborers about on Sunday. You can reach the highway through the
fields."</p>

<p>"Don't go yet, Pop," Charlotte softly pleaded. "It is so good
for Al to have somebody to talk to beside a woman and a
baby."</p>

<p>"Have I complained?" said Al.</p>

<p>"No, darling. But I can see how cooped up you feel."</p>

<p>"I'm in no hurry to go," said Lee. "I am enjoying myself."</p>

<p><br> In due course Lee regained the highway unseen and walked
along. Hearing the approach of a car, he looked over his shoulder
and was somewhat disturbed to see the car behind him stop at that
moment. It backed around in the road and returned the way it had
come. This had a queer look. The car was a black sedan; it was
too far away for Lee to read the license number or to distinguish
the features of the man who was driving it.</p>

<p>A minute or two later his own car came along and picked him
up. "There was a suspicious-looking car..." Lee began.</p>

<p>"Sure; did it pass you?" asked his chauffeur.</p>

<p>"No. Came up behind and when it saw me, turned and went back.
That's what made me suspicious."</p>

<p>"Been hanging around all afternoon," said the chauffeur. "I
was going to tell you. Passed me just now doing about seventy.
Driver holding his head down so I couldn't get a good look at
him. Never did get a good look at him. Car had an Illinois
license plate. Looked like a fake plate to me."</p>

<p>"May be nothing in it," said Lee, "but anyhow, go back to
Greenwich and let me out at that little stationery store."</p>

<p>Lee was recognized in the store. "What did you think of Mount
Pisgah?" asked the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get into the place," said Lee, "I'll have to get a
permit and come again."</p>

<p>Lee bought a couple of sheets of paper and two envelopes. He
wrote:</p>

<p><br> Dear Johnny:</p>

<p>My chauffeur tells me there has been a black sedan hanging
about Mount Pisgah all afternoon. I can't quite figure it out. It
may be an enterprising newspaper reporter or a New York
detective; there is no great danger to be feared from either of
these now. On the other hand, never forget that you have powerful
and unscrupulous enemies. Watch yourself.</p>

<p>Pop.</p>

<p><br> Lee put this in two envelopes, addressed the outer to
Matthew Rennert, and bought a stamp. He dropped his letter in the
Greenwich post office and gave his chauffeur the word to return
to New York. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lee entered his office next morning, both
typewriters were clacking. Fanny and Judy greeted him politely
and went on with their work. The girls were still bearing
themselves coolly toward their employer, and Lee, however
exasperated he had felt, had not been able to get back at them,
for while they sent him to Coventry they took care to do their
work with extra care and thoroughness. In an unacknowledged war
of this sort the male is at a disadvantage. Today, however, the
end of the war was in sight, and Lee could afford to smile. To
plague the girls, he affected to be in great spirits.</p>

<p>"Good morning, girls! Lovely day, isn't it? I felt so good I
had to walk down."</p>

<p>Fanny and Judy smiled politely; said nothing. Lee saw them
exchange a questioning glance; what cause has Pop to feel so gay?
He went into his private office smiling inwardly.</p>

<p>When he had skimmed over his mail he called Fanny in. She
brought her notebook. "No dictation this morning," he said. "I
want you to do a little field work."</p>

<p>"Field work?" said Fanny, running up her eyebrows. "I didn't
know you had a case on hand."</p>

<p>Lee said: "I want you to go up to a little caf on Lexington
Avenue in the neighborhood of 86th Street. The name is
Hanley's."</p>

<p>Fanny's face didn't give anything away; she merely became
wary. "What am I to do there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Find, if you can, a waiter who was on duty at noon on Tuesday
last."</p>

<p>"Do you know his name?"</p>

<p>"No. Do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Fanny coldly.</p>

<p>Lee went on with an innocent air. "It is important, you see,
as a means of breaking down Jocker Stacey's testimony. I want to
find out if there is a man at Hanley's&mdash;if more than one
man, so much the better&mdash;who can go on the stand and swear
that you and Al Yohe were served there at noon last Tuesday."</p>

<p>Fanny broke down then. "Who told you that Al and I were
together last Tuesday?" she demanded. "Al did."</p>

<p>"When did you see Al?"</p>

<p>"Had lunch with him yesterday."</p>

<p>Fanny stared in confusion.</p>

<p>"You went to Hanley's to take Al some money," Lee went on,
"and I expect it will cause me a peck of trouble when it comes
out in court."</p>

<p>Fanny saw that she had been fooled and frowned; then she
perceived that the war was over and smiled. "Pop, you're a
devil!" she said. "I'd pull your hair&mdash;if you had any!"</p>

<p>Lee had his laugh out then. In the front office Judy looked
up, startled by the sound.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Fanny.</p>

<p>"It means that from now on this office is working night and
day on the case of Alastair Yohe until he is cleared!"</p>

<p>Fanny's pretty face flushed red with pleasure. "Oh, Pop!" she
cried, clasping her hands together. Notebook and pencil dropped
to the floor. "Oh, Pop, I'm so glad! Oh, I could hug you for
that!"</p>

<p>"Who's stopping you?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"Judy must know about this!" cried Fanny. "Judy! Judy! come in
here!"</p>

<p>Judy ran in. She was the more emotional. When she was told,
tears sprang in her big brown eyes. "Oh, Pop! Oh, Pop!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't turn on the waterworks!" cried Lee.
"Sit down! Smoke up! Let's have a little peace and comfort in the
shop again!"</p>

<p>"This is like old times!" said Fanny, happily blowing smoke.
"We can be happy in our work again!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't me spoiled it," said Lee. "By rights, I ought to
fire both of you for the way you've been acting the past two
weeks."</p>

<p>"But you were so stubborn, Pop!"</p>

<p>"I was not stubborn. I am a most reasonable man. I was only
prudent."</p>

<p>"Now that we're all reunited," said Fanny, "do you mind if I
telephone Tom Cottar? I've been mean to him lately. I'd like to
tell him everything is all right."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Lee.</p>

<p>Redheaded Tom turned up in the outer office in record time.
The stout fellow looked as if he had been put through the mill,
and when he came, Lee called Judy as if he wished to dictate a
letter and had her close the door between the two rooms. After
giving the pair five minutes to effect an armistice, Lee opened
the door and called them in. Tom looked made over; his homely
face was beaming. As they settled themselves, Fanny said to
Tom:</p>

<p>"Everything that is said in here is off the record."</p>

<p>"Ah, have I ever let you down yet?" said Tom, all ready to
have his feelings hurt again.</p>

<p>"Skip it," said Lee equably. "We all trust each other."</p>

<p>As they discussed the case from different angles, Lee and Tom
learned several things they had not known before; how little
Charlotte had come to Fanny in the first place to implore her to
use her influence in bringing Lee over to Al Yohe's side; how,
later, all four of them, Al, Charlotte, Fanny and Judy, had
plotted together to make it possible for Al himself to approach
Lee.</p>

<p>"Very reprehensible conduct!" remarked Lee, taking a pinch of
snuff.</p>

<p>Fanny flung an arm around his shoulders and gave him a
squeeze.</p>

<p>In summarizing the situation Lee said: "We have two separate
crimes to deal with; the first devilishly clever and well
planned; the second, a clumsy murder carried out on impulse and
immediately exposed. It is obvious they were not both conceived
by the same brain. We can clear Al of the Philadelphia charge,
but remember, he will be tried on the other first, and there is
still work to be done on that."</p>

<p>Fanny was assigned to cover the route that Al had taken on the
previous Tuesday to make sure of sufficient evidence to support
his alibi. Tom was advised to dog Harry Brummel's steps and to
interview him, if possible. It was not likely that the crafty
lawyer could be trapped into any dangerous admission; still, he
did not know how much Lee and his friends knew, and he might let
something fall that could be used to advantage.</p>

<p>"Kids, if we are able to show up that crooked attorney, we'd
be public benefactors," said Lee.</p>

<p>Judy, to her disgust, was required to keep the office for the
time being. Later, her job was to win the confidence of Jocker
Stacey's girl friend, Riqueta Seppi. Judy could play the part of
an East Side girl to perfection.</p>

<p>"Before Jocker discovered what a gold mine there was in this
case," said Lee, "he may have told the girl part of the truth. It
is possible that Agnes Gartrey herself saw Jocker and, if so, the
girl may be jealous. It would not be the first time that a great
lady had stooped to a handsome young gangster. In any case, try
playing on the girl's jealousy."</p>

<p>As to his own part, Lee said: "It is obvious that the final
solution of the problem lies in the Gartrey apartment, and I'm
going up there again."</p>

<p>They departed on their several errands. Lee did not telephone
his coming in advance to Agnes Gartrey, for he had a wish to see
what kind of reaction, if any, his unexpected arrival might have
on her household.</p>

<p>Denman admitted him to the apartment. This young man's smooth,
handsome face gave nothing away. In answer to Lee's inquiry, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Are you expected, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey has not been about yet, sir. I will have to ask
if she can see you."</p>

<p>He conducted Lee into the salon. He left the doors open when
he retired, and Lee made sure that he entered the corridor
leading to the bedrooms.</p>

<p>In a minute or two, Denman returned saying: "Mrs. Gartrey will
be happy to see you, sir, if you don't mind waiting a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Lee. To himself he added: I am still in
favor!</p>

<p>Denman softly crossed the foyer on his rubber-shod feet and
passed through the service door. The handsome young animal is
well housebroken, thought Lee. After waiting a moment he
noiselessly followed the servant. The door into the service
passage swung both ways and he went through it without making any
sound. At the end of the passage there was a door into the pantry
which usually stood open, and it was open now. Just within the
opening, Lee flattened himself against the wall.</p>

<p>As he had expected, Denman was at the telephone switchboard.
But Lee was not quick enough; the servant was almost finished
dialing; Lee heard only the last two numbers, 8 and 9. Then
Denman said softly: "Hello? Is this you?...Mappin is here."</p>

<p>Cheek! thought Lee. He heard half of a conversation:</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't expected, but Madam is going to see him. He's
waiting in the salon...I've tried that before and it's no good.
Mappin is too suspicious. He always lowers his voice when he has
anything important to say...All right, I'll do that...Good-by."</p>

<p>Lee slipped back through the swing door and regained his seat
in the salon. This was decidedly interesting. He didn't know who
Denman had called up, but he hoped that if he stuck around long
enough the results of the conversation might appear.</p>

<p>While he waited, Lee looked around the magnificent room with
its antique French furniture, Chinese porcelains and masterly
paintings. There was a Persian rug covering the whole floor which
must have cost a king's ransom. The paintings, he saw, were only
copies of the great masters, though good ones. Evidently an
expensive decorator had been given carte blanche in the apartment
before the Gartreys moved in. The whole effect was opulent rather
than tasteful. But quantities of fresh flowers lent grace to the
room.</p>

<p>Through open doors to the right, Lee looked into the music
room upholstered in blue brocade. He could see a corner of the
gold-encrusted grand piano standing between the windows. He
wondered at the folly of a woman who could stake all
this&mdash;against the death house.</p>

<p>Agnes Gartrey presently came floating toward him through the
music room, clad in a seductive negligee. This was a dove-gray
affair trimmed with bands of marabou. He had never seen her wear
the same garment twice. Her face was smooth and smiling.</p>

<p>"Such a pleasure to see you, Mr. Mappin!"</p>

<p>"Should I apologize for coming at this hour?"</p>

<p>"You need never apologize to me! Let us go into the boudoir. I
have a fire in there."</p>

<p>In the pink room they seated themselves and lighted
cigarettes. Lee declined a drink.</p>

<p>"Too early, dear lady."</p>

<p>"What's the news?" she demanded with a strained eagerness she
could not hide. "I hope you've come to tell me Al Yohe has been
caught."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"But surely the police have some clue to his whereabouts. His
pictures are published every day in the newspapers. Everybody in
the world knows what he looks like..."</p>

<p>Lee spread out his hands.</p>

<p>Agnes arose with a jerk and started pacing. "This is
disgraceful! Disgraceful! 'What's the matter with our police?
Heaven knows they cost enough! One man against thousands. And
what has happened to your great skill, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Running down a fugitive is a little out of my line," said Lee
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand this suspense!" she cried, pressing knuckles
to her temples. "I will never know peace of mind again until I
have seen that wretch punished. The thought that he and the woman
might eventually escape drives me mad!"</p>

<p>Lee wondered if the sleek Denman had his ear pressed against
one of the doors. "Better lower your voice," he warned.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, instantly obeying.</p>

<p>"Al and Charlotte cannot escape in the long run," said
Lee.</p>

<p>"That's not good enough," Agnes sullenly retorted. "I'm tired
of waiting for justice to overtake them. Obviously, somebody else
is hiding them now. Why don't the police offer a reward for their
capture? A reward big enough to tempt his fond friends?"</p>

<p>"The police have no fund for that purpose. A reward is usually
offered by a private person."</p>

<p>Agnes came to a stop, staring. "I've a mind to offer a reward
myself," she murmured.</p>

<p>Since Lee had already decided to bring Al Yohe in, this
suggestion struck him as humorous. Why not encourage it? However,
he kept a discreet silence.</p>

<p>"It must be a big reward," Agnes continued. "Five
thousand&mdash;no, ten thousand."</p>

<p>Lee thought: How she tosses money around! He said dryly:
"Surely ten thousand would be sufficient."</p>

<p>"All right," said Agnes, "I'll do it. It will square me with
the public. They half believe that I know where Al Yohe is. More
than once the newspapers have hinted that I am hiding him."</p>

<p>"But if you come forward as the donor of the reward," Lee
objected, "Al Yohe will be warned that you have turned against
him, and it will make him warier."</p>

<p>"That's right...What do you advise?"</p>

<p>"Let the reward be advertised as from an anonymous donor.
After Al Yohe is caught and lodged in jail, you can then come
forward and identify yourself as the donor."</p>

<p>"Good!" she cried. "How thankful I am that I have you to
advise me! Will you take care of the details? I'll write you a
check now. To whom should I make it payable?"</p>

<p>"To me," said Lee dryly. "I'll deposit it and give my check to
the Commissioner of Police."</p>

<p>Agnes instantly sat down at her desk. Handing the check to
Lee, she said urgently: "Lose no time! Lose no time!"</p>

<p>"It will be advertised in the evening papers," said Lee.</p>

<p>"What brought you here this morning?" Agnes asked.</p>

<p>Lee parried the question. "My dear lady, you are shaking like
a leaf! I recommend a spot of Scotch." Agnes shrugged. "And you?"
she said.</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>She rang for a servant, and by this little maneuver Lee gained
five minutes perhaps. Not until Denman had left the room for the
second time did she repeat her question:</p>

<p>"What did you want to see me about?"</p>

<p>Lee was ready with the answer. "After I left you the other
day, it occurred to me that there was a discrepancy in your
story..."</p>

<p>She broke in sharply: "You surely can't have any doubt as to
Al Yohe's guilt?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. But I don't want any holes to appear in the
evidence against him. You told me that you saw him standing over
poor Mr. Gartrey's body with the smoking gun in his hand..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There were no fingerprints found on the gun."</p>

<p>Agnes changed color. "I'm glad you brought that up," she said
quickly. "I forgot to mention that Al had a glove on his right
hand when I saw him. Only the one glove."</p>

<p>"What color glove?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a brownish color. Looked soiled."</p>

<p>"Had you seen that glove before?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. He had it hidden."</p>

<p>"Hawkins said that Mr. Yohe's gloves were in the pocket of his
topcoat when he hung it up."</p>

<p>"Surely. The other was a glove that Al had brought for that
special purpose."</p>

<p>Lee had now been in the apartment for more than half an hour;
nobody had come and Agnes had not been called to the telephone;
he still had no clue to Denman's telephone conversation. To gain
a little more time, he took Agnes over the whole story of the
shooting again. She became impatient and suspicious, and in the
end he had to take his leave unsatisfied. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">DOWNSTAIRS, he left by the front door of the
apartment house, turned the corner, and entered again by the
service entrance on the side street. In the basement there was a
corridor leading to a sort of waiting room. Here Lee was faced by
the service elevator. Behind it rose the service stairs in a
fireproof shaft. There were two youths on duty; one sat doing
nothing; the other in the elevator car was reading the latest
story of the Al Yohe case. Lee Mappin was known to both, and they
stood to attention. He addressed the elevator boy.</p>

<p>"Were you on duty at the time Mr. Gartrey was shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"I'd like to ask you a question or two." Lee always prefaced
such interviews with a generous tip. He slipped a bill to each
boy and they pocketed it with grins. It transpired that the
elevator boy was called Fred, and his mate was Bill. Lee
continued: "The butler Hawkins testified that Al Yohe escaped
down the service stairs. Did either of you boys see him?"</p>

<p>Fred answered: "No, sir. We didn't see him. According to the
women, Al left Gartreys' by the front door, and went down to Mr.
Deane's apartment on the second."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that story?"</p>

<p>Both young men grinned. "No, sir."</p>

<p>"Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Al did escape by the
service stairs, would it have been possible for him to get out of
the building without your seeing him?"</p>

<p>"It would be possible, sir," said Fred. "He could always place
the elevator by the sound of the doors. I can't see the stairs
from inside the car. As for Bill, here, he often has to answer
the house telephone, and that's around the corner of the
wall."</p>

<p>"The stairs are not much used, I take it."</p>

<p>"You might say that they was never used, sir. The stairs are
only if the elevator service breaks down or in case of a
fire."</p>

<p>Having started the boys' minds running in this direction, Lee
casually put the real question that had brought him down to the
basement. "I suppose both you fellows are acquainted with
Denman."</p>

<p>"Sure," they both answered. Fred added with a reminiscent
grin, "Denman is quite a fellow, quite a fellow!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" said Lee.</p>

<p>"He's a sport," said Fred. "I been out with him. When he's
dressed you would never take him for a servant; he looks like a
college boy and spends money like his old man was worth a
million. He has class!"</p>

<p>"He was only second man at the Gartreys' until Hawkins left,"
said Lee. "A second man doesn't draw much."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Fred. "Those rich folks will pay big for
a good-looking fellow with a figure like Jack Denman. Some guys
has all the luck! Jack always has money to spend."</p>

<p>"He was out of the house at the time Mr. Gartrey was shot,"
said Lee. "Do you remember him going out that day?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I remember him going out, because I thought afterwards
it was lucky for him he was out. I remember bringing him down in
the car shortly after three o'clock. He didn't go right out, but
hung around fifteen, twenty minutes gassing with Bill and me."
Fred turned to his mate. "Remember, Bill? He had a little bottle
of prime whisky and gave us a drink. Gee! I can taste it yet! We
all went back in the locker room and finished the bottle. It was
only a little bottle."</p>

<p>Lee kept a wooden face. "Is there any way by which you can get
from the service stairway to the front stairway?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Except through the basement here, or over the
roof."</p>

<p>Lee stroked his chin. Over the roof, he thought; sixteen
flights of stairs, a stiff climb! But if a man was nerved by a
deadly purpose, that wouldn't stop him.</p>

<p>"I get you!" said Fred excitedly. "You think maybe Al went up
the service stairs to the roof, then down the front stairs to Mr.
Deane's apartment! That's a new theory!"</p>

<p>"Something like that," said Lee, "but keep it to
yourselves...Will you take me up and let me see the roof?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>The elevator stopped at the sixteenth floor and Lee went up
the last flight of stairs on foot. Fred accompanied him, full of
curiosity. This house had been built before the setback style of
architecture came into vogue and it had no terraces or
penthouses. The roof presented nothing of interest; a huge water
tank and the entrances to the two stairways, that was all. Fred
explained that the roof was available to all the tenants in fine
weather, but nobody used it except the servants, for the tenants
were the sort of people who forsake New York as soon as the
weather becomes pleasant. Lee crossed the roof to glance down the
other stairway. Like the service stairway, it was of stone and
steel construction, contained within a fireproof shaft.</p>

<p>"Are the doors to the roof ever locked?" he asked. "No, sir;
there's no need of it because you can't get on this roof from any
other roof."</p>

<p>Lee looked all around in order to make sure of missing
nothing. The apartment house across the side street was of newer
construction and a little higher; it had a penthouse. On the
terrace in the sun sat an old lady in a wheel chair, all bundled
up against the cold. She was gazing at Lee with the liveliest
curiosity and impatiently clapping her hands. The hand clapping
brought a nurse or companion out of the house behind her. The old
lady issued an order, apparently, and the nurse went back. Lee,
his own curiosity aroused, waited to see what would happen. The
nurse returned with a pair of binoculars which the old lady put
to her eyes. Lee smiled. What a stroke of luck if...He waved to
the old lady in good will, and she waved back. He said to
Fred:</p>

<p>"It was two weeks ago today when Mr. Gartrey was shot. Do you
remember if it was a fine day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We was having a long spell of pleasant weather
then. I remember it by the funeral."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee.</p>

<p>They returned to the elevator.</p>

<p>Lee entered the fine apartment house across the street and
presented his card to the functionary in charge of the hall. Lee
had been written up so much of late, it was not necessary to
explain himself. The functionary was greatly impressed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Mappin, sir, this is an honor. Who would you be
wishing to see, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"What is the name of the old lady, an invalid, who occupies
the penthouse?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradford, sir."</p>

<p>"I want to send up a note to her."</p>

<p>There was a desk in an alcove off the hall, and Lee wrote:
"Would Mrs. Bradford be good enough to see Mr. Amos Lee Mappin
for a few moments? They just exchanged greetings from roof to
roof." He enclosed this in an envelope with his card and sent it
upstairs.</p>

<p>The answer was not long in coming down: "Mrs. Bradford would
be pleased to see Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>Lee was left waiting for some minutes in the pleasant living
room of the penthouse. The sun streamed in through a row of tall
French windows giving on the terrace. When the old lady was
wheeled in by her attendant, he saw the reason for the delay; she
had undergone a complete change of costume in preparation for her
visitor. She now wore a pretty silk dress with a lace shawl over
her shoulders and a silken coverlet over her knees. She had a
coquettish black bow in her white hair and a touch of rouge in
her withered cheeks; her eyes were bright with anticipation. She
carried a tortoise-shell fan&mdash;not that she needed a fan, but
merely as a becoming stage property. She extended her hand with
an air&mdash;undoubtedly she had been a great belle in her
youth.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Mappin. It is an event for me to have a
visitor&mdash;and especially such a distinguished visitor."</p>

<p>"The pleasure is mine, Mrs. Bradford," Lee said with his best
bow.</p>

<p>When the wheel chair was placed to her satisfaction, she
dismissed her attendant. She signed to Lee to seat himself close
to her.</p>

<p>"It was very naughty of you, sir, to wave to me from the roof
across the way!" She tapped his wrist with the closed fan and
sadly shook her head. "Ah, and it was much naughtier of me to
wave back again! It brought back old times for a moment. Do you
remember that story of de Maupassant's in which the little
Comtesse nodded to a strange gentleman from her window and he
came right upstairs? A dreadful story, and so true to life! But
you waved first! However, when one is as old as I, there is,
unfortunately, no danger!"</p>

<p>Lee said: "<i>L'esprit</i> never grows old, Mrs.
Bradford."</p>

<p>She shook her fan at him. "You have a beguiling tongue, Mr.
Mappin!...Seriously, the old have a thin time of it. People
forget that they exist. I am crippled with arthritis, as you see.
They carry me from my bed to my chair and from my chair back to
my bed again. Is that living? Sunshine is supposed to be
beneficial to me. I could go to Florida, but I will not live
among other invalids. They have warped minds. So my son took this
penthouse with a southern exposure and every fine day they wheel
me out on the terrace, and there I sit, doing nothing, seeing
nothing. I am too high up to see into the street. Before the
weather grew cold, it used to amuse me to watch the servants
spooning on the roof opposite, but nobody comes up there any
more. So you can imagine how interested I was when you appeared
on the roof a while ago. I must apologize for the rude way I
stared at you."</p>

<p>"I was flattered by your interest," said Lee, "and here I am,
you see!"</p>

<p>She tapped his wrist with the fan. Lee let her run on,
perfectly willing to play the game of 1890 philandering with her
because he could see that she was no fool. She knew that he had
an object in coming, and in the end she asked him plainly what it
was.</p>

<p>"It was the binoculars that gave me the idea," said Lee. "You
are perhaps in a position to do me a very great service&mdash;and
a service to others besides me."</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is, Mr. Mappin! I am consumed with
curiosity!"</p>

<p>"This is Monday," said Lee. "I am thinking of another Monday
two weeks ago. The sun was shining as it is today, but it was
later than now, say shortly after three o'clock. Can you remember
that afternoon?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford spread out her hands. "All my days are so
exactly alike! If there was something to fix that day in my
mind...!"</p>

<p>"Another man on the roof across the way."</p>

<p>"Why yes, of course!" she cried. "That was the last person who
appeared on the roof until I saw you today. He came out of one
door, crossed the roof and went through the other door."</p>

<p>"Can you be sure it was Monday?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," she said; "even so small a thing makes a big
difference in my afternoon...Yes, that was the afternoon I broke
a cup. My nurse brings me tea at four and I remember I was
telling her about the man I saw when the cup slipped off the
saucer and broke. Monday two weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Did you get a good look at the man?"</p>

<p>"I did. Through the binoculars."</p>

<p>"Would you recognize him if you saw him again?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradford," said Lee, "is your condition such that you
could appear in court to identify the man?"</p>

<p>The old lady clapped her hands on the arms of her chair and
partly raised herself. Her eyes widened like a child's. "Go to
court!" she cried, "Me? How wonderful! What a break in my dull
life! I would like to see anybody stop me from going to court if
I was wanted!"</p>

<p>"I would, of course, see that you were taken and brought home
in comfort," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I'll go if they have to carry me on a stretcher, Mr.
Mappin!"</p>

<p><br> After he had left Mrs. Bradford, Lee spent an hour
darting from place to place in taxicabs. First to the Fulton
National Bank to have Agnes Gartrey's check certified in case
that unstable lady changed her mind; then to his own bank to
deposit the check; to Police Headquarters to hand his own check
to Inspector Loasby and to give him the great news. To Loasby he
said:</p>

<p>"You and I will go up to Greenwich tomorrow morning and fetch
him down together&mdash;if a word of this gets out in advance, it
will spoil everything."</p>

<p>"It will not get out through me!" said Loasby.</p>

<p>Lee then drove up to his own office. Fanny had come in, having
satisfactorily performed her errand, and the two girls were
having a belated lunch. Lee dictated a letter.</p>

<p><br> Dear Johnny:</p>

<p>Everything is shaping up well. A ten-thousand-dollar reward
has been offered for your capture. This naturally will excite the
Rennerts. They are poor people and it is not fair to put so heavy
a strain on their loyalty. Tell Matt Rennert and his wife
immediately (if you can get word to them before they read the
papers, so much the better) that you have decided to give
yourself up and that they may have the credit for it. Tell them
that if they should try to take you in themselves, some smart guy
would be sure to horn in on the reward. Inspector Loasby and I
are coming up to fetch you at eleven o'clock tomorrow and they
can then hand you over and take a receipt for you.</p>

<p>Tell Charlotte that I have built up a pretty good case and
there is no cause to worry.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Pop.</p>

<p><br> Meanwhile, Lee had ordered a car with the driver he had
used on the previous day. To the driver he said:</p>

<p>"This letter must be dropped in the Greenwich post-office
before the mail goes out at four. You have a good hour and a
half. Should you be delayed and miss the mail, carry the letter
direct to Mount Pisgah and give it to somebody at the cottage
inside the gate."</p>

<p>Soon after the man had departed, the extras were out on the
streets, announcing the reward for information leading to the
capture of Al Yohe. It occurred to Lee that this would afford him
an excuse to call again at the Gartrey apartment. Stuffing one of
the papers in his pocket, he drove uptown.</p>

<p>Denman showed a little surprise upon seeing him so soon again.
He showed Lee into the salon and went away to consult his
mistress. Almost immediately he was back, saying:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey will see you, sir. Please follow me." This did
not suit Lee's plans at all. "You needn't trouble to show me,
Denman," he said offhandedly. "I know the way."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. Mrs. Gartrey is in the boudoir." Denman
turned back toward the pantry while Lee started through the music
room, keeping the tail of an eye on the servant. He lingered for
a moment, affecting to examine a picture. The moment the service
door swung to behind Denman, Lee ran across the foyer as fast as
his short legs would carry him and pushed the door open again. He
had pad and pencil ready. He was in time to hear Denman start
dialing. Concentrating all his attention on the job, Lee made
lines on his pad to suit...seven lines.</p>

<p>Denman got his connection at once. There was no greeting; the
servant merely said: "Mappin is back again." Lee, waiting to hear
no more, slipped back into the foyer. Here he came face to face
with Agnes Gartrey, who had come looking for him. Her eyebrows
went up to their highest. Lee, having got what he wanted, was not
in the least abashed.</p>

<p>"Denman," he said mysteriously; "I have noticed that whenever
I come here he always telephones the news to somebody. I was
trying to find out who it was."</p>

<p>"And did you?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"No. No name was mentioned over the phone." Agnes was disposed
to be angry. "I've had enough of this. I will question
Denman."</p>

<p>Lee did not greatly care&mdash;now&mdash;whether she did or
not; however, he said: "It would oblige me if you said nothing to
him. Leave Denman to me and I'll catch him out yet."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect who it was?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Lee lied in his blandest fashion. "I have no idea."</p>

<p>Agnes, suspicious, angry, puzzled, scarcely knew how to take
Lee. She said in an uncertain voice: "Will you come into the
boudoir?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, no," said Lee. He pulled the newspaper out of his
pocket. "I brought you this in order to show you that I had
executed your commission."</p>

<p>Agnes merely glanced at the headline. "I have seen it."</p>

<p>Lee guessed that she already had reason to regret her
precipitancy in offering the reward. "Well, then, we've nothing
more to do except to wait for results," he said cheerfully.
"Good-by, dear lady."</p>

<p>Agnes offered him a limp hand. Her glance was baleful.</p>

<p>In a taxicab, Lee figured out the telephone number from the
lines on his pad. It ran thus: 12-6-6689. The first two numbers
stood for the first letters of the exchange; the third number was
the key number of the exchange; the last four digits represented
the actual telephone number. Back in his office he consulted a
card listing all the exchanges and their key numbers, and it
worked out thus: BEaver 6-6689. Lee smiled. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">AT half past nine next morning, Lee Mappin and
Inspector Loasby, accompanied by two plain-clothes men, were on
their way to Greenwich in a discreet limousine which displayed no
police insignia. Lee's hired car followed in order to provide
Charlotte and the baby with a more private means of
transportation back to town. It was a fine, still day, and the
four men were in good spirits, particularly Loasby. The case
which had threatened to wreck his career was as good as solved.
During the long drive the conversation dealt with police work in
general; the Al Yohe case was scarcely mentioned. Lee was not
acquainted with Loasby's two men and, always fearful of a
premature leak to the press, he did not care to expose his
hand.</p>

<p>They were evidently expected at Mount Pisgah; Matt Rennert and
his wife hastened to open the tall gates when they drew up before
them. Lee's letter had been received in time. So far, so good.
The Rennerts, simple, honest workers, were pale and slightly
tremulous with excitement; they could scarcely believe in their
good luck. They were invited to get into the second car and the
two cars drove on through the woods and around the edge of the
neglected lawn to the mansion.</p>

<p>Leaving the cars in the drive, the whole party walked around
to the south front and passed through the main garden into the
private enclosure. Lee smiled, seeing the baby carriage tucked in
the sheltered corner of the cedars: nothing was to be allowed to
interfere with young Lester's routine. Charlotte came running up.
She was dressed for town but her face was drawn with anxiety.</p>

<p>"I'm so worried about Al!" she said.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Lee sharply.</p>

<p>"Gone out."</p>

<p>"Gone out?"</p>

<p>Loasby's face turned grim. Al Yohe had slipped through his
fingers so many times!</p>

<p>"Didn't he get my letter yesterday afternoon?" asked Lee
sternly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pop, but another letter supposed to be from you came
this morning. It countermanded your previous instructions."</p>

<p>"I wrote no such letter!"</p>

<p>"I have it here," said Charlotte, opening her palm and
revealing a crumpled paper. "Read it! Read it!"</p>

<p>Lee read the typewritten page:</p>

<p><br> Sunday night.</p>

<p>Dear Al:</p>

<p>Since I saw you today there have been some awkward
developments. I can't stop to explain them now. I'll tell you
when I see you. The police have been tipped off to your hide-out
and you must make a quick getaway. I have found a new hide-out
for you, absolutely safe. You will receive this about nine
o'clock. Proceed immediately through the farm gates, past the
farm buildings of Mount Pisgah, and along the farm road to the
outer pasture. You will find a car waiting for you there. You can
trust the chauffeur. I can't come myself because I'll be busy
pulling wool over the eyes of the police. There's a gate from the
pasture to a little-used public road. The chauffeur will bring
you to me. Lose no time and don't worry about Charlotte and the
kid. The police have nothing on her. Later on, I'll arrange to
have her join you.</p>

<p>Yours in haste,</p>

<p>L. M.</p>

<p><br> The initialed signature was penciled in a good imitation
of Lee's hand.</p>

<p>"This is a fake!" cried Lee. "I don't address Al in that
manner nor do I sign myself like that. Every word smells of
deceit!"</p>

<p>"I know," said Charlotte piteously. "Al thought so, too."</p>

<p>"Then why did he go?"</p>

<p>"He thought he might be able to discover the identity of the
real criminal and perhaps capture him."</p>

<p>"Oh, the young fool!" groaned Lee.</p>

<p>"He was armed," Charlotte continued. "He promised to be
careful. He said he'd take a couple of the farm boys with him. I
couldn't stop him."</p>

<p>"How long has he been gone?"</p>

<p>"More than an hour. I have been so..."</p>

<p>From far off in the still air came the sound of a shot.
Charlotte caught her breath on a gasp. The whole group stood
transfixed. There were two louder reports close together, another
sharp one, and after a pause two more heavier reports.
Charlotte's face turned paper white; she reeled on her feet and
Lee caught her.</p>

<p>"Quick! to the car!" he cried to Loasby. "Follow the drive
around the house and straight back to the farm gates!"</p>

<p>Lee handed the fainting girl over to the care of Mrs. Rennert
and ran after the policemen. They piled into the car and let her
out, turning the corner of the house on two wheels, speeding
straight back between vegetable and fruit gardens. The farm gates
stood open and they dashed through at seventy miles an hour.
Outside, the well-cared-for fields of Pisgah spread wide before
them; there were no humans in sight. They flew past the farm
buildings without slackening speed and over a rough farm road
beyond, springs leaping, body pounding on the chassis. Lee was
grinding his teeth in mixed anger and apprehension. He had not
realized before how deeply the scapegrace Al, with his beguiling
smile and his gaiety, had crept into his affections&mdash;not to
speak of Charlotte and the baby.</p>

<p>They banged across a little wooden bridge and climbed a long
rise. Rounding a clump of woods, they came upon three figures
walking in the road, and the driver ground to a stop with
screaming brakes. Al Yohe, with a sheepish grin, was walking in
the middle, a young farm laborer on either side of him. Lee was
the first out of the car.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Not a scratch!" said Al.</p>

<p>Lee, conscious of a sudden weakness, sat down on the running
board and wiped his face.</p>

<p>"Where's the man you came to meet?" demanded Loasby.</p>

<p>"Vamoosed," said Al, grinning wider.</p>

<p>After their big scare, the members of the rescue party felt a
little sold. "Well...get in and let's go back," said Loasby
gruffly.</p>

<p>The car turned around and they climbed in. The farm workers
stood on the running board and dropped off when they came to the
barn. Inside, Al told his story.</p>

<p>"On the way out I stopped off at the barn and persuaded these
two fellows to go with me. I had an automatic and they took their
shotguns. Not much good for two-legged game. We proceeded
cautiously by the farm road. Couldn't see anything until after we
had crossed the brook and climbed the hill beyond. The pasture is
the last field on the farm. It's hidden by trees until you come
to the fence. When we got there we could see a black sedan
standing at the other side of the field, but there wasn't anybody
in it, nor anywhere around, so far as we could see. There are
woods to the east and the south of the pasture and we thought
they might be hidden there, so we made a detour through the
middle of the field where nobody could steal up on us. Luckily
for me, there is a ditch running through the middle of the
pasture.</p>

<p>"Suddenly we heard the crack of a shot from the car and a
bullet pinged through my hat and carried it off. A near thing,
that. We dropped flat and the boys let go with their cannons. I
held my fire because I couldn't see anything. The bastard must
have been crouching behind the engine hood, firing over the top.
He fired again and I scrambled for the ditch and rolled into it.
It was me he was shooting at. When he saw he couldn't reach me,
he climbed in his car and drove across the pasture hell for
leather, out through the gate and east on the public road. The
boys banged away again, but their pellets wouldn't make a scratch
at that distance. Stout fellows, those two. I must remember to
give them a present. There was only one man in the car. Whoever
he was, he played a lone hand. Damn good shot. What had he to
gain by croaking me, Lee?"</p>

<p>Lee said: "He knows enough to realize that if you are arrested
the whole truth is bound to come out and that it will spell his
finish."</p>

<p>Al judged from Lee's expression that it would be wiser not to
ask any more questions while there were so many listeners. "Who's
got a cigarette?" he asked. "In my excitement, I left mine."</p>

<p>Lee offered his case. "You got off easier than you deserved,"
he said dryly.</p>

<p>There was a joyful reunion when they returned to the mansion.
Charlotte, careless of the onlookers, flung herself into Al's
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, you frightened me so! You frightened me so!" she
scolded.</p>

<p>Al soothed her. "I'm sorry, Charlie!" He glanced at Lee.
"Seems like I made a fool of myself all round." The irrepressible
grin broke through. "But how could I refuse a dare like
that?"</p>

<p>The reunion was immediately followed by a tearful parting.</p>

<p>"Let's get going," said Loasby.</p>

<p>Al went with the police officers in the first car; Lee
accompanied Charlotte and the baby in the second. Charlotte
sternly called in her tears and talked about other things during
the long drive to town. Her determination to be brave almost
brought the tears to Lee's unaccustomed eyes. She weakened only
once.</p>

<p>"Will they put him in a cell, Pop?"</p>

<p>"I'll have him out in a couple of days, Charlie."</p>

<p>"Will they let me see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear."</p>

<p>Lee took her to her own flat on Park Avenue. Fanny Parran was
waiting there. The two girls fell into each other's arms weeping,
and Lee felt better. Charlotte would be all right now, he was
sure, and he left them.</p>

<p>By two o'clock, Al was safely lodged in Police Headquarters
without having been recognized by a single person on the way
there. An hour or so later, newsboys in the streets of every city
in the country were screaming the terrific news that Al Yohe had
been arrested. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">ON the following morning Judy Bowles reported to
Lee that she had succeeded in making friends with Jocker Stacey's
girl, Riqueta Seppi. From the feeling evinced by the girl against
Agnes Gartrey, Judy deduced that there had been meetings between
Agnes and Jocker Stacey, but Judy did not believe that Riqueta
could ever be induced or forced to tell the truth. The golden
rewards dangled in front of Jocker and his girl were too
potent.</p>

<p>Lee said: "It doesn't much matter now. If we can clear Al of
the first charge, the second will fall of its own weight."</p>

<p>The case had now to be turned over to the District Attorney.
Agnes Gartrey was the principal witness against the accused, and
the District Attorney was so impressed with her wealth and social
position that he announced, "in consideration of Mrs. Gartrey's
recent bereavement," he would examine her in her own home on
Wednesday afternoon. Inspector Loasby and Lee Mappin were invited
to be present. The press, of course, was excluded. When this news
was received in Lee's office, both girls looked at him
longingly.</p>

<p>"I might take one of you as my secretary," said Lee, "but I
would have no excuse for bringing both."</p>

<p>"Take Judy," said Fanny quickly.</p>

<p>"Take Fanny," said Judy.</p>

<p>"Flip a coin for it," said Lee.</p>

<p>Fanny won the toss.</p>

<p>The whole party arrived simultaneously at the Gartrey
apartment. The District Attorney, a youngish man, very conscious
of the importance of the occasion, brought two of his assistants
and a male stenographer; Inspector Loasby had two of his men. All
three of the police officers were in civilian clothes. Lee took
Fanny. They were all received in the foyer by George Coler. He
was almost as great a figure in the public eye as Mrs. Gartrey.
He introduced himself to the officials as Mrs. Gartrey's business
man and her closest friend. Coler had never appeared to better
advantage. His air of grave friendliness was perfect. He showed
the gentlemen into the salon and went away to fetch Agnes.</p>

<p>The scene appealed to Lee's sense of comedy. The curtains were
drawn and lamps lighted; this was for the benefit of Agnes'
complexion. Eight soberly clad men were sitting around on
satin-covered chairs, all trying to look important and at their ease,
and failing. From the D.A. down, they were a bit overwhelmed by
the evidences of wealth and luxury that surrounded them. As
usual, the big room was bedecked with quantities of roses,
delphiniums, snapdragons, chrysanthemums. The D.A. produced a
cigarette with a thoughtful air, tapping it on the back of his
hand. But he had not nerve enough to light it and put it away,
still thoughtful. He attempted to start a conversation with the
Inspector, but it languished and died. As the silence lengthened
out, their self-consciousness increased. Like a funeral, thought
Lee&mdash;but whose funeral? Fanny had disappeared.</p>

<p>Agnes kept them waiting a good while in order to heighten the
effect of her entrance. Finally she came through the music room,
leaning on George Coler's arm. She had probably never looked
handsomer. Made up to appear pale and romantic, she kept raising
her beautiful eyes helplessly to Coler's face, and Lee bit his
lip to keep from grinning. Her clinging costume of black and gray
chiffon was exquisite. All the men sprang up at her entrance and
obsequiously bent their necks. Agnes, perceiving the effect she
had upon them, became slightly contemptuous. She was too stupid
to comprehend the real danger of her situation, Lee thought, but
Coler was aware of it. He was keeping a strong hold on
himself.</p>

<p>Agnes, clinging to Coler's arm and glancing fondly in his
face, said: "Mr. District Attorney, is there any objection to
having my friend, Mr. Coler, present? He has no evidence to give,
but I should be so thankful to have his support."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mrs. Gartrey."</p>

<p>Lee wondered what this public avowal of a fondness for Coler
portended. The butterfly dartings of Agnes' mind were
unpredictable. Coler, who loved her, ought to have been overjoyed
by her present attitude, but if he was, he didn't show it.</p>

<p>Agnes dropped gracefully in a love seat on the District
Attorney's right. All the men resumed their chairs. Coler drew up
a chair behind Agnes. The District Attorney looked around.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you require?" asked Agnes languidly.</p>

<p>"A small table for my secretary, if you please." He pointed to
a little table against the wall and the secretary moved toward
it.</p>

<p>Agnes arrested him with a graceful gesture. "Don't trouble
yourself, please." She looked at Coler and he pressed a button in
the wall behind him.</p>

<p>Denman entered. "Remove the things from that table," said
Agnes, "and place it before the District Attorney's
secretary."</p>

<p>It was done. The manservant was visibly longing to remain in
the room, but Agnes dismissed him. "Close the doors when you go
out, and also the doors into the music room."</p>

<p>When the second pair of doors closed, she settled her bracelet
and said: "Now, Mr. District Attorney."</p>

<p>He bowed. "Please tell the story in your own way, Mrs.
Gartrey. I am distressed that I have to subject you to this
ordeal, and I want to make it as easy for you as I can. Take your
own time."</p>

<p>Agnes' eyelids flickered with contempt. She began languidly to
tell the same story that she had told Lee, rounding it out with
small added details here and there. Everybody listened with
sympathetic attention. She told how she had seen Al standing over
the body of her husband with the smoking gun in his hand; how he
had dropped the gun and fled; she did not forget to mention this
time that Al had a glove on his right hand. If this story stood
up in court, a jury would have no choice but to send Al Yohe to
the chair. However, this was not the courtroom and Lee quietly
bided his time.</p>

<p>The District Attorney made no attempt to pin her down or to
question any part of her story. There was no reminder that she
had in the beginning told an entirely different story.
Occasionally Agnes' eyes strayed to Lee's face, but Lee was
taking care to look as bland as milk. Satisfied as she went on
that she was creating a perfect effect, the hint of a satisfied
smirk appeared around her beautiful lips. She is enjoying
herself, God forgive her! thought Lee. When she had come to the
end, Agnes said:</p>

<p>"As long as you are here, would you like to hear my maid's
story? She was with me throughout that terrible afternoon."</p>

<p>"If you please, Mrs. Gartrey."</p>

<p>Denman was therefore summoned and sent to fetch Eliza Young.
While they waited for Eliza, Agnes refreshed herself with a
cigarette, but none of the men ventured to light up.</p>

<p>Eliza's large, pale face was damp with excitement and the
pince-nez kept slipping down her nose. The presence of Lee in the
room made her nervous. But nobody interrupted her; nobody
questioned any part of her story, and she came through all right.
She corroborated her mistress' story at every point.</p>

<p>After Eliza had been dismissed, the District Attorney arose to
make a little speech. "I don't think we need trouble you any
further, Mrs. Gartrey. Permit me to thank you for your co-operation
and to compliment you on the absolute clearness of your
story. May I also express my deepest sympathy..."</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a knock on the door. "Excuse me," said
Agnes. "Come in!"</p>

<p>It was the golden-haired Fanny Parran. Everybody stared. Fanny
said: "Excuse me, Mr. Mappin. Mrs. Bradford is here."</p>

<p>"Who is this person?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"My secretary," said Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"And who may Mrs. Bradford be?"</p>

<p>"That requires a word of explanation. Mrs. Bradford is a very
old lady who lives across the street. She has some evidence to
give in this case. It hasn't anything to do with Mrs. Gartrey's
story, but as Mrs. Bradford is a cripple, I have taken the
liberty of bringing her to the District Attorney in order to save
her the fatigue of a journey downtown. Perhaps her evidence is of
no importance, but I assume the District Attorney will have to
listen to it sooner or later."</p>

<p>"It's all right with me," said the District Attorney, "if Mrs.
Gartrey has no objection."</p>

<p>Agnes moved her shoulders pettishly. "I think I might have
been consulted in advance. Is my house a railway station?"
Everybody except Lee looked alarmed. "Oh, well," Agnes went on,
"as long as she's here, bring her in."</p>

<p>Fanny wheeled Mrs. Bradford into the room in her chair. In a
smart hat and a short fur jacket the old lady was very modish.
Her eyes were starry with excitement. She waved her hand gaily in
Lee's direction and bowed to Agnes as to an equal. Agnes stared
at her rather rudely, but Mrs. Bradford was not at all put about
by that. She took in everything and everybody in the room.</p>

<p>The District Attorney invited her to tell him what she knew
about the Gartrey case and she launched forth on her story. She
told him all about her arthritis; how good her son and his wife
were to her; and how dull life was, nevertheless, for an invalid.
The District Attorney had not Lee's patience. He began to fidget
on his chair and finally signed to her to stop. He said to Lee
sarcastically:</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, you are responsible for this witness. I can't see
how her story applies to the case we are investigating. Perhaps
you can bring it out&mdash;if there is any connection."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford looked affronted and then smiled at Lee. "It is
so much easier to deal with a gentleman!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradford," said Lee, "where do you live?"</p>

<p>"In the penthouse of the apartment across the street, Mr.
Mappin."</p>

<p>"From the terrace of the penthouse can you overlook the roof
of this house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The roof of this house is about all I have to look
at."</p>

<p>"I ask you to cast back in your memory to Monday afternoon two
weeks ago, November 3rd."</p>

<p>All the listeners in the room pricked up their ears as he
named the day Jules Gartrey was shot.</p>

<p>"Can you remember that afternoon?" asked Lee. "Yes, sir.
Perfectly."</p>

<p>"What happened to fix that particular afternoon in your
mind?"</p>

<p>"I saw a man on the roof of this house. He came out of one
door, crossed the roof and went through the other door."</p>

<p>The District Attorney intervened. "How can you be sure that it
was that particular afternoon instead of another?"</p>

<p>"Because I broke' a teacup that afternoon," said Mrs. Bradford
coolly. "I happened to be telling my nurse about the man I had
seen when the cup slipped from my hand."</p>

<p>Lee resumed his questioning. "Are you able to fix the hour at
which you saw this man?"</p>

<p>"I can fix it almost exactly, Mr. Mappin. My nurse brings me
my tea at four and it was about half an hour before she came that
I saw the man. I remember using those words to my nurse: 'Half an
hour ago I saw a man on the roof across the way.' So it was about
half past three. The same nurse is with me. You can ask her if
you distrust my memory."</p>

<p>"That will hardly be necessary," said the District Attorney
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradford," said Lee, "there are nine gentlemen in this
room. I would like to have you look around and see if you can
pick out the man you saw on the roof of this house at half past
three on the afternoon of November 3rd."</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted the District Attorney. "How could
she possibly identify a man that she had only seen across the
street?"</p>

<p>"I looked at him through my binoculars," said Mrs. Bradford
sharply. "That brought him right close."</p>

<p>"Proceed, please."</p>

<p>The old lady, enjoying her moment in the limelight, looked
slowly from one man to another. Each man became self-conscious in
his turn. She smiled coquettishly at Lee. "It certainly wasn't
you, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Eliminate me," said Lee.</p>

<p>After she had looked at them all, her glance returned to
George Coler. "The gentleman in the corner," she said, "I can't
see him very well. The light is poor."</p>

<p>The District Attorney smiled as one who humors the vagaries of
a very old person. "Would you mind standing, Mr. Coler?"</p>

<p>Coler stood up. His face was like a mask.</p>

<p>"That is the man," said Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>The silence of stupefaction fell on the room. Coler's face
turned brick red and his eyes bulged. "It's a lie!" he burst
out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford drew herself up. "I beg your pardon, sir!"</p>

<p>Coler struggled hard to regain his poise. "I'm sorry," he
said. "I did not mean to imply that you were making a
misstatement, but only that you were mistaken." He tried to carry
it off with a laugh. "On the afternoon in question I was engaged
in my business as I am every afternoon. I have never been on the
roof of this house. I have never been on any roof since I was a
boy."</p>

<p>"You are the man I saw!" said Mrs. Bradford firmly.</p>

<p>Coler looked at Lee and laughed again. "This is a farce staged
by the clever Mr. Mappin!"</p>

<p>It was an error in tactics, for all the policemen and the
attorneys in the room were familiar with Lee's work in
criminology. They began to think there was something in the old
woman's story. Lee was looking at Agnes. Her air of complete
astonishment satisfied him that she had never known the truth.
She had really believed that Al Yohe shot her husband and had
embroidered her evidence only to make certain of his
conviction.</p>

<p>Fanny started to wheel Mrs. Bradford from the room. Lee shook
hands with the old lady. "Thank you," he said gravely. "You have
served justice today."</p>

<p>"Will I be called upon to testify in court?" she whispered
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt."</p>

<p>The District Attorney was in a state approaching
consternation. "I don't understand," he said. "What does this
mean, Mr. Mappin? Are you suggesting that Mr. Coler should be
arrested for this crime?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Lee calmly. "Certainly not on such
inconclusive evidence. Mr. Coler is one of the most prominent
citizens of New York. He's not going to run away. Should any
explanations from him be required later, I'm sure he'll be glad
to satisfy you at any time."</p>

<p>Coler was not deaf to the ironic intonations in Lee's voice,
and his glance was poisonous. He laughed again. "This is the most
preposterous thing I ever heard of!" With a glance at Agnes, he
tried to draw her into his laughter, but Agnes was stony and
dazed.</p>

<p>"Please take me to my room," she whispered. They went out
together.</p>

<p>The men got out of the apartment as best they could. Loasby
whispered to Lee:</p>

<p>"Is it wise to let them go free?"</p>

<p>"What else can we do?" said Lee.</p>

<p><br> An hour later Lee and the District Attorney were sitting
with Inspector Loasby in the latter's private office when word
came over the teletype of a shocking accident in the neighborhood
of Fort Lee. A Cadillac sedan had been driven at full speed over
the edge of the Palisades, evidently with suicidal intent, and
had smashed on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, word came that the two occupants of the
sedan had been identified from papers on their persons as George
Coler, President of Hasbrouck and Company, and Mrs. Jules
Gartrey.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you!" cried Loasby.</p>

<p>"It was the cleanest way out," said Lee. "Far better than the
poison of a long-drawn trial." </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">"THE circumstances were such," Lee said to the
District Attorney, "that Al Yohe believed Mrs. Gartrey had shot
her husband and Mrs. Gartrey believed that Yohe had done it."</p>

<p>"How could that be, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gartrey was in her dressing room. We must assume that
she had left the door into the corridor open as a precaution. She
heard the elevator door open, and ran out with some idea of
preventing Gartrey from discovering that Al was in her boudoir.
But the shot was fired before she reached him and she fell
fainting in the corridor. A moment later, Yohe found her lying
there. She must have come to as soon as Yohe ran back to the
service entrance, and, finding him gone, drew the natural
conclusion. When she heard the butler coming, she ran into the
music room."</p>

<p>"Where was the lady's maid then?"</p>

<p>"She was still in the dressing room, paralyzed with terror,
one may suppose. She didn't appear in the foyer until after her
mistress came out of the music room."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin," asked the District Attorney, "when did you begin
to suspect that George Coler was guilty?"</p>

<p>"It was a matter of slow development," said Lee. "In the
beginning I was convinced, like everybody else, that Al Yohe was
the murderer. It was not until after Al had forced himself into
my presence and told me his story that I began to doubt."</p>

<p>"What put the doubt into your mind?"</p>

<p>"The fact that Al Yohe's story absolutely coincided with that
of Hawkins, the butler. I was already satisfied that Hawkins was
telling the truth. I then re-examined the stories told by the
different inmates of the Gartrey household, and in some cases I
questioned them myself. I questioned Mrs. Gartrey and the maid,
Eliza Young, on several occasions. All this testimony satisfied
me at length that neither Al Yohe nor Mrs. Gartrey could have
done it.</p>

<p>"It was then necessary to find another culprit and for some
days I was stumped. There was an effort to cast suspicion on the
butler, Hawkins, but that wouldn't hold up for a moment. Eliza
Young, too, was obviously incapable of such an act. All the
testimony agreed that, saving these four, there was nobody near
the spot when Mr. Gartrey was shot. The manservant, Denman, whose
actions in other respects were suspicious, was in a watchmaker's
shop when it happened. And how could any other person have got
into a house so well guarded both front and rear by hall men and
elevator operators? All these employees asserted that no
unexplained person had entered the house previous to the
murder.</p>

<p>"I was helped a good deal by a story told me by one who was in
Mr. Gartrey's confidence. This person's name has never been
mentioned in connection with the case, and I see no object to be
gained by mentioning it now. The story gave me a picture of the
situation that existed in the Gartrey household at the time of
the murder. Mr. Gartrey was aware of his wife's infidelities.
Indeed, she took little care to hide them, she was so sure that
he would put up with anything rather than submit to the ordeal of
a second ugly scandal in his domestic life. In this she was
wrong, for Mr. Gartrey had made up his mind to divorce her. She
had offered to go to Reno and divorce him without scandal in the
customary manner, but had demanded so great a price that he
refused to pay it. He had settled a very large sum on her at the
time of their marriage. His suspicions settled on Al Yohe and, in
order to conceal his hand, he befriended the young man. He even
lent him a large sum of money on mortgage to decorate his night
club. He had employed private detectives to watch his wife, but
nothing came of that. He then paid one of his servants, this same
Denman that I have spoken of, to call him up on the private phone
at his office to inform him whenever Mrs. Gartrey received a
gentleman visitor.</p>

<p>"When I asked myself: Who profited by Mr. Gartrey's death? the
answer immediately presented itself&mdash;George Coler. Upon the
death of Mr. Gartrey, Coler succeeded to the immense financial
power that the older man had wielded in Wall Street. Furthermore,
I presently discovered that Coler was in love with the beautiful
Mrs. Gartrey. I then scented a devilish plot by which Coler had
sought to remove both men who stood between him and his desire.
But I had no evidence, no evidence. It was easy to establish that
Coler was not in his office when Mr. Gartrey was shot, but how
could he have got into the apartment house, guarded as it was at
all times by hall men and elevator operators? Coler was well
known to all these employees. At this point, a highly significant
fact developed. <i>Nobody telephoned for Coler after the murder,
yet he was one of the first to turn up at the apartment after it
occurred.</i></p>

<p>"Judging from what happened, Denman must have called up Mr.
Gartrey shortly after three o'clock on November 3rd and told him
that Al Yohe was in the apartment. Mr. Gartrey, greatly agitated,
called for Coler, who was in his confidence. Coler's secretary
reported that her employer had left shortly before. Note the word
"left." If Coler had gone out she would naturally have said so.
The word "left" signifies that she did not expect him back again.
Mr. Gartrey must then have driven directly home. He arrived there
at three-forty. He had no murder in his heart because he was not
armed. All he was after was evidence.</p>

<p>"Note that Mr. Gartrey, for the first time in his life, did
not warn the household of his coming by ringing the bell. It
seemed as if his murderer must have been lying in wait for him
just within his own door. But, if so, how had he got into the
apartment? By the logic of circumstances I was forced to the
conclusion that the murderer was not lying in wait for his
victim; <i>they entered the apartment together</i>. If I was
right about this, the murderer was certainly a man who was in Mr.
Gartrey's confidence and this could be no other than Coler. But
still no evidence. The boys downstairs all testified that Mr.
Gartrey had come in alone.</p>

<p>"Well, if Coler had not come in with Mr. Gartrey, he must have
been waiting for him somewhere inside the house. There was only
one possible hiding place, the stairs. This stairway is contained
within a fireproof shaft alongside the elevator. In a house of
this type, the stairs are never used, and a man lurking there
would be safe from discovery. On every floor at right angles to
the elevator there is a fireproof door leading to the stairway.
Since the stairway is supposed to serve as a fire escape, these
doors are never locked. Each door has a little square pane of
glass let in at eye level. It was therefore simple for Coler to
wait behind the door watching for the coming of Mr. Gartrey.
Coler would tell him that he had been watching on his behalf, or
to prevent him from doing something reckless&mdash;or what you
like. Mr. Gartrey trusted him. And after Coler had shot Gartrey,
how easy to slip back into his hiding place on the stairs and
watch there until the little elevator hall filled with excited
people drawn by the report of the murder, all trying to get into
the Gartrey apartment. Coler could mix with these people and none
would be able to say later where he had come from.</p>

<p>"Still, I had no evidence that I could take into court. I had
made the interesting discovery that though Mr. Gartrey was dead,
Denman, the spy, was still reporting everything that happened in
the house to somebody outside, by telephone. He did me the honor
to take notice of all my comings. So, it appeared, he had been
serving two masters. Had he telephoned to two men on the
afternoon of the murder? Coler had a private phone on his desk.
It was not until the day before yesterday that I discovered
Denman was calling George Coler by his private number. The rest
was easy. I found that shortly after three o'clock on November
3rd, Denman had seduced the two boys who were on duty at the
service entrance away from their post, thus enabling Coler to
gain the service stairway unseen. Coler had climbed the stairs to
the roof and, crossing the roof, had descended the front stairs.
Mrs. Bradford saw him on the roof and my case was complete,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"A very clever piece of deduction, Mr. Mappin," said the young
District Attorney patronizingly. Lee rubbed his upper lip.</p>

<p>Inspector Loasby, who knew Lee much better, said nothing, but
only grasped Lee's hand and shook it solemnly.</p>

<p>"How did Coler get possession of Al Yohe's gun?" asked the
District Attorney.</p>

<p>"For some weeks previous to the event, Coler had been
assiduously cultivating Al Yohe's friendship. He was a frequent
visitor to the young man's flat. The careless Al was often shut
up in his dark room when people came, and Coler had ample
opportunity to look for the gun."</p>

<p>"What about the Philadelphia murder?"</p>

<p>"A clumsy crime. The astute Coler had no part in that. It was
a private venture of Mrs. Gartrey's, undertaken to save, as she
thought, the man she loved. Coler was terribly upset when he
learned of it. He was clever enough to see that it was likely to
lead to disaster for both of them. It was undoubtedly Coler's
idea to hang that murder on Al and to bring Harry Brummel into
the case. Brummel will be able to wriggle out of it on the
pretense of ignorance, but I'll get him some day!"</p>

<p>"What about the man who tried to shoot Al Yohe at Mount
Pisgah?"</p>

<p>"Nobody got a good look at that man, but it was undoubtedly
George Coler. I suppose he had followed me up there on Sunday and
so discovered Al's hiding place. By that time he realized that
the whole structure was coming down on his and Agnes' heads, and
that Al's death was the only thing that would save them."</p>

<p>"And then the double suicide."</p>

<p>"I doubt if that was a double suicide," said Lee gravely. "The
woman had not nerve enough to face death. Coler got her to enter
his car on the pretext perhaps of escaping, and he drove over the
cliff."</p>

<p>"Jocker Stacey's charge that Al Yohe hired him to kill Robert
Hawkins is still in evidence," said the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"We needn't worry about that," said Lee. "Coler and Mrs.
Gartrey are dead, and the enormous price offered Jocker for the
lie will never be paid. There is no reason now why Jocker should
not tell the truth."</p>

<p>"But without Harry Brummel to save him, Jocker must know that
he will have to burn; a cold-blooded murder undertaken for pay.
Suppose out of sheer cussedness he refuses to change his
story?"</p>

<p>"Al Yohe is provided with an alibi," said Lee. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>POSTSCRIPT</h2>

<p class="first">ALASTAIR YOHE was not required to stand trial on
either charge. Jocker Stacey recanted his first confession to the
police and threw himself on the mercy of the court. He was,
nevertheless, condemned to die. In his final confession, he named
Alan Barry Deane as the man who had sought him out and had
introduced him to Mrs. Gartrey. Deane had not been present during
Jocker's interviews with the lady and was not liable to
prosecution, since it could not be proved that he knew a murder
was involved. However, it dealt a fatal blow to the elegant Mr.
Deane's reputation and he disappeared from New York.</p>

<p>Al Yohe sold out of La Sourabaya and that scintillating
establishment went the way of most of its kind and was presently
extinguished. After a period of retirement from the public view,
the Yohes turned up in Washington, where Al purchased a little
hotel on Seventeenth Street in the thick of things and christened
it the Charlotte. It gradually became known to the international
gourmets that this was not just another hotel, but a place where
superlative food was to be had&mdash;at a price. People then
asked themselves why such a restaurant had not been opened in the
nation's capital long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Amos Lee Mappin had no inconsiderable part in making the
Charlotte a success. He got into the habit of flying down to
Washington about once a fortnight during the season to give a
dinner. In New York Mr. Mappin's little dinners had long been
famous, but they brought a new note into the oppressively formal
atmosphere of social Washington. Actually, the guests were not
chosen for their names but for their personalities; Senators,
Cabinet ministers, and Ambassadors had to take their chance with
the unknown man. In attending one of Mr. Mappin's dinners you
ground no social ax, you assumed no obligations; you went solely
to enjoy yourself. It was quite an innovation.</p>

<p>Lee's chief sources of pleasure in his dinners at the Hotel
Charlotte were that he was served by his friend, old Franois,
and that the delicious Charlotte herself was placed opposite him
at the table where he could look at her. Charlotte was an
exception among the ladies present; she was not clever at all;
but according to Lee the aura of sweetness surrounding her
provided a sauce for his food rarer than any the chef could
evolve. </p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">A LETTER</a></h2>

<h3>HOW AMOS LEE MAPPIN WAS SNARED INTO AN<br> INTERVIEW BY AN
ENGAGING YOUNG REPORTER</h3><br>

<p class="typewriter">Darling Mary:</p>

<p class="typewriter">I have the most wonderful news for you! I
have a job as reporter on the "Blade." On my first day at work I
secured an interview with Amos Lee Mappin (through dumb luck) and
my salary was doubled! Excuse it if you find me a little
breathless. I enclose a clipping of the interview as it appeared
this morning. Of course the rewrite man has bitched it some, but
not too much. This is the official interview. Now I'm going to
tell you what really happened.</p>

<p class="typewriter">To begin at the beginning; after my first
interview with the city editor of the "Blade," I returned
yesterday at noon to hear the verdict and was hired on probation
at twenty-five a week, starvation wages in New York. For my first
assignment I was told to interview Amos Lee Mappin and get a line
on his personal habits, methods of work, etc. It seems this is a
kind of joke they play on each greenhorn that comes into the
office. It's supposed to take down his conceit. But I didn't know
that of course, and I set out to do or die.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Mr. Mappin has an office in an old building
on lower Madison Avenue and I went there in the middle of the
afternoon. He has two lovely secretaries, one blonde, one
brunette. The little blonde one did the talking. She was
perfectly businesslike of course, but there was a provoking
twinkle in her eye too. The other girl addressed her as
Fanny.</p>

<p class="typewriter">She said Mr. Mappin was out, but I knew by
instinct that she was lying. There was an inner office with the
door closed. She asked me what I wanted of him and I gave her my
song and dance. Mr. Mappin never gave any interviews she said,
except when he was engaged on a case that the public was entitled
to know about. Since the Gartrey case has been settled there was
nothing more to give out. Mr. Mappin was engaged in writing a
book and could not be interrupted. This was positive and final. I
spun it out as long as I could, hoping the inner door might open,
but these girls were old hands at dealing with crashers and when
the little one said as sweet as peaches: "You'll have to excuse
us now," I had to beat it.</p>

<p class="typewriter">For a good two hours I walked up and down
on the other side of the street watching the door. I knew what
Mr. Mappin looked like from newspaper pictures, but he never came
out. Shortly after five the two girls appeared and went home. I
was pretty sure he was still there so I crossed the street and
went up to his office. The door was locked now. There was a light
in the back room so I just lighted my pipe and waited in the
hall. In about half an hour he came out. Gosh! I had to work
fast!</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Mr. Mappin," I said, "I'm a reporter on
the 'Blade.'"</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Charmed!" he said sarcastically, "but
you'll have to excuse me."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"I was hired today on probation," I said,
"and instructed to interview you. If I don't get anything I'll be
fired to-morrow."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"That will be just too bad," he said,
starting down the stairs. But he had a sort of smiling look and I
had a hunch to tell him about you and how we were going to be
married as soon as I made good. All this while we were trotting
downstairs side by side.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Well!" he said when we got out in the
street, "this is a desperate case!" He looked me over and
said:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"You appear to be a good young egg though
I'm probably mistaken. I don't know whether I'll give you an
interview or not, but you may ride uptown with me."</p>

<p class="typewriter">So we got in a taxi. He told the man to
drive up Fifth Avenue. I started asking him what I thought were
intelligent questions, but he paid no attention. Instead he
produced a snuffbox and springing the lid, offered me a pinch.
That shut me up. Seems it's a trick of his to offer snuff to
strangers just to see them look surprised. Nobody ever takes any.
Then he started to talk without any prompting from me.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"It may take half an hour to get to Fifty-sixth
Street this way but I wouldn't miss it. I have a passion
for this city and this street. I recommend such an impersonal
passion, young man, but of course at your age you can't see
anything in it. One expects no return consequently there's no
heart-break involved neither any possibility of satiety. It will
last out one's life. Observe Altman's window-dressing. There is a
creative spirit behind it. The most vital art of our day is to be
found in window-dressing, but nobody takes it seriously because
it's only to sell goods."</p>

<p class="typewriter">And so on all the way up the Avenue; a
little lecture on the old library and the gigantic office
building towering above it; the landmarks that have disappeared;
Maillard's, Sherry's, Delmonico's and those that have survived;
the St. Regis and the Gotham. He got off a little prose poem
about the R.C.A. tower; "a gigantic sarcophagus raised to the
sky." St. Patrick's cathedral he said, was built five hundred
years too late. Not a word about my interview until we drew up
before the door of his apartment house on the East River. There,
while sitting in the cab, he said with his eyes twinkling behind
his glasses&mdash;you can't be sure whether he's pulling your leg
or not:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"I have to protect myself because I am by
nature indiscreet. I love to talk off the reservation and I have
learned that it does not pay; there are too many ill-natured
people in the world. But you look like a generous fellow, not yet
corrupted by the town; if I give you your interview will you show
me what you write before turning it in and promise not to add
anything afterwards."</p>

<p class="typewriter">Of course I agreed to that.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"If you're so keen about the city," I said,
"why must it corrupt me?"</p>

<p class="typewriter">"I'm crazy about it," he said, "but I am
not kidded by it; it's a bad place for the young because of the
furious, bitter struggle to get on in the world. The only thing
that saved me was that I inherited a modest fortune."</p>

<p class="typewriter">I said: "I have no fortune, but if you
would be my friend perhaps that will save me."</p>

<p class="typewriter">He was tickled. He clapped me on the
shoulder saying:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"By God! I never received a prettier
compliment! And from one of my own sex, too! Come on in and have
a drink!"</p>

<p class="typewriter">I have described his apartment in my
newspaper interview so I need not enlarge on it here. He has a
cadaverous man-servant called Jermyn who idolizes him. When Mr.
Mappin likes anybody he is always poking fun at him, that's how
you know when you're making good with him. We sat in front of the
fire with the best Scotch and soda I ever tasted and he said:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Well, start the interview." Whereupon
every idea flew out of my head. My first question was banal
enough.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Why have you never married, Mr. Mappin?"
His eyes twinkled but he never cracked a smile.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"This is off the record, my boy. My inches
are too few and my pounds too many. I recognized in the beginning
that I would never make a figure of romance and I put it behind
me. Men of my figure are usually attracted to Amazons of six feet
or over and they do not respond to our devotion. I have my
compensations, though. Men who are forever chasing after some
woman or other can have no idea what interesting creatures they
are when examined dispassionately."</p>

<p class="typewriter">My next approach was not much more sensible
and he was frank to tell me so. I asked him to describe his
methods of work and he said:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"How can I do that when each case presents
a new set of problems? However, I will lend you a couple of my
books and if you read the cases in which I have myself
participated, you can see exactly how I proceeded. There is no
magic in it. I will give you one piece of information that must
be carefully guarded from the public."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"What's that?" I asked eagerly. He said
with his grave face and shining glasses:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"I follow my hunches!" I suppose I showed
in my face that I felt sold, because he laughed in his silent
way, and poured me another drink.</p>

<p class="typewriter">When I asked him about his museum of crime
that everybody talks about, he said:</p>

<p class="typewriter">"There's nothing to it. I have of course a
file of notes, clippings, photographs and all printed or written
matter pertaining to crime. Every one who does research must keep
such a file. But material objects have no interest for me after I
have finished with them. I am, to misquote Hokusai, the old man
mad about psychology. What I am always after is, what makes
people behave the way they do? However, I have a few objects that
have been saved for one reason or another and I'll show you
those."</p>

<p class="typewriter">He opened a cabinet in his living room.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"This odd little wooden barrel contains
what is left of the cyanide that killed His Highness the Sultan
of Shihkar when he was on his way to pay his respects to the
President in Washington. You had better not unscrew the top. It
was tossed out of a window of the Sultan's private car and picked
up beside the Pennsylvania tracks next day. That was one of the
strangest cases I ever confronted. It proved to me that after all
the Eastern mind works in much the same fashion as the Western. I
have kept the odd little barrel because I have never been able to
establish how it came into the hands of the murderer. Every case
leaves one or two such loose threads to tantalize the
investigator.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"This," he went on, picking up a dainty
little arrangement of human hair, "is the false mustache worn by
the murderer of Gavin Dordress, the celebrated playwright, who
was shot in his penthouse apartment a few years ago. The
murderer, you may remember, reversing the usual process, shaved
off his mustache to commit the crime and wore a false one
afterwards to avoid detection. There is no reason for saving
this. My man Jermyn happened to pick it up here in my living-room
and stuck it in the cabinet."</p>

<p class="typewriter">The next object Mr. Mappin selected was a
smooth gold knob.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"This once formed the head of a heavy ebony
walking-stick. With this stick the famous Rene Doria was killed
in his love nest in the Lancaster apartments&mdash;not killed
exactly; he was struck down with the stick and shot through the
head. A young man of extraordinary good looks, he masqueraded as
an Italian count and cut a wide swath in the nightclubs. He was
about to marry one of our greatest heiresses when he was killed.
In reality he was the son of a barber in Kansas City or some such
place. I saved the knob because I have reason to suspect that it
was the instrument of several other murders, and I am hoping that
some day I may be able to fit the jig-saw puzzle together."</p>

<p class="typewriter">I asked Mr. Mappin if he had preserved any
relics of the Walter Ashley murder which created so much
excitement at the time.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Only the sheaf of letters," he said, "that
the murderer wrote to me before and after the crime, challenging
me to bring it to light. They have a quite unusual psychological
value. That murder would never have been discovered had it not
been for the scoundrel's vanity. He had to tell somebody how
clever he was."</p>

<p class="typewriter">"Didn't he send you his victim's ear?" I
asked.</p>

<p class="typewriter">"He did," said Mr. Mappin, "but I have not
preserved that little relic."</p>

<p class="typewriter">Mr. Mappin fetched the letters from his
file and allowed me to read them. I had read them before in the
newspapers, but it gave me a thrill actually to have the
originals in my hands.</p>

<p class="typewriter">You can piece out the rest of our talk from
the newspaper interview. I rushed away to my room and wrote the
interview. Mr. Mappin revised it and passed it the same night and
I was able to turn it in before the paper went to press. Did I
enjoy my entrance at the office&mdash;and how! The boss at first
refused to believe that the stuff was authentic. He called up
Mappin to verify it. Then he gave me the raise. I believe we
could get along on fifty a week though it would be close going in
New York. But the point is that through the kindness of this old
gent I have established myself at the office and things seem to
be breaking right.</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">How about setting a date?</p>

<p class="typewriter">Yours ever,</p>

<p class="typewriter">Frank</p>
