<p>The bishop was feeling rather sea-sick. Confoundedly sea-sick,
in fact.</p>

<p>This annoyed him. For he disapproved of sickness in every shape
or form. His own state of body was far from satisfactory at that
moment; Africa&mdash;he was Bishop of Bampopo in the Equatorial
Regions&mdash;had played the devil with his lower gastric
department and made him almost an invalid; a circumstance of which
he was nowise proud, seeing that ill-health led to inefficiency in
all walks of life. There was nothing he despised more than
inefficiency. Well or ill, he always insisted on getting through
his tasks in a businesslike fashion. That was the way to live, he
used to say. Get through with it. Be perfect of your kind, whatever
that kind may be. Hence his sneaking fondness for the
natives&mdash;they were such fine, healthy animals.</p>

<p>Fine, healthy animals; perfect of their kind! Africa liked them
to "get through with it" according to their own lights. But there
was evidently a little touch of spitefulness and malice about
Africa; something almost human. For when white people try to get
through with it after their particular fashion, she makes hay of
their livers or something. That is what had happened to Thomas
Heard, D.D., Bishop of Bampopo. He had been so perfect of his kind,
such an exemplary pastor, that there was small chance of a return
to the scenes of his episcopal labours. Anybody could have told him
what would happen. He ought to have allowed for a little human
weakness, on the part of the Black Continent. It could not be
helped. For the rest, he was half inclined to give up the Church
and take to some educational work on his return to England. Perhaps
that was why he at present preferred to be known as "Mr. Heard." It
put people at their ease, and him too.</p>

<p>Whence now this novel and unpleasant sensation in the upper
gastric region? Most annoying! He had dined discreetly at his hotel
the evening before; had breakfasted with moderation. And had he not
voyaged in many parts of the world, in China Seas and round the
Cape? Was he not even then on his return journey from Zanzibar? No
doubt. But the big liner which deposited him yesterday at the
thronged port was a different concern from this wretched tub,
reeking with indescribable odours as it rolled in the oily swell of
the past storm through which the <i>Mozambique</i> had ridden
without a tremor. The benches, too, were frightfully uncomfortable,
and sticky with sirocco moisture under the breathless awning. Above
all, there was the unavoidable spectacle of the suffering
passengers, natives of the country; it infected him with misery. In
attitudes worthy of Michelangelo they sprawled about the deck,
groaning with anguish; huddled up in corners with a
lemon-prophylactic against sea-sickness, apparently-pressed to
faces which, by some subtle process of colour-adaptation, had
acquired the complexion of the fruit; tottering to the
taffrail...</p>

<p>There was a peasant woman dressed in black, holding an infant to
her breast. Both child and parent suffered to a distressing degree.
By some kindly dispensation of Providence they contrived to be ill
in turns, and the situation might have verged on the comical but
for the fact that blank despair was written on the face of the
mother. She evidently thought her last day had come, and still, in
the convulsions of her pain, tried to soothe the child. An ungainly
creature, with a big scar across one cheek. She suffered dumbly,
like some poor animal. The bishop's heart went out to her.</p>

<p>He took out his watch. Two more hours of discomfort to be gone
through! Then he looked over the water. The goal was far
distant.</p>

<p>Viewed from the clammy deck on this bright morning, the island
of Nepenthe resembled a cloud. It was a silvery speck upon that
limitless expanse of blue sea and sky. A south wind breathed over
the Mediterranean waters, drawing up their moisture which lay
couched in thick mists abut its flanks and uplands. The comely
outlines were barely suggested through a veil of fog. An air of
irreality hung about the place. Could this be an island? A
veritable island of rocks and vineyards and houses&mdash;this
pallid apparition? It looked like some snowy sea-bird resting upon
the waves; a sea-bird or a cloud; one of those lonely clouds that
stray from their fellows and drift about in wayward fashion at the
bidding of every breeze.</p>

<p>All the better-class natives had disappeared below save an
unusually fat young priest with a face like a full moon, who
pretended to be immersed in his breviary but was looking out of the
corner of his eye all the time at a pretty peasant girl reclining
uncomfortably in a corner. He rose and arranged the cushions to her
liking. In doing so he must have made some funny remark in her ear,
for she smiled wanly as she said:</p>

<p>"Grazie, Don Francesco."</p>

<p>"Means thank you, I suppose," thought the Bishop. "But why is he
a don?"</p>

<p>Of the other alien travellers, those charming but rather
metallic American ladies had retired to the cabin; so had the
English family; so had everybody, in fact. On deck there remained
of the foreign contingent nobody but himself and Mr. Muhlen, a
flashy over-dressed personage who seemed to relish the state of
affairs. He paced up and down, cool as a cucumber, trying to walk
like a sailor, and blandly indifferent to the agonized
fellow-creatures whom the movements of the vessel caused him to
touch, every now and then, with the point of his patent-leather
boots. Patent-leather boots. That alone classes him, thought Mr.
Heard. Once he paused and remarked, in his horrible pronunciation
of English:</p>

<p>"That woman over there with the child! I wonder what I would do
in her place? Throw it into the water, I fancy. It's often the only
way of getting rid of a nuisance."</p>

<p>"Rather a violent measure," replied the Bishop politely.</p>

<p>"You're not feeling very well, sir?" he continued, with a fine
assumption of affability. "I am so sorry. As for me, I like a
little movement of the boat. You know our proverb? Weeds don't
spoil. I'm alluding to myself, of course!"</p>

<p>Weeds don't spoil...</p>

<p>Yes, he was a weed. Mr. Heard had not taken kindly to him; he
hoped they would not see too much of each other on Nepenthe, which
he understood to be rather a small place. A few words of civility
over the table d'hote had led to an exchange of cards&mdash;a
continental custom which Mr. Heard always resented. It could not
easily be avoided in the present case. They had talked of Nepenthe,
or rather Mr. Muhlen had talked; the bishop, as usual, preferring
to listen and to learn. Like himself, Mr. Muhlen had never before
set foot on the place. To be sure, he had visited other
Mediterranean islands; he knew Sicily fairly well and had once
spent a pleasant fortnight on Capri. But Nepenthe was different.
The proximity to Africa, you know; the volcanic soil. Oh yes! It
was obviously quite another sort of island. Business? No! He was
not bound on any errand of business; not on any errand at all. Just
a little pleasure trip. One owes something to one's self:
<i>n'est-ce-pas</i>? And this early summer was certainly the best
time for travelling. One could count on good weather; one could
sleep in the afternoon, if the heat were excessive. He had
telegraphed for a couple of rooms in what was described as the best
hotel&mdash;he hoped the visitors staying there would be to his
liking. Unfortunately&mdash;so he gathered&mdash;the local society
was a little mixed, a little&mdash;how shall we
say?&mdash;ultra-cosmopolitan. The geographical situation of the
island, lying near the converging point of many trade-routes, might
account for this. And then its beauty and historical associations:
they attracted strange tourists from every part of the world. Queer
types! Types to be avoided, perhaps. But what did it matter, after
all? It was one of the advantages of being a man, a civilized man,
that you could amuse yourself among any class of society. As for
himself, he liked the common people, the peasants and fishermen; he
felt at home among them; they were so genuine, so refreshingly
different.</p>

<p>To suchlike ingratiating and rather obvious remarks the bishop
had listened, over the dinner table, with urbane acquiescence and
growing distrust. Peasants and fisher folks! This fellow did not
look as if he cared for such company. He was probably a fraud.</p>

<p>They had met again in the evening, and taken a short stroll
along the quay where a noisy band was discoursing operatic airs.
The performance elicited from Mr. Muhlen some caustic comments on
Latin music as contrasted with that of Russia and other countries.
He evidently knew the subject. Mr. Heard, to whom music was Greek,
soon found himself out of his depths. Later on, in the
smoking-room, they had indulged in a game of cards&mdash;the bishop
being of that broadminded variety which has not the slightest
objection to a gentlemanly gamble. Once more his companion had
revealed himself as an accomplished amateur.</p>

<p>No; it was something else that annoyed him about the
man&mdash;certain almost contemptuous remarks he had dropped in the
course of the evening on the subject of the female sex; not any
particular member of it, but the sex in general. Mr. Heard was
sensitive on that point. He was not disheartened by experience. He
had never allowed his judgment to be warped by those degrading
aspects of womanhood which he had encountered during his work among
the London poor, and more recently in Africa, where women are
treated as the veriest beasts. He kept his ideals bright. He would
tolerate no flippant allusions to the sex. Muhlen's talk had left a
bad taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>And here he was, prancing up and down, sublimely pleased with
himself. Mr. Heard watched his perambulations with mixed
feelings&mdash;moral disapproval combining with a small grain of
envy at the fellow's conspicuous immunity from the prevailing
sea-sickness.</p>

<p>A weed; unquestionably a weed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mainland slowly receded. Morning wore on, and
under the fierce attraction of the sun the fogs were drawn upwards.
Nepenthe became tangible&mdash;an authentic island. It gleamed with
golden rocks and emerald patches of culture. A cluster of white
houses, some town or village, lay perched on the middle heights
where a playful sunbeam had struck a pathway through the vapours.
The curtain was lifted. Half lifted; for the volcanic peaks and
ravines overhead were still shrouded in pearly mystery.</p>

<p>The fat priest looked up from his breviary and smiled in
friendly fashion.</p>

<p>"I heard you speak English to that person," he began, with
hardly a trace of foreign accent. "You will pardon me. I see you
are unwell. May I get you a lemon? Or perhaps a glass of
cognac?"</p>

<p>"I am feeling better, thank you. It must have been the sight of
those poor people that upset me. They seem to suffer horribly. I
suppose I have got used to it."</p>

<p>"They do suffer. And they get used to it too. I often wonder
whether they are as susceptible to pain and discomfort as the rich
with their finer nervous structure. Who can say? Animals also have
their sufferings, but they are not encouraged to tell us about
them. Perhaps that is why God made them dumb. Zola, in one of his
novels, speaks of a sea-sick donkey."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Heard. It was an old-fashioned trick he had
got from his mother. "Dear me!"</p>

<p>He wondered what this youthful ecclesiastic was doing with Zola.
In fact, he was slightly shocked. But he never allowed such a state
of affairs to be noticed.</p>

<p>"You like Zola?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Not much. He is rather a dirty dog, and his technique is so
ridiculously transparent. But one can't help respecting the man. If
I were to read this class of literature for my own amusement I
would prefer, I think, Catulle Mendes. But I don't. I read it, you
understand, in order to be able to penetrate into the minds of my
penitents, many of whom refuse to deprive themselves of such books.
Women are so influenced by what they read! Personally, I am not
very fond of improper writers. And yet they sometimes make one
laugh in spite of one's self, don't they? I perceive you are
feeling better."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard could not help saying:</p>

<p>"You express yourself very well in English."</p>

<p>"Oh, passably! I have preached to large congregations of
Catholics in the United States. In England, too. My mother was
English. The Vatican has been pleased to reward the poor labours of
my tongue by the title of Monsignor."</p>

<p>"My congratulations. You are rather young for a Monsignor, are
you not? We are apt to associate that distinction with snuff-boxes
and gout and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-nine. It is a good age. One begins to appreciate things
at their true value. Your collar! Might I enquire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, my collar; the last vestige...Yes, I am a bishop. Bishop of
Bampopo in Central Africa."</p>

<p>"You are rather young, surely, for a bishop?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard smiled.</p>

<p>"The youngest on the list, I believe. There were not many
applicants for the place; the distance from England, the hard work,
and the climate, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bishop. Indeed!"</p>

<p>He waxed thoughtful. Probably he imagined that his companion was
telling him some traveller's tale.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Mr. Heard. "I am what we call a 'Returned
Empty.' It is a phrase we apply in England to Colonial bishops who
come back from their dioceses."</p>

<p>"Returned Empty! That sounds like beer."</p>

<p>The priest was looking perplexed, as though uncertain of the
other's state of mind. Southern politeness, or curiosity, overcame
his fears. Perhaps this foreigner was fond of joking. Well, he
would humour him.</p>

<p>"You will see our bishop to-morrow," he pursued blandly. "He
comes over for the feast of the patron saint; you are lucky in
witnessing it. The whole island is decorated. There will be music
and fireworks and a grand procession. Our bishop is a dear old man,
though not exactly what you would call a liberal," he added, with a
laugh. "That is as it should be, is it not? We like our elders to
be conservative. They counteract the often violent modernism of the
youngsters. Is this your first visit to Nepenthe?"</p>

<p>"It is. I have heard much about the beauty of the place."</p>

<p>"You will like it. The people are intelligent. There is good
food and wine. Our lobsters are celebrated. You will find
compatriots on the island, some ladies among them; the Duchess of
San Martino, for instance, who happens to be an American; some
delightful ladies! And the country girls, too, are worthy of a
benevolent glance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That procession is sure to interest me. What is the name of
your patron?"</p>

<p>"Saint Dodekanus. He has a wonderful history. There is an
Englishman on Nepenthe, Mr. Earnest Eames, a student, who will tell
you all about it. He knows more about the saint than I do; one
would think he dined with him every evening. But he is a great
hermit&mdash;Mr. Eames, I mean. And it is so good of our old bishop
to come over," he pursued with a shade of emphasis. "His work keeps
him mostly on the mainland. He has a large see&mdash;nearly thirty
square miles. How large, by the way, is your diocese?"</p>

<p>"I cannot give you the exact figures," Mr. Heard replied. "It
has often taken me three weeks to travel from one end to the other.
It is probably not much smaller than the kingdom of Italy."</p>

<p>"The kingdom of Italy. Indeed!"</p>

<p>That settled it. The conversation died abruptly; the friendly
priest relapsed into silence. He looked hurt and disappointed. This
was more than a joke. He had done his best to be civil to a
suffering foreigner, and this was his reward&mdash;to be fooled
with the grossest of fables. Maybe he remembered other occasions
when Englishmen had developed a queer sense of humour which he
utterly failed to appreciate. A liar. Or possibly a lunatic; one of
those harmless enthusiasts who go about the world imagining
themselves to be the Pope or the Archangel Gabriel. However that
might be, he said not another word, but took to reading his
breviary in good earnest, for the first time.</p>

<p>The boat anchored. Natives poured out in a stream. Mr. Muhlen
drove up alone, presumably to his sumptuous hotel. The bishop,
having gathered his luggage together, followed in another carriage.
He enjoyed the drive along that winding upward track; he admired
the festal decorations of the houses, the gardens and vineyards,
the many-tinted rock scenery overhead, the smiling sunburnt
peasantry. There was an air of contentment and well-being about the
place; something joyful, opulent, almost dramatic.</p>

<p>"I like it," he concluded.</p>

<p>And he wondered how long it would be before he met his cousin,
Mrs. Meadows, on whose account he had undertaken to break the
journey to England.</p>

<p>Don Francesco, the smiling priest, soon outstripped both of
them, in spite of a ten minutes' conversation on the quay with the
pretty peasant girl of the steamer. He had engaged the fastest
driver on the island, and was now tearing frantically up the road,
determined to be the first to apprise the Duchess of the lunatic's
arrival.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c02.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>The Duchess of San Martino, a kind-hearted and imposing lady of
mature age who, under favourable atmospheric conditions (in
winter-time, for instance, when the powder was not so likely to run
down her face), might have passed, so far as profile was concerned,
for a faded French beauty of bygone centuries&mdash;the Duchess was
no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>It was an old rule. Nobody knew when it first came into vogue.
Mr. Eames, bibliographer of Nepenthe, had traced it down to the
second Phoenician period, but saw no reason why the Phoenicians,
more than anybody else, should have established the precedent. On
the contrary, he was inclined to think that it dated from yet
earlier days; days when the Troglodytes, Manigones, Septocardes,
Merdones, Anthropophagoi and other hairy aboriginals used to paddle
across, in crazy canoes, to barter the produce of their savage
African glens-serpent-skins, and gums, and gazelle horns, and
ostrich eggs&mdash;for those super-excellent lobsters and peasant
girls for which Nepenthe had been renowned from time immemorial. He
based this scholarly conjecture on the fact that a gazelle horn,
identified as belonging to a now extinct Tripolitan species, was
actually discovered on the island, while an adolescent female skull
of the hypo-dolichocephalous (Nepenthean) type had come to light in
some excavations at Benghazi.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant rule. It ran to the effect that in the course
of the forenoon all the inhabitants of Nepenthe, of whatever age,
sex, or condition, should endeavour to find themselves in the
market-place or piazza&mdash;a charming square, surrounded on three
sides by the principal buildings of the town and open, on the
fourth, to a lovely prospect over land and sea. They were to meet
on this spot; here to exchange gossip, make appointments for the
evening, and watch the arrival of new-comers to their island. An
admirable rule! For it effectively prevented everybody from doing
any kind of work in the morning; and after luncheon, of course, you
went to sleep. It was delightful to be obliged, by iron convention,
to stroll about in the bright sunshine, greeting your friends,
imbibing iced drinks, and letting your eye stray down to the lower
level of the island with its farmhouses embowered in vineyards; or
across the glittering water towards the distant coastline and its
volcano; or upwards, into those pinnacles of the higher region
against whose craggy ramparts, nearly always, a fleet of snowy
sirocco-clouds was anchored. For Nepenthe was famous not only for
its girls and lobsters, but also for its south wind.</p>

<p>As usual at this hour the market-place was crowded with folks.
It was a gay throng. Priests and curly-haired children, farmers,
fishermen, citizens, a municipal policeman or two, brightly dressed
women of all ages, foreigners in abundance&mdash;they moved up and
down, talking, laughing, gesticulating. Nobody had anything
particular to do; such was the rule.</p>

<p>The Russian sect was well represented. They were religious
enthusiasts, ever increasing in numbers and led by their Master,
the divinely inspired Bazhakuloff, who was then living in almost
complete seclusion on the island. They called themselves the
"Little White Cows," to mark their innocence of worldly affairs,
and their scarlet blouses, fair hair, and wondering blue eyes were
quite a feature of the place. Overhead, fluttering flags and
wreaths of flowers, and bunting, and brightly tinted paper
festoons&mdash;an orgy of colour, in honour of the saint's festival
on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Duchess, attired in black, with a black and white sunshade,
and a string of preposterous amethysts nestling in the imitation
Val of her bosom, was leaning on the arm of an absurdly
good-looking youth whom she addressed as Denis. Everyone called him
Denis or Mr. Denis. People used his surname as little as possible.
It was Phipps.</p>

<p>With a smile for everyone, she moved more deliberately than the
rest, and used her fan rather more frequently. She knew that the
sirocco was making stealthy inroads upon her carefully powdered
cheeks; she wanted to look her best on the arrival of Don
Francesco, who was to bring some important message from the
clerical authorities of the mainland anent her forthcoming
reception into the Roman Catholic Church. He was her friend. Soon
he would be her confessor.</p>

<p>Wordly-wise, indolent, good-natured and, like most Southerners,
a thorough-going pagan, Don Francesco was deservedly popular as
ecclesiastic. Women adored him; he adored women. He passed for an
unrivalled preacher; his golden eloquence made converts everywhere,
greatly to the annoyance of the <i>parroco</i>, the parish priest,
who was doubtless sounder on the Trinity but a shocking bad orator
and altogether deficient in humanity, and who nearly had a fit,
they said, when the other was created Monsignor. Don Francesco was
a fisher of men, and of women. He fished <i>ad maiorem Dei
gloriam</i>, and for the fun of the thing. It was his way of taking
exercise, he once confessed to his friend Keith; he was too fat to
run about like other people&mdash;he could only talk. He fished
among natives, and among foreigners.</p>

<p>Foreigners were hard to catch, on Nepenthe. They came and went
in such breathless succession. Of the permanent residents only the
Duchess, always of High Church leanings, had of late yielded to his
blandishments. She was fairly hooked. Madame Steynlin, a lady of
Dutch extraction whose hats were proverbial, was uncompromisingly
Lutheran. The men were past redemption, all save the Commissioner
who, however, was under bad influences and an incurable wobbler,
anyhow. Eames, the scholar, cared for nothing but his books. Keith,
a rich eccentric who owned one of the finest villas and gardens on
the place, only came to the island for a few weeks every year. He
knew too much, and had travelled too far, to be anything but a
hopeless unbeliever; besides, he was a particular friend of his,
with whom he agreed, in his heart of hearts, on every subject. The
frequenters of the Club were mostly drunkards, derelicts, crooks,
or faddist&mdash;not worth catching.</p>

<p>Carriages began to arrive on the scene. That of Don Francesco
drove up first of all. He stepped out and sailed across the piazza
like a schooner before the wind. But his discourse, usually ample
and florid as befitted both his person and his calling, was couched
on this occasion in Tacitean brevity.</p>

<p>"We have landed a queer fish, Duchess," he remarked. "He calls
himself Bishop of Bim-Bam-Bum, and resembles a broken-down
matrimonial agent. So lean! So yellow! His face all furrowed! He
has lived very viciously, that man. Perhaps he is mad. In every
case, look to your purse, Mr. Denis. He'll be here in a
minute."</p>

<p>"That's quite right," said the young man. "The Bishop of
Bampopo. It's in the <i>New York Herald</i>. Sailing by the
<i>Mozambique</i>. But they didn't say he was coming to the island.
I wonder what he wants here?"</p>

<p>Don Francesco was aghast.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" he asked. "A bishop, and so yellow! He must have
thought me very rude," he added.</p>

<p>"You couldn't be rude if you tried," said the Duchess, giving
him a playful slap with her fan.</p>

<p>She was burning with ardour to be the first to introduce such a
lion to the local society. But fearful of making a <i>faux pas</i>,
she said:</p>

<p>"You'll go and speak to him, Denis. Find out if it's the right
one&mdash;the one you read about in the paper, I mean. Then come
and tell me."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Duchess, don't ask me to do that! I couldn't tackle
a bishop. Not an African. Not unless he has a proper apron on."</p>

<p>"Be a man, Denis. He won't bite a pretty boy like you."</p>

<p>"What nice things the lady is saying to you," observed Don
Francesco.</p>

<p>"She always does," he laughed, "when she wants me to do
something for her. I haven't been on this island long, but I have
already found out the Duchess! You do it, Don Francesco. He is sure
to be the right one. They get yellow, out there. Sometimes
green."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was intercepted on his way to the hotel by the genial
priest, and formally presented to the Duchess. She was more than
condescending to this stern and rather tired-looking man; she was
gracious. She made all kinds of polite enquiries, and indicated the
various sites and persons of interest; while Don Francesco, he
observed, had unaccountably recovered from his sudden attack of bad
humour on the steamer.</p>

<p>"And that is where I live," she said, pointing to a large and
severe structure whose walls had plainly not been whitewashed for
many long years. "It's an old disused convent, built by the Good
Duke Alfred. Wasn't it, Denis?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say, Duchess. I never heard of the
gentleman."</p>

<p>"That Good Duke was an unmitigated ruffian," observed Don
Francesco.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that! Think of all the good he did for the
island. Think of that frieze in the church! I have acres and acres
of rooms to walk about in," she continued, addressing the bishop.
"All by myself! I'm quite a hermit, you know. You will perhaps be
able to have a cup of tea with me to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly a hermit," Denis interposed.</p>

<p>"To take tea with the Duchess is an experience, a revelation,"
said Don Francesco in judicial tones. "I have enjoyed that meal in
various parts of the world, but nobody can manage it like she can.
She has the true gift. You will make tea for us in Paradise, dear
lady. As to luncheon, let me tell you in confidence, Mr. Heard,
that my friend Keith, whom you will meet sooner or later, has a
most remarkable chef. What that man of Keith's cannot cook is not
worth eating."</p>

<p>"How delightful!" replied the bishop, slightly embarrassed. "And
where," he added, laughing&mdash;"where does one dine?"</p>

<p>"I do not dine. Madame Steynlin used to give nice evening
parties," he continued reflectively, and with a shade of sadness in
his voice. "Excellent little dinners! But she is so taken up with
Russians just now; they quite monopolise her house. Down there; do
you see, Mr. Heard? That white villa by the sea, at the end of the
promontory? She is so romantic. That is why she bought a house
which nobody else would have bought at any price. That little
place, all by itself&mdash;it fascinated her. Bitterly she regrets
her choice. She has discovered the drawbacks of a promontory. My
dear Duchess, never live on a promontory! It has fearful
inconveniences; you are overlooked by everybody. All the islands
know what you do, and who visits you, and when, and why...Yes, I
remember those dinners with regret. Nowadays I must content myself
with a miserable supper at home. The doctor has forbidden dinners.
He says I am getting too fat."</p>

<p>Denis remarked:</p>

<p>"Your fat is your fortune, Don Francesco."</p>

<p>"My fortune, then, is a heavy load to bear. Mr. Keith tells me I
have seven double chins, three behind and four in front. He says he
has counted them carefully. He declares that an eighth is in course
of formation. It is too much for a person of my austere
temperament."</p>

<p>"You need never believe a word Keith says," said the Duchess.
"He upsets me with his long words and his&mdash;his awful views. He
really does."</p>

<p>"I tell him he is the Antichrist," observed Don Francesco,
gravely shaking his head. "But we shall see! We shall catch him
yet."</p>

<p>The Duchess had no idea what the Antichrist was, but she felt
sure it was something not quite nice.</p>

<p>"If I thought he was anything like that, I would never ask him
to my house again. The Antichrist! Ah, talk of angels&mdash;"</p>

<p>The person in question suddenly appeared, superintending half a
dozen young gardeners who carried various consignments of plants
wrapped up in straw which had arrived, presumably, by the
steamer.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was older than he looked&mdash;incredibly old, in
fact, though nobody could bring himself to believe it; he was well
preserved by means of a complicated system of life, the details of
which, he used to declare, were not fit for publication. That was
only his way of talking. He exaggerated so dreadfully. His face was
clean-shaven, rosy, and of cherubic fulness; his eyes beamed
owlishly through spectacles which nobody had ever seen him take
off. But for those spectacles he might have passed for a
well-groomed baby in a soap-advertisement. He was supposed to sleep
in them.</p>

<p>It looked as if Mr. Keith had taken an instantaneous liking to
the bishop.</p>

<p>"Bampopo? Why, of course. I've been there. Years and years ago.
Long before your time, I'm afraid. How is the place getting on?
Better roads, no doubt. And better food, I hope? I was much
interested in that little lake&mdash;you know? It seemed to have no
outlet. We must talk it over. And I like those Bulanga
people&mdash;fine fellows! You liked them too? I'm glad to hear it.
Such a lot of nonsense was talked about their depravity! If you
have nothing better to do, come and lunch to-morrow, can you? Villa
Khismet. Anybody will show you the way. You, Denis," he added, "you
disappoint me. You look like a boy who is fond of flowers. And yet
you have never been to see my cannas, which are the finest in the
kingdom, to say nothing of myself, who am also something of a
flower. A carnivorous orchid, I fancy."</p>

<p>"A virgin lily," suggested Don Francesco.</p>

<p>"I wish I could manage to come," replied Mr. Heard. "But I must
look for a cousin of mine to-morrow; Mrs. Meadows. Perhaps you know
her?"</p>

<p>The priest said:</p>

<p>"We all know Mrs. Meadows. And we all like her. Unfortunately
she lives far, far away; right up there," and he pointed vaguely
towards the sirocco clouds. "In the Old Town, I mean. She dwells
like a hermit, all alone. You can drive up there in a carriage, of
course. It is a pity all these nice people live so far away. There
is Count Caloveglia, for instance, whom I would like to see every
day of my life. He talks better English than I do, the old humbug!
He, too, is a hermit. But he will be down here to-morrow. He never
misses the theatricals."</p>

<p>Everybody seems to be a hermit hereabouts, thought Mr. Heard.
And yet this place is seething with people!</p>

<p>Aloud he said:</p>

<p>"So my cousin lives up in the fog. And does it always hang about
like this?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear no!" replied the Duchess. "It goes away sometimes, in
the afternoon. The sirocco, this year, has been most exceptional.
Most exceptional! Don't you think so, Denis?"</p>

<p>"Really couldn't say, Duchess. You know I only arrived last
week."</p>

<p>"Most exceptional! Don Francesco will bear me out."</p>

<p>"It blows," said the priest, "when the good God wishes it to
blow. He has been wishing pretty frequently of late."</p>

<p>"I am writing to your cousin," the Duchess remarked, "to ask her
to my small annual gathering after the festival of Saint Dodekanus.
To-morrow, you know. Quite an informal little affair. I may count
on you, Bishop? You'll all come, won't you? You too, Mr. Keith. But
no long words, remember! Nothing about reflexes and preternatural
and things like that. And not a syllable about the Incarnation,
please. It scares me. What's the name of her villa, Denis?"</p>

<p>"Mon Repos. Rather a commonplace name, I think&mdash;Mon
Repos."</p>

<p>"It is," said Keith. "But there is nothing commonplace about the
lady. She is what I would call a New Woman."</p>

<p>"Dear me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was alarmed at this picture of his cousin. He did not
altogether approve of New Women.</p>

<p>"She has long ago passed the stage you have in mind, Bishop. She
is newer than that. The real novelty! Looks after the baby, and
thinks of her husband in India. I believe I have many points in
common with the New Woman. I often think of people in India."</p>

<p>"Such a dear little child," said the Duchess.</p>

<p>"Almost as round as myself," added Don Francesco. "There goes
the Commissioner! He is fussing about with the judge, that
red-haired man&mdash;do you see, Mr. Heard?&mdash;who limps like
Mephistopheles and spits continually. They say he wants to imprison
all the Russians. Poor folks! They ought to be sent home; they
don't belong here. He is looking at us now. Ha, the animal! He has
the Evil Eye. He is also scrofulous, rachitic. And his name is
Malipizzo."</p>

<p>"What a funny name," remarked the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he is a funny animal. They are great friends, those
two."</p>

<p>"A horrible man, that judge," said the Duchess. "Only think, Mr.
Heard, an atheist."</p>

<p>"A freemason," corrected Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing. And ugly! Nobody has a right to be quite
so ugly. I declare he's worse than the cinematographic
villain&mdash;you remember, Denis?"</p>

<p>"It is a miracle he has lived so long, with that face," added
Don Francesco. "I think God created him in order that mankind
should have some idea of the meaning of the word 'grotesque.'"</p>

<p class="caption">The Commissioner and the Judge</p>

<p>The proud title "Commissioner" caused the bishop to pay
particular attention to the other of the two individuals in
question. He beheld a stumpy and pompous-looking personage, flushed
in the face, with a moth-eaten grey beard and shifty grey eyes,
clothed in a flannel shirt, tweed knickerbockers, brown stockings,
white spats and shoes. Such was the Commissioner's invariable
get-up, save that in winter he wore a cap instead of a panama. He
was smoking a briar pipe and looking blatantly British, as if he
had just spent an unwashed night in a third-class carriage between
King's Cross and Aberdeen. The magistrate, on the other
hand&mdash;the red-haired man&mdash;was jauntily dressed, with a
straw hat on one side of his repulsive head, and plenty of starch
about him.</p>

<p>"I never knew we had a Commissioner here," said Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>Keith replied:</p>

<p>"We haven't. He is Financial Commissioner for Nicaragua. An
incomparable ass is Mr. Freddy Parker."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has a sensible idea now and then, when he forgets to be
a fool," observed Don Francesco. "He is President of the Club, Mr.
Heard. They will elect you honorary member. Take my advice. Avoid
the whisky."</p>

<p>Denis remarked, after a critical glance in the same
direction:</p>

<p>"I notice that the Commissioner looks redder in the face than
when I last saw him."</p>

<p>"That," said Keith, "is one of Mr. Parker's
characteristics."</p>

</p>

<p>Concerning the life and martyrdom of Saint Dodekanus, patron of
Nepenthe, we possess hardly any information of a trustworthy
nature. It is with his career as with that of other saints: they
become overlaid&mdash;encrusted, as it were&mdash;with extraneous
legendary material in the course of ages, even as a
downward-rolling avalanche gathers snow. The nucleus is hard to
find. What is incontestably true may be summed up almost in one
paragraph.</p>

<p>He was born in A.D. 450, or thereabouts, in the city of
Kallisto, in Crete. He was an only child, a beautiful but unruly
boy, the despair of his widowed mother. At the age of thirteen he
encountered, one evening, an elderly man of thoughtful mien, who
addressed him in familiar language. On several later occasions he
discoursed with the same personage, in a grove of laurels and pines
known as Alephane; but what passed between them, and whether it was
some divine apparition, or merely a man of flesh and blood, was
never discovered, for he seems to have kept his mother in ignorance
of the whole affair. From that time onward his conduct changed. He
grew pensive, mild, and charitable. He entered, as youthful
acolyte, a neighbouring Convent of Salacian monks, and quickly
distinguished himself for piety and the gift of miracles. In the
short space of three years, or thereabouts, he had healed eight
lepers, caused the clouds to rain, walked dryshod over several
rivers, and raised twenty-three persons from the dead.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he had a second vision. This time it was
a young woman, of pleasing exterior. He discoursed with her, on
several occasions, in the grove of laurels and pines known as
Alephane; but what passed between them, and whether it was a woman
of flesh and blood, or merely an angel, was never discovered, for
he seems to have kept his brother monks in ignorance of the whole
affair. From that time onward his conduct changed. He grew restless
and desirous of converting the heathen. He set sail for Lybia,
suffered shipwreck in the Greater Syrtis, and narrowly escaped with
his life. Thence he passed onward, preaching to black nations as he
moved along, and converting tribes innumerable. For
three-and-thirty years he wandered till, one evening, he saw the
moon rise on the right side of his face.</p>

<p>He had entered the land of the Crotalophoboi, cannibals and
necromancers who dwelt in a region so hot, and with light so
dazzling, that their eyes grew on the soles of their feet. Here he
laboured for eighty years, redeeming them to Christianity from
their magical and bloodthirsty practices. In recompense whereof
they captured him at the patriarchal age of 132, or thereabouts,
and bound him with ropes between two flat boards of palmwood. Thus
they kept the prisoner, feeding him abundantly, until that old
equinoctial feast drew near. On the evening of that day they sawed
the whole, superstitiously, into twelve separate pieces, one for
each month of the year; and devoured of the saint what was to their
liking.</p>

<p>During this horrid banquet a femur or thigh-bone was
accidentally cast upon a millstone which lay by the shore, having
been borrowed by the Crotalophoboi from the neighbouring tribe of
Garimanes a good many years previously and never returned to them
by reason, they declared, of its excessive weight. There it
remained till, one day, during a potent sirocco tempest, the stone
was uplifted by the force of the waters, and miraculously wafted
over the sea to Nepenthe. Forthwith a chapel was built on the spot,
to commemorate the event and preserve the sacred relic which soon
began working wonders for the good of the island, such as warding
off Saracenic invasions, procuring plentiful vintages, and causing
sterile cattle to produce offspring.</p>

<p>In later years the main church was dedicated to Saint Dodekanus
and the relic moved thither and enclosed within that silver statue
of the saint which is carried abroad in procession at his annual
festival, or on any particular occasion when his help is to be
invoked. And all through succeeding ages the cult of the saint
waxed in pomp and splendour. Nobody, probably, has done more to
foster pious feelings towards their island-patron than the Good
Duke Alfred who, among other things, caused a stately frieze to be
placed in the church, picturing in twelve marble tablets the twelve
chief episodes in the life of the Saint&mdash;one for each month of
the year. This frieze indeed was admired so unreservedly, so
recklessly, that the Good Duke felt it his duty to remove the
sculptor's eyes and (on second thoughts) his hands as well, in
order that no other sovereign should possess works by so consummate
a master of stonecraft. There the disciplinary measures ended. He
did his best to console the gifted artist who was fed,
henceforward, on lobsters, decorated with the order of the Golden
Vine, and would doubtless have been ennobled after death, had the
Prince not predeceased the sculptor.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, is the history of Saint Dodekanus, and the origin
of his cult on Nepenthe.</p>

<p>Legends galore, often contradictory to this account and to one
another, have clustered round his name, as was inevitable. He is
supposed to have preached in Asia Minor; to have died as a young
man, in his convent; to have become a hermit, a cobbler, a bishop
(of Nicomedia), a eunuch, a politician. Two volumes of mediocre
sermons in the Byzantine tongue have been ascribed to him. These
and other crudities may be dismissed as apocryphal. Even his name
has given rise to controversy, although its origin from the Greek
word <i>dodeka</i>, signifying twelve and alluding to the twelve
morsels into which his body was superstitiously divided, is as
self-evident as well can be. Thus a worthy young canon of the
church of Nepenthe, Giacinto Mellino, who has lately written a life
of Saint Eulalia, the local patroness of sailors&mdash;her festival
occurs twelve days after that of Saint Dodekanus&mdash;takes
occasion, in this otherwise commendable pamphlet, to scoff at the
old-established derivation of the name and to propose an
alternative etymology. He lays it down that then pagan inhabitants
of the island, desirous of sharing in the benefits of Christianity
which had already reached the mainland but left untouched their
lonely rock, sent a missive to the bishop containing the two words
<i>Do dekanus</i>: give us a deacon! The grammar is at fault, he
explains, because of their rudimentary knowledge of the Latin
tongue; they had only learnt, hitherto, the first person singular
and the nominative case&mdash;so he says; and then proceeds to
demonstrate, with unanswerable arguments, that Greek was the spoken
language of Nepenthe at this period. Several scholars have been
swayed by his specious logic to abandon the older and sounder
interpretation. There are yet other conjectures about the word
Dodekanus, all more or less fanciful...</p>

<p>If the Crotalophoboi had not devoured the missionary Dodekanus,
we should assuredly never have heard of Monsignor Perrelli, the
learned and genial historian of Nepenthe. It was that story, he
expressly tells us, which inflamed him, a mere visitor to the
place, with a desire to know more about the island. A people like
the Nepentheans, who could cherish in their hearts a tale of such
beauty, must be worthy, he concluded, "of the closest and most
sympathetic scrutiny." Thus, one thing leading to another, as
always happens where local researches are concerned, he soon found
himself collecting other legends, traditions, historical data,
statistics of agriculture and natural productions, and so forth.
The result of these labours was embodied in the renowned
<i>Antiquities of Nepenthe</i>.</p>

<p>This book, a model of its kind, is written in Latin. It seems to
have been the author's only work, and has gone through several
editions; the last one&mdash;by no means the best as regards
typography&mdash;being that of 1709. The Crotalophoboi therefore,
who procured the sanctification of Dodekanus by methods hardly
commendable to decent folks, can be said to have done some good in
the world, if the creation of a literary masterpiece like these
<i>Antiquities</i>, for which they are indirectly responsible, may
be classed under that head.</p>

<p>It is a pity we know so little of the life of this Monsignor
Perrelli. He is disappointingly reticent about himself. We learn
that he was a native of the mainland; that he came here, as a
youth, afflicted with rheumatic troubles; that these troubles were
relived by an application of those health-giving waters which he
lived to describe in one of the happiest sections of his work, and
which were to become famous to the world at large through certain
classical experiments carried out under his contemporary, the Good
Duke Alfred&mdash;a potentate who, by the way, does not seem to
have behaved very prettily to our scholar. And that is absolutely
all we know about him. The most painstaking enquiries on the part
of Mr. Eames have failed to add a single item of positive
information to our knowledge of the historian of Nepenthe. We
cannot tell when, or where, he died. He seems to have ended in
regarding himself as a native of the place. The wealth of material
incorporated in the book leads to the supposition that he must have
spent long years on the island. We may further presume, from his
title, that he belonged to the church; it was the surest path of
advancement for a young man of quality in those days.</p>

<p>A perfunctory glance into his pages will suffice to prove that
he lacked what is called the ecclesiastical bent of mind. Reading
between the lines, one soon discovers that his is not so much a
priest as a statesman and philosopher, a student curious in the
lore of mankind and of nature&mdash;alert, sagacious,
discriminating. He tells us, for example, that this legend of the
visions and martyrdom of Saint Dodekanus, which he was the first to
disentangle from its heterogeneous accretions, was vastly to his
liking. Why? Because of its churchly flavour? Not so; but because
he detected therein "truth and symbol. It is a tale of universal
applicability; the type, as it were, of every great man's life,
endeavour, and reward." The introduction to these
<i>Antiquities</i>, setting forth his maxims for the writing of
history, might have been composed not three centuries ago, but
yesterday&mdash;or even to-morrow; so modern is its note.</p>

<p>Hearken to these weighty words:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Portraiture of characters and events should
take the form of one gentleman conversing with another, in the easy
tone of good society. The author who sets out to address a crowd
defeats his own object; he eliminates the essence of good
writing&mdash;frankness. You cannot be frank with men of low
condition. You must presuppose a refined and congenial listener, a
man or woman whom you would not hesitate to take by the hand and
lead into the circle of your own personal friends. If this applies
to literature of every kind, it applies to history in a peculiar
degree.<br>
<br>
"History deals with situations and figures not imaginary but real.
It demands therefore a combination of qualities unnecessary to the
poet or writer of romance&mdash;glacial judgment coupled with
fervent sympathy. The poet may be an inspired illiterate, the
romance-writer an uninspired hack. Under no circumstances can
either of them be accused of wronging or deceiving the public,
however incongruous their efforts. They write well or badly, and
there the matter ends. The historian, who fails in his duty,
deceives the reader and wrongs the dead. A man weighted with such
responsibilities is deserving of an audience more than usually
select&mdash;an audience of his equals, men of the world. No
vulgarian can be admitted to share those confidences...<br>
<br>
"The Greeks figured forth a Muse of History; they dared express
their opinions. Genesis, that ancient barrier, did not exist for
them. It stands in the way of the modern historian; it involves him
in a ceaseless conflict with his own honesty. If he values his
skin, he must accommodate himself to current dogmas and refrain
from truthful comments and conclusions. He has the choice of being
a chronologer or a ballad-monger-obsolete and unimportant
occupations. Unenviable fate of those who aspire to be teachers of
mankind, that they themselves should be studied with a kind of
antiquarian interest, stimulating thought not otherwise than as
warning examples! Clio has fallen from her pedestal. That radiant
creature, in identifying her interests with those of theocracy, has
become the hand-maiden of a withered and petulant mistress, a
mercenary slut. So things will remain, till mankind has acquired a
fresh body of ethics, corresponding to modern needs. It is useless,
it is dangerous, to pour new wine into old bottles..."</p>

<p>He carries out his theory. The work of Monsignor Perrelli is,
above all things, a human document&mdash;the revelation of a
personality cultured and free from prejudice. Indeed, when one
considers the religious situation of those days, he seems to be
sailing perilously near the wind in some of his theological
reflections; so much so, that Mr. Eames often wondered whether this
might not account for our ignorance of his later life and the
manner of his death. He held it possible that the scholar may have
fallen into the clutches of the Inquisition, never again to return
to the surface of society. It would explain why the first edition
of the <i>Antiquities</i> is so extremely rare, and why the two
subsequent ones were issued, respectively, at Amsterdam and
Bale.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the book contains in its nine hundred pages all
that could possibly interest a contemporary student about the
history and natural products of Nepenthe. It is still a mine of
antiquarian information, though large sections of the work have
inevitably become obsolete. To bring the <i>Antiquities</i> up to
date by means of a revised and enlarged version enriched with
footnotes, appendixes and copious illustrations, was the ambition,
the sole ambition, of Mr. Ernest Eames, R.A...</p>

<p>It was not true to say of this gentleman that he fled from
England to Nepenthe because he forged his mother's will, because he
was arrested while picking the pockets of a lady at Tottenham Court
Road Station, because he refused to pay for the upkeep of his seven
illegitimate children, because he was involved in a flamboyant
scandal of unmentionable nature and unprecedented dimensions,
because he was detected while trying to poison the rhinoceros at
the Zoo with an arsenical bun, because he strangled his mistress,
because he addressed an almost disrespectful letter to the Primate
of England beginning "My good Owl"&mdash;or for any suchlike
reason; and that he now remained on the island only because nobody
was fool enough to lend him the ten pounds requisite for a ticket
back again.</p>

<p>He came there originally to save money; and he stayed there
originally because, if he had happened to die on his homeward
journey, there would not have been enough coppers in his pocket to
pay for the funeral expenses. Nowadays, having solved the problem
of how to live on 85 pounds a year, he stayed for another reason as
well: to annotate Perrelli's <i>Antiquities</i>. It sweetened his
self-imposed exile.</p>

<p>He was a dry creature, almost wizened, with bright eyes and a
short moustache; unostentatiously dressed; fastidious, reserved,
genteel, precise in manner, and living a retired life in a
two-roomed cottage somewhere among the vineyards.</p>

<p>He had taken a high degree in classics, though Greek was never
much to his taste. It was "runaway stuff"; nervous and sensuous; it
opened up too many vistas, philological and social, for his
positive mind to assimilate with comfort. Those particles
alone&mdash;there was something ambiguous, something almost
disreputable, in their jocund pliability, their readiness to lend
themselves to improper uses. But Latin&mdash;ah, Latin was
different! Even at his preparatory school, where he was known as a
swot of the first water, he had displayed an unhealthy infatuation
for that tongue; he loved its cold, lapidary construction; and
while other boys played football or cricket, this withered little
fellow used to lark about with a note-book, all by himself,
torturing sensible English into its refractory and colourless
periods and elaborating, without the help of a Gradus, those inept
word-mosaics which are called Latin verses. "Good fun," he used to
say, "and every bit as exciting as algebra," as though that
constituted a recommendation. Often the good form master shook his
head, and enquired anxiously whether he was feeling unwell, or had
secret troubles of any kind.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," he would then reply, with a funny little laugh.
"Thank you, sir. But please, sir! Would you mind telling me whether
<i>pecunia</i> really comes from <i>pecus</i>? Because Adams minor
(another swot) says it doesn't."</p>

<p>Later on, at the University, he used the English language for
the sake of convenience&mdash;in order to make himself understood
by Dons and Heads of Colleges. His thoughts, his dreams, were in
Latin.</p>

<p>Such a man, arriving almost penniless on Nepenthe, might have
passed a torpid month or two, then drifted into the Club-set and
gone to the dogs altogether. Latin saved him. He took to studying
those earlier local writers who often composed in that tongue. The
Jesuitical smoothness, the saccharine felicity of authors like
Giannettasio had just begun to pall on his fancy, when the
<i>Antiquities</i> fell into his hands. It was like a draught of
some generous southern wine, after a course of barley-water. Here
was Latin worth reading; rich, sinewy, idiomatic, full of flavour,
masculine. Flexible, yet terse. Latin after his own heart; a cry
across the centuries!</p>

<p>So bewitched was Mr. Eames with the grammar and syntax of the
<i>Antiquities</i> that he had already gone through the book three
times ere realizing that this man, who could construct such
flowing, glowing sentences, was actually writing about something.
Yes, he had something of uncommon interest to impart. And a
gentleman, by Jove! So different from what one runs up against
nowadays. He had an original way of looking at things&mdash;a human
way. Very human. Those quaint streaks of credulity, those whimsical
blasphemies, those spicy Court anecdotes dropped, as it were, in
the smoking room of a patrician club&mdash;a rare old fellow! He
would have given anything to have made his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Forthwith a change came over Mr. Ernest Eames. His frozen
classical mind blossomed under the sunny stimulus of the
Renaissance scholar. He entered upon a second boyhood&mdash;a real
boyhood, this time, full of enthusiasms and adventures into flowery
by-paths of learning. Monsignor Perrelli absorbed him. He absorbed
Monsignor Perrelli. Marginal observation led to footnotes;
footnotes to appendixes. He had found an interest in life. He would
annotate the <i>Antiquities</i>.</p>

<p>In the section which deals with the life of Saint Dodekanus the
Italian had displayed more than his usual erudition and acumen. He
had sifted the records with such incredible diligence that little
was left for the pen of an annotator, save words of praise. In two
small matters, however, the Englishman, considerably to his regret,
was enabled or rather obliged to add a postscript.</p>

<p>Many a time he cursed the day when his researches among the
archives of the mainland brought him into contact with the
unpublished chronicle of Father Capocchio, a Dominican friar of
licorous and even licentious disposition, a hater of Nepenthe and a
personal enemy, it seemed, of his idol Perrelli. His
manuscript&mdash;the greater part of it, at all events&mdash;was
not fit to be printed; not fit to be touched by respectable people.
Mr. Eames felt it his duty to waive considerations of delicacy. In
his capacity of annotator he would have plunged headlong into the
Augean stables, had there been any likelihood of extracting
therefrom the germs of a luminous footnote. He perused the
manuscript, making notes as he went along. This wretched monk, he
concluded, must have possessed a damnably intimate knowledge of
Nepenthean conditions, and a cantankerous and crapulous turn of
mind, into the bargain. He never lost an opportunity of denigrating
the island; he was determined, absolutely determined, to see only
the bad side of things, so far as that place was concerned.</p>

<p>Regarding the pious relic, for instance,&mdash;the thigh-bone of
the saint, preserved in the principal church&mdash;he wrote:</p>

<p>"A certain Perrelli who calls himself historian, which is as
though one should call a mule a horse, or an ass a mule, brays
loudly and disconnectedly about the femur of the local god. We have
personally examined this priceless femur. It is not a femur, but a
tibia. And it is the tibia not of a saint, but of a young cow or
calf. We may mention, in passing, that we hold a diploma in anatomy
from the Palermitan Faculty of Medicine."</p>

<p>That was Father Capocchio's way: bald to coarseness, whenever he
lacked occasion to be obscene.</p>

<p>To Mr. Eames it would have mattered little, <i>a priori</i>,
whether the relic was a femur or a tibia, a cow or man. In this
case, he liked to think it was the thigh-bone of a saint. He
possessed an unusually strong dose of that Latin <i>pietas</i>,
that reverence which consists in leaving things as they are,
particularly when they have been described for the benefit of
posterity, with the most engaging candour, by a man of Perrelli's
calibre. Now an insinuation like this could not be slurred over. It
was a downright challenge! The matter must be thrashed out. For
four months he poured over books on surgery and anatomy. Then,
having acquired a knowledge of the subject&mdash;adequate, though
necessarily superficial&mdash;he applied to the ecclesiastical
authorities for permission to view the relic. It was politely
refused. The saintly object, they declared, could only be exhibited
to persons professing the Roman Catholic Faith, and armed with a
special recommendation from the bishop.</p>

<p>"These," he used to say, "are the troubles which lie in wait for
a conscientious annotator."</p>

<p>On another point, that of a derivation of the saint's name, he
was pained to discover in the pages of Father Capocchio an
alternative suggestion, of which more anon. It caused him many
sleepless nights. But on matters pertaining to the climate of
Nepenthe, its inhabitants, products, minerals, water-supply,
fisheries, trade, folk-lore, ethnology,&mdash;on questions such as
these he had gathered much fresh information. Sheaves of
stimulating footnotes had accumulated on his desk.</p>

<p>When would all this material be published?</p>

<p>Mr. Eames had not the faintest idea. Meanwhile he calmly went on
collecting and collecting, and collecting. Something might turn up,
one of these days. Everybody with the slightest pretensions to
scholarship was interested in his work; many friends had made him
offers of pecuniary assistance towards the printing of a book which
could not be expected to be a source of profit to its publisher;
the wealthy and good-natured Mr. Keith, in particular, used to
complain savagely and very sincerely at not being allowed to assist
to the extent of a hundred or two. There were days on which he
seemed to yield to these arguments; days when he expanded and gave
rein to his fancy, smiling in anticipation of that noble
volume&mdash;the golden Latinity of Monsignor Perrelli enriched
with twenty-five years' patient labour on the part of himself; days
when he would go so far as to discuss prospective contracts, and
bindings and photogravures, and margins, and paper. Everything, of
course, was to be of appropriate quality&mdash;not pretentious, but
distinguished. Oh, yes! A book of that kind&mdash;it must have a
cachet of its own...</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he would observe that he was joking; only
joking.</p>

<p>The true Mr. Eames revealed and reasserted himself. He shrank
from the idea. He closed up like a flower in the chill of
night-fall. He was not going to put himself under obligations to
anybody. He would keep his sense of personal independence, even if
it entailed the sacrifice of a life's ambition. Owe no man
anything! The words rang in his ears. They were his father's words.
Owe no man anything! They were that gentleman's definition of a
gentleman&mdash;a definition which was cordially approved by every
other gentleman who, like Mr. Eames junior, happened to hold
analogous views.</p>

<p>Gentlemen being rather scarce nowadays, we cannot but feel
grateful to the Crotalophoboi for devouring Saint Dodekanus and
paving the way, <i>via</i> the <i>Antiquities</i> of Monsignor
Perrelli, for the refined personality of Mr. Eames&mdash;even if
such was not their original intention.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c04.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Next morning, at precisely 4 a.m., there was an earthquake.</p>

<p>Foreigners unaccustomed to Nepenthean conditions rushed in their
pyjamas out of doors, to escape the falling wreckage. An American
lady, staying at Mr. Muhlen's high-class hotel, jumped from her
bed-room on the third floor into the courtyard below, and narrowly
escaped bruising her ankle.</p>

<p>It was a false alarm. The sudden clanging of every bell on the
place, the explosion of twelve hundred mortars and the simultaneous
booming of an enormous cannon&mdash;that far-famed gun whose
wayward tricks had cost the lives of hundreds of its loaders in the
days of the Good Duke&mdash;might have passed for an earthquake of
the first magnitude, so far as noise and concussion were concerned.
The island rocked to its foundations. It was the signal for the
festival of the patron saint to begin.</p>

<p>Nobody could have slept through that din. Mr. Heard, dog-tired
as he was, woke up and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Things are happening here," he said&mdash;a remark which he
found himself repeating on several later occasions.</p>

<p>He looked round the room. It was not an hotel bed-room. Then he
began to remember things, drowsily. He remembered the pleasant
surprise of the previous evening&mdash;how the Duchess had called
to mind a small villa, vacated earlier than she had expected by a
lady friend for whom she had taken it. It was furnished, spotlessly
clean, with a woman, a capable cook, in attendance. She had
insisted on his living there.</p>

<p>"So much nicer than a dreadful room in an hotel! You'll show the
bishop all over it, won't you, Denis?"</p>

<p>Walking together, he and Denis, they had been overtaken by
another recent visitor to Nepenthe. It was Mr. Edgar Marten. Mr.
Marten was a hirsute and impecunious young Hebrew of low tastes,
with a passion for mineralogy. He had profited by some University
grant to make certain studies at Nepenthe which was renowned for
its variegated rocks. There was something striking about him,
thought Mr. Heard. He said little of consequence, but Denis
listened enthusiastically to his abstruse remarks about fractures
and so forth, and watched with eagerness as he poked his stick into
the rough walls to dislodge some stone that seemed to be of
interest.</p>

<p>"So you don't know the difference between augite and
hornblende?" he once enquired. "Really? Dash my eyes! How old did
you say you were?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen."</p>

<p>"And what have you been doing, Phipps, these last nineteen
years?"</p>

<p>"One can't know everything at my age."</p>

<p>"Granted. But I think you might have learnt that much. Come to
me on Thursday morning. I'll see what I can do for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard rather admired this youthful scientist. The fellow
knew what he was after; he was after stones. Perfect of his
kind&mdash;a condition which always appealed to the bishop.
Pleasant youngsters, both of them. And so different from each
other!</p>

<p>As to Denis&mdash;he could not make up his mind about Denis. To
begin with, he exhaled that peculiar College aroma which the most
heroic efforts of a lifetime often fail to dissipate. Then, he had
said something about Florence, and Cinque-Cento, and Jacopo
Bellini. The bishop, a practical man, had not much use for Jacopo
Bellini or for people who talked about him. None the less, while
making himself useful with unpacking and arranging things, Denis
dropped a remark which struck Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"The canvas of Nepenthe," he observed, "is rather
overcharged."</p>

<p>Rather overcharged...</p>

<p>It was true, thought the bishop, as he glanced out of his window
that evening, all alone, over the sea into which a young moon was
just sinking to rest. Overcharged! A ceaseless ebb and flow of
humanity surged before his weary eyes. That sense of irreality
which had struck him on his first view of the island was still
persisting; the south wind, no doubt, helped this illusion. He
remembered the general affluence and kindliness of the people;
that, at least, had made a definite mark upon his mind. He liked
the place. Already he felt at home here, and in better health. But
when he tried to conjure up some definite impression of town and
people, the images became blurred; the smiling priest, the Duchess,
Mr. Keith&mdash;they were like figures in a dream; they merged into
memories of Africa, of his fellow-passengers from Zanzibar; they
mingled with projects relating to his own future in
England&mdash;projects relating to his cousin on Nepenthe. Mr.
Heard felt exhausted.</p>

<p>He was too tired to be greatly affected by that cannonade, which
was enough to rouse the dead. Something must be happening, he
mused; then, his meditations concluded, turned on his other side.
He slept well into the morning, and found his breakfast
appetisingly laid out in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>And now, he thought, for that procession.</p>

<p>Bells were ringing gaily into the sunshine. From a long way off,
he discerned the brazen tones of a band, the chanting of priests
and townspeople, shrill voices of women. The pageant came in
sight&mdash;winding its way through the multitudes under the
beflagged arches of greenery, while a rain of flowers descended
from windows and balconies overhead. Clusters of children went
before, in many-tinted array, according to their various schools or
confraternities. Then came the municipal band in uniform, playing
the cheeriest of tunes, and escorted by the Nepenthe militia whose
old-fashioned costume of silver and scarlet was most effective. The
authorities of the island trod on their heels&mdash;grave gentlemen
in black clothes, some of them adorned with ribbons and
decorations. The Mephistophelean judge, the freethinker, was among
them; he limped along, expectorating every ten yards or so,
presumably to mark his displeasure at being obliged, as official,
to attend a religious function. The Commissioner, too, was in the
ranks. He appeared just the same as yesterday; very informal in his
knickerbockers, and decidedly pink about the gills.</p>

<p>There followed a long train of priests, clad in lace and silken
garments of every hue. They looked like a perambulating
flower-garden. Plump, jovial fellows&mdash;chanting blithely, and
occasionally exchanging a few words with one another. Don Francesco
glittered in crimson vestments; he recognized Mr. Heard, and gave
him a broad smile combined with something which might have been
mistaken for a wink. The huge silver statue of the saint came next.
It was a grotesque monster, borne aloft on a wooden platform that
wobbled on the shoulders of eight lusty perspiring carriers. As it
passed, all the onlookers raised their hats; all save the Russians,
the Little White Cows who, standing aside with wonderment written
on their childlike faces, were relieved from this necessity, since
the wearing of hats had been forbidden by their leader, their
self-styled Messiah, the divinely inspired Bazhakuloff; they were
to go bareheaded summer and winter, "like the Christians of old."
Some ardent believers went so far as to kneel on the stony ground.
The Duchess, the Catholic-to-be, had assumed this reverend posture;
she was on the other side of the street, surrounded by a number of
ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Heard, reviewing the crowd, abandoned the
idea of piercing that procession and exchanging a few words with
her. He would see her in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then the bishop&mdash;the dignitary whom Don Francesco had
called "not exactly a liberal." He tallied with that description. A
wicked old face! He was blear-eyed, brown as a mummy, and so fat
that his legs had long ago ceased to be any use save as a
precarious support while standing. He rode, in gorgeous apparel, on
a milk-white donkey which was led by two pretty choristers in blue.
Attached to the end of a long pole, a green umbrella of Gargantuan
proportions, adorned with red tassels, protected his wrinkled head
from the rays of the sun. One hand clutched some religious object
upon which his eyes were glued in a hypnotic trance, the other
cruised aimlessly about the horizon, in the act of benediction.</p>

<p>Mumbo-jumbo, thought Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>Yet he looked without wincing at the caricature of Christianity.
It was like an act in a pantomime. He had seen funnier things in
Africa. Among the Bitongos, for instance. They would have enjoyed
this procession, the Bitongos. They were Christians; had taken to
the Gospel like ducks to the water; wore top-hats at Easter. But
liars&mdash;such dreadful liars! Just the reverse of the M'tezo.
Ah, those M'tezo! Incurable heathen. He had given them up long ago.
Anyhow, they despised lying. They filed their teeth, ate their
superfluous female relations, swopped wives every new moon, and
never wore a stitch of clothes. A man who appeared among the M'tezo
in a fig-leaf would find himself in the cooking-pot within five
minutes.</p>

<p>How they attached themselves to his heart, those black fellows.
Such healthy animals! This spectacle, he discovered, was rather
like Africa&mdash;the same steamy heat, the same blaring noises,
dazzling light, and glowing colours; the same spirit of
unconquerable playfulness in grave concerns.</p>

<p>And the Bumbulis, the Kubangos, the Mugwambas! And the
Bulanga&mdash;that tribe whom Mr. Keith seemed to know so well!
Really, the Bulanga were the worst of the lot. Not fit to be talked
about. And yet, somehow or other, one could not help liking
them...</p>

<p>"Good morning, Bishop!" said a voice at his side. It was Mr.
Keith. He looked well washed and chubby in his spotless white
clothes. Accompanying him was a friend in grey flannels whom he
presently introduced as Mr. Eames. "Hope you slept well," he went
on. "And how do you like the procession? You are doing quite the
right thing in attending. Oh, quite. That is why I am here, though
I don't much fancy these ceremonies. One ought to conform to
custom. Well, what are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Africa, and the pain which the natives will
endure for what they call their pleasures. I wonder how much those
men are paid for carrying that statue? They perspire pretty
freely."</p>

<p>"They are paid nothing. They pay, themselves, a heavy sum for
the privilege."</p>

<p>"You surprise me!"</p>

<p>"They have remission of sins; they can be as naughty as ever
they like for a twelvemonth afterwards. That is a consideration. I
will tell you something else about that idol. It is five hundred
years old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" interposed Mr. Eames, in a tone of gentle
remonstrance. "The saint was cast exactly eighty-two years ago;
they used to have a wooden one before that time. Anybody can see
from the workmanship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have it your way, Eames. Eighty-two years old, I was going to
say, and not yet paid for. They want some rich foreigner to produce
the money. They are counting on van Koppen, just now; an American
millionaire, you know, who comes here every year and spends a good
deal of money. But I know old Koppen. He is no fool. By the way,
Eames, what do you think of this discovery of mine? Of course you
have heard of the James-Lange theory of the Emotions, namely, that
bodily changes follow directly on the perception of the existing
fact and that our feeling of these same changes as they occur is
the Emotion. They developed the theory independently, and got great
credit for it. Well, I find&mdash;what nobody seems to have
noticed&mdash;that they were anticipated by Professor Maudsley.
I've got a note of it in my pocket. Here you are. <i>Psychology of
Mind</i>, 1876, pages 472-4 <i>et seq</i>.; 372, 384, 386-7 <i>et
passim</i>. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I am not interested in psychology. You know it
perfectly well.</p>

<p>"Why not? Wouldn't you get more fun out of life if you
were?"</p>

<p>"I have Perrelli."</p>

<p>"Always your old Perrelli! That reminds me, Eames. I mean to
talk to van Koppen as soon as he arrives about getting that book of
yours published. He is good for any amount. Koppen is your
man."</p>

<p>There was a mischievous twinkle in his eye, as he said this.</p>

<p>"Please don't," implored Mr. Eames. "You will annoy me very
seriously."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, my poor fellow."</p>

<p>"You can't think how much you will annoy me! How often have I
told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you must lunch with me to-day, together with the bishop.
Don't trouble about driving to the Old Town to see your cousin," he
added to Mr. Heard. "She is sure to be at the reception of the
Duchess this afternoon."</p>

<p>Mr. Eames said:</p>

<p>"So sorry. I must get back home. I only came out to speak to a
man about a collar&mdash;for my dog, I mean. Another day, if you
don't mind. And no millionaires, whatever you do!"</p>

<p>He departed, rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>"He is shy," Keith explained. "But he can tell you all about the
island. And now come home with me, Bishop. I feel as if it were
time for luncheon. It must be about half-past twelve."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard took out his watch.</p>

<p>"Half-past twelve to the minute," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought so. A man's best clock is his stomach. We have only a
few hundred yards to go. Hot, isn't it? This infernal south
wind..."</p>

<p>The Villa Khismet was one of the surprises of Nepenthe. It lay
somewhat out of the way, at the end of a narrow, gloomy and
tortuous lane. Who would have dreamt of finding a house of this
kind in such a situation? Who would have expected, on passing
through that mouldy wooden gateway in the wall, to find himself in
a courtyard that recalled the exquisite proportions and traceries
of the Alhambra&mdash;to be able to wander thence under fretted
arches through a maze of marble-paved Moorish chambers, great and
small, opening upon each other at irregular angles with a
deliciously impromptu effect? The palace had been built regardless
of expense. It was originally laid out, Keith explained, by one of
the old rulers of Nepenthe who, to tease his faithful subjects,
simulated a frenzied devotion for the poetry and architecture of
the Saracens, their bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>Something Oriental still hung about these chambers, though the
modern furniture was not at all in keeping with the style. Mr.
Keith did not profess to be a man of taste. "I try to be
comfortable," he used to say. He succeeded in being luxurious.</p>

<p>They glanced into the garden&mdash;a spacious park-like
enclosure terminating in a declivity, so as to afford a view over
the sea far below. It was a mock wilderness of trees and bright
blossoms, flooded in meridian sunlight. Some gardeners moved about,
binding up the riotous vegetation that had sprouted overnight under
the moist breath of the sirocco.</p>

<p>"It's too hot to think of lunching out here," said Keith. "You
should come and see this place in the evening."</p>

<p>"It must be wonderful at that hour."</p>

<p>"Still more wonderful in the early morning, or by moonlight. But
then I am generally alone. There are twenty-four fountains in this
garden," he added. "They might help to keep the place cool. But of
course not one of them is in use now. You have observed, have you
not, that there is no running water on this island? That old Duke
built the fountains all the same, and to every one of them he
attached a cistern, to hold the winter rains; then a pumping
apparatus. Relays of slaves had to work underground, day and night,
pumping water for these twenty-four fountains; it fell back into
the cisterns, and was forced up again. The Arabs had fountains. He
meant to have them too. Particularly at night! If anything went
wrong with the machinery at that hour, there was the devil to pay.
He swore he could not sleep unless he heard the music of the water.
And his sleepless nights were bad for his subjects. They generally
hid in caves till the fountains were reported to be in working
order again. That is the way to run an island, Mr. Heard. One must
be a stylist."</p>

<p>"You might re-activate one of them, at least, with the help of
those servants."</p>

<p>"They have enough to do, I assure you, to re-activate
me&mdash;keep me young and in good condition. To say nothing of the
flowers, which also need a little friendly attention..."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c05.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Mr. Heard enjoyed that luncheon. "The food, the wine, the
service&mdash;they were faultless; something altogether out of the
way," he declared with frank conviction.</p>

<p>"Then you must come again," replied his host. "How long did you
say you were staying here?"</p>

<p>"Ten days or so. It depends upon Mrs. Meadows and her movements.
I understand she is all alone up there, in the clouds. Her
husband's leave has been postponed for the second time. He was
going to pick her up on his way to England. She had to leave India
before him, on account of the child."</p>

<p>"A pretty baby. Couldn't stand the climate, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Exactly. My mother asked me to look in and cheer her up a
little, and perhaps take her back with me. And really," he added,
"it's rather awkward! I have not seen my cousin since she was a
little girl. What does she look like?"</p>

<p>"Tailor-made. Looks as if she rode well and knew her own mind.
Looks as if she had been through a good deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"I daresay she has. She was always impetuous, even as a child.
That first marriage was not at all a success. Some foreign
scoundrel who deserted her and vanished. I was in China at the
time, but my mother wrote me about it."</p>

<p>"A first marriage? She never told me about that."</p>

<p>"This second one was a love match. They ran away together. They
must have had a hard time out there at first, living as they did.
No doubt she has learnt to know her own mind; one has to cope with
emergencies in a life like that. He has done well, I hear. A
charming fellow, from all accounts, though I question whether they
are properly married even now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they can't be," replied Mr. Keith, "in view of the
earlier affair. But how will they educate that boy, in India? It
can't be done. India is no better than Bampopo, for such purposes.
Did you do much educational work in Africa? I hope you were gentle
with my friends the Bulaga?"</p>

<p>"We baptized two or three hundred of them one day. But they
behaved shockingly the very next week&mdash;quite disgracefully!
They are hopeless, those friends of yours, though one cannot help
liking them somehow. I got through good deal of other work of that
kind," he added.</p>

<p class="caption">The Duchess of San Martino</p>

<p>"I see you are a man of action. Sometimes I wish I were. A
little money has made me lazy, I'm afraid. But I do some thinking,
and a fair lot of reading. I travel, I observe, I compare. Among
other things I observe that our English system of education is all
wrong. We ought to return to that old Camp-and-Court ideal."</p>

<p>"All wrong?" queried the bishop.</p>

<p>"Take a case like that young fellow Denis. What is a child of
his age doing at a University? No. If I had a son&mdash;but I am
boring you."</p>

<p>"I have not been bored since I was twenty."</p>

<p>"I wish I could say the same of myself. I grow more intolerant
of fools as the years roll on. If I had a son, I was saying, I
would take him from school at the age of fourteen, not a moment
later, and put him for two years in a commercial house. Wake him
up; make an English citizen of him. Teach him how to deal with men
as men, to write a straightforward business letter, manage his own
money and gain some respect for those industrial movements which
control the world. Next, two years in some wilder part of the
world, where his own countrymen and equals by birth are settled
under primitive conditions, and have formed their rough codes of
society. The intercourse with such people would be a capital
invested for life. The next two years should be spent in the great
towns of Europe, in order to remove awkwardness of manner,
prejudices of race and feeling, and to get the outward forms of a
European citizen. All this would sharpen his wits, give him more
interest in life, more keys to knowledge. It would widen his
horizon. Then, and not a minute sooner, to the University, where he
would go not as a child but a man capable of enjoying its real
advantages, attend lectures with profit, acquire manners instead of
mannerisms and a University tone instead of a University taint.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"It sounds a trifle revolutionary," commented the bishop, with a
smile. "But it appeals to me. Education is a matter than lies very
near my heart. In fact, I had some thoughts of retiring from the
Church and devoting myself to it. I feel, I don't know why, as if I
could do more in that direction."</p>

<p>Keith merely observed:</p>

<p>"That is interesting. Perhaps you have reached the end of the
Church."</p>

<p>He liked this young Colonial bishop, and his straightforward,
earnest face. Being of a complicated nature himself, he was always
drawn towards men of single aims and purposes.</p>

<p>The other would have been pleased to know why Keith found it
"interesting" and what he meant by that other phrase, but forbore
to inquire. He was rather a silent man, though not deficient in
mother wit. He lit a cigarette, and waited.</p>

<p>"Let us discourse of education!" said his host with that
elaborate manner which the bishop afterwards discovered to be
peculiar to him. "I think we need not differentiate between the
sexes. In proportion as more careers are opened to women, their
teaching will tend to converge with that of men. That specifically
female education in domestic arts has been rendered superfluous by
commercial products. I will tell you what I think. A sound
schooling should teach manner of thought rather than matter. It
should have a dual aim&mdash;to equip a man for hours of work, and
for hours of leisure. They interact; if the leisure is misspent,
the work will suffer. As regards the first, we cannot expect a
school to purvey more than a grip of general principles. Even that
is seldom given. The second should enable a man to extract as much
happiness as possible out of his spare time. The secret of
happiness is curiosity. Now curiosity is not only not roused; it is
repressed. You will say there is not time for everything. But how
much time is wasted! Mathematics...A medieval halo clings round
this subject which, as a training for the mind, has no more value
than whist-playing. I wonder how many excellent public servants
have been lost to England because, however accomplished, they
lacked the mathematical twist required to pass the standard in this
one subject? As a training in intelligence it is harmful: it
teaches a person to underestimate the value of evidence based on
their other modes of ratiocination. It is the poorest form of
mental exercise&mdash;sheer verification; conjecture and
observation are ruled out. A study of Chinese grammar would be far
more valuable from the point of view of general education. All
mathematics above the standard of the office boy should be a
special subject, like dynamics or hydrostatics. They are useless to
the ordinary man. If you mention the utility of a mathematician
like Isaac Newton, don't forget that it was his pre-eminently
anti-mathematical gift for drawing conclusions from analogy which
made him what he was. And Euclid&mdash;that frowsy anachronism! One
might as well teach Latin by the system of Donatus. Surely all
knowledge is valueless save as a guide to conduct? A guide ought to
be up to date and convenient to handle. Euclid is a museum
specimen. Half the time wasted over these subjects should be
devoted to draughtmanship and object-lessons. I don't know why we
disparage object-lessons; they were recommended by people like
Bacon, Amos Commenius and Pestalozzi. They are far superior to
mathematics as a means of developing the reasoning powers; they can
be made as complex as you please; they discipline the eye and mind,
teach a child to discriminate between the accidental and the
essential, and demand lucidity of thought and expression. And the
hours spent over history! What on earth does it matter who Henry
the Twelfth's wife was? Chemistry! All this, relatively speaking,
is unprofitable stuff. How much better to teach the elements of
sociology and jurisprudence. The laws that regulate human
intercourse; what could be more interesting? And
physiology&mdash;the disrespect for the human frame is another
relic of monasticism. In fact our whole education is tainted with
the monkish spirit. Divinity! Has any purpose ever been
served&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Keith sighed.</p>

<p>"I wish I had not eaten so many of those prawns," he added.
"What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"I think modern education over-emphasizes the intellect. I
suppose that comes from the scientific trend of the times. You
cannot obtain a useful citizen if you only develop his intellect.
We take children from their parents because these cannot give them
an intellectual training. So far, good. But we fail to give them
that training in character which parents alone can give. Home
influence, as Grace Aguilar conceived it&mdash;where has it gone?
It strikes me that this is a grave danger for the future. We are
rearing up a brood of crafty egoists, a generation whose earliest
recollections are those of getting something for nothing from the
State. I am inclined to trace our present social unrest to this
over-valuation of the intellect. It hardens the heart and blights
all generous impulses. What is going to replace the home, Mr.
Keith? And there is another point which has often forced itself
upon me. A certain proportion of wealthy children tend to fall back
into lower grades of life&mdash;manual labour, and so forth. They
are born below the level of their parents. No difficulty about
relapsing. But a fair percentage of the lowest classes tend to
rise; they stand, potentially, above their surroundings. An
apparatus has been contrived for catching these children. But it is
defective, because devoid of sympathy. I have known hundreds of
cases in the East End of London where families have been unable to
raise themselves by this means because, at the critical moment,
there was not twenty shillings in the house wherewith to buy
clothes in which the child could present himself to a good employer
with any prospect of success. Worthy of a better fate, he is pushed
back. The chance is missed; the family remains in poverty. All
kinds of profitable and honourable capacities are being wasted in
this fashion every day&mdash;peculiar aptitudes for mechanics,
talents for art, or music, or acting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Acting!" interrupted Keith. "I am glad you reminded me. We are
just in time to see some theatricals at the municipality. They only
come off once a year. It would never do for you to miss them. No,
never."</p>

<p>The bishop, rather regretfully, rose from his seat. He was
feeling comfortable just then, and inclined to listen to a few more
of Keith's educational heresies. But that gentleman seemed to have
exhausted the subject, or himself.</p>

<p>"It's only a few minutes' walk," he observed. "We'll take a
couple of sunshades."</p>

<p>They stepped into the broiling heat. The morning mists had
rolled away from the mountains.</p>

<p>Walking along, Mr. Heard began to realize what a rambling and
craggy sort of place this was. And how decorative! Almost operatic.
The town was full of surprises&mdash;of unexpected glimpses upon a
group of slender palms, some gleaming precipice, or the distant
sea. Gardens appeared to be toppling over the houses; green vines
festooned the doorways and gaily coloured porches; streets climbed
up and down, noisy with rattling carriages and cries of
fruit-vendors who exposed their wares of brightest hues on the
pavement. Country women, in picturesque cinnamon-coloured skirts,
moved gravely among the citizens. The houses, when not whitewashed,
showed their building stone of red volcanic tufa; windows were
aflame with cacti and carnations; slumberous oranges glowed in
courtyards; the roadways underfoot were of lava&mdash;pitch-black.
It was a brilliant medley, overhung by a deep blue sky. The canvas
was indeed overcharged, as Denis had said.</p>

<p>"There are no half-tones in this landscape," the bishop remarked
to Mr. Keith. "No compromise!"</p>

<p>"And yet perfect harmony. They are all true colours. I hate
compromise. It is one of the curses of life. That is why I cannot
endure England for long. The country is full of half-tones, not
only in nature. Because a thing seems good, there must be some bad
in it. It seems bad to us&mdash;therefore it must be good for us.
Bedlamites! I like clean values. They make for clean thinking. This
is the only day in the year," he went on, "when you will see the
population abroad at this hour. The streets are generally quite
empty. It is the only day when I would forgo my afternoon nap on
Nepenthe."</p>

<p>"Nearly three o'clock," said the bishop, consulting his watch.
"What a queer time for theatricals!"</p>

<p>"That Duke again. You can ask Eames about him, he must have been
a man worth knowing. He always slept in the afternoons. It annoyed
him to think that his people slept too. He might suddenly want them
for something, he said. He commanded that they should stay awake,
and decapitated several hundred who were found napping. When he saw
that the habit was ingrained in their natures and that nothing
would avail save a total extermination of the populace, he gave
way, gracefully. Then he instituted these popular theatricals in
honour of the Patron Saint, and fixed them irrevocably for the hour
of three o'clock. He meant to keep his faithful subjects awake on
one afternoon of the year, at all events. He took it for granted
that they could never resist a performance of this kind. He was
right. He knew his people! That was ages ago. We shall find the
place crammed this afternoon."</p>

<p>There was barely standing room, in spite of the sirocco heat.
Mr. Keith, by means of some mysterious formula, soon procured two
seats in the front row, the occupants of which smilingly took their
places among the crowd at the back.</p>

<p>The bishop found himself sitting between his host and a
distinguished-looking elderly gentleman who turned out to be Count
Caloveglia. He was dressed in black. There was something alert and
military in that upright carriage, those keen eyes, bushy black
brows and snowy mustache. He uttered a few pleasant remarks on
making Mr. Heard's acquaintance, but soon relapsed into silence.
Absorbed in the spectacle, he sat motionless, his chin resting in
the hollow of his right hand.</p>

<p>"A fine type," Keith whispered into the bishop's ear. "You will
like him. I call him the Salt of the South. If you are interested
in the old Greek life of these regions&mdash;well, he gives you an
idea of those people. He is the epitome of the Ionian spirit. I'll
take you up to see him one of these days."</p>

<p>The performance consisted of a series of twelve scenes without
words, representing the twelve chief episodes in the life of the
Patron Saint, as portrayed in a certain marble frieze in the
church. The actors were a handful of the more attractive and
intelligent children of the place. They had been trained under the
watchful eye of a priest who confessed to some notions of
stage-craft and delighted in juvenile theatricals. It was a
thrillingly realistic performance; the costumes&mdash;designed,
long ago, by the Good Duke himself&mdash;varied with every tableau.
Vociferous expressions of approval accompanied the performance. The
Saint's encounter in the grove of Alephane with the golden-haired
lady was a masterpiece of histrionic art; so was his solemn
preaching among the black natives. Tears flowed freely at his
violent death&mdash;a scene which was only marred by the erratic
movements of his venerable beard; that mill-stone, too, of
<i>papier mch</i>, played lovely pranks upon a pea-green ocean.
Best of all was the cannibalistic feast of the Crotalophoboi ending
with a tempestuous, demoniacal war-dance. Their blackened limbs
emerging from the scantiest of vesture, the actors surpassed
themselves. Such an uproar of applause accompanied the orgy that it
had to be repeated.</p>

<p>Every year it had to be repeated, this particular tableau. It
was by far the most popular, to the intense regret of the
<i>parroco</i>, the parish priest, a rigid disciplinarian, an alien
to Nepenthe, a frost-bitten soul from the Central Provinces of the
mainland. He used to complain that times were changed; that what
was good in the days of the Duke might not be good for the present
generation; that a scene such as this was no incentive to true
religion; that the Holy Mother of God could hardly be edified by
the performance, seeing that the players were almost nude, and that
certain of the gestures verged on indelicacy and even immodesty.
Every year he complained in like fashion: Ah, what would the
Madonna say, if she saw it?</p>

<p>And every year the entire body of the local clergy, with Don
Francesco as their eloquent spokesman, opposed his views.</p>

<p>The play was tradition, they avowed. Tradition must be upheld.
And what more? It savoured of heresy to suggest that the Mother of
God was blind to anything that happened on earth. Doubtless She saw
this particular scene; doubtless She approved; doubtless She
smiled, like everyone else. She loved her people in true motherly
fashion. She was not born in the Central Provinces. She was fond of
children, whether they wore clothes or not. The players enjoyed
themselves. So did the audience. The Mother of God liked them to
make a cheerful show in honour of that good old man, the Patron
Saint. And Saint Dodekanus himself&mdash;what would he think, if
this ancient act of homage were withheld? He would be very angry.
He would send an earthquake, or a visitation of the cholera, or a
shower of ashes from the volcano across the water. Piety and
prudence alike counselled them to keep in his good graces. And what
more? The performance had been established by the Good Duke; and
that endless line of godly bishops, succeeding each other since his
day, would never have given their sanction to the costumes and the
acting had they not known that the Madonna approved of them. Why
should She now think differently? The Mother of God was not a
fickle earthly creature, to change Her mind from one day to the
next.</p>

<p>With arguments such as these they endeavoured to controvert the
<i>parroco</i> who, being a fighter to the death, a resourceful
ascetic of unbending will, never admitted defeat. He bethought him
of other shifts. On one celebrated occasion he actually induced the
bishop&mdash;tired as the old prelate was, after his morning's ride
on the white donkey&mdash;to attend the performance, hoping to
obtain from him some confirmation of his own view, that the
objectionable scene should be entirely remodelled or, better still,
cut out altogether. The reverend dignitary was supposed to be
extremely short-sighted and wandering, moreover, in his mind, from
sheer decrepitude. Perhaps he was wily beyond the common measure of
man. Be that as it may, he witnessed the spectacle but allowed
nothing to escape his lips safe a succession of soft purring sound
resembling:</p>

<p>Gu-gu-gu-gu-gu-gu-gu-gu-gu-,</p>

<p>An ambiguous utterance, which was construed by both parties as a
verdict in their favour.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, while conceding that the acting was good&mdash;first
rate, in fact&mdash;could not make up his mind whether to be
shocked or pleased. He wondered whether such a play had any
features in common with religion. His host, who stood for paganism
and nudity and laughter, convinced him that it had.</p>

<p>"You would have seen the same thing in pre-Puritan England," he
concluded, at the end of a long exposition. "And now, if you like,
we will have a look at that Club. It may amuse you. There is still
time for the Duchess."</p>

</p>

<p>"This is the place," said Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>It was one of a row of tawdry modern buildings, the lower floors
of which were utilized as shops&mdash;an undistinguished sort of
place, in an undistinguished street. They climbed upstairs and
wandered through two or three rooms, all alike save that one of
them had a balcony; square, white-washed rooms, not very clean, and
inadequately furnished with tables, cane-bottomed chairs and a few
prints on the walls. There was a lavish display, however, of
bottles and glasses, and several shelves were littered with
newspapers in different languages. Acetylene lamps hung from the
flat ceiling. An odour of stale tobacco and alcohol pervaded the
premises. Flies were buzzing against the window-panes.</p>

<p>Half a dozen nondescript members, looking considerably the worse
for wear, loafed about moodily or snored in deck chairs. Two or
three were writing letters. It was the sulkiest hour of the day.
Mr. Heard noticed a slender young Indian and a blond-haired
fellow&mdash;probably a Scandinavian. They were arguing about
cigars with a rosy-cheeked old reprobate whom they called Charlie.
An adjoining apartment, the card-room, contained a livelier party,
among whom the bishop recognized Mr. Muhlen. He had lost no time in
making himself popular. He must have found congenial spirits
here.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Keith.</p>

<p>"Cheap and nasty," suggested the other.</p>

<p>"That's it! They call it the Alpha and Omega Club, to shadow
forth its all-embracing international character; it's just a
boozing institution, where you run to seed. They come in here, and
say the south wind makes them thirsty. Red and Blue Club would be a
more appropriate name. That is the whisky they have to drink."</p>

<p>"Why cannot they drink wine or&mdash;or ginger beer?"</p>

<p>"He tries to stop that. He would not be able to make any profits
on wine."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The President."</p>

<p>And Mr. Keith proceeded to sketch the history of the
establishment.</p>

<p>The Alpha and Omega Club had led a precarious existence. Often
its life dangled by a thread for lack of members, or because those
members who owed subscriptions were unable or unwilling to pay
them. Such had been the case before the accession of the new
President. It hung its drooping head; had almost withered away. Mr.
Freddy Parker tended the languid flower, and watered it&mdash;with
whisky of his own composition.</p>

<p>It revived. Or rather (which amounts to the same thing) Mr.
Parker revived&mdash;sufficiently, at all events, to pay off some
of the more pressing of his private debts. Napoleon, or somebody,
once remarked: "<i>L'tat, c'est moi</i>." Mr. Parker thought
highly of a strong character like Napoleon. He used to say, when
talking things over with his lady in her "boudoir" at the
Residency:</p>

<p>"The Club, that's me."</p>

<p>Declaring that wine was the ruin of the place, he
imported&mdash;it was the lady's idea, originally&mdash;the
far-famed "Red-and-Blue" brand of whisky in barrels. The liquid was
bottled in the cellars of the Residency. What happened during that
process was never revealed. It was affirmed, none the less, that
one barrel of the original stuff was more than enough for three
barrelfuls of the bottled product. Cultured members, on drinking
it, were wont to say things about Locusta and Borgia. The commoner
sort swore like hell at Freddy Parker. It made you feel squiffy
after the sixth glass&mdash;argumentative, magisterial, maudlin,
taciturn, erotic, sentimental, sea-sick, ecstatic, paralysed,
lachrymose, hilarious, pugilistic&mdash;according to your
temperament. Whatever your temperament it gave you a thundering
head next morning, and a throat like Nebuchadnezzar's fiery
furnace. It was known as "Parker's poison."</p>

<p>The stuff was served, at an alluring price, out of bottles
adorned with a seductive label&mdash;a label which had been
designed by an impecunious artist who, after running up a rousing
bill for drinks, got off payment on the strength of this job. But
the prettiest label in the world could not atone for the mixture
within. Members often complained of feeling queer. They threatened
to resign. Mr. Parker did not want them to resign; he wanted their
subscriptions. He had a grand way with him on such occasions.
Whenever one of them complained too bitterly or too
persistently&mdash;became damned abusive, in fact&mdash;he would
patiently wait and see which was the fellow's favourite newspaper.
That point settled&mdash;it was his lady's idea,
originally&mdash;he would stop the supply of the journal in
question, alleging insufficiency of Club revenues. These
Napoleon-like tactics generally brought the offending member to his
senses.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Parker spent a good deal of his time in
endeavouring to mask, under a cloak of boisterous good humour, a
really remarkable combination of malevolence and imbecility. He was
what you call a remittance man. He got so much a quarter&mdash;a
miserable sum it was&mdash;to keep out of England. He travelled
about formerly. But no amount of travel, no association with his
betters, could pierce his stolid pachydermatous obliquity. He was
the worst kind of Englishman; he could not even cheat without being
found out. But for the wise counsels of his lady he would have been
in the lock-up over and over again. Such being the case, he took a
justifiable pride in his Anglo-Saxon origin. Whenever a project
seemed too risky&mdash;not worth while, he called it&mdash;he would
say:</p>

<p>"It can't be done. That's a job for a Dago. I'm an Englishman,
you know."</p>

<p>He had knocked about the world a good bit, had Mr. Parker. His
last known domicile was Nicaragua. There he invested in some land
affair&mdash;a most unfortunate speculation, as it turned out. All
his speculation had a way of turning badly. That was because
people, even people in Nicaragua, distrusted him for one reason or
another; they said his whole existence was a tangle of shady and
ignoble transactions&mdash;that he looked like a fraud, and behaved
like one. He couldn't help his face; but his face, they soon
discovered, was not the only, or even the most, evasive and
fugitive part of his personality.</p>

<p>At last Nicaragua, even Nicaragua, got too hot for him.</p>

<p>There was Don Pomponio di Vergara y Puyarola, Nicaraguan
Minister of Finance; one might come to terms with a man of that
kind. It was arranged between them that His Excellency, who had a
large family and many poor dependents, should take over Mr.
Parker's landed interests; being a native of the place he might
succeed in squeezing a little something out of them. In exchange
for this concession an unobtrusive Government job was specially
created for Mr. Parker. He was appointed Financial Commissioner for
South-Eastern Europe, to reside at Nepenthe or wherever else he
pleased&mdash;unpaid; the exalted social status conferred by such a
post being deemed ample compensation. His sole duty consisted of
submitting a short annual report, a pure formality, to his
Government.</p>

<p>He departed, but not alone. With him went his familiar spirit,
his guardian angel, his lady, his step-sister&mdash;a dusky dame of
barn-like proportions. Arrived at Nepenthe they rented a small
villa, rather out of the way, which they called the Residency. The
change of climate did them good. So did the appointment. He was now
a person of consequence&mdash;the sole representative of a Foreign
Power on the island. His official rank procured him not only
dignity and a new start in life but, what was still more urgent,
credit. It brought him into contact with the local
authorities&mdash;with the red-haired rachitic judge, for instance,
between whom and Mr. Parker there sprang up an intimacy which was
viewed with vague forebodings. The lady, being a Catholic&mdash;Mr.
Parker, too, was suspected of Roman proclivities&mdash;was
confessed by the parish priest. That was a point gained; the
<i>parroco</i> being above suspicion, among foreigners at least.
She stayed mostly indoors, inventing scandals about people and
writing voluminous letters to warn new-comers of the appalling
immorality of the place.</p>

<p>To outward appearance the Commissioner and his lady agreed like
a brace of turtle-doves. He, too, was a moral and social reformer.
But men must live. The refined social status attached to Mr.
Parker's honorary post producing nothing tangible in the way of
ready cash, he began to cast about for some means of livelihood.
They wre getting into debt once more. Something must be done, he
declared.</p>

<p>His portly presence, flushed countenance, briar pipe,
knickerbockers and white spats had already become a familiar object
in the streets of the town, when a terrible uproar at the
Club&mdash;one of those periodical, approximately monthly, rows at
which the police, who hated meddling with foreigners, were
reluctantly compelled to intervene&mdash;suggested to her that
something might be done in that direction. She got him elected
President for that year, President for the next, the next, and the
next; in spite of the fact that, according to the rules, a new
President had to be elected every year. Who cared about rules? He
was the Commissioner! People were only too glad to have him there.
In fact, like Napoleon, he became a sort of Dictator.</p>

<p>He was now in his element. There were emoluments to be picked up
here&mdash;percentages, perquisites, and profits of all kinds. He
made a little arrangement with the Club laundry-woman to take in
his own washing as well, gratis. Under the threat of placing the
Club custom elsewhere he concluded a number of treaties, each
containing a secret clause which referred to fifteen per cent
profit for himself, with the grocer who supplied provisions; and
with other tradespeople dealing in stationery, soap, crockery
(broken crockery was a heavy item in the accounts) and
such&mdash;like Club necessaries. Next, he took the landlord in
hand. He would clear out, by God, and take more respectable
premises if the rent were not reduced by twenty per cent!
Scandalous! Downright robbery! The landlord being a reasonable sort
of man, it was agreed that the old rate should stand in the
contract, while the balance of twenty per cent found its way into
Mr. Parker's pockets, and not, as theretofore, into his own. The
same with the servants. From the boy who cleaned the rooms, and
whom he changed as often as ever possible, he exacted a monetary
deposit as a guarantee of good conduct&mdash;a deposit which was
never returned, whatever his behaviour had been. Then&mdash;the
subscriptions. For of course the accounts were never audited;
nobody bothered about such things on Nepenthe, with all that south
wind hanging about. If they had been he would have squared the
auditor up to any sum&mdash;a hundred francs, almost; it was worth
while. Pickings, he called them. The place, the system suited him
down to the ground. He had lived all his life on pickings. He was a
retail welsher; he lacked the nerve for sweeping enterprises.</p>

<p>On his accession, the Club was in such a state of
demoralization, had become such a public scandal, that Mr. Parker,
in his capacity of moralist, would have been the first person to
dissolve that assembly of topers and rakes. As financier, he meant
to live by it. But how was the place to be purified?</p>

<p>Parker's poison solved that problem, besides yielding a fine
slice of additional revenue. The hardest drinkers, the inveterate
rowdies, refused to believe that it was anything but the ordinary
whisky to which they had been accustomed from childhood; or
believing, refused out of sheer boastfulness, or force of habit, to
reduce their doses. While the moderate realized the truth and acted
accordingly, these others insisted upon regarding it as genuine
Scotch&mdash;with inevitable and dire results. They succumbed.
During the first year of Freddy Parker's reign, eight of these
stubborn sinners were carried to their graves. And year by year,
the same causes being in action, the process of betterment went on.
Extremists dropped off, moderates survived. The Club was purged of
its grosser elements, the moral tone of the establishment was
raised, through the operation of Parker's poison. It was Napoleon's
way with the Paris Parliament, he once explained to his lady, who
wondered vaguely how long the hero himself would have outlived the
effects of that mixture which she brewed, with her own fair hands,
in the dim vaults of the Residency.</p>

<p>Even now it was a pretty tough place. New crooks, like the
dubious Mr. Hopkins, new fire-eaters, new cranks, new sots, were
always dropping in from different corners of the globe to spread
their infection among the more recent crowd of curio-hunters,
gentlemen of commerce, nautical wrecks, decayed missionaries,
painters, authors and other vagrant riff-raff who frequented the
premises. There were rows going on all the time&mdash;insignificant
rows, mostly about newspapers and gambling debts. Mr. Samuel got
his eye blacked over a harmless game of ecarte; Mr. White, one of
the steadiest members, threatened to withdraw his subscription on
account of the black-beetles; a Swedish sea-captain smashed nine
panes of glass&mdash;just by way of a friendly demonstration, he
said&mdash;because the great Upsala journal, the <i>Utan
Stafvel</i>, was missing from its shelf; a muscular Japanese made
himself distinctly offensive about the <i>Nichi-nichi-shin-bum</i>
being out of date, and was going to twist everybody's head off, if
it occurred again; the excellent Vice-President, Mr. Richards,
tumbled noisily downstairs, nobody knew how or why&mdash;all on a
single afternoon. The sirocco happened to be particularly trying
that day.</p>

<p>On the whole, there was no denying the fact that the Club
flourished under the statesman-like autocracy of Mr. Parker. That
was partly because, unlike previous presidents, he was generally on
the spot. Some great man once made a remark about the need of "the
Master's Eye." He believed in that remark. If you run a place, run
it yourself. He was ever-present, absorbing at other people's
expense his own poison, to the effects of which he seemed to be
immune; and borrowing money, on the sly, from the richer and more
forgetful members. His uproarious joviality, his echoing ha! ha!
became a feature of the place; it deceived the simple, and amused
the complex. He was ready to talk about anything with anybody who
shoved along; he had a fund of naughty tropical stories for the
so-called bawdy section, and could be as sympathetic and pious as
you please with a contrite youngster suffering from last night's
debauch.</p>

<p>"A hair of the dog," he would suggest with a genial wink,
pushing the bottle temptingly nearer.</p>

<p>The regulations had also been improved under his auspices. The
entrance fee was imperceptibly raised, while the conditions of
entry were relaxed. It was his lady's idea originally. She made it
clear that the more numerous the members the greater the quantity
of whisky consumed&mdash;the greater, therefore, their profits;
quite apart from the possibility of additional subscriptions being
paid. He agreed. Then, in a sudden glow of commercial enthusiasm,
he proceeded to hint that ladies should also be admitted.
Regretfully she put her foot down. Anywhere else the proposal would
have been welcome. It was out of the question on Nepenthe.</p>

<p>"You're forgetting that Wilberforce woman," she said. "She would
have to be carried home every night. It couldn't be done, Freddy.
We might as well shut up the shop at once. People would get talking
about the place&mdash;you know how they talk, as it is."</p>

<p>Miss Wilberforce was a pathetic local figure, a lady by birth,
with a ready tongue, wiry limbs, and an insatiable craving for
alcohol. She would unavoidably have damaged the reputation of the
place, to say nothing of its furniture. She had gone from bad to
worse lately.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right, Lola. It isn't worth while for those few
subscriptions. After all, I'm an Englishman. But how about all
those Russians?" he added.</p>

<p>"I've often told you to let them in, Freddy."</p>

<p>"So you have, dear! It was your idea originally. Well, I must
think it over again."</p>

<p>He thought it over and regretfully came to the conclusion that
it could not be done. Russians were not people of the right kind.
They were not honest.</p>

<p>"Russians are too artistic to be honest," he declared.</p>

<p>It was a <i>bon mot</i> which he had picked up, long ago, from
Madame Steynlin, in the days when the lady looked with disfavour on
the Muscovite colony. That Lutheran period was over for the
present: she was orthodox so far as sentiments were concerned.
Nothing could be good enough for the Russians, just then. An
acquaintance with Peter, one of the handsomest of the whole batch
of religious enthusiasts, had brought about her psychological
conversion and altered her outlook upon life. Her heart was in the
Urals. But that stupid, malicious epigram had impressed itself on
the mind of Mr. Parker, who was hopelessly insensitive to the
flaxen curls of Peter.</p>

<p>"No," he decided. "They are not honest. We must draw the line
somewhere, Lola. I draw it at Russians. At least I think we ought
to. But I'll think it over again."</p>

<p>That was foolish of him, she opined. For the Muscovites would
probably have paid their accounts as regularly as other members;
and as to their capacity for raising the Club revenues by the
destruction of alcohol&mdash;why, many people had said unkind
things about them, and yet nobody had gone so far as to accuse them
of being unable to stow it away in proper Christian style. No
wonder. Because there was nothing whatever in their Bible, the
<i>Golden Book</i> of the divinely inspired Bazhakuloff, to
prohibit or even limit the consumption of strong waters. In the
matter of dietary he had only bidden them refrain from the flesh of
warm-blooded beasts.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker was always thinking things over and coming to the
wrong conclusion. It was foolish of him.</p>

<p>She knew him too well to say anything more for the moment. She
would have to bide her time because Freddy, of whom she had made an
exhaustive study, was a wobbler, and worse than a wobbler. He was
stubborn at the wrong season and difficult to manage. He needed
careful motherly guidance. All fools, she reflected, were subject
to meteoric gleams of common sense. He was no exception to that
rule. But whereas they received such flashes with thankfulness, he
persisted in regarding them as inspirations of the devil. That was
the tragedy of Freddy Parker. It made him into something
quinessential&mdash;a kind of super-fool...</p>

<p>Mr. Keith enquired:</p>

<p>"You don't want to become a member of this institution, do you,
Bishop?"</p>

<p>The other pondered awhile.</p>

<p>"I am pretty democratic," he replied. "We have some warm places
in Africa, you know, and I never allowed myself to be beaten by
them. Perhaps I might be of use to some of those poor fellows in
there. But I like to do things properly. It would entail at first a
little friendly drinking, I'm afraid, in order to gain their
confidence. It is not in my character to do one thing and preach
another. I cannot pose as an abstainer after the way I enjoyed your
luncheon. But the smell of the whisky here&mdash;it scares me. My
liver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said Mr. Keith with a sigh. "No wonder you hesitate.
It is quite disheartening, all that drunkenness."</p>

</p>

<p>It stands to reason that the Duchess was not a Duchess at all.
She was American by birth, from some Western state, and her first
husband had been an army man. Her second spouse&mdash;he, too, had
died long ago&mdash;was Italian. In view of his passionate devotion
to the Catholic Church and of a further payment of fifty thousand
francs, he had been raised to the rank of Papal Marquis. He died
relatively young. Had his life been spared, as it ought to have
been, he might well have become a Papal Duke in course of time. He
was carried off by an accident not of his own contriving&mdash;run
over by a tramcar in Rome&mdash;before that further ducal premium
was even expected to be paid. But for this, he ought to have died a
Duke. He would have been a Duke, by this time.</p>

<p>His widow, taking these things into consideration, felt it her
duty to appropriate the more sonorous of the two titles open to
her. Nobody contested her claim. All her friends, on the contrary,
declared that she talked like a peeress and behaved like one; and
in a world where the few remaining authentic specimens of that
class fail to fulfil either the one or the other of these
conditions, it was thought meet and proper that somebody should be
good enough to carry on, if only in semblance, and if only in
Nepenthe, the traditions of a race rapidly approaching extinction.
It was pleasant to be able to converse with a Duchess at any hour
of the day, and this one was nothing if not accessible so long as
you were fairly well clothed, had a reasonably supply of small talk
and did not profess violent anti-papal sentiments.</p>

<p>Some people said she dressed like a Duchess, but there was less
unanimity on this point. Her handsome oval face and towering grey
hair induced her to cultivate an antique pose, with a view to
resembling "La Pompadour." La Pompadour stood for something courtly
and powdered. She certainly dressed better and on far less money
than Madame Steynlin, whose plump figure, round sunburnt cheeks,
and impulsive manner would never have done for an old-world beauty,
and who cared little what frocks she wore, so long as somebody
loved her. The Duchess had all the aplomb of La Pompadour, but not
much of her French accent. Her Italian, too, was somewhat
embryonic. That mattered little. The external impression, the grand
manner, was everything. She was not lame, though she generally
leaned on somebody's arm or a stick. It was rather a pretty stick.
She would have worm a pomander in her hair, or on a chatelaine, if
anybody had told her what a pomander was. As her friends were
unable to enlighten her&mdash;Mr. Keith even hinting that it was an
object which could not be mentioned in polite society&mdash;she
contented herself with a couple of patches.</p>

<p>Her rooms in that disused convent were an interminable suite of
rectangular chambers, unpretentious but solidly built, with
straight corridors running alongside. You beheld pretty pavements
of old-fashioned tiles, not overmuch furniture, one or two
portraits of the Pope, and abundance of flowers and crucifixes. The
Duchess specialized in flowers and crucifixes. Everybody, aware of
her fondness for them, gave her either the one or the other, or
both. An elaborate arrangement for tea occupied one of the rooms;
there was also a cold buffet for gentlemen&mdash;brandies and wines
and iced soda-water and lobster sandwiches and suchlike.</p>

<p>A many-tongued conversation filled the air with pleasant
murmurs. Various nationalities were represented, though the Russian
colony was conspicuous by its absence. The Duchess, like Mr. Freddy
Parker, drew the line at Russians. If only they would not dress so
oddly, with those open collars, leathern belts, and scarlet
blouses! The judge, also, was never asked to come&mdash;he was too
outspoken a freethinker, and too fond of spitting on the floor. Nor
did Mr. Eames put in an appearance. He avoided social obligations;
his limited means preventing him from making any adequate return.
But there was an ample display of ecclesiastics, together with a
few other notabilities. Mr. Heard encountered some familiar faces,
and made new friends. He felt drawn towards Madame
Steynlin&mdash;she had such a cheerful bright face.</p>

<p>"And how delightfully cool these rooms are!" he was saying to
the Duchess. "I wonder how you manage to keep the sirocco out?"</p>

<p>"By closing the windows, Bishop. English people will not believe
that. They open their windows. In comes the heat."</p>

<p>"If English people closed their windows they would die," said
Don Francesco. "Half the houses in England would be condemned by
law in this country and pulled down, on account of their low
ceilings. Low ceilings have given the Englishman his cult of fresh
air. He likes to be cosy and familiar and exclusive; he has no
sense for broad social functions. There is something of the
cave-dweller in every Englishman. He may say what he likes, but the
humble cottage will always remain his dream. You can tell the
ideals of a nation by its advertisements. This country is pastoral.
That is why our advertisements are so apt to portray commercial
conditions&mdash;enormous factories and engines and chimneys; we
are dissatisfied with our agricultural state. The Frenchman's
aspiration is woman; Paris hoardings will tell you that. England is
a land of industrial troglodytes, where every man's cavern is his
castle. Its advertisements depict either gross masses of food such
as cave-dwellers naturally relish, or else quiet country
scenes&mdash;green lanes, and sunsets, and peaceful dwellings in
the country. Home, sweet home! The cottage! That means open windows
or suffocation... I think I see the person who spoke to you on the
steamer," he added to Mr. Heard. "I don't like his looks. He is
coming our way."</p>

<p>"That must be Mr. Muhlen," exclaimed the Duchess. "They say he
played beautifully at the hotel last night. I wonder whether I
could induce him to try my Longwood? It's rather an old model, I
fear, and out of tune."</p>

<p>The gentleman appeared, ostentatiously dressed and escorted by
Mr. Richards, the Vice-President of the Alpha and Omega Club, who
seemed to be fairly steady on his legs and was presently absorbed
in an artistic examination of a number of silver ornaments,
crucifixes, relics and suchlike objects of virtu, which the Duchess
had gathered together. He handled them like a connoisseur. Others
of that institution had promised to attend the party but, on being
overhauled by the conscientious Vice-President, were found to be
unpresentable at the last moment.</p>

<p>The Duchess moved away to greet him. Mr. Heard remarked to Don
Francesco:</p>

<p>"That middle-aged colleague of yours, yonder&mdash;he has an
unusual face."</p>

<p>"Our parish priest. A sound Christian!"</p>

<p>The <i>parroco's</i> thin lips, peaked nose, beady eyes and
colourless cheeks proclaimed the anchorite, if not the monomaniac.
He flitted about like a draught of cold air, refusing all
refreshments and not daring to smell the flowers, lest he should
derive too much pleasure from them. He was often called Torquemada,
from his harsh and abstemious habits. The name had been given him,
of course, by his brother priests who knew about such matters, and
not by the common people to whom the word Torquemada would have
suggested, if anything, a savoury kind of pudding. Torquemada was
capable of any sacrifice, of any enormity, in defence of the faith.
A narrow medieval type, he was the only person on Nepenthe who
would have been hewn in pieces for his God&mdash;nobody allowing
themselves to be even temporarily incommoded in so visionary a
cause. He enjoyed a reputation of perfect chastity which
differentiated him from all the remaining priests and contributed,
more than anything else, to his unpopularity. It enraged the
frankly carnal natives to such an extent that they made
insinuations about his bodily health and told other horrible
stories, swore they were true, and offered to give statistical
figures in confirmation. They said, among other things, that after
begging money from wealthy foreigners for alleged repairs to the
parish organ and other godly purposes, he kept the proceeds himself
on the principle that charity began at home and ought to end there.
Nobody could deny his devotion to mother, sisters, and even distant
relatives. So much was also certain, that the <i>parroco's</i>
family was poor.</p>

<p>Harp-like tinklings arose from an adjoining chamber; a general
move took place in that direction. Mr. Keith was there. He sat
beside Madame Steynlin who, being a fair performer herself, was
listening with rapture to Muhlen's strains. During a pause he
said:</p>

<p>"I wish I could make it out. It annoys me, Madame Steynlin, not
to comprehend the charm of music. I would give almost anything to
the person who can satisfy me that what I hear is not a succession
of unnecessary noises."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are not musical."</p>

<p>"That would not prevent my understanding the feelings of people
like yourself. I don't want to be musical. I want to get a grip of
this thing. I want to know. Tell me why you like it and why I
don't. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sounds began again.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Duchess, "that wonderful <i>andante con
brio</i>!"</p>

<p>Then, as the strains grew louder, she whispered to Don Francesco
upon a subject which had always puzzled her.</p>

<p>"I would be glad to learn," she said, "why our parliamentary
representative, Commendatore Morena, has never yet visited
Nepenthe. Surely it is his duty to show himself now and then to his
parishioners&mdash;constituents, I mean? This festival of Saint
Dodekanus would have been such a good opportunity. His appearance
would have been a discomfiture for the free-thinkers. Every year he
promises to come. And every year he fails us. Why?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," replied the priest. "The animal has probably
got other things to do."</p>

<p>"The animal? Ah, don't say that! And such a good Catholic!"</p>

<p>"Foreigners, dear Duchess, I leave to your judgment. They are of
little account, anyhow. But you will be guided by me in your
appreciation of the worldly qualities of natives. Otherwise, with
all your intelligence, it will be impossible for you to avoid
mistakes. Let us leave it at that."</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will leave it at that, dear lady!"</p>

<p>"Indeed we will, Don Francesco," replied the Duchess, who loved
to be ruled in matters of this kind.</p>

<p>At this moment, the performer rose from the piano with
unexpected suddenness remarking <i>sotto voce</i> that if he had
known he was to play on a spinet he would have brought some Lulli
with him. He was beaming all over, none the less, and soon making
arrangements with other guests for a series of picnics and boating
excursions&mdash;getting on swimmingly, in fact, when the
thoughtless Madame Steynlin captured him and began to talk music.
He repeated that remark, too good to be lost, about the spinet; it
led to Scarlatti, Mozart, Handel. He said Handel was the saviour of
English music. She said Handel was its blight and damnation. Each
being furnished with copious arguments, the discussion degenerated
into technicalities.</p>

<p>Denis, meanwhile, was handing round tea-cakes and things, with
the double object of making himself useful and of being as near as
possible to Angelina, the hand-maiden of the Duchess, a
bewitchingly pretty brunette, who was doing the same. Perhaps the
existence of Angelin accounted for his respectful attentions and
frequent visits to the Duchess. He felt he was really in love for
the first time in his life.</p>

<p>He worshipped from afar. He would have liked to worship from a
little nearer, but did not know how to set about it; he was afraid
of troubling what he called her innocence. Hitherto he had scored
no great success. Angelina, aged fifteen, with the figure of a
fairy, a glowing complexion, and a rich southern voice, was
perfectly aware of his idealistic sentiments. She responded to the
extent of gazing at him, now and then, in a most disconcerting
fashion. It was as though she cared little about idealism. She did
not smile. There was neither love nor disdain in that gaze; it was
neither hot nor cold, nor yet lukewarm; it was something else,
something he did not want at all&mdash;something that made him feel
childish and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And another pair of eyes were watching all the time, her sinuous
movements&mdash;those of Mr. Edgar Marten. This young scientist,
too, cherished loving thoughts about Angelina, thoughts of a more
earthly and volcanic tinge; certain definite projects which made
him forget, at times, his preoccupation with biotite, perlite,
magnetite, anorthite, and pyroxene.</p>

<p>"Denis," said Keith, in his usual pompous fashion. "Do put down
that absurd tray and let people help themselves. Listen to me for a
moment. How do you like this place? I am not asking out of vulgar
curiosity; I am anxious to know the impressions of a person of your
age and antecedents. You might collect them for me, will you? Not
now. One day when you are in the mood. Somewhat terrestrial and
palpitating, is it not, after the cloistered twilight of a
University?"</p>

<p>"I came here from Florence," observed Denis.</p>

<p>"And even after Florence! Do you know why? Because mankind
dominates in Tuscany. The land is encrusted with ephemeral human
conceits. That is not altogether good for a youngster; it
disarranges his mind and puts him out of harmony with what is
permanent. Just listen a moment. Here, if you are wise, you will
seek an antidote. Taken in over-doze, all these churches and
pictures and books and other products of our species are toxins for
a boy like you. They falsify your cosmic values. Try to be more of
an animal. Try to extract pleasure from more obvious sources. Lie
fallow for a while. Forget all these things. Go out into the midday
glare. Sit among rocks and by the sea. Have a look at the sun and
stars for a change; they are just as impressive as Donatello. Find
yourself! You know the Cave of Mercury? Climb down, one night of
full moon, all alone, and rest at its entrance. Familiarize
yourself with elemental things. The whole earth reeks of humanity
and its works. One has to be old and tough to appraise them at
their true worth. Tell people to go to Hell, Denis, with their
altar-pieces and museums and clock-towers and funny little
art-galleries."</p>

<p>Everybody is always giving me advice, thought Denis. And the
worst of it is, it's often sound.</p>

<p>A melodious voice added:</p>

<p>"If, after that lecture, you still have some crotchety
appreciation left for the works of man, you may be interested, when
next you visit the Old Town, to look at some busts and other
curiosities of mine. There is a little Greek bronze I would like to
show you, though perhaps we had better not talk too openly about
it. Pray come. You will extract pleasure from that statuette. And I
will extract pleasure from your company. Obvious sources of
pleasure, aren't they, Keith?"</p>

<p>It was Count Caloveglia. He was referring to the Locri Faun, a
wonderful antique which had recently been found on his property
near the town of that name on the neighbouring mainland, and was
about to be secretly smuggled out of Italy. He smiled in winning
fashion as he spoke. Like everyone else, Denis had fallen under the
spell of this attractive and courteous old aristocrat who was
saturated to the very marrow in the lore of antiquity. There was
sunshine in his glance&mdash;a lustrous gem&mdash;like grace; one
realized from his conversation, from his every word, that he had
discarded superfluities of thought and browsed for a lifetime, in
leisurely fashion, upon all that purifies and exalts the spirit.
Nothing, one felt, would avail to ruffle that deep pagan
content.</p>

<p>"And how," he continued, addressing Denis, "are your Italian
studies progressing?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well, thank you. My French puts me out a little. And I
can't yet conjugate properly."</p>

<p>"That is certainly a drawback," said Don Francesco, appearing on
the scene. "But don't let it trouble you," he added in paternal
tones. "It will come in time. You are still young. You are learning
Russian, Madame Steynlin?"</p>

<p>"Only a few words." She blushed becomingly. "There are certain
sounds, like water being poured into a jug&mdash;neither easy nor
pleasant. I am not as quick as some people. Mrs. Meadows always
speaks Hindustani to her old Sicilian woman. She comprehends
perfectly."</p>

<p>"So clever these people are, at languages!" said the
Duchess.</p>

<p>Marten remarked:</p>

<p>"I don't bother to learn Italian. I talk Latin to them. They
understand all right."</p>

<p>"And what Latin, Marten!" laughed Denis. "No wonder they
understand. I'm coming to you on Thursday morning. Don't
forget."</p>

<p>"I have not had your public school advantages. But I manage to
get what I want out of them, generally speaking," and he cast a
fiery glance in the direction of Angelina, who returned it over her
shoulder, unabashed. Denis, fortunately, was looking the other
way.</p>

<p>"I wish I had enjoyed all your chances," observed the Duchess,
with a little mock-sigh. "We were so carelessly brought up. I
learnt practically nothing at school. It is a pity. Ah, Bishop! I
forgot to tell you. Such a charming note from your cousin. She
cannot come. The baby is teething and troublesome in this heat. You
will have to drive up, I'm afraid...Mr. Keith, I have not yet
thanked you for those flowers and the book you sent. The flowers
are quite too lovely. Look at them! You are spoiling me&mdash;you
really are! But I don't think I shall like the book. Lady Cecilia
and her maid and that man, I forget his name&mdash;they do all
sorts of things. They don't seem to be very nice people."</p>

<p>"You have nothing but nice people round you, Duchess. Why should
you want to read about them? There is so much goodness in real
life. Do let us keep it out of our books."</p>

<p>"That sounds a dreadful doctrine. I see the <i>parroco</i> is
about to take his departure. Why does everybody leave so soon?"</p>

<p>She wandered away.</p>

<p>"The English are supposed to be bad linguists," said Don
Francesco. "It is one of those curious international fallacies,
like saying the French are a polite nation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or that home-made marmalade tastes better than the stuff you
buy in shops," added Denis. "I must help the Duchess to say
good-bye to those people. She likes to have some one handy on such
occasions. She needs an echo. I am becoming quite a good echo."</p>

<p>"You are," said Keith, rather sharply. "Quite a pretty echo. And
you ought to be a voice. Follow my prescription, Denis. The Cave of
Mercury."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c08.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>Count Caloveglia remarked:</p>

<p>"What a pity that Latin, as scholars' language, for the
definition and registration of ideas, was ever abandoned! It has
the incalculable advantage that the meanings of words are
irrevocably fixed by authority. New ones could be coined as
occasion required. Knowledge would gain by leaps and bounds. There
would be a cross-fertilization of cultures. As things now stand,
half the intellectuals of this world are writing about matters
which, unbeknown to themselves, have already been treated by the
other half. One would think that Commerce, which has broken down
geographical barriers, might have done the same to political ones.
Far from it! In sharpening men's lust for gold, it has demarcated
our frontiers with a bitterness hitherto unknown. The world of
thought has not expanded; it has contracted and grown provincial.
Men have lost sight of distant horizons. Nobody writes for
humanity, for civilization; they write for their country, their
sect; to amuse their friends or annoy their enemies. Pliny or
Linneus or Humboldt&mdash;they sat on mountain-tops; they surveyed
the landscape at their feet, and if some little valley lay shrouded
in mist, the main outlines of the land yet lay clearly distended
before them. You will say that it is impossible, nowadays, to
gather up the threads of learning as did these men; they are too
multifarious, too divergent. A greater mistake could not be
imagined. For there is a contrary tendency at work&mdash;a tendency
towards unification. The threads converge. Medieval minds knew many
truths, hostile to one another. All truths are now seen to be
interdependent; never was synthesis easier of attainment. Conflict
of nationality and language hinders the movement. Mankind at large
is the loser. The adoption of a universal scholars' tongue would do
much to remove the obstacle. When these Southern races coalesce to
form the great alliance which I foresee, when the Mediterranean
basin is once more the centre of human activity as it deserves to
be, some such plan will doubtless be adopted."</p>

<p>"Your notion would suit me down to the ground," said the bishop,
who was a good Latinist. "I would love to converse in the old style
with a student from Salamanca or Bergen or Khieff or Padua
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Don Francesco gave utterance to some wholly unintelligible
speech. Then he observed:</p>

<p>"The student might not be able to catch your meaning, Mr. Heard.
I was only talking Latin! You see, we would be obliged to
standardize our pronunciation. I wonder, by the way, why the old
scholars' language was ever discarded?"</p>

<p>"Patriotism destroyed it," replied the Count. "That narrow
modern patriotism of the cock-on-the-dung-hill type."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith began:</p>

<p>"It is an atavistic and altogether discreditable
phenomenon&mdash;this recent recrudescence of monarchical
principles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you promise about long words?" playfully enquired the
Duchess, who had just returned.</p>

<p>"I cannot help it, dear lady. It is my mother's fault. She was
so very precise. I was carefully brought up."</p>

<p>"That is a pity, Mr. Keith."</p>

<p>"Northern people are very precise," said Don Francesco, folding
his gown around his ample limbs. "Particularly in love affairs. We
down here, who live in this sirocco, are supposed to be calculating
and mercenary in matters of the heart. We want dowries for our
daughters&mdash;they say we are always coming to the point: money,
money! The capacity of an English girl for coming to the point will
take some beating. She paralyses you with directness. I will tell
you a true story. There was a young Italian whom I knew&mdash;yes,
I knew him well. He had just arrived in London; very handsome in
the face, though perhaps a little too fat. He fell in love with an
elegant young lady who was employed in the establishment of Madame
Elise in Bond Street. He used to wait for her to come out at six
o'clock and follow her like a dog, not daring to speak. He carried
a costly bracelet for her in his pocket, and every day fresh
flowers, which he was always too shy and too deeply enamoured to
present. She was his angel, his ideal. He dreamt of her by day and
night, wondering whether he would ever have the courage to address
so tall and queenly a creature. It was his first English love
affair, you understand; he learnt the proper technique later on.
For five or six weeks this unhappy state of things continued, till
one day, when he was running after her as usual, she turned round
furiously and said: 'What do you mean, sir, by following me about
it this disgusting fashion? How day you? I shall call the police,
if it occurs again.' He was deprived of speech at first: he could
only gaze in what you call dumb amazement. Then he managed to
stammer out something about his heart and his love, and to show her
the flowers and the bracelet. She said: 'So that's it, is it? Well
of all the funny boys. Why couldn't you speak up sooner? D'you know
of a place round here&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>It was a formidable explosion on the part of the Commissioner,
in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>He was talking to some friends about Napoleon.</p>

<p>They wanted a fellow like that on Nepenthe&mdash;a fellow who
got things done. Napoleon would have made no bones about the
Wilberforce woman over there. It was a scandalous state of affairs.
What was the use of a Committee for trying to keep her in order and
getting her locked up in a sanatorium? Everybody knew what a
Committee meant. Committee! It was a preposterous word. Committees
were the same all the world over. Committee! He was in charge of
that particular one; they were dong all they could, but what did it
amount to? Nothing. To begin with, there was not enough money
coming in, unless somebody could wheedle a cheque out of that rich
old Koppen sensualist whose yacht might be arriving at any moment.
And then her own pig-headedness! She refused to be talked over into
doing what was in her own interests. Napoleon, he reckoned, might
have talked her over&mdash;ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>The lady in question, all unaware of these humanitarian designs,
had taken up a strategic position in the neighbourhood of the
drinks, and was glancing shyly round the room in search of a likely
male who would fetch her a stiff glass of something from the
buffet, and that soon. She was groggy, but not sufficiently primed
to go there herself; she knew that everybody's eye would be fixed
upon her; she had been much talked about of late. Drunk, she was
impossible; dead sober, almost as bad&mdash;haughty, sullen,
logical, with a grieved and surprised air suggestive of wounded
dignity.</p>

<p>People avoided Miss Wilberforce. And yet you could not help
liking her in those rare moments when she was just a little
disguised. She had a pretty wit, then; a residue of gentle nurture;
tender instincts and a winsomeness of manner that captivated you.
Nor were appearances against her. That frail, arrowy figure was
invariably clothed in black. She wore the colour by instinct. They
said she had lost her sailor fiance who was drowned, poor lad, in
the Mediterranean; and that now she wandered about at night looking
for him, or trying to forget him and seeking oblivion in
tipple.</p>

<p>The story happened to be true, for a wonder. She had received a
twist for life. The death of this young lover gave to her
impressionable being a shock which never passed off again. The
world was turned inside out for Amy Wilberforce. She seldom spoke
of his fate. But she was always talking about the sea. She tried to
drown herself, once or twice. Then, gradually, she put on a new
character altogether and relapsed into queer ancestral traits,
stripping off, like so many worthless rags, the layers of
laboriously acquired civilization. The refined and bashful girl
became brusque, supercilious, equivocal. When sympathizing friends
said that they had also lost lovers, she laughed and told them to
look for new ones. There were better fish in the sea, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>Soon she found herself abandoned, in spite of a full banking
account. People had dropped her, right and left.</p>

<p class="caption">Miss Wilberforce and Denis</p>

<p>The years went by.</p>

<p>Calmly, without misgivings and without fervour, she took to the
bottle.</p>

<p>Something drew her to Nepenthe&mdash;dim Mediterranean memories.
Arrived there, she used to engulf three pints of Martell and
Hennessey, one after the other, and then "wash them out"&mdash;such
was her phraseology&mdash;with a magnum of Perrier Jouet; a
proceeding which, while it heightened her complexion and gave a
sparkle to her poor flustered eye, was not conducive to the
preservation of equilibrium in the lower limbs. There resulted
those periodical "nervous breakdowns" which necessitated seclusion
and sometimes medical treatment. The collapses had become
distressingly frequent with the last year or two. One of her many
drawbacks was that she courted publicity in her cups. She was
perfectly reckless as to what she then said, and had been known to
bring a blush to the seasoned cheek of Don Francesco himself who,
unaware of her condition at one particular moment, politely
ventured to enquire why she always wore black and was told that she
was in mourning, as everybody ought to mourn, for his lost
innocence. Being an Englishwoman, she was a thorn in the side of
her moral compatriot the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Her noctambulous habits often brought her into contact with the
local police and sometimes with His Worship Signor Malipizzo.
Greatly to the surprise of Mr. Parker, the magistrate was observed
to take a lenient view of the case. None the less, she had passed
several nights in the local gaol. Staggering about the lanes of
Nepenthe in the silent hours before dawn, she was liable to be
driven, at the bidding of some dark primeval impulse, to divest
herself of her raiment&mdash;a singularity which perturbed even the
hardiest of social night-birds who had the misfortune to encounter
her. Taxed with this freakish behaviour, she would refer to the
example of St. Francis of Assisi who did the same, and brazenly ask
whether he wasn't good enough for them? Whether she couldn't give
her last shirt to a beggar, as well as anybody else? In short,
there was nothing to be done with her.</p>

<p>The dear lady, as Keith often called her, was becoming a real
problem.</p>

<p>And now her eye, roving round the room, fixed itself with the
drunkard's divine unerring instinct upon Denis. What a nice,
modest, gentlemanly-looking boy! Just what she wanted.</p>

<p>"This sirocco!" she sighed, groping dramatically for a chair.
"It makes me feel so funny. Oh, dear! I shall go off in a faint.
Ah, do be a kind young man and fetch me some brandy and soda. A
large tumbler. Ah, do! And very little soda, please&mdash;on
account of my heart. Only the smallest drop!"</p>

<p>She took two or three sips, paused awhile as though undecided
whether she could possibly swallow such nasty stuff and then, with
a fine show of reluctance, gulped it all down. Denis was
spell-bound; the dose, he artlessly imagined, was enough to kill a
horse. Far from being damaged, Miss Wilberforce took a chair beside
him, and began to converse. Charmingly she talked; all about
England. As he listened he grew delighted, entranced. She was
different, somehow, from all the other ladies he had lately met on
the Continent. She was altogether different. Whence came it, he
wondered?</p>

<p>Then, as the discourse proceeded, he began to realize what was
the matter with them. It was odd, he thought, that he had not
noticed it before. Miss Wilberforce made him realize wherein the
difference lay. They spoke English, it was true; but they had all
taken on a Continental outlook; alien phrases, expressions,
affectations; cosmopolitan airs and graces that jarred on his
frank, untarnished English nature. This one was otherwise. She was
old England, through and through. The conversation cheered him to
an unusual degree&mdash;among all those foreign people he felt
strangely drawn towards this wistful lady who could talk so
naturally and conjure up, by the mere power of words, a breath of
his own homestead in the Midlands. He might have been sitting with
an elder sister just then, eating strawberries and cream and
watching a tennis match on some shady green lawn. He was happy;
happier still when Angelina once more floated into his ken and,
noticing Miss Wilberforce, raised her eyebrows mischievously and
gave him something that looked like a real smile, for a change.</p>

<p>She had another smile, however, for Mr. Edgar Marten; and yet
another one for Don Francesco who, as she passed near him, profited
by the occasion to give her a paternal semi-proprietary chuck under
the chin, accompanying the indecorous movement with an almost
audible wink.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard had noticed everything. He frowned at first. It gave
him a little twinge, and some food for thought. He was absurdly
sensitive about women.</p>

<p>"A frolicsome child," he mused. "<i>Lasciva puella</i>. Possibly
wanton."</p>

<p>What were this young man's relations with the girl? That contact
of hand and chin&mdash;what did it imply? Was the action
quasi-paternal, or pseudo-paternal? Regretfully he decided that it
was only pseudo-paternal.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;it was all so confoundedly natural!</p>

<p>"Nobody but our <i>parroco</i> could keep his hands off that
girl," blithely remarked the priest.</p>

<p>Another little twinge...</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c09.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was not prone to wax enthusiastic over the delights of
architecture or natural scenery. He called himself unexpansive and
unromantic; he confessed to small understanding, small veneration,
for artistic effects. The beauty of a man's character moved him
more strongly than the beauty of any picture or any landscape. Yet,
on arriving next afternoon at the upper plateau of Nepenthe he
could not help being struck by the strange and almost compelling
charm of the "Old Town." It was so different from the lower
regions&mdash;so calm and reposeful.</p>

<p>Down below, in that more accessible modern settlement,
everything was bright and many-tinted; there was movement and noise
and colour; a dazzling spot! The subtle influence of the sea,
though it lay four hundred feet lower down, was ever present; one
felt oneself on an island. On reaching these heights that feeling
evaporated. You were embowered in mighty trees, in the midst of
which stood the Old Town.</p>

<p>Unlike that other one, it faced due North; it lay, moreover, a
few hundred feet higher up. That alone could not have explained the
difference in temperature, one might say in climate, between the
two. To begin with, there was on this tiny upland basin
exceptionally deep soil, borne down by the rains of unnumbered
centuries from the heights overhead and enabling those shady oaks,
poplars, walnuts and apples to shoot up to uncommon size and
luxuriance and screen away the sunny beams. From above, meanwhile,
a perennial shower descended. The moisture-laden sirocco, tearing
itself to shreds against the riven summits of the high southern
cliffs, dripped ceaselessly upon this verdant oasis in clouds of
invisible dew. You could often enjoy the luxury of a shiver, at
night-time, in the Old Town.</p>

<p>It was a stronghold originally; built on these heights for the
greater security of the islanders against Saracenic inroads. When a
more peaceful era drew night the population began to decline; they
found it more convenient to establish themselves in the new
settlement lower down. Then came the Good Duke Alfred&mdash;that
potentate who, as Mr. Eames was wont to say, <i>nihil quod tetigit
non ornavit</i>. He took a fancy to this quaint old citadel which,
before his day, could only be reached b a rough mule-track easily
defended against invaders. After constructing a fine road of access
with many twists and turnings, wide enough to admit the passage of
two of his roomy state carriages driving abreast, he turned his
mind to other improvements. Professing to be an admirer of the good
old times, he decided to keep up its traditional character&mdash;it
was to remain a fortress, in appearance if not reality. A massive
crenellated rampart, furnished with four gateways and watch-towers
at convenient intervals but serving no purpose in particular, grew
up around the place; every one of its houses which failed to fit in
with the design of this battlemented structure&mdash;and there were
a good many of them&mdash;was ruthlessly demolished. The Old Town
was enclosed in a ring.</p>

<p>Desirous, next, of putting an end to the annoying exodus of the
natives, he fixed by law the number of inhabitants; there were to
be five hundred souls, neither more nor less. If in any one year
the population exceeded that figure, the surplus was taken away,
from among the adult males, to work as galley-slaves in his fleet;
a deficiency in the requisite number was met by giving new husbands
from the lower town, often three or four at a time "with a view to
ensuring good results," to those of the native women who had
hitherto failed to produce offspring. The system worked well. With
some trifling but reprehensive fluctuations, the birth-rate and the
death-rate remained even; things were at a standstill; a fact which
caused His Highness to be compared, by a courtly panegyrist, to
Joshua who bade the sun arrest his march across the heavens.
Another of these gentlemen calls the Duke's action a "triumph of
art over nature," adding, not without a grain of malice, that
"never have the generative capacities of mankind adapted themselves
with more conspicuous success to the shape of an unnecessary wall."
Monsignor Perrelli, unfortunately, has nothing whatever to say on
the subject. For reasons which will appear anon, he is remarkably
silent on all that concerns the reign of his great
contemporary.</p>

<p>Even so the Prince was not satisfied. The fastness was yet
imperfect; he disliked the variegated hues of the
buildings&mdash;they reminded him of the garish brilliance in the
lower town. Something different had to be contrived. He took
thought and, being a man of taste and a decorist where picturesque
effects were concerned, decreed that the entire place&mdash;walls,
houses, the two convents (Benedictine and Carthusian), the church,
and even stables and pigsties&mdash;was to be painted a uniform
pink: "pink," he ordained, "without the slightest admixture of
blue." He desired, in fact, a kind of rose or flesh colour, a
particular tint which, he foresaw, would look well among the
luscious verdure of the surroundings. His behest, as usual, was
obeyed without much loss of time.</p>

<p>Then he surveyed his work, and saw that it was good. He had
created a gem. The Old Town was a symphony in emerald and
coral.</p>

<p>So it remained. The inhabitants grew to be proud of their rosy
citadel; it was an unwritten law among them that every new house
should adapt itself to this tone. For the rest, there was not much
building done after his death, with the exception of a few isolated
villas that sprang up, despite his old commands, in the
neighbourhood. And the decline in population once more set in. Men
forsook the place&mdash;all save the peasantry who tilled the
surrounding fields. Towers and battlements crumbled to earth;
roadways heaved uneasily with grassy tufts that sprouted in the
chinks of the old paving-blocks. Sometimes at decline of day a
creaking hay-waggon would lumber along, bending towards a courtyard
in whose moss-grown recesses you discerned stacks of golden maize
and pumpkins; apples and plum-trees, nodding drowsily over walls,
littered the streets with snowy blossoms or fallen leaves.
Commercial life was extinct. The few remaining shopkeepers wore an
air of slumberous benevolence. The very stones suggested peace. A
mellow and aristocratic flavour clung to those pink dwellings that
nestled, world&mdash;forgotten, in a green content...</p>

<p>One of those few modern houses was the Villa Mon Repos. There
was a curious history attached to the place. It had been built
about a century ago at the orders of an eccentric French lady, a
lyric poetess, who professed to be tired of life. She had heard
that somewhere on Nepenthe was a towering precipice, unique of its
kind and convenient for suicidal purposes. She thought she would
like to live near that precipice&mdash;it might come in handy.
There was nothing of the right sort in Paris, she declared; only
five-storey hotels and suchlike; the notion of casting herself down
from one of those artificial eminences did not appeal to her
high-strung temperament; she craved to die like Sappho, her ideal.
An architect was despatched, the ground purchased, the house built
and furnished. That done, she settled up her affairs in France and
established herself at Mon Repos. On the evening of her arrival she
climbed the little height at the back of her domain and looked
southward, down a sheer wall of rock eight or nine hundred feet
high, over the wrinkled ocean. It made her feel queer. Further
familiarity with the precipice did not breed contempt; her visits
to the site became rarer and rarer. She died, at a patriarchal age,
in her bed, after writing a scholarly pamphlet to prove that the
tale of Sappho's leap over her famous silvery crag was a myth, the
"purest sensationalism," a fable of the grammarians "hopelessly
irreconcilable with what we know of that great woman's
character."</p>

<p>This much the bishop had learnt from Mr. Keith. That gentleman
liked the Sappho story; he called it absolutely true to human
nature and so creditable to the old lady's intelligence that he
would have insisted upon paying his respects to her had she not
expired a good many years before his arrival on the island. And he,
of course, got it from Eames who, as annotator of Perrelli's
<i>Antiquities</i>, was in the habit of garnering old details anent
private houses and so forth, and had possessed himself, in the
course of his researches, of this particular pamphlet which he
intended to reprint, together with others of its kind, in an
appendix entitled, "Contemporary Social History."</p>

<p>The driving road terminated at the Old Town. Mr. Heard,
descending from his carriage, followed a pathway which had been
described to him by Denis and soon found himself at the entrance of
the Villa Mon Repos. It was an inconspicuous little place,
surrounded by three or four chestnut trees and a rose garden. A
steep incline at the back of the property ended, abruptly, in air.
He concluded that the precipice must be on the other side of that
slope and that, if so, it was rather too near the house for his
taste. Mr. Heard thoroughly understood the feelings of the French
poetess. He, too, was not fond of precipices. It was as much as he
could do to look down from a church tower without growing
dizzy.</p>

<p>On the house-steps, beside an empty cradle, sat a shrivelled
hag&mdash;a gaunt, forbidding anatomy, with hooked nose and brown
skin. Tousled grey hair, like that of a Skye terrier, hung over her
forehead, half concealing a pair of coal-black eyes. She rose up,
barred the entrance with one claw-like hand, and scrutinized him
distrustfully.</p>

<p>"A Cerberus!" he thought. "This must be the old lady who
understands Hindustani. Now I wonder if she knows English?"</p>

<p>She seemed to understand that language too; or perhaps his
kindly face disposed her in his favour. He was allowed to pass
within.</p>

<p>The house was empty. Mrs. Meadows had presumably gone out for a
ramble, taking the child with her. He sat down and waited, glancing
round the premises. It was a peaceful sort of abode, pervaded by a
strong sense of home. It appealed to the bishop, who had domestic
instincts and, despite his youth, was already a little weary of
tossing about the world. He envied his cousin's happy married life.
Would such an existence ever fall to his own lot? Although, like
himself, she was only a bird of passage on Nepenthe, she had
succeeded in impressing her personality upon those rather scantily
furnished rooms and filling them with an atmosphere of England.
Heavy bowls of fresh roses were ranged about. But what was she
like, after all these years? Would she recognize him? Had she heard
of his arrival on the island?</p>

<p>Mrs. Meadows failed to return. Perhaps she had met some friend
of neighbour who was keeping her to dinner together with the child.
The old woman seemed unwilling or unable to give him any
information as to her whereabouts. After waiting an hour, he
scribbled a short note, left it on the writing-table, and took his
leave. The eyes of that fierce creature followed him right out of
the garden. So did the scent of roses...</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to its close as Mr. Heard, in a
placid, contemplative frame of mind, once more drew nigh the pink
ramparts of the Old Town, purposing to find his way home on
foot.</p>

<p>He entered the most westerly of its four gateways. There were
stone seats within the structure on either side of the road,
convenient for sheltering from sun or rain. Passing under the
vaulted roof he met Count Caloveglia, that handsome soldier-like
personality, who instantly recognized him and greeted him in
friendliest fashion.</p>

<p>"Will you do me the pleasure of coming to my house, and allow me
to offer you a cup of tea? It is visible from here&mdash;that
rounded portal, do you see? with the fig tree leaning over the
street. Only a hundred yards. Or perhaps we can rest awhile under
this archway and converse. It is always pleasant to watch the
movements of the country-folk, and there is a peculiar charm in
this evening light. Well, let us sit down then. I observe you are
interested in those people. A singular illusion, is it not?"</p>

<p>He referred to a group of men and boys who, stripped to the
waist, were bearing aloft immense masses of some argent-coloured
rock.</p>

<p>"You've guessed my thoughts," replied the bishop. "How on earth
are they able to support such a weight? They remind me of Atlas
with the world on his shoulders."</p>

<p>"It is pumice-stone&mdash;one of the old industries of the
place. They excavate it on the hill-side yonder. Volcanic stuff.
There are several suchlike indications of subterranean fires; a hot
spring, for instance, which the people regard with a kind of
superstitious awe. It is dedicated to Saint Elias and believed to
stand in mysterious sympathy with the volcano on the mainland. You
will observe too, sooner or later, something fiery and incalculable
in the temperament of the natives. Perhaps it is due to the wine
grown on these scorching slopes. If geologists are right, we are
sitting at this moment on the crater of a volcano&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me! That might be rather awkward. I suppose this pumice is
very light?"</p>

<p>"Light as foam. But who can believe it? The bearers move within
a few feet of us, and yet it resembles the most ponderous limestone
or granite. Then you ask yourself: How is it possible? If their
burden were what it seems to be, they would be crushed to earth
instead of striding proudly along. Admirable figures! As you say,
the spectacle takes one back into mythological times. Would you not
call it a procession of Titans, children of the Gods, storing up
mountain-blocks for some earth-convulsing battle? Your eyes deceive
you. Like Thomas, the doubting apostle, you must touch with your
hands. And even then you are not wholly convinced. To me, who knows
the capacity of human bone and muscle, these men are a daily
miracle. They mock my notions of what is permissible. How hard it
is, sometimes, to trust the evidence of one's senses! How
reluctantly the mind consents to reality! The industry is
decaying," he added, "but I hope it will outlive my time."</p>

<p>"Everything seems to decay up here in sober and gracious
fashion. I am delighted, Count, with your Old Town. There is an
autumnal flavour about the place. It is a poet's dream. Some
philosopher might dwell here&mdash;some sage who has grown weary of
disentangling life's threads."</p>

<p>Rarely did Mr. Heard use florid and sentimental language like
this. The soft light, the reposeful surroundings, the homelike
influence of the Villa Mon Repos&mdash;all had conspired to put him
into an uncommonly idyllic mood of mind. He felt disposed to linger
with the kindly stranger who seemed so much more communicative and
affable than on the occasion of those theatricals. He lit a
cigarette and watched, for a while, the flow of life through that
gateway. Its passage was pierced, like the eye of a needle, with a
slender shaft of light from the westering sun. Fine particles of
dust, suspended overhead, enveloped the homeward moving peasantry
in a tender mist of gold.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Count. "This citadel is a microcosm of what
the world might be, if men were reasonable. Not all men! A great
proportion must be good enough to remain what they are. We could
not live without those whose business it is to bring the
reasonableness of the few into its proper relief. Were it
otherwise, there would be no more reasonableness on earth, would
there?"</p>

<p>"And that would be a pity," observed Mr. Heard. "I was much
interested, Count, in what you said yesterday. You spoke of the
Mediterranean becoming once more the center of human activity.
There is an attraction in the idea to one who, like myself, has
been brought up on the classics and has never forgotten his
spiritual debt to antiquity. But I question whether the majority of
my countrymen would be moved by such considerations."</p>

<p>The old man replied:</p>

<p>"I think we need not trouble about majorities. No one can expect
a majority to be stirred by motives other than ignoble. Your
English majority, in particular, is quite unaware of its debt to
us: why should it turn eyes in our direction? But as for other
Northern men, the enlightened ones&mdash;I cannot help thinking
that they will come to their senses again one of these days. Oh
yes! They will recover their sanity. They will perceive under what
artificial and cramping conditions, under what false standards,
they have been living; they will realize the advantages of a
climate where nature meets you half-way. I know little of England,
but the United States are pretty familiar to me; the two climates,
I imagine, cannot be very dissimilar. That a man should wear
himself to the bone in the acquisition of material gain is not
pretty. But what else can he do in lands adapted only for wolves
and bears? Without a degree of comfort which would be superfluous
hereabouts, he would feel humiliated. He must become strenuous if
he wishes to rise superior to his inhospitable surroundings."</p>

<p>"We think a good deal of strenuousness," objected the
bishop.</p>

<p>"Have you not noticed that whenever anything, however fantastic,
is imposed upon men by physical forces, they straightway make a god
of it? That is why you deify strenuousness. You dare not forgo it.
The Eskimo doubtless deifies seal-blubber; he could not survive
without it. Yet nobody would be an Eskimo if he had a chance of
bettering his condition. By all means let us take life seriously.
But let us be serious about things that matter."</p>

<p>"Things that matter, Count! Is it not creditable for a man to
support his wife and family in the best conditions possible?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. But chosen spirits will do this in regions where the
same results can be obtained with a smaller outlay of vital force.
We have only a certain amount of energy at our disposal. It is not
seemly to consume every ounce of it in a contest with brute nature.
Man is made for better things. Whatever fails to elevate the mind
is not truly profitable. Tell me, sir, how shall the mind be
elevated if the body be exhausted with material preoccupations?
Consider the complex conditions under which a Northern family is
obliged to live. Think of the labour expended upon that unceasing
duel with the elements&mdash;the extra clothing and footwear and
mufflers and mantles, the carpets, the rugs, the abundant and
costly food required to keep the body in sound working condition,
the plumbing, the gas, the woodwork, the paintings and repaintings,
the tons of fuel, the lighting in winter, the contrivances against
frost and rain, the never-ending repairs to houses, the daily
polishings and dustings and scrubbings and those thousand other
impediments to the life of the spirit! Half of them are
non-existent in these latitudes; half the vitality expended upon
them could therefore be directed to other ends. At close of day,
your Northerner is pleased with himself. He has survived; he has
even prospered. His family is adequately housed and clothed. He
feels 'presentable,' as he calls it, in the eyes of those who share
his illusions. He fancies he has attained the aim and object of
existence. He is too dazed with the struggle to perceive how
incongruous his efforts have been. What has he done? He has
sacrificed himself on the altar of a false ideal. He has not
touched the fringe of a reasonable life. He has performed certain
social and political duties&mdash;he knows nothing of the duties
towards himself. I am speaking of men from whom better things might
have been expected. As for the majority, the crowd, the
herd&mdash;they do not exist, neither here nor anywhere else. They
leave a purely physiological mark upon posterity; they propagate
the species and protect their offspring. So do foxes. It is not
enough for us. Living in our lands, men would have leisure to
cultivate nobler aspects of their nature. They would be accessible
to purer aspirations, worthier delights. They would enjoy the
happiness of sages. What other happiness deserves the name? In the
Mediterranean, Mr. Heard, lies the hope of humanity."</p>

<p>The bishop was thoughtful. There occurred to him various
objections to this rather fanciful argument. Still, he said
nothing. He was naturally chary of words; it was so interesting to
listen to other people! And at this particular period he was more
than usually reflective and absorbent.</p>

<p>Happiness&mdash;an honourable, justifiable happiness&mdash;how
was it to be attained? Not otherwise, he used to think, than
through the twofold agency of Christianity and civilization. That
was his old College attitude. Imperceptibly his outlook had shifted
since then. Something had been stirring within him; new points of
view had floated into his ken. He was no longer so sure about
things. The structure of his mind had lost that old stability; its
elements seemed to be held in solution, ready to form new
combinations. China had taught him that men can be happy and
virtuous while lacking, and even scorning the first of these twin
blessings. Then had come Africa, where his notions had been further
dislocated by those natives who derided both the one and the
other&mdash;such fine healthy animals, all the same! A candid soul,
he allowed his natural shrewdness and logic to play freely with
memories of his earlier experiences among the London poor. Those
experiences now became fraught with a new meaning. The solemn
doctrines he had preached in those days: were they really a panacea
for all the ills of the flesh? He thought upon the gaunt bodies,
starved souls, and white faces&mdash;the dirt, the squalor of it!
Was that Christianity, civilization?</p>

<p>The Count, pursuing some other line of thought, broke out into a
kind of Delphic rhapsody:</p>

<p>"Folly of men! The wits of our people have been blunted, their
habits bestialized, their very climate and landscape ruined. The
alert genius of the Greeks is clogged by a barbaric, leaden-hued
religion&mdash;the fertile plains of Asia Minor and Spain converted
into deserts! We begin, at last, to apprehend the mischief; we know
who is to blame; we are turning the corner. Enclosed within the
soft imagination of the <i>homo mediterraneus</i> lies a kernel of
hard reason. We have reached that kernel. The Northerner's hardness
is on the surface; his core, his inner being, is apt to quaver in a
state of fluid irresponsibility. Yet there must be reasonable men
everywhere; men who refuse to wear away their faculties in a
degrading effort to plunder one another, men who are tired of
hustle and strife. What, sir, would you call the phenomenon of
to-day? What is the outstanding feature of modern life? The
bankruptcy, the proven fatuity, of everything that is bound up
under the name of Western civilization. Men are perceiving, I
think, the baseness of mercantile and military ideals, the
loftiness of those older ones. They will band together, the elect
of every nation, in god-favoured regions round the Inland Sea, thee
to lead serener lives. To those how have hitherto preached
indecorous maxims of conduct they will say: 'What is all this
ferocious nonsense about strenuousness? An unbecoming fluster. And
who are you, to dictate how we shall order our day? Go! Shiver and
struggle in your hyperborean dens. Trample about those misty
rain-sodden fields, and hack each other's eyes out with
antideluvian bayonets. Or career up and down the ocean, in your
absurd ships, to pick the pockets of men better than yourselves.
That is you mode of self-expression. It is not ours.' And
Mediterranean people will lead the way. They have suffered more
than all from the imbecilities of kinds and priests and soldiers
and politicians. They now make an end of this neurasthenic gadding
and getting. They focus themselves anew and regain their lost
dignity. That ancient individualistic tone reasserts itself. Man
becomes a personality once more&mdash;"</p>

<p>He continued for some time in this prophetic strain, the bishop
listening with considerable approbation though, at a certain point
of the discourse, he would have liked to drop a word about
Thermopylae and Marathon. He also knew something of the evils of
Northern industrialism&mdash;how it stunts the body and warps the
mind.</p>

<p>"What a charming dreamer!" he thought.</p>

<p>It was rather convenient for the Count to be able to pass, just
then, for a dreamer.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was an extremely practical old
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Sanidin?" queried Denis almost flippantly, as he held up a
fragment of rock.</p>

<p>He was not particularly eager to hear Marten's answer. He had
thought, only a few days ago, that he would like to be a geologist;
Marten had inspired him with a fancy for that science. The fit was
already passing.</p>

<p>How quickly this geological mood had evaporated. How quickly
everything evaporated, nowadays.</p>

<p>All was not well with Denis. Early that morning he had tried his
hand at poetry once more, after a long interval. Four
words&mdash;that was all the inspiration which had come to him.</p>

<p>"Or vine-wreathed Tuscany..."</p>

<p>A pretty turn, in the earlier manner of Keats. It looked well on
the snowy paper. "Or vine-wreathed Tuscany." He was content with
that phrase, so far as it went. But where was the rest of the
stanza?</p>

<p>How easily, a year or two ago, could he have fashioned the whole
verse. How easily everything was accomplished in those days. To be
a poet: that was a fixed point on his horizon. Any number of joyous
lyrics, as well as three plays not intended for the stage, had
already dropped from his pen. He was an extraordinary success among
his college friends; everybody liked him; he could say and do what
he pleased. Was he not the idol of a select group who admired not
only one another but also the satanism of Baudelaire, the hieratic
obscenities of Beardsley, the mustiest Persian sage, the modernest
American ballad-monger? He was full of gay irresponsibility. Ever
since, on returning to his rooms after some tedious lecture, he
announced to his friends that he had lost an umbrella but
preserved, thank God, his honour, they augured a brilliant future
for him. So, for other but no less cogent reasons, did his doting,
misguided mother.</p>

<p>Both were disappointed. Those sprightly sallies became rarer;
epigrams died, still-born, on his lips. He lost his sense of
humour; grew mirthless, fretful, self-conscious. He suddenly
realized the existence of a world beyond his college walls; it made
him feel like a hot-house flower exposed to the blustering winds of
March. Life was no longer a hurdle in a steeple-chase to be taken
at a gallop; it was a tangle of beastly facts that stared you in
the face and refused to get out of the way. With growing years,
during vacation, he came in contact with a new set of people; men
who smiled indulgently at mention of all he held most
sacred&mdash;art, classics, literature; men who were plainly not
insane and yet took up incomprehensible professions of one kind or
another&mdash;took them up with open eyes and unfeigned zest, and
actually prospered at them in a crude worldly fashion.</p>

<p>He shrank at first from their society, consoling himself with
the reflection that, being bounders, it did not matter whether they
succeeded or not. But this explanation did not hold good for long.
They were not bounders&mdash;not all of them. People not only dined
with them: they asked them to dinner. Quite decent fellows, in
fact. Nothing was wrong with them, save that they held a point of
view which was at variance with his own.</p>

<p>It was a rude awakening. Every moment he was up against
something new. There were quite a lot of things, he discovered,
which a fellow ought to know, and doesn't. Too many of them to
assimilate with comfort. They crowded in upon him and unsettled his
mind. He kept up a brave exterior, but his inner core was
suffering; he was no longer certain of himself. He became easily
swayed and changeful in his moods. That sure touch in lyrics, as in
daily life, was deserting him. His dreams were not coming true. He
was not going to set the Thames on fire with poetry or anything
else. He would probably be a failure. Aware of this weakness, he
looked up to what was strong. Everything was different from
himself, everything forceful, emphatic and clear-cut, exercised a
fascination upon him. He tried in an honest, groping fashion, to
learn what it was all about. That was why he had taken to Edgar
Marten, the antithesis of himself, bright but dogmatic, a slovenly
little plebeian but a man who after all had a determined, definite
point of view.</p>

<p>Denis repeated:</p>

<p>"Sanidin?"</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at it then," said Marten condescendingly,
"though I can't say I'm in a geological temper this morning. The
south wind seems to rot one's intelligence somehow. Hand it here.
Sanidin be blowed! It's specular iron. Now I wonder why you should
hit upon sanidin? Why?"</p>

<p>He, too, did not pause for a reply. He turned his glance once
more down the steep hill-side which they had climbed with a view to
exploring some instructive exposure of the rock. Marten intended to
utilize the site as a text for a lay sermon. Arrived on the spot
they had sat down. As if by common consent, geology was forgotten.
To outward appearances they were absorbed in the beauties of
nature. Sirocco mists rose upwards, clustering thickly overhead and
rolling in billowy formations among the dales. Sometimes a breath
of wind would convulse their ranks, causing them to trail in long
silvery pennants across the sky and, opening a rift in their
gossamer texture, would reveal, far down below, a glimmer of olives
shining in the sunlight or a patch of blue sea, framed in an
aureole of peacock hues. Stones and grass were clammy with warm
moisture.</p>

<p>"It's a funny thing," said Marten, after a long pause. "I've
often noticed it. When I'm not actually at work, I'm always
thinking about girls. I wish I could talk better Latin, or Italian.
Not that I should be running after them all day long. I've got
other fish to fry. I've got to catalogue my minerals, and I'm only
half-way through. For the matter of that, I haven't come across
half as many nice ones here as I thought I would."</p>

<p>"Minerals?"</p>

<p>"Girls. I don't seem to take to these foreigners. But there's
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"You're a queer fellow, Phipps. Don't you ever look at women? I
believe you have the making of a saint in you. Fight against it. A
fellow can't live without vices. Here you are, with lots of money,
stewing in a back bedroom of a second-class hotel and getting up
every morning at five o'clock because you like lying in bed late.
Is that your way of mortifying the flesh? Got a soul, eh? Get rid
of it. The soul! That unhappy word has been the refuge of empty
minds ever since the world began. You're just like a man I used to
know at Newcastle. You can't think what an ass he was. A sort of
eugenical crank, who talked about the City Beautiful where
everybody would lead regenerated lives like a flock of prize sheep.
Everything sanitary and soulful; nothing but pure men and pure
women. An addle-headed theorist, he was, till a woman got hold of
him&mdash;one of the other kind, you know&mdash;and gave him
something practical to think about. That's what will happen to you,
Phipps. I can see it coming."</p>

<p>"I've been analysing myself lately. I find I have too much
romance in my composition, as it is."</p>

<p>"What do you call romance?"</p>

<p>Denis thought awhile. Then he said:</p>

<p>"When a man invests ordinary people or objects or occurrences
with an extraordinary interest. When he reads attributes into them
which they don't possess, or exaggerates those which they do
possess. When he looks at a person and can't help thinking that
there is nobody on earth quite like her."</p>

<p>"Too celestial for me, on the whole. But I'm glad you said that
last part. Glad for your sake, I mean. It shows that you've perhaps
got something better than a soul, after all."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A body. Look here, Phipps. I also have my romantic moments,
though you wouldn't believe it. I can be as romantic as ever you
please. But not when I'm alone."</p>

<p>"I should like to see you in that condition. And talking Latin,
no doubt?" he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I daresay you would," replied the scientist. "Given the
circumstances under which I become romantic, you'll find it a
little difficult. But there's no knowing. Funny things happen
sometimes!"</p>

<p>Denis had picked up another stone. He scrutinized it with close
attention, and then began to turn it round and round in his hand in
an absent-minded fashion. At last he remarked:</p>

<p>"We are not doing much mineralogy, are we? What do you think of
chastity, Marten?"</p>

<p>"Chastity be blowed. It's an unclean state of affairs, and
dangerous to the community. You can't call yourself a good citizen
till you have learnt to despise it from the bottom of your heart.
It's an insult to the Creator and an abomination to man and
beast."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you never gave it a fair trial," suggested Denis.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm not quite such a damned fool as all that. A man
needn't handle everything dirty in order to be doubly sure about
it. If you tell me that a dead donkey smells bad, I'm quite
prepared to believe you without poking my nose into it. Chastity is
a dead donkey. No beating will bring it to life again. Who killed
it? The experience of every sane man and woman on earth. It's
decayed; it ought to be buried. You ask me to give it a trial.
Perhaps I will, when I'm in the same mellow condition myself.
Everything in its proper season. Don't let us reverse the natural
order of things. When we cease to practise, then is the time to
preach. A fellow of your size! And with your good looks, too. Who
knows how many golden opportunities you've missed. Try to make up
for lost time, Phipps. Get rid of conventional notions, if you
value your health."</p>

<p>"I will, when I find them wrong. What do you think of
women&mdash;generally speaking, I mean?"</p>

<p>Marten replied, without a moment's hesitation:</p>

<p>"Thank God I'm a Jew. You must take that into consideration. I
think the Mormons have made a good shot at solving the woman
question, if the question exists at all. Mormonism is a protest
against monogamy. And please observe that it's a protest not on the
part of man alone. It's a protest on the part of woman. Never
forget that. In fact, I don't believe any woman would ever bind
herself to one fool of a man if she had her own way. She wouldn't
marry at all. She needn't, nowadays. She won't, very soon. A man
who marries&mdash;well, there may be some excuse for him, though a
love-match is generally a failure and a money-match always a
mistake. The heroes, the saints and sages&mdash;they are those who
face the world alone. A married man is half a man."</p>

<p>"Ahem!"</p>

<p>Marten was silent.</p>

<p>"I did not ask you to stop," said Denis. "You've got it very
pat!"</p>

<p>"Plain sailing, my boy. It's the social reformers and novelists
who create these artificial conundrums; they want to sell their
rotten literature; they want to make us forget that the only
interesting and important part of the business is what nobody talks
or writes about. What does it all amount to? Man creates
intellectually and physically. He classifies minerals or blasts out
a tunnel. Woman creates physiologically; she supplies the
essential, the raw material; her noblest product is a child. I get
on splendidly with women, because we both realize the stupidity of
the average sex-twaddle. We have no illusions about each other. We
know exactly what we are after. We know exactly how to attain it. I
tell you what, Phipps, Female Emancipation is going to do away with
a lot of cant and idealism. Knock the silly male on the head.
There'll be an end of your chastity-worship, once women are fairly
started on the game. They won't put up with it."</p>

<p>"Disgusting," said Denis. "Go on."</p>

<p>"I'm done. What, sanidin again?"</p>

<p>Denis still held the stone in his hand. He was thinking,
however, of other things. He liked to collect fresh ideas, to be
impregnated with the mentality of other people&mdash;he knew how
much he had to learn. But he would have preferred his mind to be
moulded gently, in artistic fashion. Marten's style was more like
random blows from a sledge-hammer, half of them wide of the mark.
It was not very edifying, or even instructive. Keith was the same.
Why was everybody so violent, so extreme in their views?</p>

<p>Marten repeated:</p>

<p>"Sanidin?"</p>

<p>"It might be sanidin in places," replied Denis. "I do know a
little something about crystals, Marten. I have read Ruskin's
<i>Ethics of the Dust</i>."</p>

<p>"Ruskin. Good god! He's not a man; he's an emetic. But you never
answered my first question. You always hit upon sanidin. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It's rather a pretty word, don't you think?
It would do for a Christian name. Girls' names are so terribly
commonplace. They are always Marjorie, or something. If I had a
daughter, I should call her Sanidin."</p>

<p>"You're not likely to find yourself in that position at this
rate. If I had a daughter, I know perfectly well what I should call
her."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Angelina."</p>

<p>"You would?" asked Denis slowly. "And why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's rather a pretty name, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Not a bad name at all, now I come to think of it. But it sounds
foreign. I thought you did not care about foreigners."</p>

<p>"I don't. But there's one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Denis.</p>

<p>Mr. Marten winked.</p>

<p>The mists had fled from the hilltops; rocks and vineyards, and
the sea at their foot, lay flooded in sunshine. With one accord,
the two young men rose from the ground and turned their steps
homewards. The mineralogical lesson was over.</p>

<p>"Coming to Keith's to-night?" enquired Marten with a fine show
of nonchalance.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I would if I were you. They say he does things properly.
There'll be an awful crowd&mdash;a regular bust-up. He only gives
one of these entertainments a year. Dancing and Chinese lanterns
and champagne in torrents. Won't you go?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps later in the evening."</p>

<p>Denis was perturbed. He scented a rival in this brutalitarian,
though it seemed hardly possible that Angelina should take much
notice of him. Meanwhile, he felt in need of some gentlemanly and
soothing influence, after such an outpouring of vulgarity. He
thought of the bibliographer. He liked Eames; he admired that
scholarly detachment. He, too, might end in annotating some
masterpiece&mdash;who knows? To be a bibliographer&mdash;what a
calm, studious life!</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to Eames," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Really? A colourless creature, that Eames. As dry as a stick; a
typical Don. I promised him a mineralogical map, by the way. You
might tell him I haven't forgotten, will you? I wonder what you can
see in the man?"</p>

<p>"I rather like him," said Denis. "He knows what he wants."</p>

<p>"That is not enough, my young friend!" replied Marten with
decision. "A fellow must want something sensible."</p>

<p>"What do you call sensible?"</p>

<p>"Sanidin, and things like that. Things with pretty names. Eh,
Phipps?"</p>

<p>Denis said nothing.</p>

<p>His friend continued jovially:</p>

<p>"The tavern mood is upon me. I am going to Luisella's to get a
drink. One gets sick of that Club. Besides, I've taken rather a
fancy to that younger sister. The second youngest, I mean; the one
with the curly hair&mdash;you know! I only wish I knew a bit more
Latin."</p>

<p>Luisella's grotto-tavern had become quite a famous rendezvous.
You could drop in there at any hour and always find company to your
liking. Don Francesco had a good deal to do with its discovery; he
discovered, at all events, the second eldest of the four orphan
sisters who managed the house. After a time, having convinced
himself that they were all good penitents and being a kindly sort
of man, he thought that other people might like to share in the
seductions which the place afforded. He took foreign friends there
from time to time, and none were disappointed. The wine was
excellent. Russians, excluded from the Club by Mr. Parker's
severity, frequented the spot in considerable numbers. They were
nicely treated there. Not many nights previously one of the
Master's disciples, the athletic young Peter Krasnojabkin, who was
credited with being a protege of Madame Steynlin's, had
distinguished himself by drinking sixteen bottles at a sitting. He
afterwards smashed a few chairs and things, for which he apologized
so prettily next morning that the girls would not hear of his
paying for the damage.</p>

<p>"It's all in the family," they said. "Come and break some
more!"</p>

<p>That was the way they ran the place, as regards drinks. The
quality of the refreshments, too, was quite out of the common. As
for the girls themselves&mdash;their admirers were legion. They
could have married anyone they pleased, had it not been more in
accordance with the interests of their business, to say nothing of
the personal inclinations, to have only lovers.</p>

<p>As Marten disappeared under that hospitable doorway, I flashed
through the mind of Denis that Eames was a confirmed recluse; he
might not like being disturbed in the morning.</p>

<p>Besides, he was probably at work.</p>

<p>He thought of going to see the bishop. There was a glamour in
the name. To be a bishop! His mother had sometimes suggested the
Church, or at least politics as a career for him, if poetry should
fail. But this one was so matter-of-fact and unpretentious in his
clothing, his opinions. A broken-down matrimonial agent, Don
Francesco had called him. Mr. Heard was not his idea of a shepherd
of souls; he was only a colonial, anyhow. A grey type of
man&mdash;nothing purple about him, nothing glowing or ornate. He
did not get on particularly well with him either.</p>

<p>Besides, he hardly knew him sufficiently to intrude at this hour
of the day.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. He would go to the Cave of Mercury that
very evening. Keith was right. He must try to "find himself." He
wanted to be alone, to think things out. Or perhaps&mdash;no. He
did not want to be alone with his thoughts. They were too
oppressive just then. He required some kind of company.</p>

<p>Besides, Keith had said "full moon." The moon was not yet quite
full.</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>He would see what the Duchess was doing, and perhaps stay to
luncheon. Eames could wait. So could the bishop. So could the cave.
He was fond of the Duchess.</p>

<p>Besides, it was such a quaint place&mdash;that austere old
convent, built by the Good Duke Alfred.</p>

</p>

<p>"That is the worst of dining with a man. You have to be civil
next morning. But surely, Eames, we two need not stand on ceremony?
I am particularly anxious for you to come to-night. Can't you
really manage it? I want you to meet Malipizzo and say a few nice
words to him. You are too aloof with that man. There is nothing
like keeping on the right side of the law."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"The right side of the judge," said Keith. "It is so easy to be
polite to people, and so advisable in some cases. How would you
like to spend a week or two in gaol? He will have you there one of
these days, unless you have placed him under some kind of
obligation. He represents justice here. I know you don't like him.
But what would it cost you&mdash;just a friendly handshake?"</p>

<p>"He cannot touch me. I have nothing on my conscience."</p>

<p>"Conscience, my dear fellow, is a good servant but a bad master.
Your sentiments are English. They will never do in a country where
the personal element still counts for something."</p>

<p>"The personal element signifying favouritism and venality?"
asked Eames. "A pretty state of affairs!"</p>

<p>"The philosopher can only live under a venal government."</p>

<p>"I disagree with you altogether."</p>

<p>"You always disagree with me," answered Keith. "And you always
find yourself in the wrong. You remember how I warned you about
that little affair of yours? You remember what an ass you made of
yourself?"</p>

<p>"What little affair?" enquired Eames, with a tinge of
resignation in his voice.</p>

<p>The other did not reply. Mr. Keith could be tactful, on
occasions. He pretended to be absorbed in cutting a cigar.</p>

<p>"What little affair?" insisted the bibliographer, fearful of
what was coming next.</p>

<p>It came.</p>

<p>"Oh, that balloon business..."</p>

<p>It was not true to say of Mr. Eames that he lived on Nepenthe
because he was wanted by the London police for something that
happened in Richmond Park, that his real name was not Eames at all
but Daniels&mdash;the notorious Hodgson Daniels, you know, who was
mixed up in the Lotus Club scandal, that he was the local
representative of an international gang of white-slave traffickers
who had affiliated offices in every part of the world, that he was
not a man at all but an old boarding-house keeper who had very good
reasons for assuming the male disguise, that he was a
morphinomaniac, a disfrocked Baptist minister, a pawnbroker out of
work, a fire-worshipper, a Transylvanian, a bank clerk who had had
a fall, a decayed jockey who disgraced himself at a subsequent
period in connection with some East-End mission for reforming the
boys of Bermondsey and then, after pawning his mother's jewelry,
writing anonymous threatening letters to society ladies about their
husbands and vice-versa, trying to blackmail three Cabinet
Ministers and tricking poor servant-girls out of their hard-earned
wages by the sale of sham Bibles, was luckily run to earth in
Piccadilly Circus, after an exciting chase, with a forty-pound
salmon under his arm which he had been seen to lift from the window
of a Bond Street fishmonger.</p>

<p>All these things, and a good many more, had been said. Eames
knew it. Kind friends had seen to that.</p>

<p>To contrive such stories was a certain lady's method of
asserting her personality on the island. She seldom went into
society owing to some physical defect in her structure; she could
only sit at home, like Penelope, weaving these and other bright
tapestries&mdash;odds and ends of servants' gossip, patched
together by the virulent industry of her own disordered
imagination. It consoled Mr. Eames slightly to reflect that he was
not the only resident singled out for such aspersions; that the
more harmless a man's life, the more fearsome the legends. He
suffered, none the less. This was why he seldom entered the
premises of the Alpha and Omega Club where, quite apart from his
objection to Parker's poison and the loose and rowdy talk of the
place, he was liable to encounter the lady's stepbrother. Of course
he knew perfectly well what he ought to have done. He ought to have
imitated the example of other people who behaved like scoundrels
and openly gloried in it. That was the only way to be even with
her; it took the wind out of her sails. Keith often put the matter
into a nutshell:</p>

<p>"The practical advantages of doing something outrageous must be
clear to you. It is the only way of stopping her mouth, unless you
like to have her poisoned, which might be rather expensive even
down here, though you may be sure I would do my best to smooth
things over with Malipizzo. But I am afraid you don't realize the
advantages of ruffianism as a mode of art, and a mode of life. Only
think: a thousand wrongs to every right! What an opening for a man
of talent, especially in a country like this, where frank and
independent action still counts its admirers. You have done
nothing, of late, worthy to be recorded in the <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i> of Nepenthe. Twelve years ago, wasn't it, that
little affair of yours? Time is slipping by, and here you muddle
along with your old Perrelli, in a fog of moral stagnation. It is
not fair to the rest of us. We all contribute our mites to the
gaiety of nations. Bethink yourself. Bestir yourself. Man! Do
something to show us you are alive."</p>

<p>To such speeches Mr. Eames would listen with a smile of amused
indignation. He was incapable of living up to the ideals of a man
like Keith whose sympathy with every form of wrong-doing would have
rendered him positively unfit for decent society but for his
flagrant good nature and good luncheons. He suffered in
silence.</p>

<p>He had good reason for suffering. That "little affair" of twelve
years ago was a ghost which refused to be laid. Every one on the
island knew the story; it was handed down from one batch of
visitors to the next. He knew that whenever his name was mentioned
this unique indiscretion of his, this toothsome morsel, would
likewise be dished up. It would never grow stale, though atoned for
by twelve years of exemplary conduct. He felt guilty. There was a
skeleton in his cupboard. He realized what people were saying.</p>

<p>"Know Eames? Oh, yes. That quiet man, who writes. One can't
swallow half those yarns about him; quite impossible to believe, of
course. She overdoes things, the good woman. All the same, there's
no smoke without fire. You know what actually did happen, don't
you? Well; one really doesn't quite know what to make of a fellow
like that, does one?"</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>The bibliographer had fallen in love, after the fashion of a
pure-minded, gallant gentleman. It was his first and only
experience of this kind&mdash;an all-consuming passion which did
much credit to his heart but little to his head. So deeply were his
feelings involved that during those brief months of infatuation he
neglected, he despised, he derided his idol Perrelli. He put on a
new character. While the dust was accumulating on those piles of
footnotes, Mr. Eames astonished people by becoming a society man.
It was a transfiguration. He appeared in fancy ties and spats,
fluttered about at boating parties and picnics, dined at
restaurants, perpetrated one or two classic jokes about the
sirocco. Nepenthe opened its eyes wide till the truth was made
manifest. After that, everybody said he might have discovered a
worthier object for his affection than the "balloon captif."</p>

<p>She was a native of the mainland to whose credit it must be said
that she did not pretend to be anything but what she was&mdash;an
exuberant, gluttonous dame, with volcanic eyes, heavy golden
bracelets, the soupcon of a moustache, and arms as thick as other
people's thighs; an altogether impossible person. Nobody but a man
of genuine refinement, scrupulous rectitude, delicate sense of
honour and kindly disposition would have risked being seen in the
same street with such a horror; nobody but a real gentleman could
have fallen in love with her. Mr. Eames ran after her like a dog.
He made a perfect ass of himself, heedless of what anybody though
or said of him. The men declared he was going mad&mdash;breaking
up&mdash;sickening for an attack of G.P. "Miracles will never
cease," charitably observed the Duchess. Alone of all his lady
acquaintances, Madame Steynlin liked him all the better for this
gaucherie. She was a true woman-friend of all lovers; she knew the
human heart and its queer little vagaries. She received the couple
with open arms and entertained them royally, after her manner; gave
them a kind of social status. Under this friendly treatment Mr.
Eames grew thinner from day to day; he was visibly losing flesh.
The dame prospered. Piloted by the love-sick bibliographer she
gradually waddled her way&mdash;it was uphill work, for both of
them&mdash;into the uppermost strata of local society where, owing
to the rarefied atmosphere, her appetite, to say nothing of her
person, soon gained notoriety. She was known, in briefest space of
time, as "the cormorant," as "prime streaky," as "Jumbo," as "the
phenomenon" and, by those who understood the French language, as
the "ballon captif."</p>

<p>The "ballon captif."...</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">The Ballon Captif</p>

<p>How things got about, on Nepenthe! Somehow or other, this odious
nickname reached her lover's ears. It embittered his existence to
such an extent that, long after the idyll was over, he had serious
thoughts of leaving the island and would doubtless have done so,
but for his re-kindled enthusiasm for Monsignor Perrelli. So
sensitive did he remain on this point that the mere mention of
balloons, or even aeroplanes, would make him wince and feel
desirous of leaving the room; he always thought that people
introduced the subject with malicious purpose, in order to remind
him of this unforgettable peccadillo, the "balloon business," his
one lapse from perfect propriety. Mr. Keith, who confessed to a
vein of coarseness in his nature&mdash;prided himself upon it and,
in fact, cultivated insensitiveness as other people cultivate
orchids, pronouncing it to be the best method of self-protection in
a world infested with fools&mdash;Mr. Keith sometimes could not
resist the temptation of raking up the ashes surreptitiously, after
an elaborate, misleading preamble. He loved to watch his friend's
meekly perplexed face on such occasions.</p>

<p>Heaven knows how long the affair might have lasted but for the
fact that a husband, or somebody, unexpectedly turned up&mdash;a
husky little man with a cast in one eye, who looked uxorious to an
alarming degree. He carried her off in the nick of time to save Mr.
Eames from social ostracism, mental dotage, and financial ruin. Her
mere appearance had made him the laughing-stock of the place; her
appetite had led him into outlays altogether incompatible with his
income, chiefly in the matter of pastries, macaroons, fondants,
ices, caramels, chocolates, jam tartlets and, above all, meringues,
to which she was fabulously destructive.</p>

<p>It took some living down, that episode. He feared people would
talk of it to his dying day; he knew they would! He wished balloons
had never been invented. None the less he stuck it out bravely,
threw himself with redoubled zeal into Monsignor Perrelli and,
incidentally, became more of a recluse than ever.</p>

<p>"It has been a lesson," he reflected. "<i>Semper aliquid
haerebit</i>, I am afraid..."</p>

<p>Ernest Eames was the ideal annotator. He was neither inductive
nor deductive; he had no axe to grind. His talent consisted in an
ant&mdash;like hiving faculty. He was acquisitive of information
for a set purpose&mdash;to bring the <i>Antiquities</i> up to date.
Whatever failed to fit in with this programme, however novel,
however interesting&mdash;it was ruthlessly discarded. In this and
other matters he was the reverse of Keith, who collected
information for its own sake. Keith was a pertinacious and
omnivorous student; he sought knowledge not for a set purpose but
because nothing was without interest for him. He took all learning
to his province. He read for the pleasure of knowing what he did
not know before; his mind was unusually receptive because, he said,
he respected the laws which governed his body. Facts were his prey.
He threw himself into them with a kind of piratical ardour; took
them by the throat, wallowed in them, worried them like a terrier,
and finally assimilated them. They gave him food for what he liked
best on earth: "disinterested thought." They "formed a rich loam."
He had an encyclopaeic turn of mind; his head, as somebody once
remarked, was a lumber-room of useless information. He could tell
you how many public baths exited in Geneva in pre-Reformation days,
what was the colour of Mehemet Ali's whiskers, why the manuscript
of Virgil's friend Gallius had not been handed down to posterity,
and in what year, and what month, the decimal system was introduced
into Finland. Such aimless incursions into knowledge were a puzzle
to his friends, but not to himself. They helped him to build up a
harmonious scheme of life&mdash;to round himself off.</p>

<p>He had lately attacked, in Corsair fashion, the Greek
philosophers and had disembowelled Plato, Aristotle and the rest of
them, to his complete satisfaction, in a couple of months; at
present he was up to the ears in psychology, and his talk bristled
with phrases about the "function of the real," about reactions,
reflexes, adjustments and stimuli. For all his complexity there was
something so childlike in his nature that he never realized what an
infliction he was, nor how tiresome his conversation could become
to people who were not quite so avid of "disinterested thought."
Living alone and spending too much time in unprofitable studies,
his language was apt to be professionally devoid of humour&mdash;a
defect he made heroic efforts to remedy by what he called the
"Falernian system." It was the fault of his mother, he said; she
was a painfully conscientious woman. A man's worst enemies are his
parents, he would add.</p>

<p>So far as was known, Mr. Keith had never written a book, a
pamphlet, or even a letter to the newspapers. He maintained a good
deal of correspondence, however, in different parts of the world,
and the wiser of those who were favoured with his epistles
preserved them as literary curiosities, under lock and key, by
reason of the writer's rare faculty of expressing the most
atrocious things in correct and even admirable English. Chaster
than snow as a conversationalist, he prostituted his mother-tongue,
in letter-writing, to the vilest of uses. Friends of long standing
called him an obscene old man. When taxed with this
failing&mdash;by Mr. Eames, for instance, who shivered at what he
called <i>praetextata verba</i>&mdash;he would hint that he could
afford to pay for his little whims, meaning, presumably, that a
rich man is not to be judged by common standards of propriety. Such
language was particularly galling to Mr. Eames, who held that the
possession of wealth entails not only privileges but obligations,
and that the rich man should set the example of purity in words and
deeds, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>They were always disagreeing, anyhow.</p>

<p>"You exalt purity to a bad eminence," Keith would remark. "What
did you say about the book I lent you the other day? You said it
was morbid and indecent; you said that no clean-minded person would
car to read it. And yet, after an unnecessary amount of arguing,
you were forced to admit that the subject was interesting and that
the writer dealt with it in an interesting manner. What more can
you expect from an author? Believe me, this hankering after purity,
this hypersensitiveness as to what is morbid or immoral, is by no
means a good sign. A healthy man refuses to be hampered by
preconceived notions of what is wrong or ugly. When he reads a book
like that the either yawns or laughs. That is because he is sure of
himself. I could give you a long list of celebrated statesmen,
princes, philosophers and prelates of the Church who take pleasure,
in their moments of relaxation, in what you would call improper
conversation, literature or correspondence. They feel the strain of
being continually pure; they realize that all strains are
pernicious, and that there is no action without its reaction. They
unbend. Only inveterate folks do not unbend. They dare not, because
they have no backbone. They know that if they once unbent, they
could not straighten themselves out again. They make a virtue of
their own organic defect. They explain their natural imperfection
by calling themselves pure. If you had a little money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are always harking back to that point. What has money to do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Poverty is like rain. It drops down ceaselessly, disintegrating
the finer tissues of a man, his recent, delicate adjustments, and
leaving nothing but the bleak and gaunt framework. A poor man is a
wintry tree&mdash;alive, but stripped of its shining splendour. He
is always denying himself this or that. One by one, his humane
instincts, his elegant desires, are starved away by stress of
circumstances. The charming diversity of life ceases to have any
meaning for him. To console himself, he sets up perverse canons of
right and wrong. What the rich do, that is wrong. Why? Because he
does not do it. Why not? Because he has no money. A poor man is
forced into a hypocritical attitude towards life&mdash;debarred
from being intellectually honest. He cannot pay for the necessary
experience."</p>

<p>"There is something in what you say," Eames would assent. "But I
fear you are overstating your case."</p>

<p>"So did Demosthenes and Jesus Christ, and likewise Cicero and
Julius Caesar. Everybody overstates his case, particularly when he
is anxious to do something which he considers useful. I regard it
as a real grievance, Eames, not to be allowed to assist you
financially. Having never done a stroke of work in my life, I can
talk freely about my money. My grandfather was a pirate and
slave-dealer. To my certain knowledge, not a penny of his wealth
was honestly come by. That ought to allay your scruples about
accepting it. <i>Non olet</i>, you know. Let me write you out a
cheque for five hundred, there's a good fellow. Solely as a means
of smoothing over the anfractuosities of life and squeezing all the
possible pleasure out of it! What else is money made for? They say
you live on milk and salad. Why the Hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks! I have all I want; sufficient to pay for the minor
pleasures of life."</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>"A clean handkerchief now and then. I see no harm in dying
poor."</p>

<p>"Where would I be, if my grandfather had seen no harm in it?
Don't you really believe that money sweetens all things, as Pepys
says?"</p>

<p>The diarist was one of Keith's favourite authors. He called him
a representative Englishman and regretted that the type was
becoming extinct. Eames would reply:</p>

<p>"Your Pepys was a disgusting climber. He makes me ill with his
snobbishness and silver plate and monthly gloatings over his gains.
I wonder you can read the man. He may have been a capable official,
but he was not a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a gentleman, except on a tailor's
fashion-plate?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One, at all events; my father. However, we won't labour
that point; we have discussed it before, haven't we? Your money
would sweeten nothing for me. It would procure me neither health of
body nor peace of mind. Thanks all the same."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith, true to his ancestral tenacity, was not easily put
off. He would begin again:</p>

<p>"George Gissing was a scholar and a man of refinement, like
yourself. You know what he says? 'Put money in thy purse, for to
lack the current coin of the realm is to lack the privileges of
humanity.' The privileges of humanity: you understand, Eames?"</p>

<p>"Does he say that? Well, I am not surprised. I have sometimes
noticed gross, unhealthy streaks in Gissing."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what is unhealthy, Eames. Your own state of
mind. You derive a morbid pleasure from denying yourself the common
emoluments of life. It's a form of self-indulgence. I wish you
would open your windows and let the sun in. You are living by
candlelight. If you analysed yourself closely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't analyse myself closely. I call it a mistake. I try to
see soberly. I try to think logically. I try to live
becomingly."</p>

<p>"I am glad you don't always succeed," Keith would reply, with a
horrible accent on the word 'always.' "Heaven shield me from a
clean-minded man!"</p>

<p>"We have touched on that subject once or twice already, have we
not? Your arguments will never entangle me, though I think I can be
fair to them. Money enables you to multiply your
sensations&mdash;to travel about, and so forth. In doing so, you
multiply your personality, as it were; you lengthen your days,
figuratively speaking; you come in contact with more diversified
aspects of life than a person of my limited means can afford to do.
The body, you say, is a subtle instrument to be played upon in
every variety of manner and rendered above all things as sensitive
as possible to pleasurable impressions. In fact, you want to be a
kind of Aeolian harp. I admit that this is more than a string of
sophisms; you may call it a philosophy of life. But it is not my
philosophy. It does not appeal to me in the least. You will get no
satisfaction out of me, Keith, with your hedonism. You are up
against a brick wall. You speak of my deliberately closing up
avenues of pleasure. They ought to be closed up, I say, if a man is
to respect himself. I do not call my body a subtle instrument; I
call it a damned nuisance. I don't want to be an Aeolian harp. I
don't want my sensations multiplied; I don't want my personality
extended; I don't want my outlook widened; I don't want money; I
don't want aspects of life. I'm positive, I'm literal. I know
exactly what I want. I want to concern myself with what lies under
my hand. I want to be allowed to get on with my work. I want to
bring old Perrelli up to date."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow! We all love you for that. And I am delighted to
think you are not really clean-minded, in spite of all these lofty
protestations. Because you aren't, are you?"</p>

<p>If, after such discourse, the bibliographer still remained
mulishly clean-minded, Keith would return to the psychological
necessity of "appropriate reaction" and cite an endless list of
sovereigns, popes, and other heroes who, in their moments of
leisure, were wise enough to react against the persistent strain of
purity. Then, via Alexander of Macedon, "one of the greatest sons
of earth," as Bishop Thirlwall had called him&mdash;Alexander, with
whose deplorable capacity for "unbending" a scholar like Eames was
perfectly familiar&mdash;he would switch the conversation into
realms of military science, and begin to expatiate upon the
wonderful advance which has been made since those days in the arts
of defensive and offensive warfare&mdash;the decline of the
phalanx, the rise of artillery, the changed system of
fortifications, those modern inventions in the department of land
defences, sea defences and, above all, aerial defences, parachutes,
hydroplanes...</p>

<p>Whereupon a curious change would creep over the bibliographer's
honest face. He knew what this talk portended. His features would
assume an air of strained but polite attention, and he generally
broke off the conversation and took his departure at the earliest
moment consistent with ordinary civility. On such occasions he was
wont to think his friend Keith an offensive cad. Sadly shaking his
head, he would say to himself:</p>

<p>"<i>Nihil quod tetigit non inquinavit</i>."</p>

</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was apt to be a bore, but he could do things properly
when he wanted, as for example on the occasion of his annual
bean-feast. There were no two opinions about that. The trees,
arbours, and winding ways of his garden were festooned that evening
with hundreds of Chinese lamps whose multi-coloured light mingled
pleasantly with the purer radiance of the moon, shining directly
overhead. It was like fairyland, the Duchess was wont to declare,
year after year. And Don Francesco who, on this particular night,
clung closely to her skirts in view of that impending conversion to
the Roman Church, replied laughingly:</p>

<p>"If fairyland is anything like this, I would not object to
living there. Provided always, dear lady, that you are to be found
somewhere on the premises. What do you say, Mr. Heard?"</p>

<p>"I will gladly join your party, if you will allow me," replied
the bishop. "This aspic could not be better. It seems to open up a
new world of delights. Dear me. I fear I am becoming a gourmand,
like Lucullus. Though Lucullus, to be sure, was a temperate man.
No, thank you, Don Francesco; not a drop more! My liver, you know.
I declare it's making me feel quite dizzy."</p>

<p>As Marten had foretold, the wine flowed in torrents. There was a
bewildering display of cool dishes, too, prepared under the
personal supervision of the chef&mdash;that celebrated artist whom
Keith had inveigled out of the service of a life-loving old
Ambassador by the threat of disclosing to the police some hideously
disreputable action in the man's past life which His Excellently
had artlessly confided to him, under the seal of secrecy.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel, a commercial gentleman who had got stuck somehow or
other at the Alpha and Omega Club, cast a practised eye over the
wines, chaud-froids, fruits, salads, ices, the lanterns and other
joys of the evening and announced, after a rough computation, that
Keith's outlay for that little show must have run well into three
figures. Mr. White agreed, adding that it did one good to get a
mouthful of drinkable fizz after Parker's poison.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you ought to try the punch."</p>

<p>"Come on then," said White.</p>

<p>They moved away and soon stumbled upon a cluster of bibulous
mortals in their element. Miss Wilberforce was there. She liked to
linger near the fountain-head; the fountain-head, on this occasion,
being a cyclopean bowl of iced punch. The lady was in grand
condition; festive, playful, positively flirtatious. She nibbled,
between her libations, at a savoury biscuit (she hated solid food,
as a rule) in order, she said, to staunch her thirst; she told
everybody that it was her birthday. Yes, her birthday! In fact, she
was quite a different creature from the bashful visitor at the
Duchess's entertainment; she was hardly shy at all.</p>

<p>"Punch and moonlight!" she was saying. "It's all as right as
rain&mdash;birthday or no birthday."</p>

<p>Miss Wilberforce had about forty birthdays in the year, each of
them due to be worthily celebrated like this one.</p>

<p>It was a sad and scandalous business. Better things might have
been expected of her. She was so obviously a lady. She had been so
nicely brought up. While there was still an English Church on the
island, she never failed to attend Divine Service, despite her
Sunday headache. She was often the only member of the
congregation&mdash;she and Mr. Freddy Parker, whose official
dignity and English origin, however questionable his Christianity,
constrained him to put in an appearance. Mortal enemies, they used
to sit on opposite pews, glaring across the vacant building to see
if they could catch each other asleep, responding at irregular
intervals out of sheer cussedness, and trying vainly to feel more
charitable during those moments when the scraggy young
curate&mdash;generally some social failure who raked together a few
pounds from these hazardous continental engagements&mdash;recited
the Gospel according to Saint John. Those days were over. She was
definitely on the downward grade. Three members of the Club and two
Russian apostles were even then engaged in tossing up who should
have the privilege of seeing her home. The lot fell to Mr.
Richards, the excellent Vice-President, an elderly gentleman whose
carefully parted hair and flowing beard made him the very picture
of respectability. To look at him, one would have said that the
dear lady could not be in better hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was a perfect host. He had the right word for
everybody; his infectious conviviality made them all straightway at
their ease. The overdressed native ladies, the priests and
officials moving about in prim little circles, were charmed with
his affable manner "so different from most Englishmen"; likewise
that flock of gleeful tourists who had suddenly turned up, craving
for admission without a single letter of introduction between them,
and were forthwith welcomed on the strength of the fact that one of
their party had been to Easter Island. Even the <i>parroco</i>
could not help laughing as Keith, with irresistible good nature,
seized him by the arm and thrust a <i>marron glac</i> between his
lips. An ideal host! The "Falernian system" was in abeyance that
day. It was the one evening in the year when, in the interests of
his guests, he could be relied upon to remain absolutely sober to
the last moment; a state of affairs which doubtless had its
drawbacks, seeing that it made him, in longer conversational
efforts, rather more abstruse and unintelligible than
usual&mdash;"blind sober," as Don Francesco once said. Even
sobriety was forgiven him. He took the precaution, of course, to
keep the house locked and to replace his ordinary services of plate
by Elkington; people being pardonably fond of carrying away
memories of so enjoyable an evening. Bottles, plates, and glasses
were smashed by the dozen. He liked to see them smashed. It proved
that everybody was having a good time.</p>

<p>A person unacquainted with Keith's nature could never have
guessed what a sacrifice this entertainment was to him. He was an
egoist, a solitary, in his pleasures; he used to contend that no
garden on earth, however spacious, was large enough for more than
one man. And this little Nepenthe domain, though he saw it for only
a few weeks in the year, was the apple of his eye. He guarded it
jealously, troubled at the thought that its chaste recesses might
be profaned, if but for one day, by the presence of a motley
assemblage of nonentities. But a man of his income is expected to
do something to amuse his fellow-creatures. One owes certain duties
to society. Hence this gathering, which had become a regular
feature in the spring calendar of the island. Having once decided
on the step, he did not propose to be bound by conventionalities
which were the poison of rational human intercourse. Unlike the
Duchess and Mr. Parker, he refused to draw the line at Russians;
the Club, too, was represented by some of its most characteristic
members. He often descanted on the social intolerance of men, their
lack of graciousness and generous instincts; he would have made
room for the Devil himself&mdash;at all events in his "outer
circle." Such being the case, it stands to reason that he did not
draw the line at freethinkers. It was sometimes rather hard to know
where he did draw the line.</p>

<p>The red-haired judge, with straw hat and Mephistophelean limp,
was there, looking like an Offenbach villain out for a spree. After
being effusively greeted by the host&mdash;they understood one
another perfectly&mdash;and forced to eat a quantity of some
pink-looking stuff which he could not resist although knowing it
would disagree with him, His Worship, left to his own devices,
hobbled along in pursuit of his new friend Muhlen. He found him,
and was soon relating succulent anecdotes of his summer
holidays&mdash;anecdotes, all about women, which Muhlen tried to
cap with experiences of his own. The judge always went to the same
place&mdash;Salsomaggiore, a thermal station whose waters were good
for his sore legs. He described to Muhlen how, in jaunty clothes
and shining shoes, he pottered about its trim gardens, ogling the
ladies who always ogled back; it was the best fun in the world, and
sometimes&mdash;! Mr. Malipizzo, for all his incredible
repulsiveness, posed as an ardent and successful lover of women. No
doubt it cost money. But he was never at a loss for that commodity;
he had other sources of revenue, he hinted, besides his wretched
official salary.</p>

<p>Wandering along arm in arm, they passed various contingents of
the Russians, male and female, whose scarlet blouses shone brightly
under the variegated globes of light. These exotics were happy as
children, full of fun and laughter; none more so than the young
giant Krasnojabkin, whose name had been coupled by scandalmongers
with that of Madame Steynlin. An admiring audience had gathered
around him while he performed a frenzied cancan in an open moonlit
space; he always danced when he had enough to drink. The judge
looked on with envy. It sickened him to realize that those
far-famed luncheons and dinners of Madame Steynlin were being
devoured by a savage like this. And the money he doubtless
extracted from her! Presently a loud guffaw from some bosky thicket
announced that the friends had been joined by the Financial
Commissioner for Nicaragua. The Trinity was complete. They were
always together, those three, playing cards at the Club or sipping
lemonade and vermouth on the terrace.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Keith," said the Duchess in her sweetest accents, "do
you know of what this entertainment makes me think?"</p>

<p>"Shall I guess?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind! It makes me think that it is very, very
wrong of a man like you to be a bachelor. You want a wife."</p>

<p>"To want a wife, Duchess, is better than to need one. Especially
if it happens to be only your neighbour's."</p>

<p>"I am sure that means something dreadful!"</p>

<p>Don Francesco broke in:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Keith, how about your wives? What have you done with
them? Is it true that you sold them at various Oriental ports?"</p>

<p>"They got mislaid somehow. All that was before my Great
Renunciation."</p>

<p>"Is it true that you kept them locked up in different parts of
London?"</p>

<p>"I made it a rule never to introduce my lady-friends to one
another. They are so fond of comparing notes. Novelists try to make
us believe that women delight in men's society. Rubbish! They
prefer that of their own sex. But please didn't refer to the same
painful period of my life."</p>

<p>The priest insisted:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you gave the plumpest of them to the Sultan of
Colambang in exchange for the recipe of some wonderful sauce? Is it
true that you used to be known as the Lightning Lover? Is it true
that you used to say, in your London days, that no season was
complete without a ruined home?"</p>

<p>"She exaggerates a good deal, that lady."</p>

<p>"Is it true that you once got so drunk that you mistook one of
those red-coated Chelsea pensioners for a pillar-box and tried to
post a letter in his stomach?"</p>

<p>"I'm very short-sighted, Don Francesco. Besides, all that was in
a previous incarnation. Do come and listen to the music! May I
offer you my arm, Duchess? I have a surprise for you."</p>

<p>"You have a surprise for us every year, you bad man," she said.
"Now do try and see if you can't get married. It makes one feel so
good."</p>

<p>Keith had a peculiar habit of vanishing for a day or two to the
mainland, and returning with some rare orchid from the hills, a
piece of Greek statuary, a new gardener, or something. Sowing his
wild oats, he called it. During this last visit he had come across
the tracks of an almost extinct tribe of gipsies that roamed up and
down the glens of those mysterious mountains whose purple summits
were visible, on clear days, from his own windows. After complex
and costly negotiations they had allowed themselves to be embarked,
for this one night only, in a capacious sailing boat to Nepenthe,
in order to pleasure Mr. Keith's guests. And here they sat, huddled
together in dignified repose and abashed, as it seemed, by the
strangeness of their surroundings; a bizarre group stained to an
almost negro tint by exposure to sun and winds and rain.</p>

<p class="caption">The Garden Party</p>

<p>Here they sat&mdash;gnarled old men and sinewy fathers of
families, with streaming black hair, golden earrings, hooded cloaks
of wood and sandals bound with leathern thongs. Mothers were there,
shapeless bundles of rags, nursing infants at the breast. The girls
were draped in gaudy hues, and ablaze with metal charms and
ornaments on forehead and arms and ankles. They showed their
flashing teeth and smiled from time to time in frank wonder,
whereas the boys, superbly savage, like young panthers caught in a
trap, kept their eyes downcast or threw distrustful, defiant
glances round them. Here they sat in silence, smoking tobacco and
taking deep draughts out of a pitcher of milk which was handed
round from one to the other. Occasionally the older people would
pick up their instruments&mdash;bagpipes of sheepskin, small drums
and gourd-like mandolines&mdash;and draw from them strange
dronings, gurglings, thrummings, twangings; soon a group of
youngsters would rise gravely from the ground and, without any
preconcerted signal, begin to move in a dance&mdash;a formal and
intricate measure, such as had never yet been witnessed on
Nepenthe.</p>

<p>Something inhuman and yet troublingly personal lay in the
performance; it invaded the onlookers with a sense of disquietude.
There was primeval ecstasy in those strains and gestures. Giant
moths, meanwhile, fluttered overhead, rattling their frail wings
against the framework of the paper lanterns; the south wind passed
through the garden like the breath of a friend, bearing the
aromatic burden of a thousand night-blooming shrubs and flowers.
Young people, meeting here, would greet one another shyly, with
unfamiliar ceremoniousness, and then, after listening awhile to the
music and exchanging a few awkward phrases, wander away as if by
common consent&mdash;further away from this crowd and garish
brilliance, far away, into some fragrant cell, where the light was
dim.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked Keith of Madame Steynlin, who
was listening intently. "Is this music? If so, I begin to
understand its laws. They are physical. I seem to feel the effect
of it in the lower part of my chest. Perhaps that is the region
which musical people call their ear. Tell me, Madame Steynlin, what
is music?"</p>

<p>"That's a puzzle," said the bishop, greatly interested.</p>

<p>"How can I explain it to you? It is so complicated, and you have
so many guests this evening. You are coming to my picnic after the
festival of Saint Eulalia? Yes? Well, I will try to explain it
then"&mdash;and her eye turned, with a kind of maternal solicitude,
down the pathway to where, in that patch of bright moonshine, her
young friend Krasnojabkin, gloriously indifferent to gipsies and
everything else, was astounding people by the audacity of his
terpsichorean antics.</p>

<p>"Let that be a promise," Keith replied. "Ah, Count Caloveglia!
How good of you to come. I would not have asked you to such a
worldly function had I not thought that this dancing might interest
you."</p>

<p>"It does, it does!" said the old aristocrat, thoughtfully
sipping champagne out of an enormous goblet which he carried in his
hand. "It makes me dream of that East which it has never been my
fortune, alas, to behold. What a flawless group! There is something
archaic, Oriental, in their attitudes; they seem to be fraught with
all the mystery, the sadness, of life that is past&mdash;of things
remote from ourselves."</p>

<p>"My gipsies," said Keith, "are not everybody's gipsies."</p>

<p>"I think they despise us! And this austere regularity in the
steps of the dancers, this vibrating accompaniment that dwells
persistently on one note&mdash;how primitive, how scornfully
unintellectual! It is like a passionate lover knocking to gain an
entrance into our hearts. And he succeeds. He breaks down the
barrier by the oldest and best of lovers' expedients&mdash;sheer
reiteration of monotony. A lover who reasons is no lover."</p>

<p>"How true that is," remarked Madame Steynlin.</p>

<p>"Sheer monotony," repeated the Count. "And it is the same with
their pictorial art. We blame the Orientals for their chill cult of
geometric designs, their purely stylistic decoration, their endless
repetitions, as opposed to our variety and love of floral, human,
or other naturalistic motives. But by this simple means they attain
their end&mdash;a direct appeal. Their art, like their music, goes
straight to the senses; it is not deflected or disturbed by any
intervening medium. Colour plays its part; the sombre, throbbing
sounds of these instruments&mdash;the glowing tints of their
carpets and tapestries. Talking of gipsies, do you know whether our
friend van Koppen has arrived?"</p>

<p>"Koppen? A very up-to-date nomad, who takes the whole world for
his camping-ground. No, not yet. But he'll turn up in a day or
two."</p>

<p>Count Caloveglia was concerned, just then, about Mr. van Koppen.
He had a little business to transact with him&mdash;he fervently
hoped that the millionaire would not forgo his annual visit to
Nepenthe.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to meet him again," he remarked carelessly.
Then looking up he saw Denis, who moved under the trees alone.
Observing that he seemed rather disconsolate, he walked up to him
and said in a fatherly tone: "Will you confer a favour, Mr. Denis,
on an old man who lives much alone? Will you come and see me, as
you promised? My daughter is away just now and will not be back
till midsummer. I wish you could have met her. Meanwhile, I am a
little solitary. I have also a few antiquities that might interest
you."</p>

<p>While Denis, slightly embarrassed, was uttering some appropriate
words, the bishop suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Meadows? Wasn't she coming down to-night?"</p>

<p>"Of course she was," said Keith. "Isn't she here? What can this
mean? Your cousin is a particular friend of mine, Heard, though I
have not seen her for the last six days or so. Something must be
wrong. That baby, I expect."</p>

<p>"I missed her once already," said Heard. "I'll write and make an
appointment, or go up again. By the way, Count&mdash;you remember
our conversation? Wel, I have thought of an insuperable objection
to your Mediterranean theory. The sirocco. You will never change
the sirocco. The Elect of the Earth will never endure it all their
lives."</p>

<p>"I think we can change the sirocco," replied the Count,
meditatively. "We can tame it, at all events. I do not know much
about its history; you must ask Mr. Eames&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is at home," interrupted Keith, "closeted with his
Perrelli."</p>

<p>"What has been, may be," continued the old man, oracularly. "I
question whether the sirocco was as obnoxious in olden days as now,
otherwise the ancients, who had absurdly sensitive skins, would
have complained of it more frequently. The deforestation of
Northern Africa, I suspect, has much to do with it. Frenchmen are
now trying to revive those prosperous conditions which
Mohammedanism has destroyed. Oh, yes! I don't despair of muzzling
the sirocco, even as we are muzzling that often Mediterranean pest,
the malaria."</p>

<p>Keith observed:</p>

<p>"Petronius, I remember, speaks of the North wind being the
mistress of the Tyrrhenian. He would not use such language
nowadays, unless alluding to its violence rather than its
prevalence. Once I thought of translating Petronius. But I
discovered certain passages in the book which are almost improper.
I don't think the public ought to be put into possession of such
stuff. I am rather sorry; I like Petronius&mdash;the poetical
fragments, I mean; they make me regret that I was not born under
the Roman Empire. People are leaving," he added. "I have said
good-bye to about fifty. I shall be able to get a drink soon."</p>

<p>"So you were born out of time and out of place, like many of
us," laughed the Bishop.</p>

<p>Count Caloveglia said:</p>

<p>"It is an academic problem, and therefore a problem which does
not exist for me, and therefore a problem dear to your own
metaphysical heart, to enquire whether a man is ever born at an
inopportune moment. We use the phrase. If we took thought we would
discard it. For what is the truth of the matter? The truth is that
a man, of whom we say this, is born at exactly the right moment;
that those with whose customs and aspirations he seems to be in
discord have urgent need of him at that particular time. No great
man is ever born too soon or too late. When we say that the time is
not ripe for this or that celebrity, we confess by implication that
this very man, and no other, is required. Was Giordano Bruno, or
Edgar Poe, born out of time? Surely no generation needed them more
imperiously than their own. Only fools are born out of time. And
yet&mdash;no; not even they. For where should we be without
them?"</p>

<p>He smiles suavely, as though some pleasant thought was passing
through his mind.</p>

<p>"At any rate a good many people die too soon or too late," said
Mr. Edgar Marten who, after doing full justice to the food and
drinks, had suddenly appeared on the scene. "Often too late," he
added.</p>

<p>Keith, despite his professions of sanity and reason, had an
inexplicable, invincible horror of death; he quailed at the mere
mention of the black phantom. The subject being not at all to his
taste, he promptly remarked:</p>

<p>"The scholar Grosseteste was unquestionably born too soon. And I
know one man who is born too late. Who? Yourself, Count. You were
made for the Periclean epoch."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said that gentleman with a gracious wave of his
hand. "But forgive me for disagreeing with you. Had I lived in that
age, I should be lacking in reverence for what it accomplished. I
should be too near to its life; unable, as you say, to see the
forest for the trees. I should be like Thucydides, a most sensible
person who, if I recollect aright, barely mentions Ictinus and the
rest of them. How came it about? This admirable writer imagined
they were building a temple for Greece; he lacked the interval of
centuries which has allowed mankind to see their work in its true
perspective. He possessed traditional moral standards whereby to
judge the actions of historical contemporaries; he could praise or
blame his politicians with a good conscience. For the Parthenon
creators he had no sure norm. The standards were not yet evolved.
Pheidias was a talented fellow-citizen&mdash;a hewer in stone by
profession: what could he know of the relations of Pheidias to
posterity? Great things can only be seen at a proper distance.
Pheidias, to him, may have been little more than an amateur,
struggling with brute material in the infancy of his trade or
calling. No, my friend! I am glad not to be coeval with Pericles. I
am glad to recognize Hellenic achievements at their true worth. I
am glad to profit by that wedge of time which has enabled me to
reverence things fair and eternal."</p>

<p>"Things fair and eternal," echoed Keith, who was getting too
thirsty and restless to discuss art-matters. "Come with me! I will
show you things fair and eternal."</p>

<p>He led the way to a distant arbour, overhung with a canopy of
blood-red passion-flowers and girt about by design dangled from the
clustering foliage in its roof. Within, directly under the beams,
all by itself, on an upright chair beside a small table, sat an
incongruous, startling, awe-inspiring apparition&mdash;a grimy old
man of Mongolian aspect. He might have been frozen to stone, so
immobile, so lifeless were his features. Belated visitors passed
near the entrance of the shrine, peered within as at some
outlandish and sinister freak of nature, and moved on with jocular
words. Nobody ventured to overstep the threshold, whether from
religious fear or because of something repellent, something almost
putrescent, which radiated from his person. A contingent of Little
White Cows, a kind of bodyguard, stood at a respectful distance
beyond, intent upon his every movement. The Master never stirred.
He sat there to be looked at&mdash;accustomed to homage almost
divine; beatifically inane. Like the Christians of old, he wore no
hat. The head was nearly bald. A long cloak, glistening with grease
stains, swathed his limbs and portly belly, on which one suspected
multitudinous wrinkles of fat. Two filmy lidless eyes, bulging on a
level with his forehead, stared into vacuity; his snub nose grew
out of a flattened face whose pallor was accentuated by the
reflection of the glittering leaves&mdash;it looked faded and
sodden, like blotting-paper that has been left out all night in the
rain. Sporadic greenish-grey hairs were scattered about his chin.
The mouth was agape.</p>

<p>On Mr. Keith's appearance he made no sign of recognition.
Presently, however, his lips seemed to get out of control. They
moved; they began to chatter and to mumble, in childish fashion,
the inarticulate yearnings of eld. Keith said, as though displaying
some museum curiosity:</p>

<p>"Mine is the only house on Nepenthe which the Master still
deigns to enter. I'm afraid he has grown very groggy on his pins of
late; if he sat on any by a straight-backed chair they would never
get him up again. To think that was once a pretty little boy...Poor
old fellow! I know what he wants. They've been neglecting him,
those young idiots."</p>

<p>He departed, and soon returned with a tumbler full of raw whisky
which he placed on the table within reach of the arm. A flaccid,
unwholesome-looking hand was raised slowly, in a kind of
deprecatory gesture; then allowed to fall again upon the belly
where it lay, with the five fingers, round and chalky-white,
extended like the rays of a starfish. Nothing more happened.</p>

<p>"We must go away for a while," said Keith, "or else he won't
touch it. He does not object to alcohol, you know. Whisky has not
come out of a warm-blooded beast. But it's going into one. A kind
of Asiatic Socrates, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"A Buddha," suggested the Count. "A Buddha in second-rate
alabaster. A Chinese Buddha of a bad, realistic period."</p>

<p>"It's odd," remarked Mr. Heard. "He reminds me of a dead fish.
Something ancient and fishlike&mdash;it's that mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a beauty!" interrupted Edgar Marten, sniffing with
disgust. "Eyes like a boiled haddock. And that thing has the cheek
to call itself a Messiah. Thank God I'm a Jew; it's not business of
mine. But if I were a Christian, I'd bash his blooming head in.
Damned if I wouldn't. The frowsy, fetid, flow-blown fraud. Or
what's the matter with the Dog's Home?"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Mr. Heard, who had taken rather a liking to
this violent youngster and was feeling more than usually indulgent
that evening. "Come! He can't help his face, I fancy. Have you no
room in your heart for an original? And don't you think&mdash;quite
apart from questions of religion&mdash;that we tourists ought to be
grateful to these people for diversifying the landscape with their
picturesque red blouses and things?"</p>

<p>"I have no eye for landscape, Mr. Heard, save in so far as it
indicates strata and faults and other geological points. The
picturesque don't interest me. I am full of Old Testamentary
strains; I can't help looking at men from the ethical point of
view. And what have people's clothes to do with their religion? He
can't help his face, you say. Well, if he can't help that greasy
old mackintosh, I'll eat my hat. Can't a fellow be a Messiah
without sporting a pink shirt or fancy dressing-gown or blue
pyjamas or something? But there you are! I defy you to name me a
single-barrelled crank. If a man is a religious lunatic, or a
vegetarian, he is sure to be touched in some other department as
well; he will be an anti-vivisectionist, a nutfooder,
costume-maniac, stamp-collector, or a spiritualist into the
bargain. Haven't you ever noticed that? And isn't he dirty? Where
is the connection between piety and dirt? I suggest they are both
relapses into ancestral channels and the one drags the other along
with it. When I see a thing like this, I want to hew it in pieces.
Agag, Mr. Heard; Agag. I must have another look at this specimen;
one does not see such a sight every day. He is a living
fossil&mdash;post-pleistocene."</p>

<p>He drew off; Keith and the Count, engaged in some deep
conversation, had also moved a few paces away.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard stood alone, his back turned to the Master. Moonlight
still flooded the earth, the lanterns were flickering and
sputtering. Some had gone out, leaving gaps of darkness in the
lighted walls. Many of the guests retired without bidding farewell
to their host; he liked them to feel at their ease, to take "French
leave" whenever so disposed&mdash;to depart "<i> l'anglaise</i>,"
as the French say. The garden was nearly empty. A great quietude
had fallen upon its path and thickets. From afar resounded the
boisterous chorus of a party of revellers loth to quit the scene;
it was suddenly broken by a terrific crash and bursts of laughter.
Some table had been knocked over.</p>

<p>Standing there, the bishop could not but listen to Keith, who
had raised his voice in emphasis and was saying to the Count, in
his best Keithean manner:</p>

<p>"I am just coming to that point. A spring-board is what humanity
needs. What better one can be contrived than this pure
unadulterated Byzantianism. Cretinism, I call it. Look at the
Orthodox Church. A repository of apocalyptic nonsense such as no
sane man can take seriously. Nonsense of the right kind, the
uncompromising kind. That is my point. The paralysing, sterilizing
cult of these people offers a far better spring-board into a clean
element of thought than our English Church, whose
<i>demi-vierge</i> concessions to common sense afford seductive
resting-places to the intellectually weak-knee'd. Do I make myself
clear? I'm getting infernally thirsty."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, my friend. The Russians have got a
better spring-board than the English. The queer thing is, that the
Russians won't jump, whereas the Englishman often does. Well, well!
We cannot live without fools."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was slightly perturbed by these words. A good fellow
like Keith! "<i>Demi-vierge</i> concessions to common sense"; what
did he mean by that? Did his church really make such
concessions?</p>

<p>"I'll think about it to-morrow," he decided.</p>

<p>The Master, when they returned to him, had not budged from his
resting-place. The fingers still lay, starfish-wise, upon the folds
of that soiled homespun; his eyes still stared out of the leafy
bower; his face still wore its mask of placid imbecility.</p>

<p>The glass was empty.</p>

<p>Slowly, as on a pivot, his head turned in the direction of the
bodyguard.</p>

<p>Forthwith some favourite disciple&mdash;not Krasnojabkin, who
happened to be escorting Madame Steynlin to her villa just
then&mdash;darted to his side; with the help of two lady-apostles
known, respectively, as the "goldfinch" and the "red apple," they
conveyed him out of that shelter into the deserted, moonlit garden.
He leaned heavily on the arm of the youth; peevish sounds,
quasi-human, proceeded from his colourless lips. And now he was
almost speaking; desirous, it seemed, of formulating some truth too
deep for human utterance.</p>

<p>"I bet I know what he is saying," whispered Keith. "It's
something about the Man-God."</p>

</p>

<p>The Russian Government is notoriously tender-hearted. But even
the worm will turn...</p>

<p>Scholars who have treated the life of the ex-monk Bazhakuloff
divide it into five clearly marked periods: the probationary,
dialectical, political, illumined and expiatory.</p>

<p>The first began in youth when, being driven from his father's
house by reason of his vagrant habits and other incorrigible vices,
he entered a monastery near Kasan. Despite occasional lapses
prompted by the hot blood of his years and punished with harsh
disciplinary measures, he seems to have performed his monkish
duties with sufficient zeal. It was observed, however, that with
increasing years he became unduly interested in questions of dogma.
He talked too freely; he was always arguing. Being unable to read
or write, he developed an astonishing memory for things he had
heard and faces he had seen; he brought them up at inconvenient
moments. He grew factious, obstreperous, declaring that there was
much in the constitution of the Holy Russian Church which ought to
be amended and brought up to date. What people wanted, he said, was
a New Jerusalem. A violent altercation with his Superior touching
the attributes of the Holy Ghost ended in a broken jaw-bone on the
part of the older man, and the expulsion of the younger. The
dialectical period had set in. The convent inmates, on the whole,
were glad to see the last of him&mdash;particularly the Father
Superior.</p>

<p>We next find him living in a large barn about fifteen miles from
Moscow. The Superior being unwilling to publish the true facts of
the broken jaw-bone, a certain fame, the fame of an earnest but
misunderstood religious innovator, had preceded him. Adherents,
barely twenty at first, gathered to his side. These disciples,
humble analphabetics like himself, have left us no word of what
passed at those long discussions. Certain it is that he now began
to formulate the rules of his Revised Church. They were to live on
charity, to go bare-headed, and to wear red blouses&mdash;like the
Christians of old. The charm of these simple regulations spread
abroad, and gained him fresh recruits. There were now some cultured
folk among them, who collected his saying into the <i>Golden
Book</i>. He decided to limit his disciples to the "Sacred Number
63," and to call them "Little White Cows." Asked why he chose this
title, he answered that cows were pure and useful animals without
which humanity could not live; even so were his disciples. The
innate good sense of this speech increased his reputation. About
this time, too, he would sometimes prophesy, and undergo long
periods of motionless self-abstraction. At the end of one of these
latter, after tasting no food or drink for three and a half hours,
he gave utterance to what was afterwards known as the First
Revelation. It ran to this effect: "The Man-God is the Man-God, and
not the God-Man." Asked how he arrived at so stupendous an
aphorism, he answered that it just came to him. There were troubles
in the neighbourhood over the audacity of this utterance; some
called it a divine inspiration, to the majority it was known as the
Unnamable Heresy. For a brief while the town was formed into two
camps, and the Chief of Police, a prudent official, was at his
wit's end what to do with these inflammable elements, seeing that
the ex-monk's followers had now swelled to several hundreds and
contained not a few of the more influential aristocrats of the
city. In this dilemma, he applied for instruction to the Procurator
of the Holy Synod. That gentleman, having considered the case,
rashly decided that a visionary of this stamp might be useful for
furthering certain projects of his own. He hoped, by placing under
an obligation, to fashion out of the young reformer an amenable
instrument&mdash;a miscalculation which he lived (though not for
long) to repent. Under the Procurator's aegis, Bazhakuloff was
summoned to the Capital. The political period was beginning.
Moscow, on the whole, was glad to see the last of
him&mdash;particularly the Chief of Police.</p>

<p>There began the most brilliant epoch of his life. By steps which
it is needless to trace, he fought and wormed his way into the
favour of the Court. A good deal of his worldly success may well
have been due, as his enemies assert, to an incredible mixture of
cringing, astuteness, and impudence. It stands to reason, however,
that a man of this type must have possessed sterling qualities of
his own to be found occupying&mdash;all this was years and years
ago&mdash;a suite of apartments in the Palace, where he lived in
splendour, a Power behind the Throne, the Confidental Adviser of
the Highest Circles. His monkish garb was soon encrusted with
orders and decorations, no State function was complete without his
presence, no official appointment, from the highest and lowest
sphere of government, was held to be valid without his sanction.
Red blouses, one of several keys to his favour, could be counted by
thousands. He crushed opposition with an iron hand. He wrought a
miracle or two; but what chiefly accounted for the almost divine
veneration in which he was held was a succession of lucky
prophecies&mdash;none luckier than that wherein, during one of his
moments of inspired self-abstraction, he foretold the early and
violent death of the former protector, the man to whom he owed this
rise to the pinnacles of fame. For even so it fell out. Not many
days later the Procurator of the Holy Synod was found murdered in
bed by an unknown hand. A certain journalist, writing from
Switzerland, boldly states that the Procurator was murdered at the
instigation of Bazhakuloff and claims to have heard, from an
eye-witness whom he does not name, of a bitter quarrel between the
two on the subject of a certain lady as to whose identity we are
also left in doubt. It may be true; such things have happened ere
now. This particular writer's credibility, however, is none of the
best; he has been convicted over and over again of forcing the note
in his diatribes against what he calls "retrogression into
idolatry." There was certainly a good deal of unrest in the country
during the period of the ex-monk's ascendency; no less than 13,783
persons had been banished to Siberia, and 3,756 executed at his
orders. Yet nothing, it seemed, could shatter his position when,
with appalling suddenness, a thunderbolt descended. Nobody knows to
this day what took place. It was something Russian; some scandal in
the Highest Spheres which may see the light of day, centuries
hence, when the Imperial Archives are disclosed as musty court
history to the eyes of students curious in such matters. At this
crisis, when 44,323 persons, mostly liberals, were awaiting trial
in the prisons of the Capital, the ex-monk would doubtless have
been quietly removed after the fashion of court favourites, not by
his adherents, now numbering many hundred thousands, threatened a
revolution. A secret compromise was effected. He was banished, with
every outward mark of disgrace, to a monastery in the remote and
inhospitable region of Viatka, there to meditate upon the
instability of human affairs. The illumined period was drawing
nigh. The Capital, on the whole, was glad to see the last of
him&mdash;particuarly the prisoners awaiting trial.</p>

<p>The diet and discipline nearly killed him at first. He was
consoled by knowing that his fame had spread far and wide. The
Court being unwilling to publish the true facts of his disgrace, he
was regarded as a martyr, a victim of political intrigue, an
injured saint. Disciples multiplied. The <i>Golden Book</i> was
filled with priceless sayings&mdash;wise and salutary maxims which
echoed from end to end of the country. The New Jerusalem took on a
definite shape; the nucleus of the movement, the initiated among
his followers, were retained as the "Sacred 63"; he called them his
apostles and himself their Messiah, which some people thought
rather presumptuous of him. His reputation for sanctity became such
that he was once more a power to be reckoned with; the Court, in
fact, was on the verge of receiving him into favour again, when the
Second Revelation was announced. It ran to this effect: Flesh and
blood of warm-blooded beasts is Abomination to the Little White
Cows. Asked how he contrived to formulate so novel and tremendous a
proposition, he answered that it just came to him. His
followers&mdash;there were about three million of them
now&mdash;instantly refused to touch the Unclean Thing, and all
would have gone well but for the fact that the Army was tinctured
with the New Faith, and that the Grand Dukes had recently become
involved in extensive and lucrative contracts for supplying the
troops with mean. The soldiery refusing to eat either beef or
mutton or pork, percentages declined. These leaders took up a firm
patriotic attitude. The health and morale of the entire Army, they
declared, was dependent upon a sound nutritive diet obtainable only
through the operation of certain radioactive oxydised
magneto-carbon-hydrates which exist nowhere save in the muscular
tissue of animals. This new heresy endangered the very foundations
of Empire! They were not people to compromise where questions of
national prosperity were concerned. They suggested, privately, that
he should cancel his Revelation. He refused. They then sent him a
confidential messenger offering the choice of assassination or
deportation within the space of three hours. He inclined to the
latter alternative, and was straightway conveyed to the frontier by
special train with as many rouble notes in his pocket as he had
been able to scrape together in the flurry of departure. Some
disturbances broke out when the news of his banishment became
known; a few whiffs of grape-shot worked wonders. The majority of
his adherents abjured their error; the rest of them, aided by
charitable contributions from a secret committee of enthusiasts,
found their way abroad to dwell under the shadow of the banished
Messiah. The expiatory period was approaching. Russia, on the
whole, was glad to see the last of him&mdash;particularly the Grand
Ducal party.</p>

<p>A broken man, he decided to establish himself on Nepenthe, drawn
thither partly on account of the climate but chiefly by the report
of its abounding lobsters and fishes, an article of diet of which
he was inordinately fond. Disciples followed singly, and in
batches. Their scarlet blouses became a familiar object in the
streets of the place; good-natured and harmless folks for the most
part who, if they ran up bills with the local trades-people which
they failed to pay, did so not out of natural dishonesty but
because they had no money. They used to bathe, in summertime, at a
certain little cove near the foot of the promontory on which Madame
Steynlin's villa was situated. She watched their naked antics at
first with disapproval&mdash;what could you expect, she would say,
from Russians? Then she observed them eating raw crabs and things.
It struck her that they must be hungry. Being a lady of the
sentimental type, childless, and never so happy as when feeding or
mothering somebody, she took to sending them down baskets of food,
or carrying it herself. They were so poor, so far from their homes,
so picturesque in those red shirts and leathern belts!</p>

<p>Of late years Madame Steynlin had given up marrying, having at
last, after many broken hopes, definitely convinced herself that
husbands were only after her money. Rightly or wrongly, she wanted
to be loved for herself; loved, she insisted, body and soul. Even
as the fires of Erebus slumber beneath their mantle of ice, she
concealed, under a varnish of conventionality&mdash;the crust was
not so thick in her case&mdash;a nature throbbing with passion. She
was everlastingly unappeased, because incurably romantic. All life,
she truly declared, is a search for a friend. Unfortunately she
sought with her eyes open, having never grasped the elementary
truth that to find a friend one must close one eye: to keep
him&mdash;two. She always attributed to men qualities which, she
afterwards discovered, they did not possess. Her life since the
marrying period had been a breathless succession of love affairs,
each more eternal than the last.</p>

<p>In matters such as these, Madame Steynlin was the reverse of the
Duchess. True to her ideal of La Pompadour, that lady did not mind
how many men danced attendance on her&mdash;the more the merrier.
Nor did she bother about their ages; for all she cared, they might
be, and often were, the veriest crocks. She was rather particular,
however, about stiff collars and things; the appearance and
conversation of her retinue, she avowed, should be of the kind to
pass muster in good society. Madame Steynlin liked to have not more
than one man escorting her at a time, and he should be young,
healthy-looking, and full of life. In regard to minor matters she
preferred, if anything, Byronic collars to starched ones; troubling
little, for the rest, what costume her cavalier was wearing or what
opinions he expressed. In fact, she liked youngsters to be frank,
impetuous, extravagant in their views and out of the common rut.
The two ladies had been likened to Divine and Earthly Love, or to
Venus Urania and Venus Pandemos&mdash;a comparison which was
manifestly unfair to both of them.</p>

<p>It was during this summer bathing that Madame Steynlin had made
acquaintance of what was, at the time, the Master's favourite
disciple. His name happened to be Peter&mdash;Peter Arsenievitch
Krasnojabkin. He was a fine son of earth&mdash;a strapping young
giant who threw himself into eating, drinking, and other joys of
life with enviable barbaric zest. There was not an ounce of piety
in his composition. He had donned the scarlet blouse because he
wanted to see Nepenthe and, like the Christians of old, had no
money. Driven by that roving spirit which is the Muscovite's
heritage and by the desire of all sensible men to taste new lands,
new wine, new women, he professed himself a Little White Cow. It
was quite the regular thing to do. It brought you to the notice of
that secret committee of enthusiasts who paid your travel expenses;
it gave you a free trip to the sunny south. Everyone wondered how
he had managed to rise so rapidly in the Master's graces. Madame
Steynlin now stepped between them. She grew fond of Peter, and
marked him for her own. He fulfilled every one of her conditions as
to age, costume and opinions. Besides, he was always so gloriously
hungry! She invited him to take luncheon once or twice and then
began to take Russian lessons from him. "He is only a boy," she
would say.</p>

<p>Conversing, as best she could, with this child of nature, it
dawned upon her that she had hitherto been mistaken in her estimate
of the Russian character. She began to understand the inward sense
of that brotherly love, that apostolic spirit, which binds together
every class of the immense Empire&mdash;to revere their simplicity
of soul and calm god-like faith. She revised her former narrow
Lutheran views and openly confessed that she was quite wrong in
declaring, as she once did, that what the Little White Cows needed
was "more soap and less salvation." The magic of love! It softened,
not for the first time, her heart towards all humanity and in
particular, on this occasion, towards the rest of the saintly band;
were they not her brothers and sisters? She even knitted six pairs
of warm woollen socks and sent them with a polite message to the
Master&mdash;a message which was left unanswered, though the socks
were never returned. As to Peter&mdash;she called him her Little
Peter or, in his more expansive moments, Peter the Great. Soon he
was always coming to the villa at meal-times and staying for hours
afterwards, while they wrestled with the complexities of Russian
genders. He made no secret of the pleasure he derived from filling
his healthy young stomach at her expense; everything supplementary
to that prime condition he took as a gift from the gods. If he had
not been so simple-minded he could have wheedled any amount of
money out of her. The affair had now been going on for four
month&mdash;quite a long while, as such affairs went.</p>

<p>Not for the first time did Madame Steynlin experience the
drawbacks of her house, as regards natural situation. It was, as
Don Francesco often pointed out, "the most unstrategic villa on
Nepenthe." Ah, that peninsula, that isthmus, or whatever you called
the thing&mdash;what on earth had attracted her to the place? What
demon had tempted her to buy it? How she envied the other
people&mdash;Keith, for example, who, if he had been a man of that
kind, could have allowed any visitor, in the broadest daylight, to
creep in or out of his mouldy old gateway in the wall without a
soul being any the wiser! High-priced horticultural experts had
been consulted as to the best means of thickening the vegetation
and screening the approaches to the house. They had met with scanty
success. The soil was of the most sterile, intractable rock; those
few wind-blown olives were dreadfully diaphanous, and Peter's
blouse visible from afar&mdash;even from the market-place.
Everything got about on Nepenthe. People began to twit her about
the progress of those "Russian lessons." It became quite a scandal.
Signor Malipizzo was more annoyed than any one else. He hated the
whole brood of Russians, and had formed various projects for
uprooting the association from the island. His friend the
Commissioner thoroughly endorsed these views. Often he declared
that something must be done about it.</p>

<p>The Master, despite his seclusion, had heard of the affair. He
was grieved, but not unduly so; he had other disciples to choose
from. Every new arrival from Holy Russia, regardless of sex or age,
spent some hours or days, as the case might be, alone with the
Master in his apartment, in order to be initiated into the Law and
impregnated with its full signification: such was the way of the
New Jerusalem. By this system of spiritual control he could be sure
of finding a successor sooner or later. Besides, the defection of
this favourite disciple was only a drop in the ocean of his griefs.
What secretly preyed upon his mind was that, on the verge of
returning to his former state of worldly prosperity, he had been
inspired to issue that Second Revelation regarding warm-blooded
beasts. He ought to have known about the Grand Dukes, and what a
sacrilegious hot-tempered clique they were! "This comes," he would
say, "of placing the service of God above that of my earthly
masters." It kept him in exile on this island&mdash;the deadlock in
the matter of that Second Revelation. The expiatory period was not
yet over, though Nepenthe, on the whole, would have been glad to
see the last of him&mdash;particularly Signor Malipizzo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Little White Cows lived on: the richer in houses,
sleeping fifteen or twenty in one room after the happy style of
patriarchal Russia&mdash;the humbler folk in old ruins, sheds,
cellars, or even caverns of the rock. You could do that sort of
thing in a climate like Nepenthe, if you were not fastidious in the
matter of owls, bats, lizards, toads, earwigs, centipedes, and an
occasional scorpion.</p>

<p>No Russians dwelt within the Cave of Mercury. It was
inconveniently remote; it was difficult of approach; moreover, it
was haunted. Dreadful rites had been performed there, in olden
times. The walls had dripped with human gore. Death-groans of
victims slain by the priestly knife resounded in its hollow
entrails. Such had been the legend in the days of those monkish
chroniclers in whose credulous pages Monsignor Perrelli,
incredulous himself, had discovered a mine of curious
information.</p>

<p>Then came the Good Duke Alfred. His Highness posed as a
conservative in some matters; it pleased him to revive memories of
the long-buried past. He cared little about ghosts. He liked to
take things in hand. After remarking in his brisk epigrammatic
fashion that "not everything old is putrid," he devoted his
attention to the Cave of Mercury and caused a flight of convenient
stairs to be built, wide enough to admit the passage of two of his
fattest Privy Councillors walking abreast, and leading down to this
particular grotto through a cleft in the rock. Nobody knew what
happened there under his superintendence. Mankind being ever prone
to believe the worst of every great man, all kinds of stupid and
even wicked things were said, though not during his lifetime.
People vowed that he carried on the old traditions, the tortures
and human sacrifices, and even improved upon them in his blithe
Renaissance manner. They were ready to supply circumstantial and
excruciating details of how, disguised, down to the minutest
details of costume, in the semblance of the Evil One, he had sought
to prolong his life and invigorate his declining health with the
blood of innocent children, artfully done to death after fiendish,
lingering agonies. Father Capocchio, needless to say, has some
shocking pages on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Eames, who had made a careful study of Duke Alfred's reign,
came to the conclusion that such excesses were incompatible with
the character of a ruler whose love of children was one of his most
salient traits. In regard to those other and vaguer accusations, he
contended that the Duke was too jovial by nature to have tortured
any save those who, in his opinion, thoroughly deserved it. Indeed,
he was sceptical about the whole thing. Monsignor Perrelli might
have told us the truth, had he cared to do so. But, for reasons
which will appear anon, he is remarkably silent on all that
concerns the reign of his great contemporary. He says nothing more
than this:</p>

<p>"His Highness deigned, during the same year, to restore, and put
into its old working order, the decayed heathen rock-chapel
vulgarly known as the Cave of Mercury."</p>

<p>To put into <i>its old working order</i>; that would sound
rather suspicious, as though to contain a veiled accusation. We
must remember, however, that the historian of Nepenthe bore a
grudge against his Prince (of which likewise more anon), a grudge
which he was far too prudent to vent openly; so bitter and personal
a grudge that he may have felt himself justified in making a covert
innuendo of this kind whenever he could safely risk it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, everything remained as before&mdash;shrouded in
mystery. Being doubly haunted now, by the Duke's victims and by
those earlier ones, the cave fell into greater neglect than ever.
Simple folk avoided speaking of the place save in a hushed whisper.
It became a proverb among the islanders when speaking of something
outrageously improbable: "Don't tell me! Such things only happen in
the Cave of Mercury." When someone disappeared from his house or
hotel without leaving any trace behind&mdash;it happened now and
then&mdash;or when anything disreputable happened to anyone, they
always said "Try the Cave," or simply "Try Mercury." The path had
crumbled away long ago. Nobody went there, except in broad
daylight. It was as safe a place as you could desire, at
night-time, for a murder or a love-affair. Such was the Cave of
Mercury.</p>

<p>Denis had gone to the spot one morning not long after his
arrival. He had climbed down the slippery stairs through that dank
couloir or funnel in the rock overhung with drooping maidenhair and
ivy and umbrageous carobs. He had rested on the little platform
outside the cavern's vineyard far below, and upwards, at the narrow
ribbon of sky overhead. Then he had gone within, to examine what
was left of the old masonry, the phallic column and other relics of
the past. That was ten days ago. Now he meant to follow Keith's
advice and go there at midnight. The moon was full.</p>

<p>"This very night I'll go," he thought.</p>

<p>All was not well with Denis. And the worst of it was, he had no
clear notion of what was the matter. He was changing. The world was
changing too. It had suddenly expanded. He felt that he, also,
ought to expand. There was so much to learn, to see, to
know&mdash;so much, that it seemed to paralyse his initiative.
Could he absorb all this? Would he ever get things in order once
more, and recapture his self-possession? Would he ever again be
satisfied with himself? It was an invasion of his tranquillity,
from within and without. He was restless. Bright ideas never came
to him, as of old; or else they were the ideas of other people. A
miserable state of affairs! He was becoming an automaton&mdash;an
echo.</p>

<p>An echo...How right Keith had been!</p>

<p>"It's rotten," he concluded. "I'm a ludicrous figure, a pathetic
idiot."</p>

<p>The novel impressions of Florence had helped in the
disintegration. Nepenthe&mdash;it's sunshine, its relentless
paganism&mdash;had done the rest. It shattered his earlier outlook
and gave him nothing in exchange. Nothing, and yet everything. That
vision of Angelina! It filled his inner being with luxurious
content; content and uncertainty. It was there, at the back of
every dream, of every intimate thought and every little worldly
phrase that he uttered. He was like a man who, looking long at the
sun, sees its image floating in heaven, on earth&mdash;wherever he
casts his eye. Angelina! Nothing else was of any account. How would
it all end? He drifted along in blissful apprehension of what the
next day might bring. She seemed to have become genuinely
well-disposed towards him of late, though in rather a mocking,
maternal sort of fashion.</p>

<p>The poetic vein had definitely run dry. Impossible to make
things rhyme, somehow. Perhaps his passion was too strong for
technical restraints. He tried his hand at prose:</p>

<p>"Your eyes bewilder me. I would liken you to a shaft of
sunlight, a withering flame&mdash;a black flame, if such there
be&mdash;for your grace and ardour is even as a flame. Your step is
laughter and song. Your hair is a torrent of starless night. The
sun is your lover, you god. He takes joy in your perfection. Your
slender body palpitates with his imprisoned beams. He has moulded
your limbs and kissed your smooth skin in the days when
you...nevermore will you whiten those kisses..."</p>

<p>"It won't do," he sadly reflected, laying down the pen. "The
adaptation is too palpable. Why does everybody anticipate my ideas?
The fact is, I have nothing to say. I can only feel. Everything
went right, so long as I was in love with myself. Now everything
goes wrong."</p>

<p>Then he remembered Keith's pompous exhortation.</p>

<p>"Find yourself! You know the Cave of Mercury! Climb down, one
night of full moon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is something in what he says. This very night I'll
go."</p>

<p>It was particularly hard for him that evening. The Duchess was
dining with a party at Madame Steynlin's; it was an open secret
that the entertainment would end in a moonlight excursion on the
water; she would not return till very late. Angelina would be
alone, accessible. It was her duty to guard the house in the
absence of its mistress. He might have gone there on some pretext
and talked awhile, and looked into her elvish eyes and listened to
that Southern voice, rich and clear as a bell. Almost he yielded.
He thought of the ineptitude of the whole undertaking and, in
particular, of those slippery stairs; one might break one's neck
there at such an hour of the night. Unless one wore tennis
shoes&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, he would wear them. He would resist the temptation and
approve himself a man. Everybody, even the Duchess, was always
telling him to be a man. He would find himself. Keith was
right.</p>

<p>The night came.</p>

<p>He descended noiselessly into the cool and dark chasm, resting
awhile on a ledge about half-way down, to drink in the spirit of
the place. All was silent. Dim masses towered overhead; through
rifts in the rocky fabric he caught glimmerings, strange and yet
familiar, of the landscape down below. It swam in the milky
radiance of a full moon whose light streamed down from some
undiscoverable source behind the mountain, suffusing the distant
vineyards and trees with a ghostly tinge of green. Like looking
into another world, he though; a poet's world. Calmly it lay there,
full of splendour. How well one could understand, in such a place,
the glamour, the romance, of night! Romance...What was left of life
without romance? He remembered his talk with Marten; he thought of
the scientists crude notions of romance. He pitied the materialism
which denied him joys like these. This moonlit landscape&mdash;how
full of suggestion! That grotto down below&mdash;what tales it
could unfold!</p>

<p>The Cave of Mercury...</p>

<p>How had Mercury, the arch-thief, come to be presiding genius
here? Denis knew; his friend Eames had explained everything to him.
Mercury had nothing whatever to do with the site. That name had
been proved by the bibliographer to be the invention of some
pedantic monk who liked to display his learning to a generation
avid of antiquities, a generation which insisted on attaching a
Roman deity to every cavern. It was a wilful fabrication, made in
the infancy of archaeology when historical criticism was
non-existent. And the same with all those stories about human
sacrifices and tortures. There was not a word of truth in them. So
Mr. Eames had decided, after a systematic investigation of both of
the older authorities and of the grotto itself. The legends, too,
were simply invented to give a zest to a locality whose original
antique name had apparently been lost, though he had not yet
abandoned all hope of stumbling across it by one of those lucky
accidents which reward the lover of old parchments and title-deeds.
A pure invention. It was plain the Mr. Eames from what remained of
ancient symbols on the spot, that the cave had been consecrated to
older and worthier rites&mdash;to some mysterious, primeval, fecund
Mother of Earth. Her name, like that of her habitation, had lapsed
into oblivion.</p>

<p>"There is something grand in this old animistic conception,"
Eames had said. "Later on, under the Romans, the place seems to
have been dedicated to Priapic rites. That is rather a
depreciation, isn't it? It brings us down from fruitfulness to mere
lasciviousness. But where are you going to draw the line?
Everything tends to lose its hallowed meaning; it becomes degraded,
bestialized. Still, the roots of the idea are sound. In giving
sensual attributes to a garden god the ancients had in mind the
recklessness, the spendthrift abundance, of all nature&mdash;not
excluding our own. They tried to explain how it came about that the
sanest man is liable, under the stress of desire, to acts of which
he vainly repents at leisure. I don't suppose they meant to justify
those acts. If they had, they would have given a less equivocal
position to Priapus in their celestial hierarchy. Priapus, you
know, was not wholly divine. I think they only wanted to make it
quite clear that we cannot drive out nature with a fork. I wish we
could," he added.</p>

<p>And then he sighed. The poor fellow was thinking at that moment,
of balloons.</p>

<p>Denis remembered this conversation. Earth-worship: the cult of
those generative forces which weld together in one mighty instinct
the highest and lowliest of terrestrial creatures...The unalienable
right of man and beast to enact that which shall confound death,
and replenish the land with youth, and joy, and teeming life. The
right which priestly castes of every age have striven to repress,
which triumphs over every obstacle and sanctifies, by its fruits,
the wildest impulses of man. The right to love!</p>

<p>Musing thus, he began to understand why men of old, who looked
things squarely in the face, should have deified this friendly,
all-compelling passion. He reverenced the fierce necessity which
drives the living world to its fairest and sole enduring effort. Be
fruitful and multiply. He recognized for the firs ttime that he was
not a lonely figure on earth, but absorbed into a solemn and
eternal movement; bound close to the throbbing heart of the
Universe. There was grandeur, there was repose, in being able to
regard himself as an integral part of nature, destined to create
and leave his mark. He felt that he was growing into harmony with
permanent things&mdash;finding himself. He realized now what Keith
had meant.</p>

<p>It cost him quite an effort to tear himself away from that
ledge. He began to descend once more.</p>

<p>Near the entrance of the Cave he paused abruptly. It seemed as
if a sound had issued from the interior of the rock. He listened.
It came again&mdash;a human sound, unquestionably, and within a few
yards of his face. A whisper. There was something going
on&mdash;Earth-worship...</p>

<p>Suddenly a succession of words broke upon the
stillness&mdash;breathless words, spoken in a language which not
everybody could have translated. He recognized the voice. It
said:</p>

<p>"Ego te amare tantum! Non volere? Non piacere? Non capire? O
Lord, can't you understand?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Marten's voice. Mr. Marten was being romantic. No
answer came to his fervent pleadings. Perhaps they were not
coherent enough. He began again, <i>tremolo agitato, con molto
sentimento</i>:</p>

<p>"O ego te amare tantum! Nemo sapit nihil. Duchessa in barca
aquatica cum magna compania. Redibit tardissimo. Niente timor.
Amare multissimo! Ego morire fine te. Morire. moriturus. Capito?
Non capire? Oh, <i>capire</i> be blowed!"</p>

<p>There was a short pause. The language seems to have been
understood this time. For, amid a ripple of laughter, a rich
Southern voice was heard to say with a sigh of mock
resignation:</p>

<p>"<i>Sia fatta la volont di Dio!</i>"</p>

<p>Then silence...</p>

<p>Denis turned. He walked up the steps as in a dream, neither
slowly nor fast. No one was ever more unhappy, though he scarcely
felt as yet the depths of his own humiliation. It was more like a
stab&mdash;a numbing assassin-like stab. He could hear the beatings
of his heart.</p>

<p>He reached the upper level of the town, he knew not how.</p>

<p>All lay quiet as he found his way among the familiar buildings.
It was after midnight; most of the lamps had been extinguished. The
streets were deserted. He heard, in the distance, the song of a
drunken wayfarer reeling homewards from a tavern or from the
Club.</p>

<p class="caption">Miss Wilberforce</p>

<p>In one of the little roadways that converge upon the
market-place something was astir. It was a dim phantom of willowy
outline, swaying capriciously to and fro, like a black feather
tossed by the wind. Miss Wilberforce! She fluttered down a doorstep
and began crooning a vulgar song about "Billy had a letter for to
go on board a ship." Denis moved to the other side of the narrow
path, hoping to escape unobserved. The light was too strong.</p>

<p>"My young friend," she cried in quite a hoarse and altered tone
of voice, "we should know each other! We've had the pleasure
haven't we? Been down to the sea, have you? And what are the wild
waves saying?"</p>

<p>Denis stood there, petrified with disgust. Was it possible? Was
this the lady who had charmed him the other day? Who had spoken of
England and conjured up the memories of his own home in the
Midlands? With a playful gesture, she sent her hat careering across
the street and began to fumble at her breast, unlacing or
unbuttoning something. It was horrible, in the moonlight.</p>

<p>A boot, flying merrily over his head, recalled him to his
senses. He turned to go, and had already made a few paces when the
voice croaked after him:</p>

<p>"Does your mother know you're out?"</p>

</p>

<p>Some good genius took him by the hand next day and led him to
the house of Count Caloveglia, in response to that friendly
twice-repeated invitation. The old man saw at a glance that
something serious was amiss. He plunged at once, with quick
insight, into what he took to be extraneous topics of
conversation.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like my fig tree! It gives a distinctive tone to
this quiet courtyard, don't you think? I could not have wished for
anything more appropriate. Its shape, its associations, are alike
pleasing. The fig is a legendary tree; a volume could be written
about the stories and superstitions which have twined themselves
around it. Some think it was the Biblical Tree of Knowledge. Judas
Iscariot, they say, hanged himself on a fig tree. It came from the
East-Bacchus brought it on his journey as a gift to mortal men. How
much we owe to those of the Greek gods who were yet not wholly
divine! The Romans, too, held it in veneration. You have doubtless
heard about the <i>ficus ruminalis</i>, at hose feet the cradle of
Romulus and Remus was stranded? Among many nations it became the
outward symbol of generative forces. The Egyptians consecrated the
fig to Isis, that fecund Mother of Earth. Statues of Priapus were
carved out of its wood in allusion, possibly, to its reckless
fertility or for some analogous reason; it was also held to be
sacred, I know not why, to Mercury&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denis, during this little speech, had begun to look more
troubled than ever. The other continued:</p>

<p>"There is something in the very twistings of that smooth trunk
and those heavy-laden branches that suggests fruitfulness, How
voluptuously they writhe! A kindly growth, lover of men, their
dwellings and ordered ways. That is why we foster it. We are all
utilitarians here, Mr. Denis; we think of the main purposes of
life. Besides food, it gives us welcome shade at this season; the
leaves fall off in winter and allow the sunlight to percolate into
our rooms. You will not find evergreen trees planted near our
windows. We know the value of sunshine; where the sun enters, we
say, the physician does not enter. In England the light is feebler
and yet they made this mistake, during the Georgian period of
architecture. They thought that houses were invented to be looked
at, not to be lived in. Determined to be faithful to the tradition
and regardless of the difference in climate, they planted the ilex
about those mansions which must be dank and gloomy in wintertime,
however charming, externally, to those who relish the chill
Palladian outlines. You have lately been to Florence, I hear? Come!
Let us sit indoors. The courtyard is rather too sultry to-day, in
spite of the shade. My old servant will bring some tea, presently.
Or perhaps you would prefer some wine and a biscuit? Or a glass of
liqueur?... Well? And Florence?"</p>

<p>"It has left me rather confused, so far," replied Denis. "Some
of the things are overwhelming."</p>

<p>"Overwhelming? That is perhaps because you do not see the
movement in its continuity, because you have not traced the stream
to its source. I can understand your feelings. But one need not be
overwhelmed by these men. They were lovable folks, who played with
their art like some child that has discovered a long-lost toy. It
is a pity that their activities were so hampered by the conventions
of religious dogma. Viewed by itself, the Renaissance may seem
overwhelming; it shoots up like a portentous lily out of the
blood-drenched soil of a thousand battlefields. Let me take you to
its real source."</p>

<p>He showed him that little statuette, the Locri Faun. Denis was
enchanted by it.</p>

<p>"You have heard of Sir Herbert Street? He also thinks highly of
this thing. He is now adviser in art matters to Mr. van Koppen who
is a patron of mine and who, I hear, will arrive to-morrow or the
day after."</p>

<p>"Street? I met him at my mother's house. Wasn't he at South
Kensington? A great man for dining out. You cannot pick up an
evening paper without reading something about him. That kind of
man! All the same, he wrote a good book on the Siena School. I
liked it, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"It is a fair appreciation, from the collector's point of view.
He has stayed with me here once or twice, and given me reason to
form a high opinion of his capacities. Now if you will compare this
Faun with your Florentine art, you will see what I mean by going to
the fountain. There is a difference not only in technique, but in
outlook. The man who wrought this did not trouble about you, or me,
or himself. He had not moods. His art is purely intellectual; he
stands aloof, like a glacier. Here the spring issued,
crystal-clear. As the river swells in size it grows turbid and
discoloured with alien elements&mdash;personality, emotions."</p>

<p>"I have noticed that," said Denis. "It is what we call the
malady of thought. This Faun, you say, was found on the mainland
yonder?"</p>

<p>"Near the site of old Locri, on a piece of ground which still
belongs to me. I suspect there are still a good many Greek relics
to be excavated on the site. We have discovered a Demeter some
years ago; a mutilated head in marble; it is now in Paris. You can
see the very place from my roof here, on bright days. These men,
Mr. Denis, were our masters. Do not be misled by what you are told
of the wanton luxury of those shores; do not forget that your view
of that age has filtered through Roman stoicism and English
puritanism which speak with envy lurking at their hearts&mdash;the
envy of the incomplete creature for him who dares express himself.
A plague has infected the world&mdash;the plague of repression.
Don't you think that the man who made this Faun was entitled to
dine well?"</p>

<p>"I cannot quite make it out," said Denis, still examining the
statuette.</p>

<p>"Ah! How does it make you feel?"</p>

<p>"Uneasy."</p>

<p>"You are unaware of a struggle between your own mind and that of
the artist? I am glad. It is the test of beauty and vitality that a
beholder refuses to acquiesce at first glance. There is a conflict
to be undergone. This thing thrusts itself upon us; it makes no
concessions, does it? And yet one cannot but admire! You will
seldom encounter that sensation among the masterpieces of the
Renaissance. They welcome you with open arms. That is because we
know what the creators were thinking about. They are quite personal
and familiar; they had as many moods, one suspects, as a
fashionable prima donna. They give pleasure. This Faun gives
pleasure and something more&mdash;a sense of disquieting intimacy.
While intruding upon your reserve with his solemn, stark and almost
hostile novelty, he makes at the same time a strange
appeal&mdash;he touches upon chords in our nature of which we
ourselves were barely cognisant. You must yield, Mr. Denis, to this
stranger who seems to know so much about you. When you have done
so, you will make a surprising discovery. You have gained a
friend&mdash;one of those who never change."</p>

<p>"I am trying to," replied Denis. "But it is difficult. We are
not brought up that way, nowadays."</p>

<p>"No. Men have lost their frankness, their self-assurance.
Whoever yields, must be confident of his own strength. Our
contemporaries have lost that feeling. They dare not be themselves.
They eke out lack of sincerity by profusion of commonplace. Unlike
the heroes of Homer, they repress their fears&mdash;they repress
everything, save their irrepressible flatulence of mind. They are
expansive in unimportant matters and at wrong moments&mdash;blown
about in a whirl of fatuous extremes. The impersonal note has
vanished. Why has it gone, Mr. Denis?" he suddenly asked. "And when
did it go?"</p>

<p>The other was rather puzzled what to reply.</p>

<p>"I suppose you could trace its disappearance to the days of
which you spoke, when artists began to display their moods to the
world. Perhaps further still. Some Roman writers were fond of
talking about their own affairs. If they do, the public naturally
becomes interested. People like Byron must have had a good deal to
do with it. He was always harping on his private life."</p>

<p>He paused, but the Count merely asked:</p>

<p>"No further back than that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Christianity made us interested in other people's
feelings. Brotherliness, you know. That must have helped. So did
Socrates, by the way. Of course it lowers the general standard.
Where everybody can read and write, there's an end of good taste.
No, I don't mean that exactly," he added, feeling that he was
expressing himself very stupidly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything! The telegraph and society papers and
interviewing and America and yellow journalism...and all those
family memoirs and diaries and autobiographies and Court
scandals...They produce a new kind of public, a public which craves
for personalities rather than information. They want to learn about
our clothes and incomes and habits. Not a questioning public, I
mean; a prying public&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cannibalistic public," said the Count, quietly. "Men cannot
live, it seems, save by feeding on their neighbour's life-blood.
They prey on each other's nerve-tissues and personal sensations.
Everything must be shared. It gives them a feeling of solidarity, I
suppose, in a world where they have lost the courage to stand
alone. Woe to him who dwells apart! Great things are no longer
contemplated with reverence. They are hauled down from their
pedestals in order to be rendered accessible to a generation of
pigmies; their dignity is soiled by vulgar contact. This lust of
handling&mdash;what is its ordinary name? Democracy. It has abraded
the edge of that keen anthropocentric outlook of the Greeks which
exalted whatever was distinctively human. Men have learnt to see
beauty here, there, and everywhere&mdash;a little beauty, mark you,
not much! They fail to realize that in widening their capacity of
appreciation they dilute its intensity. They have watered their
wine. There is more to drink. The draught is poorer."</p>

<p>It seemed to Denis that the Count's wine had not been
watered.</p>

<p>"Let me show you one or two other things," said the old man.</p>

<p>They wandered about the premises awhile, looking at marbles,
prints, intaglios, coins, till a serving man entered&mdash;a
clean-shaven and rather bony old creature whom the Count called
Andrea&mdash;to announce tea. Denis was feeling calmer; he had
fallen under the beguiling influence of this place. He realized
that his host was different from the artist type he had hitherto
encountered; more profound, more veracious. Already he formed the
project of returning to listen to his melodious voice, and learn
some more about that Hellenic life which had hitherto been a sealed
book to him. Nobody every spoke to him after the Count's fashion.
He contrasted his address with the bantering, half-apologetic,
supercilious tone of those other elderly persons who had heretofore
deigned to enlightened him. He was flattered and pleased at being
taken seriously and bidden to think in this straightforward, manly
fashion; it unstrung his reserve and medicined to his wounded
self-respect.</p>

<p>"So your mother would like to see you in Parliament?" asked the
Count. "Politics are apt to be a dirty game. One cannot touch dirt
without soiling one's hands. We have a deputy here, the Commendator
Morena&mdash;well, one does not like to speak about him. Let me ask
you a question, Mr. Denis. Why do politicians exist?"</p>

<p>"I suppose the answer would be that is profitable to mankind to
be run by somebody."</p>

<p>"Profitable, at all events, to those who do the running. Your
good Sir Herbert Street has lately sent me a batch of books about
the ideal public life of the future. Socialistic forecasts, and
that kind of literature. He is a world-improver, you know, among
other things. They have amused me more than I thought they would.
That venerable blunder: to think that in changing the form of
government you change the heart of man. And in other respects, too,
these dreamers are at sea. For surely we should aim at
simplification of machinery. Conceive, now, the state of affairs
where everybody is more or less employed by the community&mdash;the
community, that comfortable word!&mdash;in some patriotic business
or other. Everybody an official, all controlling each other! It
would be worse than the Spanish Inquisition. A man could live at
Toledo by subscribing to certain fixed opinions; he could be
assured of a reasonable degree of privacy. Nothing could save him,
under socialism. An insupportable world! When people cease to
reflect they become idealists."</p>

<p>"I suppose they do," replied Denis, rather dubiously. Then it
struck him that this might account for his own hazy state of
mind&mdash;this lack of occupation or guiding principle. For the
rest, he had not given much thought to such questions. To be a
politician&mdash;it was one of the few projects which had never
seriously entered his head. After a pause, he remarked:</p>

<p>"I can't help noticing that portrait over there. It's a very
pretty thing."</p>

<p>"The little pastel? It is a sketch of my daughter Matilda. I did
it myself when she was here last Christmas. Poor child, she can
only come for the holidays; there is no chance of a respectable
education o this island. But I can run over to see her every now
and then. You will observe I am not much of a colourist!"</p>

<p>"You have been parsimonious with the tints. It reminds me of
some of Lenbach's work which I saw at Florence; it is in the same
manner."</p>

<p>"It appears you like art," said the Count. "Why not devote
yourself to it? But perhaps your English social conditions are not
propitious. Here is a letter from a friend of mind which arrived
this morning; you know his name&mdash;I will not mention it! A
well-known Academician, whose life is typical of your attitude
towards art. Such a good fellow. He likes shooting and fishing; he
is a favourite at Court, and quite an authority on dress-reform. He
now writes to ask me about some detail of Greek costume which he
requires for one of his lectures to a Ladies' Guild. Art, to him,
is not a jealous mistress; she is an indulgent companion, who will
amiably close an eye and permit a few wayside flirtations to her
lover&mdash;enthusiasms for quite other ideals, and for the joys of
good society in general. That is the way to live a happy life. It
is not the way to create masterpieces."</p>

<p>"I would take myself seriously, I think," said Denis. "I would
not dissipate my energies."</p>

<p>He meant it. To be an artist&mdash;it dawned upon him that this
was his true vocation. To renounce pleasure and discipline the
mind; to live a life of self-denial, submitting himself humbly to
the inspiration of the great masters...To be serene, like this old
man; to avoid that facile, glib, composite note&mdash;those
monkey-tricks of cleverness...</p>

<p>Then, after this vision had passed before his eyes like a flash,
he remembered his grief. The notion of becoming a world-famous
artist lost all meaning for him. Everything was blighted. There was
not a grain of solace to be found on earth.</p>

<p>The Count, meanwhile, was looking with concern upon his
companion's grave face, whose flawless profile might have emerged
into life under the thought-laden chisel of Lysippus. He wondered
what he could say or do to drive away this melancholy. The youth
had been so bright that day at the entertainment of the Duchess; he
seemed to have stepped straight out of a sunny dialogue of Plato.
Serious trouble now shone out of his eyes. Something had happened.
Something was wrong with him; wrong, too&mdash;he
reflected&mdash;with a world which could find no better occupation
for such a person than to hand round buttered tea-cakes at an old
woman's party to a crowd of cosmopolitan scandalmongers.</p>

<p>Denis rose, remarking:</p>

<p>"I wish I could stay a little longer! But it is getting so late.
I'm afraid I must be going."</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"You have caught me in a somewhat sad and depressed mood, I
fear," replied the other, heaving a most artistic sigh. And his
features suddenly looked quite careworn. As a matter of fact, he
had not been so joyous for many long years&mdash;that news of Mr.
van Koppen's proximate arrival having made him feel fifty years
younger and, but for his ingrained sense of Hellenic moderation,
almost ready to dance with delight.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I have been so despondent," he went on. "Sometimes
one cannot help oneself. It shall not occur again! I will try to be
more amusing next time you come. If I thought it would help, I
would communicate my sorrows and claim your sympathy. But what does
it avail to unburden oneself? Friends will share our joys, but
every man is a solitary in his griefs. One soon finds that out! One
soon realizes the vanity of all those talks about the consolations
of philosophy and the comforts of religion, doesn't one? I suppose
even you have your moments of dejection?"</p>

<p>"One worries about things now and then. It is perfectly natural,
I daresay."</p>

<p>"Perfectly. We are not stones&mdash;least of all persons like
yourself. I would not be at your age again, not for the wealth of
Croesus! I suffered too much. All young people suffer too much;
they bear it silently, like heroes. The eye of youth dilates and
distorts the images. The focussing process is painful. Youth has no
norm. It was in one of my worst fits of despondency, I remember,
that my old teacher gave me certain advice, after I had puzzled it
out, did me some good. In fact, I have acted upon it to this very
day; I recall it as plainly as if he were speaking now. Well, I am
sorry you are leaving. I would keep you hear if I could. But I hope
you will not forget to come another day. You have cheered me up
wonderfully! Shall Andrea find you a carriage?"</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Denis.</p>

<p>"The old teacher? Let me see...He said: do not be discomposed by
the opinions of inept persons. Do not swim with the crowd. They who
are all things to their neighbours, cease to be anything to
themselves. Even a diamond can have too many facets. Avoid the
attrition of vulgar minds; keep your edges intact. He also said: A
man can protect himself with fists or sword but his best weapon is
his intellect. A weapon must be forged in the fire. The fire, in
our case, is tribulation. It must also be kept untarnished. If the
mind is clean, the body can take care of itself. He said: delve
deeply; not too deeply into the past, for it may make you
derivative; nor yet into yourself&mdash;it will make you
introspective. Delve into the living world and strive to bind
yourself to its movement by a chain of your own welding. Once that
contact is established, you are unassailable. Externalize yourself!
He told me many things of this kind. You think I was consoled by
his words? Not in the slightest degree. I was annoyed. In fact, I
thought him rather a hypocrite; anybody could have spoken as he
did! I was so disappointed that I went to him next day and told him
frankly what I thought of his counsel. He said&mdash;do you know
what he said?"</p>

<p>"I cannot even guess."</p>

<p>"He said: 'What is all wisdom save a collection of platitudes?
Take fifty of our current proverbial sayings&mdash;they are so
trite, so threadbare, that we can hardly bring our lips to utter
them. None the less they embody the concentrated experience of the
race, and the man who orders his life according to their teaching
cannot go far wrong. How easy that seems! Has any one ever done so?
Never. Has any man ever attained to inner harmony by pondering the
experiences of others? Not since the world began! He must pass
through the fire.'"</p>

<p>"I had no teacher like that," observed Denis. "He must have been
a man of the right kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, he meant well, the old rascal," replied the Count with a
curious little smile.</p>

</p>

<p>Denis descended from the Old Town. At a turn of the road he
overtook the bishop who was moving slowly in the same
direction.</p>

<p>"How is Mrs. Meadows?" enquired the young man.</p>

<p>"Not particularly well, I'm afraid. And the Count?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite all right."</p>

<p>They walked along in silence, having little to say to each
other. That visit had done Denis good; he would return soon again,
if only for the purpose of cheering up the lonely old man who, at
the last moment, had given him a photograph of the Locri Faun, with
a kindly inscription from himself. He was not to show it to
anybody, the Count had said&mdash;not yet! The government must not
hear about that relic&mdash;not yet! Later on, perhaps very soon,
everything would be in order. Denis cherished that photo in his
pocket. He was thinking, too, of the pastel&mdash;the face of
Matilda, which seemed like a star shining through the mist...Then
he remembered the bishop walking at his side. He felt he ought to
say something more to this dry Colonial whom he could not help
contrasting, greatly to his disadvantage, with the Count.</p>

<p>"Hasn't it been hot to-day?"</p>

<p>"Stifling," replied Mr. Heard. "The warmest day we have had, so
far. Not a breath of wind."</p>

<p>"Not a breath..."</p>

<p>The conversation flagged once more. They did not hit it off,
somehow; they seemed to drift further apart every time they met.
Each was preoccupied with his own thoughts. The bishop was more
taciturn than usual; the interview with his cousin had not been
quite a success.</p>

<p>Denis, after a while, made another effort. He spoke of some of
Count Caloveglia's antiquities and, one thing leading to another,
told Mr. Heard the story of a friend of his in Florence who had
excavated some wonderful early Italian pots, fragments o them, out
of an old garden well. They were all lustred, he said.</p>

<p>"That must have been a very pleasant surprise," observed the
bishop, who had small use for lustred ware and lunatics who
collected it. Feeling that it was his turn to say something, he
remarked:</p>

<p>"I am dining with the Duchess to-night. Will you be there?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the young man with an unwonted air of decision.
Never again would he be seen in that austere old convent, built by
the Good Duke Alfred. Never again! Promptly, however, he toned down
the harshness of his answer by adding that the lady had very kindly
asked him to come, but he couldn't manage it, that evening.</p>

<p>"I shall have to console her about the burglary," continued the
bishop.</p>

<p>"What burglary?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard explained that the premises had been entered while the
Duchess was dining at Madame Steynlin's on the previous evening,
the night of the water-party. Evidently the work of a man who knew
his business. A man familiar with the ins and outs of the house.
And a man of taste, into the bargain. All the sham articles had
been left untouched; he had gone off with nothing but genuine
things&mdash;a few precious crucifixes and bonbonnieres. No one had
the faintest idea who the thief was. Most mysterious! The disaster
could hardly have occurred but for the fact that the young girl
Angelina, who was supposed to sleep on the premises, had been
called away late at night to look after a suffering aunt. The old
woman, it appeared, was liable to sudden heart-attacks. She had
been round to see the Duchess early in the morning with endless
apologies, and had fortunately been able to corroborate her niece's
story.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," concluded the bishop. "Because that maid,
when I saw her, struck me as rather a flighty young
person&mdash;the sort of girl who would take advantage of her
mistress's absence to have a little flirtation with a policeman
round the corner. I am glad the aunt could explain things so
satisfactorily. I was wrong about that girl. Shows how careful one
must be in judging of other people, doesn't it? I must say she
looked to me like a regular little coquette."</p>

<p>Denis had so little sympathetic comment to make on this painful
story that Mr. Heard was quite surprised at his indifference. He
always understood the young man to be a particular friend of the
Duchess.</p>

<p>"These artistic people!" he thought. "They have quite another
way of looking at things. Dear me. I shall never live to understand
them."</p>

<p>The two separated at the market-place without much reluctance on
either side.</p>

<p>During dinner, the Duchess was calm about her misfortune. She
bore it well. She had been vigorously consoled by Don Francesco,
who pointed out that such little things are trials of faith and
that she ought to be thankful for this opportunity of proving how
little she cared for earthly riches. While not exactly thankful,
she was certainly as resigned as anybody could have been. Angelina
had already been taken into grace again, at the charitable
suggestion of the priest. Every one was puzzling who the thief
could be (it happened to be Mr. Richards); the police had not
discovered the faintest clue.</p>

<p>"It does not much matter if they do," said Don Francesco. "I
don't think, my dear lady, that you will get the judge to take up
your case very actively. You know how he hates the clericals. In
fact, I fear he will not move a finger unless the culprit also
happens to be a good believer. In that case, he might lock him up.
He is so fond of imprisoning Catholics!"</p>

<p>"A bad state of the law," commented the bishop.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Don Francesco, "And perhaps you do not know,"
he added, turning to the company, "that there has been another
robbery as well, doubtless by the same hand. Yes! I only heard of
it an hour ago. Poor Miss Wilberforce is the victim. She is
terribly upset. A number of valuables have disappeared from her
house; they must have been ransacked, she thinks, at the time of
Mr. Keith's party. I understand she was rather overcome on that
occasion. The thief seems to have been aware of her condition, and
to have profited by it."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Wilberforce!" said everybody. They were all sorry for
poor Miss Wilberforce.</p>

<p>It was a rather full dinner-party on the whole. Mr. Heard left
at half-past eleven.</p>

<p>Passing the Club on his way home, he remembered his intention of
looking in there and perhaps doing good to a few of those
fellows.</p>

<p>He climbed up the stairs. There was a fearful row going on. The
place was crammed with members of various nationalities, drinking
and arguing amid clouds of tobacco smoke. They seemed all to be at
loggerheads with one another and on the verge of breaking out into
violence, the south wind having been particularly objectionable all
day long. A good deal of filthy and profane language was being
used&mdash;it was worse than those hot places he had known in
Africa. That pink-faced old drunkard known as Charlie was the only
person who made any signs of recognizing him. He half rose from his
chair with a genial: "Hello, Bishop&mdash;" and instantly collapsed
again. Mr. Muhlen was there; he bowed rather distantly. A tremulous
pale-faced youngster invited him pressingly to a drink, and just as
the bishop was on the verge of accepting with a view to getting the
victim out of that den of vice, the lad suddenly remarked: "Excuse
me, won't you?" and tottered out of the door. They were too far
gone to be spoken to with any prospects of success. Things might
have been different if the restraining influence of Mr. Freddy
Parker could have made itself felt, but that gentleman was at home,
his lady being not very well. In the Commissioner's absence, Mr.
Richards, the respectable Vice-President, was making his voice
heard. Sober or not, he was certainly articulate and delighted with
himself as, stroking his beard placidly, he roared out above the
crowd:</p>

<p>"I've no use for makeshifts. Honesty is a makeshift. A makeshift
for saving time. Whoever wants to save time is not fit for the
society of gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>"Call yourself a gentleman?" enquired another.</p>

<p>"Just a makeshift. You won't hear honesty talked about in the
great periods of the world's history. It's the small tradesman's
invention, is honesty. He hasn't the the brains to earn anything
more than three and a half per cent. That's why he is always in
such a hurry to finish his first little deal and get on with the
next one. Else he'd starve. Hence honesty. Three and a half per
cent! Who's going to pick that up? People who earn three hundred
don't cackle about honesty."</p>

<p>"Call yourself a gentleman? Outside!"</p>

<p>"I've no use for honesty. It's the small man's flapdoodle, is
honesty. This world isn't made for small men! I am talking to you
over there&mdash;the funny little bounder who made the offensive
remark just now."</p>

<p>"Are you? Well, take that!"</p>

<p>A glass tumbler, which Mr. Richards dodged in quite a
professional manner, came hurtling through the air and missed the
bishop's forehead by about four inches.</p>

<p>That crowd was past his aid. He turned to go. As he did so, a
curious idea flitted through his brain. This Mr. Richards&mdash;was
he, perhaps, the burglar? He was; but Mr. Heard dashed aside the
horrible suspicion, mindful of the mistake he had made about
Angelina's character and how careful one must be in judging of
other people. The voice, meanwhile, pursued him down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"No, gentlemen! I've no use for an honest man. He always lets
you down. Fortunately, he is rather rare&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard slept badly that night, for the first time since his
arrival on Nepenthe. It was unbearably hot. And that visit to Mrs.
Meadows had also troubled him a little.</p>

<p>The Old Town looked different on this occasion. A sullen
death-like stillness, a menacing stagnation, hung about those pink
houses. Not a leaf was astir under the burning sirocco sky. Even
old Caterina, when he saw her, seemed to be afflicted, somehow.</p>

<p>"<i>soffre, la Signora</i>," she said. The lady was
suffering.</p>

<p>The bishop would not have recognized his cousin after all those
years; not if he had met her in the street at least. She greeted
him affectionately and they talked for a long time of family
matters. It was true, then. Her husband's leave had been again
postponed. Perhaps she would travel back to England with him, and
there await the arrival of Meadows. She would let him know
definitely in a day or two.</p>

<p>He watched her carefully while she conversed, trying to
reconstruct, out of that woman's face, the childish features he
dimly remembered. They were effaced. He could see what Keith had
meant when he described her as "tailor-made." There was something
clear-cut about her, something not exactly harsh, but savouring of
decision. She was plainly a personality&mdash;not an ordinary type.
The lines of her face told their story. They had been hammered into
a kind of hard efficiency. But over that exterior of tranquil
self-possession was super-imposed something else&mdash;certain
marks of recent trouble. Her eyes looked almost as if she had been
weeping. She made a tremendous show of cheeriness, however, calling
him Tommy as in olden days.</p>

<p>Just a little headache. This sirocco. It was bad enough when it
blew in the ordinary fashion. But quite intolerable when it hung
breathlessly about the air like this. Mr. Eames&mdash;he once
called it <i>plumbeus auster</i>. That meant leaden, didn't it?
Everybody had headaches, more or less.</p>

<p>Was she speaking the truth? The bishop decided that she had an
headache and that this south wind was certainly unendurable. None
the less, he suspected that she was employing the common
subterfuge&mdash;telling the truth, but not the whole truth;
perhaps not even the main part of it. She was holding back
something.</p>

<p>"You haven't attended to these roses lately," he said, observing
that the flowers had not been changed and that their fallen petals
strewed the tables. "They looked so fresh when I was here alone the
other day."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful person you are, Tommy, for noticing things.
First you discover my headache, and now those flowers! I see I
shall have to be careful with you. Perhaps you would like to look
at my precipice and tell me if there is anything wrong with that
too? You have heard of the old French lady, I daresay. She ended,
you know, in not approving of it at all. We can have tea when we
come back. And after that perhaps you will let me know what is
wrong with baby?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you that without looking at him. He is
teething."</p>

<p>"Clever boy! As a matter of fact, he isn't. But I had to make
some excuse to the dear Duchess."</p>

<p>They climbed up the short slope and found themselves looking
towards the sea over the face of a dizzy cliff. A falcon, on their
approach, started with rustle of wings from its ledge and then
swayed crazily over the abyss. Watching this bird, the bishop felt
a sudden voice in his stomach. A sensation of blackness came before
his eyes&mdash;sky and sea were merged together&mdash;his feet were
treading on air. He promptly sat down.</p>

<p>"Not an inch nearer!" he declared. "Not for a thousand pounds.
If you go along that edge again, I shall have to look the other
way. It makes me feel empty inside."</p>

<p>"I'm not in the least giddy," she laughed. "There was an English
boy who threw himself over this cliff for a bet&mdash;you have
heard the story? They never found his body. It's a good place for
throwing oneself down, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She seemed to consider the idea quite seriously.</p>

<p>"Well?" she pursued. "Have you any fault to find with my
precipice?"</p>

<p>"I have. It ought to be railed in. It is dangerous. What a
temptation this cliff must be to anyone who has an enemy to dispose
of! It would be so simple," he added, laughing.</p>

<p>"That advantage has never struck me before..."</p>

<p>These and other things passed through Mr. Heard's mind as he lay
in bed that evening. He came to the conclusion that he could not
quite make his cousin out. Had something upset her? And what did
she mean by that sudden conundrum:</p>

<p>"Do you know anything, Tommy, about our laws of
illegitimacy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he had replied, "except that they are a disgrace to a
civilized country. Everybody knows that."</p>

<p>She seemed to be disappointed. Perhaps she mistrusted him. The
thought gave him a little pain. He had done nothing to merit
mistrust. He was frank and open himself; he liked others to be the
same.</p>

<p>What was the use of thinking about it? He knew tantalizingly
little about his cousin&mdash;nothing but scraps of information
gathered from his mother's letters to him. He would call again in a
day or two and make some definite arrangements about their journey
to England. Perhaps he had talked more dully than usual...Or could
it be the south wind?</p>

<p>Neither of these explanations was wholly convincing.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c18.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>Nothing was happening. For the first time since many years, the
Nepenthe season threatened to be a failure. It was the dullest
spring on record. And yet there was a quality in that heavy
atmosphere which seemed to threaten mischief. Everybody agreed that
it had never been quite so bad as this. Meanwhile, people yawned.
They were bored stiff. As a source of gossip, those two burglaries
were a negligible quantity. So was the little accident which had
just happened to Mr. Keith, who ruefully declared he had done it on
purpose, in order to liven things up. No one was likely to be taken
in by this kind of talk, because the accident was of an inglorious
and even ludicrous kind.</p>

<p>Being very short-sighted he had managed to stumble backwards,
somehow or other, into a large receptacle of lime which was being
slaked for patching up a wall. Lime, in that condition, is boiling
hot. Mr. Keith's trousers were rather badly scalded. He was
sensitive on that point. He suffered a good deal. People came to
express their sympathy. The pain made him more tedious, long-winded
and exhortatory than usual. At that particular moment Denis was
being victimized. He had thoughtlessly called to express his
sympathy, to see those celebrated cannas, and because he could not
bear to be alone with his thoughts just then.</p>

<p>"Suffering!" exclaimed Mr. Keith. "That is what you young poets
want. At present you are too unperplexed and glib. Suffering! It
would enlarge your repertoire; it would make you more human,
individual, and truthful. What is the unforgivable sin in poetry?
Lack of candour. How shall there be candour if the poet lacks
worldly experience? Suffering! That is what you people want. It
would make men of you."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was considerably denser than Count Caloveglia. But
even he, during this oration, could not help noticing that it
jarred on his listener's nerves; there was something wrong, he
concluded.</p>

<p>Denis had not a word to say in reply. As if anyone could be more
suffering than himself! He was full of a dumb ache. He marvelled at
Keith's obtuseness.</p>

<p>"Come and see my cannas," said the other with a kind of brutal
tactfulness. "There is a curious story attached to them. I must
tell it to you one of these days. It sounds like a fairy tale. You
like fairy tales?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied Denis.</p>

<p>"Then we have one point in common. I could listen to them for
hours. There is something eternal about them. If you ever want to
get anything out of me, Denis, tell me a fairy tale."</p>

<p>"I must remember that," replied Denis with a wan smile. "There
is one thing I should very much like to get out of you; the secret
of your zest in life. You have so many interests. How do you manage
it?"</p>

<p>"Heredity, I suppose. It has given me a kind of violent driving
power. I take things by the throat. Have you ever heard of Thomas
Keith, a soldier in a Highland regiment, who became governor of the
Holy City of Medina? No, I suppose you have not. And yet he must
have been a remarkable man, to obtain this unique position in the
world. No interest in Arabian history? Why not? Well, Thomas
Keith&mdash;that is my stock. Pirates and adventurers. Of course I
live sensibly. Shall I give you my recipe for happiness? I find
everything useful and nothing indispensable. I find everything
wonderful and nothing miraculous. I reverence the body. I avoid
first causes like the plague. You will find that a pretty good
recipe, Denis."</p>

<p>The young man wondered whether the prescription would be of any
avail for his particular complaint.</p>

<p>Then they went into the garden, Mr. Keith hobbling painfully
with two sticks and indulging in very bad language. They paused
awhile under some trellis work covered with a profusion of Japanese
convolvuluses, pale blue, slate colour, rose-tinted, purple, deep
red, with white and coloured bands, a marvellous display of fragile
beauty.</p>

<p>"I have never seen anything like it!" declared Denis.</p>

<p>"They die away in winter. I get fresh seeds every year from
Japan, the latest varieties. How they cling for support to the
wooden framework! How delicate and fair! One hardly dares to touch
them. Are you always going to be a convolvulus, Denis?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I see what you mean. Were you never a convolvulus, Mr.
Keith?"</p>

<p>His friend laughed.</p>

<p>"It must have been a good while ago. You don't like advice, do
you? Have you ever heard of that Sparker affair?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. That was me. That was my little contribution to the gaiety
of University life. So you see I am in the position to give advice
to people like yourself. I think you should cultivate the function
of the real, and try to remain in contact with phenomena. Noumena
are bad for a youngster. But perhaps you are not interested in
psychology?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, I'm afraid," replied Denis, who was more anxious
to see those cannas.</p>

<p>"So I perceive. Wouldn't you get more fun out of life if you
were? I am nearly done with psychology now," he added. "It was the
Greek philosophers before then. When I take up a subject this is
what I do. I don't ask what are Aristotle's teachings or relations
to his age or to humanity. That would lead me too far. I ask
myself: what has this fellow got to say to me? To me, you
understand. To me."</p>

<p>"That must simplify matters."</p>

<p>"It does," replied Keith, quite unaware of the faint tinge of
College irony in the other's words. "Direct experience comes only
from life. But you can get a kind of substitute out of books.
Perhaps you are afraid of them? Take the fellows by the throat! See
what they have to say. Make them disgorge. Get at their facts. Pull
them to pieces. I tell you what, Denis. You must go through a
course of Samuel Butler. You are moving in the same direction;
perhaps he may be a warning to you. I took him up, I remember,
during my biological period. He was exactly like
yourself&mdash;bewildered by phenomena."</p>

<p>Denis, meekly resigned, enquired:</p>

<p>"Was he?"</p>

<p>"I spent nearly a week over Butler. I found him interesting not
for what he writes, but for what he is. A landmark. Think of when
he wrote. It was an age of giants&mdash;Darwin and the rest of
them. Their facts were too much for him; they impinged on some
obscure old prejudices of his. They drove him into a clever
perversity of humour. They account for his cat-like touches, his
contrariness, his fondness for scoring off everybody from the Deity
downwards, his premeditated irresponsibilities, his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he not prove that the Odyssey was written by a woman?"</p>

<p>"He did. Anything to escape from realities&mdash;that was his
maxim. He puzzled his contemporaries. But we can now locate him
with absolute certainty. He personifies the Revolt from Reason.
<i>Surtout, mon ami, point de zle</i>. He talks about the Scylla
of Atheism and the Charybdis of Christianity&mdash;a state of mind
which, by the way, is not conducive to bold navigation. He was
always wavering between the two in an attitude of suburban
defiance, reconciling what is irreconcilable by extracting funny
analogies all round for the edification of "nice people" like
himself. Oh, very English! He did not lack candour or intelligence.
Nor do you. He understood the teachings of the giants. So do you.
But they irked him. To revenge himself he laid penny crackers under
their pedestals. His whole intellectual fortune was spent in buying
penny crackers. There was something cheeky and pre-adolescent about
him&mdash;a kind of virginal ferocity. That iridescent charm of
sexlessness which somebody, one of these days, must be good enough
to analyse for us! He lacked the male attributes of humility,
reverence and sense of proportion."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith paused, but it was only to take breath.</p>

<p>"Did he?" enquired Denis. "The sense of proportion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tail of a cow was just as important to him as the tail of a
comet; more important, if it could be turned into a joke. Look at
the back of his mind and you will always see the same thing: horror
of a fact. That is what lies before you, Denis, if, in a world of
facts, you refuse to assimilate them. They will disagree with you,
as they disagreed with Butler. They will drive you where they drove
him&mdash;into abstractions. Others went the same way. The painter
Watts, for instance. He also suffered under the reign of giants. He
also took refuge in abstractions. Faith leading Hope towards
Despair. Why don't you write a book about these things, Denis?"</p>

<p>"I am going to be an artist."</p>

<p>"An Artist? That is better than a poet. Verse-making is a little
out of date, is it not? It corresponds to juvenile stages of human
development. Poets are a case of genepistasis. If they would at
least get a new stock of ideas! Their demonology is so hopelessly
threadbare. But why an artist? I think you were made for a bank
manager, Denis. Don't look so surprised. Everybody grows up, you
know. Shelley, if he had lived long enough, would have become a
passable gentleman farmer. You can take my word for that."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"Don't take Mr. Keith's word for anything!" said a voice behind
his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was Don Francesco, who had come upon them unawares. He now
removed his hat and began to mop his forehead and various double
chins with a many-tinted handkerchief as large as a tablecloth.</p>

<p>"My dear Don Francesco!" said Keith. "You always interrupt me in
the middle of my sermons. What shall we do with you?"</p>

<p>"Give me something to drink," replied the priest. "Else I shall
evaporate, leaving nothing but a grease stain on this beautiful
garden path."</p>

<p>"To evaporate," said Keith, with a tinge of sadness in his
voice. "What an ideal resolution!"</p>

<p>"I'll get some wine out of the house," suggested Denis politely.
"But first of all tell me this. Mr. Keith has been giving me his
recipe for happiness. What is yours?"</p>

<p>"Happiness is a question of age. The bachelor of forty&mdash;he
is the happy man."</p>

<p>"That does not help me much," said Denis. "But I'll get your
wine, all the same."</p>

<p>He went.</p>

<p>"A nice young fellow," observed the priest. "This little
accident of yours," he continued, "does not reflect itself on your
face. You always look like a baby, Keith. What is your secret? I
believe you have concluded a pact with the devil for your
soul."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Don Francesco, he never made me an offer
for it."</p>

<p>"Sensible devil! He knows he will get it sooner or later for
nothing."</p>

<p class="caption">Keith, Denis and Don Francesco</p>

<p>They conversed awhile till Denis returned, bearing sundry
bottles and glasses on a tray. The priest smiled at the sight.
Light-hearted allusions to Ganymede rose to his lips, but were
suppressed. He swallowed down the rising inclination to be
classical at the expense of good taste, and engulfed, on the top of
it, as a kind of paperweight, a vast tumblerful of red Nepenthe
wine. The draught instead of cheering seemed to make him suddenly
despondent. He wiped his lips and remarked, in a grave and almost
conscience-stricken manner:</p>

<p>"I have some unpleasant news for you, gentlemen. The fountain of
Saint Elias has ceased to flow. We heard it this morning from a
sailor, an unusually trustworthy person&mdash;a man, I mean, who
can be relied upon to tell the truth when there is nothing to be
gained by concealing or distorting it. The thing must have happened
last night. Yes, it has dried up altogether. What is to be
done?"</p>

<p>"You don't say so," remarked Keith. "This is really interesting!
I thought something was going to happen. I suppose your people are
rather alarmed?"</p>

<p>Denis interrupted:</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you are talking about. Why should not a
fountain dry up if it wants to? And what does it matter to
anybody?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" echoed the priest. "This is no ordinary
fountain, I am sorry to say. Have you never heard of
Beelzebub?"</p>

</p>

<p>Now, with regard to fountains, it is to be noted that Nepenthe,
an islet of volcanic stone rising out of the blue Mediterranean,
has never&mdash;for all its natural attractions&mdash;been renowned
for cool springs and bubbling streamlets. There is, to be sure, a
charming couplet in some old humanist about <i>lympha Nepenthi</i>;
but modern scholars are disposed to think either that the text is
corrupt and that the writer was picturing an imaginary
<i>nympha</i>&mdash;some laughing sea-lady&mdash;or else that he
merely indulged in one of those poetic flights which are a feature
of the literature of his period. For whatever the cause may
be&mdash;whether internal fires have scorched up the natural
humours of the soil, or whether the waters of Nepenthe are of such
peculiar heaviness that, instead of flowing upwards in the shape of
fountains, they tumble downwards into caverns below the
sea&mdash;the fact remains: Nepenthe is a waterless land. And this
may well be the reason, as several thoughtful observers have
already pointed out, why its wines are so abundant in quantity, so
cheap in price, and of such super-excellent flavour. For it is a
fact conformable to that law of compensation which regulates all
earthly affairs, a fact borne out by the universal experience of
mankind, that God, when He takes away with one hand, gives with the
other. Lack of water, on the face of things, might be deemed a
considerable hardship. There are tracts in Africa where people have
been known to barter wives and children for a cupful of the liquid
element. Of the inhabitants of Nepenthe it must be said to their
credit that they endure their lot with equanimity, and even
cheerfulness. Their wine costs nothing. Why grumble at the
inscrutable ways of Providence? Why be thirsty, why be sober, when
you can get as drunk as a lord for the asking?</p>

<p>For the rest, there are indications to show that such was not
the original condition of affairs on the island. On the contrary,
certain legends still current among the country-folk lead one to
suspect that fountains once flowed on this arid rock. And more than
legends. Monsignor Perrelli, in his <i>Antiquities of Nepenthe</i>,
has gone into the subject with his usual thoroughness. The reader
who takes the trouble to consult that work will find, in the
twenty-sixth chapter of the third section dealing with the Natural
Productions and Water-Supply of the island, an enumeration of no
less than twelve fountains still flowing during the author's
lifetime. Some of them issued high up, in rocky clefts; others at
the middle heights, among vineyards and orchards; the majority at,
or near, the seashore. All of these springs, he tells us, had the
following features in common: they were more or less hot,
unpleasant to the taste, of foetid odour and therefore unfit for
culinary or other common uses. "But let it not be supposed," he
hastens to add, "that they were worthless, inasmuch as there is no
such thing as a worthless gift of Providence. Whoever argues on
such fallacious lines," he says, "will stand convicted both of
folly and of irreverence, seeing that it is the business of
mankind, when confronted by a phenomenon which seems to mock their
intelligence, humbly to ponder the evidence&mdash;to investigate
causes and ascertain results." In the present case the utility of
the waters, if not for cooking or drinking then for other specific
purposes, had been put to the proof time out of mind, in an
empirical fashion; though it was not till the reign of the Good
Duke Alfred that a series of classical experiments placed our
knowledge of their medicinal properties on a sound scientific
footing.</p>

<p>In a dissertation attached to this twenty-sixth chapter&mdash;a
dissertation larded with illustrative extracts from Galen Celsus,
Avicenna, Antonius Musa, Oribasius Salvus and about fifty others of
the ancients who professed the healing art&mdash;Monsignor Perrelli
condenses for his readers the results of these classical
experiments; he hands down the names of these springs and their
manifold healing virtues.</p>

<p>The Fountain of Saint Calogero, described as one of the most
famous, was lukewarm, of ammoniacal and alkaline flavour; a
glassful of it produced the most violent retchings and vomitings.
Properly applied, however, the water had been found to relieve the
gout, the discomforts of child-bearing, leprosy, irritation of the
mucous membrane of the nose, impetigo, strabismus and ophthalmia.
If the patient observed care in his diet, avoiding articles of
calorific nature such as fried fish and boiled lentils, he would
find himself greatly benefited by its use in the case of cornucopic
hydrocephalus, flatulence, tympanitis and varicose veins. It was
useful, furthermore, as a cure for the stings of scorpions and
other venomous beasts.</p>

<p>The so-called "Fountain of Paradise," of nitrous ingredients,
spurted forth with a prodigious hissing noise at a temperature of
boiling lead, from so inaccessible a fissure in the rocks that
little had been done to investigate its peculiar properties. It was
held none the less to be efficacious for the distemper known as
<i>plica polonica</i>, and the peasant folk, mixing its spray with
the acorns on which their pigs were fattened, had observed that
these quadrupeds prospered vastly in health and appearance.</p>

<p>The Fountain of Hercules, laxative and tartaric, had proved its
efficacy in cases of enlarged spleen, hare-lip, vertigo, apoplexy,
cachexia, cacodoria, cacochymia senilis and chilblains. It was also
considered to be a sovereign remedy for that distressing and almost
universal complaint, the piles.</p>

<p>The Fountain known as "La Salina," of arsenical nature, was
frequented chiefly by women who found in its waters an alleviation
for troubles which Monsignor Perrelli does not specify. It was
recommended, moreover, as a sheep-dip.</p>

<p>The Fountain of the Virgin, purgative and blastopeptic, had
given relief to sufferers from the quartan fever, herpes,
elephantiasis, and to all persons of atrobiliary and lunatick
temperament.</p>

<p>The so-called "Old Fountain," of sub-acidulate and vitriolique
flavour, chalybeate and cataplastic, was renowned for removing
stains from household linen. Taken in minute doses, under medical
advice, it gave relief to patients afflicted with the wolfe,
<i>noli me tangere</i>, crudities, Bablyonian itch, globular
pemphlegema, fantastical visions, koliks, asthma and affections of
the heart. It also "fortifies the stomach, comforts the bowels,
reduces the gallstone to sand, the sand to mud, the mud to
water&mdash;water which can be passed out of the system by the
usual channels."</p>

<p>The Fountain of Saint Vulcan, anti-blepharous and amygdaloidal,
was charged with such potent minerals that a single spoonful
produced a diarrhoea more distressing to witness than cholera. None
the less, applied externally, it was a wondrous remedy in cases of
jaundice, toothache and open wounds.</p>

<p>The Fountain of the Capon, sedative and scorbutic, was indicated
for rheumatisms of every kind, not excluding sprained limbs,
hydrophobia, lycanthropy, black choler, oppilations and
procrastinating catapepsia.</p>

<p>The Fountain known as "Spina Santa" was resorted to by all
persons suffering from maladies of the alimentary canal, such as
dysentery, cloven palate, follicular hepatitis, and trabulated
hyperaemia of the Bivonian passage.</p>

<p>The Fountain of Saint Feto had, by virtue of its smell alone,
applied to her nose as she lay in her coffin, raised from the dead
a certain Anna da Pasto.</p>

<p>The Fountain popularly called "La Pisciarella" was peculiarly
adapted to those ailments which are incidental to childhood and
youth&mdash;to wit: chlorosis, St. Vitus' Dance, constipation,
ringworm, otootitis and other perimingeal disturbances, urticaria,
moon-sickness, scrofula and incontinence of urine.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Fountain of Saint Elias, sulphurous and saponaceous,
was renowned for its calming influence upon all who suffered from
abuse of lechery or alcohol, or from ingrowing toe-nails.</p>

<p>This concludes the list.</p>

<p>"Whence we may safely infer," says Monsignor Perrelli at the
termination of this chapter, "that our island is second to no part
of the globe in this divine gift of salutary waters. And if some
should ask why certain of these springs have recently undergone a
marked diminution in volume we can but answer, simply and
truthfully, that their virtues are no longer in as great demand as
formerly. For is it not a fact that distempers like leprosy and
<i>plica polonica</i> are now almost unknown on Nepenthe? It
follows that the waters adapted to maladies such as these have
performed their appointed task, so far as this island is concerned.
They are doubtless flowing elsewhere, through mysterious channels
of the earth, to carry their health-giving virtues into fresh
regions for the saving of men's lives, to the glory of their
Creator."</p>

<p>Thus far the learned and ingenious Monsignor Perrelli...</p>

<p>It stands to reason that so remarkable a chapter should not have
escaped the notice of the bibliographer who, as already observed,
had been engaged for the last quarter of a century in elucidating
the text of the old historian and enriching it with footnotes for
the better understanding of modern students. In the interval of
three and a half centuries many changes had taken place in the
physical aspect of Nepenthe; among other things, these twelve
streams of pestilential odour had ceased to flow, all save the
fountain of Saint Elias; their very sites had been forgotten,
though traditions of their former existence still lingered among
the populace.</p>

<p>Searching among the archives for whatever might bear on the
ancient history of these springs, Mr. Eames had accumulated
abundant material for footnotes geological, hydrographical and
balneo-therapic. Furthermore, his personal explorations on the
island had enabled him to locate the site of at least four of these
old fountains, and to prove that if some of them had been covered
up under the debris of landslides, the majority had disappeared in
consequence of a general desiccation of the province.</p>

<p>Lastly and chiefly, his investigations had brought him in
contact with that manuscript, already mentioned, of the Dominican
monk Father Capocchio-a manuscript in which he alighted upon a
curious but troublesome literary discovery anent these very
fountains. The author, a contemporary of Monsignor Perrelli, a
hater of Nepenthe, a cleric of lascivious and lecherous
temperament, has in this parchment preserved what he calls a
"popular joke"&mdash;a saying which he declares to have been
"common property of the whole country" on the subject of Nepenthe
and its evil-smelling waters. It was one of those scholarly,
ponderous and yet helplessly straightforward jokes of the late
Renaissance; a joke to which Monsignor Perrelli does not allude,
both for reasons of local patriotism and of general decorum; some
vulgar dictum, in short, connected with the name of the patron
saint of Nepenthe who, he urged, was simply a local nature-god,
christianized.</p>

<p>When the bibliographer's eagle eye first fell upon this passage
he was staggered. Then, on reflection, he found himself in an
awkward predicament&mdash;his natural modesty as a man contending
with a no less natural and legitimate pride and desire as historian
that the fruits of his labours should not be lost.</p>

<p>"These," he said, "are the dilemmas which confront the
conscientious annotator."</p>

<p>What position was he to take up? Should he exclude the miserable
joke altogether from his amended and enlarged edition of Perrelli?
He did not feel himself justified in this line of conduct. Some
future investigator would be sure to unearth it and get the credit
for his industry. Should he re-state it in such terms as to make it
palatable to refined readers, diluting its primary pungency without
impairing its essential signification? He was disposed to adopt
that course, but, unfortunately, all attempts at verbal
manipulation failed. Good scholar as Mr. Eames was, the joke proved
to be obdurate, uncompromising; vainly he wrestled with it; try as
he would, it stood out naked and unashamed, refusing to be either
cajoled or bullied into respectability. There was no circumventing
that joke, he decided. Should he reproduce it therefore <i>in
extenso</i>? Such, after mature deliberation and not without
certain moral misgivings, he conceived to be his duty towards
posterity. Veiled in the obscurity of a learned tongue, the joke
was surreptitiously introduced into the company of a thousand
chaste footnotes that could dispense with such covering
devices.</p>

<p>Of the subsequent history of the Saint Elias Fountain, which
alone still continued to flow, the bibliographer also learned
much&mdash;how its fame had grown in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries till it attracted invalids from the most distant
provinces, necessitating the erection of a palatial pump-room for
the better accommodations of visitors; how latterly again the
waters had unaccountably fallen into disfavour with the public. And
this, notwithstanding the fact that in 1872 the celebrated Privy
Councillor Dr. Saponaro, Director of the Montecitorio Home for
Incurables, had written, at the urgent solicitation of the Nepenthe
Town Authorities (who were alarmed at the decrease in their
bathing-tax revenue) a pamphlet&mdash;a pamphlet which, by the way,
cost them a mint of money in view of the author's deserved
reputation as an incorruptible scientist&mdash;a pamphlet extolling
the virtue of the spring; proving, by elaborate chemical analysis,
that its ingredients had not only not changed a white since the
days of Monsignor Perrelli but actually improved in quality; and
concluding with the warm recommendation that they were as well
adapted as ever for curing those ailments to which the island
population was peculiarly liable&mdash;namely, the consequences of
excessive lechery and alcohol, and the discomfort caused by
ingrowing toe-nails.</p>

<p>The local deputy, Don Guistino Morena, had often promised his
Nepenthean constituents to look into the matter and see that
something was done. But he was a busy man. Up to the present he had
apparently not moved a finger.</p>

<p>And now this fountain, the last survivor of the twelve
health-giving springs, had suddenly run dry...</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V1-c20.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>The bad news spread like wild-fire. It was regarded&mdash;for
reasons which will presently appear&mdash;as a portent of gravest
significance. The clergy met in unofficial but well-attended
conclave to deliberate as to what attitude should be adopted
towards the phenomenon, and what measures taken to allay popular
apprehensions.</p>

<p>There was gossip, too, at the Club. Most of its members were of
the <i>laissez faire</i> or even rationalistic type, and one of
them&mdash;an unobtrusive Hindu who was suspected of wearing
stays&mdash;went so far in his indifference as to declare that the
only result of the drying-up of the fountain would be "one smell
less on Nepenthe." A small but compact minority, however, thought
otherwise. Obsessed by vague forebodings, they found an able and
eloquent interpreter of their fears in the Commissioner who, rather
redder in the face than usual, strode fussily up and down the
premises, tugging at his disreputable briar pipe, drinking the
whisky with anybody who cared to pay for it, and declaring to all
and sundry that something must be done. It was his
panacea&mdash;his unvarying formula for every emergency, scandalous
or otherwise. Something must be done, he avowed. And from the
card-table came two approving echoes&mdash;the voices of Mr. Muhlen
and Signor Malipizzo, who did not care tuppence about the fountain
but never lost an opportunity of expressing their public approval
of Mr. Parker's words and actions.</p>

<p>Something must be done and that soon, for in a few brief hours
an atmosphere of gloom, a sense of impending calamity, had begun to
hover over the sunny island. The natives called to mind, with
consternation, that only once within the memory of their ancestors
had the fountain behaved after this fashion. It was on the eve of
that great volcanic outbreak on the mainland which, by a deadly
shower of ashes, destroyed their crops and impoverished them to
such an extent that for three consecutive months they could barely
afford the most unnecessary luxuries of life. They opined with some
show of reason that the little streamlet had been tempted by
ancient and obscure bonds to sympathy to forsake its old home and
creep away, under leagues of shimmering sea, towards the fiery
heart of the volcano; there to undergo some alchemic process of
readjustment, some ordeal, some torrid nuptial rite which would
result in the birth of a flaming monster and the ruin of
mankind.</p>

<p>The terrace was crowded with folk; all eyes were turned toward
the distant fire-mountain. But the volcano had never looked so
placid, so harmless, so attractive; its shapely flanks suffused
with the crimson light of evening, while wreaths of violent vapour
ascended, in lazy intermittent spirals, from the cone. They rose
into the zenith playfully, one after the other, as though the
volcano were desirous of drawing attention to its pretty manners,
and were wafted onwards, in delicate wisps of smoke by the
persistent South wind. The clergy now began to appear in goodly
numbers upon the scene. They were in the best of humours and more
ready than usual, it seemed, to take part in any conversation which
might be going on. It had been decided, during their informal
gathering, that the apprehensions of the faithful could not be
better allayed at this preliminary stage than by a mild
demonstration of this kind. Appearances were everything; so they
had concluded, not for the first time. And it was precisely then
that the simple-minded <i>parroco</i>, surrounded by a knot of
devout believers, pointed to the playful cloudlets of smoke as they
issued from the mouth of the crater and apposite, but calculated to
calm the minds of his hearers. He said that no rosy schoolboy,
smoking his first cigarette, ever looked more innocent. An ominous,
fateful speech! Yet such was his holy simplicity that he failed to
realize its import. He failed to perceive how inauspicious the
metaphor had been till Don Francesco, in a whisper, pointed out
that appearances are apt to be deceptive and, alluding to certain
experiences of his own at the tender age of six years, affirmed
that the smoking of a first cigarette, for all its seeming
harmlessness, is liable to be followed by something in the nature
of a cataclysm.</p>

<p>There was worse to come. For while the sun yet lingered on the
horizon news of further portents came thick and fast. A plum tree
belonging to a farmer of good standing had unaccountably lost all
its leaves. The Duchess arrived in a state of unusual trepidation,
declaring that the tortoise-shell of her lorgnette gave forth a
crackling sound. She appealed to Don Francesco to explain the
meaning of this extraordinary circumstance; it crackled most
distinctly, she declared. Not far from the little bay where only
yesterday the streamlet of Saint Elias still trickled into the sea,
a fisherman had caught a one-eyed lamprey&mdash;a beast,
unquestionably, of ill repute. The bibliographer, strolling about
with Denis, recollected that his fox-terrier that very morning had
been violently sick. He seemed to attach no great importance to the
affair; all the same, he said, it was rather queer; dogs are not
like that; now, if it had been Keith...The baby of the principal
grocer had tumbled downstairs and thereupon proceeded to swallow
eight of its elder brother's marbles which had been carelessly left
on the floor&mdash;without experiencing, so far as could be
ascertained, any appreciable injury. A mysterious disease, known as
the scabies, had broken out among the Russian apostles. The yacht
of the American millionaire, Mr. van Koppen, arrived that day;
there was nothing startling in this since he visited the island
year after year at the same season; but why should she collide with
a fishing-boat at the moment of anchoring?</p>

<p>And from the Old Town came news of a portentous fowl which had
suddenly assumed the plumage of the male sex. It was a hen
renowned, hitherto, for her temperate and normal habits and, as it
happened, known by sight to the local parish priest, who, horrified
at the transformation of the feathered monster and mindful of the
Papal Bull <i>ne nimis noceant nobis</i> which enjoins upon
Christians the duty of destroying all unnatural productions however
generated, incontinently ordered it to be put out of the way. But
the destruction of this androgyne proved an arduous task. It was
reported that the creature fought for its life with the energy of a
demon, crowing vigorously the while and laying, in the very act of
death, an egg&mdash;an egg of spheroidal form, bluish in colour,
and apparently hard-boiled&mdash;an egg which the Chief Medical
Officer of Health had no great difficulty in recognizing as that of
a cockatrice.</p>

<p>In view of these and other sinister occurrences it is not
surprising that a sense of insecurity should have fallen upon the
more credulous section of the natives. Even sceptical persons
thought it rather provoking on the part of Providence, or whoever
managed these things, that the disquieting of men's minds should
take place during this particular fortnight, the most important of
the whole year, midway between the great feasts of Saint Dodekanus
and Saint Eulalia when the island was crammed with visitors.</p>

<p>And there followed late at night yet another surprise. Mr.
Parker had been called away from his duties at the Club in hot
haste by the news that his lady was seriously ill. A few days
earlier she had been stung on the lip by a mosquito; no further
attention was paid to the incident, though the disagreeable south
wind provoked a rise in temperature and some discomfort. On this
afternoon, however, her face had suddenly begun to assume strange
tints and to swell in wondrous fashion. It was no already enlarged
to twice its natural size and altogether&mdash;in the words of the
physician who had been summoned to her villa&mdash;"a thing to
see."</p>

<p>It had always been a thing to see. So, at least, said those who
were privileged to know. There were tropical strains in her
blood-strains from some flowery land in the Caribbean Sea-strains
which refused to mingle in harmonious fashion with the white
elements in her ancestry. She was neither lovely nor lovable, and
it was regarded as a kindly dispensation of Heaven that some
malformation of the lower limbs kept her confined to her boudoir,
where no visitors ever called save a few misguided newcomers to the
island who were unaware of her idiosyncrasies. These
idiosyncrasies, due to the enforced inactivity of her feet, took
the form of a grotesque activity of the tongue. Her infirmity
preventing her from learning how things really stood, she let her
phantasy run riot on the occasional reports which reached the
villa; and that phantasy, nourished by lack of physical exercise,
indulged in a love of scandal-mongering which bordered, and
sometimes trespassed, on the pathological. She distilled scandal
from every pore, and in such liberal quantities that even the
smiling and good-natured Don Francesco once spoke of her as "the
serpent in the Paradise." But perhaps he only said that because
Madame Parker was not over-fond of him&mdash;his rival the
<i>parroco</i> being her friend and confessor.</p>

<p>Such being the case, the prospect of her possible demise was
received with unconcern and even relief by all save a notable
number of tradesmen who prayed fervently for her health because the
lady, presuming on her connection with the official representative
of the friendly state of Nicaragua, had contrived to owe them
considerable sums of money. Knowing the Commissioner as they did,
these victims feared that they would never be able to collect their
due in the event of her death. Hence their prayers for her speedy
recovery.</p>

<p>What would that gentleman do without her? For it was his
redeeming feature that he felt, or professed to feel, affection for
this graceless harridan who was the only person on earth that
believed, or professed to believe, in the integrity of his motives.
It is to be presumed that they saw through each other perfectly;
she, at least, may well have appraised him at his true value. She
must have known him for a dishonest fool. Yet this principle of
mutual attachment was never relinquished. Wiser than her
stepbrother, she knew that a house divided against itself must
fall; she therefore approved, forcefully if without conviction, of
his every word and deed. Such approval did him good. It created a
fictitious self-esteem. And this was really rather unfortunate,
since self-esteem, by giving him a sense of importance and
consequence in the world, rendered him a good deal more
objectionable to his fellow-creatures than he need have been.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she lingered on, and a small group of enquirers were
gathered round the physician who was returning late at night from
his third visit. The moralists among them saw the finger of God in
the fact that her mouth, out of which had proceeded so much harm to
strong men and women, should now be sealed by one of the frailest
of His creatures. The doctor shrugged his shoulders at this kind of
talk. He was no moralizer; he was a true Southerner, an
aesthete&mdash;one of those who could appreciate the subtlest
beauty of a skin disease. He waxed discursive on the subject; said
that the lady's face reminded him of the rainbow in a certain
picture by a local genius; avowed that there were moments when even
a doctor's hard life had its compensations, and that this was one
of them.</p>

<p>His enthusiasm carried the audience off their feet. It converted
the sternest preachers into artists. They forgot to talk about
moral lessons. All congratulated the good Aesculapius on his choice
of the medical profession as a career and his luck in beholding a
spectacle such as this; especially when he added, with glowing
eloquence, that it was astonishing how so small an insect, a mere
mosquito, should be able to produce an eruption of this magnitude
and in colours, moreover, which would have made Titian or Peter
Paul Rubens burst with envy.</p>

</p>

<p>Decidedly, things were happening, as Mr. Heard would have
said.</p>

<p>Strange to say that gentleman himself was probably the only
person on Nepenthe who still remained in ignorance of all these
praeternatural occurrences. In the early morning, after admiring
the sea overhung by a cloudless sky and once more thanking the
Duchess in his heart for such a delightful residence when he might
have been boxed up in some stuffy hotel bedroom, he descended to
the beach for his morning bathe. Such was his custom. The swim did
him good, it freshened him up.</p>

<p>Then back to breakfast and a busy morning's work, to settle up
arrears of correspondence. He wrote to various friends in England;
he wrote a long letter&mdash;the third since his arrival&mdash;to
his mother, telling her of all such things as might interest her; a
nice gossipy letter, full of information about the entertainments
of the foreigners on Nepenthe, about the obliging natives, the
Russian colony, the persistent sirocco, his own domestic life, his
improved health. Much as he liked the place and people, he said, he
expected to be leaving in a week or so. He concluded with two pages
describing his last visit to his cousin. She was rather poorly or
troubled in mind, he thought; he would see her again ere long.</p>

<p>And that reminded him&mdash;he would write to Mrs. Meadows as
well. He did so, enquiring after her health, asking whether he
could be of any assistance, and promising to call again shortly.
"Rather a formal epistle," he concluded, on reading it through. He
was unable to force the note: he could never write or talk
otherwise than he felt, and this cousin, after all, was rather
remote, self-centred, and difficult of comprehension. "It must go
as it is," he decided. "To be quite frank, she's not exactly
encouraging either. Asks such queer questions. What on earth did
she mean by that conundrum about illegitimacy, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Then luncheon; then a long sleep till tea-time. Everyone slept
at this hour during the days of sirocco-heat. What else was there
to do? He had already learned to look forward to that calm
post-prandial hour of slumber. One owes something to oneself,
<i>n'est ce pas</i>? as Muhlen had said.</p>

<p>On waking he bethought him of an invitation to tea with Madame
Steynlin. He would have listened gladly to her music and her
instructive and charitable talk about Nepenthe and its inhabitants.
But he was afraid of meeting Russians there. The lady seemed to be
specializing in Muscovites just then, and Mr. Heard was not in the
Russian mood. He would take what he called "a day off" from social
duties.</p>

<p>Slipping his field glasses into his pocket, he rambled upwards
by now familiar paths, past white farmhouses nestling in a riot of
greenery; till he reached the barer regions. The vines were more
sparsely cultivated here, and soon all trace of human handcraft was
at an end. He found himself on a little plateau of volcanic cinders
and lava-blocks. The spare grasses and flowers that grew between
fuliginous masses of stone were already losing their bright enamel
under the withering heat; a peculiar odour, acrid but stimulating
to the nostrils, rose from the parched ground. Here he rested
awhile. He scanned the landscape through his glasses&mdash;a
wine-coloured sea at his feet, flecked with sailing boats
innumerable; confronting him from the volcano whose playful antics
were even then attracting the attention of a crowded Piazza. And
his eye roved along the serrated contours of the mainland, its
undulating shore-line, its distant peaks throbbing in the sunset
glow; they rested upon many villages, coral-tinted specks of light,
so far away they seemed to belong to another world. It was a
pleasure to breathe on these aerial heights, surrounded by sky and
sea; to survey the world as a bird might survey it. Like floating
in air...</p>

<p>He sat and smoked and pondered. He tried to get himself into
perspective. "I must straighten myself out," he thought. Assuredly
it was a restful place, this Nepenthe, abounding in kindly people;
his affection for it grew with every day. Rest without; but where
was that old rest within, that sense of plain tasks plainly to be
performed, of tangible duty? Whither had it gone? Alien influences
were at work upon him. Something new had insinuated itself into his
blood, some demon of doubt and disquiet which threatened his
old-established conceptions. Whence came it? The effect of changed
environment&mdash;new friends, new food, new habits? The
unaccustomed leisure which gave him, for the first time, a chance
of thinking about non-professional matters? The south wind acting
on his still weakened health? All these together? Or had he reached
an epoch in his development, the termination of one of those
definite life&mdash;periods when all men worthy of the name pass
through some cleansing process of spiritual desquamation, and slip
their outworn weeds of thought and feeling?</p>

<p>Whatever it was he seemed to be no longer his own master, as in
former days. Fate had caused his feet to stray towards something
new&mdash;something alarming. He was poised, as it were, on the
brink of a gulf. Or rather, it was as if that old mind of his, like
a boat sailing hitherto briskly before the wind, had suddenly
encountered a bank of calm, of utter and ominous calm; it was a
thing spell-bound; a toy of circumstances beyond human control. The
canvas hung in the stagnant air. From which quarter would the
quickening breeze arrive? Whither would it bring him?</p>

<p>And his glance fell upon a slender coquettish vessel, a
new-comer, lying in the sunny harbour under the cliff. He knew it
from hearsay. It was the <i>Flutterby</i>, van Koppen's yacht. He
recollected all he had ever heard about the millionaire; he tried
to conjure up some idea of his features and habits from gossip
overheard at odd moments.</p>

<p>This man, he concluded, must be intelligent beyond ordinary
standards. It would be worth while making his acquaintance. America
is notoriously the land of youthful precocity. But it is not every
American who, as a stripling of fourteen summers, puzzling in
callow boyish perplexity upon the thousand ills that afflict
mankind and burning with desire for their betterment, makes a
discovery in Malthusian methods destined to convulse the trade and
the social life of a continent. Not everybody is like young
Koppen&mdash;he attached a van to his name on reaching his
seventy-fifth million&mdash;who, possessed at that time of barely
three dollars in the world and not even the shadow of a moustache,
had both the wit to realize the hygienic importance of a certain
type of goods and the pertinacity to insist on cheapening their
price, in the interest of public health, to such an extent
that&mdash;to quote from subsequent advertisements&mdash;they
should be "within reach of the humblest home." It is not
everybody&mdash;no, not every American&mdash;who, after
revolutionizing the technique of manufacture and shattering the
Paris monopoly, dares boldly to advertise the improved article
across the length and breadth of the land, and to thrust his
commodity upon a reluctant market in the teeth of popular prejudice
and commercial rivalry. Van Koppen had done all this. And it was
noted that he had done it without ever for a moment losing sight of
his dual aim&mdash;mercantile and philanthropic; for if he was a
humanitarian by natural disposition, he became what he called "a
tradesman by force of circumstance"&mdash;and not a bad tradesman,
either. He had done all this and more. Unlike most self-made men
who remain yoked like oxen to their sordid affairs (in harness,
they aptly call it) he had been shrewd enough to retire from
business in the heyday of his age, on a relatively modest
competence of fifteen million dollars a year. He was spending his
time at present in the gratification of personal whims, and leaving
the remaining millions to be picked up by whoever cared to take the
trouble. Manifestly an unusual type of millionaire&mdash;this man
who had lived down half a century of obloquy and was now hailed, in
well-informed circles, as the saviour of his country.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Van Koppen was described as a brisk, genial,
talkative old fellow, rather fat, with a clear complexion, sound
teeth, shrubby grey beard, a twang barely sufficient to
authenticate his transatlantic descent, and the digestion of a
boa-constrictor. He was tremendously fond of buttered
tea-cakes&mdash;so the Duchess said; a man who, in the words of
Madame Steynlin, "really appreciated good music" and who, as the
<i>parroco</i> never ceased to declare, could be relied on to give
a handsome contribution towards the funds for supporting the poor
and repairing a decrepit parish organ. (The parish poor were never
in such dire distress, the parish organ never so hopelessly
deranged, as during that annual week when the <i>Flutterby</i> rode
at anchor.)</p>

<p>In fact there was no doubt about it: van Koppen had the gifts of
making himself beloved. But nobody's company was more markedly to
his taste than that of Count Caloveglia. The two old men spent
hours together in Caloveglia's shady courtyard, eating candied
fruits, sipping home-made liqueurs of peaches or mountain-herbs and
talking&mdash;ever talking. Between them there existed some strong
and strange bond of friendship or interest. Speculation was rife as
to its origin, its meaning, its end.</p>

<p>What was all the talk about?</p>

<p>Andrea, the devoted retainer, however artfully approached on the
subject, was ambiguous to a distressing degree. It was understood,
none the less, that Count Caloveglia was perhaps of use to the
other in the accumulation of classical relics which&mdash;the
Italian Government forbidding the export of antique works of
art&mdash;were smuggled at night-time on board the <i>Flutterby</i>
to be incorporated in a magnificent museum somewhere out West, a
museum which was destined to be presented by van Koppen as a gift
to the great American people. Again, it might be inferred that
these two elderly gentlemen, choice representatives of two
conflicting civilizations, widely experienced and profoundly
versed, each in his own way, in the knowledge of mankind, took a
sincere and childlike pleasure in one another's society, going over
past times and anxious, to the very end of life, to add something
fresh to their store of learning.</p>

<p>Both these explanations were sufficiently plausible to be
straightway dismissed by the majority as inadequate to account for
the phenomenon. They inclined, rather, to adopt an alternative and
alluring theory propounded by the Commissioner's lady. This theory
laid it down that the American was bargaining for the Count's
daughter, a pretty girl whom the old ruffian had shut up in a
convent somewhere in anticipation of the day when a purchaser, rich
enough to content his inordinate lust for gold, should present
himself. Van Koppen was that purchaser. They had now been haggling,
she said, for two or three years; a <i>denouement</i> might be
expected at any moment. If the Count's avarice could be appeased
the unhappy child might expect to find herself, with as little
delay as possible, an inmate of the floating harem on board the
<i>Flutterby</i>.</p>

<p>No visitor was safe from her lively tongue, and alas, certain
little details, insignificant in themselves, gave ground for the
ungenerous hypothesis that van Koppen, like all the rest of them,
had a cloven hoof. There was the usual "dark side" to this
otherwise charming and profitable stranger, the usual mystery, the
usual fly in the ointment. In the first place it was a singular
fact, much commented on, that nobody had ever been invited on board
the yacht. That alone was suspicious. <i>If you want to get
anything out of old Koppen</i>&mdash;so ran a local
saying&mdash;<i>DON'T propose a visit to the 'Flutterby'</i>. More
curious still was the circumstance that nobody, save the owner and
certain bearded venerables of the crew, had ever been known to land
on the island. How about the other passengers? Who were they? The
millionaire never so much as mentioned their existence. It was
surmised, accordingly, that he voyaged over the seas with a bevy of
light-hearted nymphs; a disreputable mode of conduct for a man of
his advanced years, and all the more aggravating to other people
since, like a crafty and jealous old sultan, he screened them from
public view. Impropriety could be overlooked&mdash;it could pass,
where a millionaire was concerned, under the heading of
unconventionality; but such glaring selfishness might end in being
fatal to his reputation.</p>

<p>Confirmatory evidence of this scandalous state of affairs was
obtained, one sunny morning, in the most unexpected fashion. A
fisherman named Luigi, paddling about the stern of the
<i>Flutterby</i> where, in consequence of the kitchen refuse thrown
overboard, marine beasts of every shape and kind were wont to
congregate, cast down his spear at what looked like a splendid
caerulean flat-fish of uncommon size and brilliance. The creature
shivered and collapsed at that contact in the most unnatural,
unfishlike manner; and Luigi drew up, to his amazement, a fragment
of a lady's dress&mdash;to wit, a short length of sky-blue <i>crepe
de chine</i>. Bitterly disappointed, he nevertheless took the
matter with the characteristic Southern philosophy. "This will do
for my little Annarella," he decided. And doubtless the child,
arrayed in these celestial tints, would have been the envy of all
her girl companions at the next festival of the patron saint b for
the fact that Mr. Freddy Parker was strolling on the beach at the
very moment of the man's return to land. By a rare piece of good
luck, as he himself phrased it, his eye fell upon the dripping
fabric; by a stroke of intuition not rare but unique, he divined
its worth as a sociological document. Promising the man a
reasonable sum of money (the Commissioner happened to have no loose
change in his pocket just then) he carried the incrimination morsel
in triumph to the Residency, where it was displayed by his lady, to
all and sundry, in corroboration of her theory.</p>

<p>"That settles it," she used to say. "Unless indeed he dresses up
his cabin-boy as a girl, and in that case..."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, reposing on the rough pumiceous ground with his eye
fixed upon the naughty <i>Flutterby</i> whose virginal whiteness,
with declining day, had assumed a tell-tale crimson blush, pieced
together these and sundry other little bits of information. They
made him more than usually thoughtful; they chimed in with his
momentary mood of self-analysis.</p>

<p>One thing was dead certain. To circumnavigate the globe in the
arms of a dozen chorus-girls was not his ideal. He was not built on
those lines. He purposed, God Willing, to spend the evening of his
days in another and more respectable manner. A vision arose before
his imagination&mdash;a vision of a peaceful homestead among the
green lanes of England, where he would lead a life of study and of
kindly, unostentatious acts, with family and friends; old friends
of College days, and London days, and African days; new friends
from among the rising generation&mdash;straightforward and
decent-minded youngsters, whom he would take to his heart like a
father.</p>

<p>Why could not van Koppen see the beauty of such dreamings?</p>

<p>And yet, he argued, if the man does seclude them in this
fashion&mdash;supposing they really exist&mdash;who can blame him?
No woman is safe on Nepenthe with persons like Muhlen about. From
chance meetings in the street, from stray conversations overheard,
he had been led to take an unreasoning dislike to this foreigner,
whose attitude towards the gentle sex struck him as that of a cur.
Muhlen, if the yacht were his, would flaunt these ladies about the
streets. The American, in keeping them secluded on board, betrayed
a sense of shame, almost of delicacy; a sense of his obligations
towards society which, so far as it went, was rather a laudable
trait of character than otherwise.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;the difference between himself and the
millionaire in life, training, antecedents! A career such as van
Koppen's called for qualities different, often actually
antagonistic, to his own. You could not possibly expect to find in
a successful American merchant those features which go to form a
successful English ecclesiastic. Certain human attributes were
mutually exclusive&mdash;avarice and generosity, for instance;
others no doubt mysteriously but inextricably intertwined. A man
was an individual; he could not be divided or taken to pieces; he
could not be expected to possess virtues incompatible with the rest
of his mental equipment, however desirable such virtues might be.
Who knows? Van Koppen's doubtful acts might be an unavoidable
expression of his personality, an integral part of that nature
under whose ferocious stimulus he had climbed to his present
enviable position. And Mr. Heard was both shocked and amused to
reflect that but for the co-operation of certain coarse organic
impulses to which these Nepenthe legends testified, the millionaire
might never have been able to acquire the proud title of "Saviour
of his Country."</p>

<p>"That's queer," he mused. "It never struck me before. Shows how
careful one must be. Dear me! Perhaps the ladies have inevitable
organic impulses of a corresponding kind. Decidedly queer. H'm. Ha.
Now I wonder...And perhaps, if the truth were known, these young
persons are having quite a good time of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly in his reflections. He had caught himself in
the act; in the very act of condoning vice. Mr. Thomas Heard was
seriously concerned.</p>

<p>Something was wrong, he concluded. He would never have argued on
similar lines a short time ago. This downright sympathy with
sinners, what did it portend? Did it betray a lapse from his
old-established principles, a waning of his respect for traditional
morality? Was he becoming a sinner himself?</p>

<p>Thomas&mdash;the doubting apostle. He wondered whether there was
anything in a name.</p>

<p>Then he called to mind how he had approved&mdash;yes, almost
approved&mdash;of Don Francesco's deplorable act of familiarity
towards the little serving maid. An absurdly small matter, but
symptomatic. Things like that had happened in Africa lately. He
remembered various instances where he had intervened on behalf of
the natives, despite the murmured protests of the missionaries.
They were such laughing, good-natured animals&mdash;so fine and
healthy! What was it, this excessive love of erring humanity, and
whither trending? Mr. Heard began to vex his soul to stray about in
a maze of doubts. It was so miserably complex, this old, old
problem of right and wrong; so unreasonably many-sided. Anon, he
pulled himself together with characteristic bluntness.</p>

<p>"The whole question," he concluded, "is plain as a pikestaff. Am
I becoming more of a Christian, or less?"</p>

<p>As though to learn an answer to his riddle he gazed fro he eyrie
over the wide horizon, upon leagues of sea rising upward to blend
their essence, under the magic touch of evening, with the purple
dome overhead.</p>

<p>The elements, as is their wont upon such occasions, gave forth
no clear reply.</p>

<p>None the less, while the moist south wind, shorn of the sting of
midday, relaxed his pores and passed over his cheek like a warm
caress, there exhaled from those limitless spaces a sense of joyous
amplitude&mdash;of freedom and exhilaration.</p>

</p>

<p>And now, in the sunlit hour of dawn, he was bathing again. An
excellent habit. It did him good, this physical contact with
nature. Africa had weakened his constitution. Nepenthe made him
feel younger once more&mdash;capable of fun and mischief. The
muscles were acquiring a fresh tone, that old zest of life was
coming back to him. His health, without a shadow of doubt, had
greatly improved.</p>

<p>While disporting himself in amphibious joy among the tepid waves
he seemed to cast off that sense of unease which had pursued him of
late. It was good to inhale the harsh salty savour&mdash;to submit
himself to these calming voices&mdash;to float, like a careless
Leviathan, in the blue immensity; good to be alive, simply
alive.</p>

<p>Another hot and clammy day was in store for the island. No
matter. This sirocco, of which older inhabitants might well
complain, had so far exerted no baleful influence upon him. Quite
the reverse. Under its tender moistening touch his frame,
desiccated in the tropics, seemed to open out, even as a withered
flower uncloses its petals in water. In Africa all this thoughts
and energies had been concentrated upon a single point. Here he
expanded. New interests, new sensations, seemed to lie in wait for
him. Never had he felt so alert, so responsive to spiritual
impressions, so appreciative of natural beauty.</p>

<p>Lying in motionless ecstasy on the buoyant element he watched
the mists of morning as they soared into the air. Reluctantly, with
imperceptible movement, they detached themselves from their watery
home; they clambered aloft in spectral companies, drawn skyward, as
by some beckoning hand, under the stealthy compulsion of the sun.
They crept against the tawny precipices, clinging to their
pinnacles like shreds of pallid gauze, and nestling demurely among
dank clefts where something of the mystery of night still lingered.
It was a procession of dainty shapes wreathing themselves into
gracious attitudes; mounting&mdash;ever mounting. As he beheld
their filmy draperies that swayed phantom-like among the crags
overhead, he understood those pagan minds of olden days for whom
such wavering exhalations were none other than sea-nymphs,
Atlantides, offspring of some mild-eyed god of Ocean rising to
greet their playfellows, the Oreads, on the hills.</p>

<p>The wildest stretch of Nepenthe coast-line lay before him. Its
profile suggested not so much the operation of terrestrial forces
as a convulses and calcined lunar landscape&mdash;the handiwork of
some demon in delirium. Gazing landwards, nothing met his eye save
jagged precipices of fearful height, tormented rifts and gulleys
scorched by fires of old into fantastic shapes, and descending
confusedly to where the water slept in monster-haunted caverns.</p>

<p>Not a sign of humanity was visible save one white villa, far
away. It was perched on a promontory of heliotrope-tinted trachyte;
struck by the morning beams it flashed and glowed like a jewel in
the sunshine. He knew the place: Madame Steynlin's abode. The sight
of it reminded him of a promise to attend her picnic next week; all
Nepenthe would be invited, after the feast of Saint Eulalia. And
hard by the shore, at its foot, he discerned certain minute scarlet
specks.</p>

<p>What could they be?</p>

<p>Why, of course! They were recognizable, even at this distance,
as the blouses of the Sacred Sixty-three, who frequented this
somewhat public spot for bathing purposes, blandly indifferent, or
resigned, to the gaze of inquisitive onlookers. Mr. Heard, among
others, had witnessed their aquatic diversions.</p>

<p>The Messiah was hindered by age and growing infirmities from
taking part in the proceedings; moreover, he had been sickening
lately, it was said, for some new Revelation&mdash;a Revelation of
which the island was to become cognizant that very morning. But
others of the Muscovite band were fond of congregating at this spot
and hour for their lustral summer rites&mdash;white-skinned lads
and lasses, matrons and reverent elders, all in a state of Adamitic
nudity, splashing about the water of this sunny cover, devouring
raw fish and crabs after the manner of the fabled Ichthyophagi,
laughing, kissing, saying nice things about God, and combing out
each other's long tow-coloured hair. Madame Steynlin, a spectator
by necessity if not deliberate choice of these patriarchal frolics,
disdained to controvert certain frivolous folk who resorted to the
same beach to gratify a morbid curiosity, under the pretext that it
was a delectable entertainment and one of the sights of Nepenthe.
She disdained, nowadays. It had not ever been thus. Things were
different before Peter the Great came upon the scene. In those
unregenerate times her Lutheran upbringing condemned, in no
measured terms, this frank exhibition of animal nature. A warm
friendship with the good-looking apostle had now opened her eyes to
the mystic sense of what went on. Earthly love had given an
unearthly tinge to her mind. The veil had fallen; she saw through
external appearances into the Symbolic Beyond. Deeply penetrated of
its inner meaning, she would say that the spectacle called up
visions of the Age of Innocence, when the world was young...</p>

<p>An elegant rowing-boat suddenly swept into Mr. Heard's field of
vision. It had approached from round the entrance of the small bay
and was already within a few yards ere he caught sight of it. He
dived skilfully, and on returning to the surface beheld Mr. Keith
smiling upon him, with owlish benevolence, through his
spectacles.</p>

<p>"How pretty you look," he said. "Just like a mermaid that's lost
its tail."</p>

<p>"You flatter me!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Climb in and I'll take you for a row."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better get some clothes on?"</p>

<p>"As you please. We can take you off that boulder if you want to
dress."</p>

<p>"You're very kind."</p>

<p>Kind indeed. To admit a friend into one of his yachts or
rowing-boats was an act of rare self-sacrifice on the part of Mr.
Keith, who maintained that no vessel, not even an Atlantic liner,
was large enough for more than one passenger.</p>

<p>"You are comfortable in here," the bishop remarked, as he
presently stepped on board and looked around him. "Cleopatra's
barge must have been something like this."</p>

<p>"There will be no breeze worth talking about all day. We must
row."</p>

<p>An awning of red silk screened off the rays of the sun; the
appointments of the small boat&mdash;the polished wood of rare
texture, morocco leather cushions, and elaborate
fittings&mdash;bespoke the taste or at least the income of a
Sybarite. A grizzly brown sailor and his curly-pated son were the
oarsmen; in the stern sat a couple of Keith's attendants, whom Mr.
Heard might have mistaken for two Green genii but for the fact that
between them lay an enormous and hideously modern receptacle of
wicker-work which impaired the illusion. It troubled the bishop,
both by reason of its incongruity and because he could not divine
what its purpose might be, till Keith solved the mystery by
saying:</p>

<p>"I thought I would like to see for myself about this fountain of
Saint Elias and, incidentally, enjoy a little al fresco luncheon by
the shore. Now I wonder whether there will be enough food for both
of us in the basket?"</p>

<p>"That thing? Dear me. I thought it might contain a cottage
piano. What fountain?"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard anything? Nothing at all?"</p>

<p>He outlined the events of the preceding day.</p>

<p>"What?" he continued. "They didn't even tell you about Miss
Wilberforce? Well, whether she thought it was her birthday, or
whether all these omens upset her nerves&mdash;Oh, the usual thing,
only rather more so. Decidedly more so. It was late at night, you
see, and she insisted on singing 'Auld Lang Syne,' and even on
translating it, for the benefit of the constable who arrested her,
into her own particular brand of Italian. In fact, there was a good
deal of trouble, till somebody let down a blanket from a window. It
happened to be a new policeman unaccustomed to her ways, and he has
had a bad shock. His wife complained to the judge, who set round
word to me this morning that she was in the lock-up."</p>

<p>"In prison. An English lady!"</p>

<p>"It is not the first time by any means. But I feel exactly as
you do about it. I've bailed her out, and stopped his mouth with a
fifty-franc note. Please keep this between ourselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was not pleased to learn this incident. It seemed a
discordant note on Nepenthe. He observed:</p>

<p>"Miss Wilberforce apparently can be relied upon to create a
diversion of a scandalous nature. I wish I could do something to
help such a poor creature."</p>

<p>"The dear lady! I don't know what we should do without her. By
the way, have you seen Denis lately? We must be friendly to that
young fellow, Heard. I don't think he is altogether happy in this
clear pagan light. He seems to be oppressed about something. What
do you make of him?"</p>

<p>"Of Denis? Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"You interest me."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Because your values appear to be perverted. Your heart remains
dead to Denis, but goes out to a worthless and incurable drunkard.
The one is supremely happy. The other plainly troubled in mind. It
leaves you cold. How do you explain it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard began to wonder. Were his values really vitiated? Had
he done anything to justify self-reproach? He remembered meeting
Denis lately, in a fit of dejection, as it seemed; they had passed
each other with a few words of greeting. Perhaps he might have been
a little more friendly. Well, he would atone for it on the next
occasion. He asked:</p>

<p>"Has he no relations?"</p>

<p>"A mother, at present in Florence. There have been
misunderstandings, I suspect. He has probably found her out, like
he found out our Duchess; like he will find out both you and me, if
we give him the chance. Meanwhile he gropes about in a wistful
fashion, trying to carve out a scheme of life for himself and to
learn something from al lof us. What can a person of that kind have
in common with a mother of any kind?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said Mr. Heard enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. You are thinking of your own mother. You forget
that you never see her. Any son can live with any mother under
those conditions. The fact remains: nobody can misunderstand a boy
like his own mother. Look around you, and see if it is not true!
Honour thy father and thy mother. Perhaps. But we must civilize our
mothers before we can expect any rational companionship between
them and their sons. Girls are different. They are more cynical and
less idealistic, they can put up with mothers, they can laugh at
them. I am speaking in a general way. Of course there are shining
exceptions. Mothers at present can bring children into the world,
but this performance is apt to mark the end of their capacities.
They can't even attend to the elementary animal requirements of
their offspring. It is quite surprising how many children survive
in spite of their mothers. Ask any doctor."</p>

<p>"If that is the case there must be something wrong with our
social system. You may be sure that the female cat or canary bird
is just as efficient in her department as the male in his. Speaking
from my own experience among the London poor, I should say that the
father is often a mere parasite on his wifo and
children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We may both of us be right. But I wish you would take Denis in
hand a little. Will you? Perhaps you misread his character. He may
be afraid of you."</p>

<p>"Have you any particular reason&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I don't like his looks. There is something tragic about him
lately."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was slightly nettled. After all, he was not on
Nepenthe for the purpose of doling out consolations to melancholy
undergraduates.</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to think myself singled out for his
distrust," he replied. "At the same time, I don't notice that he
has much to say to certain other people&mdash;to the Commissioner,
for instance, or to Mr. Muhlen."</p>

<p>"Muhlen? He is quite right to leave Muhlen alone. Quite right.
It proves his intuition. I have learnt all about that man. A
beastly character. He has a bad record. Lives on blackmail and
women. His real name is Retlow."</p>

<p>And Mr. Keith lit a cigar, as though to dismiss the subject.</p>

<p>"Retlow, you say? That's queer."</p>

<p>The name sounded familiar to the bishop. Where had he heard it
before? He racked his memory. Where could it have been? Retlow...It
was not a common name. Long ago, obviously. Where?</p>

<p>In African days, or earlier?</p>

<p>His searchings were interrupted by the voice of the old boatman
who, relinquishing an oar, pointed to a swart precipice near at
hand and said in tolerable English (the older generation of natives
all spoke English&mdash;their children were learning Russian):</p>

<p>"The suicides' rock, gentlemens. Ah! Many is the poor Christian
I have pick up there. He throw down hisself. Him dead. Often in
small pieces. Here blood. Here brain. Here leg and boot. Here
finger. Ah! The poor Chiristian. That so, gentlemens."</p>

<p>The bishop scanned with a shudder this frowning cliff of basalt,
and turned to address his companion.</p>

<p>"Do people really throw themselves over here?"</p>

<p>"Very few. Not more than three or four in a season, I'm told.
The local suicides, as a rule, are not as spectacular as they might
be considering the landscape. They shoot themselves or take poison,
which shows a certain consideration for other people. It is not a
pleasant job, you know, to row to this remote spot and scramble
about the cliff at the risk of a broken neck, collecting shattered
fragments of humanity into a potato sack."</p>

<p>"Not at all pleasant!"</p>

<p>"As compared with England," Keith pursued, "life here is
intense, palpitating, dramatic&mdash;a kind of blood-curdling farce
full of irresponsible crimes and improbable consequences. The soil
is saturated with blood. People are always killing themselves or
each other for motives which, to an Englishman, are altogether
outside the range of comprehensibility. Shall I tell you about one
of our most interesting cases? I happen to be on the island at the
time. There was a young fellow here&mdash;an agreeable young
fellow&mdash;an artist; he was rich; he took a villa, and painted.
We all liked him. Then, by degrees, he became secretive and moody.
Said he was studying mechanics. He told me himself that much as he
liked landscape painting he thought an artist&mdash;a real artist,
he said&mdash;ought to be versed in ancillary sciences; in
fortification, wood-carving, architecture, and so on. Leonardo da
Vinci, you know. Well, one day they could not get into his bedroom.
They broke open his door and discovered that he had constructed a
perfectly-formed guillotine; the knife had fallen; his head lay on
one side and his body on the other. You may well be surprised. I
went carefully into that case. He was in the best of health, with a
creditable artistic record behind him. He had no troubles,
financial or domestic."</p>

<p>"Then what on earth&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The scenery of Nepenthe. It got on his nerves; it unstrung him.
Does that surprise you too? Don't you feel its effect upon
yourself? The bland winds, the sea shining in velvety depths as
though filled with some electric fluid, the riot of vegetation,
these extravagant cliffs that change colour with every hour of the
day? Look at that peak yonder&mdash;is it not almost transparent,
like some crystal of amethyst? This coast-line alone&mdash;the
sheer effrontery of its mineral charm&mdash;might affect some
natures to such an extent as to dislocate their stability. Northern
minds seem to become fluid here, impressionable, unstable,
unbalanced&mdash;what you please. There is something in the
brightness of this spot which decomposes their old particles and
arranges them into fresh and unexpected patterns. That is what
people mean when they say that they 'diswcover' themselves here.
You discover a mechanism, you know, when you take it to pieces. You
catch my meaning?"</p>

<p>"I catch it."</p>

<p>He nodded. He understood perfectly. Some analogous process was
going on within him at that moment. He, too, was discovering
himself.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered yourself, Keith?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by other methods, elsewhere. I am only here for a short
time in the Spring and another ten days in September. That is
hardly enough, even supposing I were the sort of person to be
accessible to these externals. I have passed that stage. I am too
old, too unemotional. I prefer devouring a partridge <i>en
casserole</i> or listening to your conversation ("listening to my
conversation!" thought Mr. Heard) to all the scenery in the world
But I watch other people; I make it my business to study their
condition; I put myself in their places. <i>Je constate</i>, as the
French say. To them, the landscape of Nepenthe is alive, often
malignantly alive. They do what you cannot so effectually do in the
North; they humanize it, identifying its various aspects with their
own moods, its features with their own traditions."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard thought of those tremendous mists he had seen only an
hour ago&mdash;the daughters of old Ocean.</p>

<p>"They humanize it," he echoed. "The mythopoetic faculty!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps this capacity of Southern scenery to bear a mortal
interpretation accounts for the anthropomorphic deities of
classical days. I often think it does. Even we moderns are
unaccountably moved by its varying facets which act sometimes as an
aphrodisiac, and sometimes by their very perfection, their
discouraging spell, their insolent beauty, suggest the hopelessness
of all human endeavour...Denis! I should think him capable of
anything, just now. Do you imagine a person like this could
possibly remain insensible to the beguiling influence of these
surroundings?"</p>

<p>"I never thought about him."</p>

<p>"Really? You interest me, Heard. If you deny the susceptibility
of a temperament like his, you deny the whole operation of
externals upon character and action. You deny, for example, the
success of the Roman Catholic Church which relies, for its moral
effects, upon such optic appeals to the senses, and upon the ease
with which transitory feelings can be transmuted into axioms of
conduct. Do you deny this?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I have seen enough of their system to realize its
extreme simplicity."</p>

<p>"And then think of the peculiar history of this island and its
situation as a converging-point for men of every race and every
creed. All these things stimulate to rapid nervous discharges; that
is, to inconsidered, foolish actions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All fools!" the boatman interrupted. "All foreigners! We people
don't do these things. Only dam-fool foreigners. That so,
gentlemens. They have trouble themselves, then they come to this
rock and, boom! make trouble for their friends."</p>

<p>"Boom!" echoed his son, who had apparently caught the drift of
the old man's speech. Whereat the two Greek genii in the stern
laughed immoderately; knowing, as they did, that the boy had not
the slightest idea of what his father was talking about.</p>

<p>"Boom!" they repeated, in derisive chorus.</p>

<p>At that moment all the occupants of the boat pricked up their
ears. A sound had reached them, a similar sound&mdash;a sound that
recalled the distant firing of a big gun. Boom! It reverberated
among the rocks. The rowers dropped their oars. Everyone
listened.</p>

<p>The sound came again. This time there was no question as to its
origin. It was artillery, beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>The old sailor had grown preternaturally grave.</p>

<p>"<i>Il cannone del duca</i>," he said.</p>

<p>The cannon of the Good Duke Alfred, never used save on urgent or
solemn occasions, was being discharged.</p>

<p>Then the boatman made another remark, in Italian, to Keith.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" asked Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"He thinks they must be calling out the militia."</p>

<p>Something was very wrong, up yonder, on the market-place.</p>

</p>

<p>The cannon, to be hereinafter described, is not the sole
surviving relic of the Good Duke's rule. Turn where you please on
this island domain, memories of that charming and incisive
personality will meet your eye and ear; memories in stone-schools,
convents, decayed castles and bathing chalets; memories in the
spoken word&mdash;proverbs attributed to him, legends and
traditions of his sagacity that still linger among the populace.
<i>In the days of the Duke</i>: so runs a local saying, much as we
speak of the "good old times." His amiable laughter-loving ghost
pervades the capital to this hour. His pleasantries still resound
among those crumbling theatres and galleries. That gleeful deviltry
of his, compounded of blood and sunshine, is the epitome of
Nepenthe. He is the scarlet thread running through its annals. An
incarnation of all that was best in the age he identified, for
wellnigh half a century, his interests with those of his faithful
subjects.</p>

<p>He meditated no conquests. It sufficed him to gain and to retain
the affection of men in whose eyes he was not so much a prince, a
feudal lord, as an indulgent and doting father. He was the ideal
despot, a man of wide culture and simple tastes. "A smile," he used
to say, "will sway the Universe." Simplicity he declared to be the
keynote of his nature, the guiding motive of his governance. In
exemplification whereof he would point to his method of collecting
taxes&mdash;a marvel of simplicity. Each citizen paid what he
liked. If the sum proved insufficient he was apprised of the fact
next morning by having his left hand amputated; a second error of
judgment&mdash;it happened rather seldom&mdash;was rectified by the
mutilation of the remaining member. "Never argue with inferiors,"
was one of His Highness's most original and pregnant remarks, and
it was observed that, whether he condescended to argue or not, he
generally gained his point without undue loss of time.</p>

<p>"It's so simple," he would say to those perplexed potentates who
flocked to him from the mainland for advice on administrative
questions. "So simple! One knock to each nair. And keep
smiling."</p>

<p>It was the Good Duke Alfred who, with a shrewd eye to the future
prosperity of his dominions, made the first practical experiments
with those hot mineral springs&mdash;those healing waters whose
virtues, up till then, had been unaccountable neglected. Realizing
their curative possibilities, he selected fifty of the oldest and
wisest of his Privy Councillors to undergo a variety of
hydro-thermal tests on their bodies, internal and external. Seven
of these gentlemen had the good luck to survive the treatment. They
received the Order of the Golden Vine, a coveted distinction. The
remaining forty-three, what was left of them, were cremated at
night-time and posthumously ennobled.</p>

<p>He was the author of some mighty fine dissertations on falconry,
dancing and architecture. He wrote furthermore, in the flamboyant
style of his period, two dozen pastoral plays, as well as a goodly
number of verses addressed, for the most part, to ladies of his
Court&mdash;a Court which was thronged with poets, wits,
philosophers and noble women. The island was a gay place in those
days! There was always something doing. His Highness had a trick of
casting favourites into dungeons, and concubines into the sea, that
endeared him to his various legitimate spouses; and the rapidity
with which these self-same spouses were beheaded one after the
other, to make room for what he mirthfully called "fresh blood,"
struck his faithful subjects as an ever-recurring miracle of
statecraft. "Nothing," he used to say to his intimates, "nothing
ages a man like living always with the same woman." Well aware, on
the other hand, of the inequality of social conditions and keenly
desirous of raising the moral tone of his people, he framed iron
laws to restrain those irregularities of married life which had
been a disreputable feature of local society prior to his
accession.</p>

<p>Not in vain had he pondered in youth the political maxims of the
great Florentine. He cultivated assiduously the friendship of
Church and Mob; he knew that no throne, however seemingly
well-established, can weather the blasts of fortune save by resting
on those twin pillars of security. So it came about that, while all
Europe was convulsed in savage warfare, his relations with other
rulers were marked by rare cordiality and simplicity of
intercourse. He never failed to conciliate his more powerful
neighbours by timely gifts of local delicacies&mdash;gifts of
dark-eyed virgins to grace their palaces, and frequent hampers of
those succulent <i>langoustes</i> for which the coastal waters of
the island are renowned, both items of the finest quality
obtainable. A born statesman, he extended this ingratiating
demeanour even to those minor sovereigns from whom, to all
appearance, she had nothing to fear, supplying them likewise with
periodical consignments of pretty maidens and well-flavoured
crayfish, only of somewhat inferior quality&mdash;the crustaceans
often too young, the damsels occasionally over-ripe.</p>

<p>His high aspirations made him the precursor of many modern
ideas. In educational and military matters, more especially, he
ranks as a pioneer. He was a pedagogue by natural instinct. He took
a sincere delight in the school-children, limited their weekly
half-holidays to five, designed becoming dresses for boys and
girls, decreed that lute playing and deportment should become
obligatory subjects in the curriculum, and otherwise reformed the
scholastic calendar which, before his day, had drifted into sad
confusion and laxity. Sometimes he honoured the ceremony of
prize-giving with his presence. On the other hand it must be
admitted that, judged by modern standards, certain of his methods
for punishing disobedience smacks of downright pedantry. Thrice a
year, on receiving form the Ministry of Education a list containing
the names of unsatisfactory scholars of either sex, it was his
custom to hoist a flag on a certain hill-top; this was a signal for
the Barbary pirates, who then infested the neighbouring ocean, to
set sail for the island and buy up these perverse children, at
purely nominal rates, for the slave-markets of Stamboul and Argier.
They were sold ignominiously&mdash;by weight and not by the
piece&mdash;to mark his unqualified disapproval of talking and
scribbling on blotting-pads during school hours.</p>

<p>It is recorded of the Good Duke that on one occasion he returned
from this scene looking haggard and careworn, as though the
sacrifice of so many young lives weighed on his fatherly spirit.
Presently, envisaging his duties towards the State, he restrained
these natural but unworthy emotions, smiled his well-known smile,
and gave utterance to an apophthegm which had since found its way
into a good many copy-books: "In the purity of childhood," he said,
"lie the seeds of national prosperity." And if it be enquired by
what arts of Machiavellian astuteness he alone, of all Christian
princes, contrived to maintain friendly relations with these
formidable Oriental sea-rovers, the answer lies at hand. His device
was one of extreme simplicity. He appealed to their better natures
by sending them, at convenient intervals, shiploads of local
delicacies, girls and lobsters&mdash;of indifferent quality, it is
true, but sufficiently appetizing to attest his honourable
intentions.</p>

<p>His predecessors, intent only upon their pleasures, had given no
thought to the possibility of a hostile invasion of their fair
domain. But the Good Duke, despite his popularity, was frequently
heard to quote with approval that wise old adage which runs "In
peace, prepare for war." Convinced of the instability of all
mundane affairs and being, moreover, a man of original notions as
well as something of an artist in costumery, he was led to create
that picturesque body of men, the local Militia, which survives to
this day and would alone entitle him to the grateful notice of
posterity. These elegant warriors, he calculated, would serve both
for the purpose of infusing terror into the minds of potential
enemies, and of acting as a decorative body-guard to enhance his
own public appearances on gala days. He threw his whole soul into
the enterprise. After the corps had been duly established, he
amused himself by drilling them on Sunday afternoons and modelling
new buttons for their uniforms; to give them the requisite military
stamina he over-fed and starved them by turns, wrapped them in
sheepskin overcoats for long route-marches in July, exercised them
in sham fights with live grapeshot and unblunted stilettos and
otherwise thinned their ranks of undesirables, and hardened their
physique, by forcing them to escalade horrible precipices at
midnight on horseback. He was a martinet; he knew it; he gloried on
the distinction. "All the world loves a disciplinarian," he was
wont to say.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, like many great princes, he realized that
political reasons might counsel at times an abatement of rigour. He
could relent and show mercy. He could interpose his authority in
favour of the condemned.</p>

<p>He relented on one celebrated occasion which more than any other
helped to gain for him the epithet of "The Good"&mdash;when an
entire squadron of the Militia was condemned to death for some
supposed mistake in giving the salute. The record, unfortunately,
is somewhat involved in obscurity and hard to disentangle; so much
is clear, however, that the sentence was duly promulgated and
carried into effect within half an hour. Then comes the moot
question of the officer in command who was obviously destined for
execution with the rest of his men and who now profited, as events
proved, by the clemency of the Good Duke. It appears that this
individual, noted for a childlike horror of bloodshed (especially
when practiced on his own person), had unaccountably absented
himself from the ceremony at the last moment&mdash;slipping out of
the ranks in order, as he said, to bid a last farewell to his two
aged and widowed parents. He was discovered in a wine-shop and
brought before a hastily summoned Court-martial. There his old
military courage seems to have returned to him. He demonstrated by
a reference to the instructions laid down in the Militiaman's
Year-book that no mistake in saluting had been made, that his men
had therefore been wrongfully convicted and illegally executed and
that he <i>a fortiori</i>, was innocent of any felonious intent.
The Court, while approving his arguments, condemned him none the
less to the indignity of a double decapitation for the offence of
leaving his post without a signed permit from His Highness.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the Good Duke interposed on his
behalf. He rescinded the decree; in other words, he relented.
"Enough of bloodshed for one day," he was heard to remark, quite
simply.</p>

<p>This speech was one of his happiest inspirations. Instantly it
echoed from mouth to mouth; from end to end of his dominions.
Enough of bloodshed for one day! That showed his true heart, the
people declared. Enough of bloodshed! Their enthusiasm grew wilder
when, in an access of princely graciousness, he repaired the
lamentable excess of zeal by pinning the Order of the Golden Vine
to the offending officer's breast; it rose to a veritable frenzy as
soon as they learned that, by Letters Patent, the entire defunct
squadron had been posthumously ennobled. And this is only one of
many occasions on which this ruler, by his intimate knowledge of
human nature and the arts of government, was enabled to wrest good
from evil, and thereby consolidate his throne...</p>

<p>It is passing strange, on the face of it, that this vivid
personality, one of the most arresting figures in the history of
the country, should be so briefly dealt with in the pages of
Monsignor Perrelli. Doubly strange, and a serious disappointment to
the reader, in view of the fact that the two men were
contemporaries, and that the learned writer must have enjoyed
exceptional facilities for obtaining first-hand knowledge of his
subject. Almost inexplicable indeed, when one remembers those
maxims which he himself, in the Introduction to his
<i>Antiquities</i>, lays down for the writing of history; when one
calls to mind his own gleams of exotic scholarship, those luminous
asides and fruitful digressions, those statesmanlike comments on
things in general which make his work not so much a compendium of
local lore as a mirror of the polite learning of his age. It is no
exaggeration to say that, compared with the ample treatment meted
out to inconspicuous rulers like Alfonso the Seventeenth or
Florizel the Fat, his account of the Good Duke Alfred is the
baldest, the most perfunctory and conventional of chronicles.
Neither good nor evil is related of him. There is nothing but a
monotonous enumeration of events.</p>

<p>It was the bibliographer who, poring over the pages of the rival
monk Father Capocchio, that audacious and salacious friar already
mentioned&mdash;it was the bibliographer who hit upon a passage
which suggested a solution of the mystery and proved that, though
Monsignor Perrelli lived during the reign of the Good Duke, it
would be stretching unduly the sense of a plain word to say that he
"flourished" under his rule. Other persons may have flourished; not
so the kindly prelate.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," says this implacable enemy of Nepenthe, "is
to be recorded to the credit of the sanguinary brigand&mdash;so he
terms the Good Duke&mdash;nothing whatsoever: save and except only
this, that he cut off the ears of a certain prattler, intriguer,
and snuff-taking sensualist called Perrelli who, under the pretence
of collecting data for an alleged historical treatise, profited by
his priestly garb to play fast and loose with what little remained
of decent family life on that God-abandoned island. Honour to whom
honor is due! The ostensible reason for this unique act of justice
was that the said Perrelli had appeared at some palace function
with paste buckles on his shoes, instead of silver ones. The
pretext was well chosen, inasmuch as the tyrant added to his other
vices and absurdities the pose of being an extravagant stickler for
etiquette. We happen to know, nevertheless, that the name of a
young dancer, a prime favourite at Court, cropped up persistently
at the time in connection with this malodorous but otherwise
insignificant episode."</p>

<p>It were idle, at this hour of the day, to pursue the enquiry;
the mutilation of Monsignor Perrelli's person, however, would
explain better than anything else his equivocal attitude as
historian. Nor is the incident altogether inconsistent with what we
know of the Duke's cheerful propensities. "Nose after ears!" was
one of his blithest watchwords. Faced with so dispiriting a
prospect and aware that His Highness was as good as his princely
word, the sympathetic scholar, while too resentful to praise his
achievements, may well have been too prudent to disparage them.
Hence his reticence, his circumspection. Hence that monotonous
enumeration of events.</p>

<p>This microscopic blot on the Duke's escutcheon, as well as other
more commendable details of his life, were duly noted down by the
zealous Mr. Eames who, in addition, had the good fortune to receive
as a gift from his kindly but unassuming friend Count Caloveglia a
quaint portrait of the prince, hitherto unknown&mdash;an engraving
which he purposed to reproduce, together with other fresh
iconographical material, in his enlarged and fully annotated
edition of the <i>Antiquities</i>. The print depicts His Highness
full face, seated on a throne in the accoutrements of Mars, with a
gallant wig flowing in mazy ringlets from under the helmet upon his
plated shoulders; overhead, upon a canopy of cloud, reclines a
breezy assemblage of allegorical females&mdash;Truth, Mercy, Fame
with her trumpet, and so forth. His nervous clean-shaven features
do not wear the traditional smile; they are thoughtful, almost
grim. On his left is portrayed a huge <i>cannon</i> astride of
which can be seen a chubby angel; the Duke's hand reposes, in a
paternal caress on the cherub's head&mdash;symbolical doubtless of
his love of children. His right elbow rests upon a table, and the
slender bejewelled fingers are listlessly pressing open a lettered
scroll of parchment on which can be deciphered the words "<i>a chi
t'ha figliato</i>" (to her who bare thee)&mdash;a legend which the
bibliographer, whose acquaintance with the vernacular was not on a
level with his classical attainments, conjectured to be some
fashionable courtly toast of the period.</p>

<p>The mention of artillery recalls the fact that His Highness was
an amateur of ordnance. He established a gun-foundry on the island,
and what he did not know about the art of casting pieces, as
practised in his day, was plainly not worth knowing. Had it not
been for his passionate love of testing new processes and new
combinations of metal, he might have attained to a European
reputation in that department. But he was always experimenting, and
the consequence was that his cannons were always splitting. One,
however, a monster of its kind, remained intact, to outward
appearances. It was fired on every conceivable occasion&mdash;to
summon the Militia, for example, from remote corners of the island
at any hour of the day or night, a considerable hardship to those
who lived at a distance of two or three miles, seeing that
according to the instructions set forth in the Militiaman's
Year-book, the sternest penalties were imposed upon all who failed
to appear in their ranks at the Palace gates within five minutes
after the signal had been sounded.</p>

<p>It was a perilous gun to handle. Owing to some undiscoverable
flaw of construction or imperfection in the alloy, the monster soon
developed a disconcerting knack of back-firing, hazardous to life
and limb. It stands to reason that the Good Duke attached no undue
importance to any trifling disaster accruing therefrom. On the
contrary, in order to be sure of a thunderous detonation, he often
deigned to superintend in person the loading of this particular
piece.</p>

<p>"More powder," he would then command. "More powder! Ram it in!
Never mind her little caprices! A good salute is worth a good
soldier! More powder! Fill her up to the brim! She's only playful,
like her master." Those who lost fingers or hands or arms received
the Order of the Golden Vine. Whenever a major portion of the
anatomy, a head or so forth, went astray, the victim was
posthumously ennobled.</p>

<p>Since his day, thanks to the science of a Paduan engineer, this
defect has been almost completely overcome, and the gun can still
be heard on great occasions, such as the Duke's birthday, the
Festival of the Patron Saint, or the visit to the island of some
foreign sovereign; it is also discharged, as of yore, to summon the
Militia for the purpose of quelling any popular disturbance. But
even now it occasionally relapses into its old humours&mdash;with
this difference, that instead of being decorated with a coveted
distinction, the disabled man is sent to the hospital and told not
to make a fool of himself next time.</p>

<p>This was the gun whose sound attracted the strained attention of
Mr. Keith and his companions, far away, on the sea, under the
cliffs.</p>

</p>

<p>The firing had ceased; the boat began to glide forwards once
more. But Mr. Heard's eye remained fixed upon the ill-omened black
rock. The sun's rays had already licked dry the moisture on its
surface; it shone with a steady dull glow. Some malefic force
seemed to dwell here. Some demon haunted the place, peering out of
the crevices or rising up from the turquoise-tinted water at its
foot. The suicides' rock!</p>

<p>That vague sense of apprehension, of impending disaster, once
more invaded him. Suddenly it revealed itself in definite terms. A
ghastly notion flitted through his mind.</p>

<p>"You think it possible that Denis&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<p>His friend seemed to have lost all interest in that subject. It
was a way he had.</p>

<p>"Denis? I really could not tell. I'm not sufficiently in his
confidence...Honour thy father and thy mother," he proceeded,
reverting to his former theme. "What think you, Heard, of this old
injunction? Is it not altogether obsolete? Was it not written for
quite other conditions? Honour thy father and mother. Why? The
State educates children, feeds them, investigates and cures their
complaints, washes and weighs them, reports on their teeth and
stomachs, prescribes when they may begin to smoke and enter
public-houses: where does parental authority come in? The State
provides old folks with refuges and pensions: how about the former
obligations of children? Child and parent alike now thank the
community for what they once received from each other. And the
geographical elements that went to the making of a home are also
dispersed. Rich and poor roam like gipsies from one country to
another, from one flat into the next; the patriarchal board is
replaced by clubs and grill-rooms and fried-fish shops. Many a man
who thinks to found a home discovers that he has merely opened a
tavern for his friends. Note, too, that the family has outgrown its
ecclesiastical sanction; the oil of supernaturalism which once
greased the wheels has run dry; the machinery is creaking.
Industrial conditions have killed the old home. <i>Requiescat</i>!
Honour thy father and mother. Industrialism has killed that
commandment. Thou shalt not steal. Consider this injunction, Heard,
and ask yourself whether industrialism does not split its sides
with laughing at it. If we are to galvanize that old collection of
laws into some semblance of life, every one f them must be
re-written and brought up to date. They are inappropriate for
modern life; their interest is purely historical. We want new
values. We are no longer nomads. Industrialism has killed the
pastoral and the agricultural points of view. And how the modern
Jews smile at our infatuation for those queer doctrines and legends
which they themselves have long ago outgrown. Apropos, what has
become of Marten?"</p>

<p>"Left the island, I hear."</p>

<p>"Quick work. Now I wonder why?"</p>

<p>Everybody wondered at Marten's precipitate departure. Even
Angelina wondered.</p>

<p>She just wondered.</p>

<p>Had he known that she wondered, he might have been tempted to
prolong his stay. But Marten was too young to be a practical
psychologist. He had lived for half a day in terror of what he
called "the inevitable reaction," unaware of the fact that certain
people do not suffer from reactions and too engrossed in mineralogy
to have learnt, from a study of other sciences, that Angelina was
one of them. She had passed that stage, with Homeric laughter, long
before his appearance on Nepenthe. She just wondered, nowadays.</p>

<p>Scared, as though the avenging Furies were at his heels, he
quitted the scene of his nocturnal romance, leaving half his
geological projects incomplete. Had he taken the amiable Don
Francesco into his confidence he might have heard something to his
advantage. But the scientist could not endure the sight of a
Christian priest. Like other intolerant folk he was now paying for
his prejudices.</p>

<p>"An erotic little beast," Keith went on. "And a typical
Hebrew&mdash;a scoffer. Have you noticed what a disruptive and
irreverential brood they are? They move up and down society like
some provocative fluid, insensible to our ideals; they take a
diabolical pleasure in shattering our old-established conceptions
of right and wrong. I confess I like them for that; they need
shattering, some of those conceptions. And they have their
weaknesses too, their Achilles heel&mdash;music, for instance, or
chess. When next you are in town don't forget to go to that little
chess club of theirs over Aldgate East station. It is better than a
play to watch their faces. And with all this materialism they have
a mysterious feminine leaven of enthusiasm and unworldliness. What
pecuniary advantage could Marten expect to gain from his
minerals?"</p>

<p>"A professorship."</p>

<p>"Why, possibly. He had the professorial temperament; there was
not much poetry in his composition. If you were to ask him, 'What
are those wonderful rocks over there, shaped like some Titanic
organ and glowing with a kind of violet flame?' he would say,
'Organ be blowed. It's columnar lithoidite.' I learnt a little from
him, but not enough. I wish we had him here. He could have told us
something."</p>

<p>And Mr. Keith, ever avid of fresh things, regretted his lost
opportunities. He was in one of this acquisitive, Corsair moods. He
said:</p>

<p>"I could take geology by the throat just now. It's disgusting,
not to know things!"</p>

<p>His companion, meanwhile, beheld the panorama in all its
nightmarish splendour, as it drifted past him. He saw the bluffs of
feathery pumice, the lava precipices&mdash;frozen cataracts of
white, black, blood red, pale grey and sombre brown, smeared over
with a vitreous enamel of obsidian or pierced by oily, writhing
dykes that blazed with metallic scintillations. Anon came some
yawning cleft or an assemblage of dizzy rock-needles, fused into
whimsical tints and attitudes, spiky, distorted, over-toppling;
then a bold tufa rampart, immaculate in its beauty, stainless as a
curtain of silk. And as the boat moved on he looked into horrid
dells which the rains had torn out of the loose scoriae. Gaping
wounds, they wore the bright hues of corruption. Their flanks were
blotched with a livid nitrous efflorescence, with flaring sulphur,
unhealthy verdure of pitchstone, streaks of arsenical vermilion;
their beds&mdash;a frantic maze of boulders.</p>

<p>He beheld this crazy stratification, this chaos of incandescent
nature, sent in a flame of deep blue sky and sea. It lay there
calmly, like some phantasmagoric flower, some monstrous rose that
swoons away, with upturned face, in a solar caress.</p>

<p>He saw it with the eye. His mind was elsewhere. He was trying,
in honest and relentless fashion, to discover himself. What if his
human values were really wrong?</p>

<p>Thomas, the doubting apostle...</p>

<p>Africa had made him think; had made him more silent and
reflective than ever. And now this sudden strange stimulus of
Nepenthe&mdash;it was driving his thoughts headlong, out of their
old grooves.</p>

<p>Here was Keith, a man of altogether different stamp, drawing
conclusions which he dared not formulate for himself. How far were
they applicable, those old Hebrew precepts, to modern conditions?
Were they still availing as guides to conduct?</p>

<p>"You are a candid person, Keith, and I think I am. I sincerely
try to be. Will you tell me what you think? You seem to have a
quarrel with Moses and his commandments, which we are taught to
regard as the keystone of ethics. I don't want to discuss things. I
want to listen to the opinions of a man so different from myself as
you are. It may do me good. And I think I could stand almost
anything," he added, with a laugh, "in this landscape&mdash;in this
clear pagan light, as you call it."</p>

<p>"I used to be interested in such things as a boy. I suppose all
respectable boys are; and I was respectable even at that tender
age. Nowadays, though I still pick up an Oriental rug now and then,
I have no further use for Oriental gods."</p>

<p>"What is your objection to them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Keith paused before replying. Then he said:</p>

<p>"The drawback of Oriental gods is that they have been
manufactures by the proletariat for the use of the aristocracy.
They act accordingly; that is, they distil the morality of their
creators which I consider a noxious emanation. The classic gods
were different. They were invented by intellectualists who felt
themselves capable of maintaining a kind of comradeship with their
deities. Men and gods were practically on a level. They walked hand
in hand over the earth. These gods belonged to what one might call
the horizontal or downstairs variety."</p>

<p>"And those others?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are the upstairs or vertical type. They live overhead.
Why overhead? Because they have been created by the proletariat.
The proletariat loves to humiliate itself. Therefore they
manufacture a god who approves of grovelling, a god who can look
down upon them. They exalt this deity to an infinite degree in
point of goodness and distance, and in so doing they inevitably
abase themselves. Now I disapprove of grovelling. That means I
disapprove of upstairs gods."</p>

<p>"Upstairs gods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you walk into my front door as a distinguished visitor I am
happy to show you the place. You can prowl about the garden, poke
your nose into the pantry and learn, if it amuses you, all about my
private life. But if you rent a high attic overlooking my premises
and stair out of your window all day long, watching my movements
and noting down everything I do, why, damn it, I call that vulgar.
Staring is bad form. Vertical gods are inquisitive. I don't like to
be supervised. I don't care about this <i>dossier</i> business. My
garden is for you and me to walk about in, not for outsiders to
stare into. Which reminds me that you have not been to see me
lately. You ought to come and look at my cannas; you really ought!
They are in magnificent bloom just now. When shall it be?"</p>

<p>Mr. Keith seemed to be already tired of the subject. In fact he
was as near being bored as ever he allowed himself to be. But the
other refused to let the conversation be side-tracked. He wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"Vertical and horizontal gods...Dear me. Sounds rather
profane."</p>

<p>"I have not heard that word for quite a long time."</p>

<p>"You don't feel the need of any kind of superior being to
control human affairs?"</p>

<p>"Not up to the present. I can find no room in my Cosmos for a
deity, save as a waste product of human weakness, an excrement of
the imagination. If you gave me the sauciest god that ever sat on a
cloud or breakfasted with the Village Idiot&mdash;'pon my word, I
shouldn't know what to do with him. I don't collect bric-a-brac
myself, and the British Museum is dreadfully overstocked. Perhaps
the Duchess could make some use of him, if he specialized in lace
vestments and choral mass. By the way, I hear that she is going to
be admitted into the Roman Church next week; there is to be a
luncheon after the ceremony. Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Vertical and horizontal gods...I never heard that distinction
made before."</p>

<p>"It is a difference, my dear Heard. Mankind remains in direct
contact with the downstairs variety. That simplifies matters. But
the peculiar position of those others&mdash;perpendicularly
overhead at a vast distance&mdash;necessitates a troublesome code
of verbal signals, unintelligible to common folk, for the
expression of mutual desires. You cannot have any god of this kind
without some such cumbrous contrivance to bridge over the gulf and
make communication possible. It is called theology. It complicates
life very considerably. Yes," he pursued, "the vertical-god system
is not only vulgar; it is perplexing and expensive. Think of the
wastage, of the myriads of people who have been sacrificed because
they misinterpreted some enigmatical word in the code. Why are you
intent on these conundrums?"</p>

<p>"Well, partly at least, it's quite a practical matter. You know
that American millionaire, van Koppen, and the scandal attached to
his peculiar habits? It made me wonder, only yesterday&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this juncture the tiresome old boatman lifted up his
voice once more.</p>

<p>"See that high cliff, gentlemens? Funny thing happen there, very
funny. Dam-fool foreigner here, he collect flowers. Always
collecting flowers on bad rocks; sometimes with rope round him, for
fear of falling; with rope, ha, ha, ha! Nasty man. And poor. No
money at all. He always say, 'All Italians liars, and liars where
go? To Hell, sure. That's where liars go. That's where Italians
go.' Now rich man he say liar to poor man. But poor man, he better
not say liar to rich man. That so, gentlemens. One day he say liar
to nice old Italian. Nice old man think: 'Ah, you wait, putrid
puppy of bastard pig, you wait.' Nice old man got plenty good lot
vineyards back of cliff there. One day he walk to see grapes. Then
he look to end of cliff and see rope hanging. Very funny, he think.
Then he look to end of rope and see nasty-man hanging. That so,
gentlemens. Nasty-man hanging in air. Can't get up. 'Pull me up,'
says he. Nice old man, he laugh&mdash;ha, ha, ha! laugh till his
belly hurt. Then he pull out knife and begin to cut rope. 'See
knife?' he shout down. 'How much to pull up?' Five hundred dollar!
'How much?' Five thousand! 'How much?' Fifty thousand! Nice old man
say quite quiet: 'You no got fifty thousand in the world, you liar.
Liars where go? To Hell, sure. That's where liars go. That's where
you go, Mister. To Hell.' And he cut rope. Down he go, patatrac!
round and round in air, like firework wheel, on to first
rock&mdash;pa-pa-pa-paff! Six hundred feets. After that he arrive,
all messy, in water. That so, gentlemens. Gone where to? Swim to
Philadelphia? I don't think! Him drownded, sure. Ha, ha, ha! Nice
old man, when he come home that morning, he laugh. He laugh. He
just laugh. He laugh first quiet, then loud. He laugh all the time,
and soon family too. He laugh for ten days, till he nearly die. Got
well again, and live plenty good years after. In Paradise to-day,
God rest his soul! And never found out, no never. Fine judge on
Nepenthe. Always fine judge here. He know everything, and he know
nothing. Understand? All nice people here. That so,
gentlemens."</p>

<p>He told the tale with Satanic gusto, rocking himself to and fro
as though convulsed with some secret joy. Then, after expectorating
violently, he resumed the oars which had been dropped in the heat
of gesticulation.</p>

<p>The bishop was pensive. There was something wrong with this
story&mdash;something fundamentally wrong. He turned to Keith:</p>

<p>"That man must be a liar too. If, as he says, the thing was
never found out, how can he have learnt all about it?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear fellow. He thinks I don't know, but I do. It was
his own father to whom the adventure occurred."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c25.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>"The adventure!" said Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"The adventure. Surely you are not going to make a tragedy of
it? If you cannot see the joke of that story, you must be hard to
please. I nearly died of laughing when I first heard it."</p>

<p>"What would you have done?"</p>

<p>"If I had been the botanist? I would not have made myself
disagreeable to the natives. Also, I would not have got myself into
a tangle with that rope."</p>

<p>"You think he ought to have cut it?"</p>

<p>"What else could the poor fellow do? It strikes me, Heard, you
attach some inordinate importance to human life."</p>

<p>"It's all rather complex," sighed the bishop.</p>

<p>"Now that is really interesting!"</p>

<p>"Interesting?"</p>

<p>"Why should you find it complex, when I find it simple? Let me
see. Our lives are perfectly insignificant, aren't they? We know it
for a fact. But we don't like it. We don't like being of no
account. We want some thing to make us feel more valuable than we
are. Consequently we invent a fiction to explain away that
insignificance&mdash;the fiction of a personality overhead
everlastingly occupied in watching every single one of us, and
keenly engrossed in our welfare. If this were the case, we would
cease to be insignificant, and we might try to oblige him by not
killing each other. It happens to be a fiction. Get rid of the
fiction, and your feeling of complexity evaporates. I perceive you
are in an introspective mood. Worrying about some pastoral
epistle?"</p>

<p>"Worry about my values, as you would say. Up to the present,
Keith, I don't seem to have had time to think; I had to act; there
was always something urgent to be taken in hand. Now that I am
really lazy for the first time, and in this stimulating
environment, certain problems of life keep cropping up. Minor
problems, of course; for it is a consolation to know that the
foundations of good conduct are immutable. Our sense of right and
wrong is firmly implanted in us. The laws of morality, difficult as
they often are to understand, have been written down for our
guidance in letters that never change."</p>

<p>"Never change? You might as well say, my dear Heard, that these
cliffs never change. The proof that the laws of good conduct change
is this, that if you were upright after the fashion of your
great-grandfather you would soon find yourself in the clutches of
the law for branding a slave, or putting a bullet through someone
in a duel. I grant that morality changes slowly. It changes slowly
because the proletariat, whose product it is, does the same. There
is not much difference, I imagine, between the crowds of old
Babylon and new Shoreditch; hence their peculiar emanations
resemble each other more or less. That is why morality compares so
unfavourably with intellectuality, which is the product of the
upper sections of society and flashes out new lights every moment.
But even morality changes. The Spartans, a highly moral people,
thought it positively indecent not to steal. A modern vice, such as
mendacity, was accounted a virtue by the greatest nation of
antiquity. A modern virtue, like that of forgiving one's enemies,
was accounted a vice proper to slaves. Drunkenness, reprobated by
ancients and moderns alike, became the mark of a gentlemen in
intermediate periods."</p>

<p>"I see what you are driving at. You wish me to think that this
fictitious value, as you would call it&mdash;this halo of
sanctity&mdash;with which we now invest a human life, may be blown
away at any moment. Possibly you are right. Perhaps we English do
exaggerate its importance. They don't take much account of life in
my part of Africa."</p>

<p>"And then, I disagree with what you say about the difficulty of
understanding the laws of morality. Any child can grasp the
morality of its period. Why should I pretend to be interested in
what a child can grasp? If is a positive strain to keep one's mind
at that low level. Why should I impose this strain upon myself?
When a group-up man shows an unfeigned interest in such questions I
regard him as a case of arrested development. All morality is a
generalization, and all generalizations are tedious. Why should I
plague myself with what is tedious? Altogether the question that
confronts me is not whether morality is worth talking about, but
whether it's worth laughing at. Sometimes I think it is. It reminds
me of those old pantomime jokes that make one quite sad, at first,
with their heart-breaking vulgarity; those jokes, you know, that
have to be well rubbed in before we begin to see how really funny
they are. And, by Jove, they do rub this one in, don't they? You
must talk to Don Francesco about these things. You will find him
sound, though he does not push his conclusions as far as I
do&mdash;not in public, at least. Or to Count Caloveglia. He is a
remarkable Latin, that old man. Why don't you drive up one day and
have a look at his Locri Faun? Street, the South Kensington man,
thinks very highly of it."</p>

<p>"I would like to listen to you just now. I am listening, and
thinking. Please go on. I'll preach you my sermon some other
day."</p>

<p>"Will you? I wonder! I don't believe, Heard, that you will
preach another sermon in your life. I don't think you will ever go
back to Africa, or to any other episcopal work. I think you have
reached a turning point."</p>

<p>The bishop was thoughtful for a moment. Those words went home.
Then he said lightly:</p>

<p>"You are in better vein than you were a short while ago."</p>

<p>"That story of the botanist has revived me. He tells it rather
well, doesn't he? It is good to inhabit a world where such things
can still happen. I feel as if life were worth living. I feel as if
I could discuss anything. What were you going to say about the
American millionaire?"</p>

<p>"Ah yes," replied Mr. Heard. "I wondered, supposing these
reports about the ladies are true, how far you and I, for example,
should condone his vices."</p>

<p>"Vices. My dear bishop! Under a sky like this. Have a good look
at it; do."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, barely conscious of what he was doing, obeyed the
counsel. Raising his hand, he pushed the silken awning to one side.
Then he peered skyward, into the noonday zenith; into an ocean of
blue, immeasurable. There was no end to this azure liquid. Gazing
thus, his intelligence became aware of the fact that there are
skies of different kinds. This one was not quite like his native
firmament. Here was no suggestion of a level space overhead,
remote, but still conceivable&mdash;a space whereon some god might
have sat enthroned, note-book in hand, jotting down men's virtues,
and vices, and what not. A sky of this kind was obviously not built
to accommodate deities in a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Instead of commenting on this simple observation he
remarked:</p>

<p>"I mean, whether one should publicly approve of van Koppen's
ladies, supposing they exist."</p>

<p>"Why should I approve or disapprove? Old Koppen's activities do
not impinge on mine. Like a sensible fellow he cultivates a hobby.
He indulges himself. Why interfere? Tell me, why should I
disapprove of things?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Keith! Not long ago you were disapproving of
vertical gods."</p>

<p>"That is different. They do impinge on my activities."</p>

<p>"Are the peculiar hobbies of their votaries distasteful to
you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Their hobbies do not clash with mine. To feel
righteous, or to feel sinful, is quite an innocent form of
self-indulgence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Innocent self-indulgence? Dear me! You seem to be taking
morality by the throat for a change. Is that your conception of
sin? How should Moses have come to inscribe some particular form of
wrong-doing into his Code, if it had not proved harmful to the
community at large?"</p>

<p>His friend paused before replying. He took out another cigar,
bit off its end, and lighted it. Then he sent a few fragrant whiffs
over the sea. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Moses! I have a clear portrait of Moses in my mind; a clear and
favourable portrait. I imagine him gentle, wise, and tolerant.
Picture to yourself such a man. He is drawing up a preliminary list
of the more noteworthy forms of misconduct, with a view to
submitting it for Divine approval, to be welded later into the
so-called Ten Commandments. He is still puzzling, you perceive,
which sins ought to be included and which left out. Now that
particular offence of which our millionaire is accused happens to
have been left out of consideration so far."</p>

<p>"Why has it been left out?" enquired the bishop.</p>

<p>"Nomadic habits. And besides&mdash;Moses, don't forget, is a
kindly old fellow, who likes people to have as much harmless
amusement as possible; he is not always sniffing about to discover
evil. But Aaron, or some other old family friend of his, thinks
differently. He is a person such as we all know&mdash;a sour-faced
puritan who has lost the vigour which people, rightly or wrongly,
attribute to van Koppen. This man forgets what he used to do in his
own youthful days; he comes up to Moses, professing to be horrified
at this particular offence. 'These young people,' he says, 'the way
they go on! It's a sin, that's what it is. And you, Moses, I'm
ashamed of you. This sort of thing ought to be stopped. It ought to
be publicly reprimanded in those blessed Tables of yours.' 'A sin?'
says gentle Moses. 'You surprise me, Aaron. I confess it never
struck me in that light before. But I think I see your point. We
have a conference to-night on the Holy Mountain; I may be able to
get a clause inserted&mdash;' 'Do, there's a good fellow,' says the
other. 'But aren't you a little hard on the youngsters?' asks
Moses. 'You wouldn't believe it, but I was a boy myself once and I
should have got into a lot of rows if such an enactment had been in
existence then. Moreover (and here his eyes assume a rapt,
prophetic look) I seem to see, rising out of the distant future, a
personage of royal line, beloved of God&mdash;one David who, if
your proposal were to come into force, would be classed as a pretty
hot sinner,' 'Oh, bother David! Look here, I'm not asking for a
loan of money, old man. Just see to it that my New Sin is inscribed
on the Tables. Hang it all! What's that, to a man of your influence
up there? You can't think how it annoys me nowadays to see all
these young people&mdash;all these young people&mdash;need I go
into particulars?' 'You needn't. I'm not altogether a fool,' says
gentle Moses. 'And I'll see what I can do to oblige you, if only
for the sake of your dear mother.'"</p>

<p>The bishop, at the end of this narration, could not help
smiling.</p>

<p>"That," continued Keith, "is how Moses gets talked over by the
Pharisees. That is how sins are manufactured and classified. And
from that preposterous old Hebrew system of right and wrong they
jump straight into our English penal code. And there they sit
tight," he added.</p>

<p>"Is that your quarrel with what you call the upstairs god
system?"</p>

<p>"Precisely! It affects me by its unsanitary tendency to multiply
sins; that is to say, when it transforms those sins into legal
crimes. How would you like to be haled before a Court of law for
some ridiculous trifle, which became a crime only because it used
to be a sin, and became a sin only because some dyspeptic old
antediluvian was envious of his neighbour's pleasure? Our
statute-book reeks of discarded theories of conduct; the serpent's
trail of the theologian, of the reactionary, is over all."</p>

<p>"It never struck me in that light before," said Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"No? Our reverence for inspired idiots: has it never struck you?
Don't you realize that we are still in the stage of that <i>enfant
terrible</i> of Christianity, Paul of Tarsus, and his gift of
tongues? In the stage of these Russians here, with their decayed
Messiah? What do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"I must say they look pretty, all bathing together. Rather
improper. But decidedly apostolic. You know I am not easily shocked
in such matters. When you have lived in Africa among the M'tezo!
Lovely fellows. I assure you they could give points to anyone on
this island. And your friends the Bulanga! To think that I once
baptized three hundred of them in one day. And the very next week
they ate up old Mrs. Richardson, our best lady preacher. The poor
dear! We buried her riding boots, I remember. There was nothing
else to bury...It's getting warm, isn't it? Makes one feel
sleepy."</p>

<p>"Sleepy? I don't agree with you at all. That Russian sect,
Heard, had between two and three million followers out there. But I
fancy our little contingent will not be on this island much longer.
The judge tells me that he means to make short work of them when he
gets a chance. If the Militia have really been called out, I should
not be surprised to learn that the Messiah has been up to some new
tomfoolery."</p>

<p>"Really? H'm. The Militia...I find it very warm all of a
sudden."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard had listened enough for the time being. Now he leaned
back and rested.</p>

<p>But Keith was wide awake.</p>

<p>"You are a disappointing person, Mr. Heard. First you inveigle
me into a religious discussion and then, when I begin to wake up,
you go to sleep."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to argue, my dear fellow. It's too hot to argue.
I wanted to hear your opinion."</p>

<p>"My opinion? Listen, Heard. All mankind is at the mercy of a
handful of neurotics. Neurotics and their catchwords. Catchwords
like duty, charity, purity, sobriety. Sobriety! In order that Miss
Wilberforce may not come home drunk&mdash;listen, Heard!&mdash;all
we other lunatics forgo the pleasure of a pint of beer after ten
o'clock. How we love tormenting ourselves! Listen, Heard. I'll tell
you what it is. We are ripe for a new Messiah, like these Russians.
We are not Europeans. We are Indian fakirs, self-torturers. We are
a pack of masochists. That is what upstairs gods have done for us.
Listen, Heard!"</p>

<p>The bishop failed to catch the import of this peroration. Its
sound alone reached him like an echo from far away. He was
unaccountably drowsy.</p>

<p>"Fakirs. I quite understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boat seemed to move more slowly than before. Perhaps the
oarsmen were weary, or suffering from the heat. The glare pierced
the awning. Mr. Heard, as he reclined about his cushions, felt the
perspiration gathering on his forehead. A spell had fallen upon
him&mdash;the spell of a Southern noon. It lulled his senses. It
laid chains upon his thoughts.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken only by the splash of the oars
and by a steady flow of conversation on the part of the two Greek
genii, who seemed impervious to the midday beams and entirely
absorbed in one another. Mr. Heard opened his drooping eyelids from
time to time to take pleasure in their merry play of feature,
wondering dreamily what could be the subject-matter of this endless
polite conversation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c26.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Both the old boatman and Mr. Keith were correct in their
surmises. There was trouble in the market-place, serious trouble;
so serious that for the first time in five years&mdash;ever since
that deplorable scandal of the Irish lady and the poodle&mdash;the
Militia were being called out. And it was entirely the fault of the
Sacred Sixty-three.</p>

<p>The Messiah, personally, was not to blame. That poor old man had
much declined of late; he was enfeebled in health and spirits. A
French artist who was specially despatched from Paris to do an
original sketch of him for the enterprising journal
<i>L'Illustration</i> had, at the end of several sittings,
uncharitably declared him to be "<i>compltement ga-ga</i>." The
voluptuous surroundings of Nepenthe, the abundant food, adoration
of disciples, alcoholic and carnal debaucheries, had impaired his
tough Monjik frame and blunted his wit, working havoc with that
energy and peasant craftiness which once ruled an Emperor's Court.
His body was obese. His mind was in a state of advanced
putrefaction. Even his personal cleanliness left something to be
desired. Sitting there, puffy and pasty, in a darkened room, he
looked more than ever like some obscene vegetable that has grown up
in the shade.</p>

<p>He moved seldom and with difficulty; he hardly ever opened his
mouth save to eat&mdash;for his appetite, thanks to certain daily
exertions on the part of the communal doctor, was still fairly
satisfactory. When he spoke at all it was in scattered
monosyllables which even the most devoted of his disciples were
unable to arrange into such coherence as to justify their inclusion
in the <i>Golden Book</i>. All this, though hidden from the world
at large, had been observed with dismay by the initiated. It was an
open secret among them that the last twenty-one sayings ascribed to
him in that volume had never issued from his lips at all. They had
been concocted by a clique of young extremists, who were now
masters of the situation. These fanatics edited the <i>Golden
Book</i> and held the old man completely in subjection, ousting his
former and more moderate collaborators.</p>

<p>An ill-considered action on the part of this group led to the
disaster and eclipsed the light of holiness on Nepenthe by bringing
the apostles into conflict with the secular arm of the law.
Fretting at the Master's prolonged inactivity and eager, after the
fashion of disciples, to improve on his maxims, they decided on a
bold step. They decided that the time was ripe for a new
Revelation.</p>

<p>The Messiah's last authentic one, it will be remembered, ran to
the effect that "flesh and blood of warm-blooded beast is
Abomination to Little White Cows." He had been inspired to insert
the word <i>warm-blooded</i> because fish, for example, was an
article of diet of which he was inordinately fond, and he could not
bring himself to deprive the faithful of this gift of God.</p>

<p>With misplaced zeal, and little thinking that it would cost many
of them their lives and liberties, these enthusiasts gave it out
that the new Revelation ran as follows: "everything derivable from
dead beasts is Abomination to Little White Cows." They had been
inspired to insert the word <i>dead</i> because sheep's wool, for
example, was an article of clothing in which they greatly
delighted, and they could not bring themselves to deprive the
faithful of this gift of God.</p>

<p>Even as it stood, the Commandment entailed severe sacrifices on
the part of the Sacred Sixty-three. No boot-leather, no picturesque
belts, no bone knife-handles or combs, no tallow candles...They
were prepared, none the less, to carry out to the letter this
injunction, since it gave them what all religious people
require&mdash;something to torment themselves with; and this is how
matters stood when, on that morning, a stalwart batch of new-comers
from the wilds of Muscovy, burning with the ardour of abnegation
and wholly ignorant of local laws and customs, sauntered across the
market-place in freshly purchased hempen sandals.</p>

<p>Tobacco being derivable neither from warm-blooded beasts nor yet
from dead ones, a member of the band bethought himself of the fact
that he had run out of cigarettes. Knowing not a word of Italian he
entered the shop of a tobacconist and imitated the gesture of
smoking with such success that the proprietor straightway
understood and supplied him with a packet. Then he remembered that
he also needed matches. This called for a gesture rather more
complex; so complex, indeed, that perhaps nobody but a
Nepenthean&mdash;gifted, as all his nation is, with alert
intuition&mdash;could have divined the Apostle's want. The
tobacconist was equal to the occasion. With a friendly smile of
comprehension he laid on the counter a diminutive pack of wax
vestas, price two sous.</p>

<p>There the matter might have rested but for the new Revelation,
which prompted the sturdy stranger to investigate the composition
of the article tendered. He took out one match and examined it
carefully. Then, triturating its substance between his fingers, he
applied his nose to the product and sniffed critically. The outcome
was suspicious in the highest degree. There was no perceptible
odour of beeswax; the object had been compounded, only too plainly,
of the fat of dead animals; it was the Abomination, the Unclean
Thing. Devout, and gifted with the hot impulse of youth, he acted
precisely as he would have acted in Russia under a similar
provocation. With a third gesture, one of abhorrence and
ungovernable fury, he threw the box in the tobacconist's face.</p>

<p>And there the matter, once more, might have rested, had the
salesman been a Russian. Russians understand frank dealing.</p>

<p>He happened to be a native.</p>

<p>Fully to appreciate what followed, it is necessary to bear in
mind that local tobacconists are in a somewhat anomalous position.
They occupy a social status superior to those of many other
countries. They are not private merchants or ordinary citizens;
they are, in a manner, servants of the State. A native tobacconist
is empowered to dispense <i>carta bollata</i>, which is the
official stamped paper used for contracts and other legal documents
requiring registration; he deals in tobacco and postage
stamps&mdash;government monopolies; he sells, by special licence,
wax vestas, on each box of which there is a duty so minute as not
to be felt by the individual purchaser and yet, in its cumulative
effect, so great as to enable the State to pay, out of this source
of revenue alone, for the upkeep of all its colonial judges at a
monthly salary of forty-five francs apiece. It is a reasonable tax.
Don Francesco, who had notions of political economy and knew
something of English life, having preached to thousands of Catholic
miners in Wales and confessed hundreds of Catholic ladies in
Mayfair&mdash;an occupation in which he might still be engaged, but
for a little <i>contretemps</i> which brought him into collision
with the Jesuits of Mount Street&mdash;Don Francesco, who could
voice the Southerner's one-sided point of view, often adverted to
this match-tax when proving the superiority of his country's
administrative methods over those of England. This is what he would
say to his intimate friends:</p>

<p>"The Russian has convictions but no principles. The Englishman
has principles but no convictions&mdash;cast-iron principles, which
save him the trouble of thinking out anything for himself. This is
as much as anyone can ever hope to grasp concerning this lymphatic,
unimaginative race. They obey the laws&mdash;a criminal requires
imagination. They never start a respectable revolution&mdash;you
cannot revolt without imagination. Among other things they pride
themselves on their immunity from vexatious imposts. Yet whisky,
the best quality of which is worth tenpence a bottle, is taxed till
it costs five shillings; ale, the life-blood of the people, would
be dear at three-pence a gallon and yet costs fivepence a pint;
tobacco, which could profitably be sold at twopence a pound, goes
for fivepence an ounce. They will submit to any number of these
extortions, being persuaded, in the depths of their turbid
intelligence, that such things are devised for the good of the
nation at large. That is the Englishman's method of procuring
happiness: to deny himself pleasure in order to save his
neighbour's soul. Ale and tobacco are commodities out of which a
man can extract pleasure. They are therefore appropriate objects
for harassing restrictions. But nobody can extract pleasure out of
lucifer matches. They are therefore pre-eminently unfitted for
exploitation as a source of governmental revenue. So keen is their
sense of pleasure and non-pleasure, and such is their <i>furor
phlegmaticus</i> on this particular question, that when it is
proposed to establish a tax on matches&mdash;an imperceptible duty
which would enrich the Exchequer to a vast extent&mdash;they will
form a procession ten miles long to protest against the outrage,
and threaten to batter down the Houses of Parliament. Why? Because
there is no ethical purpose to be served by taxing matches, seeing
that only a madman would give himself the guilty pleasure of either
drinking or smoking them. In short, these English reason after the
fashion of paranoiacs&mdash;logically, but from a wrong premise.
Not that I dislike their women..."</p>

<p>The action of the quick-tempered Apostle can now be appraised in
its full enormity. A local tobacconist is a person in authority, a
State official, and the nation safeguards the interests and the
fair name of those who serve it faithfully. When it is remembered
that according to sect 43 of the 16th Section of their Penal Code
any person speaking disrespectfully to, or of, a Government
official renders himself liable to a term of cellular confinement
not exceeding thirty-one years, ten lunar months and eighteen days,
it may be imagined what penalties are applicable to the crime of
actual personal violence towards such a sacrosanct
individual&mdash;a crime of which the Russian was unquestionably
guilty.</p>

<p>Now this particular tobacconist, though tremulously sensitive,
like all Southerners, on a point of honour, was as good-natured and
forgiving as might be consistent with his rank of Government
official. He passed for a respectable married man with an eligible
daughter and a taste for the quiet life; he did not want trouble.
The purchase of an additional pack of cigarettes, accompanied or
unaccompanied by a frank apology, would have more than satisfied
his sense of honour.</p>

<p>There the matter might have rested. The second packet might have
been bought and even the apology tendered, but for the
ill-considered action of a young farmer who entered the shop at
that moment to procure a couple of postcards. This worthy lad was
one of several dozen aspirants to the hand of the tobacconist's
daughter, whose dowry was reputed to be considerable. He witnessed
the insult and, desirous of standing well in the graces of a
prospective father-in-law, dealt the offending alien so masterly a
punch in the region of the solar plexus that he not only doubled
up, but forgot to straighten himself out again. Two or three lusty
Apostles came to the rescue without delay. They threw the youth
down, stamped on his face, pounded his abdomen, pulled his hair out
in handfuls, and otherwise treated him exactly as if the thing were
happening in Russia. This spectacle was too much for the
tobacconist's sense of honour. With unwonted sprightliness he
vaulted over the writhing cluster and summoned a municipal
policeman. The officer was on the spot in a twinkling, sword and
trumpet in hand. And there, in all conscience, the matter ought to
have rested&mdash;with the identification and bestowal in custody
of the turbulent parties.</p>

<p class="caption">The Fracas</p>

<p>But frenzy hung in the air; a red cloud of insanity was hovering
over Nepenthe. Although the volcano continued to behave in
exemplary fashion, although the clergy had done their utmost to
allay popular apprehensions, the native mind had not calmed down
since the news concerning the Saint Elias fountain and those other
portents had been disseminated. The inhabitants were in a state of
suppressed alarm and ready, at the least provocation, to burst out
into some fiendish act of folly. And the Russians, especially those
latest arrivals, could not withdraw themselves from the subtle
influence of the sound wind, the frank stimulation of a cloudless
sky; it made them fell, after their gloomy forests and lowering
horizons, like wild beasts that rush from darkened cages into some
sunny arena. Everyone lost his wits. The appearance of a constable,
far from restoring order, was the signal for an uproarious tumult;
the <i>fracas</i>, as the French artist was heard to declare,
promptly developed into a <i>mle</i>. Nobody troubled about the
merits of the case further than that it was a question of Apostles
<i>versus</i> Gentiles.</p>

<p>The former were in sad minority. But they constituted a serried
rank of muscular Christians; they laid about them like those old
monks of Alexandria. All Russians are born fighters&mdash;if not on
the battlefield, then at least in the lanes and taverns of their
natal villages. The Little White Cows, wholly ignorant of the
difference between their own law and that of Italy on questions of
assault and battery, used their fists with such success that thirty
natives were stretched out in almost a few seconds. Their Faith was
at stake; moreover, and as a matter of fact, they were enjoying
themselves hugely. The occasion reminded them of a Sunday at
home.</p>

<p>Then numbers began to tell&mdash;numbers and knives. For your
sun-scorched Nepenthean, when duly roused, confesses to an expert
knowledge of anatomy; he can tell you, to the fraction of an inch,
where the liver, the spleen, kidneys and various other coy organs
of the human frame are located. Blood, the blood of the Sacred
Sixty-three, began to flow. At that sight the women, as their
manner is, set up a scream.</p>

<p>The Palace of Justice abutted on the market-place, and up to
that moment His Worship Signor Malipizzo might have been lost to
the world, so deeply immersed was he in threading the labyrinthine
mazes of an exceptionally intricate affiliation case&mdash;a warm
document, after his own heart. The sound of the scream suspended
his labours. Like a gouty parrot he hopped down from his seat of
judgment, spat on the floor, limped to the window and took in the
situation at a glance. That is to say, he understood the cause of
the disturbance as little as did any one else; it would have
required a divine inspiration to guess that a box of wax vestas was
at the bottom of the affair; but he knew enough, quite enough, more
than enough, for the purpose at hand. He knew, to begin with, that
Apostles were involved in the brawl. He knew, what was equally
important, the provisions of the Penal Code. It sufficed. His
chance for dealing with the Russian colony had at last arrived.
Allowing himself barely time to smack his lips at this providential
interlude he gave orders for the great cannon of Duke Alfred to be
sounded. It boomed once or twice over Nepenthe and reverberated
among the rocks.</p>

<p>In times of yore a certain interval was wont to elapse before
the Militia could be assembled, living as they did in distant
regions of the island. But nowadays, as befitted a laborious rural
population, they were spending their morning in the wine-shops of
the town, gambling, drinking, or playing skittles. This enabled a
sufficient number of them to forgather, in an incredibly short
space of time, at the outskirts of the market-place (occupied by a
seething, howling tangle of humanity)&mdash;there to receive the
plainest of instructions. They were to quell the disorder and to
single out for punishment, whenever possible, the strangers, the
obvious authors of the rebellion, easily discernible by their
scarlet blouses. Not that the judge was particular about the lives
or deaths of a few natives; he knew that any injuries received by
his countrymen would strengthen his case against the outsiders. But
an order couched in such terms would look well in the records of
the Court.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes the market-place was cleared. The Militia had
used their weapons with such precision that four school children,
seven women, eleven islanders, and twenty-six Apostles were
wounded&mdash;about half of them, it was believed, mortally. Order
reigned in Nepenthe.</p>

<p>The warm affiliation case having been laid on ice for the nonce,
the next few minutes were occupied by His Worship in issuing
warrants of arrest against the Messiah's followers. They were
lodged by batches in gaol, and in supplementary gaols&mdash;disused
cellars and so forth. Once under lock and key they were safe from
mischief for an indefinite length of time, since according to the
statutes of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no reason on
earth why an Italian lawsuit should ever end, or indeed, why it
should ever begin. They might, and probably would, remain
incarcerated for life, pending the commencement of a trial which
could only be set in motion by the judge himself&mdash;a most
improbable conjuncture&mdash;or, failing that, by an extravagant
bribe to his official superior, the President of the Court of
Cassation. How were poor Apostles to find the necessary sixty or
seventy francs for such a venture?</p>

<p>His Worship retired to luncheon, reasonably satisfied with the
morning's work. And yet not altogether delighted. Both the Messiah
and Peter the Great had eluded his wrath. Peter was able to prove,
beyond the shadow of a doubt, that he had spent the last
twenty-four hours on Madame Steynlin's premises and knew nothing
whatever of occurrences in the outside world. In the face of such a
fact&mdash;so comfortable to common knowledge, so inherently
probable&mdash;Malipizzo gave way. He was too good a lawyer to
spoil his case. Sooner or later, he foresaw, that bird would be
caged with the rest of them. Regarding the Messiah, an unexpected
and breathless appeal for mercy was lodged by the Communal doctor,
atheist and freemason like the judge, who implored, with tears in
his eyes, that the warrant for his arrest should be rescinded. By
means of a sequence of rapid and intricate Masonic signs, he
explained that Bazhakuloff was a patient of his; that he was
undergoing a daily treatment with the stomach-pump; that the prison
diet being notoriously slender, he feared that if he, the Messiah,
were confined in captivity, than it, the stomach-pump, would be no
longer required and therefore he, the physician, a family man,
deprived of a small but regular source of income. Again the astute
judge relented. This is how the Messiah and his disciple
escaped.</p>

<p>They escaped, but not for long.</p>

<p>And all this happened while Mr. Keith and his companion,
drowsily ensconced among the morocco cushions of their boat, were
being wafted over the blue sea, far away, under the cliffs.</p>

</p>

<p>"The Devil's Rock, gentlemens! The rock of the Devil. Where the
young English lord jump over. Everyone know that story."</p>

<p>The word "devil" caused the bishop to wake up from his pleasant
dreams with something of a start.</p>

<p>"You had better take a good look at that cliff," suggested Mr.
Keith. "It is not only the finest on the island but, I fancy, the
finest on the whole Mediterranean. Those on the Spanish coast and
on Mount Athos lack the wonderful colour and the clean surface of
this one. Looks as if it had been done with a knife, doesn't it?
Alpine crags seem vertical but are nearly always inclined; their
primary rock, you know, cannot flake off abruptly like this tufa.
This is a genuine precipice. Plumb!"</p>

<p>"Terrific," said Mr. Heard. "What was that about the English
lord?"</p>

<p>"Two young fellows who rented the villa at the back of it for a
summer. They used to bathe and booze all day long. I was not on the
island at the time, but of course I heard about it. One day the
younger one jumped over the edge of the cliff for a bet; said he
was going to dive. They never recovered his body. There is a strong
current at this point. That's so, isn't it, Antonio?"</p>

<p>"That so, gentlemens. Drink branty all the time, both of them.
But little one&mdash;everybody smile at him. Pretty boy. Swim and
dive, something lovely. One evening both get drunk and walk along
the edge of cliff up there. Then little one, he say: I good diver,
eh, what, friend? Big one say: You dive prettier than
dolphin.&mdash;What bet, over cliff here, now?&mdash;Six bottle
branty.&mdash;Done! Clothes off, over he go, like a sea-bird. All
finished. That so, gentlemens. Next morning they bring clothes to
big one into house. Big one, when he wake up and see clothes lying
there, with no friend inside, he very angry with servants and
everybody else, and drink no more branty for three days. Dam-fool
foreigners."</p>

<p>"That's a tragedy, anyhow," said the bishop.</p>

<p>"You are right. It is quite artistic&mdash;that touch about
bringing back the clothes, the empty shell, next morning. Quite
artistic."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard looked up at the crag. It made him dizzy to picture
some human body hurtling through the air from that awful height.
Its surface was of perfect smoothness. But what struck him even
more was the uncommon and almost menacing coloration. The rock was
bluish black, spattered with maculations of a ruddy sanguine tint,
as though drops of blood had oozed out, in places, from its stony
heart.</p>

<p>"I remember Mrs. Meadows telling me that story," he said to
Keith. "Isn't her villa at the back?"</p>

<p>"The very place. By the way, when next you call, would you
please say something particularly nice <i>de ma part</i>? I don't
see half enough of that lady, considering how much I like her. How
is she?"</p>

<p>"Complains of headache."</p>

<p>"Headache? That is very unlike Mrs. Meadows. I always look upon
her as a bundle of steel springs. Perhaps something is wrong with
the baby."</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied the bishop. "She seems to dote on it."</p>

<p>Then that last visit to his cousin suddenly recurred to him; he
remembered her conversation&mdash;he thought of the lonely woman up
thee. Strange! Somehow or other, she had been at the back of his
mind all the time. He decided to call again in a day or two.</p>

<p>Keith said:</p>

<p>"I should not like to come between her and the child. That woman
is a tiger&mdash;mother...Heard, there has been something in your
mind all day long. What is it?"</p>

<p>"I believe there has. I'll try to explain. You know those
Japanese flowers&mdash;" he began, and then broke off.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are becoming terrestrial at last. Nothing like
Mother Earth! You cannot think how much money I wasted on Japanese
plants, especially bulbs, before I convinced myself that they
cannot be grown on this soil."</p>

<p>"Those paper flowers, I mean, which we used to put in our
finger-bowls at country dinner tables. They look like shrivelled
specks of cardboard. But in the water they begin to grow larger and
to unfold themselves into unexpected patterns of flowers of all
colours. That is how I feel&mdash;expanding, and taking on other
tints. New problems, new influences, are at work upon me. It is as
if I needed altogether fresh standards. Sometimes I feel almost
ashamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ashamed? My dear Heard, this will never do. You must take a
blue pill when we get home."</p>

<p>"Can it be the south wind?"</p>

<p>"Everybody blames the poor sirocco. I imagine you have long been
maturing for this change, unbeknown to yourself. And what does it
mean? Only that you are growing up. Nobody need be ashamed of
growing up... Here we are, at last! We will land at the little
beach yonder, near the end of that gulley. You can go ashore and
have a look at the old thermal establishment. It used to be a gay
place with a theatre and ballrooms and banqueting rooms. Nobody
dare enter it nowadays. Haunted! Perhaps you will see the ghost. As
for me, I mean to take a swim. I always feel as if I needed a bath
after talking about religion. You don't mind my saying so, do
you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, climbing upwards from the beach, felt as though he
did not mind what anyone said about anything.</p>

<p>With the Devil's Rock the most imposing tract of Nepenthean
cliff&mdash;scenery came to an abrupt end. That mighty escarpment
was its furthest outpost. Thereafter the land fell seawards no
longer precipitously, but in wavy earthen slopes intersected by
ravines which the downward-rushing torrents of winter had washed
out of the loose soil. It was at the termination of one of these
dry stream-beds that Mr. Heard set foot on shore. Panting under the
relentless heat he wound his way along a path once carefully tended
and engineered, but now crumbling to decay.</p>

<p>Before him, on a treeless brown eminence, silhouetted against
the blue sky, stood the ruin. It was a fanciful woe-begone
structure, utterly desolate. The plaster, gnawed away by winds
laden with searching sea-moisture, had fallen to earth, exposing
the underlying masonry of cheap construction whose rusty colour was
the same as that of the ground from which it had arisen, and into
which it now seemed ready and eager to descend. Everything useful
or portable, everything that spoke of man's occupation, everything
that suggested life and comfort&mdash;the porcelain tiles,
woodwork, window-panes, roofings, mosaic or marble floors, leaden
pipes&mdash;all this had been carried away long ago. It stood there
stark, dismantled, de-humanized, in the midday heat. Here was
nothing to charm the eye or conjure up visions of past glory;
nothing elegant or romantic; nothing savouring of grim warlike
purposes. It was a modern ruin; a pile of rubbish; a shameless,
frivolous skeleton. Those hastily built walls and staring windows
wore an air of faded futility, almost of indecency&mdash;as though
the mouldering bones of some long-forgotten lady of pleasure had
crept out of their tomb to give themselves an airing in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, after glancing at what remained of a pretentious
facade, stepped within.</p>

<p>Deep shade was here, in those of the chambers whose roofs
remained intact; shade, and a steamy heat, and the noxious odour of
some mineral product&mdash;the healing waters. He strayed in the
twilight through halls and corridors, past ample saloons and rows
of cells which had apparently served for convenience of disrobing.
Everywhere that noisome smell accompanied his footsteps; the place
was reeking with it. And all was in decay. Gaudy paper hung in
tatters from the ceilings; the dust lay thick, undisturbed for
generations. Unclean things littered in musty corners. Through
gaping skylights a sunny beam would penetrate; it played about the
mildewy stucco partitions encrusted, in patches, with a poisonous
lichen of bright green. Wandering about this dank and mournful pile
of wreckage, he could understand why simple folks should dread to
enter so ghoul-haunted a spot.</p>

<p>Gladly he issued, by way of an obscure passage, into what had
once been a trim garden. No trace of flowers or shrubs remained;
the walks, the ornamental stone seats and artificial terraces, were
merging into brown earth. Here, in the centre of this ruined
pleasaunce, the health-giving fountain had lately flowed, bubbling
up in a couch-shaped basin of cement. It was now dry. But a damp
warmth still clung to its rim, whereon the mineral had left a
comely deposit of opaline texture. Lowering his hand he felt an
intermittent stream of hot air rising out of the ground, feeble as
the breath of a dying man. Still some mysterious gusts of life down
there, he concluded, in the dark earth. How curious that volcanic
connection with the mainland, of which Count Caloveglia had
spoken!</p>

<p>Soon he found himself beside the shattered framework of a small
pavilion, built in a grotesque Chinese style and looking woefully
out of place in this classic landscape, with the blue Tyrrhenian at
its foot. And here he rested. He surveyed the traces of the old
path leading down from the higher lands in serpentine meanderings;
that path&mdash;once, doubtless, bordered by shady
trees&mdash;whereby all those worldly invalids had once descended.
He pictured the lively caravan afoot, on mule-back, in sedan
chairs, seeking health and pleasure at this site, now so void of
life. Lower down, almost within a stone's throw, lay the beach. The
sailors, father and son, had drawn the boat up to the shore and
were sitting huddled up on its shady side, with some food between
them on a coloured handkerchief. That Brobdingnagian
luncheon-basket had also been disembarked. Keith was swimming,
together with his two genii; he looked like a rosy Silenus. They
seemed to be enjoying themselves vastly, to judge by the outbursts
of laughter. Mr. Heard thought of going to join the fun, but gave
up the idea; there was something astir that clogged his
energies.</p>

<p>He knew them&mdash;these Southern noons. If no ghost resided in
the melancholy ruin hard by, there might well be some imponderable
hostile essence afloat in the still air of midday. Anything, he
felt, could happen at this unearthly hour. The wildest follies
might be committed at the bidding of this unseen Presence.</p>

<p>He tried to recollect what Keith had told him concerning Muhlen,
that corrupt personality. Retlow...where had he heard that name
before? In vain he flogged his memory. There was an alien power in
this brightness; a power as of a vampire that drained away his
faculties, his vitality; a spirit of evil, exhaling from the sunny
calm. It made a mock, a mirage, of the landscape which danced
before his eyes; it distorted the realities of nature, the works of
man...</p>

<p>Presently he observed that Keith and his companions were clothed
and occupied in dragging things out of the preposterous
food-receptacle. They called up to him. The spell was released.</p>

<p>He descended.</p>

<p>"Nice bathe?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Rather! And now these fellows will make a passable omelette, to
begin with. I don't fancy cold luncheons, do you? They seem to lie
dead on one's stomach."</p>

<p>"Are those sailors not coming with us?"</p>

<p>"No. They are well paid for their work. No doubt they would like
to be in my service too. But I never employ islanders, except for
casual jobs; it saves me all kinds of local trouble and family
intrigues. Nor yet older people. They are so apt to think; and once
a servant begins to think he ceases to be of use. I believe in the
outsider, for all purposes of human intercourse. If you want a
thing done, go to the outsider, the intelligent amateur. And when
you marry, Heard, be sure to select a wife from another class,
another province, another country&mdash;another planet, if
possible. Otherwise you will repent it. Not that I see any
objection, on principle, to incest; it strikes me as the most
natural proceeding in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me!"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;that inexplicable prejudice. It is probably
artificial and of modern origin. I suspect the priestly caste.
Royal families kept up the custom and do so still, like that of
Siam. Odd, how anachronisms linger longest at the two poles of
society. What do you say," he went on, "to climbing a little up
that gorge, into the shade? I cannot digest properly with the sun
staring at me. And tell me, as we go along, your impressions of the
ruin...I perceive drawbacks to incest; grave practical
drawbacks&mdash;sterility, inbreeding. Yes, there is obviously
something to be said for exogamy. <i>Audi alteram partem</i> as
Eames might say, though God knows why he thinks it sounds better in
Latin. Seen the ghost?"</p>

<p>The bishop remembered a certain answer given him by Madame
Steynlin, to whom he had once spoken of the "tonic" effects of
Keith's conversation.</p>

<p>"A tonic?" she had said. "Very likely! But not a tonic for men
and women. A tonic for horses."</p>

<p>After luncheon they improvised a shelter in order to repose
awhile. It was the right thing to do on Nepenthe at that hour of
the day, and Mr. Keith tried to conform to custom even under
unusual circumstances such as these. Protected by the boat's
scarlet awning from the rays of the sun, they slumbered through the
flaming hours.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c28.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>The duchess was a good sleeper, as befitted a person of regular
habits and pure life.</p>

<p>It was her custom to retire for the night at about eleven
o'clock. Angelina, who reposed in an adjoining room, would enter
softly at nine in the morning, draw up the blinds, and deposit a
cup of tea at the bedside of her mistress. Up to that moment, she
would slumber like a child. Rarely did she suffer from insomnia or
nightmare. On this particular night, however, her rest was troubled
by a strange and disquieting dream.</p>

<p>She was a little girl once more, at her parental home out West.
All the old memories were around her. It was winter time. She was
alone, out of doors. Snow, the familiar snow, was falling from a
sombre sky; already it lay deep on the boundless plains. It fell
without ceasing. The sky grew darker. Hours seemed to pass, and
still the flakes descended. It was not cold snow. It was warm
snow&mdash;warm and rather suffocating. Very suffocating. It began
to choke her. Suddenly she found she could breathe no more. She
gave a wild cry of despair&mdash;</p>

<p>Her maid was standing beside the bed, a lighted candle in her
hand. Otherwise the room was in pitch darkness. Angelina looked
like a Tanagra statuette. Draped in nothing but a clinging
nightgown that reached two inches below the knee and accentuated
the charm of her figure, with the candle-light throwing playful
gleams upon her neck and cheeks, Angelina was an apparition to
gladden the heart of man.</p>

<p>The heart of the Duchess was not gladdened by any means.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, girl?" she enquired sternly, in
what she took to be the language of the country. "And in the middle
of the night!"</p>

<p>"It's nine o'clock, Madam."</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock? Then draw the blinds."</p>

<p>"I've drawn them." She stepped to the window and tapped on the
glass panes by way of confirmation. "All dark outside," she added.
"Ashes are falling from heaven. The volcano is very, very
angry."</p>

<p>"Ashes? The volcano? I must dress at once. Light two more
candles. No, three! We can't have three candles burning. Don
Francesco may be here at any moment."</p>

<p>The Duchess often laughingly described herself as "only a weak
woman." A certain number of persons concurred in that opinion. Just
then she was the most self-possessed inhabitant of Nepenthe. The
disturbance of nature left her undisturbed. Her intellect was
naturally incurious as to the habits of volcanoes; her soul,
moreover, in good hands, her conscience in excellent working order,
as befitted a potential convert to Catholicism. She could rely on a
spiritual adviser who had instilled into her mind a lofty sense of
obedience and resignation. Don Francesco would never desert her. He
would arrive in due course, explaining why God had allowed the
volcano to behave in this unseemly fashion, and brimming over with
words of consolation for his daughter-to-be. God, if so disposed,
could work a miracle and drive away the plague, even as he had sent
it. Ashes or no ashes, all was for the best. Calmly she waited.</p>

<p>Out of doors, meanwhile, the shower went on without ceasing. It
had begun shortly after midnight; the ground was covered to the
depth of two inches. Nepenthe lay veiled in Cimmerian gloom, darker
than starless midnight&mdash;a darkness that could be felt; a
blanket, as it were, hot and breathless, weighing upon the
landscape. All was silent. No footfall could be heard in the
streets; the powdery ashes, softer than snow, absorbed every sound.
And still they fell. Those few scared natives whom necessity forced
to go abroad crept about in fear of their lives. They thought the
end of the world had come. Terror-stricken, they carried knives and
revolvers in their pockets; they passed each other distrustfully in
the streets holding, in one hand, a lighted torch or lantern, and
in the other a handkerchief pressed to the face for fear of
suffocation. In one or two of the shop windows could be discerned a
light glimmering feebly as through the thickest fog. All the
ordinary sights and sounds of morning&mdash;the vehicles plying for
hire, the cracking of whips, the cries of the fish and fruit
vendors&mdash;all were gone. The deathly stillness was broken only
by a clangour of the town clock, tolling the hours into a darkened
world.</p>

<p>Half a dozen adventurous spirits had gathered together at the
Club. They called themselves adventurous. As a matter of fact they
were scared out of their wits and had gone there merely with a view
to leaning on each other for mutual support and courage. There was
no whisky drinking that morning, no cards, no scandal-mongering.
They sat round a table under an acetylene lamp, anxiously listening
to a young professor from Christiania who claimed to be versed in
the higher mathematics and was then occupied in calculating, by
means of the binomial theorem, how long it would take for the whole
town of Nepenthe to be submerged under ashes up to the
roofs&mdash;presuming all the buildings to be of equal height. He
was a new-comer to the place and, for that reason, rather a
cheerful pessimist. He thought it quite possible that before the
second floors of the houses had been reached&mdash;granted, of
course, that none was higher or lower than the other&mdash;the wind
might change and carry the ashes elsewhere. His demonstration had a
depressing effect on the hearts of those who had lived longer on
the island. They rose from the table and sadly shook their heads,
prepared for the worst. They knew their sirocco.</p>

<p>As morning wore on other stragglers entered the premises,
muffled up to the ears; they scattered ashes from their cloaks and
hastily closed the door behind them. More lamps were lighted. The
news was not inspiring. It was dark as ever outside; you could not
see your hand before your face; the shower had accumulated to an
alarming extent. Some roofs had fallen in under the weight of
ashes; telegraphic communication with the mainland was interrupted
owing, it was supposed, to the snapping of the cable in some
submarine convulsion; a man had stumbled in the market-place over
the dead body of a woman&mdash;choked, no doubt; two of the judge's
Russian prisoners, unaccustomed to volcanic phenomena, had gone
stark staring mad and disembowelled one another with a carving
knife. Mr. Muhlen, who presently turned up in anything but his
usual sprightly humour, was furnished with a full and corrected
version of this last affair, to the effect that there were not two,
but fourteen, of these victims; that prior to their frenzied act
they had partaken of bread and salt and sung the national anthem;
that the instrument chosen was not a carving knife but a rusty
chisel. None of his listeners seemed to be greatly moved by what,
under ordinary circumstances, would have been a valuable
contribution to the entertainment. They were waiting for the
appearance of their president, the Commissioner, the life and soul
of the place, who would be able to give them an official apology
for this scandalous outbreak of nature. The Commissioner, for once
in his life, failed to perform his duty.</p>

<p>That unfortunate man was sitting at home, in the remote villa
known as the "Residency," profoundly troubled in mind. He leaned
over his study table, which was lighted by a lamp; his eyes peered
dejectedly, through the windows beyond, into the gloom. Before him
lay the skeleton draft of his annual report to the Nicaraguan
Minister of Finance, a gentleman who developed a passionate
craving, once a year, to be informed of the condition of Nepenthe
in regard to matters such as shipping and trade returns, zymotic
diseases, and the methods locally employed for combating
beri-beri.</p>

<p>The elaboration of this report had hitherto given Mr. Freddy
Parker no trouble whatever. It was an understood thing between
himself and his protector, Senor Pomponio de Vergara y Puyarola,
that his labours need not be otherwise than purely formal. To every
one of the intelligent queries on the part of a paternal government
it had been his custom, therefore, to append the magic word
<i>nil</i>. Banking system&mdash;<i>nil</i>. Meat
export&mdash;<i>nil</i>. Cotton industry&mdash;<i>nil</i>.
Agriculture&mdash;<i>nil</i>. Canal traffic&mdash;<i>nil</i>. Teak
trade&mdash;<i>nil</i>. Emery mines&mdash;<i>nil</i>.
Fisheries&mdash;<i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>He could trust Senor de Vergara to arrange matters, in the event
of any complaint arising as to the unwarranted ambiguity or
succinctness of the Nepenthean Report.</p>

<p>Bad news had just reached him; very bad news indeed. His friend
and protector had been stabbed to death, after the approved fashion
of Nicaraguan politicians, by a couple of assassins in the pay of
that minister's rival, a bankrupt tradesman who, desirous of
bettering his fortunes, conceived that he would make as good a
Finance Minister as anyone else and had, in fact, already usurped
that post. Worse news could hardly be imagined. The prognosis was
most unfavourable. For Mr. Parer shrewdly argued that a rival of
the late Don Pomponio would look askance at those whom His
Excellency had exalted&mdash;at himself, for instance. And what
then? However conscientiously he might henceforward edit the
report, he realized that his position was no longer secure; he was
liable to be recalled at any moment&mdash;to cede his place to some
candidate of the opposing faction. Those damned republics! Or the
post, being a purely honorary one created expressly for himself by
the obliging and now defunct Don Pomponio, might be permanently
abolished. It was not a pleasant prospect. Mr. Freddy Parker was
rather too old to start knocking about the world again. He was
losing what he called his "nerve." What was to be done?</p>

<p>He tugged at his beard and puffed furious clouds of smoke out of
his briar pipe. He thought of another grief&mdash;another source of
anxiety. The quarterly remissions forwarded to him by certain
obscure but respectable relatives in England, under the condition
that he should never again set foot in that land of honest men, had
not arrived. It was two weeks overdue. What had happened? Had they
decided to cancel it? They had threatened to do so ere now. And if
so, how was he going to live? It was a facer, that was. The
equivalent of fifteen pounds sterling was urgently necessary at
that very moment. Fifteen pounds. Who would lend him fifteen
pounds? Keith? Not likely. Keith was a miser&mdash;a Scotchman, ten
to one. Koppen? He had once already tried to touch him for a loan,
with discouraging results. A most unsympathetic millionaire. Almost
offensive, the older bounder had been. Perhaps somebody had let on
about that bit of <i>crpe de Chine</i> preserved at the Residency,
and its uses as a sociological document. How things got about on
Nepenthe! Where the Hell, then, was money to come from?</p>

<p>Both these troubles, great in themselves, faded into
insignificance before a new and overwhelming sorrow.</p>

<p>In a room directly overhead lay the dead body of his lady. She
had breathed her last on the previous midday, and it is more than
likely that the noise of the cannon-shots, reverberating through
her chamber, had accelerated her end; not the noise as such, for
she was naturally a rowdy woman and never felt comfortable save in
an atmosphere of domestic explosions and quarrels with servants,
but the noise in its social significance, the noise as
demonstrating to her exhausted consciousness that there was
something wrong, something at the same time of considerable
importance&mdash;something she might never live to comment
on&mdash;happening in the market-place. In other words, it is
highly probable that her death had been hastened by the moral
rather than the physical shock of the noise; by disappointment; by
the bitter reflection that she would never survive to learn what
this new scandal, evidently an interesting one, was about.</p>

<p>The doctor, for reasons which he deemed sufficient, had
recommended a speedy interment; it was fixed for that morning. The
fall of ashes had put the ceremony out of the question. There she
lay. And in the room below sat her bereaved stepbrother,
distractedly gazing out of the window upon the darkness of
Erebus.</p>

<p>It harmonized with the darkness of his mourning trousers, newly
creased but not newly purchased; and of his soul. He saw his
worldly existence menaced&mdash;tottering to its fall. All these
catastrophes, so crushing, so unexpected, filled him with a kind of
primeval terror. Mr. Parker was neither a devout believer nor the
reverse. He was a fool and liable, as such, under the stress of
bodily or mental disturbance, to spasmodic fits of abject fright
which he mistook for religion. An attack of indigestion, the
failure of some pecuniary speculation, the demise of a beloved
stepsister&mdash;these various happenings, so dissimilar to one
another, had yet this feature in common, that they put the fear of
God into the otherwise empty brain of Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>He had been in many tight corners, but never in so tight a
corner as this. Hardly ever. He thought of the lady lying dead
upstairs and all she had done towards establishing and
consolidating their social position; how she had economized for
him, yes, and lied for him&mdash;better, far better, than he could
ever hope to lie. For she possessed that most priceless of all
gifts: she believed her own lies. She looked people straight in the
face and spoke from her heart; a falsehood, before it left her
lips, had grown into a flaming truth. She was a florid, improvident
liar. There was no classical parsimony about her misstatements.
They were copious baroque, and encrusted with pleasing and
unexpected tricks of ornamentation. That tropical redundancy for
which her person was renowned reflected itself likewise in her
temperament&mdash;in nothing more than the exuberance of her
untruths which were poured out in so torrential a flood, with such
burning conviction at the opulence of detail that persons who knew
her well used to stand aghast (Catholics had been known to cross
themselves) at the fertility of her constructive imagination, while
the most hardened sceptics protested that, even if her facts were
wrong, there could be no doubt as to her sincerity, her
ingenuousness. Ah, she was a woman in a thousand! Often had Mr.
Parker sat at her feet, a respectful disciple, listening spellbound
and striving to acquire that secret&mdash;a secret which was, after
all, not so much art as nature. He could never hope to rival her
technique.</p>

<p>That was because he could not look you in the face; because he
disbelieved not only his own lies, but those of other
people&mdash;and not only their lies, but their truths; because he
distrusted everything and everybody, and was duly distrusted in his
turn. Nobody believed a word he said, and some rude persons went so
far as to tell him exactly what they thought of him. They called
him a liar in public and in private. Such experiences are trying to
one's nerve; they end in giving you a shifty look. People who knew
him well never took his word for granted, and the more casual
acquaintance would say that even if his facts were correct now and
then he could not help being a fraud all the same.</p>

<p>And now she was gone, this lady who had saved him from countless
small annoyances, who had given him self-esteem and a kind of
social backbone. He stared into the darkness. Where was money to
come from&mdash;those miserable fifteen pounds, for example? What
would happen?</p>

<p>He almost decided upon praying, only he could not think of
appropriate words in which to appeal for this loan; it might seem
to the Deity a contemptuously small sum, not worth bothering the
angels about. On the other hand he dared not apply for more than he
actually needed&mdash;not to that quarter, at least&mdash;for fear
of being found out. He was always being found out, even by his
earthly creditors. Besides, there lingered at the back of his mind
all the time certain doubts as to the efficacy of applying to God
for money or anything else. The whole thing might be a farce. He
remembered, with pain and grief, that he had already on several
occasions tried the prayer-system, like most other systems. And
alas, the results had invariably been <i>nil</i>...</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c29.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>A visit from His Reverence the <i>parroco</i> was announced.</p>

<p>This heroic priest, accompanied by two acolytes bearing torches,
had braved the downpour of ashes. He never shirked his duty. It was
his duty that morning to confer with Mr. Parker anent the delayed
funeral and other painfully material matters. For the deceased lady
had not deserted the creed of her fathers; she was an ardent
Catholic&mdash;so ardent that she professed great pain at her
stepbrother's alien leanings and had taken considerable trouble to
convert him to her own way of thinking. She used to say, in her
flowery language, that his contumacious attitude towards the true
Faith gnawed at her vitals&mdash;meaning, presumably, that it
annoyed her. Often she pointed out how many social and other
advantages they would gain&mdash;living in a Catholic
country&mdash;if he, too, could bring himself to enter the field of
believers. In vain! The Commissioner had a knack of being
ultra-protestant on such occasions.</p>

<p>Not that he greatly cared to what Church he belonged. But if
nobody made it worth his while&mdash;why, he remained an
Englishman. He knew perfectly well that the <i>parroco</i>, his
lady's confessor, was anxious to do something in the proselytizing
line which might lower the prestige of Don Francesco. And he was
clever enough to realize that, by embracing Catholicism at
Torquemada's hands, he, the Official Representative of Nicaragua,
would be putting a feather in the priest's cap. He was not going to
put a feather in anybody's cap&mdash;not for nothing. It was not
good enough. Some strong leader of nations had once remarked,
"Every man his price." Mr. Parker liked that phrase; he was deeply
convinced of its veracity. He also had his price, and once, in a
moment of extreme financial embarrassment, he had delighted his
stepsister by announcing that he was prepared to consider the
question of conversion. He then named his price. It was a condition
not to be expressed by such terms as a gratified church might have
been able to concede&mdash;by some elevation to a higher sphere of
influence or other worldly favour; it was a figure baldly
commercial, expressible, that is, in pounds, shillings and
pence.</p>

<p>"You've got some cheek, Freddy," was all she could bring herself
to say.</p>

<p>"My dear Lola, he can take it or leave it," the Commissioner had
replied, sulkily.</p>

<p>His Reverence never found himself in the odious dilemma of
either taking it or leaving it, for the lady was wise enough not to
divulge so ignoble a proposition.</p>

<p>But now, while the good priest uttered a few parting platitudes
of condolence, the other was revolving in his mind how
negotiations&mdash;direct negotiations, this time&mdash;could be
opened up. He needed fifteen pounds; well, one might be able to do
a little juggling with the Club money for that part of the
business. It was necessary, above all, to devise some means whereby
the Nicaraguan Government might be induced to keep him at his old
post. Here was Torquemada. How could the fellow be turned to
account?</p>

<p>"The Nuncio!" he suddenly thought. A Catholic republic like
Nicaragua was sure to have a Papal Nuncio whatever that might be;
and if he became a convert to the official faith of that country,
the Nuncio would be delighted and might whisper in the ear of the
President a few words commending his act and requesting that so
good a servant of the Church should not be despoiled of his post.
And if the President, himself a Catholic, could be brought to share
this view, then he, Freddy Parker, could snap his fingers at the
machinations of Senor Vergara's successor.</p>

<p>He decided to show some signs of devotion to what he had been
accustomed to call the grossest of superstitions; to reveal
symptoms of latent Roman proclivities. Grief seemed to have
sharpened his wits, for an inspiration came to him. After the
sordid and melancholy details of the funeral had been discussed yet
again&mdash;it was to take place as soon as ever the state of the
sky would allow of it&mdash;Mr. Parker, pointing to the blackened
world outside, made an oracular remark.</p>

<p>"Something must be done," he said.</p>

<p>His companion agreed, very heartily. But soon he drew a deep
sigh. How could a volcanic eruption be stopped? In other words,
what must be done?</p>

<p>"Let me suggest something, <i>parroco</i>. Why not organize a
procession at once, a penitential procession? Such things take
place during eruptions on the mainland. Why not here?"</p>

<p>It was the most tactful and diplomatic proposal that the
Commissioner had ever made. A thundering good tip, in fact. How
proud his Lola would have been, had she heard him make it! A flash
of inspiration&mdash;and he was actually following it up. The
effect was instantaneous. At the sound of the word "procession" the
other's thin lips relaxed, and into his ferrety eyes there came a
gentler look. He was pleased, infinitely pleased. The Protestant
Commissioner betraying only too plainly the heart of a
Catholic&mdash;that augured well. But difficulties, apparently
insurmountable, presented themselves.</p>

<p>"That thought, Signor Parker, coming from you, gives me pleasure
beyond words. But I question whether a procession can be formed.
Even the priests, most of them, would not care to attend. As to the
populace&mdash;who is going to risk his life in the midst of this
calamity? We might all be choked to death. Not that I would
hesitate to play my becoming part!"</p>

<p>"You know your people&mdash;how inquisitive they are. If you
toll the church bells a certain number are sure to gather in the
market-place in order to learn, even at risk of their lives, what
is happening. When they see a torchlight procession being formed,
you will obtain a sufficient quantity, I feel sure, to carry the
Holy Image of the Saint; and some to spare. Also, I see no reason
why the priests should be present in full strength. Toll the bells,
<i>parroco</i>! You will get your men."</p>

<p>His Reverence was thinking hard. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Your project appeals to me. It does credit to your heart. It
would do credit to our island. I will try to arrange it. But
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean, don't you, if the ashes continue to fall,
notwithstanding our expiatory demonstration? Let me see. There was
that disgraceful tumult in the town yesterday. Saint Dodekanus is
perhaps too deeply vexed against his people to concede them a grace
under such circumstances. I imagine him to be very displeased with
us just now. That being the case, the fall of ashes might well be
permitted to continue for our castigation, despite the penitential
act. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Nobody knows what the <i>parroco</i> thought. It was not his
habit to think aloud, much less to express opinions on ticklish
arguments such as these. But he could corroborate the fact with a
clear conscience.</p>

<p>"It was indeed enough to anger a saint in Heaven! Seven more of
the wounded have succumbed to their injuries; three of them little
children. Ah, these deeds of violence and bloodshed, for which
Nepenthe was ever infamous! When will the peace of God descend upon
our island?"</p>

<p>Mr. Parker had no idea when that might happen. He was not
particularly keen about the peace of God&mdash;he was keen about
keeping his job. None the less, he managed to move his head up and
down, in a decidedly becoming fashion.</p>

<p>"And now," concluded the <i>parroco</i>, "with your kind
permission, I will take my leave, to confer with the clergy if I
can discover any of them, as to what can be done towards forming a
procession. I confess that the more I think upon your idea, Signor
Parker, the more I like it. If only we can find a sufficient number
to participate!"</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that. Only toll the bells. You will get your
men. This eruption is enough to make anybody religious. I
mean&mdash;you know what I mean, <i>parroco</i>."</p>

<p>The acolytes having rekindled their torches His Reverence, a
happier man, stepped boldly out of doors and was swallowed up in
the murk.</p>

<p>This is a succinct and faithful account of the genesis of that
procession which was to become famous in Nepenthean annals. However
much, in later years, certain envious folks claim to be the
originators of the project it was, from first to last, the
Commissioner's idea. Honour to whom honour is due. He deserved, and
took, all credit for it. Meanwhile he sat down at his table once
more, and stared into the pitchy darkness.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, the sound of bells announced that something
was being done. Men looked out of their windows and saw flickering
lights moving about the gloom. The flames grouped themselves into
definite arrangements; a procession was being formed. As the
<i>parroco</i> had foretold it was but sparsely attended in the
beginning; out of sixty-five priests and canons of the church, only
fourteen found it convenient to attend; another dozen, however,
were presently shamed into taking their places in the ranks. The
same with the followers. Their number gradually increased. For the
bells did the work of arousing curiosity; they tolled plangently
into the night.</p>

<p>Stranger pageant never trod Nepenthe. Some thoughtful person had
discovered that umbrellas might be used with advantage. Umbrellas
were therefore utilized by all save the priests, the choristers,
torch-bearers, and those carrying the statue of the Saint who, for
reasons of personal dignity or expediency, preferred the other
method. They chanted their psalms and litanies through
handkerchiefs, knowing full well that their music would be none the
less pleasing to the Saint for being more than usually nasal in
tone. Thus, with soundless footfalls, they perambulated the streets
and outskirts of the town, gathering fresh recruits as they
went.</p>

<p>And still the ashes fell.</p>

<p>Viewing this cortege of awe-struck innocents braying into the
blackness under their umbrellas at the heels of a silver-plated
idol (not yet paid for), an intelligent God might well be proud of
his workmanship. So thought the <i>parroco</i>. He was undismayed.
Come what might, he had an explanation ready. Saint Dodekanus, if
the ashes continued to fall, was only showing his displeasure; he
was perfectly justified in letting his wrath be known for the
better guidance of mankind. Certain of the younger priests, on the
other hand, were growing nervous at the prospect of a possible
failure of the procession. They began to blame His Reverence for
what he had given them to understand was his own idea. For two
hours they had now been in movement; they had swallowed a hatful of
ashes. And yet no sign from Heaven. The sky appeared darker than
ever. Many of the followers, exhausted, dropped out of the
procession and returned sadly to their homes. They thought the
speculation was going to turn out badly. The others deemed in not
impossible that the Saint could not see them through so thick a
curtain. Well, then, he might hear them. They chanted more
furiously.</p>

<p>The sound must have reached Heaven, at last, for a miracle
occurred. The gloom decreased in density. Men looked up and beheld
a sickly radiance overhead&mdash;it was the sun, ever so far away;
it shone as when seen through thickly smoked glasses. Then a veil
seemed to be withdrawn. The light grew clearer&mdash;the song of
the penitents jubilant with hope. Sullen gleams, now, pierced the
murky air. Outlines of trees and houses crept furtively into their
old places. The fall of ashes had almost ceased. With a wrench, as
it seemed, the final covering was drawn away. The land lay flooded
in daylight.</p>

<p>That paean of joy and thanksgiving which ought to have greeted
this divine largesse, died on the lips of the beholders when they
saw the state of their island. Nepenthe was hardly recognizable.
The Saint had lifted a mantle from Heaven only to reveal the
desolation on earth. Ashes everywhere. Trees, houses, the fertile
fields, the mountain slopes&mdash;all were smothered under a layer
of monotonous pallor. They knew what it meant. It meant ruin to
their crops and vineyards. None the less, they raised a shout, a
half-hearted shout, of praise. For Nepentheans are born politicians
and courteous by nature. It is their heritage from the Good Duke
Alfred to "keep smiling." A shout was expected of them under the
circumstances; it costs nothing and may even do good, inasmuch as
Saint Dodekanus could remove the ashes as easily as he had sent
them. Why not shout?</p>

<p>"A miracle, a miracle!" the cry went up. "Long life to our
patron!"</p>

<p>A poor tribute; but the Saint took note of it. Half an hour had
barely passed ere the sky grew cloudy. Moist drops began to fall.
It was the first rain for many weeks, and foreign visitors,
accustomed to think of Nepenthe as a rainless land, were almost as
interested in the watery shower as in that of the ashes. Mud, such
mud as the oldest midwife could not remember, encumbered the roofs,
the fields, the roadways. It looked as if the whole island were
plastered over with a coating of liquid chocolate. Now, if the
shower would only continue&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly it ceased. The sky grew clear.</p>

<p>Saint Dodekanus had often been accused of possessing a grain of
malice. Some went so far as to say he had the Evil Eye. It was by
no means the first time in his long career that the natives had
found cause to complain of a certain rancour in his
temperament&mdash;of certain spiteful viperish acts to which the
priests, and they alone, were able to give a benevolent
interpretation. Now their wrath blazed out against the celestial
Patron. "He's not fit for his job," said some; "let's get a new
saint! The ruffian, the son of an impure mother&mdash;up to his
tricks, was he? Ah, the cut-throat, the Saracen, the old paederast:
into the ditch with him!"</p>

<p>During a brief moment his fate hung in the balance. For it was
plain that the ashes, if unwetted, might ultimately have been blown
away by the wind. But what was going to happen when all this mud,
baked by the sun into the hardness of brick, covered the
island?</p>

<p>Perhaps the Saint was only putting their tempers to the test.
The experiment of another shout was worth trying. One could always
punish him later on.</p>

<p>So feeble was the noise that Saint Dodekanus must have had
uncommonly good ears. He had. And soon showed his real feelings.
Rain fell once more. Instead of diminishing it grew more violent,
accompanied by warm blasts of wind. There was sunshine overhead,
but the peaks were shrouded in scudding vapours, trees bent under
the force of the wind; the sea, a welter of light and shade, was
dappled with silvery patches under the swiftly careering clouds.
Soon there came a blinding downpour. Gullies were blocked up with
mud; rills carried tons of it into the sea. Then the gale died
down; the sun beamed out of a bright evening sky. The miraculous
shower was over.</p>

<p>Men walked abroad and recognized their beloved Nepenthe once
more. It glowed in the tenderest hues. The events of morning and
midday were like a bad dream. Everything sparkled with unaccustomed
brilliance; the land was refreshed&mdash;swept clean; the sea alone
remained discoloured to a dingy brown. Truly, as the
Commissioner&mdash;once more a sound Protestant&mdash;remarked in
later years: "The old rotter came up to the scratch that time." So
clear and pleasant was the air that it seemed as if the wind had
actually veered to the north. But no. It still blew from the other
quarter&mdash;the old familiar sirocco. Which proved that the
shower of ashes had not been "carried elsewhere," as the youthful
teacher of mathematics had prognosticated. It had not been carried
anywhere. It simply ceased to fall, the volcano having momentarily
run out of its stock of objectionable materials.</p>

<p>The Clubmen therefore, calling to mind the discussion of the
morning, were led to revise their opinion as to that gentleman's
intelligence. They remembered one or two things. They remembered
that even when Heavenly Powers are not known to be directly
interested in the event, eruptions now and then come to an end
quite irrespective of the wind&mdash;a contingency which had not
been foreseen in the acute young Scandinavian's computations.</p>

<p>"That comes," they said, "of studying the higher
mathematics..."</p>

<p>For their miraculous deliverance from a shower of volcanic ashes
the islanders gave all credit, as might have been expected, to
their Patron Saint. And this proves how inadequately causes and
effects are understood, here on earth. For the priests, the most
intelligent section of the populace, knew perfectly well that but
for the orders of the <i>parroco</i> no procession could have taken
place. The Saint would have remained locked up in his musty shrine,
without the faintest chance of performing a miracle of any kind.
They argued, consequently, that Saint Dodekanus got the credit for
what was really the <i>parroco's</i> notion. And Torquemada,
thinking over the day's proceedings, was driven to confess that he
was indebted for the suggestion to the fertile brain of the
Nicaraguan Representative; in other words that he, the
<i>parroco</i>, was praised for what was really the Commissioner's
idea. And it is evident that if Mr. Parker's lady had not died from
the effects of a mosquito-sting, that gentleman would never have
been in such a complex funk as to suggest a procession to the
worthy priest.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the Commissioner, the Parish Priest, and
the Patron Saint got the credit for what was really an insect's
work.</p>

<p>Which shows how a mosquito can cure an eruption.</p>

<p>Everybody was drunk that night in honour of the Saint's bounty,
though Miss Wilberforce reached the climax of her activities at the
early hour of 4 p.m.&mdash;during the torchlight procession.</p>

<p>An uproar had been generated at the Club; chairs were broken,
bottles smashed, and sporting prints kicked about&mdash;all on
account of a comical but rather scurrilous speech contrasting
Europe with Australasia by a new-comer, a member of the New Zealand
House of Representatives, who limped home not long afterwards with
a damaged shinbone and black eye. The more violent parties had been
ejected during that incident, or carried to their lodgings. Only
about half the usual number was left&mdash;all moderates, so far as
drinking was concerned, but all more or less screwed that day as
befitted the occasion. There was the card-table group, where Mr.
Muhlen, with heightened colour in his cheeks, was losing money in
so brilliant a fashion that everyone swore he must be on the verge
of coming into a legacy or making some <i>coup</i> with a rich
woman. In another room the so-called bawdy section, presided over
by the dubious Mr. Hopkins, were discussing topics not adapted to
polite ears. The artistic group, sadly thinned by the ejection of
four of its more imaginative and virile members who had
distinguished themselves in the fray, now consisted solely of two
youngsters, a black-and-white man and a literary critic; they sat
in a corner by themselves, talking about colour-values in maudlin
strains.</p>

<p>The ordinary club-group had, as usual, installed themselves in
the most comfortable chairs on the balcony. They were boozing
steadily, like gentlemen, and having no end of fun with the poor
little Norwegian professor and his miscalculations. One of
them&mdash;a venerable toper of Anacreontic youthfulness known as
Charlie who turned up on Nepenthe at odd intervals and whom the
oldest inhabitant of the place had never seen otherwise than in a
state of benevolent fuddle&mdash;was saying to him:</p>

<p>"Instead of filling yourself up with whisky in that disgusting
fashion, my friend, you ought to travel. Then you wouldn't make
such an exhibition of yourself as you did this afternoon over those
ashes. Talk about volcanoes! Ever seen the Lake of Pitch in
Trinidad? Queer place, Trinidad. You never know where you are.
Though I can't say I saw much of it myself. I was asleep most of
the time, gentlemen, and often tight. Mostly both. All angles and
things, as you sail along. To get an idea of that place, you must
take a banana, for instance, and cut it in half, and cut that in
half again, and that half in half again&mdash;the banana, mind you,
must always remain the same size&mdash;or suppose you keep peeling
a potato, and peeling, and peeling&mdash;well, Mr. Professor, what
are you laughing at now?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking what an interesting map one could draw of
Trinidad if it's like that."</p>

<p>"Interesting? That's not the word. It's Hell. I wouldn't care to
take on that job, not even to oblige my poor old mother who died
fifty years ago. Ever been to Trinidad, Mr. Richards? Or you, Mr.
White? Or anybody? What, has nobody been to Trinidad? You ought to
travel more, gentlemen. How about you, Mr. Samuel?"</p>

<p>"Never further West than the Marble Arch. But a friend of mine
kept a ranch somewhere down there. One day he shot a skunk. Yes,
Mr. White, a skunk."</p>

<p>"A skunk? I'm blowed. What on earth ever for did he do that?
What did he want with a skunk? I thought they were protected by law
to keep down rattlesnakes. That's so, isn't it, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Snakes. You should see them in Trinidad. Snakes. Great Scot!
It's a queer place, is Trinidad. All angles and things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think one can talk about a place being all angles and
things, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Charlie, what did the fellow on the ranch want to do
with that rattlesnake?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say, my son. Maybe he thought of sending it to his
mother. Or perhaps he didn't want the skunk to get hold of its
tail: see?"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"They're very sensitive about their tails. As ticklish as any
young girl, I'm told."</p>

<p>"As bad as all that, are they?"</p>

<p>"I don't think one can talk about angles when describing an
island or even a continent, except in a figurative and flowery
fashion. As a teacher of geometry, it is my business to dwell among
angles; and the thirty-five boys in my class will bear witness to
the fact that my relations with angles, great and small, are above
reproach. I admit that there are angles everywhere, and that a man
who really likes their company will stumble against them in the
most unexpected places. But they are sometimes hard to see, unless
one deliberately looks for them. I think Charlie must have been
looking for them in Trinidad."</p>

<p>"I said angles <i>and things</i>, and I always stick to what I
say. <i>And things</i>. You will be good enough, Mr. Professor, to
draw your map accordingly."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! I rise to a point of order. Our Indian friend here
is greatly annoyed. He has been accused of wearing stays. At his
urgent request I have convinced myself, by personal inspection,
that he wears nothing of the kind. He is naturally slim-waisted, as
befits a worthy representative of the noble Hairyan race. It has
also been suggested that he loses caste by his present mode of
conduct. He begs me to say that, being a Jamshi-worshipper, he
doesn't care a brass farthing about caste. Thirdly, he has been
blamed in certain quarters for his immoderate indulgence in
Parker's poison. Let me tell you, gentlemen, in my capacity as
Vice-President, that for the last four thousand years his family
has enjoyed a special dispensation from the Great Mogul,
authorizing the eldest son to drink whatever he damn well pleases.
Our friend here happens to be the third son. But that is obviously
not his fault. If it were, he would have come forward with an
apology long ago. Gentlemen! I can't speak fairer than that.
Whoever says I'm not a gentleman&mdash;why, he isn't one
either."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear! I never knew you were an ornithologist,
Richards."</p>

<p>"Nor did I&mdash;not till this moment. But when it's a question
of defending the honour of a Club-member I always rise to the
occasion. Some things&mdash;they simply make my blood boil. Look at
this <i>Referee</i>: two weeks out of date! How the blazes is a
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Charlie, what did the fellow on the ranch want to do
with that skunk? Something about tickling, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my boy. We can't talk about it here. You're not old
enough yet. I don't think I ought to tell you. It's too funny for
words..."</p>

<p>"You're a black-and-white man and I'm a writer, and really, you
know, we're a cut above all those sots on the balcony. Now just be
reasonable for a moment. Look here. Have you ever thought about the
impossibility of realizing colour description in landscape? It's
struck me a good deal lately, here, with this blue sea, and those
orange tints on the mountain, and all the rest of it. Take any page
by a well-known writer&mdash;take a description of a sunset by
Symonds, for example. Well, he names all the gorgeous colours, the
yellow and red and violet, or whatever it may be, as he saw them.
But he can't make you see them&mdash;damned if he can. He can only
throw words at your head. I'm very much afraid, my dear fellow,
that humanity will never get its colour-values straightened out by
means of verbal symbols."</p>

<p>"I always know when a man is drunk, even when I'm drunk
myself."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When he talks about colour-values."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right. I'm feeling a bit muzzy about the legs,
as if I couldn't move. A bit fuzzy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Muzzy, I think you said."</p>

<p>"Fuzzy."</p>

<p>"Muzzy. But we needn't quarrel about it, need we? I shall be
sick in a minute, old man."</p>

<p>"It's rather hard on a fellow to be always misunderstood.
However, as I was saying when you interrupted me, I am feeling
slightly wobblish in the peripatetic or ambulatorial department.
But my head's all right. Now do be serious, for a change. You don't
seem to catch my drift. This blue sea, and those orange tints on
the mountains, I mean to say&mdash;how are they going to be held
fast by the optic apparatus? The lens, you understand. I want to be
able to shove them into a sketch-book, like you fellows. Well, how?
That's what I want to know. How to turn my retina into a
canvas."</p>

<p>"Rot, my good sir."</p>

<p>"It may be rot to you, but it strikes me as rather unfortunate,
all the same, when you come to think of it. This blue sea, I mean,
and those orange tints and all that, you know. Take a sunrise by
John Addington. Of course, as a matter of fact, we ought both to
have been born in another age&mdash;an age of sinecures. Why are
sinecures extinct? I feel as if I could be Governor of Madagascar
at this moment."</p>

<p>"I feel as if you were getting slightly intoxicated."</p>

<p>"That's me. But it's only my legs. My head is astonishingly
clear. And I do wish you would try, just for once in a way, to
follow my meaning. Be reasonable, for a change! I mean to say that
a man has talents for all sorts of things. I, for example, have
pronounced views upon agriculture. But what's the use of farming
without capital? What I mean to say is this: we see the blue sea
and the orange tints on the mountains, and all that, I mean, and we
don't seem to realize, I mean, that we may die at any moment and
never see them again. How few people grasp that simple fact! It's
enough to make one sick. Or do you think it's a laughing
matter?"</p>

<p>"Bally rotten, I call it. You're quite right. People don't
realize things the way they ought, except in a few selected
moments. They live like animals. I shall be sick in a minute, old
man."</p>

<p>"Like animals. Good Lord! You've hit the nail on the head this
time. How true that is. Like animals. Like animals. Like
animals."</p>

<p>"I know what we want. We want fresh air. No more Parker's poison
for me. Let's take a stroll."</p>

<p>"I would if I could. But I can't get off this chair, damn it. I
shall fall down if I move an inch. I can hardly turn my head round,
as it is. Awfully sorry. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"Gad! That's awkward. Couldn't we take your chair along with us,
somehow? I'm going to be sick, I tell you, this very minute."</p>

<p>"Not here, not here! Third on the left. But surely, my dear
fellow, you can put it off a little longer? Can't you be
reasonable, for once in your life? Just for once in your life? Do
listen to what those inebriated lunatics are saying on the
balcony..."</p>

<p>"What did you do to that skunk, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Not if I know it, young man. I promised my mother I'd never
tell. Another day, perhaps, when I've got a little whiskey inside
me. It's too funny for words."</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to go tickling young girls, Charlie. It's not
polite, at your age..."</p>

<p>They all cleared out, as it seemed, after midnight; some on all
fours, many of them fairly perpendicular. But when the serving lad
entered the premises in the sober light of morning, to clear up the
debris, he was surprised to perceive a human form reclining under a
table. It was the young Norwegian professor. He lay there wide
awake, with disheveled hair and an inspired gleam in his eye,
tracing on the floor, with the point of a corkscrew, what looked
like a tangle of parallelograms and conic sections. He said it was
a map of Trinidad.</p>

</p>

<p>As to Miss Wilberforce&mdash;she was becoming a real
problem.</p>

<p>Once again she had shocked the Faithful. She had misconducted
herself by interrupting the torchlight procession with some of
those usual or unusual antics, a detailed description of which,
while entertaining to a few lost souls, would certainly mortify the
majority of decent folks. The cup of endurance was full,
overbrimming. Once again she had passed the night in the lock-up.
Questioned as to her motives for this particular incident, she
artlessly blamed the darkness which misled her, she said, into the
regrettable delusion that it was night; "and at night, you
know..."</p>

<p>This, as Signor Malipizzo observed with his usual legal acumen,
might pass for an explanation but nevermore for an excuse. How much
longer, he continued, with a fine Ciceronian gesture of eloquent
indignation&mdash;how much longer would the foreign colony on
Nepenthe endure the presence in their midst of such a disgrace to
womanhood?</p>

<p>Thus spake the judge, well aware of what was expected from a man
in his position. In his heart he desired nothing less than her
departure; he was charmed with her disturbing influence; he hoped
she would live a hundred years on the island. In the first place he
received occasional gifts in kind from various grocers and
wine-merchants who enriched themselves by supplying her at
preposterous prices with intoxicants, and who thought by these
subtle tactics to retain him as an ally in their cause. Secondly
and chiefly, every new scandal of this nature gave him a fresh
opportunity of consigning her, temporarily, to the lock-up. Only
temporarily. Because Mr. Keith would be sure to bail her out again
in the morning, which meant another fifty francs in his pocket.</p>

<p>This is exactly what had just taken place. Mr. Keith had bailed
her out, for the thirty-fourth time. She was at liberty once more,
sobering down.</p>

<p>Both the Duchess and Madame Steynlin pitied her, as only one
woman can pity another. Often the prayed to their respective Gods,
Lutheran and High Church, that she might be led to see the error of
her ways or, failing that, removed by some happy accident from the
island or, failing that, run over by a passing vehicle and
injured&mdash;injured not dangerously, but merely to such an extent
as to necessitate her permanent seclusion from society. Other
careless folk were maimed by the furious driving of the
Nepentheans; it was a common form of accident. Miss
Wilberforce&mdash;the eye-sore, the scandal of her
sex&mdash;remained intact. Some impish deity seemed to guide her
wayward footsteps.</p>

<p>Had she been a person of low extraction there would have been no
difficulty in dealing with her. But she was so obviously a
lady&mdash;she had such obviously rich and influential connections
in England! These people, however glad to have her out of the way,
might object if violent measures were taken by persons who, after
all, had no right to interfere in her affairs. And the situation
was rendered none the less complex by the attitude of Miss
Wilberforce herself. She was a Tartar. She felt that all men's
hands were against her. She used her tongue to good purpose and, at
a pinch, her teeth and claws. The policemen of Nepenthe could bear
witness to that fact. Drunk, she had a perfectly blistering flow of
invective at command. Sober, she was apt to indulge in a dignified
bestiality of logic that cut like a knife. It was only in the
intermediate stage that she was affable and human. But to catch her
in that intermediate stage was extremely difficult. It was of such
very brief duration.</p>

<p>They tried to tempt her with the prospect of being repatriated.
Strenuously she opposed the notion, on grounds of health. She
argued that she had come to the South at the bidding of her English
doctor&mdash;which was true enough, that grave personage having
been urgently pressed by the family to make a suggestion; a return
to England, she declared, would be the death of her. If any attempt
were made to interfere with her liberty in this manner, she would
appeal to the local Court for protection.</p>

<p>Then the project of sending her to an Inebriates' Home on the
mainland was mooted. A sprightly young clergyman, not long resident
on Nepenthe, volunteered for the delicate task of persuading the
lady to take this step; it would be given out that she was merely
undergoing a "rest cure." The sprightly young clergyman started on
his mission full of bright expectations. He returned anon, looking
prematurely aged. Nobody could get a word out of him at first; he
seemed top have become afflicted with a partial paralysis of the
tongue. After babbling childishly for an hour or so he fell silent
altogether, and it was not till next morning that he recovered full
powers of speech. Wild horses, he then announced, would not drag
form his lips what had passed at the interview.</p>

<p>As a last resource it was decided to inaugurate a sanatorium on
the island for her especial benefit, with a trained nurse
permanently in attendance; during her ever-decreasing spells of
sobriety the place, together with the nurse, could be utilized for
needle-classes and so forth. Money was required. A committee of
ladies and gentlemen collected a certain small amount, but their
hopes did not rise high till the day when the Duchess broached the
subject to her countryman, Mr. van Koppen, after inveigling him
into what she called "a friendly teat-a-teat." Surfeited to
bursting-point with his favourite tea-cakes, the millionaire was in
a lovely humour. He declared his readiness, then and there, to
subscribe half a million francs to the scheme if&mdash;if his good
friend Mr. Keith would make himself responsible for a similar sum,
or even a thousandth part of it.</p>

<p>"Half a million francs&mdash;what's that, Duchess, as the price
of a smile from yourself? Cheap. Dirt cheap!"</p>

<p>"Another one?" queried the lady.</p>

<p>"Well, just one. I can't swallow any more. But I can still
chew."</p>

<p>So fatuously fond was he of this particular variety of condiment
that, on their account alone, he would have imported the Duchess
and her entire establishment into America. For all that, old Koppen
was no fool. Half a million buttered tea-cakes could not impair the
lively workings of a brain which had long ago mapped out a swift
and sure path to worldly success. He had wind of this project; his
answer was carefully prepared. It was a mathematical certainty that
not one cent of those half-million francs would ever leave his
pocket. For he knew what the Committee did not know&mdash;the real
character of his friend Keith. Keith was a good fellow but a
hopeless crank; Keith was perfectly capable of impoverishing
himself in order to keep Miss Wilberforce out of prison. As to
subscribing to the schemes of a pack of meddling fools who proposed
to intern the dear lady&mdash;Keith would see them all damned
first. This is how Mr. van Koppen, a profound student of human
nature, would have argued, had he lacked the opportunity of
discussing the question with his good friend. As a matter of fact
he had enjoyed that opportunity only a few days ago. He had warned
Keith of what was coming, and had found him equally alert to the
plans of the Committee and more desirous than himself, if possible,
of frustrating them. They had chuckled vastly over a bottle of dry
sparkling Nepenthe in anticipation of the event.</p>

<p>"Trust me," said Keith. "I'll talk their heads off."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I shan't be there!" thought the American.</p>

<p>He knew his good friend. Keith could be decidedly fatiguing,
especially when dead sober. He had all the Scotchman's passion for
dissecting the obvious, discovering new facets in the commonplace,
and squeezing the last drop out of a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>It was a thousand pities that the Duchess, in the exuberance of
her triumph, spread abroad the news of the millionaire's promise.
For that news had an unfortunate and unexpected result. The
Committee, which up till then had consisted of eight reputable
members, now swelled, rapidly and mysteriously, to fourteen. Six
new gentlemen, including the unspeakable Mr. Hopkins, got
themselves enrolled, and all six of them, as was afterwards made
manifest, were persons of questionable integrity. By dint of small
donations to the fund varying from five to fifteen francs, they had
contrived to have their names put down; it was worth while, they
thought, to risk a small sum on the chance of getting a slice out
of old Koppen's half-million which could not possibly be used up in
the rent or purchase of a three-roomed Sanatorium.</p>

<p>A committee of ladies and gentlemen, formed for charitable
purposes, should be like Caesar's wife. This one had come to
resemble the spouse of Claudius. Had the upright and intelligent
Mr. Freddy Parker still been its guiding spirit, he would soon have
weeded out these undesirable elements and kept the pickings for
himself. But Mr. Parker, since his lady's illness, seemed to be
withdrawn from all worldly concerns. He had become invisible. And
now that the lady was dead he would presumably grow more invisible
than ever. It was a severe blow to all concerned; to nobody more
than to the Commissioner himself when, on emerging into society
from his mourning retirement, he divined what a chance he had
missed.</p>

<p>Every single member of the small sub-committee who came, in
rather a formal group, to communicate to Mr. Keith the terms of the
millionaire's offer and to solicit his participation in the scheme,
purposed to attend the funeral of Mr. Parker's lady. It was the
right thing to do. That impressive function, already a day overdue,
had been irrevocably fixed for 10.30 a.m. at the instance of the
Chief Medical Officer of Health. Accordingly they reached the Villa
Khismet at the matutinal hour of 9 a.m., convinced that the short
interval would suffice to cajole out of Mr. Keith a sum sufficient
to bind old Koppen to his promise.</p>

<p>It struck them afterwards that this was their flagrant, initial
mistake. They ought to have controlled their impatience and waited
for a more opportune occasion.</p>

<p>And they would have waited, but for the fact that Mr. Hopkins, a
person of dubious motives and antecedents, had insinuated himself
into the deputation not without a purpose of his own. This
gentlemen insisted that delay was fatal. Mr. Keith, he argued,
would understand their impatience. The millionaire was sailing in a
day or two. One might never get that cheque cashed, or even signed,
before he left Nepenthe. And then? Why, then the scheme might fall
through and&mdash;he added to himself&mdash;how was he going to get
his share of the plunder?</p>

<p>The others, the respectable ones, gave way. Vainly they
remonstrated. Vainly they pointed out that old Koppen was not a man
to go back on his word; that a cheque could be made out in America
as well as anywhere else; that the crux of the question was not the
millionaire but his good friend Keith; that they might spoil all
their chances by approaching the latter at such an unseasonable
hour of the day. It was weak of them.</p>

<p>They ought to have waited. For Keith was fond of solitude at all
times, and any one of his dozen gardeners could have told them
that, like every other self-respecting scholar, he was in the habit
of breakfasting not earlier than 9.30, and dangerous to approach
before that meal. Or they might have made enquiries concerning his
mode of life among his fellow-countrymen on Nepenthe. The
bibliographer, for instance, would have informed them that Keith
was "generally sick about eleven"&mdash;meaning, by this playful
nonsense, to insinuate that it was not safe to disturb him till
after that hour. Be that as it may, he was certainly irritable
before breakfast-time on every single day of the year and, as it
happened, irritable beyond the common measure on this particular
morning, because the downpour of the previous afternoon had dashed
to pieces&mdash;among other material damage&mdash;the tender blooms
of certain priceless ipomaeas. That alone was enough to infuriate
an archangel. Moreover, like everybody else&mdash;he always
conformed to custom&mdash;he had been slightly tipsy overnight.
This had the singular effect of making him glum, ceremonious, and
ready to take offence.</p>

<p>Here, now was this pack of officious idiots blundering in upon
him. Under ordinary circumstances he would have tried to be polite.
As it was, he could hardly bring himself to give them a civil word
of welcome. They caught him on his way from the bath to the
garden&mdash;to a succulent breakfast under his favourite pine-tree
within view of the Tyrrhenian; and his own flowered silk
dressing-gown and gold-embroidered Turkish slippers contrasted
oddly with the solemn vestments, savouring of naphthaline, which
they had donned for the funeral. After the barest of apologies for
a costume which, he ventured to think, was as suitable as any other
for a gentleman at that hour of the morning, he bade them be seated
and listened to what the speaker had to say&mdash;blinking
ominously the while through his spectacles, like an owl with the
sun in its eyes.</p>

</p>

<p>It was a long and rambling exposition.</p>

<p>Miss Wilberforce must be protected against herself. They came to
him for a contribution, however small, which would enable Mr. van
Koppen to fulfil his promise. It was not a question of
meddlesomeness. It was a question of putting an end to a crying
public scandal. Miss Wilberforce spent her days in sleeping, and
her nights in shocking the population of Nepenthe. The lady should
be temporarily secluded in her own interests; she was not fit to be
left alone; it was an act of charity to do what one could towards
improving her health and prolonging her life. They were out for a
philanthropic object&mdash;to assist in helping a fellow creature.
Miss Wilberforce must be protected against herself. Mr. van
Koppen's half-million would enable them to compass this end. His
own contribution, however small, would enable Mr. van Koppen to
fulfil his promise. Miss Wilberforce must be protected&mdash;</p>

<p>He quite understood. Miss Wilberforce must be protected against
herself. And he disagreed heartily. Nobody must be protected
against himself. The attitude of a man towards his fellows should
be that of non-intervention, of benevolent egotism. Every person of
healthy digestion was aware of that cardinal truth. Unfortunately
persons of healthy digestions were not as common as they might be.
That was why straight thinking, on these and other subjects, was at
a discount. Nobody had a right to call himself well-disposed
towards society until he had grasped the elementary fact that the
only way to improve the universe was to improve oneself, and to
leave one's neighbour alone. The best way to begin improving
oneself was to keep one's own bowels open, and not trouble about
those of anybody else. Turkey rhubarb, in fact. The serenity of
outlook thereby attained would enable a man to perceive the
futility of interfering with the operation of natural
selection.</p>

<p>The speaker, he went on, had dropped the word charity. Had the
tribe of Israel cultivated a smattering of respect for physiology
or any other useful science instead of fussing about supernatural
pedigrees, they would have been more cautious as to their diet. Had
they been careful in the matter of dietary, their sacred writings
would never have seen the light of day. Those writings, a monument
of malnutrition and faulty digestive processes, were responsible
for three-quarters of what was called charity. Charity was
responsible for the greater part of human mischief and misery. The
revenues of the private charities of London alone exceeded five
million sterling annually. What were these revenues expended upon?
On keeping alive an incredible number of persons who ought to be
dead. What was the result of keeping these people alive? A
deterioration of the whole race. Charity consisted in setting a
premium on bodily ill-health and mental inefficiency. Charity was
an Oriental nightmare; an endeavour to raise the week to the level
of the strong; an incitement to improvidence. Charity disturbed the
national equilibrium; it lowered the standard of mankind instead of
raising it. Charity was an unmitigated nuisance which had
increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished.</p>

<p>By way of varying the phraseology, but not the thing, they had
called themselves philanthropists. The meaning of that venerable
word had decayed of late in characteristic fashion. Prometheus, the
archetype, brought fire from Heaven to comfort certain people who
had the wit to appreciate its uses. He did not waste his time
wet-nursing the unfit, like a modern philanthropist. What was a
modern philanthropist? He was a fellow who was always bothering you
to do something for somebody else. He appealed to your purse for
the supposed welfare of some pet degenerate. Prometheus appealed to
your intelligence for the real welfare of rational beings. A rich
man found it extremely simple, no doubt, to sign a cheque. But an
act was not necessarily sensible because it happened to be simple.
People ought to dominate their reflexes. Prometheus did not choose
the simplest course&mdash;he chose the wisest, and found it a
pretty tough job, too. That alone proved him to have been a man of
sound digestion and robust health. Had it been otherwise, indeed,
he would never have endured that vulture&mdash;business for so
long.</p>

<p class="caption">The Deputation</p>

<p>The deputation exchanged glances, puzzled by this pompous and
peevish exordium. It did not promise well; it sounded quite unlike
Mr. Keith's usually bland address. Perhaps he had not yet
breakfasted. "We ought to have waited," they thought. One of the
listeners was so annoyed that he began:</p>

<p>"A paradox, Mr. Keith, is not necessarily sensible, because it
happens to be simple"&mdash;but was overborne by that gentleman,
who proceeded calmly:</p>

<p>"So much for generalities. Now Miss Wilberforce is a lady of
independent means and of a certain age. She is not an infant, to be
protected against herself or against others; she has reached years
of indiscretion. Like a good many sensible persons she lives in
this country. Of course a residence here has its
drawbacks&mdash;very grave drawbacks, some of them. But the
drawbacks are counter-balanced by certain advantages. In short,
what applies to one country does not always apply to the other. Yet
you propose to treat her exactly as if she were living in England.
That strikes me as somewhat unreasonable."</p>

<p>"Mr. van Koppen has promised us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He may do what he likes with his money. But I don't see why I
should become the pivot for making my good friend do what strikes
me as a foolish action. I am too fond of him for that. Mr. van
Koppen and myself have many points in common; among other things
this feature, that neither of us is of aristocratic birth. I
suspect this is what made you count on me for a subscription. You
thought that I, having a little money of my own, might be tempted
by certain sycophantic instincts to emulate his misplaced
generosity. But I am not a snob. From the social point of view I
don't care a tuppenny damn for anyone. On the other hand, my origin
has given me something of Dr. Samuel Johnson's respect for what he
calls his betters. I like the upper classes, especially when they
behave according to their old traditions. That is why I like Miss
Wilberforce. She conducts herself, if report be true, with all the
shamelessness of a born lady. Born ladies are not so common that we
should hide them away in nursing homes. All forceful seclusion is
dishonouring. Every little insect, drunk or sober, enjoys its
freedom; and if you gentlemen were not philanthropists I would try
to point out how galling your proposal must be, how humiliating to
a high-spirited woman to be placed under lock and key, in charge of
some callous attendant. But to what purpose? Turkey
rhubarb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Keith, that we have come at an inopportune
moment?"</p>

<p>"It's quite possible. But I won't keep you much longer&mdash;you
must be dying to attend that funeral! In fact, I would not detain
you at all if I did not feel that you expected some kind of
explanation from me. What were we saying?"</p>

<p>"Turkey rhubarb."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! I was trying to be fair-minded which, by the way, is a
general mistake. It struck me that perhaps I over-emphasized its
advantages just now. Because, of course, there is something to be
said against the use of such drugs. In fact, now I come to think of
it, there is a good deal to be said in favour of constipation. It
is the cause of our English spleenfulness, and this spleenfulness,
properly directed, has its uses. It engenders a certain energetic
intolerance of mind. I think the success of our nation is largely
due to this particular quality. If I were an historian I would
amuse myself with proving that we owe not only Magna Charta, but
our whole Empire&mdash;Canada, Australia, and all the rest of
them&mdash;to our costive habits of body. What befits a nation,
however, does not always befit a man. To crush, in a fit of chronic
biliousness, the resistance of Bengal and add its land to the
British Empire, may be a racial virtue. To crush, in a fit of any
kind, the resistance of our next door neighbour Mr. Robinson, and
add his purse to our own, is an individual vice. No! I fail to
discover any personal advantage to be gained from excess of bile.
The bilious eye sees intensely, no doubt, but in a distorted and
narrow fashion; it is incapable of a generous outlook. Cloudy,
unserene! A closing-up, instead of a widening-out. The bowels of
compassion: what a wonderful old phrase! They ought to be kept
open. I look around me, and see extraordinarily little goodwill
among my fellow-creatures. Here is Miss Wilberforce. What she
yearns for is the milk of human kindness&mdash;gentle words, gentle
dealing, from all of us. Instead of that, every one is ready to
cast stones at her. She is treated like a pariah. For my part I do
not pass her by; I am not ashamed to consort with sinners, if such
they be; I would like, if I could, to make her free and happy
instead of imprisoning her in a place of self-reproach. A healthy
man is naturally well disposed, not on principle or from any divine
inspiration but because his bodily organs are performing their
proper functions. His judgment is not warped by the black humours
of indigestion. He perceives that natural laws, however harsh they
seem, are never so harsh as our amateurish attempts to circumvent
them. Modern philanthropy is an attempt of this nature. It is crass
emotionalism. Regarded from the point of view of the race, your
philanthropy is a disguised form of brutality."</p>

<p>"Mr. Keith!"</p>

<p>"All sentimentalists are criminals."</p>

<p>This perverse balderdash was getting on the nerves of the
deputation. It had one good effect, however. They had been afraid,
at first, of wasting Mr. Keith's time; now they began to realize
that he was wasting theirs.</p>

<p>"Speaking for myself, Mr. Keith, I should say that you are
spoiling your case by over-statement, and that these reflections of
yours are libels upon a class of men and women who devote their
time and money, often their lives, to alleviating the distress of
others. However that may be, they are generalities. We came to you
about a practical matter, and an urgent one. We want to remove a
crying scandal from the island. The habits of Miss Wilberforce, as
I think I pointed out, are shocking to all decent folks. I suppose
you won't deny that?"</p>

<p>"I remember your using those words. They struck me as remarkable
because, for my own part, I have not yet discovered any man, woman,
or child who could shock me. Some persons make a profession of
being scandalized. I am profoundly distrustful of them. It is the
prerogative of vulgarians to be shocked. If I ever felt inclined to
blush, it would not be a the crooked behaviour of men, but at their
crooked intellectual processes. Whenever a so-called scandal comes
my way, I thank God for the opportunity of seeing something new and
learning something to my advantage."</p>

<p>"There is nothing very new about the scandalous conduct of Miss
Wilberforce, save her unfortunate habit of divesting
herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please to note that there is a good deal of loose and
exaggerated talk going on here. But one thing is quite certain.
These exhibitions, supposing they really take place, have never
been known to occur until after midnight&mdash;with the lamentable
exception of yesterday afternoon, when it was even darker than
midnight. If your decent folks are so squeamish, what are they
doing in the streets at that unearthly hour? I am asleep them, as
they ought to be. This may account for the fact that I have never
seen the lady in a state of alcoholic exhilaration. But if I had
the good luck to stumble upon her, I would certainly not be
shocked."</p>

<p>"And what, may I ask, would you do?"</p>

<p>"My feelings towards the spectacle would depend upon the
momentary state of my mind. I might, for example, be in a
frolicsome Elizabethan mood. In that case I would appreciate the
humour of the situation. If only half of what I hear is true, she
must be extremely funny at such moments. I would probably laugh
myself into an apoplexy. I wish the English still possessed a shred
of the old sense of humour which Puritanism, and dyspepsia, and
newspaper reading, and tea-drinking have nearly extinguished. It
ought to be revived afresh. Nothing like a good drunkard for that
purpose. As a laughter-provoking device it is cheaper and more
effective than any pantomime yet invented; and none the worse,
surely, for being a little old-fashioned?"</p>

<p>"I must say, Mr. Keith, I don't think God created anybody to be
laughed at."</p>

<p>"Maybe he didn't. But a fellow can't help laughing, all the
same. On the other hand, I might be in that interfering
humanitarian mood which is liable to beset even the wisest of us. I
would then be tempted to lead her homeward gently but firmly,
simulating intoxication, if I could bring myself to do
it&mdash;pretending, you understand, to be in the same state as
herself, if I could manage it with any prospect of success&mdash;in
order to make her feel thoroughly at ease. I should not dream of
ruffling her state of mind by a single word f reproach; the private
feelings and self-respect, even of a drunkard, should never be
violated. Again, if I were in my ordinary reflective condition, I
should doubtless stand aside and muse, as I have often mused, upon
the folly of intemperance. Drunkenness&mdash;that shameful vice!
How many estimable men and women have succumbed to it; men I have
known, women I have loved and even respected! This makes me think
that we ought to be grateful to have so glaring an example of
insobriety before our eyes. We ought to regard Miss Wilberforce, if
your account of her be true, as a Divine warning. Warnings are not
sent for nothing. And you gentlemen&mdash;you propose to hide away
this heaven-sent warning in a sanatorium. That strikes me as flying
in the face of Providence."</p>

<p>"Our project would at least secure her from the risk of being
run over by some vehicle."</p>

<p>"Pray, why should the dear lady not choose to be run over?
Surely she can please herself? It would be an appropriate ending to
a brief and merry career. It would be more than this. We spoke,
just now, of her example as a deterrent to others. Well, this
example, so far as we spectators are concerned, would lose its
point and pungency if she died as you propose&mdash;a
half-reclaimed inebriate in some home. She must be run over, or
otherwise violently destroyed, if we are to have the full benefit
of the example. It is only then that we shall be able to say to
ourselves: Ah, we always thought it was risky to drink strong
waters, but <i>now we know</i>."</p>

<p>"A fatal accident of this kind, quite apart from other
considerations, would involve her relatives in all kinds of trouble
with the legal authorities of this country."</p>

<p>"I am glad you mentioned the legal aspects of the case; I had
nearly forgotten them. They are most important. In electing to be
crushed under a vehicle she acts on her own initiative. What you
propose is nothing less than a curtailment of her liberty of
action. How do you think the local authorities would envisage such
an arbitrary step? I imagine it may cost you dear to arrogate to
yourselves a power which, in this country at least, is vested in
the proper authorities. You may well find yourselves in collision
with the penal code of Italy which has been framed, and is now
administered, by men of uncommonly wide views&mdash;men who
reverence personal freedom above gold and rubies. I should not be
surprised if our magistrate in Nepenthe were to take, on legal
grounds, the same view of the case as I hold on purely moral ones,
namely, that your action towards Miss Wilberforce would amount to
an unwarranted persecution. He would regard it, very likely, as the
unjustifiable incarceration of a perfectly harmless individual.
Signor Malipizzo, I may say, has pronounced views as to his duties
towards society."</p>

<p>This was too much for one of the respectable members of the
deputation. He asked:</p>

<p>"Are you referring to that blackguard, that pestilential hog,
who calls himself a judge?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not know him as well as I do. I wish you knew
him better. I wish you knew him as well as I do! He is worth
knowing. Let me tell you something about him&mdash;something new
and characteristic. Like many natives, he is scrupulously fair
minded and honest. Now I can get on, at a pinch, even with an
upright man. That is because I always try to discover the good side
of my fellow-creatures. But other people cannot. Accordingly, being
an incorruptible magistrate, he is liable to encounter hostility
among a certain disreputable section of the populace. His
conscientious methods expose him to the accusation of harsh
dealing. This has happened more than once. It happened only two
days ago, when he sentenced to prison a batch of Russian lunatics
who were responsible, among other damage, for the death of three
innocent school-children. I commend his action. He erred, if at
all, on the side of leniency; for we really cannot have a pack of
raving wolves at large here. It is different in Russia. You can go
mad there&mdash;indeed that country, with its vast plains and
trackless forests, seems to have been especially created for the
purpose of running amok. But this island is really too small; there
are so many glass windows and babies about&mdash;don't you think
so, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Nepenthe is certainly a small place, Mr. Keith."</p>

<p>"Note, now, how differently he treats Miss Wilberforce, who not
only never killed three school-children but has never, to the best
of my knowledge, injured a living creature. I am informed on good
authority that, after spending a tumultuous night in gaol, she has
already regained her liberty. And this, if I am not mistaken, is
the second or third occasion at least on which our judge has
behaved in a similar manner towards her. Once more I commend his
action. Why has Signor Malipizzo set the lady free? Because, unlike
a modern philanthropist, he is aware of the wider issues involved;
he acts not with the severity of a fanatic, but with the
understanding, the tolerance, the mellow sympathy of a man of the
world. I said that everyone on Nepenthe treated Miss Wilberforce as
a pariah. That was a mistake. I ought to have allowed for one
exception&mdash;our admirable judge! It strikes me as significant
that an official who is bound to her by no ties of
blood-relationship or nationality and who enjoys, moreover, a
reputation&mdash;however undeserved&mdash;for harshness, should be
the one person on Nepenthe to stretch a point in her favour; the
one person who extends to her the hand of friendship, whose heart
goes out in sympathy with her sad case. Significant, and not
altogether creditable to us, her compatriots. Now who, I wonder, is
the friend of man, the modern Prometheus; you who incarcerate her,
or this alien lawyer who sets her free? To be perfectly frank, I
find your attitude contrasts unfavourably with his own. You are the
rigorists, the harsh ones. He is the humanitarian. Yes, gentlemen!
In my humble opinion there is not a shadow of a doubt about it.
Signor Malipizzo is the true philanthropist..."</p>

<p>The deputation, wending to the market-place rather hurriedly in
order to take their places in the funeral cortege, said to
themselves:</p>

<p>"We ought to have waited."</p>

<p>Thinking it over as they marched along, the respectable members
came to the conclusion that the others, the Hopkins section, were
really to blame for the discomfiture of the expedition. It was they
who had insisted with specious arguments upon an interview at this
unseasonable hour of the morning; as for themselves, they would
gladly have waited for a more suitable occasion. In undertones, low
but venomous, they commented upon the undue haste of Mr. Hopkins
and its probable motives. Later on they understood everything. Then
they called him a thief and a rogue, loudly&mdash;but not to his
face.</p>

<p>Which shows yet again how inadequately causes and effects are
appreciated here on earth. The dubious Mr. Hopkins may well have
been moved by mercenary considerations. But this fact had nothing
to do with the unsatisfactory issue of the affair. In other words,
even as the Saint, in the matter of that volcanic eruption, had
previously gotten the praise for what was not his merit, so now
this sinner was blamed for what was not his fault. Had the
sub-committee waited till the crack of doom, it would have made no
difference whatever to the general trend of Mr. Keith's sententious
irrelevancies.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if they had caught him in a better humour, he might
have had the decency to invite them to luncheon after the
funeral.</p>

<p>Even this was problematical.</p>

<p>The funeral was a roaring success. The display of ecclesiastics
and choristers was unusually fine. Torquemada had seen to that part
of the business. It was his duty henceforward to cherish the
bereaved representative of Nicaragua&mdash;a possible convert, at
his hand, to the true faith. The Clubmen, headed by the excellent
Mr. Richards, wore their gravest faces. Furthermore, in view of the
lady's quasi-official position, the authorities of the island were
present in full numbers; the Militia, too, looked superb in their
picturesque uniforms. And so large was the unofficial attendance,
so deafening the music, so brilliant the sunshine, so perfect the
general arrangements that even the deceased, captious as she was,
could hardly (under other circumstances) have avoided expressing
her approval of the performance.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">Madame Steynlin's Hat</p>

<p>There was an adequate display of fictitious grief among her
social equals. Madame Steynlin, in particular, carried it
off&mdash;to outward appearances&mdash;with remarkable success. She
looked really quite upset, and her hat, as usual, attracted the
attention of all the ladies. Madame Steynlin's hats were
proverbial. She was always appearing in new ones of the most costly
varieties. And never, by any chance, did they accord with her
uncommon and rather ripe style of beauty. Madame Steynlin was too
romantic to dress well. She trimmed her heart, and not her
garments. A tidy little income, however, enabled her to eke out
lack of taste by recklessness of expenditure. This particular hat,
it was observed, must have cost a fortune. And yet it was a perfect
fright; it made her look fifteen years older, to the delight of all
the other women.</p>

<p>What cared Madame Steynlin about hats? Her distressful
appearance was not feigned; she was truly upset, though not about
the death of the Commissioner's lady. With an effort whose violence
nobody but herself could appreciate she had managed to extricate
herself from the lion&mdash;like embraces of Peter the
Great&mdash;to what purpose? To perform an odious social duty; to
waste a fair morning in simulating grief for the death of a woman
whom she loathed like poison. Nobody would ever understand what a
trial in altruism had been. Nobody, in fact, ever gave her credit
for a grain of self-abnegation. And yet she was always trying to
please people&mdash;denying herself this and that. How harshly the
world judged!</p>

<p>She was also troubled in mind, though in a lesser degree, about
the fate of the remainder of the Russian colony. Were they not all
her brothers and sisters&mdash;these laughing, round-cheeked
primitives? The magistrate, that caricature of a man, that
vindictive and corrupt atheist, that tiger in human form, was
doubtless thirsting for the blood of those still at liberty on
Nepenthe. How much longer would Peter escape his malice? The dear
boy! Her lambkin, her little soul&mdash;she had learnt to babble a
few words of Russian&mdash;her play for, harmless, ever-hungry
Peter! On this lovely island, where all men should be at
peace&mdash;how harshly they dealt with one another!</p>

<p>The rest of the foreign colony, undisturbed by such bitter
personal reflections, appeared to bear the loss of the lady with
praiseworthy equanimity. They were, in truth, considerably relieved
in mind. Death is the great equalizer. In his pale presence they
forgot their old squabbles and jealousies; they forgot their
numberless and legitimate complaints against this woman. All
honoured the defunct who had now lost, presumably for ever, the
capacity of mischief-making.</p>

<p>There was undisguised sorrow among the trades-people and
Residency servants. They flocked to the procession in crowds,
desiring by this last mark of respect to attract the benevolent
notice of the Commissioner and to be remembered in the event of
some future settling-up of accounts. To their tear-stained eyes, it
looked as if this happy event were receding further and further
away into the dim distance. Hoping against hope, they mourned
sincerely. And none wept more convincingly that the little maid
Enrichetta, an orphan of tender years whom the lady had taken into
her service as an act of charity and forthwith set to work like a
galley-slave. The child was convulsed with sobs. She foresaw, with
the intuition of despair, that instead of being paid her miserable
wages for the last five months she would have to content herself
with a couple of her deceased mistress's skirts, thirty-eight
inches too wide round the waist.</p>

<p>There were wreaths&mdash;abundance of wreaths. Noticeable among
them was an enormous floral tribute from the owner of the
<i>Flutterby</i>. It attracted the most favourable comment. People
said that nobody but a multi-multi-multi-millionaire could afford
to forgive an affront like that affair of the crpe de Chine. As a
matter of fact, old Koppen would have been the last person on earth
to forgive an injury of this particular kind. He was a good
American; he never permitted loose talk about women, least of all
if they were in any way connected with himself; he would get purple
in the face, he would ramp and rage and hop about like a veritable
Sioux, in the face of any suggestion of improprieties on board his
yacht. No, Cornelius van Koppen had acted in all innocence, from
natural kindliness of heart. The legend had never reached his
hears, nobody (for a wonder) having dared to mention it to him.</p>

<p>Another wreath, from Count Caloveglia&mdash;an uncommonly pretty
one, with a simple but heartfelt inscription&mdash;created
legitimate surprise. Those white camellias, people reckoned, could
not have cost less than twenty francs, and everybody knew that the
dear old boy was as poor as a church mouse and that, moreover, he
had enjoyed nothing but a bowing acquaintance with the deceased
lady. He had indeed only spoken to her once in his life. But her
face&mdash;her face had left an indelible impression on his
sensitive and artistic mind.</p>

<p>There was something Greek about Count Caloveglia. His pedigree,
uncontaminated by Moor or Spaniard, went back to hoariest
antiquity. Many people said he was a reincarnation of old Hellas.
Elbowing his way through crowded cities or chatting with sunburnt
peasant-lads among the vineyards, he received thrills of
pleasurable inspiration&mdash;thrills to which grosser natures are
inaccessible. He loved to watch the bodily movements of his
fellow-creatures and all the eloquent gestures of Southern
life&mdash;the lingering smile, the sullen stare of anger, the firm
or flaccid step. Within this world of humdrum happenings he created
a world of his own, a sculptor's paradise. Colour said little to
him. He was enamoured of form, the lively passion of the flesh, the
tremulous play of nerve and muscle. A connoisseur of pose and
expression, he looked at mankind from the plastic point of view,
peering through accidentals into what was spiritual, pre-ordained,
inevitable; striving to interpret&mdash;to waylay and hold
fast&mdash;that divinity, fair or foul, which resides within one
and all of us. How would this one look, divested of ephemeral
appurtenances and standing there, in bronze or marble; what were
the essential qualities of those features&mdash;their aesthetic
mission to men like himself; to what type or relic of the classic
age might they be assimilated? He was for ever disentangling the
eternal from mundane accessories. And there was an element of the
eternal, he used to declare, in every creature of earth.</p>

<p>His was an enviable life. He dwelt among masterpieces. They were
his beacons, his comrades, his realities. As for other
things&mdash;the social accidents of time and place, his cares and
his poverty&mdash;he wore them lightly; they sat upon his shoulders
with easy grace, like his own threadbare coat. When he walked among
men he could not help contriving imaginary statuary in his head,
historical portraits or legendary groups; the faces and attitudes
of those he encountered&mdash;each one found a place in the teeming
realm of his creative phantasy, each one beckoned to him, from
afar, as a joyous and necessary revelation.</p>

<p>An enviable life; and never more enviable than on the occasion
when he was introduced, at some absurd tea-party to the lady known
as the Commissioner's stepsister. The face! It took possession of
him. It haunted his artistic dreamings from the same day onwards.
He had always cherished ambitious designs&mdash;none more ambitious
than a certain piece of work conceived in the bold Pergamese
manner, a noble cluster of women to be entitled "The
Eumenides."...Her face! That wonderful face proclaimed itself the
keynote of the group. If he lived a thousand years he would never
behold its like again. What would he not have given to model the
lady, then and there!</p>

<p>But modeling was out of the question for the present. It must
never be known that he was still capable of such an effort; it
might spoil all his chances for the business in hand. He must
continue to pose as heretofore for a harmless antiquarian, a
dreamer. Nobody, save old Andrea the servant, must know the secret
of his life. Yet he was not without hopes of being able to reveal
himself ere long in his true character of creator. The day was
perhaps not far distant when a pecuniary transaction between
himself and his respected American friend, Mr. van Koppen, would
ease the burdensome poverty of his life. Then&mdash;then he would
return to the gold projects of his youth; to the "Eumenides," first
of all. Light-hearted with bright expectancy, he saw the financial
deal well-nigh concluded; the cheque might be in his pocket within
a week; and now already he saw himself, in imagination, donning his
faded frock-coat and wending his way down to the Residency to lay
the foundations of his heart's desire. He would broach the subject
with that insinuating Southern graciousness which was part and
parcel of his nature; the lady's vanity could be trusted to do the
rest. He knew of old that no woman, however chaste and winsome, can
resist the temptation of sitting as model to a genuine
Count&mdash;and such a handsome old Count, into the bargain.</p>

<p>And now suddenly she had died&mdash;died, it might be, only a
few days too soon. That face, that peerless face, was lost for ever
to the world of art&mdash;his ideal snatched away by the relentless
hand of fate. He mourned as only a sculptor can mourn. Thus it came
about that something stronger than himself impelled him to manifest
his grief. Despite Andrea's respectful but insistent remonstrances
as to the appalling outlay, the wreath of camellias was ordered and
dispatched. An artist's tribute...</p>

<p>It created both surprise and a most excellent impression. What a
gentleman he was! Always doing the right thing. How splendid of
him. So they reasoned, though the wiser ones added that if he had
known the deceased lady a little better he might have hit upon a
more sensible way of spending his money.</p>

<p>The fact that there was a good deal of social gossip like this,
that appointments for picnics and other functions were being made,
would go alone to prove the advantages of a funeral of this kind,
quite apart from the universal relief experienced when the coffin
was lowered into the earth, and bystanders realized that the lady
was at last definitely transferred into Abraham's bosom.</p>

</p>

<p>All Nepenthe had stood by the side of the grave&mdash;all, save
only Mr. Keith. He remained at home. And this was rather odd, for
it is the right thing to attend people's funerals, and Mr. Keith
prided himself upon always doing the right thing. It was his boast
to pass for a typical Anglo-Saxon, the finest race on earth, when
all is said and done; and he used to point out that you could not
be a typical Anglo-Saxon unless you respected yourself, and you
could not respect yourself unless you respected simultaneously your
neighbours and their habits, however perverse they might sometimes
appear. Now a funeral, being unavoidable, cannot by an
prestidigitations of logic be called perverse. All the more reason
for being present. But for a strange twist or kink in his nature,
therefore, he would have been on the spot. He would have turned up
in the market-place to the minute, since he prided himself likewise
upon his love of punctuality, declaring that it was one of the many
virtues he possessed in common with Her Majesty Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>He disliked funerals. For all his open mind and open bowels, Mr.
Keith displayed an unreasoning hatred of death and, what was still
more remarkable, not the least shame in confessing it.</p>

<p>"The next interment I purpose to attend," he would say, "will be
my own. May if be far off! No; I don't care about funerals and the
suggestion they convey. A cowardly attitude? I think not. The
coward refuses to face a fact. Death is a fact. I have often faced
him. He is not a pretty fellow. Most men only give him a shy glance
out of a corner of their eye. It scares them out of their wits and
makes them say all sorts of snobbishly respectful things about him.
Sheer flummery! It is with Death as it is with God&mdash;we call
them good because we are afraid of what they can do to us. That
accounts for our politeness. Death, universal and inevitable, is
none the less a villainous institution. Every other antagonist can
be ignored or bribed or circumvented or crushed outright. But here
is a damnable spectre who knocks at the door and does not wait to
hear you say, 'Come in.' Hateful! If other people think differently
it is because they live differently. How do they live? Like a cow
that has stumbled into a dark hole, and now spends its time
wondering how it managed to get such a sore behind. Such persons
may well be gladdened by the approach of death. It is the best
thing they can do&mdash;to depart from world which they call a dark
hole, a world which was obviously not made for them, seeing that
they are always feeling uncomfortable about one thing or another.
Good riddance to them and their moral stomach-aches."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith professed never to feel uncomfortable. Oh, no! He had
no moral stomach-aches. Unlike other folks, he "reacted to external
stimuli in appropriate fashion," he cultivated the "function of the
real," he always knew how to "dominate his reflexes." His neural
currents were "duly co-ordinated." Mr. Keith was in love with life.
It dealt fairly with him. It made him loth to bid farewell to this
gracious earth and the blue sky overhead, to his cooks and his
books, his gardeners and roses and flaming cannas; loth to exchange
these things of love, these tangible delights, for a hideous and
everlasting annihilation.</p>

<p>That was why, having got rid of the committee of exasperating
buffoons, he was now prolonging breakfast far beyond the usual
hour. The meal was over at last; and still he felt disinclined to
move. Those people had disquieted his composure with their mephitic
rant about philanthropy; they had almost succeeded in spoiling his
morning. And now this funeral! Would he go into the house and do
some reading or write a few letters? No. He could not write letters
just them. He was not feeling sufficiently Rabelaisian. Epicurus
was his God for the moment. In a mood of heathen wistfulness he lit
a cigar and leaned back in the chair trying to recapture his
serenity.</p>

<p>It was his favourite corner of the domain&mdash;a kind of
projecting spur or platform shaded by a few grandiose umbrella
pines. Near at hand, on a slightly lower level, rose a group of
flame&mdash;like cypresses whose shapely outlines stood out against
the sea, shining far below like a lake of pearl. The milky sheen of
morning, soon to be dispelled by the breeze, still hung about the
water and distant continent&mdash;it trembled upon the horizon in
bands of translucent opal. His eye roved round the undulating
garden, full of sunlight and flowers and buzzing insects. From a
verbena hard by came the liquid song of a blackcap. It gave him
pleasure; he encouraged the blackcaps, delighting in their music
and because they destroyed the spiders whose troublesome webs were
apt to come in contact with his spectacles. The gardeners had
severest instructions not to approach their nests. It was one of
the minor griefs of his life that, being so short-sighted, he could
never discover a bird's nest; no, not even as a child. Memories of
boyhood began to flit through his mind; they curled upwards in the
scented wreaths of his Havana...</p>

<p>The golden oriole's flute-like whistle poured down from some
leafy summit in a sudden stream of melody. A hurried note, he
thought; expressed without much feeling&mdash;from duty rather than
inclination; not like the full-throated ease of other orioles in
other lands he knew. And so were the nightingales. They profited by
his hospitality for a day or two and then, uttering a perfunctory
little tune, some breathless and insincere word of
thanks&mdash;just like any human visitor&mdash;betook themselves
elsewhere, northwards.</p>

<p>Northwards!</p>

<p>He glanced into the mazy foliage of the pine tree overhead, out
of which a shower of aromatic fragrance was descending to mingle
with the harsher perfume of the cypress. How they changed their
faces, the conifers&mdash;so fervent and friendly at this hour, so
forbidding at nighttime! Rifts of blue sky now gleamed through its
network of branches; drenched in the sunny rays, the tree seemed to
shudder and crackle with warmth. He listened. There was silence
among those coralline articulations. Soon it would be broken. Soon
the cicada would strike up its note in the labyrinth of
needles&mdash;annual signal for his own departure from Nepenthe. He
always waited for the first cicada.</p>

<p>Northwards!</p>

<p>To his little place in the Highlands, at first. The meager soil
and parsimonious culture, the reasonable discourse of the people,
their wholesome disputatiousness, acted as a kind of purge or tonic
after all this Southern exuberance. Scotland chastened him; its
rocks and tawny glinting waters and bleak purple uplands rectified
his perspective. He called to mind the sensuous melancholy of the
birches, the foxgloves, the hedgerows smothered in dog-roses; he
remembered the nights, full of fairy-like suggestion and odours of
earth and budding leaves&mdash;those wonderful nights with their
silvery radiance, calm and benignant, streaming upwards form the
luminous North.</p>

<p>Then, after strolling aimlessly elsewhere, on sea or land,
visiting friends&mdash;no matter whom or where&mdash;he would
return to Nepenthe to indulge his genius to the full in the vintage
bacchanals. He owned a small plantation that lay high up, among the
easterly cliffs of the island. It produced that mountain wine which
was held to be the best on Nepenthe. The vines grew upon a natural
platform, surrounded by rugged lava crags that overhung the
sea.</p>

<p>Hither he was wont to repair with certain of his domestic staff
and three or four friends from out of his "inner circle," to
superintend the pressing of the grapes. There was a rude structure
of masonry on the spot&mdash;a vaulted chamber containing winepress
and vats and hoes and other implements of the husbandman's
time-honoured craft; a few chairs and a table completed the
furniture. Nobody knew exactly what happened up here. People talked
of wild and shameless carousals; the rocks were said to resound
with ribald laughter while Mr. Keith, oozing paganism at every
pore, danced faun-like measures to the sound of rustic flutes.
Certain it was that the party often got riotously tipsy.</p>

<p>So tipsy that sometimes their host was unable to be moved down
to his villa. On such days he was put to bed on the floor between
two wine barrels, and the chef hastily advised to come up with some
food and a portable kitchen range. In earliest morning he would
insist upon tottering forth to watch the sun as it rose behind the
peaks of the distant mainland, flooding the sea with golden
radiance and causing the precipices to glitter like burnished
bronze. He loved the sunrise&mdash;he saw it so seldom. Then
breakfast; a rather simple breakfast by way of a change. It was on
one of these occasions that the chef made a mistake which his
master was slow to forgive. He prepared for that critical meal a
dish of poached eggs, the sight of which threw Mr. Keith into an
incomprehensible fit of rage.</p>

<p>"Take those damned things away, quickly!" he commanded. It was
the celebrated artist's one and only <i>lche</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, he did not sleep on the spot. Peasants,
climbing to their work on the hillsides in the twilit hour of dawn,
were wont to encounter that staggering procession headed by Mr.
Keith who, with spectacles all awry and crooning softly to himself,
was carried round the more perilous turnings by a contingent of his
devoted retainers.</p>

<p>He found it pleasant to live like this. And now another spring
was nearing to its end. For how many more years, he wondered...That
confounded funeral...</p>

<p>There was a rustle at his back. The southerly breeze had struck
Nepenthe on its morning ripple over the Tyrrhenian, setting things
astir; it searched a passage through those mighty canes which
sprouted in a dank hollow where the rains of winter commingled
their waters. The leaves grew vocal with a sound like the splash of
a rivulet. Often had he listened joyfully to that melody which
compensated, to some small degree, for the lack of the old Duke's
twenty-four fountains. Legendary music! Now it made him sad. What
was its burden? <i>Midas had asses' ears</i>. Midas, the fabled
king, whose touch turned everything to gold. And gold, and
jewels&mdash;of what avail were these against the spectre?</p>

<p>The gardeners, moving with bare feet among the sinuous paths,
were quick to perceive that a cloud had fallen upon his spirit.
They divined his moods with the tactfulness of natural sympathy. On
some horticultural pretext one of them drew near and craftily
engaged his thoughts and conversation. At last he said something
that made him smile. One or two more appeared upon the scene, as if
by accident. It was evident that the master needed cheering up.
They began to tell him the fairy-tales he loved; tales of robbers
and witches and pirates&mdash;grand old tales that never wearied
him. To arouse his interest they joked among themselves, as though
unaware of his existence. One of them, and then another, sang some
wild song of love and war which he had picked up while wandering
with his flocks among the craggy hills of yonder mainland. He was
laughing now; outdoing their songs and stories. It kept him
young&mdash;to unbend, to play the fool in company such as theirs
and relax the fibres stiffened by conventionality; it refreshed him
to exchange the ephemeral for the eternal, the tomfoolery of social
life for Theocritus and his deathless creatures. How fair it was,
this smiling earth! How blithely the young voices went aloft!</p>

<p>They failed to drown those other strains, vagrant wraiths that
now floated upwards over fields and houses on the tepid wings of
the sirocco&mdash;fragmentary snatches, torn from the brazen
measure of the municipal band as it marched with the funeral
procession. He cursed the sounds from the bottom of his heart. They
reminded him of that infamous apparition, of all he most ardently
desired to forget. His laughter died down. Wanly he looked at his
mirthful pagans, the embodiment of joys. Yes; these were his
distractions, his playmates, his elixir of life, his antidote
against the only disease, the only sin, crime, vice which he
recognized on earth&mdash;a vice none the less, because it happened
to be the inevitable&mdash;the vice of old age. And all the time
that pallid swarm came crowding on: messengers from the inexorable
spectre. He felt them creeping about with ghostly tread, blighting
the radiance of his life, tainting the very air he breathed.
Hateful intruders! They wailed among his lilies. The garden was
full of their horrid footsteps.</p>

<p>In their presence Mr. Keith began to experience an uncomfortable
sensation, a kind of chill&mdash;as though something evil had
stepped between himself and the brave light of the sun. It was a
fleeting feeling which he would have diagnosed, in other people, as
perilously akin to a moral stomach-ache.</p>

</p>

<p>Only one other person on Nepenthe found cause to complain of the
municipal music. It was Mr. Heard. Altogether, he was not greatly
edified by this, the first funeral of its kind he had ever
witnessed. A rowdy-dowdy business, he called it. The music was too
lively and blatant for so solemn an occasion; the gorgeous
vestments of the clergy, the loud chattering among the mourners,
the violent gestures that accompanied Torquemada's well-meant and
carefully prepared oration (Don Francesco, a born speaker, would
have done it better, but the defunct was no friend or even client
of his)&mdash;all these things savoured slightly of irreverence.
Everyone was talking and laughing as they marched along. It was
more like a polonaise than a funeral. In his African period the
sight of such a burial would have affected him unpleasantly. But
Mr. Heard was changing, widening out.</p>

<p>"These people live gaily," he said to himself. "Why not? A
funeral is supposed to be nothing but a friendly leave-taking. Why
not be cheerful about it? We are all going to see each other again,
sometime, somewhere. I suppose..."</p>

<p>The problem gave him no trouble whatever.</p>

<p>He found himself walking side by side with Mr. Eames who
ventured to remark, in a seemly whisper, that he attended the
funeral not so much out of respect for the lamented
lady&mdash;every cloud, he fancied, had a silver lining&mdash;as
because he hoped to gather, from among so representative a
concourse of natives and foreigners, the "popular impression" of
yesterday's eruption, with a view to utilizing it in this appendix
on <i>Recent Volcanic Phenomena of Nepenthe</i>.</p>

<p>"Really?" replied the bishop. "A chapter on Volcanic Phenomena?
It is sure to be interesting."</p>

<p>Mr. Eames warmed to his subject.</p>

<p>It might be made interesting, he agreed, but for his own
ignorance of geology. As it was the business gave him a vast deal
of trouble. Monsignor Perrelli had dealt with geological matters in
a fashion far too summary for present-day requirements. The old
scholar was not to blame, of course, seeing that geology was quite
a modern science; but he might at least have been a little more
painstaking in his record of those showers of ashes and lapilli
which were known to have covered the island from time to time. His
account of them was lamentably defective. It was literally
bristling with&mdash;with&mdash;with lacunae, which had to be
filled up by means of laborious references to contemporary
chronicles. Altogether one of the most unsatisfactory sections of
an otherwise admirable work...</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you," said Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"I wish you could. I wish anyone could. There was that young
Jew, Marten, who understood more about these things than most
people. A coarse little fellow, but quite a specialist. He promised
to supply me with an up-to-date statement, accompanied by a map of
the geological structure of the island. I said to myself: Just what
I wanted! Well, this confounded statement has never reached my
hands. Now I fear he has left the place. Gone away altogether.
Didn't have the decency to say good-bye or leave his address. Too
bad. Who knows when the next mineralogist will turn up? These
fellows are not as common as blackbirds. Meanwhile I have to rely
on my own efforts. It's wonderful, by the way, how much a person
can pick up of odds and ends of information when forced, by a hobby
of this kind, to delve into recondite departments of knowledge
which he would otherwise not have dreamt of exploring. One grows
quite encyclopaedic! Minerals, medicine, strategy, heraldry,
navigation, palaeography, statistics, politics, botany&mdash;what
did I know or care about all these things before I stumbled on old
Perrelli? Have you ever tried to annotate a classic, Mr. Heard? I
assure you it opens up new vistas, new realms of delight. It gives
one a genuine zest in life. Enthralling!"</p>

<p>And thereupon the bibliographer fell silent, all at once. He had
succumbed, yet again, to his besetting sin: talking too
enthusiastically to outsiders of what was nearest his heart. Why on
earth should a globe-trotting bishop be bothered about the
mineralogy of Nepenthe? It was absurd: tactless of him.</p>

<p>He tried to atone for the blunder by some mundane
trivialities.</p>

<p>"What are you doing afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Going up to see Mrs. Meadows."</p>

<p>"Are you? Do remember me very kindly! Or perhaps&mdash;no.
Better not. Fact is, she cut me dead two days ago. At least, it
looked uncommonly like it. I confess I was rather upset, because
I'm not conscious of having done anything to annoy her. Indeed,
I've always felt a kind of weakness for Mrs. Meadows; there is
something so fine and womanly about her. Will you try to find out
what it's all about? Thanks. Perhaps she may not have noticed me.
She was walking very fast. And I must say she was not looking
herself at all. Not at all. White and scared. Looked as if she had
seen a ghost."</p>

<p>The bishop was troubled by these words.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" he asked. "You alarm me. I think I'll be off this
minute. She is my cousin, you know; and I've been rather concerned
about her lately. Yes; I won't wait for the end of this funeral;
I'll be off! Perhaps we shall meet this evening. Then I can tell
you her news. As to deliberately cutting you&mdash;don't you
believe that for a minute."</p>

<p>"I shall be down here about seven o'clock..."</p>

<p>"People like her," thought Mr. Heard, as he fell out of the
procession. He would make a point of having a good long chat, and
perhaps stay to luncheon.</p>

<p>He dreaded the coming heat of midday. It was quite warm enough
already, as he climbed slowly upward by the short cuts that
intersected the driving road, availing himself of every little
patch of shade that fell from trees or cottages athwart the
pathway.</p>

<p>The country seemed deserted, the funeral ceremony having
attracted all the natives from far and near. Yet one figure was
moving rapidly up the road in front of him. Muhlen! Even at this
distance he was recognizable; he looked, as usual, overdressed.
What was he doing there, at this hour? Mr. Heard remembered seeing
him go up, once before, at the same time of the day.</p>

<p>He called to mind what he had heard from Keith in the boat. He
was quite prepared to believe that this man lived on blackmail and
women; that was precisely what he looked like. A villainous
personality, masquerading under an assumed name. The sight of the
fellow annoyed him. What business had he to transact up there?
Retlow! Once more he began to puzzle where he had heard that name.
It conjured up, dimly, some unpleasant connotation. Where? Long
ago; so much was clear. For a brief moment he felt on the verge of
remembering. Then his mind became blank as before; the revelation
had slipped away, past recall.</p>

<p>He was glad to enter the shady garden of the villa Mon Repos.
Old Caterina sat, sphinx-like, on the stones at the house entrance.
There was some knitting-work on her lap, with brown wool and
curiously shaped needles; one foot rested on the base of the
cradle, which she rocked from time to time. At his approach she
rose up, stark and hieratic, without a trace of a friendly smile on
her countenance. Was the lady indoors? No, she was out. Out! Where?
There was a definite but enigmatical movement of her withered brown
arm; it appeared to embrace the universe. And when would she be
back? No reply whatever. Only a slight upward movement of the eyes,
as much as to say: God knows!</p>

<p>"I'll wait," thought Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>He walked past the forbidding hag who seemed to exhale a
positive hostility towards him, and entered his cousin's
sitting-room. He would wait. He waited. He glanced through a pile
of illustrated newspapers that lay about. And still he waited. The
room looked different somehow; almost untidy. There were no rouses
about. An hour passed. And still no sign of his cousin.</p>

<p>Out. Always out. What could this mean? Where could she be? It
was all rather mysterious and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>At last he took out his watch. Ten minutes to one! No use
waiting any longer. He scribbled a hasty note, left it on the
writing-table, and walked into the garden past the impenetrable
Caterina, who barely deigned to glance up from her knitting. He
would look for a carriage, and give himself the luxury of a drive
down. It was too hot to walk at that hour.</p>

<p>Strolling along he espied a familiar courtyard that gave upon
the street; Count Caloveglia's place. On an impulse he entered the
massive portal which stood invitingly ajar. Two elderly gentlemen
sat discoursing in the shade of the fig tree; there was no
difficulty in recognizing the stranger as Mr. van Koppen, the
American millionaire, a frequent visitor, they said, of Count
Caloveglia.</p>

<p>A bronze statuette, green with age, stood on a pedestal before
them.</p>

<p>"How kind of you to come and see me!" said the Italian. "Pray
make yourself as comfortable as you can, though these chairs, I
fear, are not of the latest design. You are going to do me the
honour, are you not, of sharing my simple luncheon? Mr. van Koppen
is staying too."</p>

<p>"Very good of you!"</p>

<p>"Delighted to make your acquaintance," said the millionaire.
"Keith was talking about you only yesterday&mdash;such nice things!
Do stay. Count Caloveglia has been touching on most interesting
subjects&mdash;I would come from the other end of the world to
listen to him."</p>

<p>The Count, manifestly shy of these praises, interrupted by
asking:</p>

<p>"What do you think of that bronze, Mr. Heard?"</p>

<p>It was an exquisite little thing.</p>

<p>Perfect to the finger-tips and glowing in a lustrous patina of
golden-green, the Locri Faun&mdash;so-called from the place of its
discovery&mdash;was declared to be stamped with the hall-mark of
individual distinction which the artificers of old Hellas contrived
to impress upon every one of the rare surviving bronzes of its
period. It was perhaps the finest of the whole group. No wonder the
statue had created wild excitement among the few, the very few,
discreet amateurs who had been permitted to inspect the relic prior
to its clandestine departure from the country. And much as they
might deplore the fact that it was probably going to adorn the
museum of Mr. Cornelius van Koppen, an alien millionaire, not one
of them found it in his heart to disapprove Count Caloveglia's
action. For they all liked him. Every one liked him. They all
understood his position. He was a necessitous widower with a
marriageable daughter on his hands, a girl whom everybody admired
for her beauty and charm of character.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen, like all the rest, knew what hard times he had
gone through; how, born of an ancient and wealthy family, he had
not hesitated to sell his wonderful collection of antiques together
with all but a shred of his ancestral estates, in order to redeem
the gambling debts of a brother. That amounted to quixotism, they
declared. They little realized what anguish of mind this step had
cost him, for he concealed his true feelings under a cloak of
playful worldliness. Excess of grief, he held, is an unlovely
thing&mdash;not meet to be displayed before men. All excess is
unlovely. That was Count Caloveglia's classic point of view.
Measure! Measure in everything.</p>

<p>People revered him, above all else, for his knowledge in matters
of art. His connoisseurship was not one of mere learning; it was
intuitional. Astonishing tales were told of him. By the sense of
touch alone, and in the dark, he could appraise correctly any piece
of plastic work you liked. He had a natural affinity with such
things. They held it quite likely that the blood of Praxiteles or
his compeers may still have flowed through his veins&mdash;certain
at all events, that there hung about his person the traditions of
the versatile colonists on the shores of Magna Graecia who, freed
by legions of slaves from the trivial vexations which beset modern
lives, were able to create in their golden leisure those monuments
of beauty which are the envy and despair of our generation. On all
that concerned the history and technique of ancient bronzes, more
especially, he was <i>facile princeps</i> in the land, and it was
hinted, after the sale of his property, that Count Caloveglia would
not be low to retrieve the fortunes of his family by putting into
exercise those talents for metal-working of which, as a gifted boy,
he had already shown himself to be possessed.</p>

<p>In this they were disappointed. He spoke of these things as
"sins of his youth," professing an invincible distaste, in these
later years, for the drudgery of work. He called himself an old
dreamer. There was a shed, it is true, attached to the house, a
shed which went by the name of a studio. All visitors were taken to
see this atelier. It was smothered in dust and cobwebs. Clearly, as
the Count himself would explain with a honeyed smile, it had not
been in use for twenty years or more.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen knew all this.</p>

<p>He knew about that strip of land which the old man had reserved
for himself at the sale of his ancestral domain. It lay among the
hills, some twenty or thirty miles above the classic site of Locri.
On this spot, people were given to understand, fragments of old
marbles and vases had been picked up by the peasantry within the
last years. Things of small worth&mdash;pottery mostly; they lay
about Count Caloveglia's Nepenthe courtyard and were given by him,
as keepsakes, to any visitor who showed an interest in them. He
attached no value to these trifles.</p>

<p>"From my little place on the hills," he would say. "Pray take it
as a memento of the pleasure which your visit has given me! Oh, it
is quite a small property, you know; just a few acres, with a
meager soil; in good years it produces a little oil and a barrel or
two of wine. And that is all. I only kept back this morsel from the
general ruin of my property&mdash;well, for sentimental reasons.
One likes to feel that one is still tied&mdash;by a slender thread,
it is true&mdash;to the land of one's ancestors. There is certainly
no wealth to be obtained above ground. But it is quite possible
that something might emerge from below, given the energy and the
means to make systematic excavations. The whole country is so rich
in remains of Hellenic life! The countrymen, ploughing my few
fields, often stumble upon some odd trifle of this kind. There was
that Demeter you may have heard about; sadly mutilated, alas!"</p>

<p>Before the discovery of the Locri Faun on this site the only
find of any value had been a battered head&mdash;a Demeter,
presumably. It was sold to a Paris collection for a few thousand
francs, and had thereafter attracted no further attention. It was
not worth talking about.</p>

<p>Now, when this dazzling Faun came to light and Mr. van Koppen
announced his intention of purchasing the masterpiece for his
collection, his art-expert, Sir Herbert Street&mdash;the eminent
connoisseur whom he had filched form the South Kensington Museum
with the bribe of a Cabinet Minister's salary&mdash;thought it his
duty to compare the disfigured Demeter with this new and marvelous
thing. Sir Herbert Street was an inordinately vain man, but
conscientious at the same time and, in matters of art-criticism,
sufficiently reliable. Not every art-expert would have done what he
did. In the interests of his employer he took the trouble of
journeying to Paris and carefully examining the poor Demeter
fragment. Then, viewing the Locri Faun at Nepenthe in the presence
of Count Caloveglia, he made rather a subtle remark.</p>

<p>"Does it not strike you, Count, that there is a curious, an
evasive kind of resemblance between this Faun and the Demeter?"</p>

<p>The old man beamed with joy at these words.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir Herbert, allow me to congratulate you on your keen
artistic perception! I believe you are the only person, besides
myself, who has hitherto been struck by those definite but
undefinable traits of similarity. Mr. van Koppen may well be proud
of your penetration&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the other, immensely flattered. "That is what
I am paid for, you know. But now, how do you account for the
likeness?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you my own hypothesis. I hold, to be brief, that
they both came from the same workshop."</p>

<p>"The same workshop! You amaze me."</p>

<p>"Yes, or at all events from the same school of craftsmen, or
some common fountain of inspiration. We know lamentably little of
the art history of even a great center like Locri, but, judging by
the hints of Pindar and Demosthenes, I think there may well have
been&mdash;there must have been&mdash;consummate local masters, now
forgotten, who propagated certain methods of work, certain fashions
in form and feeling and treatment which ended, naturally enough, in
a kind of fixed tradition. This would suffice to explain the
resemblance which your sagacity has enabled you to detect between
these two pieces. That is what I mean by saying that they came from
the same workshop. What do you think of my theory?"</p>

<p>"I think it accounts for the fact in a most satisfactory
manner," the expert had replied, thoroughly convinced.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen knew all this.</p>

<p>But he only believed half of it...</p>

<p>"You were saying, Count?"</p>

<p>The Italian shifted his glance from the dainty outlines of the
Locri Faun and smiled upon his interlocutor and then upon Mr.
Heard, who had at last taken a seat, after walking approvingly
round and round the statuette.</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you of another point which occurred later
on to Sir Herbert; a man, by the way, of unusual acumen. We agreed
that Locri was the indubitable place of origin both of the Demeter
and of the Faun. 'Well,' said he, 'granting this&mdash;how came
they to be unearthed up in the hills, on your property, twenty-five
miles away?' I confess I was at first nonplussed by this question.
For, to the best of my knowledge, there are no indications of any
large Hellenic settlement up there. But it struck me that there may
well have been a villa or two&mdash;indeed, there must have been,
to judge by the miscellaneous ancient material found on my little
place. This is what makes me think that these two relics were
deliberately carried there."</p>

<p>"Carried?"</p>

<p>"Carried. For although the summer season at Locri was
undoubtedly more endurable then than it now is, yet the town must
have been sufficiently hot in the dog-days; whereas my vineyard is
situated among the cool uplands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A kind of climatic station, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Don't you think that richer people had domiciles in
both places? The ancients, you know, were so sensitive in the
matter of temperatures that in summer time they traveled only by
night and some of their toughest generals had underground chambers
built for them during their campaigns. I can imagine, for instance,
some young and ardent lover of art, in the days when Pythagoras
taught under those glittering colonnades of Croton, when the fleets
of Metapontum swept the blue Ionian and Sybaris taught the world
how to live a life of ease&mdash;I can almost see this youth," he
pursued enthusiastically, "flitting from a hot palace on the plain
towards those breezy heights and, inflamed with an all-absorbing
passion for the beautiful, carrying up with him one or two, just
one or two, of those beloved bronzes from which he could not, and
would not, be parted&mdash;no, not even for a short summer
month&mdash;to be a joy to his eyes and an inspiration to h is soul
among the mountain solitudes. These men, I take it, had a sense in
which we their descendants are wholly deficient&mdash;the sense of
the solace, of the pleasurable companionship, to be derived from
works of art. That sense has been destroyed. The Japanese alone, of
all moderns, still foster an ingenuous affection which prompts them
to cling closely to these things of beauty, to press them to their
hearts as loving friends; the rest of us, surrounded by a world of
sordid ugliness, have become positively afraid of their fair but
reproachful shapes. Ah, Mr. van Koppen, that was the age of true
refinement, the age of gold! Nowadays&mdash;nowadays we only carry
our troubles about with us."</p>

<p>The bishop was touched by these moving words.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen, wearing a benevolent twinkle in his eye, said to
himself:</p>

<p>"What a lordly liar! Almost as good as myself."</p>

<p>Luncheon was announced.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," the Count was saying to Mr. Heard. "The
ideal cuisine should display an individual character; it should
offer a menu judiciously chosen from the kitchen-workshops of the
most diverse lands and peoples-a menu reflecting the master's alert
and fastidious taste. Is there anything better, for instance, than
a genuine Turkish pilaf? The Poles and Spaniards, too, have some
notable culinary creations. And if I were able to carry out my
ideas on this point I would certainly add to my list of dishes a
few of those strange Oriental confections which Mr. Keith has
successfully taught his Italian chef. There is suggestion about
them; they conjure up visions of that rich and glowing East which I
would give many years of my remaining life to see."</p>

<p>"Then why not do what I have proposed several times already?"
queried the millionaire. "I am in the East every winter; we reckon
this year to reach Bangkok the first fortnight in November. We can
find room for you on board. We'll make room! Your company would
give me more pleasure than I can say."</p>

<p>Count Caloveglia was probably the only male person on earth to
whom the owner of the <i>Flutterby</i> would have extended such an
invitation.</p>

<p>"My dear friend!" replied the other. "I shall never be able to
repay your kindness, as it is. Alas, it cannot be done, not now.
And don't you think," he went on, reverting to his theme, "that we
might revive a few of those forgotten recipes of the past? Not
their over-spiced entremets, I mean&mdash;their gross joints and
pasties, their swans and peacocks&mdash;but those which deal, for
example, with the preparation of fresh-water fishes? A pike, to my
way of thinking, is a coarse, mud-born creature. But if you will
take the trouble, as I once did, to dress a pike according to the
complicated instructions of some obsolete cookery-book, you will
find him sufficiently palatable, by way of a change."</p>

<p>"You would make an excellent chef!"</p>

<p>"It is plain," added Mr. Heard, "that the Count does not disdain
to practise his skill upon the most ancient and honourable of
domestic arts."</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't. I would cook <i>con amore</i> if I had leisure
and materials. All culinary tasks should be performed with
reverential love, don't you think so? To say that a cook must
possess the requisite outfit of culinary skill and
temperament&mdash;that is hardly more than saying that a soldier
must appear in uniform. You can have a bad soldier in uniform. The
true cook must have not only those externals, but a large dose of
general worldly experience. He is the perfect blend, the only
perfect blend, of artist and philosopher. He knows his worth: he
holds in his palm the happiness of mankind, the welfare of
generations yet unborn. That is why you will never obtain adequate
human nourishment from a young girl or boy. Such persons may do for
housework, but not in the kitchen. Never in the kitchen! No one can
aspire to be a philosopher who is in an incomplete state of
physical development. The true cook must be mature; she must know
the world form her social point of view, however humble it be; she
must have pondered concerning good and evil, in however lowly and
incongruous a fashion; she must have passed through the crucible of
sin and suffering or, at the very least&mdash;it is often the same
thing&mdash;of married life. Best of all, she should have a lover,
a fierce and brutal lover who beats and caresses her in turns; for
every woman worthy of the name is subject and entitled to
fluctuating psychic needs&mdash;needs which must be satisfied to
the very core, if the master is to enjoy sound, healthy fare."</p>

<p>"We don't always allow them to fulfil that last condition,"
observed Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"I know we don't. That is precisely why we are so often poisoned
or starved, instead of being cheered with wholesome food."</p>

<p>"You were speaking of woman-cooks?" asked van Koppen.</p>

<p>"I was. But it stands to reason that no woman can be trusted
with so responsible a task&mdash;so sacred a mission, I ought to
call it&mdash;in regions south of Bordeaux or east of Vienna. Among
many other reasons the whole sex is too drowsy, outside that
radius. And if she drinks a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drinks a little?"</p>

<p>"If she drinks a little, why it is all to the good. It shows
that she is fully equipped on the other side of her dual nature. It
proves that she possesses the prime requisite of the artist;
sensitiveness and a capacity for enthusiasm. Indeed, I often doubt
whether you will ever derive well-flavoured victuals from the
atelier of an individual who honestly despises or fears&mdash;it is
the same thing&mdash;the choicest gift of God. Andrea, my man here,
is abstemious to the last degree; not, I am glad to say, from
conviction or ill-health&mdash;it is the same thing&mdash;but
because he is incurably desirous of saving my money. What is the
consequence? You can taste his self-imposed asceticism in the very
<i>zabbaglione</i>, for which I must really apologize! It speaks to
the eye, but not to the heart. Let us hope the coffee will be more
harmonious."</p>

<p>"Would you not include some of our American dishes in your bill
of fare?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I would; a fine selection. I have most pleasant
recollections of the cuisine of Baltimore."</p>

<p>"You can get all those things in New York."</p>

<p>"No doubt; no doubt. But one thing invariably distresses me in
transatlantic dinners: the unseemly haste in rising. One might
really think the company were ashamed of so natural and jovial a
function as that to which a dining-room is consecrated. And then,
have you not noticed that, sitting at table, a certain intellectual
tone, an atmosphere of a definite kind, is insensibly generated
among the guests, whatever the subject of conversation may be? They
are often quite unaware of its existence, but it hangs none the
less about the room and binds the inmates together for the time
being. Suddenly we are bidden to rise and betake ourselves
elsewhere; to sit on other chairs in a different temperature among
different surroundings. It is a wrench. That peculiar atmosphere is
dissipated; the genius of the earlier moment driven out beyond
recapture; we must adapt ourselves to other conditions and begin
anew, often with a good deal of trouble&mdash;often, how often,
against our inclination! I call that a perverse custom. Every state
of the mind, whether we are in society or alone, should be pressed
to the last drop, irrespective of whether we happen to have
swallowed a final mouthful of food or not. When the conversation
has died, as everything must die, from sheer inability to draw
further breaths of life, then is the time to break up that old
encircling dome of thought; to construct a fresh one, if need be,
in a fresh environment."</p>

<p>"I confess," said the American, "it has always struck me as
rather barbarous&mdash;this running away. I like to linger. But the
ladies don't. They know that their dresses show off better in a
parlour than under a boards of a mahogany table; perhaps their
conversation, too, sounds better among arm-chairs and rugs. So we
run after then, as we generally do; instead of making them run
after us" ("as I do," he added to himself). "But, Count! If you
like our American dishes, why not get this man of yours to learn a
few from the Duchess? I know she would gladly teach him; she is not
jealous of her knowledge like a professional chef."</p>

<p>"I would have asked her that favour long ago, if Andrea had been
a born cook, like Keith's men. Unfortunately he is quite different.
The philosopher is represented in his nature, but not the artist.
He is only a devoted Arcadian, overflowing with good
intentions."</p>

<p>"And are they of no avail?" queried the bishop.</p>

<p>"I have been told that, in art and literature, they will atone
for deficiency of natural talent. It may be so; some persons, at
least, have been able to cajole their brains into believing this.
However that may be, I do not think the rule can be extended into
the domain of cookery. Good intentions&mdash;no. Nobody need
attempt such an imposture on his stomach, an upright and
uncompromising organ, which refuses to listen to nonsense. Or let
them try the experiment. Gastritis will be the result of good
intentions..."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard stretched out his legs. He was beginning to feel at
ease. He like this comely old man; he detected an abiding quality
in his outlook and person. And he felt at home in these
surroundings. There was an air of simplicity and refinement in that
calm ground-floor chamber, with its subdued light filtering through
windows that opened upon the courtyard, groined vaulting of noble
proportions, stucco frieze stained with age to an ivory hue, and
those other decorations which the Count, loyal to the traditions of
old-world peasant architecture, had piously left
unaltered&mdash;or, it may be, adapted to modern needs by touches
so deft as not to reveal his own consummate artistry. Through the
open door by which they had entered came breathings of warm wind
laden with the suave odour of a tuft of Madonna lilies that grew,
half neglected, in a shady corner. He had noticed them on his
entry&mdash;how they stood in proud clusters, bending forward with
mighty effort to reach the light.</p>

<p>His eye strayed into the courtyard and moved about the green
penumbra created by the fig tree's massy foliage; it glanced over
fragments of statuary half buried under a riot of leaves and
nodding flowers, and rested with complaisance upon the brickwork
flooring of herring-bone pattern, coloured in a warm, velvety
Indian-red. It was worn down here and there by tread of feet, and
pleasantly marked with patches of emerald-green moss and
amber-tinted streaks of light that played about its surface
wherever the sunbeams could pierce the dense leafage overhead.</p>

<p>From where he sat he could see the Locri Faun on its pedestal.
The figure was drowned in twilight. It seemed to slumber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Andrea, looking uncommonly ceremonious in white tie
and white cotton globes, was handing round the coffee. It was
pronounced an unqualified success. "Absolutely harmonious,"
declared the bishop, who had no hesitation, after a critical sip or
two, in extending his approval to a curiously flavoured liqueur of
unknown ingredients.</p>

<p>"From my little property on the mainland," the Count explained.
"If it were a clear day I would take you up to my roof and show you
the very site, although it is leagues and leagues away. But the
south wind always casts a haze over the mainland at this time of
day&mdash;a kind of veil."</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen, connoisseur of cigars, opened his capacious case
and offered its contents, without disclosing the fact that they
were specially manufactured for him at a fabulous price.</p>

<p>"You will find them smokable, I hope. As a matter of fact it's
no use trying to keep a cigar in good condition on the yacht. And
it must be the same on an island like this. So far as tobacco is
concerned, Nepenthe can be nothing but a ship at anchor."</p>

<p>"True," said the Count. "The moist sirocco is injurious to the
finer growths."</p>

<p>"This south wind!" exclaimed Mr. Heard. "This African pest! Is
there no other wind hereabouts? Tell me, Count, does the sirocco
always blow?"</p>

<p>"So far as I have observed it blows constantly during the spring
and summer. Hardly less constantly in autumn," he added. "And in
winter, often for weeks on end."</p>

<p>"Sounds promising," observed the bishop. "And has it no
influence on the character?"</p>

<p>"The native is accustomed, or resigned. Foreigners, sometimes,
are tempted to strange actions under its influence."</p>

<p>The American said:</p>

<p>"You spoke of amalgamating our cuisine with yours, or vice
versa. It can doubtless be done, to the profit of both parties. Why
not go a step further? Why not amalgamate our respective
civilizations?"</p>

<p>"A pleasant dream, my friend, with which I have occasionally
beguiled myself! Our contribution to human happiness, and that of
America&mdash;are they not irreconcilable? What is yours? Comfort,
time and labour saving contrivances; abundance; in a word, all that
is summed up under the denomination of utility. Ours, let us say,
is beauty. No doubt we could saturate ourselves with each other's
ideals, to our mutual advantage. But it would never be an amalgam;
the joints would show. It would be a successful graft, rather than
a fusion of elements. No; I do not see how beauty and utility are
ever to be syncretized into a homogeneous conception. They are too
antagonistic to coalesce."</p>

<p>"But there is abundant beauty and grandeur in modern American
life," said the millionaire, "quite apart, I mean, from that of the
natural scenery. A fine steam-engine, for instance&mdash;I call
that a beautiful thing, perfectly adapted to its end. Is its beauty
really so antagonistic to that of your civilization?"</p>

<p>"I know that some excellent persons have been writing lately
about the beauty of a swift-gliding motor-car and things of that
kind. They are right, in one sense of the word. For there is a
beauty to mechanical fitness which no art can enhance. But it is
not the beauty of which I spoke."</p>

<p>"And therefore," observed the bishop, "we ought to have another
word for it."</p>

<p>"Precisely, my dear sir! We ought to have another word. All
values are continually being revised, and tested anew. Are they
not? We have been restating moral values within the last
half-century; it is the same with artistic ones. New canons of
taste, new standards, are continually being evolved; there is a
general widening and multiplying of notions. This, I think, ought
to make us careful as to the words we employ, and ready to coin new
ones whenever a new idea is to be expressed. If we enlarge our
concepts, we should likewise enlarge our vocabulary. When I spoke
of beauty, I used the word in its narrow classical meaning, a
meaning which may be out of fashion, but which has the great
advantage that it happens to be irrevocably fixed and defined for
us by what the ancients themselves have handed down in the way of
art and criticism. This particular beauty, I say, is irreconcilable
with that other beauty of which you spoke."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the millionaire.</p>

<p>"There resides, for example, in Hellenic sculpture a certain
ingredient&mdash;what shall we call it? Let us call it the factor
of strangeness, of mystery! It is a vague emanation which radiates
from such works of art, and gives us a sense of their universal
applicability to all our changing moods and passions. That, I
suppose, is why we call them ever young. They beckon to all of us
familiarly and yet, as it were, from an unexplored world. They
speak to us at all seasons in some loving and yet enigmatical
language, such language as we may read, at times, in the eyes of a
child that wakes from sleep. Now the swiftest and fairest
steam-engine in the world is not for ever young; it grows obsolete
and ends, after a short life, on the scrap-heap. That is to say,
where usefulness enters, this spirit of mystery, of eternal youth,
is put to flight. And there is yet another element of classical
beauty which is equally at variance with your modern conception of
it: the element of authority. Beholding the Praxitelean Eros, the
veriest ruffian feels compelled to reverence the creator and his
work. 'Who was the man?' he asks; for he acknowledges that such
things impose themselves upon his untutored mind. Now a certain
Monsieur Cadillac builds the most beautiful motor-cars. Who is this
man? We do not care a fig about him. He is probably a Jewish
syndicate. Such being the case, I cannot bring myself to reverence
Monsieur Cadillac and his cars. They are comfortable, but that
factor of authority, which compels our homage to the Eros, is
wholly lacking. Yet both things are called beautiful. That we
should apply the same word to products so different, so hopelessly
conflicting, as those of Praxiteles and Monsieur
Cadillac&mdash;what does it prove? It proves our poverty of
invention. And what does it explain? It explains our confusion of
thought."</p>

</p>

<p>The millionaire remarked:</p>

<p>"I suppose the human outlook has shifted with the years.
Democracy hyas changed your old point of view."</p>

<p>"Assuredly. No American, no modern of any race, I fancy, can
divest himself of the notion that one man is as good as another; in
the eyes of God, they add&mdash;meaning in their own eyes. No
Greek, no ancient of any race, I fancy, could have burdened himself
with so preposterous a delusion. Democracy has killed my point of
view. It has substituted progress for civilization. To appreciate
things of beauty, as do the Americans, a man requires intelligence.
Intelligence is compatible with progress. To create them, as did
the Greeks, he requires intelligence and something else as well:
time. Democracy, in abolishing slavery, has eliminated that element
of time&mdash;an element which is indispensable to
civilization."</p>

<p>"We have some fine slavery in America at this moment."</p>

<p>"I am using the word in the antique sense. Your modern slavery
is of another kind. It has all the drawbacks and few of the
advantages of the classic variety. It gives leisure to the wrong
people&mdash;to those who praise the dignity of labour. Men who
talk about the Dignity of Labour had better say as little as
possible about civilization, for fear of confusing it with the
North Pole."</p>

<p>The American laughed.</p>

<p>"That's one for me!" he remarked.</p>

<p>"On the contrary! You are an admirable example of that happy
graft which we mentioned just now."</p>

<p>"Progress and civilization!" exclaimed Mr. Heard. "One uses
those words so much in my walk of life that, thinking it over, I
begin to wonder whether they mean more than this: that there are
perpetual readjustments going on. They are supposed to indicate an
upward movement, some vague step in the direction of betterment
which, frankly, I confess myself unable to perceive. What is the
use of civilization if it makes a man unhappy and unhealthy? The
uncivilized African native is happy and healthy. The poor creatures
among whom I worked, in the slums of London, are neither the one
nor the other; they are civilized. I glance down the ages, and see
nothing but&mdash;change! And perhaps not even change. Mere
differences of opinion as to the value of this or that in different
times and places."</p>

<p>"Pardon me! I was using the words in a specific sense. What I
mean by progress is the welding together of society for whatever
ends. Progress is a centripetal movement, obliterating man in the
mass. Civilization is centrifugal; it permits, it postulates, the
assertion of personality. The terms are, therefore, not synonymous.
They stand for hostile and divergent movements. Progress
subordinates. Civilization co-ordinates. The individual emerges in
civilization. He is submerged in progress."</p>

<p>"You might call civilization a placid lake," said the American,
"and the other a river or torrent."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" remarked Mr. Heard. "The one is static, the other
dynamic. And which of the two, Count, would you say was the more
beneficial to humanity?"</p>

<p>"Ah! For my part I would not bring such consideration to bear on
the point. We may deduce, from the evolution of society, that
progress is the newer movement, since the State, which welds
together, is of more recent growth than the individualistic family
or clan. This is as far as I care to go. To debate whether one be
better for mankind than the other betrays what I call an
anthropomorphic turn of mind; it is therefore a problem which, so
far as I am concerned, does not exist. I content myself with
establishing the fact that progress and civilization are
incompatible, mutually exclusive."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," asked the millionaire, "that it is
impossible to be progressive and civilized at the same time?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean to say. Now if America stands for progress,
this old world may be permitted&mdash;with a reasonable dose of
that flattery which we accord to the dead&mdash;to represent
civilization. Tell me, Mr. van Koppen, how do you propose to
amalgamate or reconcile such ferociously antagonistic strivings? I
fear we will have to wait for the millennium."</p>

<p>"The millennium!" echoed Mr. Heard. "That is another of those
unhappy words which are always cropping up in my department."</p>

<p>"Why unhappy?" asked Mr. van Koppen.</p>

<p>"Because they mean nothing. The millennium will never come."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because nobody wants it to come. They want tangible things.
Nobody wants a millennium."</p>

<p>"Which is very fortunate," observed the Count. "For if they did,
the Creator would be considerably embarrassed how to arrange
matters, seeing that every man's millennium differs from that of
his neighbour. Mine is not the same as yours. Now I wonder, Mr. van
Koppen&mdash;I wonder what your millennium would be like?"</p>

<p>"I wonder! I believe I never gave it a thought. I have had other
things to puzzle out."</p>

<p>And the millionaire straightway proceeded to think, in his usual
clear-cut fashion. "Something with girls in it," he soon concluded,
inwardly. Then aloud:</p>

<p>"I guess my millennium would be rather a contradictory sort of
business. I should require tobacco, to begin with. And the affair
would certainly not be complete, Count, without a great deal of
your company. The millennium of other people may be more simple.
That of the Duchess, for example, is at hand. She is about to join
the Roman Catholic Church."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Mr. Heard. "She gave me some remarkable
tea-cakes not long ago. Delicious. She said they were your
specialty."</p>

<p>"You have found them out, have you?" laughed the American. "I
always tell her that once a man begins on those tea-cakes there is
no reason on earth, that I can think of, why he should ever stop
again. All the same, I nearly overate myself the other day. That
was because we had a late luncheon on board. It shall never occur
again&mdash;the late luncheon, I mean. Have you discovered, by the
way, whether the business of Miss Wilberforce has been
settled?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard shook his head.</p>

<p>"Is that the person," enquired the Count, "who is reported to
drink to excess? I have never spoken to her. She belongs presumably
to the lower classes&mdash;to those who extract from alcohol the
pleasurable emotions which we derive from a good play, or music, or
a picture gallery."</p>

<p>"She is a lady."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Then she has relapsed into the intemperance of her
inferiors. That is not pretty."</p>

<p>"Temperance!" said the bishop. "Another of those words which I
am always being obliged to use. Pray tell me, Count, what you mean
by temperance."</p>

<p>"I should call it the exercise of our faculties and organs in
such a manner as to combine the maximum of pleasure with the
minimum of pain."</p>

<p>"And who is the judge of what constitutes the dividing line
between use and abuse?"</p>

<p>"We cannot do better, I imagine, than go to our own bodies for
an answer to that question. They will tell us exactly how far we
may proceed with impunity."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the millionaire, "if you drink a little too
much occasionally&mdash;only occasionally, I mean!&mdash;you would
not call that intemperance?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. We are not Puritans here. We do not give wrong
names to things. What you suggest would be by the way of a change,
I presume&mdash;like the eating of a pike: something we do not
indulge in every day. If I were to come home a little joyful now
and then, do you know what these people would say? They would say:
'The old gentleman is pleased to be merry to-night. Bless his
heart! May the wind do him good.' But if I behaved as Miss
Wilberforce is reported to do, they would say: 'That old man is
losing self-control. He is growing intemperate. Every evening! It
is not a pretty sight.' They never call it wrong. Their mode of
condemnation is to say that it is not pretty. The ethical moment,
you observe, is replaced by an aesthetic one. That is the
Mediterranean note. It is the merit of the Roman Church that she
left us some grains of common sense in regard to minor morals."</p>

<p>The bishop remarked:</p>

<p>"What I have seen of the local Catholicism strikes me as a kind
of pantomime. That is the fault of my upbringing, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not referring to externals! Externally, of course, our
Church is the purest rococo&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was expanding in this congenial atmosphere; he felt
himself in touch with permanent things. He glanced at the speaker.
How charming he looked, this silvery-haired old aristocrat! His
ample and gracious personality, his leisurely discourse&mdash;how
well they accorded with the environment! He suggested, in manner,
the secret of youth and all that is glad, unclouded, eternal; he
was a reflection, a belated flower, of the classic splendour which
lay in ruins about him. Such a man, he thought, deserves to be
happy and successful. What joy it must have been to a person of his
temperament&mdash;the chance discovery of the Locri Faun!</p>

<p>A great stillness brooded upon the enclosure beyond. The shadows
had shifted. Sunny patches lay, distributed in fresh patterns, upon
the old brickwork flooring. An oval shaft of light, glinting
through the foliage, had struck the pedestal of the Faun and was
stealthily crawling up its polished surface. He looked at the
statue. It was still slumbering in the shade. But a subtle change
had spread over the figure, or was it, he wondered, merely a change
in the state of his own mind, due to what the Count had said? There
was energy, now, in those tense muscles. The slightest touch, he
felt, would unseal the enchantment and cause life to flow through
the dull metal.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen was slightly ruffled.</p>

<p>"Are you not a little hard on the Puritans?" he asked. "Where
would we have been without them in America?"</p>

<p>"And after all," added the bishop, "they cleared up an infinity
of abuses. They were temperate, at all events! Too temperate in
some matters, I am inclined to think; they did not always allow for
human weakness. They went straight back to the Bible."</p>

<p>The Count shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"The Bible," he said, "is the most intemperate book I have ever
read."</p>

<p>"Dear me!"</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen, a tactful person, scented danger ahead. He
remarked:</p>

<p>"I did not know Italians read the Bible. Where did you become
acquainted with it?"</p>

<p>"In New York. I often amused myself strolling about the Jewish
quarter there and studying the inhabitants. Wonderful types,
wonderful poses! But hard to decipher, for a person of my race. One
day I said to myself: I will read their literature; it may be of
assistance. I went through the Talmud and the Bible. They helped me
to understand those people and their point of view."</p>

<p>"What is their point of view?"</p>

<p>"That God is an overseer. This, I think, is the keynote of the
Bible. And it explains why the Bible has always been regarded as an
exotic among Greco-Latin races, who are all pagans at heart. Our
God is not an overseer; he is a partaker. For the rest, we find the
whole trend of the Bible, its doctrinal tone, antagonistic to those
ideals of equanimity and moderation which, however disregarded in
practice, have always been held up hereabouts as theoretically
desirable. In short, we Southerners lack what you possess: an
elective affinity with that book. One may wonder how the morality
of those tawny Semites was enabled to graft itself upon your alien
white-skinned race with such tenacity as to influence your whole
national development. Well, I think I have at last puzzled it out,"
he added, "to my own satisfaction at least."</p>

<p>The bishop interposed with a laugh:</p>

<p>"I may tell you, Count, that I am not in the Episcopal mood
to-day. Not at all. Never felt less Episcopal in my life. For that
matter, it is our English ecclesiastics who have dealt some of the
most serious blows at Biblical authority of late, with their modern
exegesis. Pray go on!"</p>

<p>"I imagine it is nothing but a matter of racial
temperament."</p>

<p>"Goth and Latin?"</p>

<p>"One does not always like to employ such terms; they are so apt
to cover deficiency of ideas, or to obscure the issue. But
certainly the sun which colours our complexion and orders our daily
habits, influences at the same time our character and outlook. The
almost hysterical changes of light and darkness, summer and winter,
which have impressed themselves on the literature of the North, are
unknown here. Northern people, whether from climatic or other
causes, are prone to extremes, like their own myths and sagas. The
Bible is essentially a book of extremes. It is a violent document.
The Goth or Anglo-Saxon has taken kindly to this book because it
has always suited his purposes. It has suited his purposes because,
according to his abruptly varying moods, he has never been at a
loss to discover therein exactly what he wanted&mdash;authority for
every grade of emotional conduct, from savage vindictiveness to the
most abject self-abasement. One thing he would never have found,
had he cared to look for it&mdash;an incitement to live the life of
reason, to strive after intellectual honesty and self-respect, and
to keep his mind open to the logic of his five senses. That is why,
during the troubled Middle Ages when the oscillations of national
and individual life were yet abrupter&mdash;when, therefore, that
classical quality of temperance was more than ever at a
discount&mdash;the Bible took so firm a hold upon you. Its unquiet
teachings responded to the unquiet yearnings of men. Your
conservatism, your reverence for established institutions, has done
the rest. No! I do not call to mind any passages in the Bible
commending the temperate philosophic life; though it would be
strange if so large a miscellany did not contain a few sound
reflections. Temperance," he concluded, as though speaking to
himself&mdash;"temperance! All the rest is embroidery."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was thoughtful. The American observed:</p>

<p>"That side of the case never struck me before. How about
Solomon's proverbs?"</p>

<p>"Maxims of exhaustion, my dear friend. It is easy to preach to
me. I am an old man. I can read Solomon with a certain patience. We
want something for our children&mdash;something which does not
blight or deny, but vivifies and guides aright; something which
makes them hold up their heads. A friend, an older brother; not a
pedagogue. I would never recommend a boy to study these writings.
They would lower his spirits and his self-respect. Solomon, like
all reformed debauchees, has a depressing influence on the
young."</p>

<p>"Do you know England well?" asked Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"Very little. I have spent a few days in Liverpool and London,
here and there, on my periodical journeyings to the States. Kind
friends supply me with English books and papers; the excellent Sir
Herbert Street sends me more than I can possibly digest! I confess
that much of what I read was an enigma to me till I had studied the
Bible. Its teachings seem to have filtered, warm and fluid, through
the veins of your national and private life. Then, slowly, they
froze hard, congealing the whole body into a kind of crystal. Your
ethics are stereotyped in black-letter characters. A gargoyle
morality."</p>

<p>"It is certainly difficult," said Mr. van Koppen, "for an
Anglo-Saxon to appraise this book objectively. His mind has been
saturated with it in childhood to such an extent as to take on a
definite bias."</p>

<p>"Like the ancients with their <i>Iliad</i>. Where is a truer
poet than Homer? Yet the worship of him became a positive bane to
independent creative thought. What good things could be written
about the withering influence of Homer upon the intellectual life
of Rome!"</p>

<p>The bishop asked:</p>

<p>"You think the Bible has done the same for us?"</p>

<p>"I think it accounts for some Byzantine traits in your national
character and for the formlessness and hesitancy which I, at least,
seem to detect in the demeanour of many individual Anglo-Saxons.
They realize that their traditional upbringing is opposed to truth.
It gives them a sense of insecurity. It makes them shy and awkward.
Poise! That is what they need, and what this unbalanced Eastern
stuff will never give them."</p>

<p>"The withering influences of Homer: surely that is a bad sign?"
asked the American.</p>

<p>"And that of the Bible?" added Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"How shall a plant survive, save by withering now and then? If
the ancients had not exhausted themselves with Homer, the soil
might not have been ready for our Renaissance. A bad sign? Who can
tell! Good and bad&mdash;I question whether these are respectable
words to use."</p>

<p>"You are content, as you observed before, to establish a
fact?"</p>

<p>"Amply content. I leave the rest to the academicians. And the
only fact we seem to have established is that your notions of
morality resemble my notions of beauty in this one point: neither
of them are up to date. You will have be admire a steam-engine.
Why? Because of its delicately adjusted mechanism, its perfect
adaptation to modern needs. So be it. I will modify my conception
of what is fair in appearance. I will admire your steam-engine, and
thereby bring my ideals of beauty up to date. Will you modify your
conception of what is fair in conduct? Will you admire something
more adapted to modern needs than those intemperate Hebrew
doctrines; something with more delicately adjusted mechanism? The
mendicant friar, that flower of Oriental ethics&mdash;he is not up
to date. He resembles all Semites. He lacks self-respect. He
apologizes for being alive. It is not pretty&mdash;to apologize for
being alive!"</p>

<p>The American observed:</p>

<p>"I should say that even our greatest bigots, nowadays, don't
take those old doctrines as seriously as you seem to think."</p>

<p>"I daresay they don't. But they profess to reproach themselves
for not doing so. And this is more contemptible. It adds
insincerity to imbecility."</p>

<p class="caption">The Locri Faun</p>

<p>A sunny smile played about his face as he spoke these words. It
was evident that his thoughts were already far away. The bishop,
following the direction of his glance, saw that it rested upon the
statuette of the Faun whose head and shoulders were now enveloped
in a warm beam of light. Under that genial touch the old relic
seemed to have woke up from its slumber. Blood was throbbing in its
veins. It was inn movement; it dominated the scene in its emphatic
affirmation of joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, his eyes fixed upon the statuette, now realized the
significance of what had been said. He began to see more clearly.
Soon it dawned upon him that not joy alone was expressed by the
figure. Another quality, more evasive yet more compelling, resided
in its subtle grace: the element of mystery. There, emprisoned in
the bronze, dwelt some benignant oracle.</p>

<p>Puzzle as he would, that oracle refused to clothe itself in
words.</p>

<p>What could it be?</p>

<p>A message of universal application, "loving and enigmatical," as
the old man had called it. True! It was a greeting from an unknown
friend in an unknown land; something familiar from the dim past or
distant future; something that spoke of well-being&mdash;plain to
behold, hard to expound, like the dawning smile of childhood.</p>

</p>

<p>Towards evening, Mr. van Koppen drove the bishop down in the
carriage which he usually hired for the whole of his stay on
Nepenthe. They said little, having talked themselves out with the
Count. The American seemed to be thinking about something. Mr.
Heard's eye roamed over the landscape, rather anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't like that new cloud above the volcano," he
observed.</p>

<p>"Looks like ashes. Looks as if it might drift in our direction,
doesn't it, if the wind were strong enough to move it? Do you see
much of the Count?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Not as much as I should like. What excellent veal cutlets those
were! So white and tender. Quite different from the veal we get in
England. And that aromatic wine went uncommonly well with them. It
was his own growth, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Very likely. From that little vineyard which produces so many
good things." He chuckled softly. "As to English veal&mdash;I never
yet tasted any worth eating. If you don't slaughter a calf till
it's grown into a cow&mdash;why, you're not likely to get anything
but beef."</p>

<p>"They say the English cannot cook, in spite of the excellence of
their prime materials."</p>

<p>"I think the prime materials are at fault. They sacrifice
everything to size. It's barbaric. Those greasy Southdown sheep!
It's the same with their fowls; they're large, but
insipid&mdash;very different from the little things you get down
here. Now a goose is capital fodder. But if you grow him only for
his weight, you destroy his quality and flavour; you get a lump of
blubber instead of a bird."</p>

<p>"Apple sauce?"</p>

<p>"I don't like apples in any shape. A sour kind of potato, I call
them. They eat an awful lot of apples in our country. That is what
makes so many of our women as flat as boards, in front and
behind&mdash;especially in the Eastern States. It's apple-eating.
Apples ought to be taxed. They ruin the female figure. I'm not sure
that they don't sour the character as well."</p>

<p>"Don't you care about our English vegetables?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I'm much in love with them, Mr. Heard. Brussels
sprouts, for instance&mdash;I'm very partial to Brussels sprouts.
But the things they give you over there are the size of a bath
sponge, and much the same taste, I reckon. And the carrots! A
carrot ought to be small and round and yellow, it ought to melt in
the mouth like a plum. Those carrots aren't carrots at all. They're
walking sticks. And the peas! No, I don't care about English peas.
Too large and too lively for me."</p>

<p>"Lively?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Lively. I shall never forget my first experience of
them," he went on, laughing. "There were two or three in the dish;
just two or three; filled it up nicely. Looked like cannon-balls.
What do they expect me to do with these things? I wondered. I
didn't like to ask the waiter. One doesn't care to be taken for an
ignorant stranger. Well, I landed one on my plate and began carving
at it, to see if there was anything eatable inside the shell, when
the durned thing slipped away from my knife and crashed on to the
floor. Bounced up like a marble. I called for a nutcracker&mdash;'I
shall want the largest you've got,' I said. They couldn't find one.
Now I'm not the sort of man, Mr. Heard, to be beaten by a
vegetable, if it really was a vegetable. Because, you see, it
behaved more like a blamed mineral. I sent for the head waiter, and
took him into my confidence. I tried to talk English, like I'm
talking to you. 'What d'ye call these things?' I asked.
'Marrowfats, Sir.' 'Ah, I thought they weren't peas. You've got
<i>petits pois</i> down on the bill of fare. Better get that put
right. And now, how d'ye eat them?' 'You bite them!' That's what he
said. 'You bite them.' Of course I didn't believe him. I thought it
was just a bit of English humour, especially as the other waiter
was looking the opposite way all the time. Well, like a fool, I
said to myself: 'No harm in trying!' I've got pretty sharp teeth,
you know, for a boy of my age. That's how I managed to do what a
lot of you younger fellows couldn't have done. I got them fixed
into the softest of that bunch of marrowfats. But as to pulling
them out again! The head waiter, you bet, had disappeared. And the
other fellow was standing at the window with his back to me.
Looking up the street, I should say, to see if it was going to
rain."</p>

<p>After this little outburst, the millionaire seemed to have
nothing more to say.</p>

<p>He was thinking...</p>

<p>Cornelius van Koppen loved a good liar. He knew something about
the gentle art. It was an art, he used to say, which no fool should
be allowed to cultivate. There were too many amateurs knocking
about. These bunglers spoiled the trade. Without doing any good to
themselves, they roused distrust; they rubbed the fine bloom off
human credulity. His puritan conscience was enraged at petty
thefts, petty forgeries, petty larcenies. That was why he despised
that otherwise excellent person, the Financial Commissioner for
Nicaragua, whose wildest flights of embezzlement never exceeded a
few hundred dollars. He respected a man who, like himself, could
work in the grand style. To play upon the credulity of a
continent&mdash;it was Napoleonic, it was like stealing a kingdom;
it was not stealing at all. This, he shrewdly suspected, was what
his good friend the Count was engaged upon. That delightful old man
was working in the grand style.</p>

<p>Bronzes, ancient or modern, were Greek to Mr. van Koppen. He
could not tell the difference between the art of Clodion and of
Myron&mdash;had, in fact, never heard the names of these good
people and did not particularly care to hear them; he paid Sir
Herbert Street for that part of the business. But he had picked up,
in the course of his long humanitarian career, a good deal of
general knowledge. Old Koppen was no fool. He was intelligent;
intelligence, as the Count had said, being perfectly compatible
with progress. The millionaire could put two and two together as
fast as most men; he was celebrated, even among his quick-witted
compatriots, for an uncanny faculty of walking round people without
getting off his chair. Common sense, he called it.</p>

<p>Many a time he had listened to Count Caloveglia's rounded
periods anent the Locri Faun. Taking his own personal experience as
a guide, he had come to the conclusion that a man does not explain
things quite so satisfactorily, unless he has some business in
hand. Everything fitted into a hypothesis which had been slowly
maturing in his mind, namely, that he was confronted by a fraud, a
really noble fraud, a fraud after his own heart, a fraud deserving
the fullest support of every sensible man and woman.</p>

<p>That vineyard, for instance, with those antiquities. A good many
friends of his in the States had made their pile out of salted gold
mines. Why not salt a vineyard? Oh yes; everything fitted in
beautifully. The remoteness of that vineyard...a town like Locri
was obviously unsafe, too public a place for such important
discoveries. The conscientious Sir Herbert would certainly want to
make enquiries on the spot&mdash;enquiries which would prove that
no Faun had ever been found there. And that would ruin everything.
Therefore the statue had been "carried" to the vineyard in ancient
times by "some young and ardent lover of art." Carried, ha, ha! His
knowledge of human nature made him doubt whether the Locri Faun had
ever in its life made a further journey than to Caloveglia's shady
courtyard from that mysterious, dusty shed at the back of his
house. Or the Demeter either. That "sadly mutilated head" was a
feeler&mdash;a rehearsal. They both came "from the same workshop."
Excellent! That shed was the workshop&mdash;the birthplace of these
two antiques; the Count himself their old Hellenic creator.</p>

<p>Andrea, no doubt, was the secret.</p>

<p>These art experts! Here was Street, one of the best of them, a
man of celebrity in his department, solemnly pronouncing for the
authenticity of the fake&mdash;in the full and innocent conviction
that it was really authentic. A sucking babe. This man, he could
see by his simple society face, had not even made an arrangement
with the Count as to a commission for himself in the event of a
purchase being concluded. He was satisfied with his salary. These
experts&mdash;what a crowd of fools they were! Especially the
honest ones.</p>

<p>None the less, he was delighted with Sir Herbert's opinion. It
was exactly what he wanted. For he meant to help the County who, he
was sure, would never accept a cent from him save under a pretext
like that of the sale of the Faun. He loved old Caloveglia. There
was something clean and purposeful about him. His friendship with
such a man filled up what he knew to be a void in his own equipment
as citizen of the world. And the count was working&mdash;was
lying&mdash;for a worthy purpose: a daughter's dowry. For that
reason alone he was deserving of assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. van Koppen was unmarried. Knowing life as he did, from its
more seamy or mercenary side, he had never brought himself to
accept a single one of several hundred offers of marriage which had
been more or less overtly made to him&mdash;to his millions. He
loved the sex, as a whole; but distrusted them individually. He
thought he knew exactly what they were after. Pearl necklaces and
things. He was a good American; fond of bestowing pearl necklaces.
But he liked to give them when, and to whom, he fancied; he meant
to be his own master and to keep his painfully gotten millions
under his own control. All of which, far from extinguishing,
actually fostered that queer bachelor's feeling of reverential awe
for the married state and its results. Every form of courage and
success appealed to van Koppen&mdash;none more than the reckless
impetuosity of a man who speculates in such a delirious lottery and
sometimes actually draws a prize. Such had been Count Caloveglia's
portion. His marriage had plainly been a love-match; a success; its
result, this offspring&mdash;a daughter of whom any father might be
proud. Mr. van Koppen thoroughly understood the Count's position.
These Italians need dowries for their girls. Well, he should have
one! What did it signify? One pearl necklace the less, for some
operatic charmer. Not worth talking about. Among all h is various
benefactions, none was ever projected with a lighter heart, with
more sincere pleasure. It made him glad to be a millionaire.</p>

<p>All the details had been settled. The <i>Flutterby</i> was
sailing in a day or two. The relic would be brought on board, at
dead of night, by the faithful Andrea, who would return to the
Count with a cheque in his pocket. It was a considerable sum; so
considerable that Caloveglia had displayed great hesitation in
accepting it. But the millionaire pointed out that the parties must
be guided by Sir Herbert's opinion. What was the good, he asked, of
employing a specialist? Sir Herbert Street had declared the bronze
to be priceless, unique. His employer, therefore, insisted on
paying what the other had called "an adequate amount, if the value
of such a work of art can be expressed in monetary figures at all."
There was nothing more to be said. The Count gave way, with
graceful reluctance. A sham ancestry having been manufactured for
the masterpiece (it was proved to come from Asia Minor) in order to
elude the vigilance of the Italian Government, the Locri Faun could
thereafter be freely displayed to the American public, and Sir
Herbert Street was probably right in foretelling that it would be
the show piece of the millionaire's museum-artists and antiquarians
flocking to see it from every part of the world.</p>

<p>And Mr. van Koppen, as he drove along, was thinking of that
cheque; he was converting the dollars into francs. They made rather
an awkward sum. He decided to round it off, if only for the sake of
appearances; a further reason for not sending the cheque till the
last moment, together with a carefully worded letter to allay the
Count's scruples. The old fellow might otherwise return the
balance, in a fit of conscientiousness. Like himself, Count
Caloveglia was infernally, and very properly, punctilious&mdash;in
small matters.</p>

<p>Yes, there was some fun, at times, in being a millionaire. Or a
sculptor either, for that matter! For it evidently took some
doing&mdash;a little thing like that Locri Faun. It took some
doing. And it was worth doing: that was the main point. A man who
could bamboozle Sir Herbert Street&mdash;such a man deserved to be
supported. And what if the truth ultimately leaked out? Had he not
acted with the best intentions, under the written advice of an
expert? Far from feeling uneasy, Mr. van Koppen smiled at the
thought of how his millions, backed by the opinion of a connoisseur
of international reputation, had enabled him to play yet one more
trick upon that great Republic whose fathomless gullibility no one
had ever exploited to a better purpose than himself...</p>

</p>

<p>Mr. Eames was waiting for the bishop, according to
appointment.</p>

<p>"How about Mrs. Meadows?" he at once began.</p>

<p>"She was out, invisible. I waited nearly two hours and then
lunched with Count Caloveglia. By the way, have you seen anything
of Denis lately?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"The old man seemed to be concerned about him. He asked me to
make enquiries. Van Koppen thought that he might have got into
trouble with some girl. But that strikes me as very unlikely. He
may be a little homesick and lonely, so far from his mother."</p>

<p>The bibliographer said:</p>

<p>"I understand Mr. van Koppen is quite an authority on girls. As
to Denis, I saw him last&mdash;when was it? Oh, not so very long
ago. The day all those funny things happened; those portents. We
walked up and down together on this very terrace. Perhaps he has
left the island, like that wretched mineralogist who promised
me&mdash;never mind! He seemed all right then. A little depressed,
perhaps. Yes; a little depressed, no I come to think of it. But the
Count need not be anxious. This island is a great place for scares
and rumours."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard was not satisfied.</p>

<p>"Do you believe the influence of Nepenthe can make Northern
people irresponsible for their actions? Keith does. Or how about
the sirocco? Can it upset their nerves to such an extent?"</p>

<p>"Not my nerves. I have heard of people making fools of
themselves and then blaming the Creator. Often! And of course, if
one begins to brood over accidentals like the weather, one is sure
to become a lunatic sooner or later. Weather was not made for that
purpose. If you come to think of it, how few days there are when a
man can honestly say that the weather is quite to his liking! It is
nearly always too hot or too cold or too wet or too dry or too
windy. I don't trouble myself about sirocco. Why should Denis? He
is not nearly as much of a fool as many people look. And I would
not listen to Keith. He moves among hyperbolas."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard felt slightly relieved. What a sensible fellow this
was; so matter-of-fact and sure of his ground. The ideal scholar.
Sirocco did not exist for him. He stood aloof from human passions
and infirmities.</p>

<p>It was plain that the bishop had never heard that story about
the <i>ballon captif</i>.</p>

<p>"For my part," he said, "I am beginning to object to this south
wind. I never felt it worse than to-day. Phew! Stifling! One can
hardly breathe. My shirt is sticking to my back. Suppose we sit
down somewhere?"</p>

<p>They found a bench, in view of the sea and the volcano. The
population moved sedately up and down before their eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it always like this?" enquired Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>"Spring is a little warmer than usual. Or perhaps one should say
that summer has begun earlier. The sirocco is the same, year after
year, although there is a kind of conspiracy among the foreign
residents to say that it happens to be worse than usual that
particular season. It never varies."</p>

<p>"What does your Perrelli say on the subject?"</p>

<p>Mr. Eames glanced at him distrustfully.</p>

<p>"You are trying to chaff me," he said. "Serves me right for
talking so much this morning. I am afraid I bored you
dreadfully."</p>

<p>The bishop wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Then I may tell you that Monsignor Perrelli does not so much as
mention the South wind. He names all the others and has come
capital observations on the anchorages of the island as adapted to
different winds and seasons. He has also extracted from old
chronicles the records of the great storms of 1136, 1342, 1373,
1460, and so on; but never discloses the fact that they all blew
from the south. He says the air is pleasant, tempered by gentle
breezes from the sea. The word sirocco does not occur in his pages
save once, when he laments its prevalence on the mainland."</p>

<p>"The old humbug!"</p>

<p>A little shiver ran through Mr. Eames. Then he observed, in a
suave tone of voice:</p>

<p>"He was an historian of the period, an agreeable gentleman
telling others of his kind what he knows will be of interest to
them. That is what makes his work attractive to me: the personality
of the writer. The facts that he records, taken in conjunction with
those he slurs over or omits&mdash;they give one such an insight
into changing human nature! You can construct the character of a
man and his age not only from what he does and says, but from what
he fails to say and do."</p>

<p>"Modern historians are not like that," said Mr. Heard. "They
give you the truth to the best of their ability. It is rather dry
reading sometimes. I would like to borrow your Perrelli for a day
or two, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"I'll send it round, together with some old prints of this
island and modern photographs. You will then see what I mean. The
prints are not exactly true to nature; these people did not want to
be true to nature. And yet they convey a better impression of the
place than the modern pictures. Perhaps there are two truths: the
truth of fact and that of suggestion. Perrelli is very suggestive;
romance grafted upon erudition, and blossoming out of it! So
imaginative! He has a dissertation on the fishes of
Nepenthe&mdash;it reads like a poem and is yet full of practical
gastronomic hints. Can you picture Virgil collaborating with
Apicius?"</p>

<p>The bishop said:</p>

<p>"Horace might have got on better with that old
<i>bon-vivant</i>."</p>

<p>"Horace could never have had a hand in this chapter. He lacks
the idealistic tinge. He could never have written about red mullets
as Perrelli writes when he compares their skin to the fiery waves
of Phelgethon, to the mantle of rosy-fingered dawn, to the blush of
a maiden surprised in her bath, and then goes on to tell you how to
cook the b east in thirty different ways and how to spit out the
bones in the most noiseless, genteel fashion. That is
Perrelli&mdash;so original, so leisurely. Always himself! He smiled
as he wrote; there is not a shadow of doubt about it. In another
section, on the fountains of the island, he deliberately indulges
in the humour of some old mediaeval schoolman. Then there is a
chapter on the ecclesiastical conditions of the place under
Florizel the Fat&mdash;it is full of veiled attacks on the
religious orders of his own day; I suspect it got him into trouble,
that chapter. I am sorry to say there is a good deal of loose talk
scattered about his pages. I fear he was not altogether a
pure-minded man. But I cannot bring myself to despise him. What do
you think? Certain problems are always cropping up, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>Mr. Eames suddenly looked quite troubled.</p>

<p>"They are," replied the bishop, who was not in a mood to discuss
ethics just then. "What are you going to do about it?" he
added.</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"This poetic omission on the part of Perrelli to mention the
sirocco?"</p>

<p>"It has given me a deal of extra work, I can assure you. I have
had to go into the whole question. I have tabulated no less than
fifty-seven varieties of sirocco. Sailors' words, most of them;
together with a handful of antiquated terms. Fifty-seven varieties.
Twenty-three thousand words, up to the present, dealing the with
south wind."</p>

<p>"That is a fair-sized foot-note," laughed the bishop. "A good
slice of a book, I should call it."</p>

<p>"My foot-notes are to be printed in small type. In fact, I am
thinking of casting the whole of this sirocco&mdash;material into
an appendix. Too much, you think? Surely the number of words is not
disproportionate to the subject? The south wind is a good slice of
Nepenthe, is it not?... Look! That cloud has made up its mind to
come our way after all. There will be another shower of ashes.
Sirocco, you observe..."</p>

<p>The terrace, meanwhile, had become crowded. Already the evening
sun was slightly obscured behind a brown haze. Ashes were traveling
fast. They began to fall, softly.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Everybody, mindful of the previous
experience, was in favour of a second procession to take place
immediately. The <i>parroco</i> held the same opinion. For form's
sake, however, he dispatched a confidential messenger to learn the
views of Mr. Parker, who was sitting dejectedly in his study with
the incomplete Financial Report still staring him in the face. The
Commissioner pulled himself together with praiseworthy alacrity and
gave his whole mind to the question.</p>

<p>No. On due consideration, he was opposed to the idea of a
procession. Having enjoyed, in various continents and various
capacities, some experience of backing the same horse twice over,
Mr. Parker was not in favour of demanding a second largesse from
the Saint. It might spoil everything, he said. Let them wait till
next morning. If there was a deep fall like last time, the
experiment might be worth trying. But not just yet! While admitting
that something ought to be done, it struck him as a hazardous
proceeding to play fast and loose, in this fashion, with the
reputation of a Saint.</p>

<p>His Reverence, duly impressed, waited for half an hour. It was
then seen that the Nicaraguan Representative had once more given
the soundest of advice. The downpour of ashes ceased abruptly, at
the moment when the sun sank into the sea. No mischief was
done.</p>

<p>Late at night another phenomenon became visible. The volcano was
observed to be in violent eruption. It blazed forth like a gigantic
torch held into the heavens. Streams of lava poured down the
mountain flanks, reddening sky and sea.</p>

<p>Nepenthe was consoled by the spectacle. The demon had at last
found an outlet&mdash;a method of relief. There would be no more
showers of ashes. The fact that villages were being overwhelmed
under a deluge of flame, vineyards scorched and hundreds of
innocent folks, their retreat cut off by fiery torrents, were even
then being roasted to death, was no concern to the islanders. It
only proved what every one knew: that the jurisdiction of their
Patron Saint did not extend to the mainland.</p>

<p>Each of those villages had its own Saint, whose business it was
to forestall accidents of this kind. If they failed in their duty
through incapacity or mulishness, nothing was easier than to get
rid of them; there were others to choose from&mdash;dozens of
others, waiting for the job! Thinking thus, the islanders gave vent
to an immense sigh if relief. They wished long life to their Patron
Saint, with whose services they had reason to be satisfied. Their
own crops and lives were safe from harm, thanks to the martyr
Dodekanus. He loved his people, and they loved him. He was a
protector worthy of the name&mdash;not like those low-bred bastards
across the water.</p>

</p>

<p>Mr. Heard had just finished his early Italian luncheon. Sitting
at his coffee and smoking a cigarette, in a mood of considerable
contentment, he gazed over the mirror-like surface of the sea
towards the volcano, whose pyrotechnical display on the previous
evening had kept him awake to a late hour. Yet another glistering
day! Each one warmer than the last, and never a change in the wind!
Presently he would retire for an hour or two into his cool and
darkened bed-room.</p>

<p>One little thing troubled his mind. There had been no reply to
the note&mdash;a kind of note of enquiry&mdash;which he had left at
the villa Mon Repos on the preceding day. Though he knew little of
his cousin, he could not help feeling anxious. She was all by
herself in that lonely little place, suffering&mdash;perhaps, and
too proud or too shy to complain. Mr. Eames' description of her had
made him uneasy. Why should she look as if she had seen a ghost?
What could that signify? The bibliographer was a level-headed
person, by no means given to flights of imagination. Imperceptibly,
he felt, there had been established an under-current of sympathy
between himself and this solitary woman, whom everybody seemed to
like. She was different from the ordinary type; the kind of woman
whom a man could not help respecting. She contrasted favourably
with some of his recent female acquaintances who, however charming
or witty, dissatisfied him in this or that particular. His cousin's
devotion to child and husband appealed to his heart. She seemed to
be perfect of her kind.</p>

<p>Africa had boiled most of the starch out of Mr. Heard. But his
acquaintance with some of the saddest and wildest aspects of
womanhood only deepened his conviction of the sanctity of the sex.
Some called him old-fashioned or quixotic, because he was not
altogether in sympathy with modern feministic movements; they
called him an idealist, because he had preserved his belief in the
sacred mission of women upon earth&mdash;his childlike faith in the
purity of their souls. They were a humanizing influence, the
guardian angels of mankind, the inspirers, the mothers, the
protectors of innocence. It pleased him to think that woman had
softened harsh dealings between man and man; that every mitigation
of savagery, every incitement to worthy or heroic actions, was due
to her gentle words, her encouraging example. From the very dawn of
history woman had opposed herself to deeds of violence. What was it
Count Caloveglia had said? "Temperance. All the rest is
embroidery." How well the old man could put things! Temperance...
His cousin, from what he could guess of her character, agreed with
that description. Mr. Heard would have maintained against the whole
world that a woman, a true woman like this, could do no wrong.</p>

<p>And now he gathered that she was in trouble of some kind. Then
why not allow him to help? He had asked for an early reply to his
note. Well, perhaps it would arrive by the evening post.</p>

<p>Slightly vexed none the less, he laid down the stump of his
cigarette, preparatory to retiring for the hot hours of the day.
One owes something to oneself, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>? At that moment
there was a knock at his door.</p>

<p>Denis entered. His face, shaded under a broad-brimmed hat, was
ruddy with the heat. He wore light flannels, and was carrying his
jacket on his arm. There was a large parcel in his hand. He looked
the picture of health.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, on rising, gave him a critical glance. He remembered
his trip in the boat, and the suicide's rock&mdash;that black,
ominous cliff; he remembered the thoughts which had passed through
his mind at the time. Was this the kind of boy to kill himself?
Surely not. Keith must have been mistaken. And Count
Caloveglia&mdash;was he mistaken too? Evidently. There was nothing
tragic about Denis. He was brimming over with life. His troubles,
whatever they were, must have been forgotten.</p>

<p>"I've been lunching with Keith," he began. "He made me tell him
a fairy-tale."</p>

<p>"Sit down and have some coffee! You came away very early."</p>

<p>"He told me he wanted to go to sleep after luncheon. And one or
two other nice things."</p>

<p>Ah, thought Mr. Heard, Keith was acting up to what he had said
in the boat; he was being good to the boy; that was right of
him.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," he said, "that Keith has been speaking kindly to
you."</p>

<p>"Kindly? It's like talking to an earthquake. He told me to
dominate my reflexes. He called me a perambulating echo. He said I
was a human amoeba&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Amoeba. What's that?"</p>

<p>"A sort of animal that floats about trying to attach itself to
something which it can't find."</p>

<p>"I think I see what he means. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"He said I was a chameleon."</p>

<p>"A chameleon!"</p>

<p>"A chameleon that needed the influence of a good woman. Then he
gave me this box of Cuban chocolates, to keep me from crying, I
suppose. Have one! They're not nearly as nasty as they look."</p>

<p>"Thanks. A chameleon. That is really interesting, as Keith would
say. I have seen thousands of them. Outlandish beasts, that anchor
themselves by their tails and squint horribly. Let's have a look at
you, Denis. No, I fail to detect any striking resemblance."</p>

<p>"I believe he meant that I take on the colour of other people
and have none of my own. Then he told me to go and murder
somebody."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that, Denis," laughed the bishop. "Murders are so
dreadfully vulgar."</p>

<p>"He said it might make a man of me. He forgets that I'm not
quite his age."</p>

<p>"You had better not tell him that! Any other advice?"</p>

<p>"Nothing new. He said I made a mistake in paying attention to
what human beings said and did, and that I ought to forsake mankind
for a while, and art and books and so on. You know the way he
talks! He said it would give me a stronger individuality if I came
into contact with nature and thought things out for myself instead
of listening to other people. He advised me to sit among the rocks
at midnight and in the hot afternoons, conversing with the genii of
earth and air. It would correct my worldly perspective. I think he
may be right, in a way. There is something in it. So I asked him to
climb into the hills with me, then and there, in order to get into
touch with elemental Powers. He said he thought highly of my
character, but as to climbing about in this heat&mdash;he said he'd
be damned if he would. Those were his very words. He wanted to
sleep. He was too old for that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Very sensible, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"You think so? Because then&mdash;then he told me that you were
the proper person for an expedition of that kind. He suggested I
should come and see you about it at once&mdash;it would allow him
time to get his usual afternoon nap. That is why I'm here. So do!
It isn't so very hot, once you get used to it. We are sure to see
something funny."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>This, thought the bishop, was a pretty example of that doctrine
of benevolent egotism which Keith had expounded to him once or
twice. A very pretty example!</p>

<p>"He said that?"</p>

<p>Denis nodded.</p>

<p>The notion was distasteful to Mr. Heard. To go out into this
torrid sunshine...He, too, was not exactly young; moreover, he was
still rather delicate&mdash;he needed all the rest he could get. He
was looking forward with positive delight to the coming hours in
his cool bedroom.</p>

<p>"You really want me to climb to the top of a mountain at this
hour of the day and sit there in the heat, waiting for some
wretched demon to reveal himself? Aren't you a little too old for
that sort of thing? Come now! Does it strike you as a reasonable
proposition? With the thermometer at seventy-eight in this
room?"</p>

<p>"Keith said you liked nothing better. He said you might take
offence if I didn't ask you to come."</p>

<p>He seemed to be disappointed.</p>

<p>There were not many people for whom Mr. Heard would have put
himself out just then in that particular way; and Denis, up to a
few days ago, was certainly not one of them. The bishop had never
been drawn towards this rather precious youth. He was not Mr.
Heard's type of boy. There was a lack of grit and stamina about
him&mdash;something soft, both in manner and appearance; something
dreamy, ambiguous, almost epicene. Mr. Heard had not quite lost his
old British instinct as to the fundamental uselessness of all art.
A young fellow who, instead of taking up some rational profession,
talked about Cimabue and Jacopo Bellini...there was something not
quite right with him. Jacopo Bellini! But even while thinking what
to reply, he was conscious of having undergone a slight change of
feeling lately. He was growing more tolerant and benign, even in
trifles like this. Jacopo Bellini: why not? Meanwhile, he bethought
himself of a way of escape.</p>

<p>"Suppose you go alone? Or why not try the midnight expedition
first? I might manage midnight."</p>

<p>"I've tried it."</p>

<p>"Alone?" he laughed. "No success?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said Denis. And it seemed as if a shadow
flitted across his face at these words.</p>

<p>That cloud, that change of tone&mdash;what did they portend?
Something might be wrong, then, after all. Perhaps Keith had been
correct in his diagnosis when he observed that a susceptible mind
like this could be shaken out of its equilibrium by the influence
of Nepenthe&mdash;"capable of anything in this clear pagan light."
It was not Mr. Heard's habit to probe into the feelings of
others&mdash;as to those of a person like Denis he did not pretend
to understand them. Artistic people! Incalculable! Inconsequential!
Irresponsible! Quite another point of view! Yet he could not help
thinking of that doleful black rock, with the turquoise-tinted
water at its foot. Remembering these things he felt a sudden access
of sympathy towards this lonesome fellow-creature. Instead of
pursuing the subject of the expedition he asked, quite
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Denis, are you happy here?"</p>

<p>"How odd that you should come with that question! I had a letter
from my mother this morning. She wants to know the same thing. And
hanged if I know what to say."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Hanged if you know? Then I'll tell you. Write to say that you
have met the Bishop of Bampopo, who seems a perfectly respectable
old fellow. Uncommonly respectable! Tell her you rather like him.
Tell her she can find out all about him in Crockford or the Red
Book. Tell her that he will be happy to correspond with her, if she
will allow it. Tell her you feel sure he will look after you these
last few days, before we all go away. Tell her&mdash;oh, everything
nice you can think of. You'll do that, won't you? And now I will
climb any mountain you like. Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of a good place. Rather high up, but well worth
it. I feel sure something funny is going to happen to-day. Don't
you notice a kind of demonic influence in the air?"</p>

<p>"I notice a kind of infernal heat, if that is the same thing.
Seventy-eight in this room! You will have to walk slowly. I am not
in good condition just yet. Wait a moment. I must take my
field-glasses. I never go without them."</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, resigned to his fate, was filled at the same time
with anxiety. He could not drive Keith's words out of his head.
Perhaps Denis was really up to some mischief. Who could tell? His
eagerness&mdash;his curious language! That note of exaltation in
his voice...And what did he mean by saying that something funny
would happen? Was he contemplating&mdash;? Above all, his dread of
being unaccompanied! Mr. Heard was aware that persons of unbalanced
mind are apt to experience before some critical outbreak a pathetic
horror of solitude, as though, dimly conscious of what was about to
happen, they feared to trust themselves alone.</p>

<p>He meant to keep a sharp eye on Denis.</p>

<p>Often, in later times, he recalled that trivial conversation.
Every word of it was graven on his memory. How more than strange
that Denis should have dragged him away that afternoon, to that
particular spot, at that very hour! By what a string of accidents
had everything happened...</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c41.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock. To step out of doors was like passing
into a furnace. Streets were deserted. The houses showed glaring
white against the cobalt of the firmament; their inhabitants lay
asleep within, behind closed shutters. Heat and silence brooded
over the land.</p>

<p>Climbing slowly aloft by a lava-paved lane they reached the
bibliographer's residence and paused awhile near its entrance. Mr.
Heard tried to picture the scholar's life in this two-roomed
cottage; he regretted having had no chance of visiting that amiable
person in his own abode. (Mr. Eames was chary of issuing
invitations.) A life of monastic severity. There was a small
outhouse attached to one side of the wall; it was the kitchen,
Denis explained; Eames' only servant being a boy whom he borrowed
for an occasional morning's work from a neighbouring farm which
supplied him with dairy produce.</p>

<p>"It isn't often used, that kitchen," said Denis. "He lives
mostly on bread and milk. Does his own marketing in the early
hours. I met him one day before breakfast, walking with a large
brown basket on his arm. Said he was buying anchovies. There was a
big haul of them overnight. He had heard about it. A penny a pound,
he said. I noticed some lettuce as well. A couple of oranges. Fine
chap! He knows what he wants."</p>

<p>The bishop looked over the gate. An air of friendly seclusion
reigned in this place. There was no pretence at a garden&mdash;not
so much as a rose tree or a snapdragon; the vines, of daintiest
green but sternly utilitarian, clambered up to the door-lintel,
invading the very roof. He pictured to himself the interior. Bare
walls and floorings, a print or two, a few trunks and packing cases
utilized as seats, a bookshelf, a plain table littered with
manuscripts; somewhere, in that further room, a camp bedstead
whereon this man of single aim and purpose, this monk of
literature, was even then at rest like all sensible folks, and
dreaming&mdash;dreaming, presumably, of foot-notes. Happy mortal!
Free from all superfluities and encumbrances of the flesh! Enviable
mortal! He reduced earthly existence to its simplest and most
effective terms; he owed no man anything; he kept alive, on a
miserable income, the sacred flame of enthusiasm. To aspire, that
was the secret of life. Thinking thus, Mr. Heard began to
understand the bibliographer's feeling for Mrs. Meadows. She lived
for her child&mdash;he for his work. They were alike; calm and
self-contained, both of them; incapable of illusions, of excesses
in thought or conduct.</p>

<p>Without the doorway, in a small triangle of shade, sat is
fox-terrier, alert, head poised on one side in knowing fashion,
ready to bark if the visitors only touched the handle of the gate.
Denis remarked:</p>

<p>"He told me that dog was sick the other morning, just like
Keith."</p>

<p>"It had probably been eating something. I suppose they couldn't
be unwell, could they? What a heat, Denis! It's addling my old
brains. More slowly, please."</p>

<p>An hour went by. Fatigue was beginning to tell upon Mr. Heard.
They had left he cultivated ground behind and were now ascending,
by a cindery track of pumice-stone, among grotesque blocks of lava
and scoriae that glowed like molten metal. Tufts of flowery broom
scented the air. The soil, so recently drenched by the miraculous
shower of rain, was once more dry and dusty; its fragile flowers
wilted in the sirocco. And still the young man marched ahead.
Always upwards! The landscape grew more savage. They bent round a
corner and gound themselves skirting a precipice. The bishop
glanced down in trepidation. There lay the sea, with not a boat in
sight. As he continued to look the horizon oscillated; the ground
sank under his feet and blue waters seemed to heave and rise up
towards him. He shut his eyes in a fit of dizziness and grasped a
rock. Its burning touch revived him.</p>

<p>Then on again. Always upwards.</p>

<p>"Do walk a little more slowly," said the bishop, puffing and
wiping his face. "We must be well above the level of the Old Town
by this time. A wild scramble. How much higher are we going?"</p>

<p>"Here we are. This is the place I meant."</p>

<p>"Charming, I must say! But aren't we a little too near the edge
of the cliff? It makes me feel funny, as if I were in a
balloon."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get used to it. Let's sit down, Mr. Heard."</p>

<p>Still distrustful of his companion, the bishop made himself
comfortable and glanced around. They were high up; the view
embraced half the island. The distant volcano confronting him was
wreathed in sullen grey smoke that rose up from its lava torrent,
and crowned with a menacing vapour-plume. Then an immensity of sea.
At his feet, separated from where he sat by wide stony tracts
tremulous with heat, lay the Old Town, its houses nestling in a
bower of orchards and vineyards. It looked like a shred of
rose-tinted lace thrown upon he landscape. He unraveled those now
familiar thoroughfares and traced out, as a map, the more prominent
buildings&mdash;the Church, the Municipality, the old Benedictine
Monastery where Duke Alfred, they say, condescendingly invited
himself to dine with the monks every second month in such state and
splendour that, the rich convent revenues being exhausted, His
Highness was pleased to transfer his favours to the neighboring
Carthusians who went bankrupt in their turn; he recognized Count
Caloveglia's place and, at the furthest outskirts, the little villa
Mon Repos.</p>

<p>Where was she now, his cousin?</p>

<p>Reposing, no doubt, like all sensible folks.</p>

<p>And his eye wandered to the narrow pathway along the precipice
where he had walked with her in the evening light&mdash;that
pathway which he had suggested railing in, by reason of its
dangers. A section of the horrible face of the cliff was exposed,
showing that ominous coloration, as though splotched with blood,
which he had noticed from the boat. The devil's rock! An
appropriate name. "Where the young English lord jump over..."</p>

<p>It was the stillest hour of the day. Not a soul in sight. Not a
particle of shade. Not a breath of air. A cloudless sky of inky
blueness.</p>

<p>To Mr. Heard's intense relief Denis had settled down, apparently
for ever. He lay on his stomach like a lizard, immovable. His head,
sheltered by a big hat, rested upon his jacket which he had rolled
up into a sort of cushion; one bare sunburnt arm was stretched to
its full length on the seared ground. What a child he was, to drag
one up to a place like this in the expectation of seeing something
unearthly! Mr. Heard was not quite satisfied about him. Perhaps he
was only feigning.</p>

<p>Time passed. Do what he would to keep awake, the bishop felt his
eyelids drooping&mdash;closing under the deluge of light. Once more
there approached him that spirit of malevolence brooding in the
tense sunny calm, that baleful emanation which seemed to drain away
his powers of will. It laid a weight upon him. He felt into an
unquiet slumber.</p>

<p>Presently he woke up and turned sharply to look at his
companion. Denis had not stirred an inch from his voluptuous pose.
A queer boy. Was he up to some mystification?</p>

<p>The landscape all around was scarred and deserted. How silent a
place can be, he thought. An unhealthy hush. And what a heat! The
lava blocks&mdash;they seemed to smoulder and reel in the fiery
glare. It was a deathly world. It reminded him of those
illustrations to Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. He thought to see the
figures of the damned writhing amid tongues of flame.</p>

<p>His glance fell once more upon the villa of his cousin. Strange!
There were two persons, now, walking along the edge of the cliff.
Mere specks...He took up his glasses. The specks resolved
themselves into the figures of Mrs. Meadows and Mr. Muhlen.</p>

<p>The devil! he thought. What's the meaning of this?</p>

<p>They were moving up and down, at the same spot where he had
moved up and down with her. They seemed to be on friendly terms
with one another. Excellent terms. It looked as if they were
laughing now and then, and stopping occasionally to glance at
something, some book or other object, which the lady carried in her
hand. The devil! At times his cousin seemed to be dangerously near
the edge&mdash;he caught his breath, remembering that sensation of
giddiness, of gulping terror, with which he had watched the falcon
swaying crazily over the abyss. She was enjoying it, to all
appearances. Then, as they retraced their steps, it was the man's
turn to take the outside of the path. He suffered as little as she
did, evidently, from vertigo. Laughing, and gesticulating. The
devil! What were they talking about? What were they doing there, at
this impossible hour of the day? Five or six times they went to and
fro; and then, suddenly, something happened before Mr. Heard's
eyes&mdash;something unbelievable.</p>

<p>He dropped his glasses, but quickly raised them again. There was
no doubt about it. Muhlen was no longer there. He had disappeared.
Mrs. Meadows was walking down towards her villa, in sprightly
fashion, alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard felt sick. Not knowing exactly what he was about, he
began to shake Denis with needless violence. The young man turned
round lazily, flushed in the face.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;what&mdash;" he began. "Rather funny! You saw it
too? Oh, Lord! You've woke me up. What a bother...Why, Mr. Heard,
what's the matter with you? Aren't you feeling well?"</p>

<p>The bishop pulled himself together, savagely.</p>

<p>"Touch of the sun, I daresay. Africa, you know! Perhaps we ought
to be going. Give me your arm, Denis, like a good boy. I want to
get down."</p>

<p>He was dazed in mind, and his steps faltered. But his brain was
sufficiently clear to realize that his was face to face with an
atrocious and carefully planned murder.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34</h2>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c42.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>All the traditions of his race, the uprightness of ages of
decent law-abiding culture, the horror of the pure for what is
impure rebelled against this thing which nothing but the testimony
of his own eyes could have made him believe. He felt humiliated, as
though he had received a blow; inclined to slink about and hide his
face from other men. There was contamination in the mere fact of
having been a witness. Oh, it was villainous. How carefully the
hour and place had been chosen!</p>

<p>And he himself, during that evening walk, had given her the
idea. He had said how easily a man could be thrown over at that
spot. Very simple...</p>

<p>His mind would clear up, maybe, in course of time. Meanwhile he
remembered about Retlow&mdash;<i>alias</i> Muhlen. It came to him
in a flash. The man was his cousin's first husband; possibly her
only legal husband, seeing that she may not have been able to
secure sufficient evidence against him to justify a
divorce&mdash;had, indeed, lost sight of the scoundrel altogether
for several years prior to her elopement with young Meadows. It
might well be that Muhlen had heard somehow or other of her
presence on Nepenthe, and gone there for the purpose of renewing
acquaintance with her. But this foul crime! For it cannot have been
a sudden impulse on her part. She had been playing with
him&mdash;leading him on. His visits to the Old Town, at that quiet
hour of the day...No. She had carried out her infamous plan after
ample premeditation.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard stayed at home, burdened with a hideous secret.
Practical questions began to assail him. What should he do? Wait!
he concluded. Something would be sure to turn up. He was too dazed
to think clearly, as yet. He also disliked that fellow. But one
does not murder a man because one happens to dislike him. One does
not murder a man...foolish words, that kept on repeating themselves
in his mind.</p>

<p>To pardon&mdash;yes. Mr. Heard could pardon to any extent. The
act of pardoning: what did it imply? Nothing more than that poor
deluded mortals were ever in need of sympathy and guidance. Anybody
could pardon. To pardon was not enough for a man of Mr. Heard's
ruthless integrity. He must understand. How understand, how
interpret, a dastardly deed like this? What could her motives have
been? Of what act of proposal could the man have been guilty to
merit, even in her eyes, a fate such as this? For evidently, one
does not murder a man because one happens to dislike him&mdash;</p>

<p>Denis came to enquire, in the course of the morning. He was
anxious to know how the bishop was feeling after yesterday's attack
of sunstroke.</p>

<p>"I have been blaming myself bitterly for dragging you out," he
began. "I&mdash;really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think about it! I shall be better soon. I'll remain
indoors to-day."</p>

<p>"You are not looking quite yourself just yet. What a fool I was!
I can't tell you how sorry I am."</p>

<p>"Not worth talking about. You'll stay to luncheon?"</p>

<p>The news of Muhlen's disappearance was spread about that same
evening, and created no surprise whatever. Foreigners had a knack
of coming to the island and mysteriously vanishing again; it was
quite the regular thing to run up accounts all around and then
clear out. Hotel-keepers, aware of this idiosyncrasy on the part of
distinguished guests, arranged their scale of charges accordingly;
they made the prices so high that the honest paid for the
dishonest, as with English tailors. The other tradespeople of the
place&mdash;the smiling confectioner, the simple-minded bootmaker
and good-natured stationer, the ever-polite hosier&mdash;they all
worked on the same principle. They recouped themselves by fleecing
the more ingenuous of their clients.</p>

<p>In the case of Muhlen's occultation there was even less surprise
than usual. Everybody, judging by his lavish display of gold and
showy manner, expected him to depart sooner or later in the
orthodox manner&mdash;at night-time, by means of a sailing boat
secretly hired, conscientiously prepaid. His more intimate friends,
the Magistrate and the Commissioner, were less surprised than
anyone else. True, Signore Malipizzo was somewhat hurt, because
Muhlen had practically invited him to stay at his own native town
where every kind of amusement was to be had, the female society
being of the choicest. Exuberant women&mdash;and rich! It would
have been a pleasant change after the trim but tedious gardens of
Salsomaggiore. He had strong homes, however, of receiving a letter
from some safe place outside the dominions, making an appointment
for the holidays. For form's sake, of course, he promptly initiated
the ordinary judicial enquiries. It would look well in the records
of the Court.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Parker, who was brooding in the retirement of his
villa whither the news had swiftly spread, he merely thought:</p>

<p>"Got off scot free. And without paying his Club account, I'll
bet. Bolted. Lucky devil. That's where the casual visitor has the
pull over a resident official like myself. Cleared out! I'm glad I
never had any money to lend him. Touched a good few of them, I'll
be bound."</p>

<p>Within an hour or so of the magistrate's formal enquiries led to
a startling discovery. Muhlen's room in the hotel was broken open,
and his property searched. No letters could be found conveying any
clue as to his whereabouts. But&mdash;what was almost
incredible&mdash;there was loose money lying about. A more minute
investigation proved that the gentleman had dressed himself with
considerable care prior to leaving the establishment for the last
time. He had changed his socks and other underwear&mdash;yes, he
had donned a clean shirt. The old one, blue-striped, which he had
been seen to wear at breakfast, was lying negligently across the
back of a chair with a pair of costly enameled links, of azure
colour to match, in the cuffs. Moreover, in a small box hidden
beneath some collars in a drawer were found a few foreign
bank-notes, a ring or two, and a handful of gold coins such as he
was in the habit of carrying about his person. The judge, who
superintended the researches, caused these valuables to be
impounded, sealed, and deposited in the Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The discovery put a fresh and ominous complexion on the affair.
When a man means to bolt, he does not leave portable
jewelry&mdash;an enameled pair of links&mdash;behind him. And even
if, in the hurry and scurry of departure, he does overlook such
elegant trifles, he never forgets to take his money; least of all a
man like Muhlen.</p>

<p>A lengthy deposition was signed by the hotel proprietor. It set
forth, in reference to Muhlen's general habits, that this gentleman
had hitherto not attended to his account; he had not been urgently
pressed for a settlement. One did not like to incommode foreign
visitors with bills; it annoyed them so much that they sometimes
migrated to other hotels and made debts there, debts which in
certain unexpected cases were liquidated in full while the former
and equally legitimate ones remained unpaid&mdash;which was
disheartening. In regard to his recent mode of life, the document
contained the suggestive fact that Muhlen had not taken his midday
meal at the hotel for some time past. He was strangely fond of
going out in the late mornings, the proprietor averred; it might
be, to bathe; he returned at about five in the afternoon after
lunching, presumably, in some small restaurant by the shore.</p>

<p>This declaration, signed by a respected citizen, soon leaked
into publicity. Taken in conjunction with the discovery of his
money it was an eye-opener to the whole community, and to nobody
more than to the judge himself. Signor Malipizzo argued, with his
usual penetration, that Muhlen had intended to return to his
quarters as he had always done of late. The <i>animus
revertendi</i> was abundantly proven by the sleeve-links and loose
cash. He had not returned. Ergo, something untoward had happened.
Untoward things may be divided, for the sake of convenience, into
two main classes, sections, or categories:</p>

<p>1. Accidents. 2. Foul play.</p>

<p>Which was it?</p>

<p>Signor Malipizzo dismissed as untenable the hypothesis of a
clandestine withdrawal from local creditors. By way of clearing up
the last vestige of doubt, however, and also for the sake of
appearances (seeing that a wise magistrate is supposed to take
nothing for granted) he called for depositions for the sailors and
fishermen. It was a superfluous piece of work, a pure formality; he
knew beforehand what they would say. They always said the same
thing. They said it. Interrogated on oath they declared, one and
all, that no person answering to the description of Muhlen had
appeared on the beach for a long time; not for the last eight
months and twelve days, to be quite accurate; much less had such a
one engaged a vessel. The jovial but conservative sea-folk never
varied their utterance on those many solemn occasions when a
foreigner, for the purpose of evaporating, paid in advance for the
hire of a boat, or was supposed to have done so. Albeit even
ignorant people attached no significance to this statement, it went
for what it was worth as cumulative evidence.</p>

<p>The sight of that loose cash would have been quite enough for a
man of Signor Malipizzo's discernment. Muhlen had not bolted. Nor
was he the kind of man to lose his life by an accident. Not he!
Muhlen was careful of his skin. Ergo, his disappearance was due to
something which came under the second class, section, or category.
He had been done away with.</p>

<p>The magistrate, thinking of those summer holidays, began to be
really vexed; so did Mr. Parker, who soon learned the result of
these enquiries and regretted that his mourning retirement
prevented him from issuing forth and telling everybody what he
thought of this new disgraceful scandal. His English blood revolted
at the idea of a harmless tourist, a prominent member of the Alpha
and Omega Club, being callously murdered. Would these people never
get civilized? He was glad to hear, at all events, that the judge
was doing something.</p>

<p>Signor Malipizzo was doing a good deal. He meant to sift the
thing to the bottom. His energy, hitherto simulated, was now set
genuinely at work to discover indications of the
murderer&mdash;indications of his missing friend. But Nepenthe is
not a good place for finding corpses. The island is full of
fathomless rents and fissures. A good many foreigners, especially
such as were known to carry loose gold in their pockets, had been
suspected of falling into them without leaving a trace behind. Yet
a thorough search was instituted, for he knew that criminals were
not always as clever as they thought themselves; some insignificant
relic might turn up&mdash;a shred of clothing or so forth. Such
things were occasionally picked up on Nepenthe; nobody knew to whom
they belonged. The Cave of Mercury, on being searched, yielded
nothing but a trouser button, apparently of English manufacture.
Enquiries were also made as to when the ill-starred gentleman had
last been seen, and where. Finally, the judge drew up a list, a
fairly long list, of all the suspicious characters on the place
with a view to placing them under lock and key, in expectation of
further developments. Such was the customary procedure; one must
assume the worst. If innocent, they might of course regain their
liberty in a year or two.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that a good many people had noticed Muhlen
on the morning of his disappearance. One cannot walk about Nepenthe
at that hour of the day without being seen, and Muhlen was
sufficiently conspicuous. But everyone knew what was in store for
him if he admitted such a fact, to wit, an application of paragraph
43 of the 92nd section of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according
to which any and every witness of this kind is liable to be
segregated from his family and kept under arrest for an indefinite
length of time, pending the instruction of a trial which might take
half a century. Nobody, therefore, was fool enough to admit having
encountered him&mdash;nobody save a half-witted youth who fatuously
confided to a policeman that the had met the gentleman somewhere in
the neighbourhood of the bibliographer's villa about the hour of
midday. Under ordinary circumstances Signor Malipizzo would have
been delighted to lay sacrilegious hands on Mr. Eames, whose
Olympic aloofness had always annoyed him and against whom a case
could now be got up, on the strength of these indications.
Somewhere in the neighbourhood of the villa&mdash;that was quite
sufficient to warrant an arrest.</p>

<p>The boy in question happened to be a relation of his arch-enemy,
the parish priest. Better still. Chuckling at the happy
coincidence, he forgot all about Mr. Eames, and gave orders for the
other to be conveyed to the guard-house, searched, and
interrogated, arguing plausibly that a person of his mental
instability would be sure to give himself away by some stupid
remark.</p>

<p>Things turned out better than he had dared to hope. Under the
prisoner's clothing was discovered a gold coin of foreign
nationality attached, by a piece of string, round his neck. For all
one knew, it might have been Muhlen's. The interrogating carbineer
who is invested, during such preliminary enquiries, with
quasi-judicial functions&mdash;being permitted to assume the role
of prosecuting or defending counsel, or to remain sternly unbiased,
as he feels inclined&mdash;desired to learn how he had come by this
jewel.</p>

<p>He received it long ago from his mother, he said, as a talisman
against the moonsickness which had tormented him in childhood.
Replying, in stammering and dazed fashion, to further questions, he
gave it to be understood that nobody had ever set eyes on the coin
in question; he was afraid of showing it, lest someone should take
it from him by force. He loved the coin. He got it from his
mother.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the friendly policeman. "And your mother,
now&mdash;could she perhaps tell us when she gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"My mother is in Paradise."</p>

<p>"Dead, is she? H'm. That looks queer, my young friend. Very
fishy. You should be more careful in little things like that. She
ought to have been kept alive, you know. Anybody can say they had
gold coins given them by dead mothers, don't you see? Rather a thin
trick. Can't you suggest something better? Cheer up, boy! You
needn't tremble all over. Look, I am writing it down, and you must
put your name to it afterwards. Think&mdash;little. A living uncle,
for instance&mdash;if he came into Court and testified that he had
given you the coin, why, it might make all the difference and get
you out of a nasty scrape. Surely you've got an uncle or something?
How about His Reverence the <i>parroco</i>? Couldn't he
swear&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"My mother is in Paradise."</p>

<p>"In Paradise, is she? That's where you ought to be, my son. Just
sign this declaration, please. Then perhaps you will meet your
mother sooner than you expect. Can't read or write? Well, put your
cross to it and may the Madonna help you! For I can't. I've done my
best to be impartial, but God alone can steer a fool. He makes a
specialty of it, they tell me. If so, you've got a sporting
chance..."</p>

</p>

<p>Overjoyed with this incriminating deposition, His Worship gave
orders for the prisoner's formal arrest. Aloud he remarked:</p>

<p>"What have I always said? Beware of wimple folks. They are the
deep ones. Their naivete is nothing but a disguise. Here we have a
case in point. This boy, from all accounts, is the pure type of the
callous murderer. He stutters. He makes uncalled-for gurglings of a
bestial nature. He has pendulous ears, and certain other stigmata
of degeneration which are familiar to all conversant with criminal
anthropology. Of course he denies everything. But mark my words!
After six or seven months, when the prison diet begins to take
effect, he will confess. I know the species; it is all too common.
Meanwhile we must congratulate ourselves on having tracked down the
culprit so soon."</p>

<p>To condemn for homicide the cousin of a Catholic priest warmed
the cockles of his free-thinking heart. In fact, on second
thoughts, it was better than if he had caught the real murderer who
might have turned out to be an atheist, which would have been bad
enough&mdash;or possibly a freemason, which would have been really
awkward. The news spread rapidly over the island, and caused wild
rejoicings among the anti-clericals.</p>

<p>The rejoicings were of brief duration.</p>

<p>Torquemada, as usual, was in fighting trim. Like all God-fearing
ascetics, he was a man-eater at heart. He made up his mind long ago
to eat the judge, whom he considered an offence to Heaven and
earth&mdash;the official mouthpiece of the devil. Up to the present
he had bided his time, waiting for a good opportunity. The time was
now ripe.</p>

<p>Not that he greatly loved his cousin. The family to which the
unhappy youth belonged was of no credit or use to himself, and this
particular member was worse than useless, being afflicted with an
unpardonable vice&mdash;lack of judgment. His stupidity had already
got him into a number of minor scrapes. As a child he annoyed
foreigners by ingenuous requests for money, stole flowers from
neighbours' gardens because they were so irresistibly pretty, tied
saucepans to their cats because they had such irresistibly long
tails and made such irresistibly droll movements and noises in
order to get rid of them, frightened old ladies by making faces at
them; sometimes, by way of a change, he threw off a fit; later on,
he had taken to smashing crockery, mooning about the vineyards,
forgetting errands entrusted to him, throwing stones at passing
carriages and making a general nuisance of himself. The
<i>parroco</i> knew that he had been dismissed as incompetent by
tradespeople to whom he was apprenticed, by farmers who had
employed him as a labourer. He could not even repeat his Ave Maria
without producing sinister crepitations from his gullet. And now he
had crowned all by this surpassing act of imprudence. If he had
only kept his mouth shut, like everybody else. But there! What
could you expect from a fool?</p>

<p>A genuine murderer&mdash;it was most irreligious, of course.
Still, some homicides were fairly justifiable, others almost
meritorious; and a criminal of this kind showed, in every case,
undeniable traces of manliness; one could not help respecting him
in an oblique sort of fashion. But a fool! Torquemada, the zealous
priest, the man of God, could never quite repress the promptings of
his blood. He had all the fanatic's appreciation of violent
methods; all the Southerner's fondness for a miscreant, and
contempt for a simpleton. A mere fool&mdash;what's the use of him
on earth? Had the culprit been any ordinary Christian, His
Reverence would not have dreamt of interfering; gladly would he
have let him spend the remainder of his day sin prison which
everybody knew to be the best place for stupid people&mdash;it kept
them out of mischief.</p>

<p>But this was not an ordinary Christian. He was a relation. A
relation! That meant that one must show fight for him, if only for
the sake of public appearances.</p>

<p>He held a hurried council with his family and, half an hour
later, a second one with the more influential members of the
priesthood. It was decided, in both cases, that the occasion was
favourable for a long-deferred contest between the Powers of Light
and the powers of darkness, the Catholic Church and modernism, the
Clergy of Nepenthe and the secular authority of law and order as
personified by that judge in whom all evil, public and private,
flowed together. A noble parting cheque which he had just received
from Mr. van Koppen for some urgent repairs to the parish organ
came in handy. It would enable him to face the adversary with good
hopes of success. To his friends he said:</p>

<p>"An insult to my family! I shall not take it lying down. Let
them see what a humble servant of God can do."</p>

<p>So saying, he girded his loins for the fray, walked in person to
the post office and wrote out a lengthy telegram to the redoubtable
Don Giustino Morena, the parliamentary representative of Nepenthe
who, as readers of the newspapers were aware, happened to be taking
a brief holiday among his own people in the South. It was a
judiciously flattering dispatch. It prayed the famous
lawyer-politician to undertake the defence of a relation, an
orphan, a mere child, unjustly accused of murder and arbitrarily
imprisoned, and to deign to accept a pitiful honorarium of five
thousand francs&mdash;the largest sum which a parish priest, poor
but jealous of the honour of his family, could scrape together. If
the great man accepted the offer, he might arrive by the nest day's
boat. There was a chance, thought the <i>parroco</i>, of his doing
so. Don Giustino was an ardent Catholic; he might be favourably
impressed by the modest petition of a clergyman in his
constituency. He had promised over and over again to visit his
Nepenthean constituents. He would now be killing two birds with one
stone.</p>

<p>Five minutes, under ordinary circumstances, were wont to elapse
ere an item of private news could percolate out of the post office
and become public property. Such was the portentous import of this
message that it did not percolate at all. It flashed, and produced
forthwith a feeling of joyous elation at the prospect of lively
events in the near future&mdash;of a battle between the Vatican and
the Quirinal. Coming on the top of Muhlen's murder&mdash;which was
a decided improvement upon his alleged flight&mdash;it caused the
citizens to talk in excited and almost random fashion about what
was coming next. Alone, the members of the Alpha and Omega Club,
thanks to the benign influence of Parker's poison, received the
successive waves of information with composure, and preserved from
beginning to end their sense of proportion.</p>

<p>"Heard the news? Muhlen's bolted."</p>

<p>"I thought he would."</p>

<p>"They say he owes a good deal."</p>

<p>"Obviously. Else he wouldn't have bolted. Good riddance,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"That's what I say. But he owes me a lot of whiskies, the
blighter."</p>

<p>"You're lucky. Gone off with thirty francs of mine."</p>

<p>"Damn his eyes. I expect we're not the only ones."</p>

<p>"Not by a long chalk. Come and have a drink."</p>

<p>"Heard the news? Muhlen's murdered."</p>

<p>"Serve him bloody well right. The blackguard owes me two francs
fifty. I'll bet it was some money business."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. A little girl, you know. Got a knife in the
stomach. About eleven at night, from all accounts. They heard him
squealing a mile off."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. He was not that kind."</p>

<p>"Not that kind? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Not that kind."</p>

<p>"Not <i>that</i> kind? Really? Go on. You don't say so, by Jove!
What makes you think it?"</p>

<p>"Think? I don't think. I happen to know. You pay for my peg and
I'll tell you all about it..."</p>

<p>"Heard the news? Don Giustino's coming over."</p>

<p>"The old assassin. What of it?"</p>

<p>"Good business! One in the eye for Mali&mdash;what's his name.
There'll be the hell of a row. We ought to be grateful to Muhlen
for this amusement."</p>

<p>"Damned if we ought. Unless he got himself killed on purpose to
amuse us. And even then it would have amused me more if he had paid
me back those seventeen francs."</p>

<p>"You're very hard to please to-day."</p>

<p>"So would you be, if you'd been as raddled as I was last night.
You ought to see the inside of my head, you ought. There's room for
a coal barge, in there."</p>

<p>"That's easily remedied. Toss up for drinks."</p>

<p>"Don't mind if I do..."</p>

<p>Signor Malipizzo heard the news as he was sitting down to
luncheon. At first he thought the priest had gone crazy. Don
Giustino&mdash;good God! Five thousand francs. Where had he found
the money? Then he remembered hearing about old Koppen's cheque for
the organ. Those confounded foreigners, always mixing themselves up
in local concerns! If the <i>parroco</i> were really poor, as these
hypocrites of Christians professed to be, he could never have run
to it. Don Giustino. What an awful turn of events. And all because
Muhlen got himself murdered. These confounded foreigners!</p>

<p>His heart sank within him. He had looked forward to keeping the
priest's cousin for a year or two in gaol, previous to his trial.
That would have to be altered. If Don Giustino came, the
proceedings must be fixed for next morning&mdash;it was the merest
act of courtesy towards a man of his standing, a man whom one must
conciliate at any cost. He blamed himself for arresting that young
idiot. It threatened to bring him into undesired prominence.
Hitherto, by reason of his sheer insignificance, he had escaped the
great Catholic deputy's eye. As Magistrate of Nepenthe, who cared
what political or religious views he professed or in what manner he
administered the law? All this was now changed. He was in the
limelight. It might end&mdash;who knows where? He had other enemies
on the island beside the clericals; the arrival of Don Giustino
might lead to a general revision of his judicial labours. To-morrow
perhaps he would have to confront the monster. Don Giustino! He
knew him by reputation. A Camorrista of the blackest dye. He took
no chances. He never threatened; he performed. Everybody knew that.
Signor Malipizzo did not like the prospect of losing his lucrative
job. Still less did he fancy the notion of receiving a charge of
buck-shot in his liver, one evening from behind a wall. That was
Don Giustino's cheerful way with people who annoyed him. Those
infernal clericals; their sanguinary, out-of-date methods! Papacy
and Camorra&mdash;interconvertible terms&mdash;who could plumb
their depths? The Masons were different. They fought for the
enlightenment of a people deluded by priestly snares and
intimidated by the threats of assassins. Don Giustino. Holy Mother
of God! What would to-morrow bring?</p>

<p>Thinking thus, the judge eyed his victuals resentfully. His
appetite was gone&mdash;he was beginning to feel sick. Suddenly he
pushed his plate away from him and hobbled out of the room, even
forgetting to finish his wine. He limped across the broiling
market-place to give the necessary orders to his faithful and
experienced clerk who, having likewise got wind of that telegram,
was not unprepared for some change of mind on the part of his
chief.</p>

<p>"The young idiot must come up for trial to-morrow, if the
assassin arrives."</p>

<p>"A sound suggestion," the grey-haired one replied. "It will take
the wind out of his sails. It will prove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course it will. And now, Don Carlo, go and take your little
nap. I will stay here, to put my papers in order. May your dreams
be happy."</p>

<p>The judge was dowered with extreme irascibility of temper, due
to his chronic valetudinarian condition. He, too&mdash;within the
limits of propriety&mdash;was not going to take things lying down.
So much was certain. At first he was too agitated to be able to
collect his thoughts. Gradually, as he moved about those rooms,
calmness and confidence returned. He was alone. It was very warm
and quiet here, amid these scenes of his many little triumphs. The
look of the archives, the familiar smell of the place, was
reassuring. He began to feel at ease once more. Ideas came to
him.</p>

<p>He signed warrants for the arrest of the Messiah, Krasnojabkin
and some fifteen others of those who had escaped his wrath on the
previous occasion. They would be under lock and key within two
hours. Don Giustino would never interfere on behalf of these
aliens. Nor would any one else. An inspiration! It would proclaim
his zeal for the public order&mdash;his official independence of
mind.</p>

<p>And&mdash;yes. There was one other little thing.</p>

<p>He hobbled to where the various <i>pieces justificatives</i>
were lying in their sealed envelopes. He took up the receptacle
containing the gold talisman which had been sequestrated from the
priest's nephew, and broke it open. It could always be sealed up
again. The coin, attached to its string, fell out; it was an
old-fashioned medal&mdash;Spanish, apparently. He fingered it
awhile. Then, opening the packet which held Muhlen's gold, he
carefully examined the contents. Five or six of these coins were of
the same kind. French Napoleons. That was lucky. Any stick was good
enough to beat a dog with. This was a particularly good stick. He
bored a hole through one of the Napoleons and placed it on the
culprit's string, after removing the original talisman, which he
bestowed in his own pocket. That done, he sealed up the two parcels
again, conscientiously.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "He laughs best who laughs last. Don Giustino
is a clever man. But the devil himself could not prove the prisoner
innocent, in the face of evidence like this. Down with the
Pope!"</p>

<p>Never had he felt so enlightened, so gloriously
freemasonish.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c44.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>The commendatore Giustino Morena&mdash;familiarly known as Don
Giustino or, by his enemies, as "the assassin"&mdash;was a
Southerner by birth, a city product. From low surroundings he had
risen to be a prominent member of the Chamber of Deputies and one
of the most impressive figures in the country.</p>

<p>As a child he was apprenticed to a cobbler. There, bending over
his work on the pavement outside the shop-door, his blue eyes and
curly fair hair, his rosy cheeks, his winning smile, his precocious
retorts, attracted the most favourable comment from the passers-by
and secured him an unfailing supply of chocolates and cigarettes.
People liked him so much that he quickly learned not only how to
mend shoes but a good many other things which they were anxious to
teach him. His grown-up friends vied with one another for a place
in his affections and a certain scandalous affair with knives,
which somehow or other got into the daily press where it had no
business to be, put the seal on his reputation in the quarter.</p>

<p>"That boy will go far!" the old men and women used to say. "Only
look at his blue eyes. Blessed the mother that bore him, whoever
she was"&mdash;for nobody even pretended to know.</p>

<p>They were right; as old folks are apt to be. The victor in the
disreputable affray happened to be a gentleman of middle age, a
distinguished ornament of the Black Hand. No happier fate could
have been devised for Giustino than to live under the patronage of
such an individual. He took charge of the little fellow, and was
not slow in discovering that his protege possessed not only a
muscular framework and ready wit, but the malice, the concentrated
ruthlessness and rapacity of fifty devils rolled into one.
Something could be made out of that boy, he concluded; the Society,
always ready to adopt promising neophytes on the recommendation of
a qualified practitioner like himself, would doubtless enrol him in
due course. Meanwhile he instructed him, by precept and example,
how to be religious in the manner most pleasing to the Madonna. He
narrated the Lives of the Saints, forced him to attend Mass and
confess himself to one of the Society's trusted priests and taught
him, above all things, to hate the Government because it oppressed
the Pope and the poor. One day he said:</p>

<p>"You must now attend evening classes. I think you will do well
at our school of the Holy Cross. Your outfit is exceptional. Among
other things you have the great advantage that the first and second
fingers of both your hands are of equal length. That augurs well!
God has favoured you, for many lads have to lengthen the first one
artificially, which is apt to weaken the joints."</p>

<p>The Master and Director drew good salaries from the numerous
pupils at this institution. Everything useful to young boys was
taught here save only religion. Seeing that all the scholars were
drawn from families distinguished for their piety and adherence to
the Pope, the Director considered a religious training to be
superfluous&mdash;his pupils learnt these things on their mothers'
knees. Giustino soon acquired the jargon; he passed his examination
in fifteen articles, in secrecy, swiftness of foot and nimbleness
of hand. The latter was taught on a clothed wooden figure out of
whose pockets the students were obliged to extract handkerchiefs,
gold watches and jewelry with such dexterity that not one of the
little bells, which dangled from its hat, gave forth the slightest
sound; that stage passed, the art was practised on the person of
the Director himself who, walking through the streets as an
ordinary citizen, was supposed to have his pockets picked in the
approved professional manner. Those who failed to come up to the
standard were thrashed savagely three or four times; if they still
failed, they were sent back to their parents with a polite
recommendation that they should be taught some other trade.
Giustino was seldom punished. On the contrary, the Director was so
enamoured of his progress and blue eyes that he entered him as a
fox long before the regular three years' course was up, and offered
to tattoo the symbol of proficiency, a cross, on the back of his
right hand.</p>

<p>The patron, while proud of his young friend, did not intend to
spoil his chances in after life by an indelible bodily mark of this
kind however honourably attained. He had other designs for him. To
pass the next year or two, he made arrangements for Giustino, now
grown lean and wolfish, to be officially received into the Black
Hand. As probationer he was the delight of his superiors; he went
through the various tests with phenomenal rapidity and gave
abundant proofs of manliness. At the age of sixteen he had already
killed three men&mdash;one of them being a policeman who was
suspected of infidelity towards the Society. It was then that the
protector, who was no fool, spoke to him a second time, saying:</p>

<p>"As you know, my son, I can neither read nor write. Those were
not considered respectable accomplishments, in my day, for a lad of
spirit or a man of honour. Devil's work! But we live in an
effeminate age. Virtue is at a discount. The wise man, while
observing these things with regret, adapts himself to them. He
marches with the times. They call us reactionaries. It depends upon
boys like you to show the world what reactionaries are good for.
The whole town has already learnt to respect your manly instincts.
You must now go further and learn to read and write. You will then
enter the University. There you will study law and politics. You
will then enter Parliament. There you will represent our cause. The
means&mdash;the money? Trust the Society! Only be a credit to your
friends, defend the poor, and never forget to say your prayers.
Then the good God will reward your efforts."</p>

<p>This is precisely what the good God did. Within a short space of
time the young deputy had made a name for himself; he was
recognized as one of the few representatives of the Black Hand
whose word could be implicitly relied upon. He had a share in
everything; commissions and percentages poured in upon him. After
making an example of half a dozen tiresome persons by having them
quietly stabbed or shot&mdash;nothing was ever proved against him
though everybody knew it was his work&mdash;he experienced no
further opposition in his political career. Morena never threatens,
they say; he performs. A safe man! From a timorous Liberal
Government, his avowed enemies, he extorted the title of
Commendatore; not because he attached any value to such outward
distinctions but because, like a true Camorrista, he never lost an
opportunity of showing that he could do what he pleased with
everybody, Government included. It was an open secret that the next
vacant portfolio of Justice would be at his disposal. All this of
course was years and years ago.</p>

<p>To these arts of statecraft he added a quite unusual legal
acumen and forensic ability. For the last fifteen years he had been
in receipt of large annual retaining fees from the principal
commercial firms of the country; that of one shipping company alone
amounted to fifty thousand francs. They found it worth their while
since, without doing a stroke of work for them, he gave his tacit
support to their most nefarious undertakings. A useful man! As a
lawyer in private cases his reputation was tremendous. Judges and
juries had been known to faint with emotion at his dramatic
gestures, his fiery eloquence. He could pull anybody out of a
scrape. Wherever he spoke the Court was crowded to listen to his
impassioned arguments, to look upon the cold fire of his blue eyes,
his carefully adjusted dress, his fair hair turning to grey, his
smooth face which he kept shaven for no other reason&mdash;so he
used to declare&mdash;than because he reverenced the fashions of
the old papal regime. "Just like an Englishman," people said.</p>

<p>He had lately put on flesh; it inspired confidence. Moreover, he
never married; that also was something out of the common&mdash;it
pointed to independence, to lack of ordinary human frailties. In
short, he was so perfect a compound of vice and intelligence that
even his dearest friends could not put their finger on the exact
spot where the one began and the other ended. And the whole of this
unique mixture was placed at the disposal of the Vatican. Don
Giustino was the implacable enemy of modernism, a living disproof
of the vulgar assertion that freemasonry is the sole key to success
in modern Italy. A formidable man! And growing more formidable
every day, as his wealth increased. His income was already such
that he could afford to be honest; nothing but the force of old
habits kept him from developing into a positive saint.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that a person of this caliber would have
sniffed at a paltry remuneration of five thousand francs offered by
an obscure country priest. But Don Giustino was a good son of the
Church. He had never forgotten the recommendation of his old patron
to succour the humble and distressed; he specialized, as a lawyer,
in defending murderers and rescuing them from the secular arm. They
were enthusiasts suffering under a sense of wrong; they belonged to
the class of the honest poor; they were victims of governmental
greed and social injustice. Motives, not deeds! he would say. And
the motives of the poor must be judged by other standards than
those of the rich. They have other lives, other temptations. Trust
the people. The people, under proper guidance of the priests...</p>

<p>Although it was hardly likely that the great man would deign to
accept Torquemada's invitation, yet half the town was assembled at
the harbour to await the arrival of the evening boat and catch a
glimpse, if possible, of the famous Camorrista. And there he was!
He leaned over the taffrail, easily recognizable from his pictures
in the illustrated papers. He was dressed in a felt hat, brown
boots, and light grey clothes&mdash;just like anybody else.
Presently he descended to the quay, followed by a tall and
solid-looking young valet. He was wreathed in smiles. A whiff of
political life, of busy deeds in the capital, exhaled from his
person. The Mayor of Nepenthe, a devout Catholic, deferentially
shook hands and introduced the <i>parroco</i> and other
notabilities. They drove up together. It was all delightfully
breezy and informal. But men were aware that in this little episode
there lurked more than met the eye; that the arrival of
Commendatore Morena was an occasion worthy to be chronicled in the
annals of the island. Not only was it his first appearance as a
deputy among his constituents. That alone would have been an event.
The avowed purpose of his visit, to rescue a criminal from the
properly constituted authorities, gave it the character of a
pro-Vatican demonstration&mdash;a slap in the face of King and
Constitution.</p>

<p>An intimate little dinner had been arranged by the parish priest
in order to give the principal clergy and a few favoured laymen of
their party an opportunity of paying their respects. No one knew
what took place at this repast save that the distinguished guest
was in wonderful humour; he joked and laughed and told funny
stories; he was enchanted with the wine and the excellent local
crayfish and announced his intention of buying a little villa
wherein to spend the evening of his days, after his public labours
were over. An ideal spot! Lucky people, he called them. It was most
unfortunate that he would be obliged to leave by to-morrow's midday
boat, and so miss the greater part of the festival of Saint
Eulalia.</p>

<p>Another little item of news was allowed to filter out and
sedulously propagated, to the effect that the Commendatore had
refused, politely but firmly, to accept any remuneration for his
services. Such a thing could not be thought of! Pleasure and duty
rarely coincided as in this case, where it was both a pleasure to
come to this charming island and a duty to say a few words in Court
about this unfortunate young man&mdash;to defend the oppressed to
the utmost of his miserable ability, and thereby approve himself a
good son of the Church.</p>

<p>"Your servant in everything!" he added. "And if you would now
accept from me a humble donation of one thousand francs to be
distributed, as His Reverence thinks best, among the needy poor of
Nepenthe, you would indeed make me your debtor for life!"</p>

<p>Such was the great man's speech, as reported. It was a pure
invention on the part of Torquemada who, being a high-principled
ecclesiastic, had clear-cut orthodox views anent the utility of
pious legends. He knew it would sound well among the populace. He
hoped it would vex the envious magistrate into a fit of colic. He
argued that the great man himself, in the event of its coming to
his ears, would not be otherwise than gratified by a godly fable so
strictly in keeping with his character.</p>

<p>Don Francesco alone, the smiling terrestrial beast, the lover of
wine and women, held aloof from the entertainment, alleging a
gastric indisposition and doctor's orders. He did not see eye to
eye with Torquemada on matters such as these. Don Francesco
disliked all measures of violence, Camorra or freemasonry, Vatican
or Quirinal&mdash;disliked them so much that he would have hated
them had he been built, like the <i>parroco</i>, on hating lines.
He was too unwieldy, too fond of life, too indulgent towards
himself and others to experience at mention of Don Giustino's name
anything but a certain feeling of discomfort&mdash;a feeling which
his acute intelligence, embedded under those rolls of fat, enabled
him to formulate with warmth and precision.</p>

<p>"I know quite well," he said to Torquemada, "that he calls
himself a good son of the Church. So much the worse for the Church.
I understand he is a prominent member of the Government. So much
the worse for the Government. And I realize that, but for his
intervention, this harmless individual might spend the remainder of
his life in prison. So much the worse for all of us, who derive
justice from so tainted a source. As to dining at the same table
with him&mdash;no. Does not the whole world know his history? The
animal! He would make me vomit. And you will believe me when I say,
my dear <i>parroco</i>, that I do not look my best on such
occasions."</p>

<p>Torquemada shook his head, mournfully. It was by no means the
first time that he had suspected his popular colleague of being a
lukewarm Christian.</p>

</p>

<p>The market-place was filled to over-brimming. Everybody
discussed the near events in the Court of Justice. It promised to
be a bad day for Signor Malipizzo. And yet people could not help
admitting how clever he had been to lock up those Russians. It was
the best thing he could have done under the circumstances. It
proved his freedom from anti-Catholic prejudices. It made him look
icily objective.</p>

<p>Torquemada, on hearing that the prisoner's gold coin
corresponded with those others which had been in the possession of
the murdered man, thought it deplorable. Here was plain evidence of
his cousin's guilt! Most deplorable. Still, the victim being not
only a foreigner but a Protestant was a considerable mitigation of
the offence from the moral and religious point of view, and
possibly from the legal one as well. Anyhow, what did legal aspects
matter? Had he not engaged Don Giustino? Innocent or guilty, the
prisoner would be released. And, on second thoughts, he discovered
him to be worthy of the great man's golden eloquence. He was not
altogether a fool. There was a touch of manliness about him; he was
decidedly a brighter lad than he looked. He deserved to be
released.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock sounded.</p>

<p>The Court had never been so crowded. There was barely standing
room. Sunlight poured in through the windows which had not been
cleaned for many long months; the atmosphere was already rather
oppressive. It was a stuffy place at all times, reeking of old
tobacco smoke and humanity.</p>

<p>Everybody was still save the old grey-headed clerk who fussed
about with papers. Signor Malipizzo, after a deferential but
dignified bow to the famous lawyer, had taken his seat on the
raised platform facing the public whence he was wont to dispense
justice. Nailed against the wall, directly over his head, was a
large white paper bearing the printed words "La Legge": the law. It
dominated the chamber. On one side of this could be seen a coloured
portrait of the Sovereign in the bersagliere uniform; a fierce
military glance shot out of his eyes from under that helmet whose
plume of nodding feathers made it look three sizes too large for
his head. On the other side hung a representation of the Madonna,
simpering benignly in a blue tea-gown besprinkled with pearls and
golden lace. The spittoon, which His Worship required continually
during the audiences, was wont to be placed immediately below this
latter picture; it was the magistrate's polite freemasonish method
of expressing his reverence for the Mother of God. Everybody
noticed that on the present occasion this piece of furniture was
located elsewhere. It stood below the Sovereign's portrait. A
delicate compliment to the formidable lawyer-champion of
Catholicism, sworn enemy to the House of Savoy. People commented
favourably on this little detail. How artful of him! they said.</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed upon Don Giustino. He sat there quietly. If
he was bored he certainly did not show it. Now that he was here he
would give these good people a taste of his quality. He knew all
about the gold coin; he was profoundly convinced of the prisoner's
guilt. This was lucky for the young man. Had he thought otherwise
he would probably have refused to take up the case. Don Giustino
made a point of never defending innocent people. They were idiots
who entangled themselves in the meshes of the law; they fully
deserved their fate. Really to have murdered Muhlen was the one and
only point in the prisoner's favour. It made him worthy of his
rhetorical efforts. All his clients were guilty, and all of them
got off scot free. "I never defend people I can't respect," he used
to say.</p>

<p>He began his speech in a rambling, desultory sort of fashion and
quite a low tone of voice, as if he were addressing a circle of
friends.</p>

<p>A charming place, Nepenthe! He would carry away the pleasantest
memories of its beauty and the kindliness of its inhabitants. It
was like a terrestrial paradise, so verdant, so remote from all
danger. And yet nothing on earth was secure. That volcanic eruption
the other day&mdash;what a scare it must have given them! What a
lucky escape they had, thanks to the Divine intervention of the
Patron Saint! Hardly any damage done; no victims worth mentioning.
The fertile fields were intact; mothers and fathers and children
could once more go out to their daily tasks and return in the
evening, tired but happy, to gather round the family board. Family
life, the sacred hearth! It was the pride, the strength, the
mainstay of the country; it was the source whence the rising
generation drew their earliest notions of piety and right conduct.
Nothing in the world could replace home influence, the parents'
teaching and example&mdash;nothing! And this poor boy, now
threatened with imprisonment, had a mother. He had a mother. Did
the Court appreciate the import of those words? Did they realize
what it meant to shatter that hallowed bond, to deprive the parent
of her offspring's help and consolation&mdash;the child of its
mother's fostering care? Let them consider the lives of all t hose
great men of the past who were known to have had
mothers&mdash;Themistocles, Dante, Virgil, Peter the Hermit and
Madame de Maintenon&mdash;why had they achieved distinction in the
world? What was the secret of their greatness? A mother's
affectionate guidance in youth. They had not been torn, as
children, from her loving arms.</p>

<p>A good many people were already sobbing. But the orator had
noticed that something was wrong. He consulted a small scrap of
paper and then continued in the same conversational tones as
before.</p>

<p>He had no mother. He was an orphan. An orphan! Did the Court
realize what it meant? No, he dared not ask them to picture to
themselves all that was implied in that bitter word. An orphan.
Nobody to instil those early lessons of piety...to grow up wild,
neglected, despised... It was impossible for a man to avoid going
astray in such terribly unnatural conditions. Everybody else had
parents to counsel and direct them; he alone was bereft of this
blessing. It was cruel, it was illogical, to apply the same
standard to him as to those fortunate other ones. Let the Court
call to mind the names of those who had deviated from the narrow
path of duty; did they not all belong to this unhappy class? It
might safely be inferred that they had no mothers! Such person were
to be pitied and helped, rather than condemned for what was the
fault not of their natures but of their anomalous situation in
life. To rescue a motherless young soul from the brink of perdition
was the noblest task of a Christian. And this was still, thank
Heaven, a Christian country, despite the ever-swelling invasion of
that irreligious foreign element which threatened to break up the
old faith in God. The Madonna was still worshipped; together with
the Saints. Their precious relics and other holy amulets still
proved their efficacy in the hour of danger.</p>

<p>Amulets&mdash;ah, that reminded him.</p>

<p>To kill a man with a view to possessing yourself of his
substance was an unpardonable crime. Now what had this boy done?
Let them take the so-called robbery first. Well, no robbery had
been committed, in spite of the notorious fact that this
Protestant, this foreigner was known to be loaded with money. His
client had fought down the temptation, the almost irresistible
temptation, of appropriating the gold. Let them remember that! The
minutest investigation failed to reveal anything save a single coin
which he had attached to a string and hung about his neck. Motives,
not deeds! What were his motives for this strange act? An
unconscious application of the homoeopathic principle. He had taken
it as a safeguard, an amulet, in the childish belief that it might
protect him on future occasions against insults such as those he
had undergone.</p>

<p>Then, while the audience were still puzzling what the last words
meant, he suddenly indulged in one of those abrupt transitions for
which he was famous, and burst out:</p>

<p>"Down with foreigners! We Catholics know what foreigners are,
how they work for evil in places high and low. One cannot take up a
daily paper without seeing some exposure of their many-sided
viciousness. They contaminate the land with their godless
depravity. Nobody can count on immunity. The highest officials in
the land, the very Ministers of the Crown, are subjected to their
vile disguised attempts at bribery and corruption, no humble
peasant girl, no child, is safe from the befoulment of their filthy
minds. We know them&mdash;our police records, the archives of our
Courts of Justice, testify to their demoralizing agency. A pest, a
contagion! Who can tell what proposals were made in this particular
case&mdash;what degrading proposals, backed by the insidious offer
of foreign gold? A weak character might have succumbed. But the
victim was made of different stuff. He belonged to another
type&mdash;the heroic type. Suffering anguish of soul, he yet
preferred honour to baseness. In self-defence&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point the great Deputy ceased to speak. Signor Malipizzo
had swooned away. He had to be carried out of Court.</p>

<p>It mattered little, for the proceedings were at an end save for
a few formalities. The case was won.</p>

<p>People were rather annoyed at being deprived of one of Don
Giustino's far-famed perorations. It could not be helped. Better
luck next time. Then they asked themselves why the judge had
fainted. Some thought it might be the heat, or a touch of his old
complaint. The majority were agreed that the attack was due to the
Deputy's eloquence. And it was true that he was greatly impressed
by the speech, but not quite as much as all that. He had decided to
faint at a critical moment, for the sake of appearances. It was
clever of him. He did it beautifully too; he had been rehearsing
half the night. Don Giustino, on his part, shared the common
opinion and was charmed with this tribute to his genius.
Altogether, the local judge had made a favourable impression on
him; his attitude had been irreproachably correct. He was not a bat
fellow, for a freemason. One might do worse than leave him in
possession of his present appointment on Nepenthe.</p>

<p>The Deputy freed his prisoner; it was unavoidable. But the
Russians remained in gaol, and this was always something to the
credit of Signor Malipizzo...</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c46.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>Madame Steynlin, on hearing of Peter the Great's arrest, was
stricken dumb. She wept the bitterest tears of all her life. Then,
with returning calmness, she remembered Mr. Keith whose friendship
with the magistrate was the common talk of the place. Would he be
able to do anything? Impulsive by nature, she called on that
gentleman and poured out her griefs to him. Mr. Keith was
sympathetic. He declared he understood perfectly. He promised to do
his utmost, that very day.</p>

<p class="caption">The Little White Cows</p>

<p>The Master, meanwhile, languished in prison. He had nobody to
take his part, not even among the Little White Cows; the new
section, that clique of young extremists, were only too delighted
to have him out of the way. The communal doctor alone interceded on
his behalf, imploring the judge in the name of the sacred
brotherhood of freemasons that he, the Messiah, should be
excarcerated in order that he, the physician, might be enabled to
continue the daily treatment to which the old man had grown
accustomed and for which he was being regularly remunerated. "Think
of my wife and children!" he said to the magistrate.</p>

<p>Signor Malipizzo on this occasion did not mean to be baulked of
his prey. He was in bad humour; Don Giustino had got on his nerves.
By means of a lightning-like discharge of symbols intelligible only
to the Elect he retorted that a physician, who depended for his
livelihood upon a legitimate practice among <i>bona fide</i>
patients, was not fit to be a freemason.</p>

<p>Then the doctor urged the humanitarian aspects of the case. The
old man needed the treatment which could be given in prison just as
well; the fees would doubtless be paid sooner or later.</p>

<p>The magistrate proved inexorable, adamantine. What was good
enough for a native, he argued, was good enough for a vicious old
alien. A stomach-pump in prison! What more? They would be wanting
fried fish and asparagus next.</p>

<p>As a special concession to the Master's age and rank a separate
upper chamber, described as very airy, had been allotted to him in
the local gaol. The poor old man did not know how he got there;
they had thrust him into this strange place and locked the door on
him. Long hours had passed. He sat on an uncomfortable
cane-bottomed chair, his hands folded across his stomach. There was
already a slight sense of oppression in that region of his body.
His head, too, felt heavy. Without knowing how or why, he had
fallen into a trap, after the manner of some dumb beast of earth.
When would they take him out again? And when would that kind
gentleman with the machine arrive?</p>

<p>Daylight entered through a small but thickly grated window.
Looking out from where he sat, he could detect neither men nor
houses nor trees&mdash;nothing but four rectangular patches of deep
blue. The sea! Often had he wondered about the sea, and why it was
there. It had ever been an enigma to him, this purposeless mass of
water. Not even good to drink. He knew nothing of those fables of
the pagans&mdash;of old Poseidon and white-armed Leucothea and the
blithe crew of Triton and silver-footed Thetis moving upon the
placid sunlit waters; nothing of that fair sea-born goddess whose
beauty swayed the hearts of men. His Venus ideals had been of a
more terrestrial nature&mdash;the wives or daughters of army
generals and state functionaries who desired advancement, and
sometimes got it.</p>

<p>Not even good to drink! There was nothing like this in Holy
Russia. God would never have allowed it. The uselessness of this
sea had always been to him a source of perplexity and even vague
apprehension. The spectacle of this shining immensity troubled his
world-scheme. Why did God create water, when land would have been
so much more useful? Often had he puzzled on the subject...Why?</p>

<p>But now, in the evening of his life and the extremity of his
anguish, the truth was made manifest. A Revelation drew nigh. It
just came to him.</p>

<p>The fishes.</p>

<p>It was a dying gleam of intelligence, his last inspired thought,
his swan-song. How else could the fishes live save in the water?
All these long years he had remained ignorant of the truth. Ah, if
only his disciples were at hand, to jot it down into that <i>Golden
Book</i>!</p>

<p>But why&mdash;why must the fishes live in water? And why so much
water for so few fishes? Why cannot fishes live on land? Then
everybody would be satisfied. Inscrutable are the ways of
God...</p>

<p>And his glazed eye moved wearily from that disquieting expanse
of blue along the wall of his chamber which had once been white and
was now scrawled over with obscene jests and drawings, product of
the leisure hours of generations of prisoners. The writing, like
all writing, was unintelligible to him. But some of the artistic
efforts left little to the imagination. He was saddened, less by
homely pictures than by the unfamiliar script. He had always
distrusted the written word. Why all these strange
letterings&mdash;so unnecessary, so dangerous to the life of an
orthodox Christian? What one brother has to tell another&mdash;why
write it down?</p>

<p>He saw the straw pallet destined for his nocturnal repose. It
reminded him dimly of a similar resting-place during his monastic
life. Then, too, he had slept on a couch near the floor. Flickering
visions came to him of those days, so long ago, ere yet the First
Revelation was given to the world. A breath of old Russia was
wafted into his nostrils. He remembered the lusty, jovial country
folk, the songs and dances at hay-making, the fragrance of the
land, the sluggish rivers rolling their brown mud about the plains,
the mild long-drawn evenings. He felt again that all-pervading
charm of sadness, of tender yearning, that hangs in the pale
Russian sky and penetrates to the very soul of the endless
country.</p>

<p>Gloomy autumn days&mdash;wet leaves and lowering horizons. The
long winter within doors. Faces appeared to him, faces of old, an
endless procession of faces clear-cut as ever...his brother monks,
bearded and unkempt...debauched acolytes...pilgrims from the Holy
Land ...glittering festal robes...vodka orgies, endless chants and
litanies, holy lamps burning, somber eikons with staring eyes...the
smell of greasy lukewarm cabbage soup, of unwashed bodies and boot
leather and incense. Holy Russia&mdash;it all moved before his eyes
in a kind of melodious twilight. Then the First Revelation. The
Man-God.</p>

<p>Man-God. The word filtered through his intelligence. How strange
it sounded. The Man-God&mdash;what could it mean.</p>

<p>A sudden change. A life of glory and intrigue. Food on platters
of gold, sparkling wines and laughter. A diamond cross, an imperial
gift, the reward of faithful services. Everybody cringing. Showers
of bribes. Women&mdash;always women. A divine life! Nothing but
women...</p>

<p>Darkness. Something had happened; they had carried him into a
place full of endless penances, floggings, starvings. Then they
accused him of doing wrong. What was it? The flesh of warm-blooded
beasts...He had preferred the service of God to that of his earthly
master. For this they banished him and made him suffer. He was
dying now&mdash;dying to save mankind. He was giving up his life
for sinners. Someone else had once done the same thing. Who was it?
He could not remember. People who read and write&mdash;they know
these things. Some saint, possibly; or at least a man from another
province&mdash;someone he had never met or spoken to. A good
Russian, whoever it was. But the name&mdash;the name had slipped
out of his mind. He always had a good memory for faces, but a bad
one for names.</p>

<p>He was so ill and oppressed too. Worse than before. He felt
himself rotting earthwards, like a fungus of his own native forests
under autumn rains. His body remained inert but his eye, roaming
away from the straw pallet, fixed itself upon the door. When, when
would that kindly gentleman with the instrument arrive?</p>

</p>

<p>Concerning the life and death of Saint Eulalia, patroness of
Nepenthean sailors, we possess ample and accurate information.</p>

<p>She was born in 1712 at a remote village in the Spanish province
of Estramadura. Various divine portents accompanied her birth. Her
mother dreamed a strange dream about a sea-serpent; her father was
cured of a painful gouty affection; the image of Saint James of
Compostella in the local church was observed to smile benignly at
the very hour of her entry into the world. At the age of two years
and eleven months she took the vow of chastity. Much difficulty was
experienced in keeping the infant alive; she tormented her body in
so merciless a fashion. She refused to partake of food save once in
every five weeks; she remained immovable "like a statue" for months
on end; she wore under her rough clothing iron spikes which were
found, after death, to have entered deeply into her flesh. She was
never known to use a drop of water for purposes of ablution or to
change her underwear more than once a year, and then only at the
order of her confessor who was obliged to be in daily contact with
her. The heat of her body was such that it could not be touched by
human hands. During her frequent trances she spoke accurately in
sixty-nine different languages; there was no hair whatever on her
head which was "spotless as an egg." She put baskets of sea urchins
into her bed and, as a penance for what she called "her many sins,"
forced herself to catch the legions of vermin that infested her
brown blanket, count them, separate the males from the females, set
them free once more, and begin over again. She died at the age of
fourteen years and two months. Her corpse forthwith became roseate
in colour, exhaled a delicious odour of violets for twenty weeks,
and performed countless miracles. On dissection, a portrait of
Saint James of Compostella was discovered embedded in her
liver.</p>

<p>Saint Eulalia appeared too late to find her proper niche in
Monsignor Perrelli's <i>Antiquities</i> or to be commemorated in
some worthy architectural monument by the Good Duke Alfred; too
late&mdash;and this is doubtless a lucky circumstance&mdash;to
become the victim of one of Father Capocchio's offensive sneers.
Whoever is interested in her saintly career may purchase at
Nepenthe, for the small sum of sixpence, an admirable biography by
a young Canon of the Church, Don Giacinto Mellino. It gives a full
account of her life and of those nine hundred and seventy-two
miracles of hers which have been authenticated by eye-witnesses. No
need, therefore, to expatiate further.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that Mr. Eames possessed a copy of this
treatise. An ideal annotator, he rarely indulged in speculation;
his business was to discover and co-ordinate references.
Nevertheless, in regard to the earthly life of this particular
saint, he used to say: "There are some things a man cannot help
puzzling about." It irked him&mdash;her success on Nepenthe. He
knew the sailormen to be a horny-handed, skeptical, worldly brood.
Why had they imported the cult of Eulalia from Spain; why had they
chosen for their patroness a mawkish suffering nonentity, so
different from those sunny goddesses of classical days? He
concluded, lamely, that there was an element of the child in every
Southerner; that men, refusing to believe what is improbable,
reserve their credulity for what is utterly impossible; in brief,
that the prosaic sea-folk of Nepenthe were like everybody else in
possessing a grain of stupidity in their composition&mdash;"which
does not bring us much further," he would add...</p>

<p>At the time of this year's festival Mr. Eames was supremely
happy. Another pamphlet had come into his hands, an anonymous
pamphlet making fun of the Duchess whose reception into the Roman
Church had been fixed for the day of Saint Eulalia's festival. It
bore the objectionable title <i>The Dipping of the Duchess</i> and
had presumably been indited by some wag at the Alpha and Omega Club
who disapproved of water in every shape, even for baptismal
purposes. The stuff was printed on the sly and hastily circulated
about the island&mdash;some people maintained that Mr. Richards,
the respectable Vice-President of that institution, was its author.
It was a scurrilous anti-Catholic leaflet, grossly personal and
savouring of atheism. The Duchess, on hearing of
it&mdash;everything got about on Nepenthe&mdash;was so distressed
that she decided to cancel, or at least postpone, the ceremony of
her public conversion. At a meeting of urgency convened by the
priests, who were bitterly disappointed at her attitude, it was
agreed that this was no time for half-measures. A round sum of
money was voted wherewith to buy back the pernicious pamphlet from
its respective owners with a view to its destruction.</p>

<p>In the space of a single day every copy vanished from the
island&mdash;every copy save one, which had found its way into Mr.
Eames' collection. He meant to keep that copy. He would have died
sooner than yield it up. When the clerical deputation arrived at
his villa with soft words and promises of more solid lucre, he
professed the uttermost amazement at their quest. Mr. Eames, the
soul of honesty, the scorner of all subterfuge and crooked dealing,
put on a new character. He lied like a trooper. He lied better than
a trooper; that is to say, not only forcefully but convincingly. He
lied as only a lover of bibliographical curios can lie, in defence
of his treasure. He thanked them for their courteous visit and bade
them keep their gold. He professed himself a poor recluse innocent
of the world's ways and undesirous of riches, adding, as a mere
afterthought, that he had not so much as heard of the noxious
broadsheet in question. There must be some mistake. Society people
might know something about it; that gentleman who called himself a
bishop for example, that sallow gentleman from Africa, who spent so
much of his time in social gaieties&mdash;he might very likely have
received a copy. If they wished, he would gladly make enquiries,
discreet enquiries, about the matter.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Eames' second lapse from grace. Gentlemen do not tell
falsehoods. He did not want to be a gentleman just then. He wanted
that pamphlet.</p>

<p>The reverend visitors withdrew convinced, amid showers of
compliments and apologies. After seeing them safely off the
premises and even, for greater security, half-way down the hill,
Mr. Eames returned, drew out the jewel from where it lay in a
secret hiding-place among others of its kind, and hugged it to his
heart. He purposed to reproduce the pamphlet <i>in extenso</i>, in
that particular appendix to his edition of Perrelli's
<i>Antiquities</i> which dealt with "Contemporary Social History."
...</p>

<p>Mr. Heard knew nothing of all this as, jostled among the crowd,
he watched the procession on that bright morning. It reminded him
of the feast of Saint Dodekanus which he had witnessed twelve days
earlier; it was even more extravagant. But he now felt himself
seasoned to this kind of display. Besides, he had seen funnier
things in Africa; though not much funnier. Once more his thoughts
went back to those laughing black people, he remembered all of
them&mdash;the Wabitembes, the M'tezo, the Kizibubi&mdash;what a
set of jovial ruffians! How they would have enjoyed this sunshiny
nonsense. And the Bulangas. Really, those Bulangas&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a light touch on his shoulder. He turned, and found
himself face to face with Mrs. Meadows. She was smiling and looking
ever so happy.</p>

<p>"Well, Tommy!" she said. "You don't seem to be very pleased to
see me. Why haven't you come to tea lately? And why are you looking
so glum? He's got his leave, after all. I had a cable two days ago.
He'll pick me up here in a fortnight or three weeks. Aren't you
glad you needn't escort me to England?"</p>

<p>"Awfully glad!" he replied, trying to be jocular. The words
stuck in his throat. He had expected to meet&mdash;if he met her at
all&mdash;a skulking contrite criminal. This woman was jubilant. An
amazing, terrifying state of affairs.</p>

<p>"There is something the matter with you, Tommy. Perhaps you have
caught my headache. You remember how inquisitive you were? And how
you complained of the roses? If you come up now you will find fresh
ones waiting for you."</p>

<p>Her glance was unclouded. No human being ever looked less
conscience-stricken. It was as though she had convinced herself of
the righteousness of her deed, and thereafter dismissed it from her
mind as something not worth bothering about. Blithe as a bird! If
he had not seen with his own eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has it gone, your headache?" he enquired, not knowing what to
say.</p>

<p>"Gone away altogether. I have heard so much about this
procession that I thought I would drive down and have a look at it.
I missed the last one, you know. Besides, I wanted to see some
friends here whom I've been neglecting lately. I feel quite guilty
about it," she added.</p>

<p>He couldn't help saying:</p>

<p>"You don't look guilty."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you mustn't judge by appearances!"</p>

<p>"You blamed the sirocco, I remember."</p>

<p>"I don't blame it any longer. Surely a woman can change her
mind? But what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the south wind," he ventured.</p>

<p>She remarked laughingly:</p>

<p>"I don't believe the wind is in the south at all. But you always
were a funny boy, Tommy. If you are very good you will see some
pretty fireworks presently. As for myself, I shall have to drive
home for Baby's early dinner."</p>

<p>"Fireworks in broad daylight?" he asked. "That is something
new."</p>

<p>"In broad daylight! Aren't they queer people? They can't wait
till it gets dark, I suppose."</p>

<p>At that moment they were joined by Keith and three or four
others. He had no more chance of speaking to her alone; she drove
away, not long afterwards, waving her parasol at him and leaving
him in a state of dazed perplexity.</p>

<p>He had been thinking night and day about his cousin, certain of
her criminality and profoundly convinced of her moral rectitude.
What had Muhlen done? He had probably threatened her with some
exposure. He was her legal husband&mdash;he could make himself
abominable to her and to Meadows. The future of the child, too, was
imperiled. He might be able to claim it; or if not that&mdash;the
bishop's notions of bastardy laws were not very clear&mdash;he
could certainly rely upon his friend the magistrate to take the
child out of the mother's custody or do something horrible of that
kind. The happiness of that whole family was at his mercy. She had
been goaded to desperation. Mr. Heard began to understand. To
understand&mdash;that was not enough. Anybody could understand.</p>

<p>Keith took his arm and remarked:</p>

<p>"Come and see my cannas! They are prefect just now. I must tell
you a story about them&mdash;it's the wildest romance. I am the
only person in Europe who understands the proper cultivation of
cannas. I shall have scented ones soon."</p>

<p>"Don't they smell?" enquired the bishop absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"Not yet. You are looking a little tired, Heard, as if you had
not slept well lately. Perhaps you would like to sit down? We can
watch the fireworks from the terrace. You ought to read Pepys'
<i>Diary</i>. That is what I have been doing. I am also rather
low-spirited just now. The end of another spring, you know&mdash;it
always makes me feel sad. Pepys is the antidote. He is a tonic.
Every Englishman ought to be compelled, for the good of his soul,
to go through Pepys once in three years."</p>

<p>"I must read him again," said the bishop who was not
particularly interested in the diarist just then.</p>

<p>"His universal zest! It seems to be extinct nowadays; it is a
charm that I have not discovered in any living Englishman. What a
healthy outlook! Not a trace of straining anywhere. He took life
with both hands. How he threw himself into his work, his
amusements, his clothes and women and politics and food and
theatres and pictures. Warm heart, cool head. So childlike, and yet
so wise. There's only one thing that troubles me about
him&mdash;his love of music. It was so obviously sincere. He not
only liked it; he actually understood it. Music, to me, is a
succession of sounds more or less painful. I can't even whistle.
It's too bad."</p>

<p>The bishop said:</p>

<p>"If the lives of all of us were written down with the same
remorseless candour, how few would stand the test."</p>

<p>He was thinking of the Devil's Rock.</p>

<p>"I don't trouble about tests," replied Keith. "The whole herd of
humanity adapts its pace to that of the weakest lamb. The capacity
of the weakest lamb&mdash;that is the test. I don't consider myself
bound to such a vulgar standard. And how spectacular we are, in
matters of so-called right and wrong. That is because we have
painfully cultivated the social conscience. Posing, and playing to
the gallery! Mankind is curiously melodramatic, my dear fellow;
full of affected reverence for its droll little institutions. As if
anybody really cared what another person does! As if everybody were
not chuckling inwardly all the time!"</p>

<p>"Surely there are heights and depths in the matter of
conduct?"</p>

<p>"I don't trouble about heights and depths. Does it not all
depend upon where we take up our stand? Must we always remain
stationary like vegetables? A bird knows nothing of heights and
depths. You sit here at night-time and look at the stars. They are
firm-fixed, you say. Well, they are not firm-fixed. Therefore it is
the wrong way to look at them. I have also written a diary, Heard.
It is my legacy to posterity and will be published after my death.
It relates of actions not all of which Count Caloveglia would call
pretty. Perhaps it will give some people the courage of their
unspoken convictions."</p>

<p>The bishop suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"If somebody you knew had committed a crime, what would you say?
Somebody you really respect&mdash;a person like Mrs. Meadows?"</p>

<p>"Your cousin? I should say that whatever Mrs. Meadows does is
well done."</p>

<p>"You would approve?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would. People like that are bound to be in the
right."</p>

<p>"Really...?"</p>

<p>The fireworks were splendid; altogether, Saint Eulalia's day
proved a tremendous success. The festal joy was only marred by the
unseemly behaviour of Miss Wilberforce, who profited by the
occasion to let off some fireworks, or at least steam, of her
own.</p>

<p>In broad daylight too.</p>

<p>This was something new, and rather ominous.</p>

<p>The dear lady was becoming quite a problem.</p>

</p>

<p>Men looked down from the market-place that afternoon and beheld
a gaily-coloured throng moving about Madame Steynlin's awkwardly
situated promontory. Her house and its wide terrace overhanging the
sea were filled with guests. The entertainment differed from the
receptions of the Duchess. It was more rustic and
unrestrained&mdash;more in the nature of a picnic. Everything
possible had been done to convert that tongue of land, that
refractory stretch of trachyte, into a garden. Paths were blasted
through the rock; those few scarred olives, the aboriginals, had
been supplanted by whatever flowers and shade-giving trees could be
induced, with assiduous waterings, to strike roots into the arid
soil. It was still rather a transparent place.</p>

<p>A number of new people had lately arrived on Nepenthe in favour
of whom the hostess, with the frank cordiality of her nature, had
issued invitations broadcast. There was the celebrated R. A. and
his dowdy wife; a group of American politicians who were supposed
to be reporting on economic questions and spent the Government's
money in carousing about Europe; Madame Albert, the lady doctor
from Lyons whose unique combination of magic and massage (a family
secret) had brought the expiring Prince of Philippopolis to life
again; an Italian senator with his two pretty daughters; a bluff
hilarious Scotchman, Mr. Jameson, who, as a matter of fact, had
done seven years for forgery but did not like to have it brought up
against him; some sisters of charity; a grizzled sea-captain who
was making discreet enquiries about a safe place for a shipwreck,
having been promised by the owners twenty per cent of his vessel's
insurance money; a dilapidated Viscount and his <i>soi-disant</i>
niece; two fluffy Danish ladies who always travelled together and
smiled at everything, though the younger one smiled in such a
horrible knowing fashion that you could not help disliking her;
Mrs. Roger Rumbold who addressed meetings to advocate Infanticide
for the Masses; Mr. Bernard of the Entomological Society-author of
<i>The Courtship of Cockroaches</i>; another young man of pleasant
exterior who was held to be an architect because his brother used
to be employed in a well-known engineering firm, and several
more.</p>

<p>The exclusive Mr. Eames was absent. He sat at home, thinking how
narrowly he had escaped imprisonment at the hands of Signor
Malipizzo, in connection with Muhlen's disappearance. The closest
shave of all his life! It showed how right Keith had been in
bidding him keep on the right side of the law&mdash;on the right
side of the judge&mdash;rather than trust to the promptings of a
"good conscience." The Duchess likewise sent her excuses. She was
so troubled about the pamphlet that Don Francesco hardly dared to
leave her side. He, therefore, was also absent; so was the bereaved
Commissioner. Mrs. Meadows had driven home again long ago. Van
Koppen intended to sail in the early hours of next morning. The
bishop and Denis were likewise on the verge of departure. A
break-up was at hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith alone refused to budge. He was waiting for the first
cicada whose strident call was due, he declared, in a week's time.
Till then he proposed to remain on Nepenthe.</p>

<p>"Fancy waiting for an insect," said his friend van Koppen. "I
believe, Keith, you've got a sentimental streak somewhere."</p>

<p>"I have been fighting against it all my life. A man ought to
dominate his reflexes. But if the insect keeps good time&mdash;why
not?"</p>

<p>He was in an elegiac mood, though he meant to drive away his
cares later in the evening by the "Falernian system." He felt the
exodus in the air. Another spring drawing to its
close&mdash;everybody scattering! He was filled, too, with that
peculiar pensiveness which troubles complex people when they have
done a kindly act. Virtue had gone out of him.</p>

<p>He had wrought a miracle.</p>

<p>The moist look in the eye of his hostess testified to the
miracle; so did her frock which, being of pink muslin, harmonized
with the state of her mind but not with her complexion. Peter the
Great had escaped from prison. Not only he, but all the others were
at liberty once more, including the Messiah who, after some
attentions on the part of the communal doctor, had been put to bed
like a little child. The rest of them filled her trim walks with
their gleeful laughter and bright raiment; they devoured abundant
wines and food at those refreshment tables which groaned under the
weight of good things. One could trust Madame Steynlin to attend to
the commissariat department. She knew how to gladden the human
heart. That of Peter the Great was gladdened to such an extent that
he soon began to perform a Russian peasant dance, <i>a pas
seul</i>, to the delight of the assembled guests. It was a cheery
interlude with a disastrous ending, for the rough terrace being
different from what he expected, he stumbled and fell full length
upon the ground. There he lay, laughing, like a young giant
refreshed with wine.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you have done it, Mr. Keith," she said, "and I
am not going to ask. But I shall never forget this kindness of
yours."</p>

<p>"Would you not do the same for me? I imagine, between ourselves,
that the judge has been a good deal flustered with this trial and
the intervention of Don Giustino. Perhaps he lost his head. We are
all liable to that, are we not? He is a nervous man; but quite a
good fellow if one keeps on the right side of him. It is so easy to
keep on the right side of people. I often wonder, Madame Steynlin,
why men are so full of bitterness towards each other. It is one of
the things I shall never live to understand. And another is this
problem of music! Will you help me to grasp the pleasure which you
seem to derive from it? Helmholtz does not bring me much further.
He explains why certain sounds are necessarily
disagreeable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Keith! You would go to a professor. I fear you are not
very musical. Have you never felt inclined to cry?"</p>

<p>"I have. But not in a concert-room."</p>

<p>"Nor yet in a theatre?"</p>

<p>"Never," he replied, "though it saddens me a little to see
grown-up men and women stalking about in funny dressing-gowns and
pretending to be kings and queens. When I watch <i>Hamlet</i> or
<i>Othello</i>, I say to myself: 'This stuff is nicely riveted
together. But, in the first place, the story is not true. And
secondly, it is no affair of mine. Why cry about it?'"</p>

<p>"That looks as if you were heartless and unimaginative. And you
so compassionate! I do not understand you. I do not understand
myself either. We are always groping about in the dark, are we not?
We are always puzzling about our own problems instead of helping
other people with theirs. Perhaps one should not think so much of
oneself, though it is an interesting subject. Tell me, if music
says nothing to you, why not leave it alone?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to be able to extract pleasure from it, as you
do. That is what makes me curious. I like to understand things,
because then I can begin to enjoy them. I think knowledge should
intensify our pleasures. That is its aim and object, so far as I am
concerned. What are other joys&mdash;those of the illiterate and
incurious? A dog scratching his fleas in the sunshine. They too are
not wholly to be despised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a dreadful simile!"</p>

<p>"A precise one."</p>

<p>"You like to be precise?"</p>

<p>"It is my mother's fault. She brought me up so carefully."</p>

<p>"I think that is a pity, Mr. Keith. If I had children I would
let them run wild. People are too tame nowadays. That is why so few
of them have any charm. These poor Russians&mdash;no one tries to
understand them. Why is everybody so much alike? Because we never
follow our feelings. And yet, what is a surer guide than the heart?
We seem to live in a world of echoes."</p>

<p>"A world of masks, Madame Steynlin. It is the only theatre worth
looking at..."</p>

<p>The lady was too happy to consider how the miracle had been
wrought, though she suspected dirty work at the bottom of it. She
never discovered how simple had been the method of Mr. Keith who
had merely given His Worship to understand that he had done enough
bribing for one season and that, unless Krasnojabkin were promptly
released, there would be no bribing whatever next year. The judge,
with his usual legal acumen, perceived the cogency of his friend's
argument. He met Mr. Keith's wishes more than half-way. On an
impulse of downright good-nature&mdash;there was no other
interpretation to be put on it&mdash;he released all the Russians,
including the Messiah. They were excarcerated then and there on a
decree of "provisional liberty," which looked well in the records
of the Court and, being interpreted, signified immunity from
further judicial molestation. The incident was closed.</p>

<p>People talked about it none the less. They discussed Don
Giustino, his past career and present prosperity. As for Mr.
Muhlen&mdash;he was already almost forgotten. So was the
Commissioner's lady. Madame Steynlin alone brought herself to say a
few kind words about both of them. She was ready to say kind things
about anyone. The magic of love! Her heart, under the influence of
Peter, had opened so wide as to embrace not only the Russian
colony, but even the nine thousand families of Chinese cultivators
who, according to a paragraph in the morning's newspaper, had
perished in a sudden inundation of the Hoang-Ho.</p>

<p>The poor people! she said. She did not see why one should not
sympathize with the griefs of a Chinaman. Humble honest folks,
without a doubt&mdash;swept off the face of the earth, through no
fault of their own, by a cataclysm! There was quite a discussion
about it on her terrace that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard, feeling also very charitable, found himself taking
her part against someone who said it was impossible to sympathize
with the troubles of a yellow man&mdash;they were too different,
too remote from ourselves. He thought that much individual hardship
had been suffered, undeserved, unchronicled; homes destroyed,
children drowned before the eyes of their parents. And nobody
seemed to care.</p>

<hr>

<p class="cp"><img src="2301181h-images/V2-c49.jpg" alt="Illustration"

</p>

<p>Later on, he turned his back upon the crowded walks and found
himself on a remote terrace overlooking the sea. It was quiet here,
in view of the sunset&mdash;his last sunset on Nepenthe.</p>

<p>Leaning over the parapet he enjoyed, once more, the strangely
intimate companionship of the sea. He glanced down into the water
whose uneven floor was diapered with long weedy patches, fragments
of fallen rock, and brighter patches of sand; he inhaled the
pungent odour of sea-wrack and listened to the breathings of the
waves. They lapped softly against the rounded boulders which
strewed the shore like a flock of nodding Behemoths. He remembered
his visits at daybreak to the beach&mdash;those unspoken
confidences with the sunlit element to whose friendly caresses he
had abandoned his body. How calm it was, too, in this evening
light. Near at hand, somewhere, lay a sounding cave; it sang a
melody of moist content. Shadows lengthened; fishing boats, moving
outward for their night-work, steered darkly across the luminous
river at his feet. Those jewel-like morning tints of blue and green
had faded from the water; the southern cliff-scenery, projections
of it, caught a fiery glare. Bastions of flame...</p>

<p>The air seemed to have become unusually cool and bracing.</p>

<p>Here, on a bench all by himself, sat Count Caloveglia. As the
bishop took a seat beside him they exchanged a few words. The
Italian, so affable as a rule, was rather preoccupied and
disinclined for talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Heard remembered his first encounter with that old
man&mdash;the Salt of the South, as Keith had called him. It was at
those theatricals in the Municipality. Then too the Count had been
remarkably silent, his chin reposing in his hand, absorbed in the
spectacle&mdash;in the passionate grace of the young players. He
was absorbed in another spectacle now&mdash;the old sun, moving in
passionless splendour down the sky.</p>

<p>Only a fortnight ago, that first meeting. Less than a fortnight.
Twelve days. How much had been crammed into them!</p>

<p>A kind of merry nightmare. Things happened. There was something
bright and diabolical in the tone of the place, something
kaleidoscopic&mdash;a frolicsome perversity. Purifying, at the same
time. It swept away the cobwebs. It gave you a measure, a standard,
whereby to compute earthly affairs. Another landmark passed;
another milestone on the road to enlightenment. That period of
doubt was over. His values had righted themselves. He had carved
out new and sound ones; a workable, up-to-date theory of life. He
was in fine trim. His liver&mdash;he forgot that he ever had one.
Nepenthe had done him good all round. And he knew exactly what he
wanted. A return to the Church, for example, was out of the
question. His sympathies had outgrown the ideals of that
establishment; a wave of pantheistic benevolence had drowned its
smug little teachings. The Church of England! What was it still
good for? A stepping-stone, possibly towards something more
respectable and humane; a warning to all concerned of the folly of
idolizing dead men and their delusions. The Church? Ghosts!</p>

<p>His thoughts wandered to England. Often had he sighed, in
Africa, for its drowsy verdant opulence&mdash;those willow-fringed
streamlets and grazing cattle, the smell of hay, the flowery lanes,
the rooks cawing among slumberous elms; often had he thought of
that village on the hill-top with its grey steeple. Well, he would
see them all in a few days. And how would England compare with the
tingling realism of Nepenthe? Rather parochial, rather dun;
grey-in-grey; subdued light above&mdash;crepuscular emotions on
earth. Everything fireproof, seaworthy. Kindly thoughts expressed
in safe unvarying formulas. A guileless people! Ships tossing at
sea; minds firmly anchored to the commonplace. Abundance for the
body; diet for the spirit. The monotony of a nation intent upon
respecting laws and customs. Horror of the tangent, the extreme,
the unconventional. God save the King.</p>

<p>So much the better. This soulful cult of tradition, this
clinging to the obvious and genteel as it were an anchor of
safety&mdash;it nipped in the bud the monster-making faculty of low
horizons and bleak, wintry stretches of earth. Bazhakuloff! Those
Russians, it struck him, had been providentially sent to Nepenthe
for his delectation and instruction. He was glad to have beheld a
type of this nature, inconceivable in England. That grotesque, with
three million followers! It had been a liberal education to look
into his vacuous face, into those filmy eyes dripping with
saintliness and alcohol. The Little White Cows! Chimaeras,
engendered in hyperborean mists.</p>

<p>And still Count Caloveglia said nothing. He gazed at the sun,
whose orb now rolled upon the rim of the horizon. Slowly it sank,
fusing the water into a golden pool. A hush fell upon nature.
Colours fled from earth into the sky. They scattered among the
clouds. The enchantment began, overhead.</p>

<p>At last the old man remarked:</p>

<p>"I suppose that is why I am no colourist. That is why I worship
the inexorable rigour of form. We of the South, Mr. Heard, are
drenched in volatile beauty...And yet one never wearies of these
things! It is what you call a glamour, an interlude of witchcraft.
Nature is a-tremble with the miraculous. She beckons us to explore
her strange places. She says: Tread here, my friend&mdash;and here;
tread where you have never trodden before! The sage surrenders his
intelligence, and grows young again. He recaptures the spirit of
his boyish dreams. He peers into worlds unknown. See! Adventure and
discovery are lurking on every side. These painted clouds with
their floating banners and citadels, yonder mysterious headlands
that creep into the landscape at this hour, those islets emerging,
like flakes of bronze, out of the sunset-glow&mdash;all the wonder
of the <i>Odyssey</i> is there!"</p>

<p>He spoke out of politeness and soon fell silent again. His
thoughts roamed far away.</p>

<p>They were thoughts commensurate with the grandeur of the
scene.</p>

<p>Count Caloveglia was no colourist. He was a sculptor, about to
reap the reward of his labours. The cheque would be in his pocket
that night. Three hundred and fifty thousand francs&mdash;or
nearly. That is what made him not exactly grave, but reserved.
Excess of joy, like all other excesses, is not meet to be displayed
before men. All excess is unseemly. Nothing overmuch. Measure in
everything.</p>

<p>Measure even in the fabrication of Hellenic masterpieces. He had
created one of them (the Demeter did not count); it sufficed for
his modest ambitions. The Faun was his first forgery and his last.
To retrieve the fortunes of his family he had employed those
peculiar talents which God had given him. He would remain,
henceforward, an artist. He shrank from the idea of becoming a
wholesale manufacturer of antiques.</p>

<p>Three hundred and fifty thousand francs. If sufficed. Thinking
of those figures, he began to smile with contentment. He
smiled&mdash;but no more. And as he continued to muse upon the
transaction his look melted, imperceptibly, into one of reverential
awe; there was a solemnity about that sum, an amplitude, a
perfection of outline that reminded him, in a way, of the
proportions of some wonderful old Doric temple. The labour of a
lifetime would not have enabled him to collect so much had he tried
to sell bronzes of his own workmanship. A bust or statue by Count
Caloveglia&mdash;it would command a certain small price, no doubt;
but what was the reputation, the market value, of the most eminent
modern artist as compared with that nameless but consummate
craftsman of Locri?</p>

<p>The Count saw things in their true perspective. His mental
attitude towards Sir Herbert Street and his American employer was
not tinged with the faintest cloud of disrespect; for van Koppen,
indeed, he cherished a liking which bordered on affection. He
detected in the astute American what nobody else could
detect&mdash;an element of childlike freshness and simplicity. As
far apart, in externals, as two distant trees whose leaves are
fluttering on either side of some tangled forest, he yet felt that
their roots were interwoven below ground, drawing common life and
nourishment and sympathies from that old teeming soil of human
aspirations. Nor was he vainglorious of his achievement. His
superiority over the art-expert he took as a gift of the gods.
Vanityi was abhorrent to his nature. He was not proud but
glad&mdash;glad to have been able to reconquer his legitimate
social position; glad, above all things, to have forged a link with
the past&mdash;a key to admit him into the fellowship of Lysippus
and those others whose august shades, he opined, were even them
smiling upon him. The Locri Faun was his handiwork. He was
"entitled to dine well," as he had told Denis. That was what he now
purposed to do. One master-stroke had repaired his fortunes. It
sufficed. Nothing overmuch. Count Caloveglia knew the story of
Polycrates, the too-fortunate man. He knew what lies in wait for
the presumptuous mortal whoo oversteps the boundary of what is fair
and good. Nemesis!</p>

<p>Three hundred and fifty thousand francs. There would be an ample
dowry for Matilda. And, as regards himself, he could return to his
passion of youth; he could afford to become a sculptor again and
even, if so disposed, a collector&mdash;though not exactly after
the style of his excellent friend Cornelius van Koppen.</p>

<p>"That was a suggestive encounter, was it not, between the Deputy
and our local judge?"</p>

<p>He spoke, as before, out of civility.</p>

<p>"Very suggestive," assented Mr. Heard. "Two blackguards, I call
them."</p>

<p>The bishop was particularly glad to learn, as everybody on the
island had learnt, the minutest details of this sordid legal
affair. It seemed likewise to have been providentially arranged, in
order to afford him an insight into the administration of local
law, and some notion of what would have been in store for his
cousin had she applied for relief from Muhlen's persecutions to
Signor Malipizzo, his intimate friend. There would have been no
justice for her&mdash;not from that quarter. He would probably have
forbidden the child to be moved out of his jurisdiction, pending
the progress of a trial which might never end. Nor could the
English Court, with its obsolete provisions on this head, have
regarded Muhlen otherwise than as her legal husband&mdash;the child
of her later union as illegitimate. Bastardy: a taint for life! How
well she had done to put herself beyond a rancorous letter of the
law; to protect her child and family according to the immutable
instincts of mankind!</p>

<p>The Nepenthe magistrate had shown what he was capable of, in his
bestial dealings with a half-witted lad and those harmless Russian
lunatics&mdash;the first one saved through the intervention of a
cut-throat politician, and the second...well, he did not exactly
know how the Muscovites had been able to regain their freedom but,
remembering what Keith had told him about Miss Wilberforce, her
periodical imprisonments and his periodical bribes, he shrewdly
suspected some underhand practices on the part of that gentleman at
the instigation, very possibly, of the charming Madame Steynlin.
Signor Malipizzo's cruel travesty of justice&mdash;how unfavourably
it compared with his cousin's altogether satisfactory,
straightforward and businesslike handling of Muhlen's little
affair!</p>

<p>Doubtless she suffered intensely. He called to mind her looks,
her voice, during that first interview at the villa Mon Repos; he
thought it likely that, but for her child and husband, she would
have taken her own life in order to escape from this villain. And
doubtless she had weighed the matter in her own mind. Sensible
people do not take steps of this gravity without reflecting on the
possible consequences. She must have tried her hardest to talk
Muhlen over, before coming to the conclusion that thee was nothing
to be done with the fellow. She knew him; she knew her own mind.
She knew better than anyone else what was in store for her if
Muhlen got the upper hand. Her home broken up; her child a bastard;
herself and Meadows&mdash;social outcasts; all their three lives
ruined. Mrs. Meadows, plainly, did not relish such a prospect. She
did not see why her existence should be wrecked because a scoundrel
happened to be supported by a disreputable paragraph of the Code.
Muhlen was a troublesome insect. He must be brushed aside.
Ridiculous to call such a thing a tragedy!</p>

<p>He thought of the insignificance of a human life. Thousands of
decent upright folks swept away at a blow...Who cared? One dirty
blackmailer more or less: what on earth did it matter to
anybody?</p>

<p>An enigma? His cousin was not an enigma at all. Keith had called
her a tiger mother. That was correct. Not every parent could do
what she had done. Not every parent could do what she had done. Not
every parent was placed under the necessity. Not every parent had
the grit. If all of them fought for their offspring after this
fashion, the race would be stronger and better. Thinking thus, he
not only understood. He approved. Mrs. Meadows had saved her
family. She was perfect of her kind.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered that other parent on the passenger boat
when he came to Nepenthe&mdash;that ugly peasant-woman dressed in
black, with the scar across her cheek&mdash;how she had tried to
console her suffering child. What had Muhlen said? "Throw it into
the water! It's often the only way of ridding oneself of a
nuisance." Into the water. His own words. That was where he, the
nuisance, had gone. It was unpleasant, maybe, to hurtle through
eight hundred feet of air. But men who specialize in making
themselves objectionable after Muhlen's peculiar fashion deserve
all they can get. Sensible women do not put up with such nonsense,
if they can help it.</p>

<p>One owes something to one's self, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>?</p>

<p>Decidedly so.</p>

<p>Everything was as clear as daylight. And he found he had
bothered himself long enough about Muhlen; there were so many other
interesting things on earth. A contemptible little episode! He
decided to relegate it into the category of unimportant events. He
was glad that the whole affair had remained in the background, so
to speak, of his Nepenthean experiences. It seemed appropriate.
Odd, all the same, that the most respectable woman on the island
should be a murderess.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he mused. "How very queer. It never struck me in the
light before. Shows how careful one must be...And a relation of
mine into the bargain. H'm. Some people, if they knew, would call
it a compromising situation. Well, I begin to think it rather
creditable than otherwise to our family. We want more women of this
kind on earth. All mothers ought to be tiger mothers..."</p>

<p>"Don't you notice, Count, that there is an unwonted sparkle in
the air this evening? Something cleansing, clarifying?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I do," replied the other. "And I can tell you the
cause of it. Sirocco is over for the present. The wind has shifted
to the north. It brightens all nature. It makes one see things in
their true perspective, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I feel," said Mr. Heard.</p>

<p>The symposium, that evening, might have degenerated into
something like an orgy but for the masterful intervention of Denis
who was not going to let Keith make a fool of himself. It took
place in the most famous of all the caves of Nepenthe-Luisella's
grotto-cavern dedicated, by common usage, to the worship of Venus
and Bacchus.</p>

<p>There were two or three living rooms on the surface of the
ground. Walking through the first of these you clambered down some
slippery stairs into what was once a breathless subterranean vault
hewn out of the soft and dry pumiceous rock and used, as was
customary, for storing barrels and other paraphernalia. In the
course of time, as more barrels accumulated, the grotto was
excavated further and further into the entrails of the island.
There seemed no reason why it should ever cease growing when
suddenly, one day, the perspiring workmen were struck in the face
by a cool blast of wind laden with marine moisture. They knew what
this meant. They had encountered one of those mysterious and
dangerous fissures that lead down to unknown depths, opening upon
the world of sunshine often at the water's edge, four hundred feet
below. It was deemed prudent to suspend excavations. These rents in
the interior of the earth had a knack of enlarging themselves,
without a word of warning, from cracks of a few inches to black
gulfs several hundred feet across. The cavern ceased to grow. As a
matter of fact, it turned out to be just large enough.</p>

<p>That current of air ventilating the grotto made the fortune of
these orphan girls&mdash;Luisella and her three sisters. The
barrels and other lumber once removed, the recess became a breezy
night-tavern, its natural vaulting being first whitewashed and then
adorned, by master-hand, with thrilling pictures of crimson fish
afloat upon caerulean waves, and piles of bossy pumpkins, and birds
of Paradise with streaming golden feathers, and goats at pasture
among blue lilies, and horses prancing over emerald mountains, and
trees laden with flowers and fruits such as no mortal had ever seen
or tasted. It was an ideal place for a carousal.</p>

<p>They could cook, those girls. Their savoury stews and vegetable
soups and fritters of every description were known far and wide. It
was universally agreed that nobody could make a more appetizing
mayonnaise sauce for cold fish and lobsters. No mayonnaise was
quite like theirs; no, not quite. Its flavour lingered on the
palate; it haunted your memory in distant lands, like the
after-glow of some happy love-affair. Nice girls, too;
well-mannered; not very difficult to caress, and never jealous of
each other. "It's all in the family," they used to declare.</p>

<p>"Am I right, then, or am I wrong?" asked Mr. Keith, whose
pomposity was melting away under successive bottles of his own
wine, specially imported to grace the table.</p>

<p>The honest Vice-President of the Club, Mr. Richards, was pretty
far gone, but could always be relied upon to say something
opposite. That was due to his legal training. Once a thriving
solicitor, he had been struck off the rolls in consequence of some
stupid trustee business which turned out all wrong and thereafter
driven along devious paths known only to himself: hence his
residence on Nepenthe. He replied:</p>

<p>"That depends entirely, my dear Sir, upon what you
postulated."</p>

<p>"The older I get," observed Mr. van Koppen, "the more I realize
that everything depends upon what a man postulates. The rest is
plain sailing."</p>

<p>"I never heard a truer remark," said Keith, "not even from you!
One has only to posit a thing, and it's done. Don't you agree,
Bishop? Here is what I would call a worn-out earthenware plate. It
is not a plate unless I tell it to be a plate. You may call it
anything you like&mdash;it can't answer back. But we need not
pursue the argument. Speaking for myself, I am feeling as
comfortable as a beetle in a rose."</p>

<p>The Vice-President remarked:</p>

<p>"We all know what it means when Mr. Keith becomes horticultural
in his similes. It means the same thing as when I become legal.
Gentlemen! I propose to grow legal within the next half-hour or
so."</p>

<p>"You promised to tell me the history of your cannas," said Mr.
Heard.</p>

<p>"You were going to tell it me too," answered Denis.</p>

<p>"I did. I was. And I will. But let me ask you this: have you
ever heard of a teetotaler conspicuous for kindliness of heart, or
intellectually distinguished in any walk of life? I should be glad
to know his name. A sorry crew! Not because they drink water, but
because the state of mind which makes them dread alcohol is
unpropitious to the hatching of any generous idea. <i>When men have
well drunk</i>. I like that phrase. <i>When men have well
drunk</i>. I am inclined to think that the Aramaic text has not
been tampered with at this point. What do you say, Heard?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is more improbable," replied the bishop. "And the
water, you perceive, was changed into wine; not into cocoa or
lemonade. That conveys, if I am not mistaken, rather a suggestive
implication."</p>

<p>"I have been pursuing Seneca's letters. He was a cocoa-drinker,
masquerading as an ancient. An objectionable hypocrite! I wish
people would read Seneca instead of talking about him."</p>

<p>Van Koppen observed:</p>

<p>"What a man postulates is truer than what exists. I have grown
grey in trying to make my fellow-creatures understand that
realities are less convincing than make-believe."</p>

<p>"Given the proper atmosphere," said the bishop, laughing,
"everything becomes inevitable. If you were wrong, Mr. van Koppen,
where would our poets and novelists be?"</p>

<p>"Where are they?" queried the American.</p>

<p>"How shall that come out of a man," continued Mr. Heard, "which
was never in him? How shall he generate a harmonious atmosphere if
he be disharmonious himself? It is all a question of plausibility,
of verisimi&mdash;simili&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never heard a more profound remark, Koppen, no, nor a more
subtle one; not even from you. Nor yet from you, Heard. And I can
tell you something to the point. I was talking this afternoon with
a gentleman about the stage. I said it made me said to see
flesh-and-blood people pretending to be kings and queens. Because
it cannot be done. No sensible person can bring himself to believe
it. But when you watch some of these local marionette theatres the
illusion is complete. Why is a poppy show more convincing than the
<i>Comdie Franaise</i>? Because it is still further removed from
reality. There is so much make-belief that you cease to struggle.
You succumb without an effort. You are quite disposed, you are
positively anxious, to make concessions to the improbable. Once
they are made&mdash;why, as you say, it is plain sailing."</p>

<p>"All life is a concession to the improbable," observed the
bishop rather vaguely.</p>

<p>Mr. Richards remarked:</p>

<p>"These questions must be approached with an open mind. An open
mind, gentlemen, is not necessarily an empty one."</p>

<p>"A fine distinction!"</p>

<p>"Very well. Mr. Keith proposes to abolish theatres. I second the
motion. Nothing is easier. Let me draw up a memorial to the House
of Lords. We will appeal to them on moral grounds. I know the
proper language. <i>Whereas by the grace of God your petitioners
humbly protest that there is too much kissing on the
stage</i>&mdash;ah! Talking of kissing, here comes our friend Don
Francesco. He shall put his name to the memorial and seal it with
an oath. No Englishman can resist a Monsignor. And nothing like a
solemn oath. People always think you mean it."</p>

<p>That amiable personage strode down the stairs in dignified
fashion, greeting the guests with a sonorous:</p>

<p>"<i>Pax Vobiscum</i>!"</p>

<p>He could not be induced to stay long, however. He had been
perturbed all day on account of the Duchess who now threatened to
join the Moravian Brotherhood; she was so annoyed about a little
thing which had happened. He did not quite believe it, of course;
but, like a well-trained priest, took nothing for granted and was
prepared for every emergency where ladies are concerned.</p>

<p>"Just one glass!" said Keith.</p>

<p>"Let me drink to your health ere we part," added the bishop. "I
am sorry to leave you. Our friendship will endure. We meet in
September, during the vintage season. Keith has been talking to me.
I am as wax in his hands. Your smile, Don Francesco, will follow me
across the ocean. Just one glass!"</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" said the priest. "The next best thing to leading
others astray is to be led astray oneself."</p>

<p>He gulped down a couple of tumblers and dutifully took his
leave, turning round, as he reached the staircase, to make a
playful gesture of benediction towards the assembled company.</p>

<p>"Don't leave your bottle half empty," Keith called after him,
imploringly. "It looks untidy."</p>

<p>"And so unhappy," added the bishop. "Dear me! This is most
singular. I seem to see two lamps instead of one. It must have been
those apricots."</p>

<p>Keith interposed:</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you strained one of your eyes bathing. It has
happened to me, occasionally. Darkness is the best remedy. It rests
the optic nerve."</p>

<p>"Shall we take a turn or two outside?" asked Denis.</p>

<p>It was past midnight as the two climbed out of the cave into the
night air. A cool north wind blew across the market-place. The
bishop was filled with a sense&mdash;a clear-cut, all-convincing
sense&mdash;of the screamingly funny insignificance of everything.
Then he noticed the moon.</p>

<p class="caption">The Bishop Sees Two Moons</p>

<p>It dangled over the water, waning, sickly, moth-eaten,
top-heavy, and altogether out of condition&mdash;as if it had been
on duty for weeks on end. In other respects, too, its appearance
was not quite normal. In fact, it soon took to behaving in the most
extraordinary fashion. Sometimes there were two moons, and
sometimes one. They seemed to merge together&mdash;to glide into
each other, and then to separate again. Mr. Heard was vastly
pleased and puzzled by the phenomenon&mdash;so pleased that he gave
utterance to one of the longest speeches he had made since his
arrival on Nepenthe. He said:</p>

<p>"I have seen many funny things here, Denis. But this is the
funniest of all. The spectacle seems to have been providentially
arranged, as a sort of <i>bonne bouche</i>, for my last evening on
the island. Dear me. Now there are two again. And now they are
behind each other once more. A kind of celestial hide and seek.
Most interesting. I wish Keith could see it. Or that dear Count
Caloveglia. He would be sure to say something polite...The
inconstant moon! I know, at last, what the poet meant by that
expression, though the word inconstant strikes me as hardly
forcible enough. The skittish moon, I should be inclined to call
it. The skittish moon. The frivolous moon. The giddy moon. The
quite-too-absurd moon...There it goes again! Very curious. What can
it be?...Why, this is the reverse of an eclipse, my boy. The disk
is darkened during an eclipse. It disappears <i>in vacuo</i>. In
the present case it is brightened and rendered, so to speak, doubly
apparent. What would you call the reverse of an eclipse, Denis?
Anti-eclipse? That sounds rather barbaric to my ears. One should
never mix Greek and Latin, if it can possibly be avoided.
Well?"</p>

<p>"We must have a good look at this thing from your window, and
then find out all about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I could not possibly take you from your friends! I know
my way home perfectly well. You will not dream of accompanying
me."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will. I walked with you to that house when you first
arrived here, and helped you to unpack. Don't you remember? And now
you must let me take you there on our last evening..."</p>

<p>By the time Denis returned to the grotto a more exuberant and
incoherent tone had been generated among the guests. He was not
pleased. He felt inclined to be stern. A number of reprobates from
the Club had dropped in, and Keith, whom he meant to keep straight
for one night at least, was saying silly things and giving himself
away. So was the excellent Mr. Richards.</p>

<p>"This is a good island," observed that gentleman. "We discourse
like sages and drink like swine. Peace with Honour!...How that old
Jew took our English measure, eh? How he laughed in his sleeve at
our infatuation for a phrase like that. Peace with Honour! The sort
of claptrap that makes a man feel so jolly comfortable inside, so
damned satisfied with everything like after a good deed. And that
sentimental primrose business. Dizzy as flower-expert! What cared
he for primroses? Votes and moneybags was what he was after. But he
knew the British Public. And that accounts for the pious domestic
button-hole. Who ever heard of a Jew telling the difference between
a primrose and any other kind of rose? They're not such blasted
fools."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Keith, rising from his seat in an afflatus of
inspiration. "Excuse me. I know the difference. It is primarily a
question of nutrition. Glucose! I am a great believer in glucose.
Because, even if it could be proved that the monks of Palaiokastron
stripped the vine of its leaves and thereby hastened the maturing
of the grape without reducing its natural supply of
sugar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't shine," interrupted Denis, "when you talk like
that."</p>

<p>"Because even if this could be proved, which I greatly doubt,
yet nothing on earth will make me believe that glucose is otherwise
than beneficial to vegetation. Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Keith. You are monopolizing the conversation."</p>

<p>"Because the glucose resides within that verdant foliage like
truth in her well, like the oyster within its pearl. The monks of
Palaiokastron&mdash;they got it straight from Noah. I am a great
believer in glucose. Which is absurd. Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up! You are making a perfect exhibition of yourself.
Can't you oblige me, for once in the way?"</p>

<p>Denis was growing seriously alarmed for the reputation of his
friend. He had changed of late; he was beginning to know his own
mind. He meant to put a stop to this humiliating scene. As the
other, regardless of his pleadings, continued to babble dithyrambic
nonsense concerning glucose and self-fertilization and artificial
manures and inflorescence and Assyrian bas-reliefs and Stilton
cheese, he suddenly gripped his arm and pulled him, with a crash,
into his chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, you double-distilled owl!"</p>

<p>This was the first virile achievement of his young life, and
directed to a worthy end. For it was obvious to the meanest
intelligence that Mr. Keith was considerably drunk. Too surprised
to utter a word of protest, the orator paused in his declamation,
beaming blandly at nobody in particular. Then he remarked, in quite
a subdued tone of voice:</p>

<p>"We are all at the mercy of youth. Mr. Richards! Could you
oblige me with a fairy-tale?"</p>
