  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE saffron glow in the evening sky filtered into the
  dining- room at Oversands, and caused the candles on the table to gleam
  fitfully under their green shades. The rest of the room was in shadow, picked
  out here and there by the dull gleam of polished oak, the gold picture
  frames, and the flash of silver on the sideboard. The wax candles made pools
  of light upon the table, at which three people were seated. At the head, Sir
  Horace Amory sat, facing his daughter Vera. Lady Amory had been long dead,
  and to Vera she was little more than a memory.</p>

  <p>Over against the old Elizabethan sideboard sat Maria, Lady Amory, widow of
  Sir Gabriel Amory, Sir Horace's deceased uncle, from whom he had inherited
  the title and the property. There are few families of standing without some
  strange story or whispered rumour, and the Amorys were no exception to the
  rule. The servants in the house and the people in the village generally spoke
  of Lady Amory with a significant glance or a smile as the case might be.</p>

  <p>It was not that she was old; indeed, in years she had the advantage of Sir
  Horace. She was beautifully dressed, her face knew no wrinkles, her hair was
  glossy and abundant. Yet she conveyed the strange, uncomfortable impression
  that she was a dead thing behind a mask of wax, a corpse that had been
  galvanised into life. There were times when she talked on everyday topics
  glibly, though always with an effort, and nobody had ever seen smile on that
  regular face&mdash;the mask never relaxed.</p>

  <p>She had her moods, too; there were days when she kept to the seclusion of
  her room and refused to see anybody; at other times she would come down to
  meals without a word or a sign to those at the table. If she had feeling or
  affection for a living soul it was for Dick Amory, Sir Horace's scapegrace
  son, who had elected to try his fortune on the Stock Exchange.</p>

  <p>The cause of all this was unknown. The tale ran that Sir Gabriel Amory had
  passed most of his time in the South of France, and had not been in England
  for many years, while his wife had never been seen until after his death,
  when she came as a legacy to Oversands. Her secret&mdash;if secret she
  had&mdash;she kept rigidly to herself. Years ago she had expressed a desire
  to have a place of her own, and had taken a large rambling cottage on the far
  side of the River Fleem, about five miles away. But she was hardly ever
  there, and seemed to prefer Oversands for the most part. Still, there were
  certain black hours, when she disappeared and took up her quarters at the
  cottage, waited upon by a grim, silent old man and his wife, who had been
  with her all her lifetime.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace, however, had not the remotest notion who this strange relation
  of his really was. He could have answered no questions concerning her
  parentage or pedigree. That she was a lady was evident. He supposed that she
  was wealthy, but even this was pure surmise. On occasions she wore amazing
  jewels, but she was neither more nor less than a mystery, and therewith Sir
  Horace was fain to be content.</p>

  <p>It was a quiet meal, slow and decorous, and a trifle prolonged for so
  small a family gathering. Sir Horace was rather given to ceremony. The Amorys
  were not an old family, Sir Horace being the third of his line. Oversands had
  come into their possession eighty years before, having been purchased by the
  first baronet net after he acquired the title. Their wealth had mainly been
  made in the town of Shoremouth, close by, and the banking firm of Amory and
  Sons was an important concern still; not what it had been, of course, since
  the advent of the gigantic joint-stock banks, but a great many people in the
  town and the country round swore by Amorys. Sir Horace was highly esteemed
  and his position dignified.</p>

  <p>And yet he did not altogether look the part of a local magnate as he sat
  at the head of his dining-table playing with his glass. There was a moody
  frown on his face, a suggestion of anxiety in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Usually Vera Amory would have been quick to remark this, but she also
  appeared to be wrapped up in her own thoughts this evening. She was a dainty
  little creature, happy of disposition, and generally wore a sunny smile on
  her fascinating face. She had courage and resolution, too, or the firm lines
  of her mouth belied her.</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't mind he'll be in the quicksands!" Lady Amory cried.</p>

  <p>Her voice rang in the silent room with a startling suddenness, but the
  remark passed unheeded. These weird suggestions were quite in the ordinary
  course. The words were loud and distinct, but the wax mask was graven and
  placid as ever.</p>

  <p>"The sands will keep their secret," the speaker went on; "but I know them.
  If anybody says that I pushed her in, they lie. She committed suicide."</p>

  <p>Again the words rang clear and still, though Lady Amory sat placidly
  eating an orange. A frown of annoyance crossed Sir Horace's face. There were
  times when this sort of thing irritated him, and Vera intervened.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, aunt," she said, soothingly. "It was no fault of yours.
  Won't you come into the drawing-room with me and have some music?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to bed," Lady Amory muttered. "If I don't it will get in
  the&mdash;everything gets into the newspapers nowadays. But they were
  disappointed about the inquest."</p>

  <p>Vera led her away gently. The poor creature was in one of her worst moods
  to-night. Lady Amory suffered herself to be conducted upstairs.</p>

  <p>"Keep away from the quicksands," she said; "and don't go near the Red
  House. It's safe for me because I know the secret, but you must avoid the
  place."</p>

  <p>The warning was uttered in a hoarse whisper. Vera shuddered slightly. That
  dangerous and desolate spot by the river near the old Red House had always
  been a nightmare to her. Gruesome legends hung around it. But why, Vera
  wondered, should that place be for ever uppermost in the mind of Lady Amory?
  She could not speak half-a-dozen sentences without alluding to it. More than
  once when she had wandered from the house she had been found sitting, gazing
  intently into those boiling, shifting grey sands, whence nothing ever emerged
  alive that had been engulfed in their deadly coils.</p>

  <p>With a long sigh of relief Vera found herself alone. The studied calm left
  her face, and she looked anxious and unhappy. Black and bitter trouble was
  coming, none the less dreadful because Vera had foreseen it for a long time.
  She took a letter from her pocket and read it again, though she had the words
  by heart:</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    "Meet me by the Red House at ten to-night.<br>
    You must manage to slip away.<br>
    I am in the most awful trouble and dare not show up.<br>
    <br>
    DICK."
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>It was not the first time that Dick Amory had distinguished himself in
  this fashion. His debts had been paid for him more than once; there had been
  stormy scenes and promises of reform, and on the last occasion Sir Horace had
  said that in future Dick must look to himself. But this fresh difficulty
  shaped like a still blacker and more bitter business. If Dick dared not show
  himself at home, then disgrace, dishonour, and other dreadful things that
  Vera did not dare to imagine too closely, seemed imminent. Was it possible
  that the police&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sir Horace must be told. It was far too serious a problem for Vera to
  grapple single-handed. It was out of the question that she should go as far
  as the lonely Red House at that hour of the night. Vera went off at once to
  the library, where she found her father smoking his after-dinner cigar. He
  was not alone, as she had expected. A tall young man, with a pleasant,
  resolute face, lighted by frank, steady grey eyes, stood by the fireplace. He
  looked very handsome and manly in his evening dress. His features were oddly
  familiar to Vera.</p>

  <p>"You need not go away, dear," Sir Horace said. "This is Mr. Ronald
  Bastable, the son of my old steward, Joseph Bastable."</p>

  <p>"It is a long time since I saw you last, Miss Vera," the young man
  said.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen years, isn't it?" Vera smiled. "We were good friends in those
  days."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace frowned. Ronald Bastable appeared to forget that only a few
  years ago his father had been employed on the Oversands estates in quite a
  subordinate capacity. Joseph Bastable had made money since then. Half the new
  houses in the rising watering-place belonged to him, but though he had given
  his only son a public school and university education, he was still the
  ex-steward in Sir Horace's eyes. There had been a bitter quarrel between them
  two years ago, and Joseph Bastable had sworn that Sir Horace should eat his
  words some day.</p>

  <p>But Vera remembered nothing of this now. The young man before her had been
  her playmate. He had shown her where early violets and primroses were to be
  found, and had brought many additions to the collection of birds' eggs she
  had been so proud of in those days. Moreover, Ronald Bastable was plainly a
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"My brother would be pleased to see you again," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's strange you should mention his name," Bastable replied. "I came on
  purpose to get his address. I called at his office in town, and they said he
  was probably here."</p>

  <p>"My son hardly ever comes here," Sir Horace said, stiffly. "I regret I
  cannot help you."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Vera that Bastable was looking grave, not to say anxious.</p>

  <p>"Is it of importance?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Bastable answered. "I am sorry not to be able to speak more
  freely, but my business is strictly private. All I can say is that I am
  extremely disappointed not to find your brother's address."</p>

  <p>A vague alarm possessed Vera. Was Bastable speaking to her in a language
  not meant for Sir Horace's ears. It was impossible to listen to those words
  without feeling that there was something behind them. The speaker was
  sympathetic, too. He would be a good and loyal friend in the hour of need. An
  impulse to take him into her confidence gripped Vera. It was singular that,
  after all these years, she should meet Ronald Bastable again in her present
  dilemma.</p>

  <p>"I am vexed," she said; "I would help you if I could. But I am
  interrupting your talk. Good-night, Mr. Bastable."</p>

  <p>She slipped out of the room before any effort was made to detain her, but
  stood in the shadow of the drawing-room waiting eagerly. Come what might, she
  would take Ronald Bastable into her confidence. At any rate, he would respect
  her secret, and it might be a matter of life or death to Dick.</p>

  <p>She heard the library door open presently, and saw Ronald cross the hall.
  Sir Horace bade his visitor a formal good-night, and fastened the front door
  behind him. No sooner was he safe in the library again than Vera rapidly
  crossed the drawing-room and opened the long French window leading to the
  lawn. The tall, athletic figure of Ronald Bastable was disappearing down the
  drive. There was not a moment to lose.</p>

  <p>She ran across the grass, and laid a timid hand on Ronald's arm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">Bastable's eyes shone softly as he turned to his companion.
  He could see she was in distress. The pleading expression of her face was
  sufficient to tell him that.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't think this is wrong," she said. "But I have not
  forgotten. I know your father and mine are bitter enemies, but that is no
  reason why we should not be friends. It seemed strange that you should come
  to Oversands to-night of all times, but I see the hand of Providence in it.
  My brother is in trouble!"</p>

  <p>Bastable appeared to hesitate for a moment. "Has he told you this, Miss
  Vera?" he asked. "Sir Horace does not know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my father knows nothing. The news only came to me just before dinner.
  It reached me in the form of a note delivered by a child. Have you seen Dick
  lately?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen a good deal of him in London. I am a barrister, Miss Amory,
  and belong to the same club as your brother, and more than once I have been
  in a position to give him some little, well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have lent him money?" Vera exclaimed. "How odd that Dick should never
  have mentioned your name in his letters! But I am wasting time. My brother
  has got into some very serious trouble. He tells me that he dare not show his
  face at Oversands. Mr. Bastable, is it really as bad as that?"</p>

  <p>Bastable looked down into the white, sad face that was turned to his. "I
  am afraid so," he said, gently. "Dick gave me a hint to that effect a night
  or two ago. He was anxious that I should advise him. I am inclined to believe
  that he did not tell me everything, but so far as I could gather it was very
  bad."</p>

  <p>"You mean that that foolish boy has&mdash;has disgraced us?"</p>

  <p>Bastable was silent for a while. Vera's worst fears were confirmed. "Your
  brother is very friendly with a lawyer called Bowen," he went on presently.
  "I fear that Bowen and Dick have been speculating with the property of a
  client of Bowen's&mdash;an old lady who died recently. Her trustees have
  asked for accounts, and the whole thing must come out. Unless something like
  twenty thousand pounds is forthcoming in the next few hours it is probable
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for Bastable to say more. The thing was as plain as
  daylight to Vera. Dick was little better than a thief&mdash;a criminal flying
  from justice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is dreadful," the girl whispered. "It will break my father's
  heart. But we must save that wretched boy if we can, Mr. Bastable. Have you
  any scheme&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would it not be as well to find out where he is first?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I had forgotten that!" Vera cried. "Dick is hiding at the Red House.
  That dreadful place always had a fascination for him. In his letter he says
  he will be there by ten o'clock to-night, and wants me to meet him. I could
  not do it&mdash;I have as much pluck as most girls&mdash;but I simply dare
  not go. When I came into the library to-night, I was going to tell my father
  everything. Ought he not to know?"</p>

  <p>"Not just now," Bastable said after a pause. "It is possible I may be able
  to save the situation. I'll go and see Dick for you. I will explain how his
  address came into my hands. You had better return to the house lest anybody
  should discover that you have been out."</p>

  <p>"How can I thank you for all this kindness?" Vera murmured. "But you will
  let me know soon? I shall not have a moment's peace so long as that poor
  boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will see you to-morrow?" Bastable suggested. "You must meet me
  somewhere. I know it is awkward, but in the circumstances it would be
  imprudent to write. Shall we say to-morrow at midday in the yew avenue?"</p>

  <p>"Where we used to meet for one of our stolen expeditions," Vera smiled
  faintly. "How far off those days appear to be! And to think that you should
  come back into my life in this fashion. But I must go. Good-night, Mr.
  Bastable!"</p>

  <p>She held out her hands with a sudden impulse that touched Bastable. How
  sweet and fair and dainty she had grown, to be sure! He had never forgotten
  his little playmate, though he had not seen her for years. Most of the time
  she had been at school, and after that quarrel between Sir Horace and his
  father, Oversands had been a closed place to him. Now she was talking to him
  as if there were no social gulf between them. Her hands lay in his&mdash;he
  raised one of them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"I have always remembered you," he said. "I was glad to help you in the
  old days, and I will help you now, Miss Vera. If by any possible chance your
  brother can be saved it shall be done. I have a scheme in my mind, but this
  is not the time or place to discuss it."</p>

  <p>"I must try to be patient till to-morrow," Vera murmured.</p>

  <p>"Twelve o'clock to-morrow. I only hope I may bring you good news."</p>

  <p>Bastable turned away more or less abruptly and strode down the drive. The
  full round shield of the silver moon was rising, and his shadow fell on the
  undergrowth. He had the best part of an hour's walk before him if he wished
  to reach the Red House near ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>He had ample food for thought as he walked along. He was recalling the old
  days when he and Vera had been children together, she a pretty little thing
  of seven, he a boy of 12. Then his father had been merely an upper servant of
  Sir Horace's; but the quarrel followed, and Joseph Bastable was summarily
  dismissed. There had been some suggestion of dishonesty, but that might have
  been only idle gossip.</p>

  <p>Many things had happened in the past 14 years. In that interval the
  fortunes of the Amorys had gone back, whilst Joseph Bastable had flourished
  exceedingly. He had set up in Shoremouth as an agent just at the time when
  the place had begun to prosper. He had speculated boldly but shrewdly in
  land, with the result that to-day, as we have said, half the town belonged to
  him. He had been mainly instrumental in bringing to Shoremouth the joint
  stock bank that had affected the prosperity of Amory and Sons. He boasted
  more or less openly that he would bring Sir Horace to his knees and drive him
  out of Oversands. He had made a gentleman of Ronald&mdash;but, then, Ronald
  was a gentleman in any case.</p>

  <p>Joseph Bastable had other ambitions, but these he did not mention in
  public. He had discussed them with Ronald to the younger man's embarrassment.
  However, it looked as if fate were about to crystallise these dreams into
  concrete realities.</p>

  <p>The moon was riding high in the blue dome when Ronald left the high ground
  for the flat marshes by the side of the river. Here it was dreary and
  desolate to a degree. It seemed almost impossible to believe that the sylvan
  beauties of Oversands were so near, that within two miles lay the attractive
  town of Shoremouth.</p>

  <p>The tide was out, and the wide range of sands lay bleak and deserted. At
  certain spots it was possible to cross the river by means of flat rocks that
  formed stepping-stones, but these depended upon the conditions of the tide,
  and now and again they were covered with slimy sand and weed that made the
  passage dangerous. One false step and there was an end of you. The shifting
  quicksands were capable of sucking down a good-sized boat without leaving a
  single trace behind.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards or so back from the mud and sands stood a house that bore
  some resemblance to a martello tower. It was a wild and lonely spot, and
  there were various legends to account for the building of it. It had never
  been occupied in the recollection of the oldest inhabitant, though it was
  partially furnished. There had been a rumour lately that Sir Horace had been
  sounded by a prospective tenant, but he had not confirmed it. The place
  looked grim and repellent now in the glare of the moon. Ronald approached the
  building carelessly&mdash;he was not in the least afraid of meeting anybody,
  though it was a spot that most people avoided after dark.</p>

  <p>The door yielded as Ronald pushed it; in the dingy sitting-room somebody
  had been smoking, for the musty atmosphere smelt strongly of tobacco. Very
  softly Bastable called Dick Amory by name. The call was repeated three times
  before any reply came. Then a head was cautiously thrust round the doorway
  from the hall, and Dick Amory entered listlessly. There was an unsteady smile
  on his weak, handsome face, and the irresolute lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"How you frightened me!" he whispered. "I've been sitting in this infernal
  old kennel till my nerves are all to pieces. How did you manage to find
  me?"</p>

  <p>Bastable proceeded to explain. Amory listened gloomily.</p>

  <p>"It's uncommon good of you, old chap," he said. "Well, the mischief is
  done, and there is no help for it. I expect they have issued a warrant by
  this time. I should have gone and made a clean breast of it to the old man,
  but I didn't dare to show myself at Oversands. I'll have to get you to do it
  for me, Bastable. Don't forget to let me have some cigarettes and whisky
  to-morrow. I can manage till then. So long as I lie close I'm safe here until
  the governor can find the money. It will be a bit of a pull for him,
  especially as things haven't gone very well lately. What a fool I was to let
  Bowen drag me into this mess! I never had a penny of the money. It's an
  infernal shame that I should be the one to suffer!"</p>

  <p>Amory's voice faded into a whine and something like tears stood in his
  eyes. It was almost impossible to sympathise with a poor weak creature like
  this. It was hard to believe that this was a relation of Vera Amory's.</p>

  <p>"I should drop that if I were you," Bastable said, sternly. "There is
  nothing to be gained by self-pity. I have a scheme of sorts, and I want you
  to follow me carefully. I don't say that I shall be able to save you, but I'm
  going to have a good try. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Amory grasped the arm of his companion with convulsive force. His face was
  white and set with ghostly fear. He trembled violently. "Quiet!" he
  whispered. "There's someone in the house!"</p>

  <p>Bastable became rigid at attention. Surely enough somebody was shuffling
  along the hall towards the door. It seemed to Bastable that he could hear the
  notes of a tune coming from between half-closed lips. Then the door of the
  sitting-room opened a little and a hand lay upon the jamb. The
  hand&mdash;long, white, slim, with beautifully-moulded pink nails&mdash;stood
  out clear as a cameo in the white moonlight, and as it came so it
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that?" Bastable whispered. "You didn't? It was wonderfully
  plain. An exquisite slim white hand, with a superb old marquise diamond and
  ruby ring upon it. I should know that ring again anywhere!"</p>

  <p>Amory made no reply for the chattering of his teeth. He managed to find
  his voice again presently. "Don't move," he whispered. "Don't leave me.
  Perhaps the fellow has gone away. You never saw any ring; it was pure
  imagination on your part."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">For a moment Ronald Bastable was disposed to regard the
  whole thing as a delusion. The events of the evening had got upon his nerves,
  and the rest was a mere matter of imagination. But why should he be a prey to
  panic? He was young, clean-living, and clean-minded, and, moreover, in
  excellent training. The hand, too, had been so real; he had noticed the clear
  pinkness of the nails; he could recognise the marquise ring again
  anywhere.</p>

  <p>A cautious search of the house disclosed nothing in the way of a clue.
  There was no sign that anybody else had been there. The shabby old furniture
  and fusty carpets showed no trace of disturbance. The back door was fastened,
  and the rusty key was in the lock. As to the front door, Bastable had taken
  the precaution of securing it when he entered. It was still fast.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you imagined it all," Dick Amory said, irritably. "Don't keep harping
  upon that. I've got to remain alone in this dismal hole all night, and I
  don't want my mind filled with horrors. Now, what's to be done?"</p>

  <p>Apparently very little could be done as far as Bastable could see. A
  scheme was maturing in his mind, but the time was not ripe yet. He went off
  presently towards Shoremouth. He promised to look up Amory again in the
  morning. Just now he felt in the mood for company. It was not too late to
  turn into the club for an hour.</p>

  <p>The club of Shoremouth was somewhat of a new institution. There were a
  great many residents with plenty of time on their hands, retired soldiers and
  sailors and the like, who had come to the place on account of its bracing
  air, and there was also a fair sprinkling of visitors most of the year round.
  In the season the club was crowded with temporary members affiliated to
  various London institutions of a similar kind. The club was always open to
  visitors of undoubted social position.</p>

  <p>The smoking room was comparatively empty as Ronald entered. It would be a
  good idea to look at the London evening papers. He might glean some
  information as to what was happening as to the affair of Dick Amory and his
  quondam friend Bowen, the solicitor. Probably a warrant had been issued for
  the apprehension of both. If so, it would be well to know how the land lay.
  Perhaps, up to the present, no ugly suspicions had been aroused. Still, he
  must make sure.</p>

  <p>Ronald turned over an evening paper carefully. Here was something at
  length that promised to be of interest. It related to a missing
  solicitor:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    <b>"STRANGE AFFAIR IN IVY COURT."</b><br>
    <br>
    "The police authorities are investigating a remarkable affair in connection
    with the disappearance of a well-known city solicitor, Mr. Arthur Bowen by
    name. For some years past Mr. Bowen has tenanted offices situated in Ivy
    Court, Fenchurch-street, a blind thoroughfare occupied for the most part by
    warehouses. At the end of the court, facing the street, is a small house of
    two rooms, rented by Mr. Bowen, who retains the upstairs room for his own
    office, whilst the two clerks work downstairs. At certain times of the day
    the court is comparatively deserted, since the warehouses can be entered by
    side doors, and in any case are mostly used for the purposes of import and
    export only. Thus the majority of the people passing along the court are
    clients and solicitors, who come to call on Mr. Bowen.<br>
    <br>
    "Yesterday morning, Mr. Bowen came to business as usual. He greeted his two
    clerks in his usual cheery manner, and then proceeded to his own room to
    transact the business of the day. About 12 o'clock a telegram arrived from
    a client in the country who needed some papers urgently, and one of the
    clerks was despatched with them by train a few minutes after the receipt of
    the wire. At half-past 12 the other clerk went off to his lunch. On his
    return an hour later he found nobody in the office, for apparently Mr.
    Bowen had been called out on business.<br>
    <br>
    "As the cash-box was open and several important papers lay about, the clerk
    went to Mr. Bowen's room to see if anything was wrong. The room was empty,
    papers and documents were scattered about in disorder, and the large safe
    in the corner had vanished. The safe, weighing upwards of a ton, had been
    wrenched from the walls and carried away bodily. All the private books and
    ledgers had gone also, and no trace of Mr. Bowen could be seen. On the
    office table were several spots of blood and a soaked handkerchief with the
    unfortunate solicitor's monogram upon it.<br>
    <br>
    "We understand that, up to the time of going to press, the police have been
    unable to throw much, if any, light on the mystery. Nothing more has been
    seen of Mr. Bowen, and the authorities are compelled to believe that he has
    been the victim of foul play. If so, it passes comprehension how a brutal
    crime could have been accomplished in broad daylight within a few yards of
    a busy thoroughfare like Fenchurch-street."<br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>Ronald Bastable read the paragraph again. It certainly was a most
  remarkable chain of events. Bowen appeared to be a man who possessed powerful
  enemies. At any rate, this would mean a respite for Dick Amory. It would give
  him time to turn round and find the money he had embezzled along with Bowen.
  Ronald was about to throw the paper aside when something in the "stop press"
  edition attracted his attention:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    <b>"A CLUE TO THE IVY COURT MYSTERY."</b><br>
    <br>
    "Late this afternoon the police were called up on the telephone by a firm
    of carriers and furniture dealers carrying on business in College Place.
    The firm appear to have had an express letter from Mr. Brown asking that a
    van should be sent round to Ivy Court at one o'clock precisely to remove
    some furniture and a safe to premises in Orchard Lane. The van was
    despatched at the precise time mentioned in the letter, and the carter in
    charge was met at the entrance to the court by a gentleman, who informed
    him that the goods were not ready yet, but that they would be packed with
    as little delay as possible. The van was backed into the court, and the
    gentleman gave the driver, and vanman half-a-crown, at the same time
    telling them to get some refreshment, as their services would not be
    required or half an hour at least.<br>
    <br>
    "On the men returning at the expiration of the time, they found that the
    offices were empty and the van had been removed. The rooms were in a state
    of disorder, the safe had been cut from the wall, and no sign of it was to
    be seen. In the course of the afternoon the van was discovered near St.
    Paul's Churchyard, empty and apparently derelict. The police are now making
    a diligent search for a thin man of middle age with a dark moustache,
    speaking with a slight foreign accent, this being the description of the
    stranger who handed the half-crown to the vanman and his colleague. The
    police have satisfied themselves that the letter ordering the van and
    purporting to be in Mr. Bowen's handwriting is a forgery."<br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>Here was a fascinating mystery in itself, quite apart from any connection
  it might have with the fortunes of Dick Amory. It was a daring and original
  scheme, and had succeeded by reason of its simple audacity. Probably the
  telegram which had drawn one clerk out of the way was a blind. Beyond all
  question these scoundrels knew every detail of the daily routine in Bowen's
  office. They were aware that the lawyer was in the habit of being alone in
  his office for an hour in the middle of the day. It was the hour, too, when
  the business of the city was generally at a standstill; and if anybody did
  come along, a confederate could easily put him off with an excuse. A blow on
  the head would keep Bowen quiet whilst the thieves were removing the safe.
  The way in which they had obtained the van was ingenious. Here was a crime
  that London would already be discussing.</p>

  <p>One or two other people had lounged into the smoking-room. These persons
  were unknown to Ronald, and he put them down as visitors. Two men came in
  presently and sat down immediately opposite to him. They were evidently
  strangers, from the way in which they glanced about them. The elder of the
  two was tall and somewhat striking-looking; he had a fierce military
  moustache obviously dyed some purple hue and waxed in spikes that turned
  upwards. He wore a glass in his right eye, and he spoke to the waiter with a
  foreign accent. The other man appeared to be timid and retiring and glanced
  nervously about him as if afraid of something. His face was half-hidden
  behind a bushy beard and whiskers of iron grey; his eyes were shielded by
  blue glasses. Evidently the man suffered from some nervous trouble; plenty of
  such came to Shoremouth for the air at all times of the year. With a ready
  ease and politeness, the foreigner dropped into conversation with Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Very pleasant quarters you have here, sir," he said. "It's a change after
  the bustle and glitter of a London club. My friend, Sir George Lumley,
  recommended me to come here and bring my relative, Mr. Sexton. He's been
  working too hard, with the inevitable result. But they tell me there is no
  air like Shoremouth for nerves."</p>

  <p>"Many doctors recommend it," Ronald said.</p>

  <p>"Ah! They are right sir," the man with the purple moustache replied. "I
  feel the better for the change myself. I've had experience of climates all
  over the world, and I find none to beat England. I speak as a man of
  science."</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of settling here?" Ronald asked, casually.</p>

  <p>"Now, how did you guess that, sir?" the stranger asked, smilingly. His
  keen eyes played over Bastable like a searchlight. "You are a thought-reader.
  I have taken a hand in most matters connected with practical science, but my
  latest hobby is the flying machine. Without boasting, I can promise the world
  something new in that way before long. The difficulty is to find a quiet
  place for one's experiments. I believe that I have solved the problem here in
  Shoremouth. I'm talking of a place called the Red House. The place has a bad
  reputation, and most people give it a wide berth. Those lonely sands are an
  ideal place for aeroplane trials. Who owns the place?"</p>

  <p>"It is the property of Sir Horace Amory," Bastable explained.</p>

  <p>A queer smile played like summer lightning over the face of the stranger.
  His moustache seemed to disappear into his lip in a way that struck Ronald as
  sinister. The nervous little man seemed to be interested now.</p>

  <p>"I've heard the name before," the stranger said, drily. "I daresay Sir
  Horace will only be too glad to let the place, especially if I am prepared to
  take it as it stands. Sexton, I'll trouble you for the loan of a pencil. I'll
  take Sir Horace's address."</p>

  <p>The little man fished a pencil from his pocket, and the moustachioed
  stranger proceeded to remove one of his grey suede gloves. As he shot his
  hand free of his cuff, Ronald started. For a moment his glance was fixed on
  the hand of the newcomer.</p>

  <p>On his third finger he wore a ring. In ordinary circumstances there was
  nothing remarkable in that. But it happened to be the very marquise ring that
  Ronald had seen on the hand of the door jamb at the Red House! He looked
  again to see if he were mistaken. But it was no mistake, he could have sworn
  to that ring anywhere.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">It required an effort on Ronald's part to control himself
  and turn his gaze casually elsewhere. He was annoyed to find the nervous
  little man in the blue spectacles was regarding him suspiciously. But he was
  sure of his facts, and he was certain as to that magnificent ring. At the
  risk of incurring further suspicion he must have another look at the
  stranger. The ring was the same undoubtedly, but the hand was different. This
  was no long, slim white hand with perfectly manicured nails, pink and white
  and rounded, but a hand brown and sinewy, the knotted veins standing out from
  the hairy back like cords. Still, Ronald was far from satisfied.</p>

  <p>He was not at all taken with the stranger. The man's manner was easy; he
  was accustomed to good society; he was cultured and polished. But he was a
  little too friendly and plausible, and his eyes were those of a wolf. It was
  singular that a man of this type should view with a favourable eye such a
  desolate and dreary place as the Red House. His boast as to the aeroplane
  might be true, or it might be a blind to conceal something sinister. It was
  significant, too, that the foreigner should be enamoured of the place at the
  moment when it was imperative that the movements of Dick Amory should be kept
  secret.</p>

  <p>Ronald rose and strode casually into the hall, and thence to the bar. The
  steward was idle.</p>

  <p>"Who is the dark visitor with the eyeglass, Salmon?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman of the name of De Lava sir&mdash;Count Henri De Lava," the
  steward explained. "He came with Sir George Lumley's card. The other
  gentleman is an invalid and they are both staying at the Grand. They only
  joined this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Did they dine here, Salmon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. They came in about half-past six after a long walk. The
  gentleman in the spectacles seemed very tired and done up, and the count
  suggested dinner here, if we did that sort of thing. Mr. Sexton said he was
  too worn out to think of dressing for dinner, and I got them a chop,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"So that they could have a stroll upon the parade afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that, sir. They didn't. As a matter of fact, they went
  into the billiard-room, and had their coffee and cigarettes there. After that
  they adjourned to the smoking-room."</p>

  <p>Ronald went back to his seat satisfied to a certain extent, and yet more
  perplexed than ever. It was impossible to see his way. Still, he would keep
  his eye upon these strangers; he felt sure that in some way they meant
  mischief so far as Dick Amory was concerned. For the present they must not
  see the inside of the Red House. It would take some time to get the key from
  Sir Horace's agent, and Dick would, at any rate, be safe for another day.</p>

  <p>Ronald turned the problem over in his mind until he fell asleep, but no
  solution came to him. Directly after breakfast he examined the London papers.
  Most of them were full of the mysterious affair in Ivy Court, and many
  ingenious theories were advanced. It seemed almost impossible that a
  solicitor, together with all his papers, and most of his office furniture,
  should vanish in this way, but there was the hard fact, and there was no
  possibility of getting away from it. The police were inclined to think that
  Mr. Bowen had been enticed away, and had returned unexpectedly before the
  thieves had finished their work. He had then been stunned or murdered
  outright, and his body conveyed from the office in the van. The removal of
  Bowen was intended to baffle the authorities, and make it impossible to fix
  the direct charge of murder on anybody. In the absence of the body, it was
  not positively certain that he was dead.</p>

  <p>Bastable went off presently towards the Red House. With the events of the
  previous night uppermost in his mind it behoved him to be cautious. But no
  living soul was in sight as he strode along the marshes, nothing but
  sea-birds wheeling overhead, calling to one another like lost spirits in
  torment. The tide was out again, and the whole stretch of grey sands quivered
  and bubbled as if some unseen hand stirred their horrible depths; they
  churned and seethed round the flat stepping stones in a wickedly suggestive
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"So you've come at last," Amory said, none too graciously. "What a time
  you've been!"</p>

  <p>"It's barely eleven o'clock," Ronald replied.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it? It seems like afternoon to me. I had to pawn my watch to raise
  the money to get here, and I haven't a notion what the time is. Got the
  cigarettes?"</p>

  <p>"I've got enough to last you a week. The food difficulty is my great
  trouble. But, in any case, you'll have to find some other hiding-place. From
  what I could gather last night, there's a possibility of this house being let
  at once."</p>

  <p>Amory broke out passionately. "I wish I was dead!" he cried. "I wish I had
  never been born. Of course, by this time the police are looking for me
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy so," Ronald said, soothingly. "It's an ill wind that brings
  nobody luck, and you've got your turn, though it's at the expense of your
  friend Bowen. But I put a newspaper in my pocket so that you could read for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Amory snatched at the paper eagerly. Ronald watched him with a feeling of
  contempt. It was clear Dick Amory cared for nobody but himself. Whatever
  might happen, his personal safety was the first consideration. There was
  something like a smile on his face as he finished the report.</p>

  <p>"It's very odd, Bastable," he said. "But Bowen was mixed up with a shady
  lot. Well, this gives me breathing-time. No steps can be taken against me
  until it comes out that Bowen is a defaulter, and they can't prove that till
  his papers are produced. Still, one can never tell how far Bowen had
  committed himself. I think I'll stay here for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you can't," Bastable interrupted. "The thing is impossible. I met a
  man in the club last night who is exceedingly anxious to take this place. He
  is a foreigner who wants a quiet practise ground for a flying-machine he has
  invented. He has been over the marshes, and says the place will suit him
  admirably. He may get hold of the keys to-day, and if he does he is certain
  to be here to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"What sort of chap was he?" Amory asked at random.</p>

  <p>"A foreigner&mdash;a tall, slim man with a dyed moustache and an eyeglass.
  I fancy he calls himself De Lava or some such name&mdash;Count De Lava. He
  has a friend named Sexton, who appears to be somewhat of an invalid."</p>

  <p>Amory began to pace impatiently up and down the dingy sitting-room. He
  puffed nervously at his cigarette. Then he turned abruptly to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"You must manage to keep those chaps away a bit longer," he said. "I've
  been trying to think out a plan for getting this money. After all, I may not
  have to find it; at least I shan't be asked to do so until the police get to
  the bottom of the Bowen business. It's long odds that the thing remains a
  mystery altogether, in which case I stand on velvet."</p>

  <p>"But that's downright rascality," Ronald said, coldly. "You have robbed
  those people of this money, and you and Bowen have spent it between you. If
  those ruffians have made an end of Bowen, then you are responsible for it
  all."</p>

  <p>"Why should I interfere?" Amory asked. "If Bowen is dead, there is an end
  to the matter. He won't know that he has had all the blame, and I shall be
  free."</p>

  <p>Bastable turned away in silent disgust. "Let us assume," he said
  presently, "that Bowen isn't dead. Say that he comes back again. What will be
  your position then? It will be no excuse for Bowen to say that he has been
  robbed by a gang of scoundrels. He will have to produce the money all the
  same, and he will look for your share."</p>

  <p>"If he does, then I fancy I can see my way to find my half."</p>

  <p>"There will be no question as to half. If Bowen is penniless, as I expect,
  you will have to find the lot. You don't seem to realise how deeply you are
  plunged in this trouble. If you can see any way clear I shall be glad to hear
  what it is."</p>

  <p>"Well, there is my aunt, or my great-aunt, Lady Amory," Dick said. "She's
  queer, as you know. Some people think she is quite mad, but she's got more
  about her than folk imagine. And she's fond of me."</p>

  <p>"Is that a sign of sanity?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"You needn't rub it in," Amory said, sullenly. "She's been fond of me from
  a child. I can get more out of her than anybody else. She's got money, though
  she has always been very close on that score. People of weak intellects
  generally are. Did you ever see her when she's dressed for a big party?"</p>

  <p>"I have never had the pleasure," Ronald said, drily.</p>

  <p>"You should, my boy&mdash;that is, if you admire beautiful jewellery. The
  old lady has some of the finest diamonds and rubies in the country. Goodness
  only knows what they are worth. And she keeps them in a safe in her cottage.
  Now, if I could get hold of these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What, you're not suggesting the possibility of a
  further&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Amory went on. "My idea was to get the chance of a few
  words with the old lady and let her know how things are with me. If I pitched
  it pretty strong she might consent to pawn some of the gems to get me out of
  the present hole. She's staying at Oversands just now, and she generally has
  a lot of stuff with her. Of course, I don't want you to mention this to Vera,
  but you might ask her to arrange an interview with Lady Amory for me."</p>

  <p>There was no objection to this course as far as Ronald could see. He would
  lay the proposal before Vera, and afterwards discuss further arrangements for
  Dick Amory's safety.</p>

  <p>Vera was waiting impatiently in the new avenue. Her pale face lighted up
  and a splash of colour came into her cheeks as she saw Ronald, but in the
  bright sunshine she looked tired and worn.</p>

  <p>"I hope you have good news for me," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I have no bad," Ronald replied. "On the contrary, there is a respite that
  may enable us to tide over matters. But perhaps I had better explain."</p>

  <p>Vera listened eagerly to all that Ronald had to say. It was a relief to
  know that the blow was not to fall yet. "It is very, very kind of you," she
  said, gratefully. "We may find some way of stopping this terrible scandal
  altogether. I haven't a notion what Dick expects to gain by seeing Lady
  Amory, though she is fond of him; indeed, he is the one creature that she
  cares for. But I will try to make her understand. She is in the garden at the
  present moment. If you'll stay here, I'll go and speak to her."</p>

  <p>Ronald waited patiently. He could hear voices close by, Vera's soft and
  persuasive, and Lady Amory's vague and incoherent. They passed along a grass
  path so close to Ronald on the other side of the hedge that he could almost
  have touched them. Lady Amory was leaning on an ebony stick with a crutch
  ivory handle; her bare hand was clasped upon it.</p>

  <p>"Have patience," she said. "I shall understand presently. Now say it
  slowly. I never can think of anything when the tide is low on the
  quicksands."</p>

  <p>Ronald started, but not at these strange words. His gaze was fixed on Lady
  Amory's hand. It was the very hand and the very ring that he had seen on the
  door jamb at the Red House the night before.</p>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" he asked himself. "In heaven's name, what does it
  all mean?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">There was something fascinating in these developments,
  although this was one of the last places in which to look for full-blooded
  romance. For these were strange events to happen in a house like Oversands.
  Sir Horace was only a plain country gentleman with an interest in a banking
  business. Still, romance is a plant that often strikes deep roots and takes
  years to flower.</p>

  <p>Assuredly there was some connection between Lady Amory and the florid
  stranger who called himself Count De Lava. Why was this half-demented
  creature in the habit of visiting the Red House alone in the dead of the
  night? Few people in Shoremouth had the courage to enter the place after
  dark, and yet this poor weak woman had no hesitation in so doing. There was
  something uncanny about it all.</p>

  <p>But Ronald had other matters to occupy his attention just then. He could
  hear the murmur of conversation on the other side of the yew hedge, and, as
  far as he could gather, Vera was doing most of the talking. She seemed to be
  urging her companion, who replied every now and then somewhat vaguely.
  Bastable could catch a few words here and there, but they seemed to have
  little to do with the point.</p>

  <p>Vera came back presently with a grave look on her face. "I am afraid I
  have made a sad mess of it," she said. "I have tried to explain matters to my
  aunt, and I fear I have left her under the impression that something has
  happened to Dick. It is one of her worst days. If Dick could come here and
  see her, perhaps he could make her understand. He has always been a favourite
  of hers, and he can do almost anything he likes with her."</p>

  <p>"You mean that Lady Amory failed to understand?"</p>

  <p>"Utterly. I have only confused her. Can you suggest anything?"</p>

  <p>"Only that your brother should come here. If I were you I should not
  mention the subject to Lady Amory again, but try to arrange matters in such a
  way that your brother can see her by accident, as it were. I am sorry this
  secrecy is necessary, but you know the necessity for caution."</p>

  <p>Vera sighed deeply. She was looking very pale and miserable. "Quite," she
  said. "How good and kind of you to take all this trouble. There was worry
  enough without this folly on Dick's part. I used to think that Oversands was
  the happiest house in England, but now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Words failed her for a while. She turned her head away, and when she
  looked at Ronald again her blue eyes were full of tears. "I daresay you
  wonder why I speak like this," she resumed. "I suppose no girl in my position
  has fewer friends than I have. I have always been perfectly happy looking
  after the house and the servants and attending to my garden. At one time my
  father was my constant companion. Latterly that has all changed. My father
  cares for nothing, he sits in the library and broods. Of course, I know that
  Dick has caused him a deal of anxiety. But I am sure there is something
  else&mdash;some black and bitter trouble that my father is keeping from me.
  If I could only find out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vera paused; the tears were trembling like diamonds on her long lashes.
  She touched Ronald to the heart, but he could say nothing. Yet he was
  flattered, too, by her confidences, and possibly he could have told Vera the
  secret of her father's vexation. His own father had given him more than one
  hint as to that. Matters at the bank had not been flourishing for some time,
  and Sir Horace's speculations in building sites in Shoremouth had come too
  late. Ronald was aware that Oversands was mortgaged heavily, and he had a
  suspicion that the mortgage was in his father's hands. Joseph Bastable, in
  his boasting way, had never actually said so, but he had dropped more than
  one suggestion to this effect. He knew also that his father had a big scheme
  in his mind, and that Sir Horace barred the way. If he continued to do so,
  then it would be hard upon him before very long.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear you say this," Ronald murmured.</p>

  <p>Vera smiled bravely, through her tears. "I ought not to say it," she
  replied. "Only it seems so natural to confide in you. I did so when a child,
  and though we have grown up, I feel just the same. I am not given to change,
  Ronald."</p>

  <p>The old name dropped from her lips naturally. Ronald felt his heart
  beating faster. It had been a dream of his that some day he might be rich and
  famous and make Vera Amory his wife. He had never forgotten this ambition of
  his. The vision of fame had vanished, but he would be rich some day, and in
  point of education he was the equal of the girl by his side.</p>

  <p>But would Sir Horace take the same view? In his mind Ronald would still be
  the son of his old servant, Joseph Bastable, the man who used to touch his
  hat to his master and called him "Sir." And there were people who said that
  Joseph Bastable had not been altogether honest in his dealing with his
  employer. The truth would probably never be known, but the fact remained that
  the man was now in a position to dictate terms to the old master. In Ronald's
  eyes this was a drawback. He wanted nothing of that sort; if he was to follow
  the desire of his heart, he would do it in his own way. That desire possessed
  him now with more than its old force.</p>

  <p>"I will do what I can for you," he said. "You know that you can rely upon
  me. The one thing that we have to think about is Dick's safety. It is
  possible that he may not be called upon to find this money at once. I mean
  that he need not do so unless it is voluntarily. Taking it for granted that
  Dick is an honest man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bastable, can we take that for granted?"</p>

  <p>Ronald evaded the point. There was no occasion to go into that now.</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall see," he said. "Dick thinks that Lady Amory will help him,
  and I fancy that you are of the same opinion. I'll tell him exactly what has
  happened, and he must try to come here on the chance of an interview with
  your aunt."</p>

  <p>It was growing towards dusk before Ronald found time to go to the Red
  House. Save for Vera's sake he would have wished himself well out of his
  task. It was difficult to smuggle food and drink to the Red House without
  attracting undue attention. Fortunately the loneliness of the spot rendered
  it easy to guard against surprises. Amory was sitting moodily in the
  dining-room smoking cigarettes and reading a sporting paper.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've taken your time," was his greeting. "I expected you hours
  ago. You don't know what it means to be all alone like this."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, it is not so simple as you imagine," Ronald retorted.
  "The mere getting food to you is in itself a problem. Personally, I think you
  are foolish to shut yourself up. It would be safe to go out in the daytime.
  You can see anybody coming miles off, and there are plenty of sandhills
  covered with long grass where you could hide, if necessary. Come out
  now."</p>

  <p>"All right," Dick said; "a brisk walk for a mile or so before dark will do
  me good. This place gets on my nerves. All the time I am expecting somebody
  to knock at the door and ask for admission. I can almost see the detectives
  who are after me. Now tell me what you have done."</p>

  <p>"So far, very little. I had a long chat with your sister to-day, and she
  told Lady Amory you wanted to see her. It was impossible to make the poor
  lady understand. She was under the impression that some harm had come to you.
  It will be necessary for you to see her personally. You had better go as far
  as the house to-morrow night after ten o'clock and hang about until your
  sister is ready for you. When all is safe she will give you the signal and
  smuggle you into the house. But mind, you are to play the game, Amory. If
  Lady Amory helps you, the money must be devoted to the people who have
  suffered by your folly."</p>

  <p>"What else do I need it for?" Amory asked, sulkily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; it isn't for me to say. But I am pretty well acquainted
  with your character, my dear fellow, and you are not likely to do an act of
  justice voluntarily. Still, there is no occasion for us to discuss this. I'll
  come and see you to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Ronald turned on his heel and made his way back to Shoremouth. Amory had
  accompanied him further than he had intended, so that he had a mile or more
  between him and the Red House. There was not the remotest chance of
  encountering anybody on the way, but the place played on his unstrung nerves.
  He imagined every heap of sand and tuft of grass concealed a foe, that the
  waving rushes were so many detectives ready to pounce upon him.</p>

  <p>He was trembling and tingling from head to foot by the time he reached the
  Red House. It was bad enough to be indoors, in all conscience, but it was
  worse to be outside. He would be glad to shut the door behind him and shoot
  the bolt. The door was open as he came up to the house, and this caused a
  pang of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Funny," he muttered. "I could have sworn that I closed it after Bastable.
  I suppose I must have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>He pulled the heavy dusty stiff curtain across the window, and lighted two
  of the candles with which Bastable had provided him. Then from a worn and
  battered oak chest he produced a bottle of whisky and a glass. He helped
  himself liberally to the spirit, and the colour crept into his pale
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>So far he was safe. It was absurd to suppose that anybody would look for
  him here. The whisky was doing its work, and he was growing easier in mind.
  Nobody ever came near the Red House at this time of night, for the thick
  curtains shut out all light from the candles. Upstairs, Amory had made
  himself a bed, but he was not feeling like sleep yet.</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket for his matches and cigarettes, but found
  none&mdash;he had probably dropped them. A box stood on the mantelshelf, and
  Amory reached it. The pattern was unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"Now, where did these come from?" he muttered. "Common sulphur matches
  such as one sees on the Continent. I'll swear I never had any like them."</p>

  <p>It was certainly strange. As Amory glanced round the room his eye fell
  upon five of the sulphur matches arranged in a rough, careless pattern on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Five matches!" he exclaimed. "Two bent, and one split in two, and the
  whole forming the sign of a dagger. What, in the name of heaven, does this
  mean?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Amory stared at the symbol with a fluttering at his
  heart. Beyond question those matches were not on the table when he had
  quitted the house with Bastable an hour or so before. He could not have
  arranged them mechanically in that odd fashion without remembering the fact.
  Besides, he had no such matches in his possession; he had not seen a sulphur
  match for years. So far as he knew, they were extinct in this country. He had
  seen such things in France, where the Government have a monopoly of the match
  industry, but not in England. The box lay on the mantelpiece, and had
  evidently been forgotten by the owner, who must have been here a little time
  before.</p>

  <p>Possibly he was in the house at that moment. The mere suggestion of such a
  thing sent a creeping sensation up Amory's spine and set his scalp quivering.
  He would have to go upstairs and make a search. The whisky gave him fleeting
  courage. He must find out whether he was alone or not. If those matches
  represented some hidden sign, if they had some subtle menace, it certainly
  was not for him. He had never had anything to do with secret societies,
  though he had read of their doings in the papers. It suddenly flashed across
  his mind that other people besides himself might be making use of the Red
  House. It was the sort of place that desperate characters might use. Perhaps
  these people had been away upon some expedition; perhaps the matches were a
  message to somebody who might be expected back at any moment.</p>

  <p>It was not a soothing suggestion, and Amory helped himself to more whisky.
  He hid his glass and bottle carefully again. If any visitor, should come it
  would be as well he should see nothing of his store of spirits.</p>

  <p>Forcing himself to take action, he proceeded to search the house. He
  passed carefully from room to room, disturbing the dust on old furniture, but
  beyond a mouse or two and a big red-eyed rat he could detect no sign of a
  living thing. Somewhat easier in his mind, he replaced his candle on the
  table and glanced about him. The five matches forming the rude semblance of a
  dagger were still there, but no longer alone!</p>

  <p>Dick gasped in astonishment. Instead of one sign, there were now three.
  They were laid out neatly side by side, looking just as innocent as if they
  had been the work of a child trying some simple puzzle with the little
  splinters of wood. But they drove the blood from Dick Amory's heart and left
  him helpless and terrified.</p>

  <p>"I'm mad!" he murmured. "I've gone mad! Those matches exist only in my
  imagination. I shall come to my senses presently and laugh at myself."</p>

  <p>But the matches were real enough. Amory pinched himself vigorously. He
  could feel the pain of it tingling up and down his leg. The fascination held
  him for a minute longer, till the sound of a footstep outside fell like a
  pistol-shot on his ear. The spell was broken. He jumped back into the passage
  and crouched almost breathless with fear behind an old oak chest. In a
  fashion almost mechanical he had blown out his candles and placed them over
  the fireplace. Beyond a doubt the police were on his track at last!</p>

  <p>The needle-like rays of an electric torch flashed across the passage.
  Raising his head, Dick made out the figures of two men. One of them at least
  did not suggest the detective as he is pictured in popular imagination. He
  was rather tall and slim, wore a dark, military-looking moustache, fiercely
  twisted at the ends, and in his eye was a single glass. His companion had a
  face covered in hair, and his eyes were concealed by blue spectacles. Amory
  was conscious of a feeling of relief. There would be no necessity for the
  officers of the law to assume a disguise if they were after him in earnest,
  and there was no disguise about these intruders as far as he could see. The
  tall man was a foreigner, his companion English beyond doubt. There was
  something oddly familiar in his figure; Amory thought he had seen the little
  man before.</p>

  <p>"Evidently designed by a fortunate chance for our special benefit," the
  tall man said. "On the brave and clever fate always bestows her smiles, my
  dear fellow. Now, here is a house where we shall never be disturbed. The
  curious tourist will give it a wide berth; no tramp or vendor of cheap
  sewing-machines will ever intrude upon our privacy. We shall be able to get
  it at our own price; indeed, Sir Horace will be only too glad to secure a
  tenant. Let us explore further."</p>

  <p>The electric torch was turned away and the intruders vanished into the
  dining-room. The gay tones of the tall man came distinctly to Amory's
  ears.</p>

  <p>"You will observe, my friend, that the house is partially furnished. Here
  are old things that some people would value highly; also behold a pair of
  candlesticks with half-consumed candles in them&mdash;to say nothing of a box
  of matches. They appear to be matches of a date singularly appropriate to the
  character of the house. Let us light them and look about us, my comrade. It
  was a fortunate chance that we found the back door open."</p>

  <p>The listener cursed his carelessness under his breath.</p>

  <p>"A pair of drawn curtains keeps the light from shining over the
  sandhills," the speaker proceeded, gaily. "Somebody has been smoking
  cigarettes within recent memory. Possibly Sir Horace Amory calls occasionally
  to inspect his property. Will you be so good as to place the candles on the
  table, and&mdash;by the powers, what is this?"</p>

  <p>The last words rose almost to a scream; anger, fear, hate, and fury were
  strongly mingled. In spite of the risk he ran, Amory crept along the passage
  and looked into the dining-room. The candles were burning brightly on the
  table, and the tall stranger stood with his hand pressed to his forehead. His
  hat had fallen to the ground, and the look in his eyes fairly fascinated the
  watcher. The whole gamut of evil emotions chased one another rapidly across
  that pale and malignant face.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the matter?" the smaller man asked.</p>

  <p>"Look at this," the other said, in a hissing whisper. "Look at this on the
  table. To you they convey nothing&mdash;to you they are so many matches laid
  out by somebody who has been trying one of those silly puzzles invented for
  the amusement of fools. Would to Heaven they were! So there are three of them
  upon my track! I thought I had tricked them nicely; I was idiot enough to
  imagine I had done with them for ever. And all the time they have been close
  on my heels, all the time are watching my every movement. They even knew that
  I was coming here to-night. Why, I didn't know myself till an hour ago; I
  told nobody but you, and you have not been out of my presence since."</p>

  <p>"What are you muttering about?" the little man asked.</p>

  <p>The foreigner pulled himself together and smiled. All the same, his face
  was twitching, as Amory could see as he stood in the shadow of the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"No matter," he said. "I'll tell you presently. You know what it is to be
  afraid of the police! Ah, my friend, there are worse things in the world than
  police. You don't know what it is to be possessed by devils as I am. That the
  fault is my own makes it all the worse. Still, it is only a warning, and I am
  safe for to-night, at any rate. Now, let us sit down, and consider our
  position. We are here to solve the secret of the sands. As a man who was born
  and bred here, you have the whole legend by heart."</p>

  <p>"It is no legend," the little man said.</p>

  <p>"So much the better. The thing is true, and we have to solve it. Not very
  far from us, and buried in the quicksands, lies one hundred thousand pounds,
  or its equivalent. With my scientific and your local knowledge it is going to
  be our business to get hold of that treasure. That it belongs to somebody
  else gives it greater zest in my eyes. But like most remunerative
  enterprises, this one requires money. We have no money, my dear fellow. At
  the moment I don't know where to turn for the cash to pay our hotel bill
  yonder at the end of the week. It is necessary that our credit should keep
  good. When we come to take this place we shall be asked for references. I
  have none. Why! we got into the club here by using the name of a man who dare
  not show his face in England, though nobody knows it but ourselves and the
  police. When we are asked for references, my idea is to pay a year's rent in
  advance."</p>

  <p>"Only you don't happen to possess it," the little man sneered.</p>

  <p>Amory, listening there, was racking his brain to discover where he had
  heard that voice before. The thing eluded him in the most irritating way. The
  face conveyed nothing to him, though the man had been bred and born in the
  neighbourhood of Shoremouth.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the foreigner admitted, gaily. "We are penniless. But we
  shall be in funds before long if you show a little courage. Now I have done
  you a good turn. I have baffled the police for you; I have made your position
  safe for some time to come. During the few days I spent here before you came
  I made several inquiries. I have been exploring the neighbourhood for likely
  spots to try my flying-machine&mdash;when it is made. Occasionally, I have
  trespassed on private property, and been reminded of the fact. I have then
  apologised in my most charming manner and withdrawn. But I have used my eyes,
  and I have learnt many useful facts. For instance, I have learned that in
  this locality there are some ten thousand pounds' worth of jewels to be had
  for the asking almost. They lie snugly to hand in the drawer of a
  dressing-table. The dressing-room window is only a few feet from the ground,
  and there is strong ivy all round it. The catch of the window is a common one
  that can be pushed back with a knife. Now what I do you say to that, my dear
  young friend?"</p>

  <p>The little man murmured something that sounded like approbation.</p>

  <p>"Well, they are ready for us whenever we like. But the woman, lovely
  woman, is as capricious as she is beautiful, and has a charming habit of
  changing her mind. She might suddenly take it into her head that the jewels
  are not safe."</p>

  <p>"She might," the little man said. "To-morrow night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, my faithful friend and follower, not to-morrow night, but now. I
  didn't tell you before, because you might have funked it at the last moment.
  We are going almost at once, and I shall run up to London and get rid of the
  plunder. By this time to-morrow we shall be rolling in money. Kindly blow
  those candles out and follow me. All you have to do is to follow your
  instructions&mdash;there is not the slightest danger. Come on."</p>

  <p>The lights were extinguished, the door closed behind the conspirators, and
  Amory was alone again. He was still puzzling over the mystery of the little
  man, and where he had heard that voice before. He was glad to be alone, glad
  to have the house to himself.</p>

  <p>"Now, I wonder who these fellows are?" he muttered. "I wonder where they
  are going and where they are likely to find all those jewels ready to their
  hand. I know of nobody within dozen miles who would be so silly
  as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He jumped to his feet with a start. It all came with a staggering
  flash.</p>

  <p>"Lady Amory's diamonds!" he cried aloud. "The gems that were to get me out
  of this infernal scrape! But any risk, any hazard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He jammed his hat on his head, and flung open the door. Then, heedless of
  personal danger, he ran across the sandhills towards his father's house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE town of Shoremouth, is a curious mixture of the old and
  the new. Originally it had been a fishing village, until local enterprise had
  found an opening for capital in the shape of rope-works. The more ancient
  part the town consists of shops with gabled roofs and half-timbered fronts;
  in fact, the High-street is quite Elizabethan. There are gaps between the
  houses here and there, faced by high walls, and behind them some good houses
  devoted to the use of the professional classes.</p>

  <p>The new town is altogether different. It is modern and up-to-date, and
  boasts of shops of the newest pattern. Most of the streets lead to the parade
  and the pier, or to large open squares where the boarding-houses are
  situated. And it mostly all belonged to Mr. Joseph Bastable.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Joseph Bastable was the most important man in the
  place. Fourteen years ago nobody thought anything of him. As to that,
  fourteen years ago the new town had been no better than a ridge of sandhills
  where now streets of houses stood. To all practical purposes, Bastable had
  made Shoremouth. He had a hand in everything. He owned the houses, and in
  many cases the furniture in them also. He was even nominal manager of the
  Great Northern Bank, the concern which had had so much to do with the falling
  fortunes of the house or Amory. Nobody knew how far the ramifications of Mr.
  Bastable went; you never knew where you might run up against him.</p>

  <p>As to Mrs. Bastable, she was superior to her husband in every respect. She
  had been an Amory at one time, dependent upon the bounty of Sir Horace, but
  her marriage to Joseph Bastable had caused mortal offence to the family. It
  was the beginning of the feud between Sir Horace and Joseph Bastable that was
  going to ruin the baronet.</p>

  <p>Bastable was a big man, with a big manner and a big voice. He made his
  presence felt wherever he was, was proud of his success, and intolerant of
  the opinion of others. He had made few mistakes in his life, which, perhaps,
  accounted for his conceit. He was hard, grasping, and unscrupulous. He had
  realised most of his ambitions. The first and greatest was to see Sir Horace
  trampled in the dust. Also he was desirous of providing Shoremouth with a
  golf links that should become famous. Not that he knew one end of a golf-club
  from another. But the prosperity of Shoremouth was like the breath of life to
  him, and he realised what a good course meant to a seaside resort. One
  obstacle blocked his plans. The stretch of land where those famous links were
  to be laid down was in the possession of Sir Horace, who had point-blank
  refused to part with it to his enemy. It was worthless land on the far side
  of the river, opposite the Red House, and Sir Horace's obstinacy might fairly
  be attributed to dislike and detestation of Joseph Bastable.</p>

  <p>Bastable came home to dinner in an unusually gracious mood. He was loud
  and assertive as usual, but, for him, almost genial. Preoccupied though
  Ronald was with gloomy thoughts, he did not fail to observe this. The cloth
  was removed presently and the decanters were placed on the polished mahogany.
  This was the one bit of ceremonial that Bastable was fond of. It suggested
  solid prosperity and well-earned importance. Bastable positively beamed on
  his family as he lighted a big black cigar.</p>

  <p>"Take one, my boy," he said, expansively. "You'll never do any good in the
  world so long as you stick to those wretched cigarettes. I've got some news
  for you. Kennedy is dead."</p>

  <p>"John Kennedy?" Mrs. Bastable asked. "I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes; he'll be a loss to Shoremouth," Bastable went on. "He made a
  bit of money here in the old days, and he knew how to take care of it. One
  way and another, I should say that John Kennedy is worth half a million."</p>

  <p>"I hope he has thought of his poor relations," Mrs. Bastable murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not he. Kennedy was no fool. He never gave me a hint as to what he was
  going to do. But I am one of the executors; I shall know soon."</p>

  <p>"What was the matter with him?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the ordinary way," Bastable explained. "Whole thing was an
  accident. Kennedy was in Switzerland looking after some timber land he had
  bought, when an avalanche swept down and buried the whole party. They were
  carried over a cliff some hundreds of feet high, and none of them will ever
  be seen again. They tell me it is impossible to recover the bodies. It is all
  in the evening papers. I should like to see old Amory's face when he gets the
  news."</p>

  <p>"What has Sir Horace to do with it?" Ronald asked. "They were pretty good
  friends."</p>

  <p>"They did a lot of business together, if that is what you mean, my boy. I
  happen to know that Kennedy helped Amory out of a good many tight places. He
  had to pay for the accommodation, but it was mighty useful at the time. Our
  bank holds a promissory note at the present moment due from Amory to Kennedy
  for twenty thousand pounds. It has been renewed a good many times, but that
  won't happen again."</p>

  <p>"You mean that Sir Horace will have to pay?" Mrs. Bastable asked.</p>

  <p>Bastable chuckled as he helped himself to another glass of port. "That's
  about the size of it, my dear," he said, with great good humour. "As
  executor, it will be my duty to call in all the money due to Kennedy's
  estate. In eight days Amory will be asked to take up the note, and if he
  fails&mdash;well, so much the worse for him. I happen to know that he hasn't
  got the cash."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bastable looked anxious. She had no head nor liking for business, but
  it was impossible to live in the same atmosphere as Joseph Bastable without
  learning something of the ways of the money-spinner.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to use this as a weapon, Joseph?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Bastable demanded. "I should be a born idiot if I threw away a
  chance like this! I am going to bring that chap's nose to the grindstone. He
  shall come to me on his knees asking favours. Look how he has treated me over
  those golf links! And he professes to have the prosperity of the place at
  heart. He wants money badly, and yet he won't part with that land of his
  across the river. It is of no use to him, whereas I could make a fortune out
  of it. Now he will have to sell, and at my price this time."</p>

  <p>"Then you will not renew that note?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"Renew the note! Bless my soul, what is the boy talking about! Directly it
  becomes due, Amory will be asked for the money. He will demand time and an
  extension, and my answer will be a writ. It will smash him up; he will have
  to sell Oversands, and when that comes into the market I shall buy it and
  live there. That has been a dream of mine for years. I'm going to be known as
  Joseph Bastable, Oversands, and don't you forget it. If Amory behaves himself
  I'll give him a post in our bank. And you shall marry his girl, Ronald. Sir
  Horace will be only too glad to have you for a son-in-law. That's what's
  going to happen!"</p>

  <p>Ronald writhed uneasily in his chair. This rude hand on the tender spot
  hurt exceedingly. He wondered if his father had guessed his secret, or if he
  were merely expressing his own wishes.</p>

  <p>"Please don't jest about it," he said. "If I had ambitions in that
  quarter, and your remarks came to Miss Amory's ears, my chance would be gone
  forever."</p>

  <p>"Not if she was a pauper, my boy. She looks down upon us now, but she
  won't then. You'll be a good catch one of these days. Still, I don't insist
  upon it."</p>

  <p>"You are very good," Ronald said, drily. "But you'll give Sir Horace
  notice?"</p>

  <p>"Not a day, not an hour," Bastable said, with a click of his lips. "I mean
  business if ever man meant it. Nine o'clock, is it? I must go; got a meeting
  of the Goldnay trustees."</p>

  <p>Bastable finished his port and departed abruptly. Mrs. Bastable gathered
  up her skirts and retired to the drawing-room. But this evening she did not
  take up her knitting as usual. She sat with her hands in her lap, looking
  into the fire. Ronald was equally thoughtful over his cigarette, which was
  permitted in that sacred apartment after dinner.</p>

  <p>"Ronny," Mrs. Bastable said suddenly&mdash;"Ronny, this must be
  stopped!"</p>

  <p>Ronald started. He could never recollect hearing his mother talk like this
  before. Apart from the domestic side she was a mere cypher in the household.
  Such a thing as a difference of opinion with her husband was unheard of.</p>

  <p>"I'm of your opinion," Ronald said, moodily. "It isn't just on my father's
  part; I'll go further, and say that it isn't honest. Sir Horace ought to know
  at once that this note of his will not be renewed. He should have a fair
  chance to turn round and find the money."</p>

  <p>"Would it be loyal," Mrs. Bastable whispered, "if you were
  to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She let the sentence remain unfinished; she glanced half-guiltily at her
  son.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of that," Ronald said. He glanced at the clock. It still
  wanted twenty minutes to ten. He moved towards the door, a sudden resolution
  uppermost in his mind.</p>

  <p>"I'll go now," he said. "I may be doing wrong, but surely this is a case
  where the end justifies the means."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Horace was alone in his library. He sat before a table,
  turning over a mass of papers, the sight of which produced a profound
  melancholy. Like most easy-going men, he had a natural dislike to looking his
  liabilities squarely in the face. He was making an effort to do so now, and
  the situation appalled him. How had he got into this mess? How could he have
  drifted so far without realising the serious state of affairs?</p>

  <p>The great trouble, of course, was the promissory note to Kennedy, due in a
  few days. Kennedy was always willing to renew, but would he do so again?
  Besides, he was away, and not likely to be back for some time to come. Sir
  Horace was not aware that the note had been deposited with Mr. Kennedy's
  bankers. Well, the thing must stand over till the old man came home.</p>

  <p>The promissory note was probably in his safe. One or two speculations
  might prove successful, and then the note could be taken up. The sanguine
  side of the man's nature was cropping up again. He smiled almost amiably as a
  footman entered.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ronald Bastable to see you, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Really. At this time of night. Give my compliments to Mr. Bastable,
  Gregory, say that I am engaged. Ask him to call at the bank in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Beg, pardon, Sir Horace," the footman stammered, "but he says it's urgent
  business."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace made a gesture of impatience. A moment later and Ronald came
  into the library. He looked a fine, handsome figure. Really, the fellow was
  very presentable, Sir Horace admitted magnanimously. He appeared quite at
  home there, his manner easy and natural. Besides, on his mother's side he was
  an Amory.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, my dear fellow, sit down," Sir Horace said, cordially. "It's
  rather strange that I should see you under my roof twice in so short a time.
  You came on business, my servant tells me. Would it not have kept till the
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"I think not, Sir Horace," Ronald replied. "It is something that you ought
  to know without the slightest delay. Mr. Kennedy is dead."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" Sir Horace cried. "What a calamity!"</p>

  <p>He was enough of a business man to see the ominous result of the
  catastrophe. There could be no question of getting the note renewed now. He
  paced up and down the room in an agitated manner.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly tell me all about it?" he said.</p>

  <p>Ronald proceeded to do so. Sir Horace appeared to be listening vaguely.
  With an effort he concentrated his attention on what Ronald was saying.</p>

  <p>"This news means much to me," he said. "But how did you guess it? How did
  you come to know that this unhappy accident affected my fortunes? For you do
  know that, or you would not be here to-night."</p>

  <p>"I got it from my father," Ronald explained. "He is one of Mr. Kennedy's
  executors. He will have the administration of the estate in his hands. I want
  to be plain and honest with you, Sir Horace. To a certain extent I am
  betraying confidence, but I fancy that I am justified in so doing. There is
  an acceptance from you to Mr. Kennedy for a large amount due in eight days.
  The note will not be renewed, you will be required to pay it off or take it
  up, as you call it. I didn't want this to come as an unpleasant surprise to
  you at the last moment, and that is why I am here to-night. You can see for
  yourself that it is no pleasant task I have taken in hand. It makes me feel a
  trifle mean and dishonourable, but I have weighed one thing with another,
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not another word, my boy," Sir Horace said, huskily. "I appreciate the
  delicacy of the position, and from the bottom of my heart I thank you. Your
  action has been only what I should have expected from one who has the Amory
  blood in his veins. Your father and myself have been enemies for years, and I
  suppose I cannot blame him for making use of the weapon that Fate has placed
  in his hands. Still, I shall have time to turn round and look about me. If
  the worst comes to the worst, I daresay I shall be able to compromise over
  that land on the far side of the river."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace held out his hand as if to terminate the interview. The blow
  had shaken him more than he cared to acknowledge; he wanted to be alone to
  grapple with the truth. The thing was as plain to Ronald as if Sir Horace had
  said so in as many words.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said. "I'm glad I came. Please don't trouble to ring the
  bell&mdash;I can let myself out easily."</p>

  <p>It was doubtful whether Sir Horace heard or not. He had probably forgotten
  all about Ronald's existence. As the door closed he dropped heavily into his
  chair and covered his face with his hands. There was something almost
  murderous in this unexpected stroke of fortune. He was delivered, chained and
  bound, into the hands of his bitterest foe. It would be utterly futile to
  expect mercy from Joseph Bastable. Why, the man would actually have paid a
  large sum of his beloved money for a chance like this.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly plain what he was going to do. Directly Sir Horace made
  default in payment of the advance, he would take legal proceedings&mdash;the
  whole thing would come out, and the credit of Amory's Bank be destroyed for
  ever. At any cost the claim must be met; and so far as Sir Horace could see,
  this was out of the question.</p>

  <p>Ronald crossed the big hall with its armour and old oak and pictures
  gleaming under the soft glow of the shaded lamps. There was nothing to
  suggest poverty or trouble of any kind. The drawing-room door was open, and
  Ronald could see Vera there. At a little table Lady Amory sat, apparently
  absorbed in some trivial game. He paused for a moment, and Vera came out.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" she asked. "Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Not so far as your brother is concerned," Ronald replied. "I came to give
  Sir Horace some business information that was pressing."</p>

  <p>"Then you have nothing to tell me about Dick?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing fresh. I think he is fairly safe for the moment. He is
  anxiously waiting for the chance of an interview with Lady Amory."</p>

  <p>Vera shook her head sorrowfully. "I am afraid that is impossible just
  now," she said. "My aunt is in a worse mental condition than usual. I cannot
  get her to understand anything. She is in the mood when the most trivial
  things amuse her. She has a new game. It is played with a box of matches, and
  is really most ridiculous. Come and speak to her."</p>

  <p>Ronald followed his companion into the drawing-room. Lady Amory sat at a
  little card-table with a box of matches before her. She had divided them into
  groups of fives, and had so arranged them by bending and breaking them that
  they presented a rude resemblance to so many daggers. Though Ronald did not
  know it as yet, it was the very formation that had so startled Dick Amory in
  the Red House half an hour or so ago.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Lady Amory," Ronald said. "Won't you teach me the
  game?"</p>

  <p>A sadden shrill laugh broke from the player's lips. Her eyes gleamed
  strangely.</p>

  <p>"Teach you to play, the deadliest game in the world! But you know nothing
  of that; it conveys little to you. Look here, boy! That one at the top is the
  chief. These others are his satellites. Once he gives the word, the traitor
  is doomed. There is no escape for him wherever he goes. It may be days, it
  may be years, but it comes all the same. And it always falls when least
  expected!"</p>

  <p>The words trailed off in a broken whisper. It seemed hopeless to expect
  any intelligent talk. Ronald mentioned Dick's name.</p>

  <p>"Dick is a good boy," the player said, without looking up from the table.
  "He is a good boy, and one day he will have all my money. But you need not
  pretend that he is anywhere here, because he always writes to me before he
  comes. You are his enemies. I can see that both of you hate him."</p>

  <p>Ronald tried again, but Lady Amory stubbornly refused to say more. Her
  frame of mind changed to one of open hostility and dislike. Ronald turned
  away and walked to the door. Vera followed him into the hall.</p>

  <p>"You see that it is useless," she said. "I can do nothing. We can only
  wait as patiently as we can for a change in her mood. My father is dining out
  on Friday, and I should say that that would be our opportunity. Dick can come
  round about 10 o'clock, and I will contrive to smuggle him into the
  house."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we had better arrange for that," Ronald said. "But will things
  be any better when Dick sees his aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Much better; I am sure of that," Vera replied. "Dick always has an
  extraordinary effect on her. She is a different creature in his presence. How
  considerate of you to take all this trouble for us. I don't know how to thank
  you."</p>

  <p>She held out her hands impulsively. Ronald caught them in his own.</p>

  <p>"Don't call it a trouble," he murmured. "Don't you know that I would do
  anything for you, Vera? I have never forgotten the old days. There was a gulf
  between us then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There never was," Vera smiled. "At least, not in my eyes. Don't forget
  that on your mother's side you are an Amory. I must come and see your mother.
  I know that your father and mine are at dagger's drawn, but I care nothing
  for that. Tell Mrs. Bastable that I am going to call one of these days.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>Vera looked up almost shyly as she spoke. There was something in her eyes
  that was more than friendliness; they said more than Vera intended, more than
  she guessed herself. Ronald thrilled as those little hands rested in his for
  a brief moment. He walked away from the house with a feeling of exultation
  that he would have found it hard to explain. He passed into the drive with
  the great beeches on either hand; it seemed to him that he could see a figure
  in the gloom to the left. There were footsteps on the gravel.</p>

  <p>Then another figure loomed out from a patch of laurels and confronted
  Ronald. He hesitated for a moment before he gripped the intruder by the
  throat. A gurgle of protest followed. The voice was familiar. Ronald smiled
  as he recognised Dick in the dim light.</p>

  <p>"You had a narrow escape," he said. "I thought you meant to attack me, and
  I was ready to give you a warm reception. What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Following two burglars," Dick explained. "I overheard the robbery planned
  in the Red House. There are two of them, and their idea is to rent the Red
  House from my father. As far as I could make out they are a couple of
  precious rascals. They are staying at the Grand, and have managed to get the
  entre of the club."</p>

  <p>Ronald gave a low whistle of astonishment. "I know them," he said. "One is
  a foreigner with a big black moustache and an eyeglass; the other is a little
  stout chap with a beard. They were in the club last night. I didn't much
  fancy the look of them. What are they going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they are going to get something to turn into money to start with.
  You see, it was impossible for me to give the alarm. I did not care to show
  my face anywhere, and so I had to let them go. The tall man had found a place
  where it was easy to steal a lot of jewels. He described the place, and I was
  fool enough not to understand what he was alluding to until after they'd
  started on their expedition. Then it flashed across my mind that it was Lady
  Amory's jewels they were after. There was no mistaking what the big man
  meant. I followed on the half-chance of giving the alarm and frightening the
  rascals away."</p>

  <p>Ronald remembered the two figures he had seen on the side of the drive a
  minute or two ago. Undoubtedly they were the thieves. His blood began to glow
  with the anticipation of adventure.</p>

  <p>"It was lucky I met you," Dick said.</p>

  <p>"You're right," Ronald replied. "Let's talk the matter over. Those fellows
  can do nothing for the next hour or so, and we can work out our plan of
  campaign meanwhile. With a little fortune, we'll bag the pair of them. You
  need not show up&mdash;I can do all the talking when the time for explanation
  arrives."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">For a long time Sir Horace had understood that matters were
  not going well with him. By slow degrees the other banks in the town had been
  weaning his best customers from him. Occasionally he had to decline
  remunerative business from sheer lack of funds. He was not the kind of man to
  ask favours, or he might perhaps have shared these good things with his
  London agents. He had a great idea, too, of standing well with his
  fellow-tradesmen. It was pleasant to walk about the place and be saluted
  respectfully by the people. The baronet was, moreover, kind-hearted&mdash;he
  could never listen unmoved to a tale of distress; he never pressed a man by
  any chance. There were some assets of the bank that the auditors would fain
  have written off. But Sir Horace had a weakness to regard them as money. When
  he felt anxious it afforded him a certain relief to put these sums to his
  credit.</p>

  <p>Of course, he would pull round some day. Sooner or later things must take
  a turn for the better. Kennedy's loan would not be always round his neck. A
  cruel stroke of luck like this he had never anticipated for a moment. There
  was a touch of the malignant about the way in which fate had played into the
  hands of his enemy.</p>

  <p>Yes, everything was clear now. No longer was he blinded by the sense of
  his own importance. He would not be called Sir Horace Amory of Oversands much
  longer. Within a week the story would be all over the place, and Amory and
  Sons a thing of the past. It was a frightful prospect. Yet, now that it had
  to be contemplated, Sir Horace, to his astonishment, was calm and collected.
  He did not seem to mind in the least; he was almost looking forward to the
  peace and happiness which would come when he had stripped himself of
  everything and retired to some little cottage.</p>

  <p>He went out into the hall presently and called to Vera. As he did so he
  saw Lady Amory making her way slowly up the stairs. Usually she retired much
  earlier. Sir Horace saw how the lights were sparkling on her jewels. Half
  that she possessed would set him free from all his troubles.</p>

  <p>Vera was not so full of trouble and misery herself that she failed to read
  the pain in her father's eyes. She had wondered why he had been so moody and
  preoccupied of late. Now she saw without being told. She knew that ruin had
  fallen on the house. A smile trembled on her lips.</p>

  <p>"I will come and talk to you, dear," she said. "You shall tell me all
  about it. I had no idea that things were so bad."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear child," Sir Horace protested. "Surely it is not quite
  so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, but it will be if you go into Shoremouth to-morrow with that anxious
  face. You are going to tell me that we are ruined. I shall be able to bear
  it."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace gave a sigh of relief. "Sit down by the fire," he said. "I want
  to have a long chat with you, Vera. We must try to-night to decide what is
  best to be done. We can't stay here."</p>

  <p>"You mean that we shall have to leave Oversands, father?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I shan't trouble to sell it, as the place is mortgaged to the hilt.
  I have had a good many misfortunes lately, Vera, and when I could stand it
  least I had Dick's debts to pay for the third time. Practically, it is Dick
  who has ruined us. I ought to have refused after the first time&mdash;I
  should have led those people clearly to understand that they need not look to
  me again. But pride, which has always been my curse, stood in the way. There
  are other things as well."</p>

  <p>"You have heard bad news to-night, father?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Young Bastable came and told me. It was very kind and thoughtful of
  him. I had not expected such delicacy in a Bastable."</p>

  <p>"Who is also an Amory. Don't forget that, dad."</p>

  <p>"Well, I daresay that accounts for it. A considerable time back I borrowed
  twenty thousand pounds from old Kennedy. That money I have never been able to
  pay back. I did not worry about it, because Kennedy has always renewed; in
  fact, he told me more than once that I should benefit by his death. He is
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Kennedy dead! We shall never see him again. Such a dear old man!"</p>

  <p>"And very fond of you, my child. Well, he is dead, and the management of
  his estate devolves upon Joseph Bastable. The twenty thousand pounds I spoke
  of falls due next week, and Bastable won't give me a day's grace. He will
  proceed against me, and the whole place will be talking. Can you see what it
  means?"</p>

  <p>Vera knew little of business, but she could see the size and weight of the
  weapon which circumstance had placed in Bastable's hands.</p>

  <p>"Father," she asked, "why does that man hate you so?"</p>

  <p>"Because he once did me a terrible injury," Sir Horace said, in a low
  voice. "I had always trusted Bastable. I always trust everybody, for that
  matter. He was entrusted by me with a large sum of money. There was a
  financial panic at the time, and my old friend Cartwright, at Smeaton, had
  asked for help. He was in sore need of fourteen thousand pounds in gold. I
  sent it to him by Bastable. It never reached its destination. Bastable
  elected to go by way of the quicksands&mdash;the tide was out, and he and my
  other messenger were going to cross the river by the stepping-stones.
  Bastable came back alone. His companion had slipped in the darkness and was
  never seen again. The gold had vanished with him. You know what the sands are
  like. Well, that was the story. It was a lie, Vera. I cannot prove it, but
  I'm sure that murder was done that night. From that moment Bastable began to
  grow insolent and indifferent to my interests. I discovered that he was
  making investments in Shoremouth&mdash;he who had not a penny! He knew
  perfectly well that I suspected him, for it was impossible for me to conceal
  my suspicions. I am telling you something now that I have kept to myself all
  these years. I need not say that this must not be mentioned to a soul. It is
  strange that the son of the man who did me this injury should warn me of my
  danger."</p>

  <p>"He is a gentleman, dad, and in a degree a relative."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not going to wait for Bastable to strike. I can dispose of my
  business to one of the banks; in fact, I have had a good many offers.
  Skepton, the stockbroker, will take Oversands off my hands as it stands. When
  everything comes to be settled up we shall have, perhaps, 300 a year to live
  on."</p>

  <p>"I shall not mind, father. We shall have nothing to be ashamed
  of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped, thinking suddenly of Dick. She rose from her chair, and
  crossed over to her father's side. Very tenderly she bent and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you have told me this," she said. "I am proud that you should
  confide in me. I won't worry in the least. Of course, it will be a terrible
  wrench to leave Oversands. I love the place where I was born; there is not an
  inch of ground that has not its pleasant recollections. But I daresay I shall
  be happy elsewhere, and the luck may turn."</p>

  <p>"It may," Sir Horace agreed. "I have one or two promising ventures on
  hand. Still, the time is very short, dear. If I could meet this claim of
  Kennedy's, things would be very different. I could amalgamate my business
  with one of the other concerns, and then we could go on."</p>

  <p>"We are talking nonsense," Vera smiled. "I'm going to bed. Mind, you are
  not to sit up half the night grieving over these things."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace promised due obedience. But half an hour later he was still
  sitting looking moodily into the fire. He came out of his reverie presently
  conscious that someone was moving about in the drawing-room. Nobody could
  have any legitimate business there at that hour.</p>

  <p>Lack of courage was not one of Sir Horace's failings. He strode off
  towards the drawing-room. One cluster of lights by the side of the fireplace
  was glowing. In the centre of the room was Lady Amory, apparently looking for
  something.</p>

  <p>She had not yet taken off the resplendent white dress she had worn at
  dinner. The dusky hair was still piled up on her head, and she shimmered with
  jewels.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking for?" Sir Horace asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory glanced up vaguely. She seemed to see nothing for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"My box of matches," she said. "I can do nothing without the matches, you
  know. If I haven't got them, I can't make the sign. When they see the sign
  they grow frightened and run away. I saw one of them yesterday in the
  road."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace expressed his sympathy. It was best to humour the poor lady
  when she had one of those dark moods upon her. Amory stooped and picked a box
  of matches from the floor from behind a Chippendale table. He handed it
  gravely to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Is that what you need?" he asked. "I hope you won't have any more trouble
  with that sign. Besides, nobody will worry you at this time of night."</p>

  <p>"They come at all hours and in all guises," the poor lady said. "They are
  the boldest people in the world. But they are afraid of the sign."</p>

  <p>She stood with her head drawn back in an attitude of rapt attention. She
  was listening to something Sir Horace could not hear, and made a striking
  picture with her white dress and flashing gems.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate to have all these, Maria," Amory said. He touched a
  five-pointed diamond star that blazed upon her breast. "It must be nice to
  walk about with a fortune on your dress. But at the same time it is foolish,
  not to say dangerous. Why don't you let me take care of these things for you?
  Let me put them away in my safe. You have only to ask me when you want to
  wear them."</p>

  <p>The woman drew back, with cold suspicion in her eyes. "No," she whispered,
  "they are safe with me. Only show the sign, and they dare not touch one of my
  beloved stones. They are all I have to care for."</p>

  <p>She fondled the stones almost affectionately. A sudden temptation gripped
  Amory. Here was an easy way out of his troubles. If only he had that diamond
  star he could defy Bastable to do the worst. He need not leave Oversands; he
  would retain the respect of his fellow-men, and hold his head as high as
  ever.</p>

  <p>"Give me one of these," he said, hoarsely. "Lend me one for a time. Maria,
  I am in great distress. Try to understand what I am saying to you. Unless I
  have money soon I shall have to go away from here. I shall have to dispose of
  the place and take a cottage. All the luxury and comfort you enjoy will be
  gone for ever. You can save me if you like."</p>

  <p>To a certain extent she did understand. Her eyes showed that. But there
  was no answering smile on her face, nothing but suspicion and alarm and fear.
  With a low cry she broke away from Amory's detaining hand and fled up the
  stairs. She locked the dressing-room door behind her, and proceeded hurriedly
  to remove a mass of jewels from the drawers of a table. These she thrust
  between the mattresses of her bed. She was trembling from head to foot as she
  did so.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she whispered, fiercely, "not that way. He would have robbed me
  if I had stayed with him longer. I can give them to nobody but Dick. If the
  others come in the night I must be prepared."</p>

  <p>She took up the box of matches and arranged the strange signs upon the
  dressing-table. Then, with a half-satisfied sigh, she retired to her
  bedroom.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">De Lava and Sexton lay snugly in a dry ditch by the side of
  the drive. It was safe to remain there for the present and smoke cigarettes.
  By peeping through the bushes they could command a good view of the house.
  They were waiting till all the lights should be out before beginning
  operations.</p>

  <p>Their patience was being tried. As a general rule the lights of Oversands
  were extinguished by eleven o'clock, but it was past twelve now, and the
  study window still glowed, as also did one or two of the bedrooms upstairs.
  De Lava fidgeted.</p>

  <p>"This waiting gets on my nerves," he said. "In action, my dear Sexton, I
  am the bravest of the brave. My courage would be a telling theme for poetry.
  Your Walter Scott would have revelled in a character like mine. But when I
  have to wait and wait, I am like a timid schoolgirl. That is the window on
  the left."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the one with the light in it?" Sexton asked.</p>

  <p>"The same, my friend. That is the dressing-room of our lady of the gems.
  Usually she seeks her blameless pillow at an early hour. She is, unhappily,
  of weak intellect; but that is rather a fortunate thing for us. Ah, the light
  is out!"</p>

  <p>Sexton shook in his shoes. Courage was not one of his strong points. He
  was new to this kind of thing, and from the bottom of his heart wished he was
  well out of it. Anything calling for cunning or rascality he would have met
  quite coolly; but there might be trouble here, and bloodshed as well. His
  teeth chattered.</p>

  <p>"It is good to have so stout a comrade," De Lava said. "But I implore you
  not to be violent, my dear fellow."</p>

  <p>"I'm not used to it," Sexton growled. "I can be cool enough in the face of
  some kinds of danger, as you know. I can face a judge and jury and lie myself
  clear out of the dock. That even you were afraid to do on a certain occasion.
  Besides, I am not frightened of a few lucifer matches on a table."</p>

  <p>The retort silenced De Lava for the moment, and he grew pale. "All right,"
  he said. "I'll not chaff you any more. There will be just time to smoke one
  cigarette, and then to business."</p>

  <p>The cigarette finished at length, De Lava rose to his feet. He pushed
  boldly across the grass until he stood under the window of the dressing-room.
  It was not far from the ground, and, the wall being covered with ivy of
  ancient growth, the task was an easy one.</p>

  <p>"The gems are in a drawer up yonder," De Lava whispered. "The thing is
  simpler than I had imagined. Why was I so generous as to let you come into
  this good thing. Why didn't I keep it to myself?"</p>

  <p>"Because I shall be useful later," Sexton muttered. "Generous! You! I am
  surprised that you can pronounce the word. You couldn't spell it."</p>

  <p>De Lava chuckled noiselessly. This humour appealed to him. "Give me the
  torch," he said, "and the knife. Wait here and keep your wits about you. If
  anybody comes in sight give a whistle. It's a soft job for you, my friend,
  and one that you will be well paid for. Honest, too, by comparison with some
  of your exploits."</p>

  <p>With this De Lava proceeded to climb up the ivy. He speedily reached the
  window and pushed back the catch with the thin blade of the knife. A moment
  later and the adventurer was in the room.</p>

  <p>He pressed his finger on the button of the torch and the tiny lance of
  brilliant flame shot out. Here was the dressing-table, and there the drawers
  where, so gossip said, the mad Lady Amory kept her gems. Gossip for once in a
  way was correct, and De Lava could not know that he had come a day after the
  fair. With growing impatience and muttered curses, he turned one drawer out
  after another. Finally everything in the table had been ransacked, but not a
  single gem was to be seen.</p>

  <p>With a furious oath De Lava flashed his light about the room. He replaced
  the cover on the dressing-table, which he had disarranged, and as he glanced
  down the curses died away on his bloodless lips.</p>

  <p>The five matches! The sign of the dagger! The sight petrified him for the
  moment. The white lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"Those fellows must be in league with the devil," he muttered. "They read
  my inmost thoughts; they know what I mean to do before I know myself. Now,
  this poltroon of a Sexton never heard of the gang. He did not know till just
  before we left the Red House that I meditated this expedition to-night.
  Therefore, he is playing no tricks upon me. Yet there are the
  signs&mdash;large, legible, menacing. The mere sight of them turns my blood
  to water."</p>

  <p>He was sweating from head to foot, leaning against the dressing-table for
  support. He was fighting desperately to regain control of himself. Gradually
  the colour crept back into his cheeks, and the trembling in his limbs ceased.
  After all, there could be no immediate danger, and the task of the evening
  was not yet done.</p>

  <p>The gems must be somewhere near. In all probability they were in Lady
  Amory's bedroom. This increased the risk, of course, but De Lava was not the
  man to retire at the first indication of failure. He slipped out of the room
  and joined his companion.</p>

  <p>Sexton sighed with positive relief. "We can be off now?" he asked. "There
  is nothing to wait for?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," De Lava said, drily, "there is a good deal to wait for.
  There are the diamonds, my dear sir."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say you haven't got them?" Sexton said, dismally.</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it," De Lava responded. "This doesn't appear to
  be our lucky day. The diamonds are not where I expected to find them. Our
  fair friend has taken it into her head to hide them elsewhere&mdash;probably
  in her bed room."</p>

  <p>"Then we had better return to our hotel," Sexton suggested.</p>

  <p>"Without money to pay the bill! My dear fellow, if you think I am going
  back now you have mistaken your man. An obstacle or two&mdash;bah! what' of
  that? On the contrary, I am more than ever resolved to have those stones. I
  will enter the lady's room. If she is asleep and I can get the diamonds
  without disturbing the sweet serenity of her slumbers, so much the better. If
  I don't find them I shall be under the painful necessity of awaking her. Ah,
  no; I will use no violence. Henri De Lava is too devoted a slave of the sex
  for that. Stay here, but keep your wits about you."</p>

  <p>Sexton groaned, while De Lava slipped through the window again quite
  gaily. With the electric torch in his hand he crept into Lady Amory's room.
  He was slightly dismayed to find that the electric light over the bed was
  still burning. Lady Amory, however, lay fast asleep, as her regular breathing
  testified. It promised to be an easy matter, after all.</p>

  <p>But the diamonds were not to be discovered. At the end of half an hour De
  Lava had searched everywhere to no purpose. His heart was hot with baffled
  fury and disappointment. His fingers crooked towards the bed. If the worst
  came to the worst, he would not hesitate to wake the sleeper and demand to
  know where the jewels were concealed.</p>

  <p>He was spared the trouble. He turned as an exclamation fell upon his ears.
  Lady Amory was sitting up in bed, a wild fury gleaming in her eyes. There was
  no suggestion of fear on her face. She sprang up and huddled herself into a
  wrap.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" she cried.</p>

  <p>De Lava stepped back amazed. "Maria!" he exclaimed. "Maria! There is some
  mistake. Lady Amory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Amory. Once more, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The words were cold and cutting. There was no mental weakness in the woman
  now. Her eyes were bold and resolute; she knew exactly what she was
  doing.</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Amory," she went on. "What you are is only known to heaven and
  your own foul mind. I am the last person in the world you wanted to see. The
  shock of meeting you has given me back my reason, for the time, at all
  events. To-morrow the cloud may fall again. Ah! I guess what you want. You
  have heard of Lady Amory's diamonds."</p>

  <p>De Lava bowed and smiled. "You have saved me the pain of introducing a
  disagreeable subject," he said. "You always were a wonderful woman, Maria.
  Behold me for the time being penniless. The confession is humiliating, but
  true. You have the wherewithal to set me on my legs again. The household is
  asleep, nobody knows that I am here. It would distress me beyond measure to
  be compelled to resort to violence, Maria."</p>

  <p>"Would it?" the woman asked, with a bitter sneer. "Then a heart and a
  conscience must have been born in you since last night. You will get nothing
  from me. What you find you may keep."</p>

  <p>For an instant she glanced at the bed. De Lava saw the look, and, like a
  flash, put the right interpretation upon it. He began to drag at the
  mattress. The whole thing came away on the floor, and the pile of flashing
  stones lay disclosed. With a chuckle of triumph the thief grabbed them.</p>

  <p>This action roused Lady Amory to fury. The sane look faded from her eyes,
  and she became wild and ungovernable again. She beat with her hands madly on
  De Lava's shoulders, and raised her voice until scream after scream rang
  through the silent house. With a muttered curse De Lava tried to shake her
  off, while the gems scattered themselves about the floor in a shimmering
  stream of blue and yellow flame.</p>

  <p>The din was at its height when Sexton uttered a warning cry. De Lava
  dashed to the dressing-room window and looked out. Sexton was struggling with
  somebody, whilst another figure was climbing up the ivy.</p>

  <p>"Drop back or I fire," De Lava said, in a hissing, whisper. "If you don't
  stop I'll shoot the pair of you."'</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Ronald promptly jumped to the ground. If the speaker was
  armed, this was a case where discretion was the better part of valour. Ronald
  and Dick had waited too long. Just as De Lava sprang from the window the door
  of the bedroom was flung open and Sir Horace rushed in. By this time De Lava
  and Sexton were running for dear life across the fields towards Shoremouth.
  Pursuit in the circumstances was dangerous. Besides, they were known to
  Ronald and Dick although both were ignorant of the fact that they had been
  recognised&mdash;so they might be arrested at leisure.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace put his head out of the window. Dick slunk back.</p>

  <p>"I must not be seen," he whispered. "I'll be off to my hiding-place. Tell
  my father it's a friend of yours, and don't let out that you know those
  fellows. Remember, they are in possession of a secret that may be useful to
  us. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Ronald explained up to a point. At Sir Horace's invitation he climbed up
  the ivy and entered the dressing-room. In the bedroom Lady Amory was
  collecting her scattered treasures.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything missing?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory glanced at him suspiciously. She understood the question. "A
  diamond star," she said. "I have everything else. To-morrow I will send them
  all back to my cottage. Give me the matches so that I may make the sign
  again."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace led the way into the dining-room. "She doesn't know what has
  happened," he said. "I'm greatly obliged to you, Mr. Bastable, and very sorry
  the poor woman has lost the diamond star."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A good night's rest did wonders for Sir Horace. He slept soundly in spite
  of the burglary, to the details of which Vera listened with some
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Nothing of this kind had occurred at Oversands before, and the knowledge
  that the house could be so easily entered was disquieting. Lady Amory was
  taking her breakfast upstairs as if nothing had happened. She had entirely
  forgotten the exciting events of the previous evening.</p>

  <p>"I had my hand on the fellow," Sir Horace said. "I believe I would have
  collared him if he had not put out the light. The coolest hand I ever came
  across. He was armed, and threatened to shoot young Bastable, who tracked him
  here. Bastable was waiting below with a friend of his."</p>

  <p>Vera smiled faintly. She was wondering what her father would have said had
  he known who Ronald Bastable's friend was.</p>

  <p>"The thieves got away with nothing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no," Sir Horace explained. "I was in time to prevent
  wholesale plunder, but the diamond star had vanished. It's very annoying, but
  your aunt has nobody to blame but herself. I have worries and anxieties
  without this additional burden on my shoulders."</p>

  <p>"You will bear them bravely," Vera smiled.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, my dear. I am not likely to forget that I am an Amory. But
  there is no hurry, my dear child, no hurry, I assure you. My post-bag this
  morning is exceedingly satisfactory. I hear that one of my speculations has
  turned out magnificently. It is too early to speak certainly, but there is
  more than a chance that we may never leave Oversands. But we will go into the
  matter more fully later. Meanwhile, there is no cause for anxiety, none
  whatever."</p>

  <p>Vera listened with relief. It was a real happiness to see her father so
  bright and cheerful. He was carrying himself now with all his old easy
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"Then you need not be afraid of Joseph Bastable?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Sir Horace said. "Metaphorically speaking, I can snap my
  fingers in his face. I am spared that humiliation."</p>

  <p>Vera turned presently to the morning paper. It was her habit to glance
  through it after breakfast. Public affairs were dull apparently, for the
  editors continued to make the most of the "Safe Mystery." The disappearance
  of the lawyer, Bowen, was still the topic of the day. There were columns of
  it. Vera was interested, because Bowen had been a friend of Dick's.</p>

  <p>But this was not all. The editor of the Daily Review had discovered a side
  issue of the case and given prominence to it. Vera read the paragraph with a
  pale face and a sinking at her heart:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    "A curious thing in connection with the 'Safe Mystery' has come to light.
    It seems that for the last two days nothing has been seen of Mr. Richard
    Amory, of the Stock Exchange, who was an intimate friend of Mr. Bowen's.
    Mr. Amory, who is the only son of Sir Horace Amory, of Shoremouth, left his
    lodgings two days ago immediately after breakfast, presumably on his way to
    business. He has not been seen since. Inquiries at Mr. Amory's office give
    some colour to the statement that Mr. Amory is on a flying visit to Paris,
    but it is somewhat strange that these two gentlemen, who are so intimate,
    should be missing at the same time. Mr. Amory's relatives profess to be
    quite easy in their minds."<br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>It was an unfortunate paragraph. Directly she had read it Vera telephoned
  her father at the bank. He refused to take it seriously.</p>

  <p>"The papers must say something," he replied. "You may depend upon it that
  Dick is all right. If he had wanted money he would have let me know. Why, the
  boy has no business to look after. He's either in Paris or Monte Carlo. You
  mustn't detain me now; I have two or three people waiting to see me."</p>

  <p>Vera had expected some notice to be taken of Dick's movements, but her
  father knew nothing. It was clear the matter could not be ignored. In sheer
  desperation she rang up Ronald Bastable, on the chance of finding him at
  home. By good luck be answered.</p>

  <p>Yes, he had seen the paragraph, which must be answered at once. If the
  insinuation were allowed to pass unchallenged the consequences might be
  serious. Dick's clerk must have a letter in his employer's handwriting to
  prove to the editor of the Review that his inference was a mistaken one.</p>

  <p>"I'll see Dick at once," he said. "Then I will go to London this afternoon
  and see that the Review makes a proper apology to-morrow. Please don't worry
  yourself any more about the matter. How is Lady Amory this morning!"</p>

  <p>"As usual," Vera replied. "She is happy, and has not the least
  recollection of last night's scene. Do you think the thieves are likely to
  try again?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure they will not," Ronald said, with conviction. "I know who they
  are, and where they are to be found when the proper time comes. There is a
  mystery here which I am determined to solve. If these fellows were arrested,
  all my plans would be ruined. Meanwhile they will be closely watched. I will
  give word to the police in due season."</p>

  <p>As a result of this conversation Ronald travelled up to town late in the
  same afternoon with two letters of Dick's in his pocket&mdash;the one for
  Amory's clerk, the other for the editor of the Review. They were sufficient
  to allay suspicion, and conveyed the impression that Amory was on the
  Continent on business of importance that he could not publicly discuss.
  Incidentally a hint was given to the editor of the Review that he would do
  well to mind his own business. Immediately on the delivery of this Ronald
  made his way to Scotland Yard. He wanted to see the inspector who had charge
  of what was called the "Safe" case.</p>

  <p>He was invited to see Inspector Kite. That official was still holding
  Ronald's card in his hand as the latter entered. There was a peculiar smile
  on his face.</p>

  <p>"I have wanted to see you, Mr. Bastable," he said.</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded coolly. All the same, he was rather taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Because I have something to show you presently," Kite went on.
  "Meanwhile, I should like to hear your business first."</p>

  <p>Ronald produced a copy of the Review and pointed to the offensive
  paragraph.</p>

  <p>"It's about this," he said. "I am a friend of the family. One makes
  allowance for the traditions of our newspapers, but this is going too far.
  Mr. Richard Amory was a personal friend of that unfortunate Bowen, but there
  is absolutely nothing to justify this paragraph. You can read it in several
  lights&mdash;you can assume, if you like, that Mr. Amory has been made the
  victim of the same gang who carried off Mr. Bowen. On the other hand, it may
  also be implied that these two gentlemen have hit upon a clever form of
  disappearance, mainly with the idea of cheating their creditors."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that that is not the case?" Kite asked.</p>

  <p>Ronald affected an amusement he was far from feeling. "That is your little
  joke," he said. "As a matter of fact, Mr. Amory was in England yesterday, and
  has written to the Review asking for an apology, which will appear to-morrow.
  He has some very important transaction in hand which renders it necessary
  that his movements should be kept secret. He will be on the Continent for
  some days. He frequently leaves his office like this."</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it," Kite said, coolly.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir," Ronald protested, "you surely don't infer that&mdash;-
  "</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bastable, I infer nothing," Kite went on, quietly. "We have a
  singular crime to unravel, and we have many ways of doing it. It may be that
  Mr. Bowen has been the victim of a gang of rascals; it may be that this is
  only a smart dodge to&mdash;but we need not go into that yet. Our first duty
  is to find out all we can about the ways and habits of the missing man. This
  involves inquiry as to his associates. At present I am bound to admit that we
  have not progressed very far. But one never knows what some trifle may lead
  to. However, we've found the safe."</p>

  <p>"So you've got that," Ronald cried. "Where did you manage to find it?"</p>

  <p>"It was fished up out of the Thames at Rotherhithe. That was a bit of
  luck. Some bargemen found it when they were dredging for an anchor. The safe
  was locked and the key missing. When we opened it there was nothing inside
  but a solitary half-sheet of notepaper in one of the drawers. As this had
  slipped down the back of one of the drawers it was probably overlooked. This
  brings me to the point. I told you I wanted to see you, sir, and it was in
  connection with the half-sheet of notepaper. Being a friend of Mr. Amory's, I
  have been asking a few questions about you. And now as to the piece of paper.
  What do you make of that, sir?"</p>

  <p>Kite handed the document over to Ronald. He read carefully as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The address is Joseph Bastable, High House, Shoremouth.<br>
    Good luck to you, and may you get what you want,<br>
    but I doubt it.&mdash;<br>
    <br>
    J.T."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"We are as much in the dark as you are," Kite admitted, candidly. "This
  document has been in existence for some time. You can see how discoloured it
  is, and how brown on the creases where it has been worn by being carried
  about in somebody's pocket. Goodness knows what it means. It may have no
  connection with the mystery; on the other hand, it may be of great
  importance. I shall be glad if you will make a copy of it and ask your
  father's opinion on the matter. He may be able to tell us who this J.T. is
  who wrote the letter."</p>

  <p>"He might recognise the writing," Ronald said. "If you care to trust the
  original to me, I fancy it would facilitate matters."</p>

  <p>Kite hesitated for a moment, then placed the scrap of paper in an envelope
  and handed it to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I shall be obliged if you will let me know
  something definite as soon as possible. You may be of assistance to us
  here."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best," Ronald smiled. "Have you any clue yet?"</p>

  <p>"Only the vaguest. A clerk who called at Ivy Court at the time when both
  Mr. Bowen's assistants were away says that he saw a tall man in the office,
  who told him that he was in charge for a few minutes. That was one of the
  gang, undoubtedly. My informant is very hazy as to what the stranger was
  like, as the office is dark and the stranger's face was hidden in a
  newspaper. He wore on his right hand a marquise ring in diamonds and rubies
  that struck the clerk as very much out of the common."</p>

  <p>Ronald started. Fortunately Kite was not looking at him. "Really!" he
  said. "That ought to help you, Mr. Kite. And if there is nothing else I can
  tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Ronald felt that he had reason to congratulate himself upon
  his self-possession. He had come very near to be betraying himself when Kite
  had alluded with dramatic suddenness to the marquise ring. In a flash it
  dawned upon him that he could bring about the arrest of the author of the
  "Safe" mystery at any moment. For it was as clear as daylight that the
  inventor of the ingenious piece of rascality was none other than Count Henri
  De Lava, at present quietly planning a new coup at Shoremouth.</p>

  <p>It had been on the tip of Ronald's tongue to say as much. But by doing
  this he would have upset his plans and perhaps injured Dick Amory at the same
  time. What a strange tangle it all was! How queerly everybody, or nearly
  everybody, he was interested in was being drawn into the net! That his own
  father should have suddenly become a pawn in the game was amazing. For Joseph
  Bastable ordinarily was only a keen business man, leading a commonplace and
  monotonous life.</p>

  <p>Ronald had plenty to think of as he travelled to Shoremouth that same
  night. He had no opportunity of laying the matter before his father till
  after breakfast the following morning. Bastable gave him a few minutes,
  grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"I won't detain you any longer than I can help," he said. "You have
  followed what the papers call the 'Safe Mystery,' I presume?"</p>

  <p>Bastable replied that he had. Audacity and courage always appealed to him.
  Had he not been a successful business man he might have been an equally
  successful criminal.</p>

  <p>"Well, the safe has been found," Ronald said. "It was dredged up from the
  bottom of the Thames. I happened to be at Scotland Yard yesterday on
  business, and saw the inspector who has the affair in hand. Naturally, he
  knew my name and that I was a son of yours. The safe contained a scrap of
  paper which was wedged behind one of the drawers. On that paper were your
  name and address."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Bastable cried. "What are you telling me?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but what is true," Ronald went on. "Your name and address are on
  the paper together with a few words. I prevailed upon Inspector Kite to let
  me have the original; I thought that perhaps you would recognise the writing.
  Here it is."</p>

  <p>Bastable snatched eagerly at the paper. He betrayed a haste and eagerness,
  not to say a nervousness, that surprised Ronald. He had never seen his father
  so perturbed before. He read the words until he must have had the formation
  of every letter by heart. The red face was pale and clammy, his big hands
  shook.</p>

  <p>"Can't tell you anything," he said, hoarsely. "I'm ready to swear that I
  never saw that list before. Somebody wanting a loan, perhaps. Might be a
  begging letter. Tell your detective friend I'm sorry I can't help him."</p>

  <p>Ronald went away with an uneasy feeling that his father was lying. He had
  not failed to see the extraordinary effect produced by these apparently
  innocent words. He was convinced that they had come as a great shock to the
  old man.</p>

  <p>Bastable sat at the table in a brown study. His lips were pressed tightly
  together. Gradually he gained the mastery over himself. His big, coarse face
  grew hard and bitter. He did not look like the kind of man to be imposed
  upon.</p>

  <p>"So he's back again!" he muttered. "Let him try any of his tricks on with
  me! Let him only dare to show his face in Shoremouth, and
  I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He pounded one great fist into the other passionately. He would go down to
  the office and take it out of somebody.</p>

  <p>With his hat on the back of his head he strode off to the bank. His
  signature appeared on the official papers as manager, though for the most
  part the ordinary routine was supervised by an assistant. There were no
  letters of importance this morning, with the exception of a curt note from
  Sir Horace Amory asking Bastable to favour him with a call. Bastable smiled
  sourly.</p>

  <p>"Wants me to dance attendance upon him," he muttered. "Confound his
  insolence! A pauper like that to treat me in this way. I daresay the fool
  thinks that I shall only be too glad to renew that note for him. By gad! it
  wouldn't be a bad idea to tackle him in his own office. I'll get him to go
  down on his knees and kick him afterwards. I don't suppose he has the
  money."</p>

  <p>The mere thought of this was so distasteful that Joseph Bastable discarded
  it at once. He had his own peculiar sources of information, and he did not
  hesitate to stoop to bribery to get it if it were worth his while.</p>

  <p>He despatched the bank business presently and strode down the High-street
  to the old-fashioned premises where the offices of Amory and Sons were
  situated. Sir Horace was in his room and would see Bastable in a few minutes.
  The latter paced about the waiting-room fuming and angry. Amory might keep
  him like this, but he should pay for it all, by gad! He should suffer for
  this!</p>

  <p>But there was no sign of nervousness about Sir Horace. He bowed politely
  to his visitor and motioned him to a chair. The easy, natural manner, the
  calm assumption of social distinction, set the blood humming in Bastable's
  veins. This was the style he had tried so hard to affect. He knew perfectly
  well that congenitally he was an overbearing bully.</p>

  <p>"This is very good of you, Mr. Bastable," Sir Horace said.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," Bastable replied, stoutly. "No it isn't, Amory; and you
  know it."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace looked almost sadly at the speaker. "I think you have forgotten
  something," he said. "It is only a little common politeness, but the little
  things count, you know. I prefer, if you please, that you should give me my
  proper name as I am giving you yours. In the old days, when you used to touch
  your hat to your old master, I always addressed you as Mr. Bastable. Really,
  you will gain nothing by being needlessly offensive. I am a gentleman, and I
  shall be glad if you will remember the fact."</p>

  <p>Bastable had no reply for the moment. There was something so cool, so
  cutting, and contemptuous, in the slowly spoken words that Bastable was
  reduced to silence. The interview was not falling out as he had anticipated.
  The sarcastic line should have been his.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can't match you at that game, I know," he said. "But you can't live
  on it. You can't pay your debts with insolent words. It won't help you in the
  matter of that note of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bastable bit off the words gently. He had come very near to betraying
  himself. That blow was intended to fall at the last moment, to take Sir
  Horace by surprise and reduce him to wreck and disaster.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wish to see me?" he asked, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," Amory went on, with exquisite humour and politeness, "why
  did you interrupt yourself in that abrupt manner? You were just going to
  introduce the very topic that I wanted to see you about. That acceptance of
  Mr. Kennedy's, you know."</p>

  <p>Bastable glanced angrily at the speaker. "How should I know anything about
  it?" he demanded. "Kennedy banked with me&mdash;I am his executor, and all
  his papers and securities will come to me sooner or later. It is possible
  there is an acceptance of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bastable, why do you lie to me like this? What do you expect to gain
  by it?"</p>

  <p>Joseph Bastable maintained a sullen silence. The enemy had too many guns
  for him. He was casting round in his mind to ascertain who had betrayed him.
  He was not a ready thinker; the quick, rapier-like play of Amory's wit
  puzzled and confused him. He preferred to plot and scheme and work
  underground like the mole; he needed days and weeks of plodding thought for
  his dirty purposes.</p>

  <p>"I had better enlighten you," Sir Horace went on. "The acceptance is for
  twenty thousand pounds, and so far as I know is in the possession of your
  bank. It has been more than once renewed, because it has paid me better to
  renew than to meet the bill. But now that you are practically my creditor, I
  am anxious to settle the claim as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," Bastable said, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Really! Oh, come; I pay a higher compliment to your intelligence than
  that. The note is due this week, and if I don't meet it I shall have a writ
  served on me. All Shoremouth will know it in twenty-four hours. It is
  perfectly clear that you have figured it out in your own mind. If you will
  send this note round to me, you shall have cash for it within an hour."</p>

  <p>Bastable changed his ground. He began to regret his impetuosity. The
  interview was going against him; he was feeling small and humiliated. It was
  only natural to him to judge others by his own standard, and to imagine that
  Amory was bluffing him. He felt sure the money would not be forthcoming. If
  it would be, then Amory was going to make use of funds that belonged to other
  people. And there could only be one end to that kind of thing. Still, the
  challenge had been thrown down, and it was necessary that it should be
  met.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I'll go over to the bank and get the note. I'll
  take Bank of England&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you will take Bank of England notes in payment," Sir Horace
  said. "I want you to be satisfied there is nothing wrong. Shall I bring my
  money across to your office and settle it there, or shall
  I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll come here," Bastable said, hastily. "I'll not keep you long."</p>

  <p>He needed time to think. Amory's tactics were too quick and elusive for
  him. Besides, he wanted to be certain that the note was in his
  possession.</p>

  <p>He had never actually had it in his hand, though Mr. Kennedy had often
  mentioned the matter to him, and he understood that the document was amongst
  the papers deposited by him with the bank before the trip abroad which had
  ended so disastrously. Certainly the note was on the list of securities, for
  Bastable had seen that; indeed, it had inspired the little scheme for Amory's
  ruin that had come instantly to Bastable's mind on hearing of Kennedy's
  decease.</p>

  <p>He went back to his bank and called for Mr. Kennedy's papers. There were a
  great pile of deeds and debentures and securities of all kinds, and it was
  necessary to go through them methodically. But though they were turned over
  twice and subjected to a most rigid scrutiny, the note was not there!</p>

  <p>Bastable ground his teeth furiously. The note was on the list, right
  enough, but the document was missing. Possibly Kennedy had changed his mind
  at the last moment, and had forgotten to mention the fact.</p>

  <p>But the great point remained&mdash;note was not there! Bastable mumbled
  curses in his beard. It looked as if Amory would slip through his fingers
  after all. But the note was in existence somewhere! Amory was going to meet
  it with funds he had embezzled from his clients. This must be forced to an
  issue.</p>

  <p>Bastable sat down and thought it out carefully. He would not let his enemy
  escape like this. Even if he had to commit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>He rang the bell. A clerk came to the summons.</p>

  <p>"Go over to Amory's, and see Sir Horace," Bastable said slowly. "Tell him
  I am sorry to cause trouble, but the document we spoke of just now is in
  London, in the hands of our agents. Say I am writing for it, and hope to call
  on Sir Horace with it the day after to-morrow."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Loud, blustering, and self-important as he was, Bastable
  could hardly be reckoned as a bully in his own household. He had a poor
  opinion of women as a whole, and seldom deigned to consult his wife about
  anything. But in his secret heart he was proud she was a lady, and, where
  social observances were concerned, he was afraid of her. Like most of his
  class, he was a snob&mdash;though he would have resented it had anybody told
  him so.</p>

  <p>But for once Joseph Bastable was inclined to show the stuff he was made
  of. For the last two days he had been moody and irritable. There was a
  furtive look about him that puzzled and rather annoyed Ronald. Had it been
  anybody but his father, he would have said that this was a person who had
  done something wrong.</p>

  <p>The matter culminated at breakfast. The blood flamed into Ronald's face at
  some remark of Bastable's in reply to a question from his wife.</p>

  <p>"Will you recollect that you are speaking to my mother, sir?" he said.</p>

  <p>Bastable's coarse red face flushed. He would have given a thousand pounds
  of his beloved money to possess that quiet, incisive manner of speaking. He
  was proud in a way to feel that his son had it. The manner came of breeding,
  the mixing with people of position. Bastable understood these things, but he
  knew that they were not for him.</p>

  <p>"I won't be dictated to by you," he said. "Ashamed of me, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"At certain moments, almost," Ronald said, gently. "Just now, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>Bastable subsided into sullen silence. He ate his breakfast as if he bore
  it a personal grudge. He tendered a sort of apology to Ronald later.</p>

  <p>"I've had a great disappointment," he muttered. "Walk as far as the office
  with me. If you've nothing better to do, I shall be glad if you will give me
  a hand with my private correspondence this morning. Can you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to do all day," Ronald replied.</p>

  <p>"Come along, then. I'm disappointed, my boy. You know how I had set my
  heart upon a first-class golf links for Shoremouth. I am told that a thousand
  pounds would make it one of the finest links in the Kingdom. Six thousand
  pounds for a club-house with all the modern luxuries would pay. My idea was
  to run it myself. I'd get some golfing swell and make him secretary. The land
  as it stands is worth practically nothing. I expected to get if from Amory
  for a few hundreds. In the course of time I would sell the fringe of those
  downs at fancy prices for golfers' houses. People would come here from all
  parts of the world. But when I approached Amory, hang me if he'd sell me a
  yard!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he had other views," Ronald suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not he. It's pure stubbornness. He made a personal matter of it. I wanted
  the lower part of the ground, because it is nearer to the town. But, if
  necessary, I'm going to build a bridge over the river a few hundred yards
  above the Red House, so that from the links the town will not be more than a
  mile. Then I shall use my own land on the far side of the river, and be
  independent of our stiff-backed friend. I had him in a cleft stick a day or
  two ago. I was in a position to make him sue for terms, but he got to hear
  about it, confound him!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean in the matter of the Kennedy business!" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"That's it. But he got to know, or perhaps he anticipated matters. If he
  didn't then somebody in my employ betrayed me. I've my suspicions."</p>

  <p>Ronald flushed uncomfortably. If his father had his suspicions, then
  somebody would suffer before long. It might be an innocent person who had a
  wife and family dependent upon him.</p>

  <p>"Your suspicions are wrong," Ronald said. "I told Sir Horace myself."</p>

  <p>Bastable pulled up short in his stride. "You&mdash;you infernal&mdash;I
  mean you idiot!" he blazed out. "That you should dare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are attracting attention," Ronald said, quietly. "People are staring
  at you. My dear father, it has been your fancy to make me what you call a
  gentleman. I am grateful to you for that. But then you have afforded me a
  training that places us as far apart as the poles. No doubt, from your point
  of view, it is quite legitimate to take advantage of Sir Horace. You regard
  it as business. But those who taught me my code would regard it as a
  dishonourable transaction. I think they are right. I felt ashamed of you when
  you told me what you were going to do. Therefore, I took the first
  opportunity of warning Sir Horace. I am glad to know that I have been of
  assistance to him."</p>

  <p>Bastable contested the point no further. He was always conscious of a
  sense of meanness and inferiority when Ronald spoke to him like that. In an
  odd way he felt that Ronald was right. The boy might be a fool, he might have
  a poor head for business, but he knew the ways of the world, and more than
  once the older man had benefited by that knowledge.</p>

  <p>Conscious, perhaps, that he had gone too far, Ronald sat down with the
  intention of doing a good morning's work. He often helped his father in this
  way. There was a mass of correspondence to deal with, and Ronald slogged
  steadily at it. He was thinking of nothing but the work in hand when he
  stumbled upon a letter that staggered him. He read it twice:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    <b>"481, Lincoln's Inn Yard,</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>"London.</b><br>
    <br>
    "Dear Sir,<br>
    <br>
    "We have carefully considered yours of the 13th inst., and regret that we
    cannot see our way to regard your views as correct.<br>
    <br>
    "According to the correspondence before us, both from yourself and Mr.
    Arthur Bowen, it is clear that our late client was misled as to the nature
    of the securities. We are unfortunately unable to consult Mr. Richard
    Amory, who at present is on the Continent and likely to be away from London
    for some time.<br>
    <br>
    "After careful consideration and investigation we are forced to the
    conclusion that our late client has been the victim of what looks
    remarkably like systematic fraud either on the part of Mr. Bowen or Mr.
    Amory. We are not prepared in the present state of affairs to say who
    really is the guilty party, but unless we have some satisfactory assurance
    from you in the course of the next week we shall place the matter in the
    hands of the proper authorities.<br>
    <br>
    "We are not disposed to admit that Mr. Bowen has been the victim of a gang
    of desperadoes; on the contrary, we are inclined to think that a close
    examination of affairs will disclose something highly ingenious in the way
    of a fraud. Mr. Bowen was kidnapped from his office on a certain date; he
    vanished early in the afternoon, and this being so, it is odd that we
    should have received a letter from him next day posted in London on the day
    of the alleged outrage. It may be argued that the letter was posted before
    the raid on his office, but this is disproved by the envelope which
    contained the letter, which envelope we enclose herewith. You will see that
    it bears the 9.40 p.m. postmark, and that it was posted in the West Central
    district. Kindly return it at your convenience.<br>
    <br>
    "In view of this significant fact, we shall be glad to have a call from you
    as soon as possible.&mdash;Yours faithfully,<br>
    <br>
    <b>"HEREPATH AND BUTLER."</b><br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>The name of the firm was familiar to Ronald. It was that of one of the
  most prominent companies of solicitors in the City of London. The letter was
  vague in its way, yet there was a cold suggestiveness about it that Ronald
  did not like. He read it again and again; he could think of nothing else for
  the time. It was incomprehensible, though the hint of a threat was plain. In
  some way his father had been mixed up in some transaction that this
  respectable firm of solicitors regarded with disapproval&mdash;or worse!</p>

  <p>The tangle was growing still more intricate. The more Ronald fumbled with
  the ravelled words the more complicated the knots became. One point, however,
  was perfectly clear, no fatal result had followed the spiriting away of
  Arthur Bowen. Without doubt he had posted that letter hours after the attack
  upon him in his office. Somebody might have found the letter and dropped it
  into the box, but that was exceedingly unlikely. The postmark was plain.
  Whoever posted the letter had forgotten this, or had reckoned upon its being
  unnoticed. It was seldom that a postmark stood out so legibly as the one on
  the envelope Ronald was holding in his hand.</p>

  <p>How did his father come to have dealings with these people? What had he
  done to cause Herepath and Butler to write to him in this offensive manner?
  He had admitted that he had followed the "Safe Mystery" with interest, but
  had said nothing to suggest that he was himself associated with any of the
  leading characters in the drama.</p>

  <p>Ronald was still pondering over the puzzle when his father returned. He
  was in high spirits; he had got the better of somebody, and expanded
  accordingly. There was a spreading smile on his face as he took the letter
  from Ronald's hand.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am not competent to deal with this," the latter said.</p>

  <p>The smile faded from Bastable's face as he read. He grew flabby, and
  Ronald saw his hand was shaking strangely.</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to this myself," he said. "It's a private matter, and I am
  sorry you opened it. I daresay you wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It would be strange if I didn't," Ronald said. "You never told me you
  were in any way mixed up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by mixed up?" Bastable demanded. "Anybody would think
  that I was one of a gang who set about Bowen. I couldn't say anything for the
  simple reason that my lips were sealed. Bowen has done a good deal of
  business for me in connection with investments which I desire the lawyers
  here should know nothing about. The boasted secrecy of a lawyer's office is
  all bosh. I was fool enough to guarantee an account for Bowen, and it looks
  as if he had been robbing his clients."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">"These people are acting for trustees?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"That's it, my boy. Some client of Mr. Bowen's is dead, and the trustees
  have employed another firm of solicitors. So far that is pretty plain. Bowen
  has been using my name to a greater extent than he was entitled to. I'll run
  up to town to-morrow and put these people in their proper place. Still, it's
  deuced odd about Bowen."</p>

  <p>"Very," Ronald said, drily. "I see that Dick Amory is mixed up in the
  business too. Were you aware of that?"</p>

  <p>Bastable showed signs of sullen impatience. "I'm not in the witness-box,"
  he muttered. "Anybody would think you were cross-examining me. As I know a
  good deal about Bowen, it is only natural I should be aware that young Dick
  Amory acted as his broker. There is no mystery about it so far as I am
  concerned, my boy. I'll see these people to-morrow. When I come back I may
  have something to tell you."</p>

  <p>Ronald left the office later in a thoughtful frame of mind. Dick Amory's
  danger was closer than the latter imagined. It was clear that the suspicions
  of Herepath and Butler were aroused. Failing Bowen, they would call on Amory
  to produce his books directly he showed his face. It would be necessary to
  see Dick without delay.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Bastable was pacing up and down his office moodily. He was
  alone, and the mask was dropped. The letter had made a deep impression upon
  him. After he had pondered the matter, he rang his bell savagely.</p>

  <p>"Has John Turk been here to-day?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the clerk replied. "He has been waiting a long time to see
  you."</p>

  <p>Bastable waved his hand impatiently. The door of the office opened, and a
  little old man entered with a furtive air. He was dressed in seedy, shiny
  black clothes, his boots were down at heel, and his sodden white face and red
  nose told their own story. With it all, however, he had the vague appearance
  of having started life under happier auspices.</p>

  <p>"Well, John," Bastable said, with a certain rude good humour, "have you
  come to take up that little cheque of yours?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Turk said, meekly. "I understand that you wanted to see
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I do. Perhaps I could put something in your way. We will
  postpone that trifling matter for the present. Most people would have
  prosecuted you over that affair. And to try it on with me of all people!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I had been drinking," Turk said, humbly.</p>

  <p>"Drinking! Of course you had. What else have you done the last score of
  years? With your brains, you should have made a fortune by this time. But,
  even as it is, you are to be trusted to a certain extent, John. Never ever
  been known to betray a secret. Have you got that paper for me?"</p>

  <p>Turk glanced cautiously around him. It was as if he suspected the
  furniture of having ears. He crept across to the door and satisfied himself
  that it was fast. Then he drew a long slip of blue paper from his pocket and
  handed it to Bastable. The latter regarded it long and carefully through his
  glasses. He only wore these on special occasions, but he seemed to need them
  now. He nodded a surly approval.</p>

  <p>"Very good, John," he said "very good indeed. Here are the five pounds I
  promised you. Now, go away, and try to save this money for once."</p>

  <p>Turk went his way unsteadily, and Bastable locked the slip of paper in his
  private safe. Then he forced himself rigidly back to his business routine and
  wrote till lunch-time. He partook of his frugal meal at the club, after which
  he went as far as the offices of Amory and Sons, and asked for a few moments
  with Sir Horace.</p>

  <p>The latter was disengaged, and would see Mr. Bastable at once. Sir Horace
  smiled blandly as his enemy swaggered into his private office.</p>

  <p>"As to the little matter we discussed the other day," Bastable
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"The matter we discussed?" Sir Horace asked, vaguely. "Oh, you mean the
  Kennedy note. I had forgotten that in the pressure of other business. I
  understand that the acceptance was in the hands of your London agents?"</p>

  <p>"It's in my pocket at the present moment," Bastable said, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Really, now! That is interesting, Mr. Bastable. Let me see&mdash;didn't I
  say I should be glad to take it up as soon as possible? Twenty thousand one
  hundred and fifteen pounds, nine shillings, and fourpence, I fancy. Will you
  be so good as to touch the bell for me? Thank you."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace scribbled a few words on a sheet of notepaper and handed it to
  the clerk who came in response to the summons. The subordinate came back a
  few minutes later with a pile of rustling banknotes and a handful of gold and
  silver.</p>

  <p>"I fancy you will find that correct," Sir Horace said. "I should like you
  to count it, so as to make quite sure. Then I will trouble you for the
  bill."</p>

  <p>Bastable fluttered over the notes gravely. He did not know whether to be
  glad or sorry. He had half expected an appeal for time to pay. Still, if he
  were deprived of this revenge, he had another consolation. He was certain the
  money belonged to Sir Horace's clients. When the crash came, it would be a
  resounding one. On the whole, he could afford to wait. All the same he parted
  with the bill with great reluctance. He held it grudgingly in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You can't eat your cake and have it," Sir Horace smiled. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"I'll throw it on the fire," Bastable said, with some show of good
  nature.</p>

  <p>"Indeed you will do nothing of the kind, my dear sir," Sir Horace replied.
  "In its way that paper is an asset. For all you know to the contrary, I may
  have borrowed the money to meet it, and my creditors may insist upon seeing
  the acceptance as a receipt. What a suggestion to come from a man of business
  like yourself!"</p>

  <p>Sir Horace spoke in terms of mild reproach, but the words brought the
  blood flaming into Bastable's face and anger into his eyes. He read some
  subtle meaning in the speech. With unsteady hand he grabbed up the notes and
  gold and tossed the bill on the table, and then, with a surly nod, strode out
  of the office.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace watched him with a calm, cynical smile on his lips. The smile
  was still there as he sat with the slip of blue paper in his fingers. He had
  the air of a man who had gained some coveted treasure at a small outlay. The
  document was cancelled and done with; it could have been destroyed in the
  ordinary course of events, but Sir Horace put it away in the corner of his
  safe.</p>

  <p>"A la bonne heure," he murmured. "This has been a great day for me."</p>

  <p>A clerk was standing by his elbow with a visiting-card in his hand. "The
  gentleman wants to see you, Sir Horace," he said. "Shall I ask him in?"</p>

  <p>Sir Horace podded vaguely. The card bore the name of the Duc de Villier.
  There was no address on the card, nothing to denote the nationality of the
  caller. He came in presently, a tall man of some fifty years of age, with
  grizzled hair and tanned features. He had the right air about him, as Sir
  Horace recognised at a glance.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon my intruding upon you in business hours," the stranger
  said. "I am staying with my friends at Sands Castle, and I motored over
  to-day. You are perhaps not aware that I am a sort of connection of yours by
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Duke?" Sir Horace smiled. "In what way, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Lady Amory, your uncle's widow, is my cousin. For some
  years we have lost sight of one another entirely. As I happened to be in the
  neighbourhood, I thought I would look her up."</p>

  <p>"Pleased to meet you, I am sure," Sir Horace said. "It is rather a
  singular thing, but I have always been in the dark as to the antecedents of
  Lady Amory. She&mdash;well, she is a little peculiar, and sensitive, you
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Mad," the Duke said calmly. "Quite mad, poor thing. She married your
  uncle against the wishes of the family. There was a good deal of coolness on
  both sides, and poor Maria was ultimately forgotten. She and her husband
  lived abroad, did they not?"</p>

  <p>"Almost entirely, till my uncle died. I saw my aunt for the first time
  after his death. She was left to me as a legacy, so to speak. It was
  sufficient for me that she was a lady, you understand. We asked no questions;
  indeed, it would have been useless to do so."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the Duke murmured, sympathetically. "I will tell you the whole
  sad story at a more fitting opportunity. You may blame me for not giving that
  poor creature's claim on us common consideration, especially as Maria and
  myself were such friends at one time. She was really fond of me, and if I
  could see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Duke, of course you shall," Sir Horace said, hospitably. "You are
  staying here some time?"</p>

  <p>"My movements are uncertain," De Villier replied. "I have the castle
  practically to myself for the next day or two, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then come and dine with us this evening," Sir Horace suggested. "By
  motor, this can hardly be more than half an hour from the castle. If you
  would not mind putting ceremony on one side, my daughter and I would be glad
  to see you."</p>

  <p>"That is exceedingly kind of you," the Duke said. "It is all the more kind
  because I deserve no consideration at your hands. I will come with pleasure.
  If I may venture to ask another favour, I should like to meet my poor
  relation alone&mdash;I mean, I shall be grateful if you can arrange for her
  to be in the drawing-room when I am announced and before your daughter is
  present. I am sure you will appreciate this suggestion of mine, Sir Horace.
  It may sound sentimental."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Amory replied. "It reflects great credit on you. I am sure
  that my daughter will fall in with the idea. We dine at eight."</p>

  <p>With a smile and a handshake the Duke departed. It wanted a few minutes to
  eight when his car pulled up before the portico at Oversands. At first sight
  it looked as if the drawing-room was untenanted, but a slim figure in white,
  blazing with gems, came from one of the big windows as De Villier
  entered.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory regarded him with her calm, vague scrutiny for a moment, then
  her face flamed red, and from red changed to white again. She pressed her
  hand to her side and staggered backwards. The Duke managed to catch her.</p>

  <p>"I got your message, Maria," he said. "I came as soon as possible.
  Courage, my dear, courage! So they have followed you to England?"</p>

  <p>Lady Amory clung to her companion. The vague look had left her eyes, which
  were clear and natural. "You have come at last," she whispered. "Thank
  Heaven, you have come at last!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">The more Ronald turned over the situation in his mind the
  less he liked it. He had never cared to analyse his father's character too
  closely; indeed, he had always shrunk from doing so. There were, however,
  times when he felt that, had the relationship been more distant, he would
  have regarded Joseph Bastable with loathing and contempt. He was bound to
  face some plain questions now.</p>

  <p>How far was his father dipped in this shady business? That he was in it
  was proved by the letter from the London lawyers. The tone of that letter
  filled Ronald with uneasiness. It was the kind of missive he would have
  written to anyone he utterly despised, a person lost to every sense of
  decency. The blood mounted to Ronald's face as he thought of it. But his
  father had not even noticed the tone. He had not resented it for a moment,
  had shown none of the warmth, and indignation of an honest man. On the
  contrary, he had taken it quite in the ordinary way. Moreover, the letter had
  frightened him. Beyond doubt the elder Bastable had been alarmed. Ronald had
  never seen such signs of fear in his father before.</p>

  <p>It was clear that Joseph Bastable could have explained much had he chosen.
  The strangest thing of all was to find him mixed up with Dick Amory. Why
  should he concern himself with the affairs of Sir Horace's luckless son? He
  hated the father, as Ronald had reason to know. It was not likely, then, that
  he would go out of his way to be of any assistance to the boy. Unless he
  wanted to ruin him!</p>

  <p>Ronald started as this thought flashed across his mind. He knew his father
  was capable of it. A man who feels no shame in being a professional
  moneylender is not likely to hesitate at much.</p>

  <p>It would not be difficult to drag the truth out of Dick Amory. It would be
  a humiliating business, but for the sake of all parties the facts must be
  disclosed. Ronald was thinking more of Vera than of anybody else.</p>

  <p>He dined early at the club, and afterwards made his way to the Red House.
  Dick Amory, smoking the inevitable cigarette, awaited him.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were never coming," he said. "I'm not blaming you, my dear
  chap, but to sit here hour after hour alone is maddening. For the life of me
  I can't see what is to be the end of it. I'd better go abroad."</p>

  <p>"And so admit you are guilty," Ronald said.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it would look like that?"</p>

  <p>"What else could people think? If you appeared in London and paid all your
  debts first, it would be quite another matter. At present people imagine you
  are on the Continent on business. I daresay some of them are anxiously
  awaiting your return. But they are not dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Some are not," Dick said, with a vicious grin, "and some are."</p>

  <p>"So I understand. Herepath and Butler, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! Bastable, you don't mean to say they're moving?" Amory
  cried. "In that case it's all up. They are the solicitors to the trustees of
  the man who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whom you and Bowen robbed of his money. They are moving, though I am in
  the dark as to what is going on. I saw a letter from them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You saw a letter from them! To whom was it written?"</p>

  <p>Ronald hesitated before he replied. "It is as well to be candid," he said.
  "The letter was addressed to my father. It was not intended that I should see
  it. I didn't like the tone of it; if it had been addressed to me I should
  have been indignant. These people as good as said that Bowen was not dead at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Not dead!" Amory exclaimed. "The man was murdered."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you must not count upon that. Without any desire to be
  offensive, I see you regard this outrage on Bowen as an asset in your favour.
  You can throw the blame of everything on him. But Herepath and Butler refuse
  to believe that he is dead. They have evidence to justify that belief."</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Amory to conceal his disappointment. "Did you see
  the evidence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, I have had it in my hand. At any rate, I have had part of it.
  The evidence takes the form of a letter, written to Herepath and Butler by
  Bowen. The letter was posted many hours after Bowen had been spirited away.
  The postmark is clear. These lawyers do not hesitate to say that the whole
  thing is a clever scheme for getting Bowen out of the way to prevent his
  prosecution. But for that fatal postmark they would probably have allowed
  matters to rest. Now they talk of laying their evidence before the police.
  Your name was mentioned."</p>

  <p>"By jove!" Dick gasped, "then I'm done. There's no help for it now."</p>

  <p>"It looks bad," Ronald went on. "I'm afraid these people know more than we
  give them credit for. Now I come to a more personal matter. Why didn't you
  tell me you have had dealings with my father?"</p>

  <p>Amory looked uncomfortable. "Did it matter?" he asked. "Has it anything to
  do with this affair?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. That is what I have to find out. Your name crops up in the
  letter to my father. How long has this been going on?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a year or two," Amory said, with a poor show of indifference. "But
  really, Bastable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't take that tone, if I were you," Ronald interrupted. "Why
  didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Because I was ashamed of it," Dick burst out suddenly. "You may believe
  me or not, but I wanted to spare your feelings as far as possible. I'm a bad
  lot, Ronald, but I'm a plaster saint compared with your father."</p>

  <p>Ronald's lips quivered, but he said nothing. Amory regarded him
  doubtfully. He had perhaps expected an outburst of indignation or even
  violence. But Bastable was perfectly calm.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said, quietly, "tell me the worst."</p>

  <p>"You are sure you don't mind? Because I shall have to speak very plainly.
  I came in contact with your father about two years ago in connection with a
  customer of the bank. We met more than once in London. You can understand
  that at first I was prejudiced against your father&mdash;as an Amory I would
  be. But he appeared a good sort when I came to know him better. He wasn't
  long in finding out that I was deuced hard up, and helped me. He gave me the
  address of a fellow who lent money on easy terms&mdash;at least, they were
  easy terms at first! Afterwards I found out that I was in the hands of one of
  the biggest scoundrels and bloodsuckers in London. The more I struggled the
  deeper in the mud I stuck. Ever heard of De la Pole and Co.?"</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded. It represented the most notorious rascal in the usury
  line.</p>

  <p>"Well, these were the people. They had most of the money I got from Bowen.
  De Pole, stripped of his assumed name, is Joseph Bastable."</p>

  <p>Ronald gave a gesture of amazement. He had not anticipated so disgraceful
  a revelation.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible!" he murmured. "What would your sister&mdash;I mean,
  what would those whose good-will I value say if they knew?"</p>

  <p>Amory administered a rough-and-ready consolation. "We've nothing to hold
  up our heads about," he said. "If your father is a scamp, my father's son is
  another. Don't worry about Vera. She's a loyal girl; and if she cares for you
  it won't matter what your relations are. Mind, I would have spared you this
  if I could, and that's why I said nothing about my dealings with your father.
  He thinks the De la Pole connection is a profound secret. I got to hear of it
  quite by accident. If you only knew of the dirty work I have done for him?
  What I have done I have done, but I should never have been in this mess if I
  hadn't met your father."</p>

  <p>Ronald desired to hear no more. What he had heard already was a bitter
  blow to his pride and his ambitions. He sat staring gloomily into space. This
  was the end of his castle-building. He could never aspire to Vera Amory now.
  In his eyes the most degraded criminal was scarcely worse than the
  professional moneylender who battened on the misfortunes of others.</p>

  <p>"I don't want that side of the question alluded to again," at last Ronald
  said. "Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that my father was a friend
  of Bowen's. Let us assume, too, that Bowen ingeniously managed to delude
  people into the belief that he had been the victim of an
  outrage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Amory was not listening. His face was anxious and moody. Every road
  before him only led to despair.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">STANDING in the long drawing-room at Oversands, the fading
  light of day on her features, Lady Amory conveyed no impression of mental
  trouble to her companion. She looked him squarely in the face; her eyes had
  the suggestion of many memories in them. She seemed, too, to be part and
  parcel of her surroundings. She might have been the mistress of the fine old
  place welcoming some favoured guests. Yet a few minutes before she had been
  struggling dimly to remember some matter of little import.</p>

  <p>But the stimulus of meeting this old friend and relation had given her the
  spur she needed.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not come before?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear cousin, I could not," De Villier replied. "Besides, there was
  nothing to be gained. Now that Lugi is dead, things are different."</p>

  <p>"Is Lugi dead? Did he die&mdash;in his bed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he came to his end quite naturally. You can imagine what a task it
  has been all these years to protect him from those people. Don Bentes was the
  trouble. But a year or so ago Bentes was killed in the mountains in a vulgar
  quarrel about some woman. We had less to fear after that. Bentes was our most
  implacable foe. We could never make him understand that we were blameless in
  the matter, and that that arch-traitor, De Lava was to blame. If I ever meet
  that scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Lady Amory whispered. "De Lava is here! I have been close to him
  more than once. I have heard him speak."</p>

  <p>"De Lava here!" the Duke cried. "What is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>"You forget. He is after the treasure. He knows everything. Recall to
  yourself the close and confidential terms on which he stood with us for
  years. He knows the whole story of the missing treasure and the suicide of my
  poor sister. But I dare not think of that, because when I do so I get quite
  confused. She died before my eyes, and my husband said that I murdered her. I
  am innocent, I swear!"</p>

  <p>Lady Amory raised her voice so that De Villier glanced anxiously about
  him. With soft and gentle words he soothed her until the flashing hardness
  left her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am certain of that," he said. "You loved poor Julia too well. I know it
  must have been a terrible grief to you, Maria."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was, it was! She flung herself into the quicksands, but before she
  did so she threw the treasure in as well. That it was my treasure made no
  difference. But she was mad at the time&mdash;as mad as I was afterwards.
  Still, it may not be too late to save Sir Horace. You see, I care for him. He
  has been good to me. My dear Victor, it would be impossible to say how kind.
  They have put up with my trying moods without one single word of complaint. I
  am very trying at times, you know. I have always been welcome here; they
  would keep me altogether, if they could. Vera is an angel of goodness. I am
  very fond of that unhappy boy, Dick, who is always getting into trouble. They
  have fallen on evil times, but they never ask me to help them, though they
  are under the impression that I am rich. It is only now and then that I
  realise all this, only when my mind is clear as it is now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I daresay we shall manage to repay their kindness," De Villier said,
  cheerfully. "But there are plenty of troubles before us first. My word, what
  a story we could tell if we chose! But nobody would believe it. A novelist
  who dared to put it on paper would be laughed at. People think romance is
  dead&mdash;they believe a vendetta like ours is found only in the shilling
  shocker. I wish they had had to spend those two terrible years in the
  mountains of Sicily! Why, the house was a fortress, and we dared not go out
  alone or unarmed for fear of the vengeance of Bentes and his followers. De
  Lava worked that very cleverly, Maria. If ever I come across him
  again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door of the drawing-room opened at that moment, and Vera entered. She
  crossed to De Villier and held out her hand. "I am glad to meet you," she
  said. "It has always struck me as strange that we should never see any of my
  aunt's relations."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know that I ought to be ashamed of myself," the duke said, with a
  smile. "I want you to believe that I am. But, really, the fault has not been
  altogether mine. There are reasons why I could not leave Sicily. We have had
  family troubles which you would hardly credit, Miss Amory. Is that not so,
  Maria?"</p>

  <p>Lady Amory answered vaguely. The old weary listlessness was on her again,
  and she seemed to be lost to her surroundings. The mental effort she had just
  gone through had been too much for her. But she was no longer restless; she
  had ceased to fidget with her hands in the nervous way that that worried Vera
  so much at times.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace appeared a moment later, and with him dinner was announced. It
  was not an elaborate meal, though dainty and well cooked, and the wines were
  carefully chosen. Glancing at the old silver across the mass of flowers upon
  the spotless napery, De Villier saw no indication of poverty or want. Sir
  Horace, too, was in one of his most brilliant and most charming moods. It was
  obvious that this was not forced, but natural and spontaneous. Vera was
  wondering if the prosperity her father had hinted at had suddenly dropped
  from the clouds. It was a long time since she could remember so pleasant and
  happy an evening.</p>

  <p>With a feeling of regret she rose at length from the table. Sir Horace
  passed over the silver cigar-box, and intimated that the port stood at his
  guest's right hand. De Villier took a cigar and puffed at it luxuriously.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Sir Horace," he said, "that I have a great admiration for
  your English life? There is nothing more delightful than an English
  gentleman's house. It is in every sense a home. How to manage a household we
  don't seem to understand on the Continent. My places are too big and cold;
  there is too much marble about them. Now, all this appeals to me. Did I tell
  you that I was educated in England?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember your mentioning the matter," Amory said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was at Eton for five years. It was my father's wish that I should
  enter the diplomatic service and be attached to the Italian Embassy in
  London. That would have come about but for a calamity that befell us. I
  cannot tell you the story just now, but you shall hear it in good time.
  Meanwhile, I desire to tender a most abject apology for the way I have
  behaved as to Lady Amory. It has been very shabby to leave her on your hands
  so long."</p>

  <p>"She is Lady Amory," Sir Horace murmured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so. That was gracefully put, Sir Horace. But that does not free
  us from our obligations. Lady Amory brought no money into your family, and I
  understand that her husband made no settlement upon her. That makes your
  conduct all the more generous and magnanimous. The real reason why we did
  nothing was because we could not at the time. You didn't know Lady Amory
  before her marriage?"</p>

  <p>"No," Sir Horace explained. "We did not meet till my uncle died. He and I
  were not very good friends, and I did not come here at all in those days. I
  was with the London agents of my bank. My uncle passed most of his time
  abroad. He died suddenly without making a will, and I came into everything. I
  often say that Lady Amory was a legacy, but none the less welcome on that
  account."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear how your uncle met his death?" the duke asked.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he die in the ordinary way?" Sir Horace inquired.</p>

  <p>"He fell over cliff&mdash;at least, that is the legend. As a matter of
  fact he was murdered. For a year or two before his death he spent some time
  here and some time in Sicily. On one occasion Lady Amory brought her sister
  here. She committed suicide by throwing herself into the quicksands near the
  place you call the Red House. The affair was hushed up, I fancy. People were
  told that an accident had happened to a foreign servant of Lady Amory's. Her
  sister had been obliged to conceal her identity."</p>

  <p>"Surely a lot of unnecessary mystery?" Sir Horace said.</p>

  <p>"By no means unnecessary," De Villier responded, gravely. "If I detained
  you now and told you the whole strange story you would be astounded. Sooner
  or later, you shall have the outline of it. But there are other reasons to
  account for Lady Amory's mental depression besides the troubles she has had
  to endure. Did you know much about her husband?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, as I have already said."</p>

  <p>"Then I will enlighten you somewhat. He was one of the hardest and most
  cold-blooded men I ever met. He was absolutely callous and indifferent to
  suffering. It was always a mystery to me why Maria married him. But a woman
  in love is capable of any vagary. At any rate, she married him, and he began
  almost at once to neglect her. When he died there was not even a will in her
  favour."</p>

  <p>"But you told me he died suddenly," Amory argued. "He might have intended
  to do something for his wife and put it off till too late. He knew, of
  course, that Lady Amory was provided for. She had money of her own."</p>

  <p>"Had!" the duke said, significantly. "It was not what you call property in
  your sense of the word. It could have been converted into money at any
  moment, but it was the kind of thing that it breaks a woman's heart to part
  with. Lady Amory's wealth was in jewellery."</p>

  <p>"Which is a large fortune in itself."</p>

  <p>"Precisely&mdash;if it existed. But to all intents and purposes it has
  ceased to exist. Your uncle was well aware of the fact. When Lady Amory's
  sister made away with herself she cast all the gems&mdash;the grand family
  gems&mdash;into the quicksands. They are there to-day."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace stared at his guest with open-mouthed amazement. "Is that so?"
  he stammered. "Do you mean to tell me&mdash;why, I never heard so surprising
  a story in my life. But Lady Amory has other jewels!"</p>

  <p>"Not one," the duke said. "Not a stone. They were all copied years ago for
  the sake of safety. It is by no means a new plan for the baffling of thieves.
  Every gem that Lady Amory wears to-day is paste."</p>

  <p>"You are not joking?" Sir Horace gasped.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," said the duke, solemnly. "I was never more serious."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace was speechless, his lips twitched, and the healthy red of his
  face was turning gradually to ashen grey.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">In a vague way Sir Horace realised that his guest was
  speaking to him, but he appeared to be enveloped in a dense fog that clouded
  his reason with coldness and doubt and suspicion. He repeated again and again
  the word that seemed to hold his mind to the exclusion of everything else.
  Paste! The whole universe was made of paste. That was what everything
  consisted of nowadays.</p>

  <p>"I fear you are not well," De Villier murmured, politely.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace forced himself to smile. He poured out a glass of brandy and
  gulped it down. The incident might have passed unnoticed with a duller man,
  for, after all, the shock was natural enough. But the guest was a man of the
  world, and divined that Sir Horace had counted on Lady Amory's jewellery.</p>

  <p>There was more of this had the duke only known it. But Amory began to talk
  fast, as if to remove a bad impression.</p>

  <p>"It's my heart," he said. "Nothing to be afraid of, but I have to be
  careful. I get giddy all of a sudden, and have a difficulty in hearing what
  people say. Another glass of port? No! If you have finished your cigar, shall
  we have coffee in the drawing-room?"</p>

  <p>De Villier professed he should like nothing better. He was becoming
  interested in this household. There was romance as well as trouble here. If
  he could avert the latter he would be glad to do so. He had formed a high
  opinion of Vera, apart from the fact that she had been so good to Lady
  Amory.</p>

  <p>The menage was very refined and charming, too. It was sad to think that
  there must be an end of it all unless the fortunes of the family mended.
  Somebody else would acquire this old house and perhaps "restore" it. As a man
  of family, the duke could not but sympathise with Amory.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and took his seat by Vera's side. Lady Amory was
  playing patience in one of the deep-seated windows, as if her whole mind were
  given to the game. Amory wandered about restlessly. He would have given a
  great deal to be in his study with the door closed. De Villier watched him
  closely. The smiling mask had fallen from the old banker's face, and he
  looked weary and haggard.</p>

  <p>De Villier talked with the easy grace of a man of "Eton" who sees all
  things without comment. He admired the arrangement of the pictures and the
  soft reflections of the shaded light. Vera had a gift for disposing flowers
  to advantage&mdash;the light hand and eye that make blooms look as if they
  were growing in a room. She was not unlike a flower herself as she sat
  smiling in her chair.</p>

  <p>"To my mind there is no place like Oversands," she said. "I was born here,
  and I am very seldom away. Even when I go to town, I am always glad to get
  back again. My father is very considerate. He lets me manage the house and
  grounds."</p>

  <p>"That isn't kindness," De Villier remarked. "That is wisdom on his
  part."</p>

  <p>Vera laughed at the compliment. "I am glad you think so," she added. "But
  I am afraid I must steel my heart to leave it. My father is not the business
  man he used to be, or perhaps he has grown old-fashioned. The rival bank,
  with its newer methods, has done us great harm. Besides, my father is too
  good-natured. He cannot listen unmoved to a tale of distress. He has helped
  old customers when he knew that he was throwing away his money. He would not
  have it otherwise, but when I think of leaving Oversands it makes me feel a
  little&mdash;a little&mdash;&mdash;" Vera paused, and her lip quivered.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace stood with his back to the fireplace with a moody frown upon
  his face, and a cry of pain escaped him. De Villier looked up anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Your father is not well," he said.</p>

  <p>Vera rose hastily from her seat. Amory staggered into a chair and lay back
  for a time as if on the point of collapse. When he spoke it was with an
  effort.</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right in a few minutes," he said. "There is not the
  slightest cause for anxiety. My dear duke, I shall be distressed if you think
  of going yet. All I need is to recline on the couch in my study for a few
  minutes. Vera, give me your arm."</p>

  <p>De Villier stood aside politely. He watched the two as they crossed the
  hall. Sir Horace dragged himself along almost painfully till the library was
  reached. He was white and shaky, and looked like an aged man as he dropped on
  the couch.</p>

  <p>"Shall I send for the doctor, dear?" Vera asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Sir Horace gasped. "The doctor can do me no good. It's nothing but
  the worry of the last few months. I had a bit of very bad news just when
  everything seemed bright and cheerful. Perhaps I am frightening myself
  unduly. Go back to the drawing-room and make my apologies to the duke. The
  best thing I can do is to go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall dismiss our guest and attend to you," Vera said. "I couldn't
  sit chattering, feeling that you were in trouble."</p>

  <p>The duke was exceedingly sorry to hear the bad news. He insisted that Vera
  should not consider him. He would wait till his car was ready.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you," Vera said. "You understand my feelings. If you
  don't mind, I will say good-night, as I shall not come down again."</p>

  <p>De Villier held open the door for her. As he closed it gently, Lady Amory
  looked up from her cards.</p>

  <p>"We could not have a better chance than this," she said, clearly and
  naturally.</p>

  <p>De Villier started. For the moment he had forgotten his companion. It was
  strange how the logical side of her mind came uppermost when alone with
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand," he said. "What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>Lady Amory threw down her cards impatiently. "To go as far as the Red
  House," she whispered. "Oh, I have no fear. Many is the hour I spend there
  when the rest of the house is asleep. There is a way down from my bedroom, by
  which I can go out without attracting attention. There is not the faintest
  chance of meeting anybody. Besides, to-night is one of the lowest tides of
  the year, and the stepping-stones are clear of the waves. It is low water at
  ten minutes to eleven. Nobody can teach me anything about the tides
  here&mdash;I know every mood of the water, all the secrets of the sea are
  mine. Come, and I will show you something you have never seen before."</p>

  <p>All this was uttered distinctly in a low whisper. De Villier laid a
  soothing hand upon his companion's arm. The touch quieted her directly.</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to get excited," she said. "I always do when I think of
  the sea and the great grey stretch of sands. But I mean what I say, and so
  long as you are with me I know exactly what I am doing. If you decline to
  come, I must go alone."</p>

  <p>"But consider the time of night. Think of the risk."</p>

  <p>"My dear Victor, there is no risk whatever. Besides, I must go. Something
  drags me on. If I resist the impulse all power of sleep will leave me for
  days. When I get like that I always think of my poor sister and how she ended
  her troubles. When the sands give up their secret, then I shall be myself
  again."</p>

  <p>De Villier looked at her half-sadly, half-affectionately. After all, she
  was still young. It was a matter of twenty-five years since her marriage, and
  then she was only a girl of sixteen. At forty she was in all the prime and
  pride of her beauty. But for the haunting sadness of her face and the
  strange, vacant look in her eyes, she would have been uncommonly attractive.
  And there had been a time when she was the only woman for the Duc de
  Villier.</p>

  <p>"It is a strange fancy," he said. "But I will take you and bring you
  back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I will return alone, as I always do. I will tell you the spot where
  your motor can wait for you. I will make the necessary change in my clothing
  and join you at the end of the drive. It is a lovely night."</p>

  <p>Against his better judgment, De Villier fell in with the suggestion. He
  had not looked forward to a midnight adventure like this. As far as he could
  see, there was nothing to be gained by it. Still, it was possible that Lady
  Amory was in possession of some secret, the key of which she had not given
  him yet.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I will do as you require. It is a queer proceeding
  for one at my time of life, but I was never a very responsible creature."</p>

  <p>They met by-and-by at the end of the drive. Already De Villier's motor had
  gone on to await him at a particular spot. It was rather dark as they struck
  into the path leading to the river, though there would be the last quarter of
  the moon presently. Lady Amory slipped her hand under her companion's arm,
  chatting gaily as she kept step with him. For the moment she had forgotten
  her troubles or the serious purpose of the journey. But as they neared the
  spot her mood grew graver, and De Villier could feel how the hand on his arm
  was trembling.</p>

  <p>They came at length to the low ground that ended in the river. So far as
  De Villier could see in the faint, uncertain light, the place was a tangle of
  rushes&mdash;reeds covering ridges of desolate sandhills in a region remote
  from civilisation. They soon passed the sandhills and came out to the ooze
  and mud left by the tide. De Villier could just make out the grey shaking
  mass which formed the dreaded quicksands. They were incessantly churning, as
  if a vast furnace with fierce fires raged beneath them. There was something
  horribly cruel about the grey landscape.</p>

  <p>"What a spot!" De Villier exclaimed, with a shudder. "Imagine such a
  ghastly place so near to Oversands! It was here that your poor
  sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated to finish the sentence. Lady Amory pointed to a long line of
  rocks that stretched like sentinels across the quicksands.</p>

  <p>"Over there," she whispered. "Those are the stepping-stones. Sometimes
  they are nearly covered, and sometimes they stand out high above the water.
  It depends upon the tide. I have been backwards and forwards a score of times
  when the stones were level with the stream. It was the third one from which
  my sister flung herself. I was standing on this very spot, and saw it. My
  husband accused me of pushing her in; he said that I was insanely jealous of
  her. He little knew how Julia hated him for his neglect and unkindness to me.
  She was mad, of course; she had that wild, ungovernable temper that has
  always been our curse. She fancied I was against her&mdash;that was why she
  took my jewels and her own and threw them all into the quicksands. But nobody
  knows that. I have kept the secret well."</p>

  <p>De Villier was silent. He could have told another story had it been worth
  while.</p>

  <p>"I begin to understand what the fascination of this awful spot is," he
  said. "I have a longing to cross to the other side. Is it safe?"</p>

  <p>"If you take every care. If you slip the sands will suck you down like
  some deadly octopus. No power on earth could save you then."</p>

  <p>De Villier took a step or two forward until he came to the first of the
  stones. As he sprang upon it Lady Amory watched him anxiously. As he was
  about to take the second spring her voice rang out in a scream.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" she cried. "Come back! Somebody has moved the stones."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Lady Amory's keen eye had detected the danger. Every stone
  was as familiar to her as her own bedroom. She could almost have gone
  blindfolded to the spot and made her way to the far side of the stream. For
  years she had been coming here constantly; indeed, every time the dark mood
  was upon her she was in this direction.</p>

  <p>In some way one of the stepping-stones had been tampered with. As a matter
  of fact, it was something more than a stone; indeed, it appeared to be a
  large fragment of rock that reached far below the quicksands for its
  foundation. It looked as if some mighty force had wrenched the top off and
  had then replaced it. Certainly it had never been like this before.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory was clear and alert. The deadly nearness of the peril flashed
  through her mind instantly. The quickest intellect could not have grappled
  with the danger more speedily.</p>

  <p>For De Villier had slipped almost as soon as his foot touched the top of
  the stone. He swayed and staggered from one side to the other, vainly
  struggling to regain his balance, and keenly sensible of what would happen if
  he failed. The pale strip of ragged moon cast a fitful light that played upon
  the grey face of the shifting sands. It was as if millions upon millions of
  discoloured snakes were wriggling and twisting, waiting for their prey.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake throw yourself down flat!" Lady Amory cried. "It is
  your only chance."</p>

  <p>But De Villier did not heed the advice. The words came to his ears dimly.
  Without being afraid, he was conscious of the horror of the situation. There
  are some deaths which it is possible to face with courage and resolution, but
  not one like this. In imagination, De Villier felt himself sinking lower and
  lower, the sand filling his throat.</p>

  <p>It seemed an age, but it was little more than a flash. Again Lady Amory's
  voice rose in shriek, and again her caution passed unheeded. There was not a
  soul to appeal to&mdash;-these two were alone on the verge of the
  universe.</p>

  <p>"Lie down flat!" Lady Amory screamed. "Oh, he is gone!"</p>

  <p>De Villier staggered again and slipped. As his feet struck the face of the
  sands he sank to the knees. With an effort he turned and grasped a splinter
  of rock with his left hand. It was the merest grip, but it sufficed to keep
  him above the surface for the moment. All the while unseen forces seemed to
  be dragging at his legs. There was something horrible in the relentless
  strength that was drawing him under.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory wasted no further breath in useless warning. Heedless of
  danger, she rushed to the rescue. She threw herself from one stone to the
  other so that she might lie flat on the slippery surface.</p>

  <p>"Give me your other hand," she said, hoarsely. "I can help you that way. I
  know the terrible force there is behind the sands. Is not that better?"</p>

  <p>For the moment the danger was averted. Still, the final catastrophe was
  only postponed. Even had it been broad daylight, assistance would have been
  as far off as ever. A long spell of patient endurance would benefit De
  Villier little.</p>

  <p>"I can keep you up now," Lady Amory said.
  "But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was no occasion to finish the sentence.</p>

  <p>"It was brave of you," De Villier said. "I have never seen anything finer.
  This is no ordinary danger. But in an hour or so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can call out," Lady Amory said. "Let us both call for assistance. It is
  only at rare intervals that anybody comes near this dreadful place."</p>

  <p>They shouted again and again. There was no response but the mocking cries
  of the words and the complaining yell of a sea-bird disturbed on his nest.
  Then another louder, more despairing call went up, and this time an answer
  came from the Red House.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory laughed hysterically. De Villier gripped her hand more
  tightly.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" he said. "Try to control yourself a little longer, dear friend.
  No, it was not an echo this time. I distinctly heard a man's voice."</p>

  <p>The voice came nearer still, and a figure loomed large in the
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Hold on a little," the voice said. "Where is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"By the second stepping-stone," Lady Amory explained. "My companion
  slipped off, and I am holding him up as best I can. If you will fetch a
  ladder! There is one in the shed at the back of the Red House."</p>

  <p>The figure on the bank disappeared promptly towards the house. Another
  figure anxiously awaited him.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the matter, Bastable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's your aunt&mdash;Lady Amory," Ronald explained. "They have actually
  been trying to cross to the other side of the river, by the stepping-stones.
  Her companion has fallen in, and Lady Amory is holding him up. They want a
  ladder."</p>

  <p>A curse broke from Dick Amory's lips. "It's courting death to play the
  fool like that in the dark. It's confoundedly hard on me, too. Still, there
  is no reason why I should show up. You can manage alone."</p>

  <p>His voice shook with fear as he spoke. As usual, he was thinking entirely
  of himself. Ronald's lips curled with contempt. He was regretting that he had
  put a hand to help Amory in the time of his trouble; but for Vera's sake he
  would go on. He spoke in tones of anger and disgust.</p>

  <p>"Two lives are at stake; but that makes little difference to you, provided
  you save your own skin. Can't you see it is no time to think about yourself?
  A ladder is needed at once. If you don't help me, by jove! I'll drag you
  there."</p>

  <p>The words had the desired effect. Amory went round the back of the house
  to the shed where the ladder was kept, and between them they carried it to
  the edge of the sands. The ladder was a long one fortunately, and reached
  from the shore to the third stone, where the end rested firmly. Ronald
  crawled along and caught De Villier tightly by the shoulders and turned him
  round so that his hands could grasp the rungs of the ladder.</p>

  <p>"I am most profoundly obliged to you," De Villier said, coolly. "It seems
  a special providence that you should be here to-night. We might have held out
  for an hour, but not longer. I am safe. Will you look to Lady&mdash;&mdash;my
  companion?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Amory shall be my immediate care," Ronald answered. "Now, Dick, get
  on the first stone and help Lady Amory."</p>

  <p>Dick came forward sullenly. It was no longer possible to conceal himself.
  He held out his hands, and Lady Amory jumped ashore. She looked at Dick
  without the slightest sign of recognition in her eyes. Doubtless she was in
  one of her worst moods, he thought. But her whole mind was concentrated upon
  Ronald and De Villier. Ronald was standing up, his feet braced firmly against
  each side of the ladder, straining every nerve to release the duke from the
  terrible grip. Inch by inch the latter crawled along till he was able to
  regain his footing on the stepping-stones. The rest was easy.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory clapped her hands thankfully.</p>

  <p>"Heaven be thanked!" she said. "It is as if an answer had come to my
  prayer. How cool and thoughtful that young man is! Mr. Bastable, is it
  not?"</p>

  <p>She spoke calmly and naturally, but she addressed Dick as if he had been a
  stranger. This was another phase of her extraordinary moods, he thought. But
  as yet she had not looked at him; her whole attention was turned to the other
  two.</p>

  <p>"That is my friend's name," Dick answered.</p>

  <p>At the first word Lady Amory regarded him intently. "Dick!" she cried.
  "Dick! What are you doing here? How long have you been at home? Why did you
  not come and see me this evening?"</p>

  <p>Dick laid a hand on his aunt's arm. He spoke in his softest manner.</p>

  <p>"I want you to try to understand things," he said. "I want you to
  concentrate your mind on all that I say. I have not been at home because I
  dare not go home. I have got into a sad mess, and must not show my face here
  or in London. I am hiding in the Red House, and Bastable is finding me in
  food. But for this accident, I should have kept myself in the background. I
  suppose your companion will have to know now&mdash;I only hope he is to be
  trusted."</p>

  <p>"You need not trouble about that," Lady Amory said, coldly. "That
  gentleman is a relative of mine&mdash;the Duc de Villier. Your secret will be
  safe with him."</p>

  <p>De Villier came up at this moment, and Lady Amory explained briefly. Dick
  had never seen her in this businesslike mood before.</p>

  <p>"Some trifling escapade," the duke said, gaily. "I have been a young man
  myself, Mr. Amory. To find you in hiding here gives the adventure a romantic
  flavour. Will you kindly lead the way to your cave&mdash;I mean the house? I
  should like to take off my wet clothes and dry before a fire."</p>

  <p>They turned into the Red House and entered the dining-room. The thick
  blinds were drawn so that no light could be seen from the outside. But on the
  threshold the little company paused in astonishment at the sight before
  them.</p>

  <p>A brilliant, petrolite lamp stood on the table. Under it was a white
  cloth, and arranged thereon a dainty supper for three people. There were
  silver forks and spoons, a chicken, and a pie, together with a salad, and on
  the sideboard stood an army of bottles with gold foils on the necks.</p>

  <p>"This is very welcome," the duke said, gaily. "If you can find me a
  change, Mr. Amory, I shall be delighted to sup with you afterwards."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">Despite the fact that he was usually a light-hearted
  scoundrel with a humourous philosophy of his own, De Lava was profoundly
  disappointed at the failure of his attempt upon Lady Amory's jewels. In his
  sanguine way he had looked upon this as a certainty. Your criminal is always
  an optimist, and this quality is responsible for a great proportion of crimes
  against property.</p>

  <p>For the successful consummation of the campaign, money was absolutely
  necessary. As a rule, De Lava did not lack the possession of means, but his
  present programme threatened to last longer than he had anticipated.
  Shoremouth itself did not afford many facilities for the making of money.
  Moreover, the hotel bill had been presented with an intimation that a week
  was the limit of credit. Thereupon De Lava had drawn a cheque, half of which
  he had asked for in cash, with the full knowledge that there were no funds to
  meet it.</p>

  <p>He was almost inclined to be despondent as he lounged with Sexton in the
  private sitting-room after breakfast. His face was moody and thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I have given a cheque for our account," he said. "They did not demand it
  at the bayonet point, but it came to much the same thing. Like the Speaker in
  your House of Commons, they were polite, but firm. I persuaded them to let me
  have ten pounds as well. If that cheque is not met the day after to-morrow, a
  distinguished foreigner, a friend of mine, will stand the chance of being
  arrested for fraud."</p>

  <p>"You always were so rash," Sexton said.</p>

  <p>"Audacious," De Lava corrected; "but it pays. Before post-time it is my
  intention to forward the sum of five hundred pounds to my bankers. This done,
  we shall be provided for the campaign. I did not want to tap this particular
  source, because I thought I saw my way to getting a great deal more later. It
  is rather like killing the goose that is going to lay the golden eggs, but it
  can't be helped."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean to blackmail?" Sexton asked.</p>

  <p>"A man who lives here," De Lava explained. "As he happens to be on the
  spot, it will be very convenient. I mean Joseph Bastable."</p>

  <p>Sexton stared at the speaker, and his hard, haggard face expanded in a
  smile. He gave way to a fit of silent laughter.</p>

  <p>"Audacious is the right enough word," he said. "Is there any limit to your
  impudence? Bastable is the last man in the world to part with money. As sure
  as fate he will kick you out of his office."</p>

  <p>De Lava smiled as he lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he said, coolly. "Now, I want you to coach me a little.
  Tell me the facts about that man Batter again. I propose to use his name as a
  lever. I will make an appeal on behalf of his wife and family."</p>

  <p>Sexton grinned. He was by no means averse to seeing his friend's pride
  humiliated. He spoke for some time, while De Lava listened patiently. He
  professed himself satisfied at length.</p>

  <p>"That is sufficient for my purpose," he said. "And now to call upon Mr.
  Bastable, and tap the well-springs of his charity. I am going to enjoy
  myself."</p>

  <p>He went off with the jaunty air of a man on the best of terms with himself
  if not the world. The hotel manager was polite and almost gushing as he
  remembered the cheque in the safe. De Lava called at Bastable's office and
  sent in his card. The great man would see him in a few moments. Bastable
  stood by his desk with the card in his hand. His manner was not particularly
  gracious, for he had the wonted insular contempt for a foreigner.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, Count De Lava?" he asked.</p>

  <p>De Lava bestowed upon him a smile peculiarly sweet and winning. "In the
  first place, my dear sir, you can offer me a chair," he said. "I prefer to
  sit down, as this interview may take some time. I am a man of a scientific
  turn of mind. The practical side of science appeals to me. Before long I hope
  to put on the market an aeroplane that will be both cheap and durable. I am
  looking for a quiet place where I can carry out my experiments without being
  subjected to the annoyance of curious fools. The Red House will suit my
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"The Red House does not belong to me."</p>

  <p>"So I have been told. It is the property of Sir Horace Amory. I understand
  that he has no objection to letting it, subject, of course, to satisfactory
  references. Now, I am a stranger here, and to get this matter settled will
  take more time than I care for. I want to get to work at once. I thought that
  perhaps you would be willing to become responsible for me."</p>

  <p>Bastable smiled sourly. The suggestion amused him.</p>

  <p>"You scientific men have a poor idea of business," he said. "Why should I
  do this for you? You may be a swindler, for all I know."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," De Lava said, genially. "I might. But I don't look it. You
  don't look it either, but, nevertheless, you may be a cold-blooded rascal,
  ready for anything. One always has to take these risks in the world."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to insult me?" Bastable demanded.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," De Lava protested. "I only hint what you might be, just as
  you hinted what I might be. I should not have used the illustration had I not
  known something of you through my old acquaintance Batter. I fancy his
  Christian name was Roger, but I am not sure."</p>

  <p>Bastable's mouth grew a trifle more hard. The note of danger was sounded
  in his ears, and he was ready for the battle. The name of Batter had not been
  mentioned in his hearing for years, but he had not forgotten it.</p>

  <p>"Roger Batter is dead," he said. "Unless you are familiar with this part
  of the world, you could not have known him. It is a romantic story."</p>

  <p>"I know the story," De Lava said, "but I am a stranger here. Batter was
  the man who was supposed to have lost his life crossing the quicksands with a
  large sum of money to avert a bank crisis. The journey as undertaken by
  night, and the stepping-stones were used as the shortest way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by supposed to have met his death?" Bastable
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," De Lava said, sweetly, "if he met with his death I should
  never have known him, and consequently should have been deprived of the
  exquisite pleasure of making your charming acquaintance. I can assure you
  that Batter died penitent. He sincerely repented having robbed his employer
  of all that money. Most of the plunder went elsewhere, but that does not
  detract from the sincerity of Batter's confession. For his trouble he had a
  banknote of five hundred pounds. With this he vanished into space, and the
  story went that he died nobly doing his duty. He lost his nerve to such an
  extent that he never cashed the note, and it found its way into my
  possession. Perhaps you would like to see it."</p>

  <p>De Lava produced a "Bank of Engraving" note, but it served the purpose.
  Bastable waved it aside. It never occurred to him that anybody would dare to
  try on a game like that with him.</p>

  <p>"This is the note," he said. "The others were paid to Mr. Arthur Bowen to
  meet the cost of some property here purchased by&mdash;but really, Mr.
  Bastable, is there any necessity to tell you by whom that property was
  purchased?"</p>

  <p>Bastable pressed the tips of his fingers together and glared at the
  speaker. He was holding himself in with an effort. He was gradually coming to
  recognise the fact that he had a foeman worthy of his steel.</p>

  <p>"You'd better come to the point," he said.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, you English are so practical," De Lava murmured. "Nothing
  will content you but the obvious. It was a rare stroke of fortune when you
  bought the old marshes at the far end of the new town. It was strong evidence
  of your foresight, too."</p>

  <p>"So you mean to suggest that I stole it?" Bastable cried.</p>

  <p>He was on his feet now, prudence flung to the winds. He was swayed by a
  wild desire to fall upon this man and bruise his smiling face. De Lava was
  ready. The struggle was brief and signally one-sided. A moment later Bastable
  lay on his back on the floor, De Lava holding him by the throat. There was a
  livid mark over his left eye, and his lips were cut and bleeding. De Lava was
  as fresh as a daisy.</p>

  <p>"I know you stole the money," he purred gently. "You found out that Batter
  had been robbing the bank and compelled him to join your conspiracy. It was
  an ingenious coup, and you deserved all you earned. I can prove every word of
  what I say, if you desire it. You can get up now, and if you try any more
  brutal violence upon me, I'll break your right arm for you."</p>

  <p>Bastable struggled to his feet. In the whole course of his life he had
  never had such an experience before. He had fought his way to the front, and
  found most people terribly afraid of him. But here was a man who could beat
  him at his own game. He cringed before De Lava.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"For myself, nothing," De Lava said, loftily. "By the way, you had better
  think of some neat way of accounting for the change in your personal
  appearance. I have called on behalf of the family of the late Roger Batter. I
  am raising a subscription for them, and I am sanguine enough to believe you
  will put your name down for five hundred pounds. Now please don't protest.
  Your modest and generous nature shrinks from the publicity that such a
  handsome donation might entail. But be not anxious, my good Bastable&mdash;I
  will see that you remain anonymous."</p>

  <p>Bastable writhed from side to side. Behind De Lava's smile he noted little
  lights in his eyes as hard as steel. With an almost painful effort he dragged
  his cheque-book from a drawer and scribbled the desired amount on it.</p>

  <p>"There!" he mumbled, "take it, you confounded rascal."</p>

  <p>"This is a great pleasure to me," De Lava went on, as if he had heard
  nothing. "I hope to see you frequently at the Red House. By the bye, I forgot
  to say that I will give Sir Horace Amory your name as my reference. Having
  satisfied you as to my bona-fides, you cannot refuse."</p>

  <p>"Get out of my office, you foreign scum!" Bastable roared.</p>

  <p>De Lava went out with a smile. His pride was soothed and flattered.</p>

  <p>"Most excellent," he observed; "but when I saw how easy a conquest I was
  likely to make I wondered at my own moderation. But we shall meet again,
  Bastable."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Really, most kind and thoughtful," De Villier remarked
  again.</p>

  <p>He looked round the room with a pleased smile. Much had been done to
  improve the place in so short a time. There were several pieces of fine old
  furniture in the Red House, and these had been given a prominent position.
  There was a flavour of romance about the whole thing, an Arabian Nights'
  suggestion, that appealed to De Villier.</p>

  <p>"These are very comfortable quarters, Mr. Amory," he said. "This is the
  kind of atmosphere that would reconcile most of us to exile."</p>

  <p>"I have no more to do with it than yourself," Dick said sulkily. "An hour
  ago there wasn't a sign of all this."</p>

  <p>"A pleasant surprise on the part of your friends!" De Villier
  suggested.</p>

  <p>But the joke was lost upon Dick. He was looking anxiously at the table
  before him. He noted the costly wines and the brand on the cigars. What was
  the meaning of it, and who was responsible for it? Certainly nobody had done
  it out of affection for him.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he went on. "Till this day this was the safest
  place to hide in you could imagine. Nobody ever came near the place. Not a
  dozen people in Shoremouth dared pass it after dark. Now it looks like
  becoming a tourist centre. People come here and make a midnight picnic. Of
  course, you can do as you like. As for me, I must not be seen."</p>

  <p>"Is the escapade as serious as that?" De Villier asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a fugitive from justice," Amory said sullenly. "There is no warrant
  out for my arrest, but one may be applied for at any moment. I have taken
  that which does not belong to me, and I did it with my eyes open. That I
  believed in my ability to replace the money when it was needed has nothing to
  do with the question. There are many criminals who do not intend to be
  dishonest at the start."</p>

  <p>Amory spoke with the bitterness of despair. He was realising that Fate was
  against him. Why did these people come and worry him in this way? What was
  the strange fascination that suddenly drew so many people to the Red
  House?</p>

  <p>"You force me to speak like this," Amory concluded.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Lady Amory as he spoke. She had understood every word, and
  was regarding him with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"My poor boy," she said; "oh, my poor boy! You might have known I would
  have helped you if you had only come to me. But now I am powerless. If I only
  had all that I have lost! If only the sands would give up their secret,
  I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off and turned aside. Dick gazed at her in puzzled astonishment.
  She seemed to grasp the situation, to understand his danger and the pressing
  need for assistance. But, from Dick's point of view, the last few words
  betrayed the mind diseased. To his understanding, the secret of the sands
  meant nothing. He could only listen vacuously.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know what to say," De Villier interposed. "If I could be of any
  assistance? You will pardon my selfishness, but I am wet, and if I could
  procure a change&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Amory at any rate could offer that. There was one change of dress in his
  bedroom. De Villier came down presently dry and comfortable, and disposed to
  be pleased with his adventure. He did not appear to notice Amory's anxiety.
  For him the whole affair was a novel experience to be made the most of.</p>

  <p>"Now sit down to this tempting supper," he said. "True, it is not intended
  for us, but what matter? If the worst comes to the worst, we can pay for it.
  I must confess that I should like to meet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Villier paused in his gay chatter. The smile faded from his face, and
  his lips grew hard and his eye stern. Only a plain silver matchbox on the
  shelf had attracted his attention. He stood looking at it with a glare that
  was positively murderous. Then he turned angrily to Lady Amory. She shook her
  head sadly.</p>

  <p>"On second thoughts, we had better go," De Villier said, in a changed
  voice. "I will remain till my car comes. I can explain what has happened to
  the gentlemen who are supping here, and they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't," Ronald said, significantly.</p>

  <p>De Villier threw a quick, questioning glance at him. "You wouldn't?" he
  asked. "I am obliged to you for your warning. But I beg to assure you that I
  am absolutely safe. Can anyone give me a box of ordinary matches?"</p>

  <p>Amory produced the matches. "Here you are," he said. "If you will excuse
  me I will take myself off. It is all very well for you people, but the place
  is not safe for me. If I were in the Duke's place I, too, should regard the
  affair as a joke&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Villier's teeth came together with a click. "There is no joke," he
  said, "unless, perhaps, it is a grim one. But I am glad I came. If you will
  leave me here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Victor, you would not be so rash!" Lady Amory cried.</p>

  <p>"My dear, there is no danger for me. I hold the key of the situation in my
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Your rashness is sinful," Lady Amory went on. "It was always the same
  with you. I implore, I insist that one of these gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden commotion outside, and the door was flung open. Vera
  Amory stood there, her face white and agitated, and her breast heaved
  painfully as if she had run far and fast. There was a hint of alarm in her
  eyes, of fear that had been struggled with but not altogether conquered. A
  long sigh of relief rose tremblingly to her lips. Ronald moved towards her
  tenderly, and anxiously she put her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you only knew the relief of finding you here!" she gasped. "I had
  to come. It was absolutely necessary that somebody should come, and there was
  none I could trust."</p>

  <p>"Something terrible has happened?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so," Vera said. She was recovering from her exhaustion, and
  the colour was creeping back into her cheeks. "I ran all the way. I knew that
  my brother was here, and I guessed that Lady Amory had come, too. Dick, it is
  your father."</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened to him?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"He has had a seizure. He was talking to me quite naturally when the
  stroke came suddenly. Oh, it was horrible! He asked for you, and seemed
  dreadfully anxious to see you about something without delay. Even after the
  doctor came, and he was only partially conscious, he moaned for you. It
  sounded like some business of the last importance. They telephoned for a
  nurse from Shoremouth&mdash;But you must come."</p>

  <p>Dick listened with a miserable and wan face. He was not bad at heart. In
  his selfish way he was fond of his father. Still, this looked like the
  destruction of his elaborate plans for his own safety. He would have to
  appear openly at Oversands, and might even be needed at the bank to-morrow.
  The mere thought of it drove the blood from his face and set him
  trembling.</p>

  <p>Ronald watched this hesitation with impatience and contempt. "There is no
  occasion to say more," he said. "We will all come."</p>

  <p>They departed presently, leaving De Villier alone. He appeared to be very
  busy manipulating the box of matches. Lady Amory lingered a moment to say
  something urgent, but he smiled and shook his head. With a sad expression she
  turned away, and Dick fell back by her side.</p>

  <p>"Why are you hiding, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She spoke normally and sensibly, and appeared to be sane and in full
  possession of her senses. A sudden hope flared up in Dick's heart.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I explain to you?" he whispered. "Let the others go further ahead
  so that they will not overhear us. Aunt Maria, I am in great trouble. I have
  done a foolish&mdash;a wicked and criminal thing if you like. If I don't get
  twenty thousand pounds in the next few days, I shall have to go to gaol. I
  shall not only disgrace the family, but I shall have to suffer imprisonment
  as well. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Your words are perfectly plain," Lady Amory said. "It is dreadful."</p>

  <p>"My dear aunt, you don't know how dreadful. Everybody will talk about it.
  The shame and humiliation will drive my father and sister from Shoremouth. My
  father will help me if he can, but that is impossible. He told me certain
  things a little while ago that opened my eyes to his position. I am sure this
  seizure is connected with money or the need of it. Can't you help us,
  aunt?"</p>

  <p>Lady Amory laid a long slender hand on her jewelled breast. She understood
  what Dick was hinting at, and turned to him a face that was wet with
  tears.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I would gladly do it, if possible," she said. "For your
  sake, I would cheerfully sacrifice my last farthing. I want to make this
  clear so long as my mind is capable of comprehending things. You think I am
  rich&mdash;in reality I am as poor as yourself. I have only a small annuity
  and the furniture in my cottage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, the diamonds!" Dick whispered impatiently. "Those wonderful gems of
  yours! You are wearing enough now to put us on our feet again."</p>

  <p>"Shams," Lady Amory said, mournfully, "shams, every one of them. I had
  them made at a time when the real stones were in my possession; they were
  made as a protection against thieves. But the real stones lie at the bottom
  of the quicksands."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Dick said, incredulously. "You do not
  understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I understand only too well," Lady Amory observed. "I want
  you to believe that what I say is true. Take this!"</p>

  <p>She tore one of the glittering ornaments from her breast, and handed it to
  Dick.</p>

  <p>"Take that!" she said. "Look at it. See how it gleams and sparkles even in
  this light. In the ordinary way it would be worth thousands. Try to sell it;
  ask any dealer what he would give you for it. Perhaps a hundred pounds, as
  the paste is good. Oh, I know you think me mad, but I am sensible enough
  to-night. But I want you to try. You shall have the pick of my jewel-case, if
  you like. It is the only way to convince you."</p>

  <p>She must be mad, Dick thought. Knowing what he knew, he could not credit
  such a story as this. He held in his hand what represented the price of his
  freedom. He would go to London with this and convert it into money. The jewel
  would fetch thousands of pounds, enough to enable him to face the music when
  Bowen's affair came to be investigated.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Amory told the same story that De Villier had listened to. He began
  to understand why the duke was interested in the Red House. So his aunt had
  imposed this ridiculous legend upon De Villier! It was necessary to keep up
  the deception.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," he said; "sorry for your sake as well as mine. What
  strange happenings in so quiet a place as this! Well, I suppose I must face
  the situation and do the best I can for myself."</p>

  <p>Lady Amory smiled at the cheerfulness of the tone. "You are a brave boy,"
  she said. "All will be well with you yet."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Horace lay on his bed indifferent to all that was going
  on around him. He seemed suddenly to have grown an old and feeble man. In
  some mysterious fashion bad news had reached him during the night. Yet
  earlier in the evening Vera had thought him brighter and more cheerful than
  usual.</p>

  <p>He fretfully put aside the suggestions of his nurses and doctor. He spoke
  in a low whisper in words that slurred over one another curiously. He wanted
  his son. He asked for Dick as a tired child asks for its mother. When Dick
  came the doctor gave a sigh of relief. It was greater fortune than he had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"This is a lucky chance," he said. "I never hoped for this. Your
  father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sort of angry snarl rose from the bed. The doctor moved towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Your presence will do Sir Horace far more good than I can," he whispered.
  "He has something on his mind which he is anxious to get rid of. When that is
  done I am sanguine he will sleep. It is the one thing needful."</p>

  <p>With a shamefaced air Dick stood by the bedside. It was impossible to
  believe that this poor wreck was his father. A clearer light shone in Sir
  Horace's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you are here, Dick," he said. "You are a good boy to come so
  quickly. My&mdash;my mind isn't what is was&mdash;I forget things. Find my
  keys. They are in my trousers pocket."</p>

  <p>Dick produced the keys and held them up for his father to see. He smiled
  approvingly.</p>

  <p>"The small key," Sir Horace went on with an effort&mdash;"key of my
  private safe. Left-hand drawer at the bottom&mdash;acceptance in favour of
  John Kennedy&mdash;paid&mdash;forgery."</p>

  <p>He repeated the last word a score of times, as if to impress it upon
  Dick's understanding.</p>

  <p>"Keep it," he went on. "May be useful. That scoundrel
  Bastable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was no more, for Sir Horace had collapsed; his eyes were closed, and
  his face was like death. With a great fear at his heart, Dick summoned the
  doctor. To his relief the latter looked satisfied.</p>

  <p>"No, he's not dead," he whispered; "it's the reaction. I don't want to be
  inquisitive, but Sir Horace told you what he wanted you to know?"</p>

  <p>"Probably he thought so," Dick said. "He seemed to be contented."</p>

  <p>"At any rate, it has done him good. I hope he will get a good night's rest
  now. If he does, he will be much better in the morning. But in cases like
  this one never can tell. He has a good nurse, and I will look in early
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile those in the drawing-room had been waiting anxiously for news.
  The events of the evening had been somewhat trying for Lady Amory, for she
  sat with her hands in her lap and a far-away expression on her face. Vera
  regarded her with uneasiness. At the mention of bed, she rose obediently as a
  child and passed out of the room heedless of anybody. She did not appear to
  see Ronald at all.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know of a more remarkable household?" Vera asked. "Is
  anything like it possible outside of fiction?"</p>

  <p>"Truth is stranger than fiction," Ronald said, awkwardly. "Is Sir Horace
  very ill?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it depends upon what you call illness. I think his trouble is not
  physical at all. Strangely enough, he has not been so cheerful and bright for
  a long time as he was early in the morning. Things have been going badly with
  him lately; indeed, we had contemplated giving up this house. All at once he
  became optimistic. I have never seen my father happier than he was when I
  left him in the dining-room with our guest after dinner. When they came into
  the drawing-room I noticed the change at once. Yet nobody had called, and
  there were no letters. The trouble could not have been caused by anything my
  father heard from the Duc de Villier, because till to-day he was practically
  a stranger to us. Can you help me, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>Ronald warmed at the mention of his name. It was good to feel that Vera
  reposed confidence in him. Nevertheless, he was conscious that he was
  resuming the old tender footing by something like false pretences.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I might be of use," he said. "I am very much afraid that my
  father is at the bottom of all this bother. He has made no secret of his
  dislike for Sir Horace, and has set his heart on getting the land at the
  other side of the river. It is very awkward for me, Vera. There are certain
  so-called business methods that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," Vera said, as Ronald paused. "You were always honourable
  and honest, Ronald. I think I can follow your feelings. Whatever your father
  is, my brother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ronald took Vera's hand in his and pressed it tenderly. "We both have a
  burden to bear," he said. "It is one more bond of sympathy between us."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I hope you won't let your pride stand between our friendship,
  Ronald. What does it matter so long as we can look the world in the face? You
  are an Amory, you always have been an Amory; there is nothing of Bastable
  about you but the name."</p>

  <p>She was smiling into his face, her whole soul in her eyes. She was telling
  Ronald more than she knew. It was very quiet in the drawing-room; the shaded
  lights made a fitting background to it all. With a sudden impulse Ronald
  placed his hand on Vera's shoulder and drew her towards him. He saw the
  dainty red rising to her cheeks, and felt the pressure of her hands in
  his.</p>

  <p>"We understand each other, dearest," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling," Vera said, in a voice so low that Ronald barely caught the
  words. "When I saw you again after the lapse of all those years, it seemed as
  if we had never been parted. Only perhaps you have grown very proud,
  Ronald."</p>

  <p>"Not so proud as I am at this moment," Ronald smiled.</p>

  <p>His arm slipped from Vera's shoulder to her waist. She swayed towards him,
  and as she did so he stooped and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"I should like all the world to see that," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is not the first time," Vera replied. "It has happened before, Ronald.
  But you have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten nothing," Ronald said. "Everything is as clear to me as
  if it had happened yesterday. I have never changed my mind. You were my
  little sweetheart in the old days, and I knew somehow that you would remain
  faithful to me. But those were times&mdash;my father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought we had decided to forget that," Vera said. "And oh,
  Ronald&mdash;how thoughtless and selfish you make me! It was your mention of
  your father. Fancy my talking like this when my father may be&mdash;Really, I
  blush for myself."</p>

  <p>She looked so distressed that Ronald kissed her again. They were still
  talking in low tones when Dick Amory entered. Vera glanced at him
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Is father better?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He has gone to sleep," Dick explained. "It was what the doctor desired;
  he says his patient will be better to-morrow. The nurse is a very capable
  woman, and there is nothing that you can do except go to bed."</p>

  <p>Vera gave a thankful sigh. She was suddenly conscious of feeling
  dreadfully tired. On the whole it had been the most trying evening she had
  ever experienced. But at the end of it she had found her life's
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"I think I will," she said. "I need rest. Good-night, dear."</p>

  <p>She put up her lips for Ronald to kiss. Dick looked on with dull
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's like that, is it?" he asked, when the door had closed. "So it's
  like that? Well, it isn't for me to complain. A chap in my position couldn't
  grumble if his sister chose to marry a decent chimney-sweep. Personally, I'm
  glad. You're a deuced good fellow, Ronald, and the best friend I ever had.
  You're a relation on my mother's side, too. But my father will be against
  it."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us meet trouble half-way," Ronald smiled. "How is Sir
  Horace?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Horace is confoundedly bad. His appearance was a positive shock
  to me. He looked about a hundred years old. But he's worried in his mind. He
  wanted to tell me something, and was under the impression he had done so.
  But, really, I failed to get the hang of it. It was some story connected with
  an acceptance he had given to old Kennedy. This bill must have been duly
  honoured, for I gather that my father has it in his safe. At any rate, he
  told me it was there and gave me his keys."</p>

  <p>"I happen to know something about that," Ronald replied. "Look here, Dick,
  it is as well I should be candid with you. My father and yours are deadly
  enemies. My father wants to compel Sir Horace to sell the land across the
  river for a golf links. As old Kennedy's trustee, he knew all about the
  acceptance. He was going to hold his hand to the last moment, and then force
  Sir Horace to pay or issue a writ. I thought it mean and dishonourable, and
  warned Sir Horace of what was going on. Well, he knew the money had to be
  found; he found it."</p>

  <p>"But he said something about a forgery," Dick said.</p>

  <p>Ronald's face grew pale. A haunting fear possessed him. He was seeing more
  in this than was clear to Dick Amory.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that he said the bill was a forgery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That was about the size of it, so far as I could gather. The acceptance
  was a forgery. But that only complicates matters. Why should your father, who
  has had a business training, be such a fool as to pay 20,000 to meet a bill
  that was a forgery? That is what we shall have to find out. The more I think
  over this affair, the more puzzled I am. We seem to be surrounded by an
  atmosphere of mystery. What are these people doing at the Red House? What is
  the connection between them and my aunt? Again, what is the significance of
  those matches which one is always coming across at the Red House? And now
  Lady Amory tells me she has no jewels at all, and that her gems are at the
  bottom of the quicksands. Upon my word it is enough to turn one's brain."</p>

  <p>But Ronald was only following this vaguely. His mind was fixed upon that
  part of Dick's story which dealt with the acceptance drawn in favour of old
  John Kennedy. How could the thing be a forgery? Sir Horace must be wandering
  in his mind. His troubles had been too much for him, and his brain had given
  way. It was notorious that association with lunacy is a dangerous thing, and
  constant contact with Lady Amory had not been without its effect.</p>

  <p>"Can you see to the bottom of it?" Dick asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"At present, no," Ronald replied. "I am as much in the dark as you.
  Possibly my father may be able to throw some light on the matter. You need
  not be afraid that I shall say anything calculated to do you harm. You will
  go down to the bank to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>Amory nodded moodily. He was busy thinking of his own trouble again.</p>

  <p>"I must," he said. "Everybody will know in a few hours that I am back
  again. It's a risk, but I can see no way out of it. I shall have to run up to
  London in the evening on a matter of business, but I shall be back next
  day."</p>

  <p>Ronald looked at the clock. It was long past midnight, and he was getting
  tired. Besides, he wanted to be alone to think over the recent complication.
  He wanted to try to puzzle out what his father was doing in the matter. He
  reached the road presently which connected the main way to Shoremouth with
  the path to the quicksands and the Red House. As he reached the spot a man
  passed him walking towards the town. There was something familiar about the
  figure, and Ronald hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Kite!" he called out.</p>

  <p>Kite faced round suddenly and recognised Ronald in his turn.</p>

  <p>"The same, sir," he said. "Odd we should meet like this. But I had
  forgotten that your home is here."</p>

  <p>"I presume that you have come on business?" Ronald suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Kite said, guardedly, "and a business in which you are
  interested. I have come to arrest a man on a charge of being concerned in the
  kidnapping of Mr. Bowen. The man I want calls himself Count Henri de
  Lava."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Amory woke next morning to a full understanding of his
  responsibilities. The sense of misery and anxiety lay heavy upon him. He was
  feeling nothing in the way of remorse or regret, and was thinking only of
  himself, and how he could get out of his troubles. Like most sanguine
  spirits, he had a plan of escape, and was inclined to doubt the truth of Lady
  Amory's statement as to the fate of the jewels. The poor woman was mad, and
  had not the least idea what she was talking about. It was a delusion of hers
  that the priceless gems had been cast into the maw of the quicksands. She
  firmly believed such was the case, but she must be in error.</p>

  <p>Dick stood before the window in his dressing-room holding the diamond his
  aunt had given him up to the light. He was no judge of such things, though he
  flattered himself that he knew enough to tell the true from the false. How
  the thing flashed and glittered, how deep was the blue and yellow flame that
  lay in its depths. Surely an expert would not hesitate to pronounce it
  genuine.</p>

  <p>Still, Lady Amory's story had sounded natural enough as she told it. The
  Duc de Villier, too, was familiar with all these details; but, with his
  sanguine temperament, Dick was enamoured of his own theory. He had come to
  believe that he held in his hand the key to the door that would lead him past
  all his troubles. He would sell the beautiful thing for a large sum of
  money.</p>

  <p>He went down to breakfast presently in quite an amiable frame of mind.
  Vera was seated in the morning-room awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"How's the governor!" Dick asked, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Better, they say," Vera replied. "He does not seem so anxious this
  morning, and is inclined to sleep a great deal. The nurse thinks we had
  better keep out of his room as much as possible. I fancy he is going on all
  right. But it is a very miserable state of affairs."</p>

  <p>"I daresay it will all come right," Dick said, cheerfully. "After all, the
  governor is much better off than I am."</p>

  <p>A look of pain and reproach crossed Vera's face. "Why do you talk like
  that?" she asked. "Have you no shame? Anybody might think you were proud to
  find yourself in your present position. Surely we have trouble enough as it
  is."</p>

  <p>Dick helped himself to more ham. "Don't worry about me," he said. "Give me
  another cup of coffee. I shall be all right. In fact, I am clear now."</p>

  <p>In spite of her anxiety, Vera could not repress a smile. "Always the
  same," she said&mdash;"always doing silly things and hoping to escape the
  consequences. How can your position have improved since last night?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it has," Dick said, with a lapse into his sullen manner. "I have
  had a slice of good luck, though it is too early to speak of it yet. Don't
  worry about me, Vera&mdash;I will bring no disgrace on the family. From what
  I saw last night, you will have your own hands pretty full before long."</p>

  <p>The hot blood flamed into Vera's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You are alluding to Ronald Bastable?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. What will the governor say when he hears you are going to
  marry the son of his old servant, Joe Bastable? Bastable the
  bounder&mdash;Bastable who, under another name, is one of the most notorious
  money-lending bloodsuckers in England! Oh, I know that because I have been in
  the brute's clutches myself."</p>

  <p>Vera listened calmly. Joseph Bastable could be no worse than she imagined
  him to be. But Ronald's father had nothing to do with the matter. The
  misfortune was Ronald's, and she loved him the more for it.</p>

  <p>"It is a question that I shall decide for myself," she said, quietly.
  "There is disgrace on both sides of the family."</p>

  <p>Dick said no more. He was feeling less elated as he made his way into
  Shoremouth. He was greeted on all sides by acquaintances anxious to hear the
  latest bulletin about Sir Horace. Others, of the boon-companion type, were
  curious to know why Dick had not been home for so long. Strange stories were
  afloat in connection with Dick and the "Safe Mystery." He was feeling more
  and more uncomfortable and alarmed as he reached the bank. The chief cashier,
  a man who had grown grey in the service of the Amorys, greeted him somewhat
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"What can we do for you, Mr. Richard?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be alarmed, Pemberton," Dick said, airily. "You need not be
  afraid that I came here to loot the safe. My father thought it would be as
  well for one of us to be about the premises. I won't interfere with you. To
  be quite candid, I came to get a paper from the governor's safe. I suppose
  you have no objection to that?"</p>

  <p>Old Pemberton began to feel easier in his mind. "Certainly not, Mr.
  Richard," he said. "I hope Sir Horace is better?"</p>

  <p>Dick swaggered into the private office, and proceeded to overhaul the
  safe, but every drawer had its own particular key, and Dick could only open
  one of them. In it lay a strip of oblong blue paper, which Dick regarded with
  intense curiosity. It was the acceptance for 20,000 drawn in favour of John
  Kennedy, and duly cancelled on behalf of his bankers. Dick wondered why his
  father had kept this, seeing that it had been paid. What had Sir Horace meant
  when he said that the bill was a forgery? As a business man he would not have
  parted with so valuable a consideration as 20,000 for a forgery. There was
  nothing of the diplomat about him, either. He was the last man in the world
  to plot and scheme, or even intrigue for his own advantage.</p>

  <p>Dick turned the blue strip over and over in his hands. He was a great fool
  in some matters, especially where money was concerned, but in the matter of
  trickery and cunning he had little to learn; he had lived too long in the
  wrong set for that. In his own language, he prided himself as being up to
  every move on the board.</p>

  <p>The puzzled expression on his face gave way presently to a smile. The bill
  was dated six months before, as Dick saw at a glance. As his eye fell on the
  inland revenue stamp in the corner he smiled again. He placed the strip of
  paper carefully away in his pocket-book and reached for his hat. A few
  moments later and he was in the rival bank asking for the favour of a few
  moments' interview with Mr. Bastable.</p>

  <p>Bastable sprawled in his chair, a grim smile on his coarse, red face.
  "This is an unexpected pleasure," he said. "Why do you want to see me? Are
  you trying to arrange for bail in the early future? Do you expect me to
  become security for you when you make your appearance before the London
  magistrate?"</p>

  <p>The brutal sneer passed over Dick's head. In the ordinary way he was
  horribly afraid of the man, but not to-day. He had too much confidence in the
  weapon he carried. He felt like the man who matches a revolver against a
  club.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of that," he said. "But your mention of the word
  security gives me an idea. I want to borrow some money. Would De la Pole be
  any good?"</p>

  <p>Bastable's face darkened. "What do you mean by that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know what I mean well enough. I've found you out, Bastable. It's
  not a bit of use to tell me a parcel of lies. What a fine piece of scandal
  for Shoremouth! To think that that pillar of respectability, Joe Bastable,
  should be one and the same person as De la Pole, the poisonous scamp who has
  been lashed in every newspaper in England! Fancy the Mayor-elect of
  Shoremouth lending money at 100 per cent., and robbing poor wretched clerks
  of fees for advances he never meant to make. Upon my word, I'm paying you a
  compliment by speaking to you at all."</p>

  <p>The veins stood out like cords on Bastable's forehead. He made a movement
  in Dick's direction. The latter smiled as he watched him.</p>

  <p>"None of that," he said; "none of that, or it will be the worse for you.
  Upon my word, it's lucky you have a son like Ronald. If it hadn't been for
  him this story would have been all over Shoremouth long ago."</p>

  <p>Bastable dropped back in his seat again. This, clearly, was a case when
  his blustering, bullying methods would be useless. Nothing short of murder
  would suffice.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to proceed against you for criminal libel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Rather!" Dick retorted. "Nothing would please me better. I am able to
  prove every word that I say. You have ruined me, and if I go down you will go
  down too. With all your brag and impudence, you would not dare to show your
  face in Shoremouth if this came out. This is not the worst&mdash;that is not
  the worst, Joseph Bastable."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so there is something more?" Bastable said, sourly. "Let me hear
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you some of it. I've been going over a few of my father's
  papers&mdash;at his request, mind&mdash;and found an acceptance drawn in
  favour of old Kennedy by my father for 20,000. Now, my father is not well
  enough at present to be worried with business, but it strikes me as a strange
  thing that Sir Horace should redeem a bill drawn and accepted six months ago
  on a bill stamp dated only six weeks since!"</p>

  <p>Bastable leaped to his feet. A startled expression escaped his lips. For
  the moment he had forgotten himself. He was a flame of madness, intoxicated
  with fury, longing to have the fool responsible for this by the throat and
  choke the life out of him. But with it all he was raging with impatience at
  himself.</p>

  <p>"John Turk!" he roared. "Oh, John Turk, if I had you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he paused. What insanity possessed him this morning! He was actually
  making matters a thousand times worse! And this fool of an Amory was sitting
  opposite to him with frank enjoyment of the situation. He forced himself to
  be calm, to summon a smile to his face. The effort sent the blood humming
  through his veins and brought a mist before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look at the bill?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think not," Dick said, calmly. "The bill is safe. Perhaps I have made a
  mountain out of a molehill, perhaps not."</p>

  <p>"If you would allow me to help you," Bastable began,
  "possibly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No need, Bastable, no need," Dick said, loftily. "My affairs are in an
  exceedingly prosperous condition. When I am in pressing need of money I will
  obtain assistance from that genial philanthropist, Godfrey de la Pole."</p>

  <p>With this parting shot, Dick swung out of the office. Not for a long time
  past had he been on such good terms with himself. As he turned into the
  High-street he saw little knots of people gathered together eagerly
  discussing some matter. He detached an acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he asked. "Someone been murdered?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like it," the other said. "They tell me that the dead body of a
  man has been found in the Red House. No details at present."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Ronald had been looking forward to a good night's rest, for
  he had had a trying time of it lately. But all desire that way vanished now.
  He was instantly alert again. A peculiar smile trembled on his lips. There
  was comedy as well as tragedy in the situation, though Kite was not aware of
  the fact. In connection with the disappearance of Bowen, Ronald had a theory
  of his own, but on this point he had not yet said anything. Neither did he
  intend to enlighten Kite at that moment.</p>

  <p>"You think that De Lava is at the bottom of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I fancy so; in fact, I am pretty sure of it," Kite replied. "De Lava is a
  man whom we have had under observation for some time. Our attention was first
  drawn to him by the Italian police. He comes from Sicily, and is of a very
  good family. He was mixed up in one of those blood feuds which are still a
  feature of the island, and only his family influence saved him. He is
  implicated in more than one murder, but in Sicily these things are hardly
  recognised as capital crimes. Finally, De Lava had to fly when the influence
  of his party waned and his opponents came out on top. He is an extravagant
  fellow, and needs a deal of money, and is not in the least particular as to
  how he gets it. We believe that he is the instigator of several successful
  swindles of late, but have not been able to bring them home to him."</p>

  <p>"How do you identify him with the Bowen affair?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"By a piece of carelessness on his part," Kite explained. "It is strange
  how careless the most cunning criminal can be at times. They are a vain lot,
  as a rule, and this is one of the greatest assets in our favour. The man is
  fond of jewellery."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled. He had noticed that, indeed, it was De Lava's weakness for
  jewellery that had led him on the right track from the first.</p>

  <p>"He has a wonderful diamond and ruby marquise ring," he said.</p>

  <p>"Precisely what we noticed," Kite answered. "It seems almost incredible,
  doesn't it? Here is a distinguished criminal who labels himself in this
  fashion all because he cannot resist the temptation to make a display. If you
  remember, the man who was seen in Bowen's office on the day he disappeared
  was wearing a marquise ring. The fact gets into the papers, and yet De Lava
  is not warned. He is subsequently seen in a fashionable West End restaurant
  wearing the ring, and the fact comes to our ears. Naturally we keep an eye
  upon him and make inquiries. The inquiries lead us down here, where we find
  him staying at a good hotel with a companion called Sexton."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything against Sexton?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"Not so far as we know at present," Kite went on. "Sexton may be one of
  his victims, though personally I doubt it. I fancy we shall find him in his
  hotel. Come!"</p>

  <p>Sexton was seated in the depths of an armchair reading a book when the
  unexpected guests entered. He jumped to his feet, pale and agitated. His eyes
  blinked behind his glasses in a helpless manner; his face was ghastly and wet
  with terror.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what is the meaning of this?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>The attempt at bluster was poor enough, for he was shaking from head to
  foot.</p>

  <p>"It is a liberty, sir," Kite said, smoothly. "But there is no help for it.
  I am here from Scotland Yard, and my name is Kite."</p>

  <p>Sexton collapsed into his chair. There was something pitiable in his
  efforts to keep his features under control.</p>

  <p>"What has that to do with me?" he demanded. "My name is Sexton,
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am well aware of that," Kite went on. "Now, sir, you can save yourself
  much unpleasantness if you will be guided by me. You are the friend of Count
  de Lava, and, therefore, we regard you with some suspicion. In fact, I am
  here to arrest Count Henri de Lava."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" Sexton stammered. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"On suspicion of being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Arthur Bowen,
  the solicitor. We believe he was the man who kidnapped that gentleman."</p>

  <p>Sexton suddenly ceased to tremble and shiver. The twitching of his muscles
  ceased, and the colour crept slowly back into his cheeks. Something like a
  laugh broke from his lips. The laugh became more and more pronounced, till
  finally he threw his head backwards and roared with amusement. The subtlety
  of the exquisite joke brought tears into his eyes. Then he grew grave as he
  saw the other regarding him intently.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," he gasped. "Really, I apologise for my
  rudeness. But the thing is so comical. The idea of De Lava being mixed up in
  a matter like that tickles me. How the count will enjoy it!"</p>

  <p>"He shall have the opportunity," Kite said. "The whole thing may seem
  absurd, but I am pretty sure of my ground. I am so sure of my ground that
  unless you give me every assistance I shall arrest you on suspicion of being
  an accomplice."</p>

  <p>Sexton's mood changed abruptly. He was showing signs of terror again.</p>

  <p>"Once more I beg your pardon," he said. "I see you are serious. The count
  is at the Red House. He has taken the place for some experiments, or he means
  to take it. Any tenant would be welcomed, I should say. He is there now. I
  will accompany you, if you like, and you shall be convinced from his own lips
  what a mistake you have made. Late as it is, I will go with you."</p>

  <p>Sexton fussed into his hat and coat with an air of importance. He appeared
  to be restless and excited, and chatted in a nervous manner as he strode
  along with the others. But he was quiet by the time the Red House was
  reached. From the edge of one of the windows a long thin stream of light
  gleamed, and voices could be heard within as the three approached. For the
  first time Sexton hung back and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better let me go first and prepare the count," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Can't do it," Kite said, curtly. "Out of the question altogether. I have
  not come to take risks of that kind, Mr. Sexton."</p>

  <p>Sexton began to bluster again between teeth that chattered. The voices
  inside the house grew louder and more threatening, as if a quarrel were in
  progress. Then came a shout and a curse, following a blow that was succeeded
  by the quick cry of a man sorely pressed, and almost immediately the light in
  the dining-room vanished. A figure dashed from the back of the house towards
  the sandhills.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" Kite yelled. "He's got the tip somehow. He'll escape us."</p>

  <p>"Better search the house first," Ronald suggested. "It's too dark, and he
  is too far away by this time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He struck a match as he spoke and entered the dining-room. The lamp had
  been upset, but the pair of candles stood on the mantelshelf. A dark figure
  lay huddled on the floor.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," Kite muttered. "Looks as if he had escaped us
  after all."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">SEXTON stood shivering and evidently anxious to be gone. But
  Kite fixed a cold eye upon him, and he changed his mind. Ronald proceeded to
  light the lamp. The blaze flooded the room and picked out every object
  distinctly. So far as Ronald could see, the table had not been disturbed.
  Certainly nobody had supped there, for the plates were still clean, and the
  silver and cutlery lay in order by their sides. But the lamp had been upset,
  one or two broken glasses lay about, and a box of matches had been spilt upon
  the floor.</p>

  <p>In front of the fireplace a figure lay flat on his back with hands to the
  sides. A plain steel dagger was plunged to the hilt in the unfortunate man's
  heart, and just under it lay five matches disposed in the form of a dagger.
  Ronald wondered where he had seen this sign before. It flashed across him
  presently.</p>

  <p>"This is the man you have been looking for," Ronald whispered.</p>

  <p>Kite gazed coolly into the dead man's face.</p>

  <p>"I must take your word for it, sir," he said. "As a matter of fact, I had
  never seen the man. But the ring is there all right."</p>

  <p>He indicated De Lava's hand, where the marquise ring sparkled in the
  lamplight. Sexton groaned and turned away his head. Ronald pointed
  significantly to the neatly arranged matches on the dead man's breast.</p>

  <p>"Do these things convey anything to you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Look strange, don't they?" Kite replied. "Sort of thing you read of in
  sensational stories. Very ingenious, though. Much better than elaborate signs
  that cost money and are not easily procurable. Now, matches can be obtained
  anywhere, and, moreover, are not calculated to attract attention."</p>

  <p>"That arrangement is," Ronald said.</p>

  <p>"Meant to do so," Kite said, professionally. "It is a hint that the
  society has accomplished its work. Certain to get into the papers and so
  advertise headquarters, thereby saving the despatch of dangerous letters. It
  also serves as a warning to members likely to kick against the
  authorities."</p>

  <p>"You think some secret society has been at work?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it. In fact, I can tell you the name of the society. It is
  the Red Section of the Knights of Antonia, in Sicily. There are two sections,
  the Red and the Blue, and each is sworn to wipe the other out. It isn't a bad
  notion, for it saves the police trouble, and these ruffians are ridding the
  island of themselves by a process of gradual extinction. I studied the whole
  matter years ago in Paris, and am rather an authority at this kind of thing.
  De Lava was a traitor to his section. This is the traitor's sign over his
  heart. But we are wasting time."</p>

  <p>"The criminals are not far off," Ronald suggested.</p>

  <p>"They are far enough off for all practical purposes," Kite said. "We shall
  never lay hands upon them, and, between ourselves, we don't trouble ourselves
  excessively in such cases. From our point of view, villains like De Lava are
  best removed."</p>

  <p>He bent down coolly and began to search De Lava's pockets. He produced a
  purse with a little money, an empty pocket-book, and lastly a bundle of
  letters, which mostly consisted of unpaid bills, applications for money, and
  a loose cheque carelessly folded. Kite raised his eyebrows as he looked at
  the pink slip, which he handed to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"The count does not seem to be a total stranger here," he said. "Will you
  be good enough to tell me who drew this cheque, Mr. Bastable?"</p>

  <p>Ronald stood open-mouthed with the draft in his hand.</p>

  <p>"My father," he exclaimed. "A cheque for five hundred pounds!
  Extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>Kite turned at a cry from Sexton. It sounded like a cry of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to say, Mr. Sexton?" the officer asked politely.</p>

  <p>"I was only surprised," Sexton said. "De Lava should have paid that cheque
  into his account as soon as he got it. I know that he was overdrawn, and that
  he had given a cheque for our hotel bill knowing there were no funds to meet
  it. I have known him do a stupid thing like that more than once."</p>

  <p>"The count was an old friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I have known him for some years. We met in a business way."</p>

  <p>"Then probably you know something about this affair. Can you tell us how
  he comes to have Mr. Bastable's cheque in his pocket? Unless it is a
  forgery."</p>

  <p>"It is no forgery," Sexton cried, angrily. "I am certain of that. As to
  the rest, I can tell you nothing. I know De Lava had&mdash;had some dealings
  with Mr. Bastable, and he told me he had money to come."</p>

  <p>Ronald listened unconvinced. He did not believe the man was telling the
  truth; at any rate, he was concealing something. He had an uncomfortable
  feeling, however, that his father could throw light upon this fresh mystery.
  Kite, on the other hand, appeared to be satisfied, for he was examining the
  letters he had taken from De Lava's pocket. One of them seemed to interest
  him greatly.</p>

  <p>"I have a few more questions to ask you," he said, turning to Sexton. "I
  have already told you why I had made up my mind to arrest Count de Lava. He
  was wanted in connection with the disappearance of Bowen, the solicitor. Now,
  will you be so good as to cast your eye over this telegram? I presume that it
  comes from you?"</p>

  <p>Sexton took the flimsy paper in his hand. It was brief and to the
  point:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    "Wednesday at 1.15 sharp.<br>
    Both out of the way.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Sexton.</b>"<br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>"Do you remember sending that telegram?" Kite asked.</p>

  <p>Sexton fumbled the paper in his shaky fingers, and glanced suspiciously at
  Kite. Evidently he suspected some trap. Inwardly he was cursing the folly of
  De Lava in keeping such useless but highly incriminating documents. Still,
  his name appeared on it, and denial would be futile.</p>

  <p>"I sent it," he said, as if the words were dragged from him. "I&mdash;I
  forget what it was about. Some little matter of business probably. Surely
  there is no harm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, there is no harm," Kite went on casually. "But, you see, it was on
  Wednesday that Bowen was kidnapped from his office, and the time was
  a-quarter past one as near as possible. Both clerks were out of the way. I
  may be wrong, but that is my reading of the message. It may be more than a
  mere coincidence. But it is enough to justify me in detaining you on
  suspicion of being concerned in the abduction from Ivy Court."</p>

  <p>Sexton smiled, much as he had smiled an hour ago in his private
  sitting-room in the hotel. A similar cackle of hysterical laughter broke from
  his lips. Then he grew grave once more. The situation was sufficiently
  serious.</p>

  <p>"You are wrong, inspector," he said. "If Mr. Bowen ever turns up again he
  will exonerate me at once. He is an old friend, and would do anything for me.
  That telegram is only a coincidence."</p>

  <p>But Kite was not listening. He was reading one of the letters. There was
  just the trace of a smile on his face as he finished.</p>

  <p>"It's no good, Mr. Sexton," he said. "The more I go into the affair the
  blacker it looks against you. Now, glance at this letter."</p>

  <p>Sexton did so. As his eyes fell on the sheet he groaned and staggered. He
  gave a gesture towards the inspector as if asking him to read the letter
  aloud.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will," Kite said. "Now listen to this, please."</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    "'Dear De Lava,<br>
    <br>
    "'Wednesday will do capitally. I have left all the details to you so far as
    your end of the business is concerned. One of the clerks will be sent off
    into the country, so that he cannot be back till lunch at one and does not
    return for an hour. So there will be ample time for everything. Your scheme
    as to the van is excellent. There is an audacity about the thing that is
    certain to make for success. This strikes me as being better than anything
    underhanded. The trouble will be the safe, but your plan of grappling with
    that is great.<br>
    <br>
    "'I shall wait for you as arranged, but in case of accident don't move till
    you get a wire from me, one never can quite foresee everything. I'll
    telegraph on Tuesday evening if everything is going properly. After that,
    we can make for Shoremouth and try your scheme for recovering&mdash;you
    know what.<br>
    <br>
    <b>YOURS, SEXTON.</b>'"<br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>Sexton lost all control of himself. "The fool! The idiot!" he burst out.
  "De Lava must have been drunk or mad. Nobody but a madman would have carried
  a letter like that in his pocket. Inspector, it is useless to make further
  protest. I see you mean to arrest me for a presumed share in the kidnapping
  of Mr. Bowen, and, from your point of view, you can do nothing else. But I am
  prepared to swear that you are making a mistake, seeing that a man could
  hardly&mdash;but no matter."</p>

  <p>Sexton dropped sulkily into a chair. Yet moody and despondent as he was,
  ever and again a grin spread over his face, and he seemed to have much
  difficulty in concealing some queer form of amusement. Ronald watched him in
  a puzzled way.</p>

  <p>"Not much use staying here," Kite said. "Even if I search the house, I
  shall find no trace of the criminals. I'll lock up the place and inform the
  police in Shoremouth. I'll ask them to send a couple of men here. I am sorry
  to have to detain you, Mr. Sexton, but my duty is plain."</p>

  <p>Sexton rose with a groan. Once more the convulsive grin galvanised his
  gloomy face into life. Then he sighed dismally as he followed. A sleepy
  sergeant of police at Shoremouth grew alert and vigilant as he listened to
  Kite's story. A couple of men should be despatched to the Red House at once,
  he promised.</p>

  <p>"And you had better come this way," he remarked to Sexton.</p>

  <p>Sexton saw nothing for it but to comply. He found himself presently in a
  narrow cell with a bed in one corner. Certain things he asked were provided.
  Was it too late to write a letter?</p>

  <p>"You can write a letter," the sergeant said. "I'll get it delivered for
  you in the morning. You need not be afraid of its being opened. You are not a
  prisoner yet, you are merely detained on suspicion."</p>

  <p>For some time Sexton scribbled away at his letter, with many a dash and
  underlined words, and then handed it to the officer.</p>

  <p>"If you can have that delivered by breakfast time, I shall be obliged," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The officer took the letter and withdrew. He whistled as he read the name
  on the envelope. The note was addressed to Richard Amory, Esquire, and marked
  "Urgent."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Amory came down to breakfast with a feeling that the
  world was by no means so bleak and barren a place as he had thought it. It
  was a pleasing reflection that he had got the better of so astute a person as
  Joseph Bastable. He had the whip hand of that gentleman, and might compel him
  to help him out of some of his most pressing difficulties.</p>

  <p>It was rather late, and he had the breakfast-room to himself. His father
  was better, but still very queer and misty in his head, so that it was deemed
  advisable to keep him from seeing anybody for the present. It was a great
  nuisance, of course, from Dick's point of view, especially as he would have
  liked a little more light on that forged acceptance. It was a good weapon,
  but it might so easily be made into a better.</p>

  <p>But, on the whole, Dick tackled breakfast with a keen appetite. The
  healthy pangs vanished, however, and the upraised coffee-cup clattered into
  the saucer, as Dick caught sight of a letter by his plate. The mere
  handwriting struck a cold chill to his heart.</p>

  <p>"More worries!" he muttered. "What's amiss now?"</p>

  <p>With shaking fingers he tore off the cover. It needed no foresight to tell
  him that this was bad news, but he was not prepared for the stunning gravity
  of it. He read the letter again and again until its full import came home to
  him. He pushed his now useless plate aside, and planted his head on both his
  upturned hands.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, what a complication!" he groaned. "Now, who could have
  foreseen such a hideous muddle as this? It makes one cold even to think of
  it. And yet, upon my word, I never heard of anything more amusing in the
  wildest farce. If it were anybody else's case it would tickle me to death.
  But I shall have to go&mdash;I shall have to go, if only for my own
  sake."</p>

  <p>With an air of insolence and swagger not too easily affected, Amory called
  at the police station an hour later and asked to see Mr. Sexton. The
  interview was a long one, and when it was over he left hurriedly for
  London.</p>

  <p>Dick breathed more easily as he neared London. He was glad to get away
  from Shoremouth if only for a few hours. There were particular reasons why he
  wanted to be beyond the reach of Mr. Sexton. After he had transacted his
  business, he wrote his letters and spent half an hour at his club. Then he
  called a taxi-cab and drove to one of the leading jewellers in Bond-street.
  He lounged into the private office with the air of a customer of
  importance.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, sir?" the proprietor asked.</p>

  <p>Dick produced the paste ornament from his pockets. "This belongs to my
  aunt, Lady Amory," he said. "I am Mr. Richard Amory. I shall be glad if you
  will make a close examination of this and tell me what it will cost to
  duplicate it. My aunt may need a copy."</p>

  <p>The jeweller took the ornament to the light. He came back presently and
  deposited it on the table before him tenderly and cautiously.</p>

  <p>"We could do it, sir," he said, "for 11,000. These are very fine stones.
  They would not be very easy to match."</p>

  <p>"As much as that?" Dick gasped.</p>

  <p>"Quite, sir. I would give 10,000 for the stones as they stand, and should
  consider I had made a good deal with you."</p>

  <p>Dazed and stunned, and yet wildly jubilant, Dick stumbled out of the shop
  a few minutes later. His voice shook as he spoke to the driver.</p>

  <p>"Attenborough's," he said, huskily. "Go to the nearest branch. What a
  piece of luck, to be sure!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The inquest on the body of Count Henri de Lava was fixed for four o'clock
  at the Town Hall. The room was full when Bastable got there, but people made
  way for him instantly. Perhaps they knew that he would push by them in any
  case. The inquiry had already begun when he took his seat at the solicitor's
  table. Inspector Kite was giving evidence.</p>

  <p>"I came here on business connected with the deceased," he said. "In fact,
  I came to arrest Count Henri de Lava."</p>

  <p>"In connection with another matter?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, sir," Kite went on. "I had reason to believe that the Count
  was concerned in the 'Safe' affair&mdash;I mean the strange disappearance of
  Mr. Arthur Bowen, the London solicitor who was kidnapped from his office in
  Ivy Court."</p>

  <p>"Does one matter involve the other?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, sir. It may be remembered that one of the men
  suspected of being in the 'Safe' case wore a peculiar diamond and ruby
  marquise ring. The deceased had a ring of precisely the same pattern. The
  count was also mixed up with a set of Continental criminals of the worst
  type. But it was the ring that gave us the clue. I have it in my pocket.
  Would you like to see it, sir?"</p>

  <p>The coroner was curious. Ronald Bastable handled the ring as he passed it
  up to the presiding official. One glance was enough for him&mdash;it was the
  very image, the twin brother, so to speak, of the ring worn by Lady Amory. No
  doubt there were two of them, but it would be time enough later to go into
  that matter.</p>

  <p>"I took the ring from the finger of the dead man," Kite went on. "I
  removed it as he lay on the floor of the dining-room in the Red House. There
  were papers in the pocket of the count that justified my belief that he was
  connected with the disappearance of Mr. Bowen. One of these letters and a
  telegram were from Mr. Sexton."</p>

  <p>"Who is Mr. Sexton?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"A friend and ally of the count's," Kite proceeded to explain. "This
  gentleman is being detained on suspicion of being connected with the same
  case. In the interests of justice, I should object to the documents being
  made public just yet, but I should like you to see them, sir."</p>

  <p>The coroner perused the letters gravely. "Quite right, Inspector Kite," he
  said. "Your justification is well established. I suppose there was no
  suggestion of any quarrel between the dead man and
  Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sexton. No, sir. Mr. Sexton was with us when we found the body. I have
  every reason to believe the crime is the work of a foreign secret society. I
  think that I shall be able to prove that to your satisfaction. The count had
  been stabbed to the heart with a dagger, which I produce. On the breast,
  immediately below the wound, I found the sign of the society. I am well
  posted in that kind of thing, and shall be glad to explain to you, sir. I
  should like a box of matches."</p>

  <p>The excited spectators were getting good value for their attendance. They
  followed Kite's story and his exposition with the five matches breathlessly.
  This was something which would fill the daily papers to-morrow. The
  excitement became still more intense when at length Kite stood down and
  Joseph Bastable was called.</p>

  <p>He stood there, big, important, and inclined to be defiant. The coroner
  was holding a pink slip of paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to trouble you, Mr. Bastable," he said, "but it seems that you
  can give us some information concerning this strange case. This cheque was
  found in the pocket of the dead man. It appears to bear your signature. Did
  you sign it, or is it a forgery?"</p>

  <p>Bastable hesitated a moment. The coroner was offering him an exceedingly
  simple way out. It would be easy to deny his handwriting. Nobody could prove
  anything to the contrary. But Sexton was sitting there looking on eagerly.
  Unfortunately, it was impossible to guess how much Sexton knew. There was
  nothing for it but an ingenious story.</p>

  <p>"It is my cheque," Bastable said. A story flashed into his mind. "Whatever
  the count may have been otherwise, he was a clever scientist. He came to me
  with plans for a new aeroplane. I was interested, and consented to find some
  money for further experiments. That is the history of the cheque."</p>

  <p>It sounded simple and convincing. The spectators were frankly
  disappointed. They had expected something more than this. One two more
  questions of no significance from the coroner, and Joseph Bastable stepped
  down. He thought he had got out of it easier than he had expected. In
  addition he had his money back. Still, he would have felt more contented and
  easier in his mind had he not noticed the uneasy grin on Sexton's face. The
  latter was smiling as if something amused him greatly.</p>

  <p>Excitement began to rise again as Ronald came forward. It occurred to more
  than one of the audience how strange it was that both father and son should
  be involved in the affair. But nothing very sensational was to be got out of
  Ronald, after all. To a great extent he could do no more than corroborate
  Inspector Kite's evidence. When he left the witness-box he took a seat by his
  father's side, at Bastable's instigation.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well," the latter growled. "Of course, this business does
  not affect us in other ways, but I should like to know how you got in touch
  with this fellow Kite. You seem to have been knocking about with him day and
  night, as if you were in the profession yourself. I should like to know what
  it has to do with you."</p>

  <p>Ronald shook his head politely but firmly. "That I cannot tell you at
  present," he said. "I am concerned for a friend who prefers not to appear
  just now. You shall know everything in good time father. But there is more
  here than meets the eye, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Bastable was not listening. Above the murmurs of voices a name struck
  on his ear&mdash;a name that he had forgotten years ago. It struck him almost
  with the force of a blow. It appealed to him all the more because it came
  from Kite's lips. The coroner stared unaffectedly. He was a local man, and
  for years had been au fait in local affairs.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand, inspector," he said. "You said that you
  proposed to call another witness who would tell us something of the actual
  crime. Did you say Josiah Batter?"</p>

  <p>The audience broke out into loud murmurs of astonishment. Josiah Batter
  had been dead for years. He had died in the service of Amory's Bank. He was a
  sort of hero in his way.</p>

  <p>"That is the name, sir," Kite said. "I had the statement from his own lips
  this morning. Call Josiah Batter."</p>

  <p>The name resounded through the room. It sounded weird and strange to the
  people to whom the name had long been only a memory. Bastable stared with
  hard, dry eyes at that part of the crowd where stir and movement were going
  on. Then there emerged a little man, broken and grey, and dirty, who came
  forward with an air of apology.</p>

  <p>"By heavens, it is Josiah Batter right enough!" Bastable whispered,
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>His heart was beating violently, and his forehead was wet. He reached out
  a shaking hand for a glass of water on the table in front of him, and drained
  it to the last drop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was some time before Dick was sufficiently composed to
  appreciate the full extent of his good fortune. There was no longer any doubt
  that the stones were genuine. It was not likely that an expert would make a
  mistake. Moreover, the stones belonged to him&mdash;had been openly and
  frankly given to him by Lady Amory. In the whole history of pure blind luck,
  Dick had never heard anything to equal this. Lady Amory's jewels had been
  cast into the quicksands by her sister in a fit of madness, and by a mere
  chance one of the genuine ornaments had been overlooked. By a still blessed
  chance, out of the mass of glittering rubbish the real jewel had passed into
  his possession.</p>

  <p>Dick's head swam as he thought of it. With this money he could face his
  creditors! He could not pay them all, but he would meet Herepath and Butler
  now, and get rid of their client.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if there is another piece of equally good stuff amongst that
  lot?" Dick ruminated as he drove along. "A bit of luck like this is often
  followed by another. Blest if I don't find out before I sleep to-night. It
  will be a jolly good thing for Bowen as well as myself."</p>

  <p>The verdict at Attenborough's only seemed to confirm the opinion of the
  expert in Bond-street. Dick was somewhat surprised to find that the
  representative who attended him had much information on the subject of Lady
  Amory and her gems.</p>

  <p>"It is our business to know these things," he said. "Oh, yes, we should be
  willing to allow you 8500 on this article. Would you prefer notes or
  gold?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take your cheque," Dick said. "I am in no immediate need of
  cash."</p>

  <p>He drove back to the office and posted the cheque to his banker. He had
  not felt so light-hearted for many a day. He was half inclined to stay in
  town and make a night of it with some of the old gang, but he resisted the
  temptation. That would mean cards and possibly something in the nature of a
  heavy gamble. Dick had lost most of his money in that way, and he had had a
  lesson lately. He put the impulse fairly aside, and wrote a letter to
  Herepath and Butler making an appointment for the following day. He felt he
  would be able to meet them on their own ground.</p>

  <p>It was getting late before he reached Shoremouth&mdash;too late for dinner
  at Oversands. He would go to the club and have a chat there instead. He
  strolled into the smoking-room, which was full of excited members discussing
  the dramatic events of the afternoon. A knot of loungers buzzed about
  him.</p>

  <p>"Why this sudden popularity?" Dick asked, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Just as if you didn't know," an acquaintance protested. "Did you hear
  anything of it before? Were you aware that he was not dead?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me an easy one!" Dick exclaimed. "Something has happened outside my
  knowledge. Who has turned up? I've been in London all day, and only just got
  back."</p>

  <p>"That accounts for it," the first speaker said. "I mean old Josiah Batter.
  The man we have regarded as dead for years, you know."</p>

  <p>"The hero who died for us at the post of duty fifteen years since? Well,
  go on."</p>

  <p>"He's turned up again. The police arrested him by the Red House soon after
  the murder was discovered. Evidently took him for one of the criminals. He
  was able to prove his innocence so far as that was concerned, but it seems
  that he was practically a witness of the deed. Gave the most dramatic
  evidence this afternoon. Hasn't been so much excitement in Shoremouth since
  the place was a smuggling village. I thought that perhaps you knew all about
  it."</p>

  <p>Dick listened with undisguised amazement. "All news to me," he said. "Like
  everybody else, I thought Batter was at the bottom of the quicksands years
  ago. He was lost when conveying a large sum of money in gold that we were
  sending secretly to the assistance of another bank. But if this means
  anything, it means that Batter stole the money and skipped with it. It was
  the more singular because he was not alone at the time. As a matter of fact,
  Jo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick paused, suddenly conscious that Ronald Bastable was one of his
  audience. Joseph Bastable had been with Batter at the time of the supposed
  fatal accident, and had come back with the news. Therefore it looked almost
  as if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Dick read all this in Ronald's moody eyes. He managed to get away from the
  knot of fellow-members presently and joined Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Ronald replied. "Those people don't understand the full
  significance of Batter's evidence. They only consider it as touching on the
  death of De Lava. They have forgotten about the facts surrounding the
  disappearance of Josiah Batter. Your people remember it because it has a
  bearing upon your fortunes. My father was with Batter. He came back and told
  Sir Horace about the disaster. Now, don't you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I decline to do so at present," Dick said, cheerfully. "Your father might
  have honestly believed that Batter had met with an accident. It was very dark
  at the time, and with Batter's knowledge of the stepping-stones he
  might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ronald listened miserably. This was very nice of Dick, but Ronald knew
  better. He knew that in some mysterious way his father's fortunes dated from
  the time when Batter and the gold had perished in the quicksands. He had
  looked at his father that afternoon when Batter came forward to give his
  evidence, and seen that in the older man's face which had poisoned the rest
  of the day for him.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, old chap," Dick said, hopefully. "It won't make any difference
  to Vera. I must go home. They'll be wondering what has become of me."</p>

  <p>The strange story had reached Oversands, of course. Vera, in the
  drawing-room, was trying to explain matters in whispers to Lady Amory. Sir
  Horace, who had taken a sudden turn for the better, had insisted on coming
  down after dinner. He lay on a couch in one of the big windows, and to all
  appearance was fast asleep. The room was large enough for conversation at one
  end without in the least disturbing anyone at the other.</p>

  <p>"My father does not know of this?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Vera said. "He was much better after lunch, and the doctor
  said he might come down for an hour this evening. It's risky, but better than
  fretting upstairs. He has gone to sleep, which is an excellent thing."</p>

  <p>"I suppose Batter has not turned up by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No. Did you ever hear of anything more extraordinary? I'm told that
  Shoremouth is talking about nothing else. What does it mean, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the inference is pretty plain," Dick said. "It was a put-up job
  between Batter and old Bastable. They divided the plunder, and probably
  Bastable got the best of the deal. Being the stronger and older man, he
  naturally would do so. Batter disappeared, and Bastable remained to make a
  fortune. He was a poor man in those days, and just about then his
  circumstances changed in the most curious way. The facts are forgotten by
  everybody but us, which is rather a good thing on the whole, because it makes
  it easier for Ronald."</p>

  <p>"Poor Ronald!" Vera said, softly. "Have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I left him at the club when I came here. He understands the full
  significance of it; in fact, he mentioned the matter to me. I made light of
  it, of course. I told him it would make no difference to you."</p>

  <p>The warm colour mantled Vera's cheeks. "That is true," she said, gently.
  "What does it matter, since there is disgrace on both sides? I am only sorry
  to see how little you feel it."</p>

  <p>The gentle reproof passed easily over Dick's head. "You will lecture me!"
  he said. "On the Stock Exchange we are down to-day and up to-morrow. This is
  one of my up days. My last speculation has turned out trumps, and I am in a
  position to meet every claim. The money is actually at my banker's, and I'm
  going back to work at once. But I'm not so casual as you imagine, my dear.
  I've had a pretty hard lesson, and I won't forget it. I have done with the
  old set, and will give you no anxiety in future."</p>

  <p>Vera expressed her pleasure at the declaration. She slipped away upstairs
  presently to see that all was ready in her father's bedroom. Sir Horace still
  slept on, and Lady Amory was deep in her game of Patience. Dick gently took
  the cards from her. She looked up with a smile.</p>

  <p>"So you are back again, Dick?" she said. "How happy you look!"</p>

  <p>Dick forgot the sleeping figure in the window. He spoke in a clear and
  eager voice.</p>

  <p>"That is because I have had some wonderful luck," he said. "I want you to
  try to understand. The ornament you gave me was not paste, but genuine. I
  took it to a big firm to-day and they advanced me some thousands of pounds
  upon it. I have got enough to tide me over until I can set my house in order.
  Another sum of equal amount would set me free. By accident, one of your gems
  was saved from the wreck. By accident, that very one found its way into my
  possession. Now, it's just possible there may be another. I want you to let
  me have one or two to take to London to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Lady Amory nodded brightly, though she shook her head. "I am glad," she
  said, "very glad for your sake, Dick. Of course, I will do everything I can
  to help you, but you will not hit upon good fortune like this again. There
  are one or two things I can get now, if you like."</p>

  <p>Dick acquiesced. It would be as well to have the jewels; it was more than
  possible that in the morning the poor lady would fail to grasp the state of
  affairs. If she would go at once, Dick would be much obliged. As the door
  closed behind her Sir Horace opened his eyes and struggled to his feet. His
  eyes were shining strangely, and he seemed to be suddenly possessed of a new
  vigour.</p>

  <p>"Well, Dick," he said, lustily. "So you are back again. Didn't you come
  and see me when I was ill? I have some hazy idea of telling you something.
  Upon my word, I forget what it was for the moment. Oh, something to do with
  an acceptance."</p>

  <p>He moved about the room restlessly, a curious suggestion of exultation in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm very tired," he went on. "I'll go to bed. Didn't I hear you say that
  you are going to London to-morrow? Well, I have to go to London too. We can
  travel up together, and I can tell you all about that little business.
  Good-night, my boy."</p>

  <p>He walked out of the drawing-room with a brisk air, humming a tune. He
  astonished the nurse by declining to avail himself of her services. Vera,
  venturing to remonstrate, was greeted with a smile and a jest.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right, my dear," the patient said. "Back to business to-morrow.
  I'm going to London with Dick. He will look after me, you know.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>The gay expression faded from his face and a look of eagerness filled his
  eyes. He carefully locked the door and took a key from his pocket. With this
  he opened a small dressing-case and removed a compact object wrapped in
  tissue-paper. He unfolded it with loving care.</p>

  <p>"Dare I venture?" he said. "Would it be safe? I wonder if it is possible
  that after all&mdash;but I am almost afraid to build up hopes on that."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Josiah had indeed provided a sensation for Shoremouth. The
  mere fact of his return from what looked like the grave, would have sufficed
  in ordinary circumstances, but the matter went deeper than that. There were
  people, of course, ready to play the sceptic. Batter had never been lost in
  the quicksands, they maintained, but these folk as a rule were the
  cantankerous gossips that flourish in every small town. There were legends
  that Batter had been seen in this or that part of the world, and it was
  whispered that Joseph Bastable could tell a story did he choose. For the most
  part, however, Shoremouth had accepted the tragedy as real.</p>

  <p>But here was Batter back again after all these years, shabby, shifty, and
  palpably worse for wear, standing by the table ready to give evidence. Many
  people in the hall remembered the old bank clerk, but apparently he was not
  anxious to recognise them. He shuffled to his place, white and shaky, and
  trembling with something like fear.</p>

  <p>"You have come to give evidence?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"The police brought me," Batter said. "I&mdash;I didn't come."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain, sir," Kite said. "One or two officers in
  the local force went as far as the Red House after I had reported what had
  taken place. They were acting under instructions from me. They found the
  witness prowling about, and took him in custody on suspicion. They were
  justified in doing this, as the witness showed a disposition to run away.
  When he was brought here he was recognised as an old inhabitant of the town.
  He has an interesting story to tell."</p>

  <p>"You used to live here once?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir," Batter said in his jarring voice. "I was in Amory's
  bank."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes for the first time and looked furtively around him. He
  started and shivered as he recognised Bastable. The glance of his old
  colleague seemed to fascinate him. He read something like murder in that
  concentrated look.</p>

  <p>"You were supposed to have been drowned?" the Coroner suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. That was the fact, sir. I met with an accident. My&mdash;my
  head was hurt, and I don't recollect what happened afterwards. When I found I
  had lost the money my nerves gave way, and I was afraid to come back."</p>

  <p>Bastable breathed more freely. This was better than he had expected. This
  ingenious story was plausible. In any case Batter would never have the
  audacity to come back and blackmail him! That the man was broken down and in
  dire need was apparent at a glance. He had crept back, as such people do, to
  the place where he had enjoyed at least comparative prosperity.</p>

  <p>"Well, we need not go into that," the Coroner suggested. "We are here to
  listen to what the witness has to tell us about the crime."</p>

  <p>"I came back to Shoremouth yesterday," Batter went on, huskily. "I walked
  from London. When I arrived I had no money. I came here to call on a friend
  who I thought might help me. It was after dark when I got to Shoremouth and
  went to the lodgings of my friend. To my disappointment he was away from
  home. There was nobody else I cared to appeal to, and I had to procure a
  night's lodging. Then I thought of the Red House. If the place was still
  unoccupied I could find accommodation there. No one recognised me as I passed
  through the town and along the shore to the sands. The door of the Red House
  was open and I went in. I was weary and worn out, and dropped off to sleep in
  the little sitting-room at the back of the dining-room. I don't know how long
  I slept, probably not more than an hour, when I was aroused by the sound of
  voices. I looked into the hall and saw two men. They were speaking in a
  language I did not understand, but from one or two odd words I should judge
  they were Italians."</p>

  <p>"Men of any particular class?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"They looked well-to-do and prosperous, sir," the witness explained. "I
  should say that they were men of business. Well-dressed, and all that kind of
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Not suspicious-looking characters?"</p>

  <p>"By no means, sir. They were smoking cigarettes and laughing together. I
  saw no signs of anything like temper. I could see they had a large basket
  with them, which they proceeded to carry into the dining-room. Presently I
  saw a brilliant light, and judged that they had brought a lamp with them. I
  smelt food, which I had been without all day, and I had half a mind to beg
  for some. Just then the two men left the house, and closed the door behind
  them."</p>

  <p>"You saw no more of them?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I did sir," the witness went on. "I expected they would come back
  or they would never have left that brilliant light behind them. I was very
  hungry, and the smell of food was tempting. I crept as far as the dining-room
  and looked in. There was a petrolite lamp on the table and a dainty supper
  set out. There were other things on the sideboard as well. I was looking to
  see what I could take without its being missed when the door opened and the
  two men returned. I had just time to hide behind the heavy curtain that hung
  over the window. A minute later and another man came in. He started back and
  would have gone again, but one of them quickly closed the door and locked it.
  Then he put the key in his pocket and burst out laughing."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that he laughed?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. He seemed to be highly amused at something. By moving the
  curtains a little I could see everything that was going on. Both the men I
  had discovered first appeared to be extremely pleased. The other man looked
  from one to the other and demanded something in an angry voice. I thought
  that he was frightened too. I was."</p>

  <p>At this naive confession the Coroner smiled. "What had you to be afraid
  of?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you see I was in an awkward position and very hungry. I hoped
  those men would not stay long, and that perhaps I might get a good supper
  with a little patience. All the time, too, I had a suspicion that something
  underhand was going on. I didn't like the way those two men laughed. There
  was something blood-curdling about it. Then the third man turned very white,
  and looked about him as if seeking for some avenue of escape. One of the
  others said something to him, and he spoke&mdash;in English."</p>

  <p>"'I don't understand your patois,' he said, sneering like. 'Try
  Italian.'</p>

  <p>"'English, if you please, then,' one of the others said. 'But we are not
  going to quarrel with you, my good Henri. The time for that kind of thing has
  long gone by. It is many months since we left the island in search of
  you.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, you have found me, what then?' the count asked.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any reason to ask the question? You are a traitor twice-fold,
  and must pay the penalty. You betrayed your own flesh and blood, and after
  that you betrayed us. Our quarrel with the Duke has been transferred to you.
  Now that Bentes is dead nothing matters. But you are to pay for your share,
  and that is why we are here to-night. Not that we are angry&mdash;not in the
  least. It is a pure matter of business with us. We know why you are here; we
  rejoice that you chose to come to this lonely spot and make it so easy for
  us. We run positively no risk whatever. There is not the remotest chance of
  anybody coming here either by day or night. Before you are discovered we
  shall be far away. To show that there is nothing vulgar in our quarrel, we
  invite you to sup with us. We conveyed these good things in our motor, now
  waiting outside. You will perceive, dear Henri, that everything is of the
  best. The wines have been chosen with loving care. Will you please sit down
  and make yourself at home?'</p>

  <p>"It was all very smoothly spoken, sir," Batter went on, "but it made my
  blood cold. I knew plainly that I was to witness a tragedy. The man addressed
  did not show any fear, except that his face was pallid and his eyes
  glistened. With an easy gesture he moved to the table and sat down. He ate a
  good supper and drank a little wine, and smoked a cigarette after talking to
  the others in a natural way. When they had finished all three stood up."</p>

  <p>"'Are you ready?' one of the men asked.</p>

  <p>"The count shrugged his shoulders. He tossed the end of his cigarette into
  the grate, and stood with his chest well forward. At a sign from the leader
  the second man advanced a step or two. I saw he had something glittering in
  his hand; he gave a sudden plunge with his arm, and the count staggered and
  fell backwards. A moment later he lay dead on the floor, with the dagger in
  his heart."</p>

  <p>A thrill ran through the listeners. The story was simply told, but it was
  none the less effective for that. There was a pause for a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"It was done as quickly as I have told it," Batter proceeded. "There was
  no struggle, no noise or confusion. The two men laid the count on the floor,
  and one of them did something with a box of matches. I could not see what it
  was, and I could not move for fear of being discovered. I knew that if I were
  discovered my life would have been forfeited. After that the murderers lit
  cigarettes and made preparations for departure. They left everything as it
  was, and for the first time I began to breathe freely. Despite the shock this
  had been to me I was dreadfully hungry. But I could not eat in the presence
  of a dead man. I began to remove some of the things into a back room, when I
  thought I heard a noise. I ran out into the night, and had barely hidden
  myself before some other people came along. I could not recognise them all.
  One I knew to be Inspector Kite, of Scotland Yard. After they had gone I went
  back, and had barely finished supper when the police arrived. By a bit of bad
  luck I fell into their hands, and&mdash;and that's about all I can tell
  you."</p>

  <p>The conclusion was tame, but the story lost nothing in the way of
  sensation. A murmur of voices rose in the hall, so that the Coroner had to
  call for silence.</p>

  <p>"You would recognise those men again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. I don't think it is likely that I shall ever forget their
  faces."</p>

  <p>"There ought to be no difficulty in tracing them," the Coroner remarked.
  "According to the evidence they came in a car. They must have purchased the
  materials for that remarkable supper-party not very far off."</p>

  <p>"They might have brought the goods from London," Kite remarked.</p>

  <p>"That is possible," the Coroner admitted. "But surely the car is something
  to go upon. It is impossible to hide traces of a car."</p>

  <p>Kite was of a different opinion, but this he kept to himself. He had
  stated from the first that this kind of crime was seldom if ever solved. It
  was true he had a full description of the outrage, but this was of little
  practical use. From his knowledge of the doings of secret societies he could
  have reconstructed the crime without any assistance from Batter. The deadlock
  still existed.</p>

  <p>"Have you any more witnesses to call?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present, sir," Kite explained. "Neither can I see any prospect of
  doing so at present. I ask for an adjournment for a month."</p>

  <p>The Coroner glanced at his watch and rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "The inquiry stands adjourned till this day month,
  at the same hour."</p>

  <p>The excited spectators flocked out of the court to discuss the doings of
  the day in the open air. As Batter turned a heavy hand fell on his shoulder.
  He looked up and saw the hard red face of Bastable glaring into his.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"I should like a few words with you," Bastable said,
  harshly. "Come to the side door of my office after five o'clock and walk in.
  I shall be alone, and ready to hear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>Bastable held that money could do everything. That was part of his creed,
  an axiom that had never failed him as yet. Doubtless, Sir Horace was like the
  rest when it came to his pocket.</p>

  <p>He was still debating the matter when Batter shuffled into the office. He
  turned upon the broken man with savage brutality.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he said. "What does this mean? Why did you come back, you
  white-livered cur? You used to be a man once!"</p>

  <p>Something of the old manhood stirred in Batter now. He looked round the
  luxuriantly-appointed office, and noted the evidences of wealth and
  prosperity about him.</p>

  <p>"I was a man until I came under your influence," he said. "Now I am a
  wreck and you are rich and respected, all owing to me. You picked me out as
  your tool; you recognised my weaknesses and played on them. You induced me to
  plunder Sir Horace, so that I should be in your power. Of course, you paid
  for the work. But you gave me money on terms, and when the time came for you
  to get your bond I paid it with my good name and reputation. I had 500 and
  you had the balance of the money which was supposed to be hidden with my body
  in the quicksands. What a fool I was! I almost laugh when I think of it."</p>

  <p>"You'll laugh on the other side of your face presently," Bastable
  growled.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. There is nothing for me to be afraid of now. And
  besides, Sir Horace Amory might be glad to know that he has a fair prospect
  of getting the 13,500 back. I mean to tell Sir Horace the truth."</p>

  <p>Bastable's manner changed. The cold fear was gripping his heart. "Better
  think it over first," he said. "You can do nothing for a day or two. Sir
  Horace is ill&mdash;has had a seizure, and sees nobody. Give the matter a
  day's consideration, and come and see me at my house to-morrow night after
  dinner. Why should you try to injure me after all these years?"</p>

  <p>Batter laughed ironically. There was a sardonic humour in the question.
  "I'll come and see you to-morrow night," he said. "But I make no promise.
  It's a lucky thing for you that Sir Horace is ill just now."</p>

  <p>Batter passed out of the office, leaving Bastable to his meditations.
  Scheme as he would, he could see no way out. All that evening and all next
  day he pondered this and that solution. Black care was with him after dinner;
  it poisoned his cigar. He must do something with Batter this evening, if it
  cost him ten thousand pounds. But Batter did not call; instead, came a note
  on shabby paper to the effect that Sir Horace had asked him to Oversands
  between nine and ten that night on important business.</p>

  <p>Bastable tore up the note and dropped the pieces in the fire. It was news
  to him&mdash;most unpleasant and dangerous news&mdash;that Sir Horace was so
  much better. This message upset all his carefully-laid plans. He must see
  Batter at once, and try what a heavy bribe would do. If Batter stuck to the
  tale sketched out for him, then no harm would come to the man who had wrecked
  the fond fool's life. But if he told the truth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Bastable rose from his chair and put on his hat. Before he slept that
  night he must learn the worst. He would see Sir Horace. He glanced at the
  clock. There would be plenty of time to get this interview over before Batter
  put in an appearance. It was very humiliating, no doubt, but in the
  circumstances there was nothing else to be done.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace had dined and was in the library, so the footman informed
  Bastable. Yes, Sir Horace was decidedly better; in fact, his recovery had
  been astonishing. He had actually been in London all day on business. If
  Bastable would wait a moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No hurry," Bastable said. "But please make Sir Horace understand that I
  must see him. It is most important business, my good fellow."</p>

  <p>The footman came back with the intimation that Sir Horace would see his
  visitor at once. Bastable's lips curled as he crossed the hall. There was no
  sign of poverty or trouble; all looked as if it worked on oiled wheels. The
  pictures, the armour, the gleaming palms bespoke wealth and that suggestion
  of serenity so marked in houses of that class. It was very different from the
  house in High-street where Bastable lived. Yet he told himself that he could
  buy up all this and more without feeling the loss. He meant to try sooner or
  later, and make Ronald a handsome present on his wedding-day. It was only a
  matter of time.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace rose courteously as his visitor entered. He bore no trace of
  his illness; indeed, Bastable could never remember his looking so well. He
  had lost every sign of uneasiness, and his manner was bland and
  dignified.</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated, Mr. Bastable," he said, quietly, but with that faint
  touch of patronage that always sent the blood to Bastable's face. "This is
  rather unusual, though I am glad to see you; in fact, you saved me writing a
  letter."</p>

  <p>Bastable was taken aback. He was trying to feel at his ease in that
  luxurious room, but there was a cold sensation at his heart.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have come to see me on the same business," Sir Horace
  proceeded. "I am alluding to the dramatic appearance of my old clerk
  Batter."</p>

  <p>"I was as surprised as yourself," Bastable said.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, no doubt. Shall we say disagreeably surprised?"</p>

  <p>Bastable misunderstood the pointedness of the question. "That's not a
  pretty way of putting it," he said.</p>

  <p>Sir Horace smiled blandly. He appeared to be master of the situation.</p>

  <p>"It is no time for picking one's words," he said. "I have not seen Batter
  yet, because I have been in London all day, but he has written to say he will
  be here this evening. You have seen him?"</p>

  <p>Bastable would have given much to be able to deny the suggestion. He would
  have lied about it could he have done so safely.</p>

  <p>"Only for a moment," he said. "In the street; he asked me for money. I
  have not seen him since. There is something very wrong here, Sir Horace."</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it," Sir Horace said, significantly. "On the face of it,
  I should say that I have been deliberately robbed of 14,000. I think that
  was the sum that was entrusted to Batter and yourself fourteen years ago to
  carry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Bastable said, eagerly. "I admit my responsibility. So long
  as I believed Batter to be at the bottom of the quicksands with the money I
  felt no blame attached to me. It was an accident that might have happened to
  anybody. But since Batter has turned up again, I cannot disguise from myself
  that I am liable. It is no use to prosecute Batter&mdash;it would only be
  throwing good money away. I suggest that you refuse to see him and refer him
  to me. I can deal with that type of man much better than you can, Sir Horace.
  I ask you as a favour to leave it in my hands. As to the lost money, I shall
  be happy to refund it. I have my cheque-book in my pocket, and I will draw a
  draft in your favour now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">BASTABLE smiled more or less amiably. It was a great card to
  play, a terrible wrench to part with all this money, but some sacrifice had
  to be made. Sir Horace would take it, of course; at the present moment the
  money would be a blessing to him.</p>

  <p>"That is very magnanimous of you Mr. Bastable," he said. "But I do not see
  my way to accept your offer. It is no question of money just now; I mean
  that, as matters stand, if I took your cheque my subsequent actions might be
  open to grave criticisms. I refer to my acceptance in favour of Mr.
  Kennedy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The bill I found amongst Mr. Kennedy's papers?" Bastable asked.</p>

  <p>"The same. As regards that matter, I am consulting my solicitors. They may
  find it necessary to dispute, but I will say no more on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dispute what?" Bastable demanded. "If Kennedy were here
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A startled-looking footman came into the library with a card on a tray. He
  held it out to his master in a dazed way. Sir Horace gave some muttered
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"This is a time of dramatic surprises," he said. "We shall have an
  opportunity of knowing what Mr. Kennedy would say if he were here now. This
  is Mr. John Kennedy's card. He is waiting for me in the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>Bastable laughed harshly. At first it occurred to him that a cunning plot
  had been laid for him. It was the kind of thing he would have applauded had
  it been engineered at the expense of anybody else.</p>

  <p>He was fond of that sort of vulgar trick. More than once he had found it
  effective, though not with a man of his astuteness. Really, Sir Horace had
  gone too far.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty," he said. "Excellent idea. But you are trying it on with the
  wrong man."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace looked up from the card he was examining with polite
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "I'm afraid that I fail to catch your
  meaning."</p>

  <p>"Not you," Bastable replied. "As if I wasn't up to this kind of thing! But
  when you go so far as to pretend that old Kennedy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bastable laughed again. A smile of comprehension dawned upon Amory's
  face.</p>

  <p>"I begin to follow you," he said. "You think this is some silly scheme of
  mine to frighten you. I have heard of these&mdash;dodges in modern business.
  They are particularly favoured by the city shark of the 'financial agent'
  order. Upon my word, Mr. Bastable, I am greatly obliged to you! Would you
  like to see Mr. Kennedy?"</p>

  <p>Bastable made some half-inarticulate reply. He was not sure. He was
  gradually coming to see that this was no stratagem on Amory's part. Very
  slowly it was dawning upon him that Kennedy was alive. How long had Amory
  known it? He would have given a fortune for the information. Perhaps he had
  been aware of the fact from the first. He might have had exclusive
  information. If so the man whom he despised was treating him as if he had
  been a child.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he muttered, "if you and Mr. Kennedy between
  you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will ask you not to take that tone," Amory interrupted. "I cannot
  permit of it for a moment. There are certain things that you cannot
  understand; it would be hopeless to try&mdash;to teach you. With all his
  peculiarities, Mr. Kennedy is a gentleman. I hope I am another. Methods that
  you recognise as legitimate we would not stoop to. At this moment I know
  nothing except that Mr. Kennedy is alive. I thought him dead, as everybody
  else did. He has come back at a most awkward moment&mdash;for you."</p>

  <p>The menace of the words were clear&mdash;none the less clear because they
  were quite courteous. There was a hard ring in Amory's speech that frightened
  Bastable. This was the man whom he had regarded as a pompous good-natured
  fool!</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I must leave you to place your own interpretation upon it," Sir Horace
  said. "It is not for me to teach you how to conduct your business."</p>

  <p>"You think that acceptance was a forgery?"</p>

  <p>Amory smiled slightly. It amused him to note how this clever man was
  blundering. He was floundering headlong into the trap.</p>

  <p>"What acceptance are you alluding to?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As if you didn't know," Bastable said, doggedly. "Come, speak out."</p>

  <p>"Really, there is nothing to say. I owe Mr. Kennedy a large sum of money.
  It is not convenient to pay him, and I look forward to a renewal of my paper.
  Mr. Kennedy disappears in circumstances that point to his death, and, to all
  practical purposes, you become my creditor. I do not desire to owe money to
  you, and I take up the bill! The bill exists; I pay it without any protest. I
  don't ask if it is the original bill. Presumably, I am dealing with an honest
  man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bastable started. His face took on a deeper shade of red.</p>

  <p>"And therefore I raise no question. If there are any questions to be
  asked, I should much prefer to ask them through my solicitors."</p>

  <p>Bastable said nothing. He wanted time to think; he wanted to be alone to
  ponder this new development. That was his usual method. Slowly and patiently
  he fabricated a scheme. He regarded it from every standpoint; looked
  mercilessly for all its weak points. What would his adversary do in this or
  that case? And how could he counter if this or that happened? Then he would
  score his points quickly; thus he had come to be regarded as a man of
  intellect. Naturally, he was dull and stupid; but his wits were gathered
  now.</p>

  <p>He was fighting with his back to the wall, and he knew it. Obviously, the
  less he said the better.</p>

  <p>"You made a suggestion, just now," Sir Horace went on. "You offered to
  refund the money lost so many years ago by your&mdash;carelessness. In
  certain circumstances, I should have accepted your offer. I may accept it
  yet; it all depends upon what happens when I see Batter presently. It is not
  the question of the money. As a matter of fact, I am in no need of money. I
  never shall be again."</p>

  <p>For the life of him Bastable could not repress a sneer.</p>

  <p>"A course of judicious speculation has justified itself. I was afraid at
  one time and my engagements kept me close. But that is all over. I am
  thinking of disposing of my bank; I wonder if your people would buy."</p>

  <p>Bastable didn't know. He wished he could feel that this man was lying to
  him&mdash;that this was the sort of cheap stuff he had to listen to every day
  of his life. He rose from his chair and reached for his hat. Obviously
  nothing was to be gained by staying. There was yet another way open to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I stand by my offer," he said, bluffly. "I see now that I was to
  blame, and I am ready to accept the consequences. Good-night, Sir
  Horace."</p>

  <p>Amory bade his visitor good-night amiably. He had every reason to feel
  satisfied with the interview. He saw Bastable to the front door and remarked
  genially on the state of the weather. Then he went off to the drawing-room to
  meet Kennedy. It was marvellous how things were going his way.</p>

  <p>But Kennedy was no longer there. He had not been able to stay, so Dick
  informed his father. Many things had required his immediate attention. He
  would come up again to-morrow; in fact, he had invited himself to dinner on
  the next evening. He had arrived in Shoremouth that afternoon late and gone
  to his office. There was one little matter that he did not understand on
  looking through his accounts.</p>

  <p>"I thought that Bastable had taken possession of everything," Sir Horace
  said.</p>

  <p>"Kennedy had two sets of keys," Dick explained. "Anyway, it doesn't
  signify. There hasn't been time yet for Bastable to interfere with the
  routine of the old man's business. There was one thing he could not
  understand at all. He says you can explain it. It is possible he may call and
  see you at the bank to-morrow. I don't want to interfere with your affairs,
  dad, but has it anything to do with that acceptance?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, everything," Sir Horace replied. "I owed Kennedy the
  money all right, and it was most inconvenient to pay. But directly I found
  that I was in the power of Bastable I resolved to liquidate the debt at all
  hazards. It was impossible to remain in the grip of a man like that. You know
  what he meant to do with me; in fact, his own son was so good as to warn me
  of my danger. I paid the bill."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the money?" Dick asked, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I found it. I had to make a great sacrifice, but I found it. When
  the bill came back to me I saw it was a forgery."</p>

  <p>"Yet you paid it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Sir Horace said, slowly. "I paid it. The bill was supposed to be
  deposited with Mr. Kennedy's bankers, in other words with Bastable. I took
  the wind out of his sails by calling him in and telling him all I knew. At
  first he professed he had never seen the bill. When I nailed that lie to the
  counter he said that it was amongst Kennedy's papers. He went over to the
  bank to fetch it, and sent a message that it was with the agents in London.
  Then I knew that he hadn't got the bill, and if he produced anything in the
  shape of an acceptance it would be a forgery. He thought it would be safe, as
  Kennedy was out of the way. I should take it for granted that the thing was
  mine and pay. In the ordinary course of things I should have done so. I
  should have destroyed the paper and thought no more about it. But that man
  was trying to ruin me. I felt sure he would be unscrupulous in his methods.
  When the bill came to be presented for payment, sure enough I was right."</p>

  <p>"Of course you were," Dick cried. "The fool who forged it never looked at
  the date stamp. Now let me tell you what happened when you were ill.... What
  do you think of that? I frightened Bastable out of his wits. By jove! I
  recollect now. When I mentioned to him the matter of the date stamp, he was
  furious. He mentioned a name that did not convey much to me at the time, but
  it's clear now. It's quite plain that the forger of the bill was poor old
  John Turk. In his rage Bastable blurted out Turk's name. Oh, we've got him
  right enough. What is the next move?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends upon circumstances," Sir Horace said. "I am in a
  position to prove that Bastable has obtained from me 20,000 by false
  pretences. I don't care for this kind of dirty work; but I have to protect
  myself. It is certain that Bastable robbed me of a further 14,000 in
  collusion with Batter. This money must be paid back, and fortunately Bastable
  is in a position to refund it. That man's hatred of me and his insane desire
  to humiliate me have driven him to this. He thought that Fate had placed all
  the weapons in his hands. On the face of it, really he had every
  encouragement. He never realised I could pay. He did not know that I was a
  wealthy man."</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall see some fun presently," he said. "I don't think I'll stop
  now and watch the meeting between Batter and you. I have to see Ronald
  Bastable at the club. Funny thing that he should be the son of his father,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman," Sir Horace murmured. "But, of course, he is an Amory."</p>

  <p>Dick went on his way chuckling. Sir Horace had provided him with an
  argument for future use. He found Ronald in the club moodily reading the
  evening paper.</p>

  <p>"Come into the window, where we can be quiet," he said. "I've something to
  say to you about Bowen. Well, I've found the money to put matters right. It
  doesn't signify how I got it, but I got it honestly, and there is an end of
  the worry. What I need now is Bowen. I hope he'll return with some story of
  having been drugged and kept in a state of insensibility by a lot of rascals
  concerned in some Stock Exchange swindle. Do you see what I mean? Bowen must
  be got at."</p>

  <p>"If you know where he is, why not?" Ronald asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know where he is," Dick smiled. "In fact, I have seen him. But he
  is not in a position to do as he pleases; in fact, he is in prison on a
  serious charge. I laugh when I think of it."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled in turn. "I had an idea that such was the case," he said.
  "Then I am to understand that Sexton, now in the police cell, is none
  other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Dick said, coolly. "Sexton is Bowen in disguise, and he is
  detained on a charge of being concerned in kidnapping&mdash;himself!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

  <p class="first">Joseph Bastable was not happy. In his more expansive moments
  he was wont to regard himself as a model to be imitated and envied, but
  lately he had abandoned that attitude. He was frightened. He still strode
  down High-street with his hat on the back of his head, and the usual
  truculent nod for his acquaintances, but his heart was full of fear. The man
  was a bully to the backbone, and it looked as if his time had come.</p>

  <p>He could get no information from any trustworthy quarter. He might have
  extracted it out of the drunken, broken-down Turk, had not Turk departed. He
  had left Shoremouth altogether for some place in the north, where he would be
  properly attended to, and Bastable could not get his address. He might,
  perhaps, have vented some of his spite on Batter, but Batter, too, the town
  knew no more. He was supposed to have emigrated to America.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, Sir Horace and Kennedy had deemed it judicious to get
  these two men out of the way. Looking at things from his own standpoint,
  therefore, Bastable concluded that there was a conspiracy against him. Sir
  Horace meant to prosecute him, and was getting up his case. This was how
  Bastable would have acted had the position been reversed. At any moment, he
  imagined, he might be arrested. At the sight of a policeman the moisture
  oozed on his forehead, and he forgot to return the officer's salute.</p>

  <p>What were these fellows doing? Why didn't they make a move in the matter?
  For some days they had been in London. Bastable could stand it no longer. He
  would see Kennedy and propose terms. But it was more than a week ere this was
  possible. Then it was Mr. Kennedy who sent for Bastable. The message was curt
  and to the point. Bastable was to call, directly after luncheon.</p>

  <p>As he swaggered down the street people greeted him respectfully. He was
  the man in the place to be envied above all others. How could they know that
  his legs were trembling under him, that there was a dryness at the back of
  his throat! Joseph Bastable would have sacrificed every penny of his beloved
  money to be at Oversands again, humbly listening to Sir Horace's orders.</p>

  <p>Kennedy kept him waiting so long that his nerves began to give way. He sat
  a trembling mass of fear. He could hardly speak when Mr. Kennedy entered. The
  latter did not shake hands as usual.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me, sir?" Bastable said.</p>

  <p>"I did," Kennedy replied. "I had to. But you need not grovel. How long is
  it since you spoke to anybody in that respectful way?"</p>

  <p>Bastable ventured on a faint smile. "I am always at your service," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," Kennedy said, drily. "No doubt, Joseph. I am glad to see you
  are not unduly puffed up by success. True greatness is always humble,
  Joseph."</p>

  <p>"I have worked very hard for my money, Mr. Kennedy," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have," Kennedy smiled. "I admit that freely. But you have made
  much more by scheming than by hard work, Joseph. Honestly, what are you
  worth?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Bastable repeated the figures with some pride. Kennedy
  appeared to be taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Really!" he exclaimed. "So much as that! Why, you have more money than I.
  Now, tell me candidly, what possessed you to be so foolish in the matter of
  Sir Horace Amory?"</p>

  <p>Eager as Bastable was to speak, at first the words refused to come, but
  when he was started it was not so difficult.</p>

  <p>"I hated him," he said. "He always looked down on me, and when a man looks
  down upon me I curse him and plot revenge. He tried to stop my marriage, to
  deprive me of the best wife man ever had. I swore I would ruin him. More than
  once I had him in my grasp, but he managed to elude me. Then came a real
  chance."</p>

  <p>Kennedy lay back in his chair, watching his visitor with acute interest.
  He might have been a scientist studying a new specimen.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he said, "a gift from the gods. You expected to crush your
  enemy without risk or expense to yourself. You are alluding to that
  promissory note of mine?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Bastable went on. "I thought you were dead. I knew that
  when you were dead I should be your executor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have no sense of humour, Joseph. But you will have to pay, my friend.
  You will have to pay Sir Horace the 14,000 you robbed him of fourteen years
  ago, at compound interest, which makes the sum over 30,000. You will have to
  refund the 20,000 obtained by means of the forged bill. Please don't argue,
  because you are not entitled to do so. These are our terms, Joseph."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Dick and Ronald spent an anxious hour or so next day in the
  police-court.</p>

  <p>It would, perhaps, have been better had Bowen been legally represented,
  but in view of the fact of what was going to take place later the policy
  amply justified itself. Besides the evidence of the letter and the telegram
  from Sexton found in De Lava's possession the police had no further testimony
  to offer.</p>

  <p>"In that event I apply for bail," Bowen said, eagerly. "I have been
  detained on the flimsiest evidence for some days, your worships."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is so," the chairman said. "Case adjourned for a fortnight.
  The prisoner is released on his own recognisances in the sum of 100. Next,
  please, Mr. Chief. We shall be here all day at this rate."</p>

  <p>It was a piece of blind luck, of course&mdash;the story of an officious
  policeman and a pompous magistrate.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to convey a certain sum of money to Bowen, who an
  hour later was on his way to London. When at length he reached the
  metropolis, Sexton no longer existed&mdash;Bowen was restored to his office.
  With grim amusement Dick read the story of Bowen's abduction in the daily
  press next day. On the whole it was not a bad story, and sufficed to satisfy
  the public.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Dick had letters to write, and Ronald found himself with Vera.</p>

  <p>"The whole afternoon to ourselves," Ronald said. "What shall we do?"</p>

  <p>"A long walk," Vera suggested. "One of the walks we used to take years and
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Ronald smiled. "Let us cross the park and go as far as the
  Red House. I am anxious to see the bridge my father is building. They have
  made wonderful progress in the last ten days. The huge baulks of timber are
  all in place. Now that the big piles are in, they tell me the river has
  changed its course. What amazing things they do nowadays, with engineering
  machinery! The sands are ever so much firmer, and lower down, near the Red
  House, they have almost vanished. What will the place be without the
  quicksands?"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>His eye roamed over what had once been a wide expanse of shifting,
  quivering, grey sands. But how changed the scene! The boiling mass had gone,
  leaving a deep track of hard silt behind. The stepping-stones stood out in
  great masses of granite, like a row of grim sentinels. The bed was firm to
  the tread. Ronald scraped some of the yellow stuff aside with his foot.</p>

  <p>"Fancy a few piles higher up the river doing this," he said. "Well, it is
  certainly less repulsive. In a year or so when the golf links are
  open&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused and looked down. Some glittering thing was sticking out of the
  sand at the base of one of the stepping-stones. Ronald stooped and wrenched
  it from its place.</p>

  <p>"What treasure is this?" he asked. "What smuggler in the old
  days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sudden cry of illumination came from Vera. "I know what it is," she
  said. "It is my aunt's jewel-case!"</p>

  <p>Ronald turned the contents of the box out on to the grass. What at one
  time had been fine leather cases lined with velvet were now rotten masses of
  pulp. Embedded in the centre of each case was an ornament. They looked dull
  and lustreless, and not in the least suggestive of the fortune they were
  worth.</p>

  <p>"They seem like theatrical stuff," Ronald said. "Do you think it possible
  that the years of exposure to the sea water has done them harm? I never heard
  that such could be the case. The diamonds seem to be dull and worn at the
  edges. Surely, the sand could not do that. Well, I am no expert, so we will
  take these, treasures to Oversands."</p>

  <p>Sir Horace pondered the matter deeply. He was asking himself a few
  questions. The lost gems had been recovered in their casket, but they looked
  like rubbish. On the other hand two of Lady Amory's ornaments which she
  regarded as paste had turned out to be of priceless value; they had saved the
  fortunes of the family. Suppose, suppose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It came to me like a flash," he said, "Lady Amory's sister made a
  mistake. She removed the paste from the proper box and replaced it with the
  genuine gems. Then she took the real gem-case and threw it into the
  quicksands, and all these years nobody has taken the trouble to verify the
  story. This could have been done by critical examination of the stones. Of
  course, the imitations were excellent, and it was only after they had been in
  the salt water for many years that the difference grew very manifest, even to
  the untutored eye."</p>

  <p>They broke into groups presently, Ronald and Vera strolling into the
  garden.</p>

  <p>"I am glad your people are coming here this evening, Ronald," Vera said.
  "I am going to be very fond of your mother. Your father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There will never be any trouble between us, sweetheart," he whispered.
  "What a wonderful romance it has been, to be sure. And in so short a time,
  too! It is only a few weeks since I first called here and saw the little girl
  who was my old love in the days gone by. Then I knew&mdash;well, you will
  understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
