house lay a corpse that had come up from the grave itself. While
Emma Wayne watched helpless from the dirt-smeared windows of that
darkened, tragic dwelling, fleshless grey Things crept relentlessly
upon the man she loved, waylaid by horror on the night-shrouded

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; WHEN LOVE WENT MAD!</h2>

<p class="first">EMMA WAYNE'S small hand shook a little as she
fumbled her key into the grey door of the ancient Sprool house, and
she was shivering inside her thin suit-coat. But it was not only
the sharp chill of dusk that had set her quivering. The old dread
lay like a leaden lump in her breast, the dread that, as far back
as memory went, inevitably had come when the sun's last red rim
vanished behind the jagged ridge of Big Tom and night began to fill
the valley's bowl.</p>

<p>As in the old days, the circumscribing mountains were tightening
the ominous loom of their ring with the withdrawing light, were
becoming formless, vast bulks of blue-grey menace; and, beneath the
haze blurring their slopes, crawling, eerie things of the night
stirred to unholy being&mdash;or so whispered the legends of the
countryside. To Emma the very hills were endowed with uncanny,
motionless life as they thrust gigantic shoulders against the
darkling sky like quiescent monsters waiting in silent, age-long
patience; waiting till at last their appointed time should come to
crush, with one temptuous gesture, the puny human lives scuttering
in the valley.</p>

<p>The girl's mouth twisted bitterly. Here she was just as Kurt
Tradin had predicted two years ago, returned to the mountains and
their gloomy forebodings... The borrowed horse she had tied to the
gate down there whinnied, the sound edged with shrill fear.
Startled, Emma whirled to it, peered fearfully into the gathering
shadows. What on earth was the animal afraid of? Why had it cried
out as if it sensed some threat in the unkempt, overgrown garden?
Why was Emma herself afraid, not knowing of what? Perhaps because
the place was so uncared-for, so desolate. Gram shouldn't
have&mdash;</p>

<p>But of course, grandmother was dead. That was why Emma had come
back, why Milton, the husband she had found in the city that had
been otherwise so cruel, was joining her here. The little old lady
whose bleared and rheumy eyes had pleaded with her not to go, was
dead&mdash;and buried. Kurt's letter had brought the tidings when
it finally had reached her, its painfully addressed envelope
scrawled with the postman's notations that explained its week's
lateness. Gram was in the little cemetery above, where the village
was hidden by Big Tom's jutting spur, and the old house was
empty...</p>

<p><i>Something slithered along the door,</i> thumped softly.
Emma's breath caught in her throat. Tensely, she listened to the
thud of her own blood in her ears and&mdash;silence. Silence that
lay on the hills like a grey shroud, that was a living, tangible
thing within the house. Silence that in itself was fear.</p>

<p>The girl bit her lip. "It's nothing," she assured herself.
"Nothing at all." She did not realize that she was speaking aloud.
"Just&mdash;just my imagination." And indeed there was now no
sound, inside or out, save for the <i>pud, pud</i> of the restive
horse still straining to break free the rein that held him. "I'm a
fool to be scared." But why did the brute whinny again, then snort
at something <i>she</i> could not see?</p>

<p>This was silly, unutterably silly! Milton would laugh at her
when he got here and she told him how afraid she had been to enter
the house where she was born. The lock grated protestingly, clicked
over. Lucky she had kept that key all these months.</p>

<p>The door opened under the push of her icy hand. Except for a
filming of dust the hall was just as she remembered it with its
antlered hat rack and the slender, graceful curve of the banisters
where the stairs lifted to obscurity above. Light still filtered in
dimly through the arched opening from the parlor, spreading ebony
shadows on worn Brussels carpeting. Queer shadows! That one for
instance, long and angular as if it were thrown by a horizontal box
resting on trestles...</p>

<p>Grisly fingers squeezed Emma's heart. Three years ago just such
a shadow lay here, and in the parlor Granddad Sprool had been stiff
in the coffin by which it was cast. <i>This was the shadow of a
coffin</i>&mdash;and the sickeningly sweet odor of funeral flowers
was heavy in her nostrils!</p>

<p>No! Gram was buried, <i>buried!</i> They wouldn't have kept her
here, untended, for the two weeks since she had died! It was just a
trick of light and her own taut nerves?</p>

<p>That dark silhouette tapered slightly, just as Granddad's casket
had, but it was smaller. Gram had always been shorter than Granddad
and the years had shrunk her. Emma licked dry lips, and knew that
she must get to the parlor door, that she must look to see what
made that shadow. But her legs wouldn't move...</p>

<p>She got them going at last... It was as if the dusty air had
suddenly grown thick, viscous, so that she had to push through it
with all her strength. She reached the threshold at last, held onto
the lintel and pulled herself into the musty parlor. The windows
were grey rectangles in the faded wall; under her feet the floor
seemed to heave, like the swelling sea. Emma whimpered, far back in
her throat. The coffin <i>was</i> there&mdash;an ominous bulk in
the gloom...</p>

<p>ONCE started toward it she could not stop. She was close to the
thing. She was looking down into it, where the half-lid had been
removed&mdash;looking down at Gram's closed eyes and the almost
transparent hands crossed on a bosom of black silk that was
terribly still. The old woman's skin was drawn tight over her
fleshless bones, so tight that a skull seemed to answer Emma's
gaze... They had edged the corpse-dress with a white neck-ruching.
And that brown streak across its starched stiffness was the trail
of a slimy, crawling thing...</p>

<p>The girl swayed, grabbed at the casket-edge to keep herself from
falling. Something gritty crumbled under her hand&mdash;earth! Mud
had caked the sides and top of the black box, had dried there. And
here were the gouged places where the ropes had rubbed that had let
the coffin down into a grave where it had not stayed...</p>

<p>A scream sliced through the walls of the house! Another, compact
with ineffable terror. Outside, wood splintered, crashed. Across a
window's oblong reared the head and shoulders of Emma's horse. A
gate-picket dangled from its bridle and banged crazily against
flailing forelegs. The brute screamed once more, plunged down and
out of view. Galloping hoofs pounded away.</p>

<p>Not knowing she had moved, the girl was across the room, was
staring out. A dust cloud thundered down the road, stopped
suddenly. The horse reared out of it, whirled in a strange dervish
dance. In the eerie half-light a grey, shapeless something clung to
the beast's belly, reached grey tendrils for its foam-flecked,
out-straining throat. Then the frantic animal was gone around a
bend. Only the diminuendo of its <i>pudding</i> hoofs and the
shrill panic of its almost human screams were left, coming back to
Emma through quivering, affrighted dusk...</p>

<p>Moments later, as night welled up the towering slopes, the girl
still stood motionless, flattened against the window as that last
awful glimpse had left her. She was poignantly conscious of the
preternaturally disinterred corpse behind her, but nightmare
paralysis held her rigid and her larynx was sore, rasped by
unuttered screams. The faceless Things of the hills had come down
into the valley at last, into the precincts of her ancestral home.
The drear dread of the mountains was a living, tangible presence in
this house where she and the man she loved had hoped to find refuge
from a world that had denied them. It was here, <i>here</i> in this
room. She felt its chill fingers stroking her spine, its icy breath
on her neck. <i>Something</i> was here, something that had brought
Gram back from the grave, something that itself had come from that
mountainside burial ground!</p>

<p>The vague clatter of hoof-beats impinged on her consciousness.
Emma lifted burning eyes to Big Tom's rocky summit across the
valley, to the pale ribbon glimmering along his darkening flank.
That was the new highway, she remembered, the recently opened
macadam trail Milt had pointed out on the map as the way he would
come when he had finished the business that delayed him. And on it,
miles away, the failing light picked out a tiny moving
horse&mdash;her horse. Somehow, even across the space between, the
girl sensed the incarnate terror flogging that anguished beast,
flogging him to insane flight from the horror that clung beneath
his belly and fled with him.</p>

<p>The distance-dwarfed steed staggered, fell. A final shrill neigh
split the awed hush of the mountain-encompassed hollow. Horrible
movement animated the prostrate beast; greyness flowed over it,
merged it with the grey road. The pallid mound heaved, sickeningly,
for long moments. Then the ash-tinted destroyer ebbed slowly from
its victim, slithered into bordering trees. A tawny shape was very
still as the up-surge of night's sightlessness engulfed it, and the
highway, and the trees into which horror had seethed.</p>

<p>It was as if Satan had set a vaulted black lid over the valley
to hide it from God's sight. There was no light in the sky, utterly
no light in the broad sweep of the dale. No sound except a faint
rustle of wind in the forest cloaking the mountain-sides.</p>

<p>Or <i>was</i> it the wind in the leaves? Grisly fingers plucked
Emma's quivering nerves to new apprehension. Was it not rather the
slithering advance of the wan hosts that so long had danced as
pale, mist-like wraiths on the twilight slopes, unleashed at last
to their long-deferred invasion of the lowlands? Loosed by Gram's
passing, perhaps; by the death of the pioneer's spouse who first
had intruded into this valley and driven them back into the
hills... Was that why Faith Sprool had been brought back here from
the sanctuary of consecrated ground, that in death they might wreak
on her a weird vengeance for the thralldom to which her life had
condemned them?...</p>

<p>Oh God! Oh good God! Emma's fingers twisted, interlacing, and
her slender frame was a shell brimful with terror. The advancing
sound was no longer a dim, just hearable rustle. It was a thrum
pulsing toward her, a swift-coming burr momentarily louder. They
were coming fast now. Faster. <i>They were coming for her!</i></p>

<p>Of course for her! She was a Sprool, the last of the Sprools,
and she did not know the secret Granddad and Gram had had that held
Them back. She had always suspected there was a secret Granddad
knew, the haughty patrician in whose leathery visage steely eyes
brooded and who held himself and his family so high above the
valley-folk. But she had never dreamed that this was it. Why hadn't
they told her how to drive back the eerie company sweeping down on
her?</p>

<p>A green light-beam scythed the darkness out there, struck the
road into livid relief. Vague forms seemed to dart for concealment
in the thick bushes of the garden... A gigantic grey shape roared
around the road-bend, skidded to a halt. The menacing thrum
throttled down to the familiar throb of a motor, and a remembered
profile was limned by dim dash-lights.</p>

<p>"Kurt," Emma called. "Kurt!" The name was a sob in her throat as
she shot into the hall. She was across the verandah, and running
through the garden. "Kurt Tradin!" Briars snatched at her, murky
foliage; a low-hanging tendril whipped stingingly across her cheek
and some furtive thing scuttered out of her path. "Don't go away,
Kurt. Don't."</p>

<p>SHE had reached the car, was clutching its sill with both hands.
Gaunt-visaged, somehow older than when he had laid suit to her in
the shy manner of a country swain, Kurt Tradin peered at her. His
slow smile was tinged with some strange apprehension. "Em. Emma
Sprool! Be you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Kurt, why isn't Gram buried?"</p>

<p>"Why <i>what?</i> He half-rose from his seat, shoving toward
her. "She was! I see her laid to rest myself, in the
graveyard."</p>

<p>Emma's last faint hope vanished. Her nails dug into the auto's
steel, her throat worked. Then&mdash;"But she isn't. She's in
there, in the parlor."</p>

<p>Kurt's lips were ashen. From above the lumping of his high
cheekbones wormlike lights crawled in the depths of his shy eyes.
"In&mdash;the parlor," he husked. "Almighty Godfrey! They knew ye
was a-comin', then! Christopher, I'm glad I come out to see if you
was here, like I done every dusk the past week."</p>

<p>"In God's name! Kurt! What is going on here?" Kurt's stalwart
frame, his big-boned, handsome countenance, wavered in Emma's
vision as though a heat-haze screened them. "Who&mdash;what knew I
was coming?"</p>

<p>The young farmer seemed to have difficulty in forming words; his
gnarled hand was trembling. "We&mdash;don't know. Whut-ever it is
thet's been prowlin' the nights since yer gran-maw was buried. Grey
things in the hills thet ain't shaped like man nor beast."</p>

<p>"Grey things!" Emma thought of the anguished horse and the thing
that, hanging beneath its belly, had reached gruesome tentacles for
its throat. "I saw one! It killed my horse, out here?"</p>

<p>"Yer hoss!" He rapped the syllables out, and a little muscle
twitched, once, in his cheek. "They've killed more nor
hosses&mdash;Gaffer Wilson, an' Ely Trenholm's Iry an' Alice, an'
Spad Perkins' hull family when they tried ter get out along Big Tom
Highway. Thet's why I bin watchin' fer you to warn you not to stir
out o' the house after sundown."</p>

<p>Emma did not hear that last sentence. "Big-Tom
Highway&mdash;Kurt! Are they&mdash;is there any danger on that
road?"</p>

<p>He laughed shortly, without humor. "Danger! Thet's whar they was
first seen&mdash;an' thar ain't ary one got through thar by night
fer three days. Spad's outfit was the last ter try. Jed Harker an'
me found what was left o' them." Horror flaring in his eyes spoke
volumes. "The car wasn't hurt aytall 'cept'n the gas tank was
ripped open? We buried 'em quick, an'&mdash;" Once more a hesitant,
quivering pause. "An' found their graves open the next mornin',
open an' empty."</p>

<p>The girl swayed. Her lips parted, but no word came from them.
Kurt's smoldering gaze was fixed on her, and his voice was a hoarse
croak. "No one's come in or out of Ekwanok by night, since then.
Not by night... Though by day thar's been plenty agoin' till thar
ain't but a half-dozen families left in the valley... Whoa up,
Emmy!" He seemed to notice the girl's state for the first time,
grabbed for her wrist just in time to keep her from sliding to the
ground as her knees gave way. "What...?"</p>

<p>Emma squeezed speech through her tight throat. "That's the way
Milton is coming&mdash;maybe tonight."</p>

<p>"Milton?"</p>

<p>"My husband." She recalled that his letter had been addressed to
Emma Sprool. "I'm married. Kurt. We had given up our room, had the
car packed and ready to start for here, when someone sent for him
to audit an account. It meant twenty dollars, the first in months;
he couldn't turn it down. It was cheaper than a hotel for me to
come by rail to Kingville. No one would drive me here, but I
borrowed a horse. Milt said he would leave as soon as he
finished&mdash;perhaps tonight. Tonight! <i>And he is coming by Big
Tom Highway!</i>"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;husband..." The syllables dripped from Tradin's
twisting mouth; evidently he had heard nothing else. "Husband."
Life drained from his broad-sculptured visage; his eyes were dead
things, and his upper lip trembled like a hurt child's. His
shoulders slumped. There was something abject about his big frame.
Emma had seen him thus once before, when old Jeremiah, her
grandfather, had flayed with cutting words the yokel who had
aspired to mate with a daughter of the Sprools. "I&mdash;<i>Great
Jumpin' Godfrey!</i></p>

<p><i>Someone had screamed, far down the road. Some thing&mdash;for
there had been nothing</i>' human about that high-pitched wail of
agony. The girl twisted to it, her heart pounding to the anguish,
the utter terror in that cry&mdash;and it came again. Tradin's hand
was on her shoulder, was shoving her away. "Git in th' house, Emmy.
Git inside an' keep the door locked."</p>

<p>She jerked away. "But you, Kurt. You..." His face was set, his
sleepless eyes ablaze, "Come with me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't," he snapped through tight, white lips. "I&mdash;maybe
I'll get 'em this time. All week I've been too late. But thet
warn't fur away..." Motor roar drowned his voice&mdash;faded to let
him shout, "Quick, Em. Git inside an' let me go"</p>

<p>His urgency got her started; panic spurred her, and she was
hurtling through tangled brush that ripped and fought to hold her
back. Her feet thumped on the creaking porch. As the door pushed
open before her frantic rush she heard the farmer's car dart away.
She slammed the portal. Musty dark swallowed her as she fumbled
for, and found, the great bolt and shot it rattling into its
socket.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE TERROR IN THE
WOODS</h2>

<p class="first">THE mutter of the speeding car died in the
distance. Emma moaned. A pulse throbbed in her temple and a steel
band constricted her chest. She was alone in the blackness. Outside
an unnamable doom prowled, and here within was the cadaver that
earth and the worms had rejected. She was <i>not</i> alone! Livid,
marrow-melting fear companioned her, breathed on her its icy
breath. To stay in this house were to face a hell of terror, to
flee into that outer dark peopled by the grey menace a prospect
unthinkable. A spasm twisted her slender body and her small fists
beat against the door-panel in frantic protest. Why had he let her
come here alone? Why had Milton...</p>

<p>New terror clamped grisly fingers at her throat. Milton might
even now be climbing the pass, might be entering unwarned the
macadam snaking along Big Tom's flank where the grey Things waited.
"No! He's still working. Oh, God! Please make him still be working.
Please let me phone him not to come." Phone! The telephone was in
the parlor; she would have to brush close by the gaunt, terrible
casket to get to it!</p>

<p>The girl whimpered as she pushed herself away from the wall. To
save her own life she could not have entered that sepulchral
chamber, but for Milton&mdash;for the man she loved!...</p>

<p>Straight through sightless blackness Emma strode, across the
hall, into that fearsome chamber so strangely a sepulcher. Unseen,
unseeable entities slid soundlessly from her advance, gathered
behind in watching balefulness. The coffin-edge scraped her side to
ripple her flesh with crawling revulsion. She sensed the wall
before her, groped for the box of the rural phone, the tiny handle
of the magneto. Gasped as the wire-whine in her ear told her the
line had not yet been disconnected.</p>

<p>A startled man's voice grated in the receiver. "Almighty
Godfrey, Mariar. Et's the Sprool house&mdash;" The Ekwanok exchange
was in Elmer Barmes' kitchen. Then, "Who is&mdash;" A click snapped
short Elmer's question, clogged the line-sound in Emma's ear...</p>

<p>"Hello," she panted. "Hello..." And knew that she was not heard.
In that moment, in that very moment the wire had snapped,
somewhere&mdash;<i>or malevolently been broken!</i> "Elmer!" the
girl screamed, despairingly. "Elmer!..."</p>

<p>The receiver dropped from Emma's flaccid hand. She heard it
thump against the wall, dully, heard the tiny rattle of dislodged
plaster behind the laths. Her lips formed words they did not utter.
"God&mdash;help me." God had turned his face from the valley, from
her. But&mdash;but perhaps Milton would not come tonight. Perhaps
his work would keep him so late that he would wait till
morning.</p>

<p>She grasped at the faint hope, even knowing that his longing to
rejoin her would drive him to complete with all possible speed the
task that held him from her. This was their first separation since
they had become man and wife&mdash;sometimes the fierceness of
their love frightened her&mdash;and he would be eager to end it...
No, at whatever hour he was free he would start out.</p>

<p>Maybe he had started, maybe he was there now, high up on Big
Tom. <i>Why had the phone connection been broken except to stop her
very warning?</i> But they wouldn't know about telephones, the
pallid killers prowling the highway. Of course not. She laughed,
but the short sound of her laugh was not pleasant. How silly she
was. How silly. The rural wires often went out of commission...</p>

<p>A dim vibration crept to her ears through the darkness, a
far-off thrum, the infinitely distant, sound of a coming car. Help
was coming&mdash;Kurt was coming back to help her! He would take
her to the village, to another telephone. Without seeming volition
she was again at the window from which she had first glimpsed
horror. She peered out, up the road toward Kingville whither
Tradin's car had catapulted on its wild chase. Nothing save
impenetrable dark.</p>

<p>But that vague burr of a speeding motor still sounded. It pulled
her eyes up, up along what she could not see but knew was the slope
of Big Tom, up to where the road must be where the horse had
screamed and died. A star showed&mdash;but that tiny light was too
low to be a star&mdash;and it was moving! It must be an auto
headlight then, the light of an auto coming along Big Tom
Highway...</p>

<p>The staring girl's hands closed on the window-sash at either
side, while thought stopped and her skull was a void seared by the
query she dared not think. Whose car? Oh dear Lord! Who drove that
car?</p>

<p>The light split to two tiny specks. Some curve in that
far-flung, high road sliced their beams to double dashes of yellow
against the dark billow of foliage, one luminant streak canted
upward and distinct from the other. Emma's hands clawed, raked down
old wood, paint flaking and stabbing into the quick of nails that
scraped it. She was answered. Oh merciless God, she was
answered!</p>

<p><i>Those were the lights of Milton's roadster.</i> Unmistakably.
He had tugged at that up-bent lamp, trying to straighten it, only
this morning...</p>

<p>"Milt!" she screamed. "Go back, Milt! Go back! If you love me,
Milt, go back!" He could not hear, of course he could not hear.
<i>"Milt!"</i> Why could he not hear? Why could he not sense her
anguished soul shrieking its warning to him across the miles?
"<span class="smcap">Milton</span>!"</p>

<p>Steadily the twin beams moved across the vast screen of
blackness. They seemed to be drifting infinitely slow, but Emma
knew the speed at which they moved. A flash of inner vision showed
her Milt's ascetic, dear face bent slightly forward over the wheel,
the wind of his passage sweeping his hair back from his high, clear
forehead, his brown eyes eager. He would be calculating the minutes
still between them. His arms would be aching for the feel of her in
their embrace. Her own breasts ached in answer... Dear Mother of
Mercy, protect him!</p>

<p>His love was hurtling him on to doom!</p>

<p>Across the vast night that had engulfed the world those tiny
lights floated with even pace. Hours seemed to pass and some dim
hope stirred in Emma's aching bosom. Kurt was wrong. Perhaps Kurt
was wrong. Perhaps the Things in their descent on the valley had
relaxed their watch of the highway. Milton was getting through. He
<i>must</i> get through. He would.</p>

<p>In minutes now he would reach the place where the horse had
died&mdash;right there&mdash;he would reach and pass it. Of course
he would pass it. That would be the test. If Milt passed that spot
he would be all right. He would surge down the hill, down into this
connecting road that ribboned before the house, would honk his horn
for her and she would be at the gate, on his running-board, in his
embrace. In seconds now she would know. In seconds. He was almost
there. He was there. He would pass&mdash;</p>

<p><i>His lights were gone!</i> In that instant, in that very
instant when he had reached the spot where instinct had told her
the greatest danger lurked, his motor had sputtered,
stopped&mdash;and his headlights had blinked out as if a black
shroud had dropped over them! As if a shroud&mdash;his shroud...
The Things had him! The grey Things had swarmed over her husband,
her lover...</p>

<p>It was then that madness first probed gruesome lingers into the
girl's brain. Glass crashed as she smashed the window before her
with flailing, frantic fists. Keen, jagged shards gashed her
jacket, her arm, as she clambered through. She was out in the
garden, was smashing through tangled, wild shrubbery she felt but
could not see. She was across the road, had plunged into thick
woods that lifted under her feet, lifted and became the high slope
of Big Tom.</p>

<p>She was climbing that slope, blindly, climbing to the highway
above. Climbing to Milton, to help him against the grey death. To
die with him if he were dead. To die whatever horrible death he
suffered. Or save him. That was it, she would save him. She would
drive the grey Things away from her lover with the very fury of her
love.</p>

<p>The sound of her wild passage was a tumult in the silent forest.
She caromed off a black tree trunk, plunged on. A trailing vine
coiled around her ankle, tripped her. She slammed down. In the
moment she lay gasping something rustled the carpeting of dead
leaves, close by. She pulled herself erect, staggered on. The woods
tore at her, would not let her pass. Snarling, like some creature
of the wild, she fought it, fought through.</p>

<p>The way grew steeper, sapped her strength. She was moving more
slowly now, but would not stop. Rock-face rose sheer above her: she
found hand-holds, niches for straining toes, inched upward. Her
labored breathing, the scrape of her toes against the stone, were
the only sounds she made.</p>

<p>But there was another sound in the woods, though she did not
hear it. The stealthy sound of a furtive something that slithered
through the underbrush...</p>

<p>Her reaching hand found dank earth at the brow of the cliff she
climbed. She was up and over, lay panting on its very brink, face
down over its edge where the air her laboring lungs needed was
unimpeded. She pulled dampness into her aching thorax,
fungus-smell, odor of rotting leaves. And another
stench&mdash;alien, shuddersome&mdash;like nothing she had ever
smelled. Infinitely menacing.</p>

<p>A patch in the blackness below was queerly lighter,
somehow&mdash;a patch that moved to the base of the rock she had
climbed. It was a pallid, formless shape that moved oddly, flowing
like&mdash;like the greyness that had ebbed from a tawny still heap
that had been a horse, like the grey horror-thing that had seeped
into the woods&mdash;to wait for Milton. It was climbing now,
climbing to reach her, grey-black tendrils reaching for her... Her
breathing stopped and an abortive scream retched her throat, was a
soundless gust...</p>

<p>She surged to her feet, and was blundering again through
tight-laced undergrowth, through ripping brambles and whipping thin
branches that lashed at her. Moist mold was slick under her feet:
stones rolled, twisting her ankles. The forest was on the side of
the noisomeness it had borne, was striving to hold her for that
which pursued. God was against her&mdash;no, God had forgotten her,
had forgotten Milton. God had abandoned them to Satan's spawn.</p>

<p>Emma crashed against an invisible tree-trunk, clung to it,
momentarily stunned, saw the weird evil that followed her closer
now. It seemed to move so slowly, yet it was closer. Terribly
close. She was running again, fleeing the terror. Her clothing was
in tatters, her white skin ripped and bleeding. Her body was an
intolerable ache, her veins an icy network. But she climbed,
climbed endlessly toward where the highway cut through primeval,
lush timber, toward where Milton needed her. <i>Milton!</i> Good
God! She was leading another of the creatures to him, she was
bringing him not help but sure destruction!</p>

<p>The thought halted her, jerked her around to face that which she
fled. If it took her, if she gave herself to it, would it be sated?
Feeding on her would it be kept from joining the attack on Milt?
There it was, an inexorable billow of menace, eddying effortlessly
through the tangle that it had cost her so much to
penetrate&mdash;coming for her with a strange quietude, certain of
overtaking her, certain of its prey...</p>

<p>The darkness here was absolute, yet she could see it, see its
vague greyness, like a faintly luminous small whirl of mist
emanating from the very ground. Against its vague light gaunt boles
were silhouetted, trunks springing straight to the sky or twisted
by some injury to a frail seedling. By all that was holy, she
recognized the grotesque knotting of one gnarled oak! She
remembered wandering here in the woods as a child, finding an
abandoned loggers' cabin near that U-shaped trunk... A cabin! Was
it still there?</p>

<p>Emma twisted, sped away. Ten, a dozen steps and she saw it, a
dark, welcome bulk, slab-sided. Saw it and felt a clammy cold touch
on her back where jacket and blouse had been stripped away! Her
body exploded into a long, terror-winged leap into the musty
closeness of the long deserted shelter. Miraculously she found a
door and slammed it shut against a soft, squashy bulk.</p>

<p>She heard the soft slither of groping tendrils against the wood,
dug heels into the earthen floor and shoved aching, bare shoulders
against the barrier to hold it against the sleazy surge of that
which sought entrance. She felt the dig of a bar into her back,
fumbled behind her and shoved it into a stout, angle iron riveted
through the jamb. Then she slid, utterly spent, down along the
splintered panel&mdash;lay, limp and gasping, at its base.</p>

<p>The fetor of the Thing threaded through still space, a
putrescence of something rotting that initially was foul. The sound
of its groping was doughy, horribly without stiffness. Clammy-cold
as the slimy touch she still felt on her back where momentarily it
had contacted her. Somehow blind&mdash;as though the sense by which
it had trailed her had been not sight but an uncanny attribute of
an entity from beyond the Pale. Sliding sound whispering of evil
incarnate; livid, quivering evil.</p>

<p><i>What was that?</i>
</p>

<p>Dully, almost beneath the level of hearing, another sound had
come out of the forest night, like the shout of a human voice, far
off. The Thing must have heard it too, for now it was quiescent,
suddenly unmoving. Utter stillness fell&mdash;to be shredded by a
high, shrill wail that clawed Emma's quivering nerves with gelid
talons of new and supernal terror.</p>

<p>The fearsome ululation rose, and died away. And
then&mdash;realization pulled the girl up to a sitting posture, her
icy hand at her frozen lips&mdash;that which had groped for
entrance against the saving door of her refuge was gliding away.
She could hear it&mdash;the rustle of its ungainly weight out
there&mdash;then it was gone.</p>

<p>It was gone and she was safe. But who was it that had shouted,
briefly? Who could it be but Milton? No other human was near enough
to be heard. He was alive, still alive, crying for help! And the
Thing had abandoned its efforts to get at her in response to the
weird call of its mate! It was hastening, even now, to join in the
attack on Milton.</p>

<p>Awful certainty pulled the staggering, half-naked girl to her
feet... Somewhere out there in the gruesome night, her husband was
in deadly peril. Somewhere out there&mdash;but where? Oh God!
<i>Where?</i> The answer flashed on her. She had <i>seen</i> the
cabin, where all else had been darkness, had seen it silhouetted
against a narrow paling of the blackness. That lighter strip
against the gloom could be only Big Tom Highway, the turnpike along
which, she had seen Milton's lights drift and blink out, the road
from which his cry for help had come. He was near&mdash;very
near?</p>

<p>It was not Emma Wayne whose slow hand sought the great bar that
locked that door against terror and shoved it back. It was the
frenetic errantry of a woman whose loved one was in peril, the
incomprehensible devotion of the female who would defy Lucifer
himself for her mate...</p>

<p>Cold air was about her as the portal creaked open, the dank
chill of the night still tainted by the fetor of corruption. She
was out in the open, in an oppressive silence that held in its
jetty womb muted sounds of a struggle: the heavy breathing of a
strangling man; the thumping of tossed, heavy bodies, boneless and
horrible.</p>

<p>Emma turned her head against neck-muscles that were taut,
resistant bands, saw the pale glimmer of the road, yards away
through the trees. Saw the familiar outlines of a cheap roadster
against the wan light&mdash;and beside it, an amorphous mass that
heaved sickeningly, heaved up, settled again!</p>

<p>"Milton!" she shrieked. "Milton!"</p>

<p>The formless, grey-luminant mound seemed to swirl, to break
apart. A shape flicked into being at its center, an upsurging
figure of a man. Emma glimpsed the pale oval of a face, heard the
guttural mutter of a cry in what might have been Milton's voice.
Then he was down again under the upheaval of the attackers...</p>

<p>Briars tore at her, unseen branches lashed at her. She was on
the road, was leaping toward the struggling mass. She had reached
it, was tearing at it with desperate hands, was tearing away
handfuls of viscid, doughy stuff that stunk to high heaven. The
stuff clung to her fingers, clogged them. Beneath the mound Milton
choked and struggled.</p>

<p>A thick, gluey tentacle rose toward her, coiled around her
waist. It was dragging her down, irresistibly down into that
corruption. She beat at it and her fists smacked into wet, cold
softness that gave like wet and sticky clay. She sank into the
noisome mound. Its foulness was in her mouth, was clammy against
her nostrils. She could not breathe...</p>

<p>Within the maelstrom that was her ego she whispered, "Milton.
With you. In death as in life..."</p>

<p>Something screamed through the darkness that swept into her
brain...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; MADMEN'S DANCE</h2>

<p class="first">IT ISN'T right, Emma thought petulantly. When
you're dead you ought to stop hurting. It was as if she were still
in that body of hers that glass and the forest brambles had sliced.
Pain seared her everywhere, and her chest was an aching hollow.</p>

<p>"Emma! Darling!" Milton's voice cried from out the depths.
"Emma!"</p>

<p>It was all right then; he was in the same place to which she had
gone. They would be together through eternity. Something stroked
her forehead&mdash;it was his trembling hands. Even here they
thrilled her. Would the sight of him thrill her too? Emma dared to
look.</p>

<p>A green light bathed him, and his face was contorted, anxious.
"Milt, dear," she said weakly. "Don't look so worried. Nothing can
happen any more."</p>

<p>"Oh God! Oh thank God! You're alive! I thought..."</p>

<p>The girl's lips moved weakly. "Alive? Oh Milt?"</p>

<p>His kisses were cold on her mouth, icy cold. The grey stuff
streaking his cheeks was clammy against her.</p>

<p>Another voice said gruffly, from somewhere in the eerie light,
"Come on. Let's get out of here 'fore them Things come back."</p>

<p>Past Milton's shoulder she saw Kurt Tradin standing over them,
ashen-visaged, gun in hand, looking fearfully into tall shadows
enclosing his headlight beam. And Milt had a gun. Matters became
real again. She was alive. She was lying in the dust of Big Tom
Highway, and her husband was kneeling beside her, holding her in
his arms, kissing her.</p>

<p>She pulled away from him. "What&mdash;what happened?"</p>

<p>"God, Em, I'm not sure I know. I was pounding along, saw a dead
horse right across the road. Braked and got out to pull it out of
the way&mdash;then my car lights went out and something jumped me
from the trees." He pulled an arm across his sweat-wet, white brow,
and shuddered. "Something out of a nightmare. It had me down, was
smothering me, but I got my senses back in time to fight it off. To
<i>try</i> to fight it off. I couldn't get away from it. But it
couldn't quite down me either. I think I fought it for hours.</p>

<p>"Suddenly it yelled and another like it lumbered out of the
woods. The two ganged up on me and had me down. I was all through
when I heard you scream. That was like a jab from a red-hot iron. I
pulled away from them for a second, saw you coming, and then they
flooded over me again. But I knew I had to lick them then.</p>

<p>"For some reason one of them let go. I pounded at the other. I
must have found some vital spot, for the Thing screamed, squirmed
away from me. I got to my car, grabbed a gun from the side-pocket,
and turned to see both of them vanishing into the woods. You were
lying here, more dead than alive. I started for you when there was
the screech of a horn, and this gentleman came ripping around the
curve."</p>

<p>"This is Kurt Tradin, Milt," Emma said then, dazedly. "I've told
you about him. This is my husband, Kurt."</p>

<p>Tradin was strangely expressionless as he turned to her.
"Reckoned so. You two agoin' to stay here till the critters come
back? Ain't you had enough?" His tone was flat, dead, but little
lights crawled in his eyes. Was it fear?</p>

<p>"Right you are." Milt lifted Emma, carrying her up with him in
his strong arms. "Let's get going, friend."</p>

<p>He started with her toward the battered flivver.</p>

<p>"Better if we stick together," Kurt rumbled, not looking at
them. "Take mine, it's faster. We'll come back an' get your'n in
the mornin'&mdash;if we live to see the sun again."</p>

<p>Milt hesitated. "What do you mean?" he said sharply. "Why
shouldn't we live?..."</p>

<p>The farmer whirled to him, his face livid. "Jumpin' Jehoshaphat,
ain't you seen enough to know the hand of Beelzebub is heavy on the
valley? We're marked for damnation, all of us." His voice broke to
shrillness. "An' only the Lord's miracle kin save us. Get her in my
car, if you love her. Quick!" His arm jerked so that his revolver
was pointblank at Milt's midriff. "Quick! I ain't agoin' to risk my
neck for your foolishness."</p>

<p>Wayne shrugged and slid his wife into the back of Tradin's grey
limousine, came in alongside her. Kurt leaped for the front, was
under the steering wheel. His motor roared, gears clashed, and the
forest's dark loom whizzed by.</p>

<p>A vast weariness gripped Emma. She snuggled close against her
husband, immersed herself in his strength, the comforting aura of
his protection. She had him back. That was all that mattered. She
had him safe and with tomorrow's light they would leave here, leave
Ekwanok and its valley of dread...</p>

<p>Out there was still the night to get through. The dreadful
night. "Where are we going, Kurt? Where are you taking us?"</p>

<p>"To yer own house, quick's we kin get there."</p>

<p>Emma pushed up. "No, Kurt," she groaned. "No!" She was quivering
once more with the fear that first had found her there. "That's
where the Things..."</p>

<p>"Safest place in the valley," he growled, cutting her short.
"Worse in the village."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothin'. You'll see." Grimly. "We go through the
village."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the Sprool house, Emma?" Milton
interrupted, curiously. "I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's horrible, Milt. Gram's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God! Look at that! The place is on fire!"</p>

<p>The road had dipped, suddenly, and debouched between dark,
shuttered houses that were gaunt against a lurid glow from which
dancing sparks flew straight upward.</p>

<p>"No," Kurt grunted. "Not th' place." And they were darting
through the green Emma remembered as bordered by the staid facades
of churches, the white columns of the town hall. But the open space
was staid no longer. Great leaping red tongues of a huge bonfire
soared avidly from its very center, and, limned grotesquely against
it, a ring of prancing, black figures hopped, and gibbered, and
howled in wild antics. She quivered in revulsion at what a tall,
bearded man was doing. Distracted momentarily by their passing, he
turned&mdash;and wild eyes glared at them from a face she knew. The
incredible scene whipped behind them...</p>

<p>"Kurt," she gulped. "Kurt. That wasn't Dr. Potter. He
couldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yep," laconically. "Preacher o' th' First Presbyterian. That's
Ekwanok, Em, all that's left. Want to stay there tonight?"</p>

<p>She shuddered. "No. Mother to mercy, no!"</p>

<p>They curved around the jut of Big Tom; the village of the mad
was behind. A bridge rattled under their pounding wheels. The car
swayed, jounced as the macadam ended. Kurt's green headlight
stabbed through darkness again, darkness that blanketed grey
terror, but Emma welcomed it. Even the horror of the skulking
Things were better than that which she had just glimpsed.</p>

<p>"All them that's sane has went, a week ago," he said.</p>

<p>"All but you, Kurt. Why did you stay?"</p>

<p>"I was waitin' for you," he answered simply. "For you." There
was bitter despair in his tone. "You forgot what I promised, but I
didn't"</p>

<p>"Oh Kurt!" Emma remembered now the one stolen moment she had
given him to say good-bye, their one brief talk after grandfather
had forbidden them to see one another. "You'll come back, Emmy," he
had said. "Sure's shootin'. An' I'll be awaitin' for you." How
could she have forgotten the dreary hopelessness with which he had
thrown out his hands, and the dogged determination in his hurt
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Kurt," she said. She had really thought herself in
love with him, till she had met Milton and learned what love
was.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have risked it," she added.</p>

<p>"Risked!" Still that dulled bitterness. "I belong with
them."</p>

<p>"Isn't that the place?" Milton broke in. "There to the
left?"</p>

<p>Breath popped from Tradin's tight lips. "Yes." He braked,
swerved. His radiator crashed through the broken fence, the car
skidded through the garden, nosed the porch and stopped. "Git out
an' into the house. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Kurt's urgency lifted them out of their seats, out of the car,
and to the door. Milt shoved it open, but Emma turned.</p>

<p>"Kurt," she called. "Kurt! Aren't you coming in?"</p>

<p>"No." He was already in reverse, was surging backward. "Git
inside for God's sake."</p>

<p>He was in the road&mdash;was gone. Milton's grip was on her
wrist, pulling her inside. The door banged shut, and a flashlight
beam sprayed the gloom. But for an instant, the girl's mind was
tangled with a strange gesture the farmer had just made, a gesture
as of final farewell.</p>

<p>"Creepy old place&mdash;no wonder you left it." Her husband's
voice was unaccustomedly loud and harsh. She jerked to him,
reproach on her lips. "Remember where there's a lamp? We've got to
have light."</p>

<p>She saw his face dimly. It was infinitely weary, haggard. There
were black rings under his eyes. She choked back what she had been
about to say realizing the tension he was under. He was as afraid
as she, was dissembling, trying to be natural, in order to quiet
her. His hand, behind him, had already slipped the door bolt into
its socket, and the long whiteness of his flash-beam flickered
everywhere, probing the shadows. "There should be one on a table
behind the stairs." The light darted there. "Yes&mdash;and it's
filled."</p>

<p>"Here's some matches. I don't know how to work the thing." He
poked the paper folder at her, fumbled it into her hand. But he
kept close beside her as blue flame ran around the lampwick,
guttered, lifted to a steady glow within the replaced chimney.
Yellow luminance shoved back the shadows, Milt clicked off his
flashlight, managed a wan grin. "That's better. So this is the
Sprool mansion!"</p>

<p>Looking with his eyes Emma saw the curious old-fashionedness of
the house, even here in the hall, its threadbare assumption of a
dignity it had long lost. In Ekwanok they had always called it The
Mansion, had kowtowed to its inmates, even when the patriarch had
gone. Kurt had been no exception. His love-making had been a shy,
timorous, hopeless yearning for something above him.</p>

<p>"This is the Sprool homestead," Emma assented gravely, while her
glance slid to the parlor archway, tried to penetrate its
blackness, "where your wife was born and bred."</p>

<p>"What is it?" His exclamation was like ripping silk. "What are
you scared of, in there?" He had seen her look, had interpreted it
with the sureness of their intimacy. <i>"What's in there?"</i></p>

<p>"Nothing. Nothing that I'm afraid of." Two could play at that
game. "Gram's in there, in her coffin. They&mdash;they didn't bury
her."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! What were they waiting for? I never heard of&mdash;"
He started toward the doorway. Emma got her hand on his arm,
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said. "Time enough in the morning.
She&mdash;I&mdash;don't go in there. Don't!"</p>

<p>He gripped her shoulder, turned her to him, gently, but she
winced as pain stabbed down her arm. "Em. You're trembling all
over. You <i>are</i> afraid of something in there."</p>

<p>She made her eyes meet his, forced false frankness into them.
"There's nothing in the parlor except Gram's Coffin, with her in
it. I&mdash;I don't want you to go in there because I couldn't go
with you. I couldn't bear it, and I am afraid to be alone. Hasn't
there been enough to make me tremble, tonight?"</p>

<p>"Poor kid! I'll say there has." The harshness of his tone
mellowed, she was close against him and his mouth had found hers.
The rasp of his tightening arms on her lacerated, bare shoulders
was somehow sweet and she felt his fear-cold lips grow warm, then
burn, as the tight embrace fanned the spark of their love to
consuming flame. Terror was forgotten in that long moment, fear
ceased to brood. There was only the ecstasy of their oneness...</p>

<p>A soft thud behind froze her, the drag of a jell-like mass
across wood! Milt pushed her away, crouched, his eyes on the murky
entrance into the parlor, his automatic tight-gripped, snouting.
Syllables slid from his mouth that was suddenly a straight gash
across a humid mask. "Watch it, Em! There's someone in there and
I'm going in after him."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE COFFIN'S
MESSAGE</h2>

<p class="first">THE slow slither within the parlor that was a
cavern of dread stopped, but Emma's spine prickled to the sensation
of a baleful glare from the room's mystery, of fearful eyes glaring
as the new menace crouched to match Milt's taut crouch and waited
in ambush for his coming.</p>

<p>"No," she squeezed through the invisible fingers of fear
clamping her throat. "No. There can't be. There can't..."</p>

<p>Then she remembered the window she had smashed, the gap in their
defenses! "Don't Milt. Don't go in there. Please, Milt, don't!"</p>

<p>His eyes flicked to her, flicked back to stare ahead, but she
had seen into their lurid depths and was aghast. Milt! No! It
couldn't be <i>her</i> Milt's eyes into which she had looked in
that revealing instant! His upper lip lifted in a vulpine snarl. He
shrugged closer to the ground, lunged into the blackness, leaving
behind a low growl, the growl of an enraged dog. Leaving behind a
woman whose world had smashed about her bloody head, a woman shaken
to the very foundations of her being, utterly alone.</p>

<p>Shot-crash pounded dully to Emma's clogged ears; her dizzy sight
was aware only of an orange-red flash that illumined nothing. Muted
sounds of a terrific struggle were suddenly cut short, were
succeeded by an awesome silence, a silence pregnant with queasy
dread. There were furtive noises, sluggish movement, a whispering
frou-frou of satin. And again the slow dragging of something that
was neither human nor beast. Then stillness again, a stillness as
ebony dark as the blackness veiling whatever horror had come to
pass in there.</p>

<p>The girl came gradually to awareness that she was clinging to
the banisters, waist-high just there, that grave-chill stiffened
her limbs and corpse-smell was foul in her nostrils.</p>

<p>"No." she whispered. "Dear God. No."</p>

<p>There was no sound, sepulchrally no sound from the murk ahead.
She was mistaken in what she had read in Milton's final flickering
glace. She must have been mistaken. Of course she had been. The
hands she unclasped from the slender round of the banister-rods
seemed to creak, their joints paining. She must go in there. She
must go in there to see what had happened to him. What had the
Thing done to Milton, to her lover?</p>

<p>Her lover! She recalled the look in his eyes, and shuddered. Was
<i>she</i> going mad or...? But she must stop thinking. She had
stopped thinking, except just enough to pick up the lamp and make
her legs take her toward that parlor door.</p>

<p>The lamplight seemed tangibly to push back a wall of darkness
that resisted it. To push back <i>something</i> hidden by the
darkness, hidden by and eerily part of it. She was through the
archway and the lamp's luminance filled the room, thrusting the
darkness out through the gaping, jagged-edge window into the night
from which it came. Thrusting the Thing the darkness
hid&mdash;<i>not thrusting all of it!</i> In mid-air a shadow
floated, unmoving...</p>

<p>It was no shadow, it was the coffin, the black casket so weirdly
exhumed. The macabre object pulled Emma's look to it, pulled with a
shuddersome fascination she could not resist. It seemed to have a
message for her, a message of doom.</p>

<p>She fought the gruesome drag, drove searching eyes about the
musty chamber, over age-patinaed furnishings long-familiar yet
uncannily strange, into far corners, along the scrub-whitened floor
islanded by the faded rag rugs Gram's fragile hands had worked.
Stiff and decorous the parlor was as ever&mdash;empty, stark,
staringly empty. Glass splinters still in the broken window were
edged with grey stuff. But where was Milton? Oh God! Oh merciless
God! <i>Where was Milton?</i></p>

<p>Was that the message Gram had for her? Would she tell, her old
grandmother, stiff and dead in the casket They had not let rest?
Gram would help her in her agony. Gram, always so fluttering-kind
despite her tight-lipped grimness. She would go and ask Gram where
Milton was.</p>

<p>Emma's feet whispered across the floor, and her light grew
stronger on the casket, grew stronger and yet somehow was swallowed
by the dull black of its grave-smeared sides. Emma was at the
coffin side, but her eyes had jerked themselves closed as she
reached it. Why did she fear to look into the box where lay all
that was mortal of Faith Sprool? Why did she fear to look, save for
dread of the message she was strangely aware it held for her?</p>

<p>She&mdash;must&mdash;know! Still with shut eyes the girl lifted
the lamp, so that its rays would strike down, would strike surely
down into the uncovered coffin. So. Now she could take one swift
look and turn away. Now!</p>

<p>The face that stared sightlessly up at her from the coffin
pillow was not Gram's face. <i>Not Gram's!</i> Emma was a statue of
stone, gazing down at a drawn, thin-visage, well-conned but somehow
utterly strange. It was Milton, <i>Milton</i> whose corpse-hued
countenance lay on the white satin. <span class=
"smcap"><i>Milton!</i></span></p>

<p>Numbed, unbelieving minutes passed. Then the full horror reached
her brain, and a scream ripped from her inmost being, shuddered out
of that ghastly room, shrieked across the valley and was lost among
the night-shrouded trees. Another.</p>

<p>The echoes of those screams were mangled by the mountain-side,
were metamorphosed into a shrill laugh. The mountains were laughing
at her, the mountains whose lifelong threat had come at length to
full fruition. Big Tom was laughing at her...</p>

<p>Emma was laughing too. Shrilly, unendingly. Laughing from a
wide-open mouth that drooled, from a body contorted into a
backward, spasm-twisted arc. Laughing while icy tears rolled down
her face that was a network of tiny, quivering muscles, splashed
from a little chin blurred by its tremors, wet a blood-wealed bosom
racked by awful sobbing.</p>

<p>Even the stars might have pitied her, in that moment, had they
not been shut out from the valley by the lid Lucifer had clamped
over it. Even the madmen who danced about the red bonfire in the
hidden village, had they heard her.</p>

<p>But there was none here to pity her. None in the desolate house
save he who lay so ghastly still, cramped in a box for the dead
that was too small for him, and could not hear her laughter or her
sobbing for him, for her lover?</p>

<p>Suddenly Emma's crazed laughter shut off, and her sobbing. Quite
suddenly as if some grisly hand had twisted a streaming faucet
shut. A crafty light crept into her eyes, and the tense rigidity
that gripped her body relaxed. The glance she shot around that room
was furtive; her free hand came up to her mouth and her forefinger
pressed against her lips with sly cunning. She tiptoed out of the
parlor, reached the hall, turned to the left where the light of her
lamp fell on another door. She was through that door. It closed
soundlessly and she was slinking with grotesque noiselessness
through a huge room walled with dark oak. A massive table gleamed
dully. Round plates were parti-colored circles on Dutch shelving
high up. The slinking girl mumbled something inaudible, crossed to
the gloomy loom of a carved buffet. The slide of drawer was a
barely audible hiss as she pulled it out and fumbled within...</p>

<p>She was returning now, and there was a knife in her hand&mdash;a
long carving knife whose steel flashed brightly, whose edge was
razor-keen. She reached the door, paused irresolutely, looked
helplessly from her hand that held the lamp to that which gripped
the knife, mumbled again. How to turn the doorknob? She nodded as
the solution came to her, set the lamp down on the floor.</p>

<p>They built well in the old days, and Jeremiah Sprool was
exacting. No gleam came through the door Emma had closed behind her
to shut off light from the forgotten lamp, no gleam at all. Utter,
darkness was around her as she moved with the silent
sure-footedness of long usage. Utter darkness&mdash;in the hall, in
the parlor&mdash;and in her mind.</p>

<p>After a while there was no sound, no slightest movement in the
ancient structure that once was so proud to house the Sprools.</p>

<p>On the porch running across the front of the Sprool Mansion a
board creaked to the pressure of a cautious foot. A figure,
silhouetted against the one bright window, froze to immobility.
Nothing but that oblong of light indicated that the house was
anything but a shell enclosing only death. The prowler moved again.
Faint clink of metal against metal was quickly hushed, well-oiled
hinges made no sound, and the porch was once more vacant.</p>

<p>In the foyer of the years-worn dwelling the tomb-like odor of
rotted flowers lay heavily, brooding its conquest. But another
scent trailed across that corruption, the warm, charnel taint of
fresh blood. The intruder sighed, and infinite weariness was in the
brief, quivering exhalation.</p>

<p>"Em," he called in a hushed tone. "Emmy. Whar are ye?" A pause,
broken by no answering voice. Then, more sharply, "Emmy Sprool.
Don't be afraid. Et's Kurt. Kurt Tradin."</p>

<p>Still no response. Breath hissed from between tightened teeth.
Groping feet shuffled, the knob of the dining-room door rattled
sharply to the touch of a seeking hand, rattled again as it turned.
A vertical bar of light leaped into being, blotted by the farmer's
stalwart form. Alarm was in his voice now.
"Em&mdash;<i>Jehoshaphat!</i>"</p>

<p>The exclamation was wrenched from him as movement thudded, from
behind him, from the vaulted dark of the parlor. He
whirled&mdash;to see a white figure leaping at him, to see a face
distorted, glaring eyes, gleaming blade of a knife arcing at him.
His arm jerked up before his face, took the slash of the blow,
spurted blood. The girl avoided the clutch of his other hand,
slashed again. Missed. Laughed shrilly, so that Kurt's flesh
crawled. Bored in again.</p>

<p>His teeth gritted. God! He struck at her. She was a wraith,
flitting away, out of the beam slitting through the dining-room
door. She was somewhere in the dark; the sound of her mad laughter
came from everywhere, from nowhere. She leaped at him from the
dark, her knife sliced his cheek. He flailed at her, his fist found
its mark of soft flesh. And she laughed again. Horribly.</p>

<p>She was gone again in blackness. He followed, reaching out for
her, trying to find her. "Emmy. Girl. Whar are ye?"</p>

<p>Cold wind swept in, chilling him. And the great door slammed.
Tradin was at it, was wrenching it open. Somewhere out there she
crashed through brush, laughing.</p>

<p>"Emmy! Et's out thar! Come back. <i>For God's sake, come
back!"</i></p>

<p>Emma Wayne was crashing through underbrush that ripped her, tore
her almost nude body. There was something in her hand&mdash;a knife
it felt like&mdash;a knife whose hilt was slippery with&mdash;Oh
God!&mdash;with viscid, warm blood. An instant ago she had been
standing over Gram's coffin, looking down into it, seeing Milt's
dead and ghastly face where Gram's should have been.</p>

<p>How had she come here? Why was she running? From what? Why was
she laughing&mdash;<i>merciful Heavens</i>&mdash;why was she
laughing so shrilly? Her hand went to her throat, pressed. Pressed
the laughter to an end. But she was still running, blindly. There!
Now she was standing still, in the dark that was so black it
oppressed her, standing still in the frightening night.</p>

<p>Fear was back on her like a flood. Fear of herself, of the
creature that dimly she knew she had been&mdash;for how long? Fear
of the dark. Fear of the madness that stalked the dark. <i>Fear of
the Things, the grey and grisly Things to whom the night
belonged!</i></p>

<p>They were here, out here somewhere, and she was out with them!
In the house, at least, they could not get at her. Could they not?
What was it then that Milton had fought in the lightless parlor?
What was it that had killed him, had crammed him into the casket?
That had been her fault. Hers. Because she had forgotten the
smashed window. But she had waited for It to come back,
had&mdash;Now what made her think that? The bloody knife? <i>Whose
blood was it?</i></p>

<p>"Emmy." A far-off voice was calling her. "Come back. Emmy."</p>

<p>She turned to the call. She was high up on the mountain-side.
Down there, where the voice came from, a dimly yellow rectangle
must be the door of the house. It framed a dark, familiar figure.
Kurt's. Kurt&mdash;dear Kurt had come back to help her, was looking
for her. She must go back to him. Quickly.</p>

<p>But she <i>couldn't</i> go quickly. The brambles were thick
here, would not let her pass. She was sheathed in pain, every flick
of a leaf against her torn flesh was agony. The scrape of rough
bark, the tearing of thorns were sheer, exquisite torture. She
whimpered with pain, with grief, with the fear that was growing on
her again after the momentary relief that had come to her with her
glimpse of Kurt Tradin's stalwart form. Every lumping of shadow in
the blackness about her was a new threat, every minuscule rustle a
new terror. She was on the hillside sloping down from Big Tom's
mighty flank, in the thicket where the Things roamed. The grey and
grisly Things whose touch was fearful death.</p>

<p>Why didn't Kurt come for her? Why did he stand there,
motionless, peering into the night?&mdash;But he didn't know she
was there, she hadn't answered his call. Her larynx swelled to cry
out, her throat rasped with the coming sound.</p>

<p>And clamped on it, choking it back, as there arose before her,
right before her, the same shrill, unearthly wail that had summoned
the Thing from her cabin refuge to join in the lethal attack on
Milt. High, and higher; knife-edged with appalling menace;
glutinous somehow despite its shrillness, as though the ululation
were being forced through some awful viscidness; it
soared&mdash;and checked. Checked as earth pounded, as underbrush
surged away and monstrous greyness lunged at her out of the
night.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; "YES, I KILLED IT."</h2>

<p class="first">EMMA screamed, slashed at the Thing with her
knife. Instinctively. The blade felt something, something that took
its stroke with a queasy softness like no animal, no human flesh;
only barely resisting the plunge of the steel. The girl's arm
jerked hack for another blow, the knife soughed as it came out of
its unreal billet. She slashed again. The Thing towered above her.
It was falling on her reckless of her desperate stabs, was
overwhelming her with its doughy, putrid mass. She went down under
its nauseating bulk. Its noisome lump flowed shudderingly over her,
pressing clammy, wet coldness into her nostrils, her mouth, into
the hollow between her breasts.</p>

<p>This foulness wasn't real, couldn't be real. She couldn't
breathe, couldn't see, but primal instinct&mdash;for life, primal
clinging to existence, sparked her muscles with a furious
supernatural energy. She heaved herself up against the noisomeness,
drove her fists and her knees into it. It gave. Horribly it gave
and as her back arched in a spasmodic attempt to throw it off it
flowed underneath, so that its damp and gruesome chill slimed every
inch of her frantic body. Even in that moment, even in the red fury
of her hopeless battle, her skin crawled with revulsion and her
stomach retched.</p>

<p>The boneless, formless Thing held her clamped in its foul
embrace, investing her with its corruption, making her a part of
its putrescence. Her lungs pulled, pulled, and could get no air.
Searing pain racked her chest. The clayey mass that had swallowed
her tightened, tightened an inexorable, crushing band about her
threshing body. Anguish burst in her darkened brain, exploded into
a blaze of coruscating flame. Yellow pinwheels whirled against
velvety black, green meteors darted across their swirl, purple
rockets burst and blazed. Burst...</p>

<p>The Thing shrieked, and suddenly let go its hold, so that she
slid down, down, into swirling oblivion. Somewhere in vast
blackness a tiny glow was an infinitely distant pinpoint. It grew,
and as it grew its hard glow faded till it was the phantasmal,
pallid, sleeping face of her lost mate. Of Milton! Its eyes opened,
and Emma shrieked soundlessly as she saw in those eyes that look,
that darting, awful look with which he had left her, to die. Her
scream changed the bodiless head so that it wore Kurt's face,
drawn, haggard, with bloodshot, sleepless eyes deep-sunk in chasms
of weariness. She could not see his body, but she could feel his
toil-roughened hand on her shoulder, dragging her out of the
fathomless pit into which she had fallen. She could hear his voice
too, his muffled voice, calling her.</p>

<p>"Emmy. Emmy. Come back."</p>

<p>Why&mdash;didn't he leave her alone&mdash;in death? She had been
safe then. She had been rid of horror, of nameless terror, of pain.
Of PAIN. Of the agony that now scraped her skin with fire; clawed
her chest, her entrails. Of anguished knowledge that Milton was
jammed, wax-envisaged, into a coffin too small for him. Of the
memory of what she had seen in her lover's eyes. Now it was all
back. All! God! Why wasn't she dead? Why didn't he let her die?</p>

<p>"Emmy. Wake up."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened. Milton&mdash;no, Kurt. Kurt Tradin said, "Thank
God!" His bleak face was grey, but not as the Thing had been grey,
somehow not. His eyes were tired, so tired, and a muscle twitched
at the base of his broad nose. His sleeve was gashed, soaked with
clotted blood, and his gun was again in his hand. He was already
bending to her, he stooped nearer and his arms slid under her. His
strong arms closed about her, lifted her, and as she swung
effortlessly up she saw a grey, foul mass, motionless on the
ground.</p>

<p>"You killed it," she mumbled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he responded, and his accents were oddly thick. "Yes, I
killed it"</p>

<p>She understood now. Kurt had killed the Thing and saved her.
Kurt had saved Milton and her before, up there on the Highway. All
night, many nights, Kurt had been patrolling the roads, fighting
the grey horror, fighting the madness that the Things had brought
to the valley, to the village, to Milton. Fighting alone, always
alone. Why had not Kurt run away? Why had he stayed here to fight
his lonely battle?</p>

<p>He was climbing down, holding her, pushing through the brambles,
but he answered her, as though he had read her thoughts. "I love
you, Emmy." His tired voice was thick, broken. "I have waited for
you so long. So long."</p>

<p>"Hush," Emma said. "You&mdash;mustn't." She closed her eyes to
shut out the dreariness that made his lined face even more bleak.
"Not&mdash;yet"</p>

<p>The memory of Milton was too warm, too dear as yet. Even with
what she had read in his eyes between them. But later... Kurt's arm
cradled her so powerfully, so gently. She was so safe... so... Emma
sighed, slid into exhausted sleep.</p>

<p>Kurt drifted through her dreams, padding barefoot along the
dusty road from school, carrying her books. Kurt, standing, a dark
and somehow lonesome figure at the gate, watching her window whose
curtain he could not know veiled her responsive watching. Speaking
his love, haltingly, in a quiet dusk that for once was not gloomy
with dread. Kurt, in that last scene, that last but one, his
ungainly figure bowed, cringing beneath the awful blast of Jeremiah
Sprool's wrath. "Marry Emma," the old man roared. "Marry my
granddaughter! Put the taint of your blood into the veins o' the
Sprools! We're clean, Tradin. We're clean. By Jehovah, you're as
mad as the rest o' the valley. Mad as..."</p>

<p>The look on the young man's face had stopped grandfather there.
The lifeless look and the blaze in his dark eyes, the lurid,
flaming blaze whose agony had stilled even the ancient's unruly
tongue. But Kurt turned, blundered blindly out of the house. And
the dream ended with grandfather's gigantic figure in the doorway,
his voice recovered, shouting out into the night. "Mad, damn you.
Crazy. Crazy as a bat."</p>

<p>Emma had not been much frightened by Jeremiah's apoplectic rage;
his fits of uncontrolled temper were all too frequent. She had
waited for Kurt to return, had sent him messages despite the old
man's prohibition. But she had never spoken to Tradin again till he
had appeared, unexpectedly, at the station in Kingville, had husked
his promise to wait for her, and vanished before she could respond.
That incident too, was repeated in her dreams, and then her sleep
deepened to a dreamless torpor.</p>

<p>And she woke with a start. Bemused by her dreams and her sleep,
she could not for a moment tell the source of the welling tide of
fear that seemed to sweep up and over her in that instant of
waking. But fear lay on her breast like a leaden, oppressive hand,
and the shadows on the papered ceiling at which she stared were
dark shapes of brooding menace. She was on the old sofa in the
parlor, Gram would scold...</p>

<p>Memory seeped back, distorted, but full-panoplied with horror.
Gram was dead. Milton was dead, they were in the same coffin and
that coffin was in this room. Kurt...</p>

<p>Kurt was bending over her, it was his hand that was heavy on her
breast. Yellow lamplight, glancing at some odd angle across his
face made of it a shadowy <i>chiaroscuro</i> that was somehow
demoniac. His lips were too full, creepingly sensuous; his nostrils
pinched, quivering; tiny lights crawled wormlike in the abysmal
depths of his eyes. Emma fought down fright that plugged speech,
husked something. "Don't," she meant it to be. "Don't."</p>

<p>Tradin moved, and the girl came fully awake. It <i>must</i> have
been a trick of light and shade, the appalling mask his face had
been, for it was not like that any more. Contorted by emotion,
though&mdash;that it was, and ashen with fatigue. But his hand
<i>was</i> on her uncovered breast. "Don't," Emma repeated and
pushed at it feebly. It fell away. Released, she sat up, became
aware that he was kneeling beside her, that he was quivering. That
his lips were moving, were dripping passion-slowed words.</p>

<p>"Em. Em darling. I couldn't help it. I love you so."</p>

<p>Weakly, she swayed toward him, toward his reaching arms, though
deep within her a warning bell rang shrilly. With Milton so newly
dead! She was mad, <i>mad.</i> Her eyes slid over Kurt's shoulder,
across the room, appealing to the coffin where Milton lay for help
against this madness that ran riot in her veins. Queerly it seemed
to rock, to sway on its trestles.</p>

<p>Pale fingers came up out of the grim casket and gripped its
edge. A torso jerked upright, rising grotesquely from its ebon
depths and Milton's pallid, reproachful face turned toward her. His
arm lifted&mdash;the arm of a dead man&mdash;and his long,
bloodless hand clenched, opened, pointed at her in ghastly
accusation!</p>

<p>"Milton," she heard herself gasp. "Milton! I?"</p>

<p>Kurt exploded to his feet, blotting the grisly sight from her.
"You!" he screamed. "You!" and lunged toward the awakened dead, his
great fist lifting, knotting in the lamplight. "Damn you!" That
rocklike fist swept down...</p>

<p>Some power outside herself hurled Emma from the sofa, catapulted
her from its springs in a catlike leap to the enraged farmer's
back. Her shriek was a feline mewl as she raked Tradin's face with
the nails of her one hand and swiped at his descending arm with the
other&mdash;swiped aside that crushing blow to make it land on wood
instead of Milton's skull that it would have crushed.</p>

<p>Tradin was thrown against the coffin under the fury of her
onslaught, toppled it. It crashed thunderously, wood split. Emma
ripped nails again through flesh, gouged for eyes like the wild
thing she had become. Kurt ducked forward, suddenly. She flew over
his head, crashed among the splintered fragments of the casket. The
jagged wood of the smashed coffin ripped her, but its cushions of
funereal satin pillowed her fall. Her leg signaled excruciating
pain, and she could not move it. She squirmed over to the stamping
of feet, to the snarl of battling beasts.</p>

<p>A heaving mass reeled about the room, the two men locked in
tearing, primeval combat. Two men&mdash;oh God! Kurt was a man, but
the other&mdash;Milton. <i>What was he?</i></p>

<p>His slender form was so frail, so weak, against the other's
bulk. Ordinarily Tradin could split him in two, tear him apart with
those great paws of his that had wrestled so long with the soil.
Not now. Not that vibrant, terrible being who had returned from
death. Now that creature who bit, and tore, and kicked, was an
overpowering, black whirlwind that drove Kurt back, drove him back,
across the floor. No human being could stand against that snarling,
growling, squealing fury come back from the grave.</p>

<p>The whirlwind of combat struck the wall. Milton&mdash;whatever
it was that Milton had become&mdash;swarmed all over Tradin. But
the farmer, at bay, crouched and lashed out with his giant fists.
Lashed and landed. Milton was thrown back, was staggered. Suddenly
his figure was red with the tint of hell-fire, was wreathed in
black smoke, and he hurtled in again, hurtled at the embattled
rustic. Resistlessly the <i>revenant</i> drove Kurt along the wall
as the long, fluttering shadows of battle were lurid-edged. Emma
watching, was rigid with awed horror, with a fear that came from
beyond earth. The jagged void of the broken window gaped behind
Tradin; in the instant the girl realized that it had been his goal
he hurled himself backward through it, was gone.</p>

<p>Milton screeched blasphemy, vanished. Emma was not sure, not
quite sure, that he had gone through the window after his victim.
But gruesome thumpings came from outside, were succeeded by sudden
silence.</p>

<p>By silence that was broken by a strange crackling, here within,
by an ominous hiss. Milton had vanished, but a red glare still
danced in this parlor where horror had flared to unbelievable life,
and edged billows of greasy, black smoke. The stench of burning was
acrid in her nose, stung her throat. Good Lord! The place was
ablaze! Sometime in the whirlwind, eerie battle the table had been
overturned on which Kurt had set the lamp, and spilled oil on dried
old wood fed flames like kindling.</p>

<p>Emma sprang to her feet, toppled as agony stabbed her thigh,
crashed down to the floor. God! Oh God! Her leg was broken. She
could not stand. Could not run to escape the flames!</p>

<p>The fire spread rapidly now, having gained strength while she
watched the gruesome fight. The floor was a sea of wavering,
leaping orange, and red, and curling, spitting blue. The door was
cut off, by which she might have crawled to the foyer and out to
safety. Rivulets of flame ran between her and the window. A curtain
caught and flared.</p>

<p>Pungent smoke tore at her lungs with its black knives. Heat beat
at her, stinging. Long fingers of flame reached out across the
floor for her. She beat at them, beat them out with scorched,
blistering hands.</p>

<p>But the forefront of the main blaze roared closer, ever closer.
And she could not beat that back.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; DESCENT INTO HELL</h2>

<p class="first">ALL across the side and the front of the room, the
flames soared, incandescent, their glare blinding. The roar of the
fire was a vast surf, the surge of heat from its blaze was a great
wave overwhelming the helpless girl. A black pall of smoke eddied
along the ceiling, billowed, billowed lower and lower to engulf
her, to throttle her. Emma smelled burning hair&mdash;a viscous
insect stung her scalp&mdash;she snatched at the ember&mdash;tore
it from her head with a handful of her hair. She rolled away from
the flames, agonizing to the grating of fractured bone surfaces one
on the other&mdash;rolled against the furthest wall. Groveled
there, mewling, as inescapable destruction crept nearer with cruel
tongues.</p>

<p>Emma's skin crisped to the furnace blast beating on her doomed
body. She writhed in the searing heat, as a worm will writhe in
flame, and her arm flung over, thumped on the hot floor, thumped
against something that clinked metallically. She glared at what she
had touched, saw that it was the knife she had clutched out there
when Kurt had saved her from a more merciful death, red-shining
now, reflecting the blaze.</p>

<p>She snatched at the blade, seized it, clutching. The razor edge
slashed her palm, reddened with her blood, but she did not feel its
pain. It offered a better, more merciful death than the immolation
inevitable now in seconds. She pulled the knife toward her, dropped
it momentarily to gain a grip on its hilt, jerked the sharp point
to her breast. Poised it an instant while she muttered a prayer,
for the peace of her soul and of Milton's. Of Milton's that had
been brought back to his dead body to save her from unpardonable
sin. Then Emma's muscles tensed for the death stroke, and she shut
her eyes to take it.</p>

<p>The knife came alive, jerked from her grip. Unbelievably there
was someone in the room, bending over her. Someone! Oh God! Horror
was bending over her, horror worse than the knife or the flame. A
Thing bulky and formless, its grey orange-margined now by the
luminance of the roaring blaze.</p>

<p>It had come for her, come to take her for its own hideous
purpose, and it was not a being of this earth. No living thing
could have come through that holocaust alive? A lumping tendril
slapped across her face, a hot crust on it broke, and wet
viscidness squashed over her mouth, her nose and her eyes. She felt
another tentacle seethe under her, felt herself lifted, as she
writhed, feebly protestant, and her broken leg dangled to stab
agony up her thigh, her flank. She was crushed into the noisome,
viscid humidity of its foul mass. The stuff flowed over her,
swallowed her.</p>

<p>The Thing was moving, was carrying her off. Uttermost terror
shrieked in every cell of her anguished frame. Better the fire, oh
God, better the fire than this! It was carrying her through the
flame. She felt the vile stuff enveloping her grow hot to the fire,
heard the sizzle of steam. She could not breathe&mdash;could
not&mdash;</p>

<p>The matrix in which she was contained crawled, and somehow her
mouth was free, so that air reached her lungs; dank, cold air
freighted with corpse-smell. They were out of the fire then,
incredibly out, and the Thing was lumbering with her to its lair.
Somewhere in the mass a pulse beat, as if it had a heart. A heart
that pounded with some strange excitement, pounded with a rhythm of
grotesque life. The pud, pud in her ears was the muted beat of a
drum of doom.</p>

<p>The ungainly heaving that told her her captor still moved
ceased. She sensed that it had come to its journey's end, that it
had brought her to its lurking place, was about to work its will
with her. Fear ran icy in her blood stream, sapped all vitality
from her battered body as with a sucking plop she came free of the
Thing's foul substance and knew dimly that it had laid her down on
some hard, unyielding surface. Only pain kept consciousness in her:
the jabbing torture of her ruptured tibia: the agony of her
lacerated, scorched flesh. The thick stuff still adhering blinded
and deafened her. She lay unmoving where the Thing had laid her,
waiting. Waiting for the ultimate horror.</p>

<p>And a tenuous hope trailed across the quivering blank of her
beleaguered brain. Not for herself. For Milton, for her husband who
had died and yet was not dead. A hope that his reanimated body had
lost the hideous mockery of life with which she had last seen it
inflamed. That it was at rest, the body that had been so warm, so
near, so dear to her...</p>

<p>Nothing was happening, nothing at all. What was it waiting for,
the Thing that had relentlessly pursued her, harried her, that had
come through flames to take her? The agony of suspense expanded
like a black bubble, bursting her aching skull, till desperation
seized her and she drove a fist across her eyes, wiping away the
blinding mess.</p>

<p>Above her, redness glowed through a shimmering network
interlaced by things twisted, grotesque, reptilian. Bastions lifted
darkly about her to support that eerie roof. Where was she? In some
black chapel of the damned? In some Luciferean cloister through
whose pierced ceiling the reflection of hell's lurid fires
flickered restlessly in their eternal dance? Wherever she was, the
dull realization penetrated, whatever place this was, she was alone
in it. That which had brought her here had departed, on some
obscure, revolting errand of its own. She would stay here, it could
be sure of that, she would stay here till it returned.</p>

<p>Stay here? Grim humor twisted Emma's dry, cracked lips. Not she.
She couldn't walk with this poor shattered leg of hers that hurt so
damnably; but she could crawl. On hands and one knee she could
crawl. The Thing wouldn't find her here when it came.</p>

<p><i>Hurry!</i> It may be coming back now, right now.
<i>Hurry!</i> Turn over. Bite your lips against the screams that
tear at your throat as pain runs like liquid fire through every
quivering inch of you, and turn. So. That was the hardest part. Now
start crawling. Lift yourself on your pushing-down arms, get your
one good leg under you and a start. Never mind that other
leg&mdash;it isn't any good to you. Leave it. Leave it to mock the
Thing. <i>Hurry!</i> That far-off thud may be its gooey footfall as
it returns. But make no noise. Be silent as the grave. Stifle those
shrieks&mdash;they won't ease the pain and may warn the Thing that
you are escaping it. Ohhhhh. That was a bad one! <i>Hurry!</i></p>

<p>Something is dragging behind! Your other leg? Well, you haven't
time to pull it off, let it drag. You haven't time, the grey horror
will catch you if you stop for that. <i>Hurry!</i> Stop that
whimpering&mdash;crying won't help you. Stop it. You've gone a yard
now, a whole yard. Keep going. <i>Keep going!</i> how
long?&mdash;Never mind how long it has taken you to crawl that
yard, keep going. <i>Hurry!</i></p>

<p>No, that isn't Gram lying there, ahead, grinning at you. It
can't be Gram, she's dead? So are you dead? Don't fool yourself,
you wish you were. You couldn't hurt so if you were dead. You
wouldn't have to crawl through Hell if you were dead. But
<i>hurry!</i></p>

<p>Maybe Milton will be waiting for you when you <i>are</i> really
dead. In Hell? Perhaps. Hell itself burned in his eyes when he
looked at you before he lunged into the parlor and died. Stop
thinking&mdash;and crawl. <i>Hurry!</i> You have forgotten why you
were crawling, why you must hurry? Never mind, keep going. Don't
turn aside. Don't turn to get past the dark, low, mound across
whose end the red light flickers and makes you think its Gram's
skull-like face grinning at you. You've reached it now. Climb over
it. Climb! Put your hand on it and push over. It's cold, clammy. It
has the feel of cold, dead flesh! The brittle bones of its shoulder
crunch under your weight and its hand, its dead hand, jerks up and
slaps you stingingly across the face...</p>

<p><i>It is Gram!</i> Oh God! Oh dear God! It is Gram!</p>

<p>Emma&mdash;the quivering thing that once was Emma in some
far-off time before pain and horror conquered the
world&mdash;screamed as she stared down into the skeleton mask that
still was recognizable as Gram's face. Screamed again, and suddenly
was silent. She was lifted on a scarified knee and shuddering arms
whose hands rested on the frail brittle corpse of her grandmother
and she was silent while her own body chattered in the grip of a
gelid ague and the freezing shock cleared the fever-mists from her
brain.</p>

<p>As reason came back to her she saw that the vermilion-fretted
arch over her was a roof of foliage; that the black bastions were
the boles of trees, silhouetted against a sky lurid with reflected
flame; that Gram's cadaver, swathed in dark burial clothes, had
been decently laid out on a pile of dead leaves.</p>

<p>She shook her head, dragged thought away from the racking pain
that possessed her. However the old woman's body had gotten here,
it had been treated with a curious respect oddly at variance with
the ghoulishness of its being moved at all. This was a clearing in
the wood, an opening floored by a great rock that had given
sustenance to no seedling. Dimly she recalled it, knew she was not
far from the Sprool mansion. The glare in the sky was from the
conflagration that by now must have completely engulfed it. The
road was only fifty feet down this slope before her the old house
was to the right and the village to the left.</p>

<p>Curious&mdash;while the whole vault of the sky was aflame it
glowed more deeply, more virulently scarlet, to the left&mdash;in
the direction of Ekwanok&mdash;and not from the quarter where the
Sprool house was burning. Emma recalled the bonfire around which a
mad dance had circled. But that had been completely hidden by Big
Tom's shoulder&mdash;and now&mdash;</p>

<p>Dim, distant thrum of a speeding auto came to her ears, of
Kurt's car, running up the road. Then he had escaped from Milton,
was still hunting the Things. <i>The one that had taken her from
the flames would be coming back for her!</i> Fear's livid hand
squeezed her heart once more, and the ghastly need for hurry. She
must get away from here, get away! But where?</p>

<p>Down to the road. That was her only hope. Down to the roadside
to lie there and pray that Kurt would find her before the Thing
did. Pray! What good would it do to pray? God would not hear her.
Just lie there and&mdash;and hope&mdash;</p>

<p>By the time Emma reached the muddy ditch of the trail bisecting
the doomed Valley of Ekwanok, she had touched the limit of
endurance. The very limit. She lay in that ditch more dead than
alive, and gave herself over to the waves of unbearable pain that
were a moving tide in her twitching, shattered body.</p>

<p>Barely conscious, she lay, a blood-daubed, naked, shattered
shape in the muck of the ditch, and knew that the arching heavens
were aflame with lurid glow and the dark bulk of the mountains were
monstrous blots against that bloody sky. Their coil was very tight,
now, around the valley they had doomed, and the horror they had
spawned in the long, brooding years was rampant now in the
earth-fold between them.</p>

<p>A spark fluttered from the flames leaping, down there in the
valley. Some wanton breeze took it, lifted it high and higher. So
microscopic it was that the mountains did not notice it as it
soared. But Emma saw it attain the black veil with which Satan had
covered the valley, saw it burn a tiny hole in that veil, and go
out, its task accomplished.</p>

<p>Prayer needs, Emma thought&mdash;if the wee stirring in that dim
pulse to which her life had dwindled might be called
thought&mdash;only the tiniest possible opening to get through to
God. "Please, God," she prayed. "Help Milton and me. Please."</p>

<p>A smile brushed her poor, torn lips and, strangely enough, she
sighed as if in contentment. Darkness beat against her brain...</p>

<p>The murmur of Kurt Tradin's car was louder, nearer. He was
between her and the village, and was coming this way. Thus quickly
had her prayer been answered! He was coming, he was
coming&mdash;what was that curious growling mutter, behind the
crescendoing roar of his approach?</p>

<p>No matter. Kurt was coming to save her&mdash;No, he couldn't be.
He had last seen her in the blazing house, he must think her dead,
burned. He wouldn't be looking for her, wouldn't see her in the
ditch. She must get out in the road, where he couldn't miss
her.</p>

<p>He might not see her in time, might run her over? That wouldn't
be so bad. Milton was dead.</p>

<p>She should never had brought Milton here. The mountains had
nothing against him, they hated only her. Only the blood of the
Sprools.</p>

<p>Emma shut off thought that was madness, was scrabbling again,
waking pain again as she pulled herself out of the ditch, out into
the road. This was far enough, he would see her here. She couldn't
get any farther.</p>

<p>The ground was vibrating now to the pound of his wheels. He was
coming, coming fast. That strange mutter, like low thunder, was
slightly louder, almost indefinably so. What could it be?</p>

<p>Trees along the roadside lightened, their green virulent. Kurt's
headlight was doing that, his emerald headlight. He'd be here in
seconds now, in seconds. Agonizingly Emma struggled to prop herself
up on an elbow, so that he would surely see her.</p>

<p>It was like green sunlight now, the glare of his light. There
was a curve there, twenty feet down the road, and he was coming
head on toward those trees, while here Emma was still cloaked by
red-tinged darkness. "He'll have to slow down for the curve," she
mumbled. "And he'll be more likely to see me." Excitement shook
her. "He's slowing down now."</p>

<p>There was the hiss of skidding rubber, the squeal of tightening
brakes. The green light wavered, did not sweep along the trees, and
motor throb died away. God, oh God! he's stopping. He's
turning&mdash;he's going back! "Kurt! <i>Kurt!</i>" Her cry, the
scream she intended, was a rasping whisper. Her smoke-burned throat
could manage no better. She was crawling, crawling in a paroxysm of
terror lest he turn and leave her, dragging her injured leg after
her. Her tortured progress was infinitely slow, but the light held
steady. "KURT!"</p>

<p>Somehow she attained the bend in the road, whimpering, rounded
it. Emerald blaze swallowed her. The car was ahead, only steps
ahead. Emma fell flat, lifted the ton-weight of one arm, waved.
"Kurt."</p>

<p>There was no response from the stalled car. He didn't see her,
couldn't hear her. He would turn in a minute now and drive
away.</p>

<p>Something threshed on the hillside above her. Emma rolled over
to the sound. Something was prowling up there. Her scalp tightened,
grisly fingers stroked her spine. The Thing was hunting her!
No&mdash;it was hunting Kurt. She twisted back to stare at the grey
auto, to try to warn him somehow. Realized that the vehicle was
empty, that no one was behind its wheel&mdash;It must be Kurt on
the hillside. He was not about to turn back. He had stopped to hunt
the Thing on foot&mdash;perhaps had seen one. Of course he had, the
one that had carried her off, coming back for her.</p>

<p>Good Kurt. Brave Kurt. He had come to her rescue. But, funny,
but she was down here in the road, and he didn't know it. She was
down here and she couldn't let him know. If she could get to the
car and blow his horn he would know she was there and come down to
her.</p>

<p><i>If</i> she could&mdash;Emma was off once more on her <i>Via
Crucis,</i> her road of pain. Crawling through dust, scrambling
through mud. Hitching her flaming torment along on jerking elbows,
on plunging knee. Banging the torture of her broken leg against
stones. Till at last the hot smell of grease was in her nostrils,
the stench of burned gas, and she passed into the shadow of Kurt's
car, high above her.</p>

<p>Followed, then, the fight to get a hand up to the running board,
the struggle to lift the torso and rest her breasts on the metal
ledge. The dismay at the discovery that the door was closed. The
fear, the awful fear, that it was locked. The reaching of cramped,
aching fingers to the handle and the agonized instant before a
click told her that it was not.</p>

<p>The door swung open, thudding her to the ground. But it
<i>was</i> open. Men have climbed Jungrau, Mont Blanc. So, too, did
Emma Wayne climb into that auto. Then she lay gasping, quivering on
the smeared floorboards.</p>

<p>All she must do now was get up to the seat so that she might
reach the horn-button. She rolled, stretched an arm to the leathery
cushion.</p>

<p>And her hand touched clammy wetness, sank into the humid, doughy
staff of which the grey, grisly Things were formed!</p>

<p>Here, in this car, in Kurt's car, a Thing hulked on its seat, on
its driver's seat. It moved, dropped on her, enveloped her with its
shuddersome foulness.</p>

<p>All her fighting, all her terrific impossible struggle, had
availed only to bring her straight into the clutches of that which
she fled!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash;
MAD&mdash;MAD&mdash;MAD!</h2>

<p class="first">THE obscene, semi-solid mass enveloped her with
its clammy, chill foulness, folded about her like an ineffably
noisome coverlet. It clamped down on her&mdash;and gradually Emma
was aware that it was lax, queerly flaccid; that, holding her
captive, it was oddly lifeless, unmoving.</p>

<p>Nor, and this too was utterly strange, did it crush her with
ponderous bulk, as had the one Kurt had killed on the hillside
above the mansion. Somewhere the muted crow of a cock beat to her.
Was the Thing, then, indeed compounded of some effluvium of the
dreadful night? Was it losing its substance with approaching dawn?
Would it vanish entirely with the day?</p>

<p>Would it&mdash;an agonized cry sounded in Emma's buzzing ears,
the thud of hurrying footfalls. The car shook to the spring of
someone to its running-board, and the lewd blanket lifted from her.
"Emmy," Kurt Tradin lipped. "Sweetheart."</p>

<p>His face was contorted, his eyes black flame. One cheek was
pulped, and oozing droplets of gore. He was coatless and his shirt
half-torn from a shoulder, hanging in tatters, his arm a mass of
clotted blood, and from it the limp Thing dangled. His great biceps
crawled as he threw it aside&mdash;<i>threw it!</i> Incredibly the
grey mass flopped to the seat-back, hung like a cast-aside
garment.</p>

<p>Emma's glance stabbed to it, and suddenly she knew! Hysteric
laughter burbled in her throat, bubbled from between her torn lips.
Kurt's face blazed with a queer light, his arms stabbed to her. "At
last! At last, sweetheart, ye're like me. Come, darlin'. Come to
me."</p>

<p>Oh God! He was mad, stark mad! That which he had cast aside was
a coverall, hooded and plastered thick with putty! <i>He</i> was
the Thing, the grey and grisly Thing that prowled the night and
killed. He it was who had plunged through the flames and snatched
her from them. The thick wet putty of his grotesque masquerade had
protected him from their heat and warded the blaze from her.
He&mdash;His shaking arms slid under her, lifted her, pressed her
against his hairy, heaving chest. His thick hot lips slobbered
kisses on her face. She beat at him feebly&mdash;feebly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear," he was mumbling. "My dearest dear. Ye are like me, ye
are insane. I can see it in yer eyes. At last ye are insane and fit
to be my mate." His head went back, he was roaring with laughter,
laughter somehow frenzied, somehow mad as the mad night. "The old
fool said," he spluttered, "thet I was crazy and not for you. He
wuz right, but he ain't right no longer. I've made you crazy as
me." He crushed her against his sweaty breast. "Hey, Jeremiah," he
bellowed, and the weird echo of his shout echoed hollowly from the
everlasting hills. "Jeremiah Sprool! Look! She's mine now. She's
crazy and she's mine. Everybody's crazy, ye white-bearded fool,
everybody in th' valley. Look at them. Jeremiah Sprool. Damn you,"
his crazed shouting shrilled. "I'm not the only crazy one now!
Everybody's mad!"</p>

<p>"Mad," the fire-reddened slope of Big Tom caught the word and
flung it back at her. <i>"Mad,"</i> echo delayed came from the
hills across the valley. "MAD!" the crazed universe shouted at her.
And "mad" whispered the writhing worms in Emma's own skull. Of
course she was mad, and all the insane happenings of the night only
the ravings of her own delirium, of her own crazed brain that
shrieked the horror to her. Mad, <i>mad,</i> MAD.</p>

<p>It seemed to&mdash;or was it real?&mdash;that redder, more lurid
flame glared about her, that the far-off mutter had crescendoed to
a wild, imminent clamor. She felt Kurt tense, swing about. She
saw&mdash;or thought she saw&mdash;a horde of fiends, man-form and
horrible, flooding down the road toward them&mdash;brandishing
flaming torches that were chair-legs, and riven table-tops, and the
flaring palings of once neat fences. It seemed that Kurt snarled
bestially, that a fierce, animal howling came from the onrushing
pack as they caught sight of him.</p>

<p>Real! It couldn't be real, this outpouring of demons from a
living Hell! It couldn't be real&mdash;that Milton&mdash;her
Milton&mdash;loped ahead of the howling pack, an up-ended broom
flaunting fire like an orange banner above his head! It wasn't true
that Kurt was screaming obscene maledictions at the on-rushing,
monstrous throng and that they were responding with mewling
catcalls, with squeals like nothing ever heard on earth, with
maniacal howls. That she herself had joined the blasphemous choir
with thin sounds formed in her throat without mental command.</p>

<p>"Look," Kurt bellowed&mdash;or in her waking nightmare she heard
him bellow. "Look, Jeremiah! Look at them." His hollow, shouting
voice broke into ear-piercing, cackling laughter. "Look, Jeremiah
Sprool." And then suddenly he whirled to the roadside, plunged into
the brush carrying her.</p>

<p>"Emma!" the apparition that was like Milton screamed, "I'm
coming. Hold him&mdash;I'm coming."</p>

<p>"Mil&mdash;" Kurt's stinking hand clamped over her mouth. She
fanged it, tasted salt taste of his blood, but it tightened,
stifling her answer. She writhed&mdash;agony darted through her,
numbing.</p>

<p>"Hush," Kurt mumbled. "Hush darling. We've mustn't let them
catch us. They'll spoil everything. Jeremiah sent them after us,
and if they catch us they'll tear us apart. Hush."</p>

<p>Close-growing trees closed about them, bushes lashed at them.
Red shadows danced through thick foliage, and the rush of the
following horde was like thunder in the transmogrified forest. Kurt
loped through the woods like a thing possessed, clutching Emma to
his heaving breast, and the pursuers gibbered and howled behind
them. The jungle-horde bayed down the wind after the fleeing man
and his captive, and he was silent now as the grave, slipping
through vermilion-flickering, arboreal aisles whose flanking trees
tossed black branches to a lurid sky.</p>

<p>"Emma!" Milton howled. "Emma, where are you?"</p>

<p>The girl jerked her head, pain seared her neck-muscles. Kurt's
palm slipped momentarily from her lips and she screamed, "Here,
Mil&mdash;" Her captor snarled as he shut-off her scream, twisted
to a new direction in his mad flight.</p>

<p>"Hush, darling," he muttered. "Hush." His snicker rippled her
spine with loathing. "Yer Milton is dead. That isn't yer Milton but
a devil in his body. I know! I killed yer Milton and put him in his
coffin."</p>

<p>Oh God! Oh merciless God! Milton was dead and she a captive of
his slayer. Feebly Emma squirmed, reckless of torture, and beat
weakly at his breast that was steel-armored with muscle. "Let me
down, you fiend. Let me down."</p>

<p>Tradin's tireless stride ploughed through undergrowth on which
torchlight danced now more dimly. "Soon dear," he gibbered. "Soon.
I've got a bed prepared for us. A nice bed of leaves in th' woods,
an' Elmer's akeepin' it warm fer us. Elmer..." Suddenly his voice
broke into a heart-rending sob, he shook her in his great arms,
savagely. "You made me kill him. You made me kill Elmer. Ef I
didn't love ye so much..."</p>

<p>"Ohhh, don't! Who... who is Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Huh!" The madman's twisted, grotesque head threw back, and
peals of shrill, maniacal laughter shuddered through the red-edged
trees. "Do ye hear, Jeremiah? She doesn't know about Elmer. She
never knew about him. But ye did. Ye knew about my poor, crazy
brother locked in my house. Hidden thar. But did ye see him
tonight? Did ye see how he helped me make her mad? Did ye see how
he killed her horse? An' all week, did ye see how he prowled the
woods dressed in th' putty suit I made fer him an' scared whut
brains they had out o' them others in the village, whilst I
pertended ter hunt him an' we waited fer her ter come? Ye said I
was like him, Jeremiah Sprool! Well, I am like him, an' so is she.
So is yer granddaughter, Jeremiah, like him an' like me. Crazy.
Ravin' crazy. A Sprool fit at last ter be th' mad Tradin's
bride!"</p>

<p>The whole, horrible affair was clear now to Emma's tortured
brain. Love for her had made Kurt mad. Love for her and Granddad's
gibe. Tortured by knowledge of the maniac concealed in his home,
the man had brooded till his mind had snapped when Gram had died.
That was why he had written her, why he had dug up Faith Sprool and
returned her coffin to the old parlor, why he had costumed his mad
brother as foulness incarnate and set him on to harry her. <i>To
drive her crazy, too, so that he might mate with her.</i></p>

<p>And then he had learned that she already was married, had set
out to intercept Milton on the highway, to kill him there. She had
spoiled that scheme, but he had returned to the Sprool house
and&mdash;Oh God!&mdash;had succeeded! "I killed him. I killed yer
Milton," the doomful words rang in her ears.</p>

<p>Mad and a killer! From his own mouth had come the confession.
And she was to be his bride! Wild laughter clawed in turn at Emma's
throat. "Milton," she groaned. "Dead or alive, Milton. Save
me."</p>

<p>The sound of the pursuers was a far-off murmur in the darkening
forest. Kurt chuckled, started to circle. "They can't find us now,
my love. They'll never find us now."</p>

<p>This wasn't happening. Reason fled from her and she was again
the whimpering, terrified toy of a grisly nightmare. God wouldn't
let it happen. Oh please, God. I'm crazy. Please let me be crazy
and just imagining this...</p>

<p>"Drop her, you dog!" A dark figure suddenly loomed out of the
forest. "Drop her!"</p>

<p>Milton! It was Milton, or the demon in his body! A gleam from
somewhere showed Emma the pallid oval of his face, his scarred
mouth twisted in wrath, his virulent eyes.</p>

<p>Tradin growled, jerked aside, dodging Milton's impetuous rush,
his flailing fist. Stumbled and fell to his knees, and Emma crashed
from his arms to the ground as Kurt leaped to his feet. Agony
twisted the girl's throat to a scream of pain and horror as the two
figures were motionless for a long minute, crouching and splotched
with alternated black and lurid red till all resemblance to
anything human was gone. "Yer dead," Tradin yammered. "Yer
dead!"</p>

<p>"Got you!" Milt's voice was a growl, an animal rumble. "Got you
at last. Are you going to take it from me or from your neighbors,
Tradin? They know now what you are. They saw the grey Thing in your
car when I yelled, and they're after you. They're hunting you down,
<i>killer!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ye'd never have cotched me, ye ner th' rest o' yer pack, ef'n I
hadn't stopped fer my wife."</p>

<p><i>"Your</i> wife!" Milton leaped, and Tradin lunged to meet
him. The two phantasms closed in snarling, yapping, grunting
combat. Emma heard the smack of a fist, saw a hooked thumb gouging
an eye. The black whirlwind of battle was suddenly detailless in
its hideous, dark swirling as vertigo seized her brain, and nausea
retched at her stomach.</p>

<p>Someone screamed. A scream shrilled from the maelstrom pregnant
with unutterable pain. The whirling mass split and one of the
combatants sprawled headlong. It writhed, screaming, on the ground.
Milton! Oh God! It was Milton. Kurt leaped to the kill. His shod
foot lifted to grind down on Milton's contorted face.</p>

<p>Emma flung out a frantic hand, gripped an ankle, jerked. Tradin,
off-balance, staggered. Milton rolled, threw a hand upward, seized
a low branch and pulled himself erect. Hung to the bough, reeling
and helpless, as the madman heeled Emma's side and jerked away,
crouching to leap again&mdash;snarling.</p>

<p>Lurid light burst through screening tree trunks and the as yet
distant howls of the gibbering pack surged nearer. Tradin froze.
His lean visage turned to the sound. Fear flared into his reddened
eyes. Again he snarled, lipping his teeth; whirled; and was gone in
the shadows.</p>

<p>The instant's respite straightened Milton. He shouted something,
plunged after the escaping madman. Their flight and pursuit
threshed through the woods, the tumult dying.</p>

<p>The ground heaved under Emma and she was sliding down a long
black <i>glissade</i> into billowing murk like storm clouds at the
bottom of an abyss. A screech of awful agony, distant but undulled,
held her for an instant, then the rolling clouds took her.</p>

<p>For a timeless period she was free from pain. But even as she
floated in the heart of that dark, warm blackness grief was a
leaden lump in her bosom, and green-glowing worms crawled in her
racked and aching brain.</p>

<p>Something was pulling her out of the cloud. A voice. A choked
and inarticulate voice. Someone's arms were around her and her
tortured head was pillowed on someone's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart."</p>

<p>Terror gripped her again, and she cried out. "Let me go," she
sobbed. "Let me go Kurt," and nailed at hard flesh with futile
hands, like fluttering wings of a wounded bird, while her eyelids
squeezed tight against the madness twisted features she dreaded to
see.</p>

<p>"Easy, Emma. Easy does it." Gentle hands held her wrists. "It's
Milton, darling. Milton."</p>

<p>It was Milton! She sobbed against her lips, and his dear arms
stilled the shuddering of her torn and twisted body. "You're hurt,
Em-girl, you're terribly hurt."</p>

<p>"Yes. But&mdash;Oh Milton, are you alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm alive. I must have a thick head. He sloughed me hard
enough to break it in that old parlor where he lay for me. But I
only passed out. But I had a damn bad moment when I woke up in that
coffin, and hearing him make love to you didn't help my feelings
any. Guess I went nuts&mdash;I thought&mdash;Hell&mdash;Your trying
to keep me out of that room, even when we heard someone moving
around in there, made me think that you knew he was there, that you
were going to sneak in there to meet him when you got a
chance."</p>

<p>"Was that why you looked at me like that, with hate in your
eyes? Oh Milt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was why. I'm a dog, dear. Forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Milt&mdash;He got away?"</p>

<p>"No." There was grimness in her husband's voice. "No. He didn't
get away. He's&mdash;" His head pulled around and he was staring
into the darkness whence he had come as a far-off howling made the
night hideous. "God! The villagers must have found him and..."</p>

<p>A last poignant shudder shook Emma as the distant ululation rose
to a wild, horrible chorus. Milton's arms constricted more tightly
about her. "My poor dear. My poor, poor girl."</p>

<p>"Milt," she managed to say. "Take me away from here. Your car is
up on the hill. Carry me to it and take me as far away from here as
you can."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">DAWN found them on Big Tom Highway, Milton's car
eating the miles away from horror and the valley where madmen still
roamed and red fire still raged. "Milt," Emma sighed. "What's to
become of us? We haven't a cent. How are we going to live?"</p>

<p>A smile broke the grimness of Milton's face. "We'll live, dear.
I have a job. Johnson liked the way I straightened out his mess so
well that he's put me in charge of his accounting department. Fifty
a week, dear, and a chance to buy stock in the concern. I was
coming only to take you back to New York."</p>

<p>Ahead, a finger of the sun broke through the gloomy trees, and
the couple drove into its roseate glow that somehow bathed them, as
they chugged through it, with a benediction and a promise.</p>
