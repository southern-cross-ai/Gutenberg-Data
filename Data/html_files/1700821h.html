<h2>ABOUT THIS BOOK</h2>

<p class="first">EIGHT persons are assembled in the dining-room
of the palatial home of Sir Rupert Haffervale, business magnate
of Sydney. Five of them are his associates, prominent men in the
life of the city. The sixth is the star reporter of a big daily.
The occasion is the formal handing over of control of a huge
trust to Sir Rupert's niece and heiress on her coming of age.</p>

<p>At noon, as the knight is about to conduct his niece to the
head of the table he falls forward with a bullet through his
heart.</p>

<p>The fatal shot was undoubtedly fired by someone in the room,
yet no report was heard. Who was the murderer?</p>

<p>With this dramatic scene Aidan de Brune, famous Australian
author, opens his latest mystery, "The Murders at Madlands," the
serial rights of which have been secured by the "Express."</p>

<p>"The Dagger and the Cord," "The Green Pearl," "The Unlawful
Adventure" and other thrilling tales of mystery and intrigue have
made Mr. de Brune popular with Australian fiction readers, and
"The Murders at Madlands" enhances his reputation.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">"'LO, Bobby. Got everything you want?"</p>

<p>Bobby Trayne looked up with a start. Although every sense had
been on the alert from the moment he had entered the room, the
question had caught his attention wandering. He nodded vaguely to
the small table, set close beside his solitary chair.</p>

<p>"Smokes, drinks of all patterns&mdash;all that the soul of a
journalist covets, except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" Gerald Preston, private secretary to Sir Rupert
Haffervale, spoke almost impatiently. He glanced nervously
towards the dark, grim-visaged man seated at the far end of the
long dining table. "Anything I can get you?"</p>

<p>"No one better!" Bobby spoke very quickly. "To make the
surroundings perfect I want just one thing&mdash;Why am I
here?"</p>

<p>"You don't know?" Almost involuntarily the man glanced again
at his employer.</p>

<p>"I don't." Very deliberately Bobby squirted from the siphon
half a glass of soda water and sipped it slowly "I know I was
telephoned by the office to come in this morning. When I arrived
I found Alan Reeves, the respected chief of staff of the
<i>Daily Mirror</i>, already at his desk. That alone was a
suspicious circumstance."</p>

<p>"How?" Although Preston spoke eagerly he still stared up the
room to where his employer sat.</p>

<p>"Merely that to get Alan Reeves out of bed before mid-day is,
or should be, recorded as one of the seven wonders of the world.
Yet he was there, bright and worried, at nine-fifteen, Ack
Emma."</p>

<p>"Well?" Some signal, imperceptible to the onlooker, must have
passed between Sir Rupert and his secretary, for the latter
turned and pulled a chair close to Bobby's side, sitting with his
back half-turned to the group at the other end of the long
room.</p>

<p>"Well?" Bobby echoed the word with exasperating slowness.</p>

<p>"You were telling me what took place between yourself and Mr.
Reeves." Rupert Preston lifted one of the decanters and poured a
liberal allowance of whisky into a glass.</p>

<p>"Very little took place." A wide, boyish grin came on the
newspaperman's lips. "Alan Reeves instructed me to go down into
the street at ten-thirty. There I should find a private car,
driven by a chauffeur in Sir Rupert Haffervale's livery. I was to
enter that car&mdash;and not ask questions."</p>

<p>"Yet you are asking them?" Preston shrugged his narrow
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I took the prohibition to apply to the chauffeur."</p>

<p>For some moments there was silence. Once Preston half-turned
and glanced up the room, but Bobby sat silent, and almost
motionless. His keen brain was probing possibilities. He knew he
was being used as a pawn in some secret game. But, what was that
game? The experience was original and not altogether to his
liking.</p>

<p>"Newspapermen are sent out by their employers on all kinds of
assignments." Preston spoke slowly. "To report&mdash;or
discover."</p>

<p>Bobby lifted a cigarette from the open box on the table and
lit it.</p>

<p>"I am not to write a line on what I see, hear&mdash;or
discover."</p>

<p>"Is that unusual?"</p>

<p>"For me." There was no conceit in the journalist's tones. "I
believe any Australian newspaper is anxious to publish anything I
write."</p>

<p>Again a long silence. Suddenly Gerald Preston raised his glass
to his lips and gulped the contents at a draught.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert encourages that?" Bobby drawled the words,
lazily.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"His secretary drinking raw whisky by the half-glass." The
newspaper man tensed, "Come, Gerald, what's the story."</p>

<p>"You talk like a policeman." A slight frown puckered the light
brows.</p>

<p>"Seems like I'm doing policeman's duty." Bobby lowered his
voice, speaking rapidly. "Listen! I get in the car, quite a
luxurious affair, and it drives away. We go through Bondi and out
into the open country. A couple of miles and the road curves in
towards Barrabarra Bay. I'm deposited, gently, on the doorstep of
one of the oldest houses in the State&mdash;a house dating back
to the first days of the Colony of New South Wales."</p>

<p>"One of Sir Rupert Haffervale's residences." Preston
smiled.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"You're picking points." The secretary spoke angrily.
"Nominally the house belongs to Sir Rupert. Of course if you want
to be absolutely exact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The House belongs to Sir Rupert's niece, Miss Myrtle
Haffervale. I am only guessing but I believe that Miss Haffervale
comes of age today."</p>

<p>Gerald Preston nodded, shortly. The frown on his face had
deepened.</p>

<p>"And I am asked to witness the handing over of the young
lady's fortune." Bobby's tone was bland.</p>

<p>"Not exactly." The secretary laughed, irritatedly. "You are
correct in assuming that Miss Haffervale comes of age today, and
gains control of the income of her fortune. But the
principal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remains under the control of her trustees until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until she marries or attains the age of thirty." Preston
supplied the information reluctantly. "You understand, Bobby,
this is not for publication. Sir Rupert will give the
<i>Mirror</i> what it is to publish."</p>

<p>"While the <i>Mirror</i>'s star man sits and drinks
his&mdash;or Miss Haffervale's&mdash;whisky&mdash;The ethics of
journalism are fully served!"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert controls the <i>Mirror</i>," The secretary
answered quickly.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert controls&mdash;but Miss Haffervale holds!" The
newspaper-man laughed gently. "If the Registrar General is
correctly informed the late Matthew Haffervale owned three shares
in the newspaper to Sir Rupert's one."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert is managing director of the Company."</p>

<p>"By the grace of Matthew Haffervale&mdash;and his will." Bobby
paused. "So you, see nothing strange in the <i>Mirror</i>'s star
reporter being called in from his just and due rest to attend the
handling over to Miss Haffervale of the income from her
fortune&mdash;while instructed not to write a line on the subject
for publication?</p>

<p>"Then let me continue my theories." The journalist was
enjoying himself. "On arrival at Madlands&mdash;by the way the
name of the house quite fits my story&mdash;I was welcomed by Sir
Rupert and his niece. I was escorted to the grand old dining-room
and given a seat opposite the long windows opening on to the
balcony. My chair was placed so that, while I commanded the
windows and balcony, I had one of the doors close to my hand and
the other wall well within sight. I was instructed not to let
anyone in at the door, and to raise an alarm if I saw anyone, or
anything suspicious on the balcony. And you wonder when I say I
have fallen to a John's job."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert might not have cared to call the police."</p>

<p>"So he uses a man to whom the <i>Mirror</i> pays two thousand
a year, when he could have obtained the eyes of a second-year
cadet! Rather expensive, isn't that?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert may have reasons."</p>

<p>"To explain them, let me continue." Bobby spoke imperturbably.
"I should have said Sir Rupert, himself, brought me to this seat
before he left me; he placed in my hands, this:"</p>

<p>With a quick motion Bobby produced a small but serviceable
automatic, and dropped it on the table, yet keeping his hand in
close proximity to it.</p>

<p>"Just the handing over of a wealthy young lady's income!" the
journalist jeered. "It can't be otherwise or&mdash;" he glanced
significantly at the group at the end of the long table.</p>

<p>"You know them?"</p>

<p>Preston shifted his chair so that he could watch up the room
towards his employer.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Sir Rupert is seated at the head of the table. On
his right is Miss Myrtle Haffervale. Next to her is an empty
seat&mdash;occupied by you, until you took pity on my loneliness
and came to interest and instruct me. Next to that chair sits
Adam Ibbotson, controlling, I believe, not only newspaper but
tobacco interests. On Sir Rupert's left is Mark Parsons, senior
partner in Parsons, Parsons, Myers and Parsons, solicitors to Sir
Rupert Haffervale, the late Matthew Haffervale, Miss Myrtle
Haffervale, and the <i>Daily Mirror</i> Newspaper Publishing
Company, Limited. Next to him is Fred Frazer, Mr. Parsons'
managing clerk&mdash;really he knows more about the family and
the newspaper than his chief, but of course has not the standing
to guide so important a gathering of notabilities. Next to Mr.
Frazer is Godfrey Mackenzie, chain store controller, and nearest
us is Lord Carriday. I believe his holdings form quite a kingdom
in the north lands of Australia. What they are in South America
no one but himself and his personal accountant has yet
fathomed."</p>

<p>"You seem to have it all, pal."</p>

<p>Again Gerald flashed a quick glance up the table&mdash;as if
asking for instruction or aid. "What of it? It seems you are
making a mountain out of a molehill."</p>

<p>"Nothing! Just nothing, Gerald, dear!" Bobby rose to his feet,
and stretched himself. "I see our friends have finished. So my
newest and most novel assignment is drawing to a close. Never
again will I accuse the new South Wales Police Department of
incompetence, if much of their duty approximates this they must
sleep serene lives. A word with Sir Rupert and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Preston jumped from his chair, involuntarily following
the journalist's lead. He glanced quickly towards the group at
the end of the long table.</p>

<p>Sir Rupert had risen to his feet and, standing with his
knuckles resting on the table-top, was addressing the girl,
half-humorously, half-formally. As he concluded his little speech
with a bow, the girl, smilingly, pushed back her chair and made
to rise.</p>

<p>A sudden shout from the newspaperman drew all eyes to him.
With a sweep of his arm he thrust Preston from his path, throwing
him onto the small table, which collapsed under the sudden
burden. In a couple of bounds he was at the girl's side, kneeling
beside her chair and holding her down with an iron grip.</p>

<p>"Look out, Sir Rupert, jump!"</p>

<p>The sudden cry brought the other men to their feet.</p>

<p>For the space in which a man could count five, Sir Rupert
stood at the head of the table, a strange look of wonder on his
face. Slowly he leaned forward, bowing until his forehead rested
on the polished surface of the table. A shudder shook his frame
and he collapsed, a mass of quivering flesh and clothes.</p>

<p>"Hands up, everyone."</p>

<p>Bobby had caught up the girl and backed into the corner beside
the windows. "Hands up, I say. The man who moves, I'll
shoot."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a long minute there was silence in the room.
Bobby hooked a chair towards him and pushed it into the corner.
He placed the girl in the chair and turned again to face the men
around the table.</p>

<p>Mark Parsons was on his feet, bending over Sir Rupert's
motionless body. The journalist watched him sombrely. As the
lawyer straightened himself the automatic swung to cover him.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert&mdash;" Mark Parsons hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes." Bobby paused, then continued quickly. "Only wounded!
Good! Gerald, telephone for the doctor! At the same time you
might ring up the police. No, not Bondi. Get on to Headquarters
and ask for Inspector Williams. I know he's there this
morn&mdash;Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To the telephone," the secretary answered, sullenly. "There
is not one in this room."</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid I cannot use your services."</p>

<p>For the moment Bobby was puzzled. He glanced towards the
solicitor who still remained on his feet.</p>

<p>"May I trouble you to touch the bell, Mr. Parsons. A servant
can do all I require."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Mark Parsons turned irritatedly on the journalist.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only wounded&mdash;I believe a slight wound." The
newspaperman interrupted quickly. His voice dropped and became
pregnant with meaning. "Nothing can be
done&mdash;immediately&mdash;for him."</p>

<p>"Nothing." Mr. Parsons spoke after a long pause.
"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Preston will help you move Sir Rupert to the couch."</p>

<p>Again Bobby interrupted the lawyer. "Then he will return to
the seat he occupied when he entertained me. You,
gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" Adam Ibbotson sprang to his
feet, his ruddy face blazing with passion. "Who the hell are you
and what are you giving orders for. If anything's happened to Sir
Rupert then Mr. Parsons, as his solicitor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons abdicates in my favour." A slight grin broke the
stern lines of the newspaper's man's mouth. "For the time I am in
control. If you question my authority ask this." The automatic
swung in an arc to cover the financier.</p>

<p>Ibbotson made as if to speak, then slumped angrily into his
chair.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" Godfrey Mackenzie turned a thin,
ascetic face towards the corner where the journalist stood before
the girl. "You say Sir Rupert is only wounded&mdash;and you are
the only armed man in the room."</p>

<p>"So far as we know at present," Bobby nodded.</p>

<p>"I suggest that Miss Haffervale be allowed to go to her room,"
Lord Carriday interposed.</p>

<p>"Sorry to negative that!" The journalist spoke quickly. "Sir
Rupert, for a reason of his own, brought me here this
morning&mdash;a kind of super-policeman, so far as I gather. I
propose to remain the policeman until the official men arrive.
Ah!"</p>

<p>A slight, discreet knock at the door and a servant entered. He
started back with low cry at the sight of Sir Rupert stretched on
the couch, the solicitor and secretary bending over him.</p>

<p>"Thomas, Charles&mdash;whatever your name is," Bobby spoke
imperatively. "Listen to me. Go to the telephone and ring up the
nearest doctor. Ask him to come here with all speed; then get on
to Police Headquarters, Phillip Street, City, and ask for
Inspector Williams. Tell him I&mdash;Bobby Trayne&mdash;want him
at Madlands, as quickly as possible. Understand? He's to put the
Blue Bird at her top and get here. Now, get to it!"</p>

<p>"The local police station should be informed." The solicitor
spoke over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams can do that."</p>

<p>"Then you propose we should remain here until a policeman
comes out from the city," Lord Carriday drawled, ironically.</p>

<p>"Just that!" There was a tang of decision in the
newspaperman's voice. The Englishman, with his drawling speech
irritated him greatly. "And Sir Rupert is to be unattended until
the Inspector arrives."</p>

<p>"You're taking a lot on yourself, young man." Adam Ibbotson
sneered. "I'll have a word to say to your employers."</p>

<p>"A doctor will be here within a few minutes."</p>

<p>Without releasing his grasp on his gun Bobby pulled a case
from his pocket and took out a cigarette. Using only one hand he
struck a match and drew the smoke into his lungs with very
apparent satisfaction.</p>

<p>"And I suppose the doctor will not be allowed to leave the
room once he enters," Ibbotson spoke with heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Correct."</p>

<p>"That's the sack for one cocky youngster." The financier
slumped into his chair. "What the devil Haffervale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you." Bobby hesitated and glanced back at the girl,
"Sorry to keep you there, Miss Haffervale, but its a case of
necessity. In that corner you're safe. Out in the
room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Safe? With an armed maniac standing before her." The
Englishman sprang to his feet and turned to the other men around
the table. "Are five strong men to be intimidated
by&mdash;by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're intimidated by this." The gun lined straight against
the peer. "Adam Ibbotson may talk but he knows me, Carriday. And
I may not be the only man armed in this room."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was shot. The gun that fired the bullet was
covered with a silencer." Bobby spoke slowly. "And&mdash;the
doors were shut and the windows closed and barred."</p>

<p>"You seem to know all about it." The Englishman turned from
his chair and strode across the room. "Shoot if you dare. I don't
intend to be held up by any servant."</p>

<p>"I shall shoot&mdash;and shoot to disable&mdash;if you
approach this corner of the room or go near doors or windows."
Bobby spoke earnestly. "You say I seem to know all about it.
Perhaps I know more than when I entered this room, half an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"You're insinuating?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." A light flashed in the newspaper-man's eyes. "For
the time I'm guessing&mdash;on the principle of putting two and
two together and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Making five of it." Carriday turned angrily. "It anything has
happened to Sir Rupert, Mr. Parsons is the logical&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet Sir Rupert sent for me." Again Bobby's infectious grin
showed. "Why did he do that? I wonder&mdash;but I don't know. Sir
Rupert expected something to happen. I didn't. I couldn't see how
anything criminal could happen with eight reputable people in a
closed room. Yet it has. If anything serious has happened to Sir
Rupert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trayne, is Sir Rupert seriously injured?" The girl spoke
from behind him; her tones anxious. "Will you not allow me to go
to him?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Miss Haffervale." Bobby thought a moment, then glanced
at his watch. "If Lord Carriday will resume his seat at the table
and the other gentleman give me their word not to move until
Inspector Williams arrives, you may go to Sir Rupert. Yes? That
doesn't apply to you Mr. Parsons. You and Miss Haffervale can do
all that's necessary at the moment, for Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>He stepped before the windows, until he came to the wall
immediately behind Sir Rupert's chair, at the head of the table.
The girl crossed quickly to the couch and whispered to the
solicitor. At his reply she dropped to her knees, covering her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>Bobby lowered his pistol hand. For some seconds his eyes
wandered from face to face of the sullen-looking men gathered
round the table. Presently he stepped forward and glanced down at
the polished table-top immediately before where Sir Rupert had
been seated.</p>

<p>A gold hunter-cased watch lay on the table&mdash;the cover
open. With a pencil Bobby carefully lowered the cover. On the
outer face was engraved Sir Rupert's monogram. The newspaperman
frowned, thoughtfully. Why had the wounded man had his opened
watch on the table? He let the cover fly open again. Immediately
he saw the hands he glanced down at his own watch. Sir Rupert's
watch was four minutes slow.</p>

<p>Sir Rupert had been interested in watching the time while he
sat at the table. Yet his watch was four minutes slow. Why?</p>

<p>Bobby half-stretched his hand out towards, the
watch&mdash;then drew it back. He must not touch anything! He
must preserve everything as it was at the moment the shot was
fired, until the arrival of the police.</p>

<p>A knock came at the door and Gerald Preston started to his
feet, to resume his seat at a slight motion from, the
newspaperman. Bobby gave the permission to enter and the servant
who had gone to the telephone opened the door.</p>

<p>"I have telephoned the doctor, sir," the man reported. "He
says he will be here in five minutes. I also telephoned the
police."</p>

<p>"Headquarters, as I Instructed?" Bobby spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams answer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He says he will be with you as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>"Good. You can go. Close the door after you."</p>

<p>"This is insufferable." Lord Carriday was again on his
feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down!"</p>

<p>"Held up by a young maniac armed with a gun," Ibbotson laughed
angrily. "But I'll see he gets his!"</p>

<p>Bobby, did not answer. His eyes were flashing from face to
face around the long table; his mind was conning over a problem.
Sir Rupert had his watch open on the desk&mdash;and that watch
was four minutes slow. Why? If only he could get an answer to
that question.</p>

<p>He turned to see the solicitor lifting Myrtle to her feet.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert&mdash;?" Bobby spoke questioningly to the
solicitor.</p>

<p>"Is dead." Parsons bowed his head. "I believe he died
instantaneously."</p>

<p>"I thought so." Bobby murmured. He raised his voice
slightly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons, will you please place a chair for Miss
Haffervale behind your chair at the table."</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale should&mdash;" The lawyer hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Not that!" The girl spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"The chair is the safest place." The newspaperman
insisted.</p>

<p>"Safest place, rot!" Ibbotson spoke. "Do you expect someone to
murder her."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell me who killed Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>Bobby's blue eyes flashed to the speaker.</p>

<p>"You suggest one of us murdered Sir Rupert," Carriday laughed,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you arrest him?"</p>

<p>"I'm arresting the lot of you&mdash;until the police come.
Then I shall do my best to help them to sort the murderer
out."</p>

<p>"Unmitigated rot!" Mackenzie swung his chair from the table,
leaning back, his elbows resting on the arms of the chair, his
fingertips meeting. "You dare to say that one of us murdered our
host."</p>

<p>"The doors were closed&mdash;no one opened them, I'll swear to
that. No one could get into the room from the terrace for the
windows were closed and locked. You can see the glass is
unbroken. How then could the shot come from without the
room&mdash;or how could any one enter the room to fire at Sir
Rupert? The only possible solution is that the shot was fired by
someone within the room. I am the only one who has shown a
weapon, yet. The police will decide if anyone else carries a
gun."</p>

<p>A knock sounded at the door. At the newspaperman's answer the
door opened and a short black-bearded man strode into the
room.</p>

<p>"Dr. Martingale, sir," the servant announced.</p>

<p>"All right. Mr. Parsons, will you attend Mr. Martingale?"</p>

<p>Bobby turned again to the servant who still stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"There is a policeman at the door, sir."</p>

<p>"A policeman? Inspector Williams?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. A constable from the local station."</p>

<p>"Show him in." Lord Carriday spoke impatiently. "Thank
goodness there's someone with authority come. Now we'll get rid
of this bumptious newspaperman."</p>

<p>"Hold on there." Bobby spoke quickly as the servant turned to
leave the room. "What's he want?"</p>

<p>"He says Sir Rupert rang up the local station early this
morning and asked that a constable should be sent here at noon
exactly. He says he is sorry he's a few minutes late. Shall I
show him in, sir?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">SIR RUPERT HAFFERVALE had asked the local police
station to send a constable to Madlands at noon that day!</p>

<p>Bobby glanced down at his watch. It was fifteen minutes past
the hour. So far as he could judge, Sir Rupert had been shot
exactly on the hour. Had the expected arrival of the constable
been the cause of Sir Rupert's open watch on the table. But that
watch was four minutes slow! Had the newspaper magnate known
that? It was improbable. The shooting of a man in a closed room
while he was surrounded by people of unimpeachable standing; the
slow watch, ticking on the table; the constable awaiting
admission at the door. They were all parts of a problem&mdash;a
problem at the solution of which the newspaperman could not yet
oven guess.</p>

<p>"Show in the constable." Bobby spoke decidedly. He turned to
the peer pacing agitatedly up and down the room. "I must ask you
to resume your seat, Lord Carriday."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse to take orders from you?" The cattle king
turned suddenly. "Remember, there's a constable at the door and
most likely armed. He'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call the bluff of this upstart journalist," Adam Ibbotson
interjected. "Once I'm out of this room I'll see to him."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Bobby drawled, "'fraid there's quite an eye-opener
coming to the Englishman. He'll be sorry he spoke."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Carriday strode up the room, to halt
before the newspaperman's levelled gun.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a hint, Carriday." There was an ominous
calmness in Bobby's voice. "I only had a glance at the wound in
Sir Rupert's breast. From the direction the bullet appears to
have taken, it must have been fired from somewhere near where you
were seated."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite finished?" Bobby laughed. He called permission for the
servant to enter.</p>

<p>The door swung open and a uniformed constable strode into the
room. A couple of paces and he halted, staring at the men in the
room, in amazement.</p>

<p>"One moment." The newspaperman spoke as the servant made to
return and shut the door.</p>

<p>"You, Thomas. Wait at the hall-door until Inspector Williams
arrives and bring him straight here. Understand? The Inspector is
to be brought to this room directly he steps from his car. When
you have shown him in you are to remain in the room until you
have permission to leave."</p>

<p>"Constable, arrest that man!" Lord Carriday turned and pointed
dramatically at Bobby. "He shot Sir Rupert Haffervale and has
held us up at the point of his gun. Heaven knows what would have
happened if you hadn't arrived!"</p>

<p>"Murder?" The constable strode over to the couch and looked
down on the still form of the newspaper proprietor. He looked up,
sharply, at Bobby standing behind the head of the table, the
automatic dangling in his fingers. "Put that gun down!"</p>

<p>"Try again, Sergeant." The journalist laughed slightly. "No,
only constable, I believe. You heard what I said to the servant?
Stop that. Pull your revolver and I'll plug you."</p>

<p>The man hesitated, his hand fumbling at his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"Get him, constable!" Lord Carriday took a couple of steps
towards the newspaperman. "If he fires I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Duck under the table." Bobby laughed. "Listen to sense and
not the ravings of a lunatic, constable. Sir Rupert sent for me
this morning to guard him from some unnamed danger. He, these
gentlemen, and this excitable British peer, were in this room
with Miss Haffervale, discussing business. The doors and windows
were closed and barred, yet someone shot Sir Rupert, I believe as
he was about to make an important statement. I've held everyone
up, keeping the room in the exact state in which it was at the
time of Sir Rupert's murder. I've sent for Inspector Williams. He
should be here within the next five minutes. Until he comes I
don't intend anything in the room to be touched&mdash;not even by
you."</p>

<p>"Sounds, reasonable." The constable scratched his head. He
turned to Lord Carriday. "What's this you say about this
gentleman shooting Sir Rupert Haffervale."</p>

<p>"He's the only one armed in the room." Carriday turned
furiously on the constable. "Are you going to do your duty and
arrest him?"</p>

<p>"Did you see him fire the shot?"</p>

<p>"No. But he was sitting in a position where he could have done
so without my knowledge. He&mdash;he has the dashed impertinence
to accuse me of the murder."</p>

<p>"Let me introduce Lord Carriday," the newspaperman spoke
easily. "Lord Carriday is quite an important person in his own
country. I'm going to ask him to resume his seat so that he does
not mess up any clues that might be about. Since the shooting he
has developed quite a partiality for walking. In fact so
energetic has he become that just before your arrived I had
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He threatened do shoot me."</p>

<p>"That's serious, sir." The constable turned to Bobby, a
worried look on his face. "We can't have that sort of thing, y'
know."</p>

<p>"Now constable, I suggest you take a chair over by that
door&mdash;the one you entered by&mdash;and watch. Between the
two of us we may persuade these gentlemen to be reasonably quiet
until Inspector Williams arrives."</p>

<p>The constable moved as if to obey; then turned to face the
newspaperman again.</p>

<p>"Who may you be?" he asked suddenly. "This gentleman&mdash;you
say he's Lord Carriday&mdash;accuses you of shooting Sir Rupert.
Sir Rupert rang up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Telephoned your police station and asked for you to be sent
here," Bobby interrupted. "Quite so. He also instructed my Chief
of Staff to send me here. My name is Robert Trayne&mdash;usually
called 'Bobby,' even at Police Headquarters. You needn't worry
about Lord Carriday's outburst. No one will support his
accusation."</p>

<p>"I will." Adam Ibbotson sprang to his feet. "I believe he's
right. You're the only one in the room who could have shot Sir
Rupert."</p>

<p>"Believe!" Bobby laughed. "The accusation is ridiculous."</p>

<p>Myrtle spoke slowly. "Mr. Trayne has only acted in the
interests of the police. He was not in a position to shoot Sir
Rupert. If he had fired the shot I&mdash;I was on my feet between
him and Sir Rupert. He would have shot me."</p>

<p>"Shot you?" A sudden light came in Bobby's eyes. He turned to
the police officer. "Enough of this. Take a chair to the door and
sit down, constable. Inspector Williams will he here in a few
moments and then he can decide who is to be arrested."</p>

<p>He waited until the police officer had obeyed his orders, then
he turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale, you have given me an idea. I don't want to
worry you, but can you tell me what was happening during the few
seconds proceeding the firing of the shot. Sir Rupert was on his
feet speaking, I believe, to you."</p>

<p>"Yes," Myrtle spoke slowly. "today&mdash;today is my birthday.
I am twenty-one. Sir Rupert chose to make a little ceremony of my
becoming my own mistress. From what he said, there are quite a
number of interests involved."</p>

<p>"Such as your connection with Mackenzie stores?" Bobby nodded.
"I know that your father was a financial genius behind that
venture."</p>

<p>"Mr. Matthew Haffervale was wise to invest in my companies."
Godfrey Mackenzie's long face was turned up for the moment. "I am
happy today he was financially successful, through following my
advice."</p>

<p>"He was also the moving spirit behind the Tobacco
Trust&mdash;commonly attributed to Mr. Ibbotson. In fact, I
believe that only since Mr. Haffervale's death, and Sir Rupert's
accession to power as trustee for Miss Haffervale, has Mr.
Ibbotson had any real power in that trust."</p>

<p>"Grossly libellous!" the big man sprang upon his feet, his
face red with anger. "Mr. Haffervale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was asking Miss Haffervale what Sir Rupert was saying at
the moment he was shot," interjected Bobby.</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;" Ibbotson continued.</p>

<p>"I was asking Miss Haffervale." The newspaperman was courteous
but firm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parson had finished explaining the various ways in which
my fortune was invested," Myrtle continued. "When he finished Sir
Rupert stood up and congratulated me on becoming head of the
family. He said he regretted that he was not able to hand over to
me the sole control of my fortune&mdash;but that from that
hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That hour?" inquired Bobby.</p>

<p>"I was born at midday almost to the second." Myrtle smiled
faintly. "Sir Rupert was timing this meeting so that I assured
control of the income of my fortune exactly to the hour of my
birth. It was a little idea he had had for some time&mdash;that I
was to be installed at the very minute of coming of age. He was
saying that when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, Miss Haffervale." Again Bobby stopped the girl.
"Sir Rupert Haffervale was your trustee, under your late father's
will. Was he the sole trustee?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mark Parsons acted with him, I believe."</p>

<p>The newspaperman glanced at the lawyer who nodded
affirmatively.</p>

<p>"And in the event of one of the trustees dying who was to act?
Was an alternative trustee appointed under Mr. Matthew
Haffervale's will, or did the remaining trustee continue alone,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My trusteeship should revert to my successor in the legal
firm in which I am partner," Mark Parsons explained. "In the
event of Sir Rupert's demise Mr. Adam Ibbotson would assume the
post."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"What are you ah-ing about?" Adam Ibbotson sprang to his feet
again, glowering angrily at the newspaperman standing behind the
chair Sir Rupert Haffervale had lately occupied. "Are you
accusing me of Sir Rupert's murder? I was Matthew Haffervale's
greatest friend."</p>

<p>"So!" Bobby laughed gently. "There's not the slightest reason
why you should not assume the trusteeship, Mr. Ibbotson&mdash;so
long as Mr. Parsons is the other trustee to curb your tendency to
speculative investments."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to stay here to be insulted by any upstart
journalist."</p>

<p>Adam Ibbotson levered his big bulk from the chair and moved
towards the door. "You've said it, young man. I'm trustee of Miss
Haffervale's estate and that means I control the <i>Morning
Mirror</i>. I'll have a word to say to you, in those
offices."</p>

<p>"Please sit down Mr. Ibbotson," Bobby's voice was almost
humble. "We have to wait for Inspector Williams."</p>

<p>"The police can see me at my office."</p>

<p>Ibbotson continued to move towards the door.</p>

<p>The constable on guard rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was shot, Mr. Ibbotson." The journalist spoke
slowly.</p>

<p>"And you're flourishing a pistol," Ibbotson laughed gratingly.
"If this fool constable wasn't a coward, you'd be on your way to
the lock-up by this time."</p>

<p>"And you have a gun in your hip pocket, Mr. Ibbotson," Bobby's
voice was very suave.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" the big man swung round furiously,
"I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams."</p>

<p>The door opened silently to admit the police officer, closely
followed by a servant. The constable closed the door and set his
back up against it, relief showing in every line of his face.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?" Inspector Williams, quietly and with
a red good-humoured face, strode into the room and looked around
him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Bobby. Doin' theatricals with a big gun in your hand.
Jove, what's this." He turned to where Sir Rupert's body lay on
the couch, a handkerchief covering the still face. "Dead!"</p>

<p>"Listen Jim." The newspaperman smiled his relief. "Sir Rupert
was seated in this chair, some half-hour ago. He rose to his feet
to make a speech. Almost immediately he was shot by someone in
possession of a gun fitted with a silencer.</p>

<p>"On the table before him was his watch&mdash;four minutes
slow. The big fact you have to consider is this. If Sir Rupert's
watch had been correct he would have finished his speech and Miss
Haffervale would have been standing in his
place&mdash;here&mdash;preparatory of taking her seat at the head
of the table. If Sir Rupert's watch had not been four minutes
slow the bullet that pierced his heart would have lodged in her
breast."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">"AND that's the story." Bobby finished the
recital of the happenings at Madlands that morning, with a vague
gesture.</p>

<p>Inspector Williams had listened to the newspaperman with rapt
attention. He had asked many questions but had not elicited any
further material fact.</p>

<p>They were alone in the long dining-room, the scene of the
tragedy. Myrtle Haffervale had retired to her rooms. Lord
Carriday had accompanied Adam Ibbotson and Godfrey Mackenzie back
to the city. Only Mark Parsons and his managing clerk remained in
the big house. They were in the library, examining Sir Rupert's
papers.</p>

<p>"I'll hand it to you, Bobby." The burly Inspector pulled a
cigar from his breast pocket and bit off the end. "I couldn't
have handled the situation better myself."</p>

<p>"High praise!" the newspaperman turned to his companion with a
smile. Then seeing him strike a match he jumped to his feet.
"Here, don't do that, Williams!"</p>

<p>"Do what?" The Inspector stared at Bobby, amazingly.
"What&mdash;oh." He dropped the match burning his fingers.</p>

<p>"Try one of these," Bobby went to the table where he had sat
and brought back a box.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with this?" Williams took the cigar from
his mouth and eyed it suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;but I want to stay in this room for quite a
while and your Fumeralds-Funeralosa is likely to asphyxiate an
unaccustomed journalist. Good man! I can recommend that cigar.
Put a couple in your pocket; they may break off a bad habit. Now,
let's get to work. What about fingerprints?"</p>

<p>"On what?" The Inspector glanced around the room. "From what
you tell me there's fingerprints everywhere&mdash;and we don't
know who's who among them."</p>

<p>"No." Bobby spoke regretfully. "One day your Department will
wake up and insist that every man and woman who has more than
five thousand a year shall register fingerprints. With that
income the owner is either a potential victim or criminal."</p>

<p>"Sweeping, what?" Williams levered himself from his chair and
sauntered to the big table. He stopped before the seat Sir Rupert
had occupied and looked down at the open-faced watch for a
moment, pulled an old fashioned silver watch from his breast
pocket, and compared the times.</p>

<p>"Thought you said this watch was only four minutes slow?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?"</p>

<p>A couple of strides brought the journalist to the detective's
side. A slight whistle escaped his lips. He glanced at his
wristwatch.</p>

<p>"Seven minutes slow! Why, that watch loses."</p>

<p>He hesitated, plucking at his lower lip. A few seconds and he
lifted Sir Rupert's watch from the table and twisted the stem a
moment and handed the watch to the Inspector with a significant
gesture. A couple of turns of the stem-winder and Williams
replaced the watch on the table.</p>

<p>"So that's it. Another of your pet clues exploded. Sir Rupert
forgot to wind his watch last night."</p>

<p>"Last night?" Bobby bit at his nails. "Last night to mid-day
today is something over twelve hours. Yesterday morning today
would be about twenty eight hours. The night before last to date
would be thirty six hours or perhaps a couple more. Depends on
what time Sir Rupert goes to bed. Yes, you're about right. He
winds his watch at night-time."</p>

<p>"Important?"</p>

<p>"Maybe." The newspaperman lifted the match to his ear. "It's
run down, certainly. So that's how he came to be four minutes
slow at midday."</p>

<p>"You're theorising that Sir Rupert was planning to murder his
niece?"</p>

<p>"Not the first uncle that's had such an idea," Bobby grinned.
"For the time we can only take the points as they come to us. You
can't get away from Myrtle&mdash;Miss Haffervale's evidence. Sir
Rupert rose to his feet and commenced a speech at a couple or so
minutes to noon&mdash;his time. She says he was suggesting she
exchanged chairs with him; that as the new head of the house she
should sit at the head of the table."</p>

<p>"Umph!"</p>

<p>"Beastly, but what else is there?" The journalist paused.
"We've got to accept facts, and the first is that if Miss
Haffervale had followed Sir Rupert's suggestion&mdash;and I saw
her push back her chair to do so&mdash;she would have been seated
in Sir Rupert's chair at noon&mdash;his time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What made you stop her?" The Inspector gazed, curiously at
his companion.</p>

<p>"Damned if I know!" Bobby scratched his head. "Something told
me she shouldn't move. I acted on impulse."</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Have a good think." The detective dropped into the chair Sir
import had occupied. "There's such a thing as a subconscious
memory, Bobby."</p>

<p>Bobby shook his head. He had tried to puzzle out what had
influenced his actions. He had tried to visualise the faces of
the men at the table when Myrtle had pushed back her chair. Had a
look of dark triumph passed over the baronet's features as his
niece moved to respond to his invitation? Had there been a
tension In the broad back of Adam Ibbotson as the hour of noon
approached? What had the fixed smile meant on the lips of the old
solicitor? He put the thoughts from him with an impatient
gesture. They were all men of note in Sydney's business world.
Who would care to charge with conspiracy to murder, on such
evidence?</p>

<p>"We want facts&mdash;not theories, Bobby," The Inspector broke
in on the newspaperman's reverie. "Even the evidence of that
watch is not a fact. You're connecting that Sir Rupert planned to
murder his niece; that he planned she should change chairs with
him just before midday, the time when the pistol was to be fired.
You suggest that Sir Rupert was killed, instead of Miss
Haffervale, because his watch was four minutes slow. No good, old
son."</p>

<p>"And the search of the party revealed nothing?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing&mdash;but to confirm your accusation that Adam
Ibbotson was armed. But the doctor states the bullet could not
have been fired from where Ibbotson sat. Again, his gun was fully
loaded and had not recently been fired."</p>

<p>"Who fired the shot?" Bobby turned exasperatedly on the
detective.</p>

<p>"Ibbotson accuses you."</p>

<p>"Rot." With a swift motion Bobby pulled his gun from his
pocket and threw in on the table. "There's the gun. Myrtle
Haffervale will tell you she saw Sir Rupert hand it to me in the
library."</p>

<p>Williams picked up the automatic and snapped open the
magazine. It was empty. He looked up at Bobby, questioningly.</p>

<p>"The cartridges." The newspaperman grinned, emptying the
cartridges from his pocket on to the table. "Gee! I'm not falling
for that sort of Wild-West stuff. Couldn't tell Sir Rupert where
to take his gun, so emptied the cartridges out and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Held up half a dozen men with an empty gun." The Inspector
grinned. "Lord, boy, you took a risk with that man Ibbotson
heeled and in a beast of a temper."</p>

<p>"Damn Ibbotson." Bobby strode over to the window and looked
out over the Barrabarra Bay. "Say, Jim. Do you mind these windows
being open? It's stuffy in here."</p>

<p>"Go as far as you like." The detective was staring up at the
large crystal chandelier hanging the middle of the ceiling.
"There's no clues about, so you can't haze them."</p>

<p>The newspaperman pushed open the window and stepped out on the
stone terrace. Below him were the gardens of the house, running
down to the edge of the cliffs, some quarter of a mile away. A
few yards to his left were stone steps leading to the gardens. He
walked towards them&mdash;to stop hurriedly just before the top
step.</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Come here."</p>

<p>He waited, until the detective stood at his side.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>On the smooth stone was outlined the sole of a boot. The toe
was pointing towards the windows of the dining-room. It was not a
good impression, merely the outline of the boot&mdash;the wearer
having recently trampled over wet mould.</p>

<p>"Big man, that." The detective was on his knees. "Size of boot
about 10's."</p>

<p>"'Bout that. He came up the steps."</p>

<p>Bobby pointed to a row of wet marks on the seven stone steps.
"Trod lightly&mdash;the toe of the mark is better defined than
the heel. Where did he go?"</p>

<p>He traced back along the terrace. Nearly opposite the first of
the dining-room windows he stopped and pointed to the balustrade.
"Got over here."</p>

<p>"Can't see it."</p>

<p>Bobby picked from the stones a cigarette butt. Walking wide
from where the unknown man had paced, he went down the steps into
the gardens and along a path to a spot opposite the dining room
windows. There on the gravel were, the plain marks of the
boots.</p>

<p>"Good work!" Williams approved. "Where did he go then?"</p>

<p>"Across the grass, I guess." Bobby pointed down the gardens.
"The way he came. See, the gardeners have been watering the lawns
this morning. That's where the mould on his boots came from."</p>

<p>"Can you track him, Bobby?" The detective grinned at the
dubious look on the reporter's face. "But he doesn't matter. He
couldn't have fired the shot. If he had, Sir Rupert would have
been shot in the back, not the breast."</p>

<p>"But what was he doing here?"</p>

<p>A sudden light had come into the newspaperman's eyes.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert told me this morning that he had given orders that
no one was to be in the grounds until after mid-day."</p>

<p>"What was his game?" Williams scratched his chin. "He seems to
have taken a lot of precautions&mdash;with no object. Say, Bobby,
where are you going?"</p>

<p>"For a walk," the newspaperman grinned. "Comin'?"</p>

<p>The detective did not reply. He kept pace with Bobby as he
strode across the grass. Twice Williams spoke, to be answered
with grunts. They came to a path, leading between flower-beds.
Bobby led on without hesitation, his eyes continually searching
the path, the beds and the surrounding air. Suddenly he jumped to
one side and from under a standard rose-tree picked up a scrap of
paper.</p>

<p>"More clues, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Huh!" The journalist carefully smoothed out the screw of
paper, his eyes widening! On the centre of the paper were words:
"Madlands, Barrabarra Bay, nine to one."</p>

<p>"Good odds!" Williams grinned. "Say these cigars Sir Rupert
smoked are 'it.' Have one, Bobby?"</p>

<p>But the journalist had not waited. Placing the paper in his
pocket he was walking swiftly down the path to where a sundial
stood, the centre of a small circle of gravel. Again he stopped.
Close to the pillar of the sundial was the mark of a boot.</p>

<p>"Chappie came up here." Williams grunted. "Jove, no! This was
made, with a size seven boot."</p>

<p>"And not an hour old." Bobby was on his knees by the mark.
"See, there's the dust on the edges still. And with this wind
blowing that should have disappeared under an hour."</p>

<p>"Two men in the gardens&mdash;where Sir Rupert had prohibited
his gardeners this morning." The Inspector looked worried! "One
goes to the house, up the steps to the terrace. The
other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Either followed, or preceded him." The newspaperman spoke
from some distance ahead. "Look here, Jim. See. He took a
round-about track to the house. That means he knew the other man
was about and wished to avoid him."</p>

<p>"Which of 'em dropped that piece of paper you are treasuring
so greatly, Bobby?" the detective asked.</p>

<p>"Neither of them!" Bobby spoke confidently. "It was dropped by
a third man, who was watching the other two&mdash;and the
house."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">"THE third man?" Inspector Williams stopped
short, staring at the newspaperman. "That's a new one,
Bobby!"</p>

<p>"There was a third man in the gardens." Again the journalist
led on, making for the cliffs at the end of the gardens.</p>

<p>"Any proofs?"</p>

<p>"Get them presently. At present, the two men we have tracked
were not dogging each other; they were avoiding a third man."</p>

<p>"In that case, half Bondi may have been around the house." The
detective pulled at his moustache. "Anything published about Miss
Haffervale's coming of age?"</p>

<p>"Nothing relating to this affair at Madlands." Bobby stopped
suddenly and turned to the Inspector. "You've given me an idea.
Come on back to the house."</p>

<p>"What for? What about this third fellow? Going to drop
him?"</p>

<p>"He's gone," the newspaperman answered, indifferently. "So
have the other two. I wonder what scattered them?"</p>

<p>Again he changed direction making for the steps up to the
terrace where he had found the first boot marks. From there he
retraced the trail more carefully, stopping and marking boot
marks that would serve to identity the owner. At the sundial he
paused for some time; then cast about, keeping between the
footprints of the two first men. A long search and, under a low
bush, he came on what he sought&mdash;a scatter of footprints
where a man had crouched in hiding. On a patch of earth close by
he found the imprint of a left-boot. The detective gathered some
branches and twigs, carefully covering the mark.</p>

<p>"Where now, Bobby?" Williams smiled as the newspaperman turned
towards the house.</p>

<p>"A talk with Mark Parsons."</p>

<p>Bobby lingered to allow the detective to catch up to him. "Got
any ideas, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Not one," the Inspector answered, candidly. "If you weren't
here I'd be sitting in that dining-room chewing a stogie and
wondering on which of Sydney's crooks I could pin a medal!"</p>

<p>"Crooks?" Bobby stopped and glanced back at his companion with
scorn. "I handed you six when you arrived."</p>

<p>"Crooks?"</p>

<p>"Yah! Two lawyers, three monopolists and a dud secretary."</p>

<p>"Held under the empty gun of a sleuth journalist," Williams
laughed.</p>

<p>"Should have said seven, then."</p>

<p>The newspaperman reached the steps, and ran up on to the
terrace. In the dining-room he paused and looked around him.</p>

<p>"Say, Williams, how was Sir Rupert shot?"</p>

<p>"I'm listening." The Inspector dropped the end of his cigar in
an ashtray and drew another from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Item, a dozen chairs, assorted. One dining table, with a
heavy crystal chandelier hung with prisms above it. One sideboard
and a small table, set close to one of the two doors. A cabinet
gramophone and a fireplace with an imitation Adams mantelpiece.
Walls papered. Now where did that shot come from?"</p>

<p>"You're forgetting the mirrors. One over the sideboard, and
the other opposite, over the mantelpiece you defame by stating it
is imitation."</p>

<p>Bobby strode to the table, looking down on a long chalk mark
on the polished surface.</p>

<p>"I got the doctor to draw that," he said, at length. "It marks
as nearly as possible the course the bullet took. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put the arrow at the opposite end; get a jury to swear
they'll convict on that evidence and there'll be one less
journalist in Sydney's newspaper world."</p>

<p>"Looks bad." Bobby grinned. "Points right to where I was
seated. All you've got to do is to be able to swear that Sir
Rupert didn't twist or turn after he was shot, and&mdash;" he
shrugged his shoulders carelessly. "Give me one degree of turn
and that bullet passed immediately under that chandelier." With a
light vault he gained the table top. A motion of his hand and the
detective lifted a chair to beside him. Bobby mounted the chair
and examined the prisms of the chandelier, using a pencil to
deflect the crystals, when necessary.</p>

<p>"Got a stool there?" He looked down at the detective. "I want
to get higher."</p>

<p>"I'll have a ladder brought." The detective moved towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Scats! I don't want anything touched, just for the moment."
The journalist pulled a powerful magnifying glass from his pocket
and standing tip-toe carefully scanned the lower lines of
crystals.</p>

<p>"Say, Jim! There's a foot-stool under that armchair by the
fireplace. Phew! I wonder when they cleaned this last?"</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" Williams asked curiously as he
lifted the footstool to the chair. "Keep your feet still, man.
Now the left, that's it. Steady?"</p>

<p>"All right, thanks! What am I looking for? Oh&mdash;" The
young man's body stiffened. For some seconds he was silent, then
slipped the glass into his pocket and looked down at the
detective.</p>

<p>"Say, Jim, think this scaffolding will bear your fairy
weight?"</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk, if you think it's worth while."</p>

<p>"Then come up here. First, mark this prism I'm touching with
my pencil. Got it? Good!"</p>

<p>The journalist leaped lightly to the table and slid to the
floor. As the detective, moving heavily, reached the chair, Bobby
called to him and handed him the magnifying glass. The Inspector
climbed to the stool on the chair and raised his head, close
against the crystals of the chandelier.</p>

<p>"Further to the right Two more. There! Next that one that's
badly chipped. There! Don't touch it with your hands man!
Good!"</p>

<p>Bobby waited, impatiently, while the detective carefully
examined the indicated crystal. At length Williams flipped the
glass into his pocket, and reached up. Holding the prism with him
handkerchief on a folded newspaper, held flat.</p>

<p>"Fingerprint." Williams lumbered down from his perch to the
floor. "What the devil's a fingerprint doing there? A newie, too;
and the chandelier hasn't been cleaned for donkey's years!"</p>

<p>"Got your powders and paints." The newspaperman was leading to
the head of the table. He bent to the polished surface, scanning
the table. "Here, Jim. This is where Sir Rupert caught the edge
of the table; just before the shot was fired."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert?" the detective starred.</p>

<p>"Go on, you chump!" Bobby's impatience burst bounds. "Get one
of those fingerprints visible. I want to see what Sir Rupert's
trade-mark looks like."</p>

<p>Williams shrugged his broad shoulders and produced his
sufflator. A few moments and a row of fingerprints stood out
along the edge of the table, in yellow powder. Bobby shifted the
newspaper on which the prism rested, across the table to before
the detective. Without a word Williams used the sufflator on the
fingerprints, barely visible. For some full minute he compared
the impressions. At length, he looked up, a queer expression on
his face.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert's?" The Inspector nodded. "I thought so. Print
about twenty-four hours old, so far as I can guess. Now, tell me
why Sir Rupert wanted to climb up to that chandelier within the
past twenty-four hours?"</p>

<p>"The pistol?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" Bobby stared in mock commiseration at the
detective. "And I thought you recognised that this murder had
been committed by someone with brains!"</p>

<p>"You've been suggesting that Sir Rupert set a trap to murder
his niece!" retorted the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Far as I see, I'll suggest a hundred possibilities before we
strike the track of the real murderer." Bobby moved to the door.
"Got the key, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Where now?"</p>

<p>"Mark Parsons in the library?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know. He said he would not leave until be had
seen me again. What's the big idea?"</p>

<p>"Just a small one&mdash;the key of this door?"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" Williams laughed uncertainly. He turned the key
and flung open the door. A constable stepped on one side. "Mr.
Parsons in the library, Allan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Haven't seen him since he went in."</p>

<p>"Guess he's there." Bobby strode cross the hall and turned the
handle of the library door. With a sudden jerk he flung the door
open and entered quickly, followed by the Inspector. Mark Parsons
looked up at the sudden interruption. A frown gathered on his
face at sight of the journalist.</p>

<p>"You! What do you want? I'm very, busy!"</p>

<p>"So I see." Bobby gazed around the room with an air of
wonderment. The room looked as if a quick search had been made by
some agitated person. "Found the will?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert's will is in my office," Mark Parson answered
shortly.</p>

<p>"So!" The newspaperman crossed to a low-armed chair. "Sir
Rupert is a methodical man, Mr. Parsons?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was a business man."</p>

<p>"Same thing I suppose. Tidy and methodical, eh?"</p>

<p>"A very tidy and methodical man."</p>

<p>Fred Frazer, Parsons' managing clerk, looked round, some
suspicion showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Get a fit if he came in here, then." Bobby lit a cigarette
and blew a series of rings towards the ceiling. "Often cleans his
chandelier?"</p>

<p>"Clean his chandelier?" Mark Parsons swung round from the
desk, suddenly. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Rather a fine crystal chandelier in the dining-room," Bobby
continued to stare after the smoke-rings. "Suppose Sir Rupert
thought it too valuable to entrust to a servant&mdash;so cleaned
it himself."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" The lawyer stuttered in anger. "Sir Rupert
could afford to pay servants for that work."</p>

<p>"Wanted to see if the servants had done what they were paid
for." The newspaperman shifted to a more comfortable position.
"Very tall man, Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Trayne?" Frazer turned from his work,
laughingly. Parsons had bent to examine the documents before him,
ignoring the journalist. "What's up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Dust. Been examining that chandelier, but had to get a chair
and footstool to reach to it. Not so tall as Sir Rupert,
unfortunately."</p>

<p>"No?" Frazer laughed again. "Only about four inches taller If
you want someone to tell you."</p>

<p>"Strange." Bobby sat upright. "Now tell me. How is it I had to
use a table, a chair and a footstool to reach up to the
chandelier, when Sir Rupert just reached up and left his
fingerprints on one of the prisms."</p>

<p>"A lie!" Parson was on his feet, glowering down at the
journalist. "Sir Rupert never did that."</p>

<p>The lawyer, swung round to face the detective. "Inspector
Williams, will you please remove this person. I'm busy and want
to get back to the city."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert never made his desk in that litter." Bobby winked
openly at the Inspector. "Nice tidy man, Sir Rupert. Say, Mr.
Parsons, you'll not find that mortgage there."</p>

<p>"Mortgage? What mortgage." The solicitor had, suddenly become
pale. "What on earth are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"The mortgage you have searched this room for." The
newspaperman spoke courteously and plainly. "The mortgage held by
Sir Rupert securing the very large sums he advanced to the
Bralley Estate."</p>

<p>"You know where it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where is it."</p>

<p>"Quite safe, Mr. Mark Parsons&mdash;but not in this room!"
Bobby turned to the Inspector. "Say, Jim, I'll have you to help
Mr. Mark Parsons in his arduous task. Of course, the police will
not allow any papers to be taken from this house until they have
completed their inquiry into the murder of Sir Rupert Haffervale.
S' long, for a time."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Parsons asked the question, his face
still white.</p>

<p>"To have a little chat with Myrtle&mdash;Miss
Haffervale&mdash;if she's well enough to see me." He rose lazily
from the chair and strolled to the door.</p>

<p>"I forbid you." Parsons almost choked with anger. "Inspector,
throw that man out of this house. I forbid you to go near Miss
Haffervale. And you needn't go back to the <i>Mirror</i> offices.
You're sacked. Understand. Sacked!"</p>

<p>"Dear me." Bobby turned at the door. "And you've already
forgotten the five years contract you prepared for my signature,
a short three months ago. Bye, bye, Parsons. See you later. Jim.
May have news for you then."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">BOBBY strolled out of the library, leaving the
solicitor fuming with vexation. As he was about to close the door
he looked back, and, catching the Inspector's eyes, winked. The
answering nod assured him that the detective had not missed the
point.</p>

<p>The journalist had fired a shot in the dark when he spoke of
the Bralley mortgages. Peculiarly, those mortgages were one of
the few matters connected with the Haffervale Trust of which he
had knowledge.</p>

<p>Some few weeks previous he had been in Sir Rupert Haffervale's
offices in the <i>Mirror</i>'s building and had been asked to
witness his chief's signature to some documents. Casual words
between Sir Rupert and Parsons had informed him that the papers
signed were mortgages over part of the Bralley Estates. Sir
Rupert had kept him talking until the solicitor had left,
insisting that the papers remained with him. Then, he had asked
Bobby to carry them to the clerk in charge of the <i>Mirror</i>'s
strong-room.</p>

<p>The mention of the Bralley Mortgages had upset the solicitor.
The newspaperman wondered why. What did they contain to cause
Parsons to lose his temper so completely? Why had he made so
rapid and untidy a search among Sir Rupert's papers?</p>

<p>For the moment he put the question from him. He had much to
think of&mdash;much to co-ordinate into a connected story if he
was to trace down Sir Rupert's murderer. With a shrug of his
shoulders he moved a few further paces into the hall. He did not
want Parsons to come out of the library and find him near the
door. The solicitor might think he had been eavesdropping.</p>

<p>Who had murdered Sir Rupert Haffervale? Who had fired the
silent fatal shot, almost at the moment Sir Rupert had proposed
to change chairs with his niece? From the moment he had entered
the house, the newspaperman had found himself surrounded by an
atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. He had wondered at the
precautions surrounding what was, after all, a mere
formality&mdash;the handing over of her income to the heiress of
the Haffervale millions. Sir Rupert's actions, his very manner,
had been illogical and only explainable by fear of some tragic
happening.</p>

<p>In the dining-room, during the few minutes of the ceremony
there had been an atmosphere of strain&mdash;almost
fear&mdash;among the persons assembled. Sir Rupert had been
uneasy; Myrtle had appeared watchful and distrait. There had been
no signs of friendship between the men around the table. They
feared and distrusted each other. They were
antagonistic&mdash;indeed, almost to the point of open
rupture.</p>

<p>For what reason? Bobby knew much of the commercial politics of
the city of Sydney. He knew that Matthew Haffervale had been the
financial genius of the century&mdash;with a finger in every
large amalgamation that had taken place during his years. He knew
that the old man had ruled his associates with an iron hand; that
his death had occasioned relief to many of the so-called captains
of industry. More, he knew that Sir Rupert had attempted to
follow out the policy of autocracy and intimidation initiated by
his brother&mdash;and had failed. He had held his position as
head of the Haffervale trust mainly by the weight of the wealth
he controlled. His associates in the various organisations had
been rebellious; waiting for the moment they could combine and
overthrow an autocrat whose feet, they knew, were of clay.</p>

<p>Seven men had sat around the table in the dining-room at
Madlands and those seven men had hated each other. Had their
hatred grown to a point when each man could, individually,
contemplate murder? If he could answer to that question in the
affirmative, Bobby realised he would have to reorganise his
theories concerning the murder. The fatal shot had been fired at
the knight, not at his niece, as he had supposed. But in that
case, he would have to find a fresh explanation of the slow watch
and the proposed change of seats at the hour of noon.</p>

<p>Into whatever story he constructed he had to bring three
unknown men prowling about the grounds of Madlands at the time of
the celebrations taking place in the dining-room. Who were these
men? What interest had they in the ceremony, or the men and women
participating in it? Why had they taken so much pains to avoid
each other? Why had their interests centred most obviously on the
dining room windows?</p>

<p>Bobby shrugged his shoulders, disgustedly. Perhaps Myrtle
Haffervale could resolve some of his doubts. He had not had a
chance to question her. Now&mdash;</p>

<p>He glanced around the hall, questioningly; then sought the
bell to summon a servant. He would send a message to Myrtle
asking for an interview. Williams would keep the solicitor
engaged for some considerable time. As he moved forward he
stiffened and halted, staring into a dark corner, behind one of
the massive marble pillars supporting the glass roof. Someone was
hiding there.</p>

<p>Someone had seated himself in the hall in a position where he
could keep unobserved watch on the library door! Who had an
interest in the solicitor's search of the dead man's papers?</p>

<p>For a moment Bobby frowned thoughtfully; then stepped quickly
forward.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gerald." The newspaperman dropped onto the wide lounge
beside the secretary. "Got a result yet?"</p>

<p>"Result?" Gerald Preston turned a sullen face towards the
journalist. "A result on what?"</p>

<p>"On the problem of the murder of your employer&mdash;he was
murdered, you know."</p>

<p>Bobby stretched his long legs before him, looking down at his
well polished tan shoes with appreciation. "Quite a mystery,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Mystery?" Gerald made as if to rise. "I thought you turned it
into an imitation wild-west stunt with your holding us up at the
point of a gun."</p>

<p>"Good, wasn't it," Bobby chuckled. "I've often wondered what I
should do if I chanced to be on the spot when a murder was
committed. Ran true to form&mdash;though I say it."</p>

<p>"What's going on in there?" The secretary nodded towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Don't know. Parsons 's got the willies. Blew up when I
suggested he wouldn't find the papers there that he was after.
Went straight up in the air and threatened me with the sack. I
left it to Williams to bring him to earth again."</p>

<p>"What does he think?" Gerald turned to face the newspaperman.
"Will he let us go?"</p>

<p>"Go? Where?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go to the city."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert's business?"</p>

<p>The secretary hesitated. "I'm not allowed to say."</p>

<p>"Sorry. 'Course; Sir Rupert's business is Mark Parsons' now,
or, at any rate, for the moment. S'pose he's confirmed your
instructions."</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;" Gerald jumped to his feel angrily. "Look
here, Bobby Trayne! I've stood all I'm going to stand from you
today. You may be the big noise down at the <i>Mirror</i>'s
offices but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going to sack me? You're the third, and Sir Rupert hasn't
been dead a couple of hours! Lucky I got that contract, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Damn the contract!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, old son. It's too good to damn." The newspaperman
paused a few seconds, carefully lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Don't go to the city, Gerald. I'd stick tight to this house,
if I were you."</p>

<p>"So I'm suspect!" A surge of colour flooded the young man's
face. "Of all the cheek! Why, I had my back to Sir Rupert when
the shot was fired. I was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Staring at him in a small, round mirror hung over my head,"
amended Bobby. "Say, Gerald, what was Sir Rupert like to work
for?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hard."</p>

<p>"Thought so. Made enemies quicker than friends."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was a successful man."</p>

<p>"Was he?" Bobby stretched himself, luxuriously. "Now, I've had
an Idea that he was merely Matthew Haffervale's paid man."</p>

<p>"He had a big holding in the <i>Mirror</i>."</p>

<p>"Over which Matt Haffervale and his heiress held a piece of
paper, lacking a date. Press a rubber date stamp on that paper
and Miss Haffervale's hold becomes considerably increased."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert paid off the mortgage&mdash;Say Bobby what's your
game? I'm not talking of Sir Rupert's business! If you want to
get information, go to Mark Parsons. He'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me to go to hell," Bobby amended. "I'd rather take that
from you, Gerald. What are you going to do? Stop on as private
secretary to the heiress?"</p>

<p>"I'm to see Mr. Ibbotson tomorrow."</p>

<p>"So he's to become the big noise. Think I'll see him before
you, Gerald."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'm investigating the death of Sir Rupert Haffervale. There's
questions to answer, and you&mdash;" The newspaperman allowed his
voice to trail away.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Who hated Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>The secretary laughed shortly. "Most people. All successful
men suffer from that."</p>

<p>"Except, of course, Adam Ibbotson." Bobby laughed. "He'll hate
to step into the dead knight's shoes."</p>

<p>"Love him?" The Secretary stared at Bobby, in blank amazement.
"Why, only the other day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I may as well tell you." Gerald made a gesture of
resignation. "I'd been out&mdash;Sir Rupert sent me in to Bondi
to send off some telegrams he didn't want the servants to see. As
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Telephone working all right, Gerald?"</p>

<p>"'Course. Why?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert ran a telegram deposit at the local
post-office?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;What&mdash;Oh, I see. I was sent to the post office
to be out of the way."</p>

<p>"You didn't know Adam was to call?"</p>

<p>"No." The secretary abandoned his former reserve. "I didn't
know he was in the house until, just as I got to the library
door, he barged out. In the doorway he turned and
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Careful, Gerald. I want the exact words."</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;" The secretary paused a moment. "He said:
'You're a damned smooth jack-in-office. Go to hell! I won't take
orders from you.'"</p>

<p>"Go to hell!" Bobby lay back, digesting the information.
"Gerry, you knew the noble knight quite well. Do you think he
took his pal's advice."</p>

<p>"Don't think he had much opinion&mdash;after what happened in
the dining-room, today." Gerald frowned. "The dumb brute! I'd
have liked to&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Have fired that bullet!" The newspaperman murmured the words.
"But, you didn't, Gerry? Let's see! 'Course, I can get the info
in the city, but it would save time if&mdash;Ibbotson's a wealthy
man?"</p>

<p>"Haffervale money." The secretary sniffed. "Some with
Mackenzie. Both of them Haffervale dummies. Old Matt had them
well under his thumb."</p>

<p>"And Sir Rupert didn't let up?" Bobby laughed.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was his own best friend."</p>

<p>"And pals with no one else." There was a slight smile of
satisfaction on the newspaperman's lips. "I thought so."</p>

<p>He turned quickly to the secretary. "You say Sir Rupert's
holdings in the <i>Mirror</i> are free&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"I believe Sir Rupert paid them off some little while ago."
Gerald hesitated. "Yes, I'm certain I'm right, about the time he
signed that contract with you. Say, Bobby, you're lucky; if you
hadn't that contract you'd be hunting a job, now. The contract's
water-tight?"</p>

<p>"Drew it up myself&mdash;with the aid of the best solicitor I
knew. I did the newspaper side of the contract and Arnold saw to
it that the legal part bound them tight. Oh, I'm satisfied. What
of you?"</p>

<p>"Ibbotson says he wants a private secretary with knowledge of
the Haffervale affairs."</p>

<p>"Let him want." A hard tone came in the newspaperman's voice.
"You stick here."</p>

<p>"But Miss Haffervale won't want me. She has no
business&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not until she marries or reaches the age of thirty. I know
that." Bobby grinned. "Same time, I've got a hunch she'll want a
man about the place&mdash;a man who can&mdash;Say Gerry, able to
handle a gun?"</p>

<p>"A gun?"</p>

<p>"Revolver, pistol, automatic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've fired one."</p>

<p>"And still alive&mdash;then you're safe." The journalist
pulled a small squat nosed automatic from his pocket and passed
it to the secretary. "Look here. It works that way. Understand?
Just like this. Got it? Now, don't forget. It you've got to use
it see that you're close up against the man you want to hit. From
the way you handle a gun you should touch the second button on
his waistcoat before you fire&mdash;and then he'll want a
corporation to catch the bullet. Still, you're the best bid on
the shelf. Understand, anyone coming at Myrtle Haffervale gets a
pellet from you. Shoot first and ask their business afterwards is
your best rule."</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet and walked into the body of the
hall, leaving the secretary staring at the automatic in his hand.
Almost at the foot of the stairs Bobby turned and went back to
where Gerald was seated.</p>

<p>"By the way, old man. If you want to go into the city, all
serene. But, take a tip from a pal, and don't pay that
debt&mdash;just yet."</p>

<p>Again the newspaperman turned and walked to the foot of the
broad flight of stairs. As his foot reached the first step he
hesitated. From above came the sounds of high heels,
"tap-tapping" on the polished parquet flooring. He drew back,
lounging against one of the newel-posts.</p>

<p>Dropping the cigarette from his lips Bobby carefully ground it
to powder and drew out his cigarette case, selecting a fresh
smoke. The sounds of the high-heels came near the head of the
stairs, then were suddenly muffled. The newspaperman grinned,
keeping, his eyes fixed oh the toe of his boot. The girl had come
from her rooms, walking close beside the balustrade of the
gallery, peeping over into the hall below. At the head of the
stairs she had stepped back on the heavy carpet.</p>

<p>He waited a few moments, until he knew she was some distance
down the long flight of stairs then looked up. He caught his
breath with a little gasp. What had happened to the girl?</p>

<p>In one of the upstairs rooms lay all that remained of Sir
Rupert Haffervale. Coming from her rooms to the head of the
stairs she must have looked towards the door of the
death-chamber. Yet in her eyes&mdash;in the whole contour of her
face&mdash;was expressed relief, almost happiness.</p>

<p>Bobby Trayne had met Myrtle Haffervale on several occasions.
He had pitied the girl&mdash;silent, dull, heavy; as if
overweighted by the burden of gold she had inherited from her
dead father.</p>

<p>Now she was changed&mdash;gloriously. Above the average height
of women, dark, with a wonderful clarity of skin, her face
relieved by a pair of sparkling brown eyes, flecked with little
gold spots, her beauty struck him a physical blow. He caught his
breath sharply; his hands clenched so that the nails bit deep
into his palms. What a girl! From her smooth glossy hair to the
perfect silk clad ankles, she was perfect&mdash;adorable!</p>

<p>The wonder&mdash;homage&mdash;faded from Bobby's broad,
pleasant features to be replaced by a frown of perplexity as the
girl advanced to where he stood awaiting her. She glanced sharply
at his face and a little friendly smile dawned on her lips. She
held out her hand, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trayne. I was wondering where I would find you." Her
voice came almost in a whisper. "I must speak to you
soon&mdash;and alone. Where can we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Bobby," Inspector Williams's booming voice sounded from
the library door. "I want you. Mr. Parsons has just told
me&mdash;Beg pardon, Miss Haffervale, didn't see you. Trust
you're&mdash;er&mdash;I want to say&mdash;I hope you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite, Inspector." The light in the girl's eyes glowed to a
smile. "You want Mr. Trayne, I believe."</p>

<p>"When you've finished with him, please, Miss Haffervale." The
detective turned in the direction of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Cruel!" Bobby spoke lowly. "I did not think you would abandon
me to the enemy, like that."</p>

<p>"I thought Inspector Williams was your friend, Mr. Trayne."
Myrtle smiled, demurely. "Please, don't keep him
waiting&mdash;and&mdash;Mr. Trayne, when you have finished with
my hand. Thank you. I know journalists are acquisitive persons,
but&mdash;" As Bobby turned away in mock disgust the murmur came
to him. "The seat behind the sundial in the gardens, in half an
hour."</p>

<p>BOBBY TOOK a couple of steps towards the dining-room where the
Inspector awaited him, then turned and watched the girl out of
sight. Immediately she had disappeared he strode across to the
lounge where Gerald still waited.</p>

<p>"Say Gerry. What private inquiry agency does Adam Ibbotson
look to for protection?"</p>

<p>"Carruthers." The secretary looked up startled. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Not much, 'cept they've got their work cut out!" As he spoke
the newspaperman turned to the dining-room and entered, closing
the door carefully behind him.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR WILLIAMS was standing at the far end
of the room, staring out of the long windows on to the gardens.
At Bobby's entry he turned and held out a piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Looks as if we've got the murderer, Bobby," he observed,
without enthusiasm. "Lor', to think of it. A British&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Got to have a better reason than that, old son." The
newspaperman lounged across the room. He glanced at the scrap of
paper and laid it on the table. "Worst of you Headquarter 'johns'
is that you fill up on such detective fiction, in your large
spare time, that a title is a sure road to the gallows."</p>

<p>"We got a newspaperman once," Williams remarked darkly.
"And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have held it against the profession ever since. So your two
best bids are Lord Carriday and Bobby Trayne." He turned and
pointed to the chalk mark on the table. "Allowing a small
deflection from that theory either of them is a good
suspect&mdash;except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That two other persons might just as well come under the
clouds gathering on your brow," the journalist laughed.</p>

<p>"Read that paper?"</p>

<p>"Two lines and a signature torn from the lower half of a full
sheet of newspaper. Worded:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"'You're not fit to live, Rupert Haffervale! If
you go on with this scheme I shall be strongly tempted to stop
you by means in my power.&mdash;Carriday.'"</p><br>

<p>"Good enough."</p>

<p>"Except that Adam Ibbotson, but a few days ago, told Rupert
Haffervale that he was a damned smooth jack-in-office. To go to a
place unmentionable and that he refused to take orders from
him."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>"A third suspect for you. Notice anything about Miss
Haffervale, just now?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"An air of relief&mdash;as if a big weight had been lifted
from her shoulders."</p>

<p>"That girl." The Inspector stared at the newspaperman in
astonishment. "You don't suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd punch the head of anyone who even hinted at such a
thing." Bobby spoke with sudden heat.</p>

<p>"Yet you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to&mdash;school!" The newspaperman strode down the room to
where he had sat through the conference. For some minutes he
stood facing the table, mentally visioning the scene just before
the fatal shot was fired.</p>

<p>"Taken a review of the dramatic person in this crime,
Williams?"</p>

<p>"What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Ideas chaotic&mdash;but&mdash;" He turned impulsively to the
Inspector. "I hate to say it, Jim, but in this we've got to take
in all possibilities. Myrtle&mdash;Myrtle Haffervale's relieved
at the death of her uncle. Sounds horrible and no doubt, poor
girl, she hates herself for her unbidden thoughts."</p>

<p>He turned to the chair on which he had sat and from under it
picked up a copy of that day's <i>Mirror</i>.</p>

<p>"Seen this?" His finger indicated a paragraph in the serial
column. Williams read the few lines and whistled.</p>

<p>"A marriage has been arranged&mdash;Lord Carriday and Myrtle
Haffervale. Whew! Poor girl."</p>

<p>"A British earldom&mdash;and colonial wealth!" The bright
tones could not hide the feeling in the journalist's voice.</p>

<p>"You mean lucky girl, don't you?" Remember he's not one of the
vast army of impecunious peers searching the world for rich
brides. He's got money&mdash;oodles of it&mdash;perhaps more than
Myrtle, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a reputation?" The Inspector spoke significantly.</p>

<p>"A title covers much. Add to it enormous wealth and&mdash;and
the Ten Commandments are snowed under so deep
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, get along with your theories!" Williams spoke after a
quick glance at the newspaperman's face. "What of the
others?"</p>

<p>"Gerald Preston had no cause to love Sir Rupert." Bobby had
recovered his pose of indifference.</p>

<p>"Who had? That's not a cause for murder, Bobby."</p>

<p>"No." The newspaperman grinned. "Pass Gerald. Then comes Adam
Ibbotson. There's bad blood there. Carriday might not have got
all he wanted&mdash;with the promise of Myrtle's hand in
marriage. That scrap of paper looks good or bad&mdash;for him.
Parsons had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Williams was staring at the journalist in amazement.
"Lor' man. Was there no one in the room free from suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Know anything of the Bralley Trust?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"A big block of land in Queensland. Said to be oil under it.
Matt Haffervale invested slightly in the speculation. Sir Rupert
avoided it for a time; then, just before his death, put in a wad.
Mark Parsons is one of the trustees and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God, man, speak out," Williams burst out
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Mark Parsons commenced a rapid, disorderly search for the
mortgage deeds Rupert Haffervale signed a few months
ago&mdash;within a few minutes of the knight's death. You heard,
and saw."</p>

<p>The Inspector bit at the ends of his fingers, watching Bobby
keenly. When the journalist did not continue he spoke again,
drumming on the glass with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>"You haven't accounted for Godfrey Mackenzie and Parsons'
managing clerk. What's his name&mdash;oh, Frederick Frazer."</p>

<p>"For the present&mdash;no." Bobby paused. "I tell you this,
Jim, Within the next twenty-four hours your fingers will itch to
get hold of both their collars."</p>

<p>"Nine persons in a closed room. One murdered, and eight
suspected. The good Lord!" The Inspector turned impatiently and
strode up and down the room. "What a puzzle! If only there was a
single definite clue."</p>

<p>"The gun?"</p>

<p>"I searched the room again while waiting for you. Not a sign
of it."</p>

<p>"Who's been in here?"</p>

<p>The Inspector turned to the door, opened it and beckoned in
the constable on duty.</p>

<p>"Who's been in here between the time I left and when I
returned, Allan?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons, Lord Carriday, Mr. Mackenzie, Mr. Ibbotson, and
Mr. Preston. Mr. Parsons brought his clerk in with him,
sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All together?"</p>

<p>"No, singly, sir. You didn't tell me to keep them out."</p>

<p>"You let them in and shut the door behind them."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right." As the constable left the room Williams turned to
the journalist and made a gesture of despair. Bobby laughed,
turning to the open window."Say, where are you going?"</p>

<p>"For a stroll on the grounds." Bobby looked at his watch. It
was nearly time to keep his appointment with Myrtle.</p>

<p>"Think I'll come with you. There's nothing to do here."</p>

<p>"There's less for you to do where I'm going." There was a
strong significance in the journalist's tones. "If I were
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lady to see you, Inspector."</p>

<p>"A lady to see me?" Williams swung round to see Keston, the
butler, standing in the doorway. "What's her name?"</p>

<p>"She would not give it. She said that you did not know her,
sir."</p>

<p>"What's she like?"</p>

<p>"Very heavily veiled, sir. I thought I recognised her, but I
cannot give her a name."</p>

<p>The detective swung round to where the journalist had been
standing, but Bobby had disappeared. A couple of quick steps took
Williams to the window. Far across the lawns Bobby was striding
towards the cliffs. For a moment the Inspector hesitated, then
turned to the servant. "All right. Show her in."</p>

<p>He waited, pacing impatiently up and down the room. What was
Bobby Trayne after? He had a great admiration for the
newspaperman's abilities&mdash;his almost uncanny knack of
jumping to right conclusions on the most flimsy evidence. He knew
that Bobby was hot on some trail, and this damn-fool woman
prevented him joining in the chase.</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams." A soft voice spoke from the doorway.</p>

<p>"Yes. And you, madam?"</p>

<p>The veiled woman did not answer. Williams surveyed her
curiously. He placed her age in the late twenties. Slender and
small, she appeared overweighted by the transparent scarf that
shrouded hat and features.</p>

<p>"Your name, Madam." The Inspector spoke impatiently.</p>

<p>"They tell me Sir Rupert has been&mdash;been murdered." The
light voice quivered. "Is that&mdash;it is not true, is it?" The
woman advanced a step, laying her hand on the detective's
arm.</p>

<p>"They? Who?" The detective spoke quickly. "Who told you Sir
Rupert was&mdash;dead? Come now, madam! Who are you?"</p>

<p>A moment's hesitation and the woman threw back her veil.
Williams looked at her curiously. A pure ash blonde; her face
pale, the eyelids puffed by recent tears.</p>

<p>"You know me?" she asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I do, Madam. What is it you want to know?"</p>

<p>"I have been told that Sir Rupert Haffervale is dead. Is that
true?" The woman was holding her emotions in check with obvious
effort.</p>

<p>"Your name, madam. I can't answer questions from people I know
nothing about."</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Mackenzie."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie? The wife of Mr. Godfrey Mackenzie."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You say someone told you Sir Rupert had been
murdered?&mdash;Who was that?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;we&mdash;live close by. About a mile and a half away.
Mr. Mackenzie came home, just now, and told me Sir Rupert had
been murdered. Oh, tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;it is not
true."</p>

<p>"'Fraid it is." Williams spoke grimly. Why had Godfrey
Mackenzie, on leaving Madlands, gone to his home and informed his
wife of Sir Rupert's violent death?</p>

<p>"Dead!" The woman spoke in a hushed whisper. "Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and covered her face with her hands,
sobbing quietly. Williams turned and paced to the windows,
searching the gardens for signs of Bobby Trayne. He felt he was
not qualified to deal with the situation. Mrs. Mackenzie was
crying over the death of Sir Rupert Haffervale. What did that
mean? He racked his brains to discover a logical reason. So far
as he know there was no blood relationship between the
Haffervales and the Mackenzies. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, come, madam. This won't do." He spoke gruffly. "Mr.
Mackenzie shouldn't have frightened you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Frightened me!" The woman sprang to her feet in sudden anger.
"There isn't anything he would not do. The beast! The brute! Oh,
how I hate him. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There! Enough of that." The detective, fearing hysteria,
spoke brutally. "Looks like we'll make better progress if you sit
down quietly and answer my questions. Now, what's your
name&mdash;Christian names I mean."</p>

<p>"Alice Maude."</p>

<p>"Alice Maude Mackenzie. Well, what relation are you to Sir
Rupert?"</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;was&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;friend."</p>

<p>"A friend?" The Inspector's tones showed his unbelief. "So Mr.
Mackenzie stopped on his journey to town to inform you that your
mutual friend had been murdered?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackenzie was upset at the death of his friend?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackenzie was not Sir Rupert's friend."</p>

<p>"Only a business connection?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then Sir Rupert and Mr. Mackenzie were business
acquaintances, and you and Sir Rupert friends. Were you friendly
with Miss Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"But very friendly with Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>For some moments the woman sat without answering. Williams
repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Oh you're as bad as my&mdash;my husband." Alice Mackenzie
spoke in sudden anger. "He accused me and Sir Rupert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of being more than friends, eh?"</p>

<p>"You brute!" Sullen anger flared in the light blue eyes. Yes, he said that. He said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he had proof? Answer me," the Inspector continued, as the
woman did not speak. "Answer me!"</p>

<p>"He caught&mdash;Yes, he had proof." She flung up her head
proudly. "Why should I care? Yes, yes, yes&mdash;<i>yes</i>."</p>

<p>"You think that your husband&mdash;Godfrey
Mackenzie&mdash;murdered Sir Rupert Haffervale." Williams spoke
in low, intense tones.</p>

<p>"I thought he would murder me," Alice Mackenzie answered under
her breath. "He would have, but he feared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert." Again rage flamed in the woman's face. "Oh, yes,
he could rage and storm, but he could do nothing. He has only one
God&mdash;what he calls his position. Sir Rupert could have taken
that from him with a word. He could have thrown him
down&mdash;stripped him of every&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Godfrey Mackenzie is a rich man?"</p>

<p>"A rich man!" The woman laughed scornfully. "Sir Rupert was
the rich man. He owned them&mdash;Carriday, Ibbotson and Godfrey.
They had to do what he told them. I did because&mdash;because I
loved him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackenzie caught you and Sir Rupert in a compromising
situation, you say. Did they quarrel? Where did this take
place?"</p>

<p>"At the cottage."</p>

<p>"The cottage. Where is the cottage?"</p>

<p>"About a mile from here. It used to be the gardener's cottage,
but Sir Rupert built another, nearer the house, and left this one
empty. He suggested&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That it would be a convenient and secret place for you and he
to meet at?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie." The detective spoke after some moment's
silence. "You have been very frank with me. You have confessed an
intimacy existed between you and Sir Rupert&mdash;when there was
no occasion tor such a confession. I admit I cannot understand
your reasons for that confession, but I will promise I will not
use it unless it is imperative in bringing Sir Rupert's murderer
to justice."</p>

<p>"His murderer to justice!" Although her tones were so low that
Williams hardly caught the words, the malice in her voice made a
cold shiver run down his spine. "Yes, his murderer to justice. I
would sacrifice my life, and more, for that."</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim!"</p>

<p>Williams swung round to face the window. A moment later and
Bobby Trayne dashed into the room.</p>

<p>"Jim! Those foul friends have got her!"</p>

<p>"Who?" The detective sprang forward catching the journalist by
the shoulders and shaking him roughly. "Speak, man, who?"</p>

<p>"Myrtle!" Bobby sank into a chair, his face drawn and
haggard.</p>

<p>"I was to meet her by the sundial. When I got there I
waited&mdash;and waited&mdash;and&mdash;she did not come."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has been detained." The Inspector suggested,
hopefully.</p>

<p>"I thought that, at first." The newspaperman's tones were
hopeless. "I moved around a bit&mdash;and in one of the by-paths
I found this."</p>

<p>He held out a small bronze shoe between his two hands. For a
moment he sat staring at it, then dropped it on the table and
flinging himself in a chair, buried his face in his hands.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">"TAKE a pull at yourself, man!" The Inspector
walked across and laid a heavy hand on the newspaperman's
shoulders. "You're only guessing. How do you know that's her
shoe?"</p>

<p>"She wore it when she came down the stairs half an hour ago."
Bobby rose from his seat and shook himself, savagely. "I don't
jump to conclusions, Williams, you know that. There's something
damned fishy going on here and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned and stared at the woman seated on the opposite side
of the room. "Good Lord! Why, you're Mrs.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie has brought me some news," The Inspector
interposed. "I'll tell you about it later."</p>

<p>"No need," Bobby chuckled. The Inspector's matter of fact
manner had helped him recover, his poise. "I'll guess. Mrs.
Mackenzie came here because her husband stopped on his way to the
city to inform her of the death of Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>"Well?" The detective spoke quickly, exchanging a glance of
anxiety with the woman.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert and Godfrey Mackenzie
were&mdash;er&mdash;friends." The journalist spoke slowly,
choosing his words with care. "They were not so great friends as
Sir Rupert and Godfrey Mackenzie's wife."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Mrs. Mackenzie sprang to heir feet, her
eyes blazing with excitement. "Inspector Williams&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rather strong, that, Bobby," the detective spoke heavily.</p>

<p>"Common knowledge, Inspector," Bobby drawled. "There's a
weekly 'rag' in this town that makes a feature of that sort of
gossip."</p>

<p>Without a word Mrs. Mackenzie walked out of the room, ignoring
the journalist who sprang to open the door for her. As he closed
the door Bobby breathed deeply.</p>

<p>"Thank God for a cleaner atmosphere!" He walked to the
windows. "Now we can get to essentials."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie's story was not essential, you think," queried
the detective.</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten," Bobby spoke simply. "But, before the day had
passed I would have remembered. I knew there was something at the
back of my mind connecting Godfrey Mackenzie and Sir Rupert, as
antagonists. So you think now that Mackenzie, murdered his chief
because of his wife?"</p>

<p>"That's a reason."</p>

<p>"Is it? What of the proof?"</p>

<p>"Mackenzie knew of his wife's visit to the deserted cottage,
to meet Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>"And because of that knowledge Mackenzie takes revenge for his
sullied honour amid a roomful of people. Not good enough. Those
detective mystery stories will be your downfall, Jim."</p>

<p>"Murderers act queerly."</p>

<p>"On the contrary they're the most logical of
criminals&mdash;in point of fact they should not be classed as
criminals at all. They suffer from a primitive reversion,
piercing through a veneer of law and order, established by
centuries of theorists and prohibitionists."</p>

<p>"That doesn't help us."</p>

<p>"Except reducing our stock of non-suspects to one."</p>

<p>"If we exclude Miss Haffervale."</p>

<p>"Of course." Again the journalist moved towards the window.
"Time we got to work. Come along, Jim."</p>

<p>On the veranda he paused, suddenly. "What about the deserted
cottage you spoke of."</p>

<p>"'Bout a half-mile from here. The lady and Sir Rupert used it
for their meetings. Know it?"</p>

<p>"No. 'Course it's furnished. Would be, if I know my late
chief&mdash;in the best of style for ash-blondes. God!" He led
across the lawns at a dog trot, the Inspector following more
slowly. Bobby waited at the garden seat until the detective came
up and then moved on, watching the ground carefully.</p>

<p>"Found that shoe here," he said, abruptly. "Careful, Jim. I
was too anxious to get in touch with you to examine the place for
marks."</p>

<p>"On the path."</p>

<p>"Just off it." The newspaperman bent and indicated a patch of
earth under some standard rose-trees. "Just here! No, there's no
mark; I looked for that. It fell there, lightly&mdash;I mean. It
was not thrown down."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Myrtle was sensible when she passed here." Bobby spoke
positively. "She was sensible and was being carried by her
abductors."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she call out?"</p>

<p>"We shouldn't have heard her at the house. So far as I can see
there's no one about the grounds. Keston tells me there are three
gardeners. Where they are I can't discover."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert sent them off for the day."</p>

<p>"For the half-day," corrected the journalist. "You can't hear
Sir Rupert giving more than he had to away."</p>

<p>"The gardens, deserted&mdash;the girl abducted. That brings us
back to the three men in the garden, Bobby."</p>

<p>"Three men we've got to prove," Bobby grinned. He was
regaining his confidence. "For all we know at present, they may
be the gardeners. There's such a thing as devotion to duty,
but&mdash;" He ceased speaking suddenly, staring down towards the
edge of the cliffs. With a beckoning motion he moved on rapidly.
At the other side of a bank of ornamental trees he came on a man
digging industriously. For some moments he stood watching him,
the man not aware of his presence.</p>

<p>"Hard soil that." The newspaperman lounged forward, his hands
thrust, deeply in his trousers pockets. "You're one of the
gardeners, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Name's Martin, Sir." The man straightened his back and leaned
on the handle of his fork. "Soil's hard, as you say&mdash;mighty
hard."</p>

<p>"Been at it long?" Bobby measured with his eyes the
turned-over soil. "'Bout an hour I'd say."</p>

<p>"Rather more 'n less." The man grinned. "You've a good eye,
though, sir."</p>

<p>"That means you started about one o'clock."</p>

<p>"One o'clock it was, sir. Sir Rupert gave us the morning off.
You been from the house, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You've heard of the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The accident, sir?" The man shoved back his tattered hat and
scratched his head reflectively "Well, I heard something, just a
bit of gossip which I didn't pay much attention to."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert's dead&mdash;shot," Bobby spoke briefly. "This is
Inspector Williams, from Headquarters. It wasn't an
accident&mdash;just pure, premeditated murder. Now I want to know
it you've seen any suspicious characters about the gardens this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Did you hear anyone shouting, within the last hour, Martin?"
interposed the detective.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert, murdered," the man spoke dazedly. "No, sir. I've
heard nothing. There's been no one about, so far as I know."</p>

<p>"You're the head-gardener?" Bobby asked. "Keston said the
head-gardener was named Martin. The under-gardeners were
named&mdash;bother, I've forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Rufus and Thomas." The man supplied the names quickly.
"They're working on the other side of the house."</p>

<p>"That's away towards the old abandoned cottage." interjected
the newspaperman. "You used to live there, didn't you."</p>

<p>"Not me, sir. 'Twas Roberts, the man who was here before me
had that cottage. When he went Sir Rupert built the new cottage
on this side of the road from Bondi. The&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The other cottage is on the other side, of the road, then,"
Williams spoke.</p>

<p>"That's correct."</p>

<p>"What's happened to it&mdash;abandoned?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's shut up. I 'eard it's to let&mdash;been to let for
some considerable time."</p>

<p>"Furnished?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Maybe. I ain't never been inside. It's tight
locked up."</p>

<p>"Suppose you went to see?"</p>

<p>"I was there last week." The man hesitated. "Suppose it
doesn't matter to tell you; sir, but there was a rumour about
that lights had been seen in it. I went round thinking that
someone had found a way in&mdash;but it was tight locked up."</p>

<p>"You didn't report the rumour to Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Never thought of it, or I might have&mdash;" Martin grinned.
"When I found I couldn't get in, 'less I got the keys, I guessed
others couldn't have."</p>

<p>"Look here, Martin." Bobby spoke after a lengthy silence. "Sir
Rupert was murdered, in a most mysterious manner, while
surrounded by his guests. That's a point that concerns Inspector
Williams, not you&mdash;What I want from you is this: Who were
the three men in the grounds, between here and the house, about
noon, today?"</p>

<p>"Three men in the grounds?" The man looked amazed. "There's
been no one in the grounds, so far as I know."</p>

<p>"Then come and see." Bobby led the way, at a smart pace, back
to the sundial. Then he pointed out the various marks he and
Williams had discovered. While Martin was examining them he
managed to slide alongside the detective and caution him against
mentioning Myrtle's disappearance.</p>

<p>"None of those marks belong to you or your men?"</p>

<p>"Not mine&mdash;nor Rufus or Thomas made those footprints,"
the man answered positively, "you can take it I'm right, sir. I'd
tell the marks of any of us who stepped on a bed&mdash;aye, and
swear to them."</p>

<p>"You say your mates are working on the other side of the
house?" Bobby continued. "Between the house and the abandoned
cottage?"</p>

<p>"Depends on which way you goes, sir." Martin grinned. "If you
goes down the path from the house direct, then yes. But it you go
from here, then no. You see," he led the way along the path for a
few yards. "You're on the angle of the house here. The cottage is
over there. You wouldn't go within a hundred yards of the house
to get to it from here."</p>

<p>"Then you could get from here to the cottage without coming
in contact with your men?" questioned the newspaperman.</p>

<p>"That's so. There's plenty of shrubs and trees about. Rufus
and Thomas are working along the creek, in what we call the
Middle Hollow. They wouldn't see anything, or anyone, who didn't
go across the bridge."</p>

<p>"Good enough!" Bobby slipped his hand into his pocket. "I
don't think Sir Rupert will object to you stopping that digging,
or Rufus, and Thomas neglecting the watercourse for an hour or
two. Bring me the names or descriptions of the men who made those
footprints&mdash;the men themselves, if you can&mdash;and there's
a note for each of you. The size depends on how quick I get that
information. Understand? The Inspector and I are going to the
cottage. You'll find me there or at the house. Ask for Robert
Trayne. If I'm not there telephone the <i>Mirror</i> office. I'll
come along to you as quick as I can."</p>

<p>With a short nod he led the way up a path the gardener
indicated. A little over half a mile and they came to the main
road to Barrabarra Bay. Turning to the left he found a small gate
leading into a large plantation.</p>

<p>A hundred yards along the path, and a small cottage came into
view, the windows shuttered. There was something about the
cottage that caught the newspaperman's attention. It was
apparently unoccupied but about it hung an indefinable atmosphere
of being in occupation. Followed by the detective he skirted the
building, examining it from all sides.</p>

<p>"Don't like it, Jim," he muttered, as they turned, the fourth
corner, coming back to the front door. "In spite of the shutters,
and the general air of neglect that place is being lived in."</p>

<p>"Forgotten the tale of Sir Rupert and the lady?" Williams
grinned.</p>

<p>"Forgotten nothing!" The journalist moved towards the door.
Suddenly he stopped and pointed to a patch of soft earth. "Lord,
what a fool that man is. There's his trade mark again."</p>

<p>On the soft earth was outlined the pattern of a large boot.
Bobby bent to examine, it. A short survey and he straightened
himself. There could be no possible doubt. The marks patterned
exactly the one he had found by the sundial.</p>

<p>What had the man been doing at the door of a cottage supposed
to be deserted? What had he been doing in the grounds of
Madlands, during the time the conference had been assembled in
the dining-room? With a shrug of his shoulders the newspaper-man
went to the door of the cottage and knocked.</p>

<p>"Expect an answer, Bobby?" The detective had been watching the
journalist with a smile of amusement on his lips.</p>

<p>"Just politeness, Jim," The newspaperman ripped open his
waistcoat and from under his shirt drew a soft leather belt.</p>

<p>"Crook's etiquette, if you want to know. They always knock
before entering."</p>

<p>From the belt he drew a queer looking instrument, somewhat
resembling a bent key. A few turns in the look of the door, and
the wards gave. With a shove of his shoulders Bobby sent the door
open, and motioned the detective to enter.</p>

<p>"The complete journalist-crook," Williams spoke regretfully.
"I should arrest you for having those things in your possession,
Bobby. As it is, you're too useful at present and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even an Australian detective may enter the door of a deserted
cottage, if he finds it open." Bobby waved ceremoniously towards
the door. "Official precedence, Inspector."</p>

<p>But Bobby was too impatient to wait for Williams' slow
deliberate movements. In the little hall he pushed past him and
flung open the door to the right of the entrance. It led into a
well furnished dining-room, the table laid with the remains of a
meal.</p>

<p>"The love-nest!" Bobby spoke with disgust as he noted the
various signs of female occupation. "Mrs. Mackenzie made herself
at home, certainly. What beasts some of our leading citizens
are."</p>

<p>"They're not alone in that, Bobby." Williams spoke in slow
deep tones. "At headquarters I've heard tales of the proletariat
that would make a blush rise to your hardened cheeks.
But&mdash;Come on, Let's have a look at the other rooms. There's
nothing here."</p>

<p>He crossed, the small hall and flung open the opposite door.
As he hesitated on the threshold Bobby sprang past him with a
shout of amazement. Just within the door lay the fellow to the
shoe he had found by the sundial.</p>

<p>"God! Is she here?" He strode in to the room; to halt with a
cry of alarm. On the ornate bed lay the form of a woman, covered
with a light wrap. For a moment the journalist stared, his cheeks
blanched. He rocked on his feet, and would have fallen, but for
the detective's hand.</p>

<p>"Steady, Bobby."</p>

<p>Williams helped the young man to a chair and forced him into
it. He turned, and after a moment's hesitation, crossed to the
bed. For some time be stood looking down on the shrouded figure.
Had the young brilliant girl he had spoken to in the hall at
Madlands come to this? Could there be any doubt? She had been
forcibly taken from the grounds, while waiting for Bobby Trayne
to come to her. They had found her shoe at the door of the
room.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;With a sudden movement he drew the wrap from the
silent form. His cry brought Bobby to his side.</p>

<p>In silence the two men stared down on the white face of Alice
Mackenzie.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">"ALICE MACKENZIE!" Bobby breathed the words,
with almost a sigh of relief. Pushing the Inspector to one side
he bent over the body. A moment, and he straightened himself,
pointing to a bullet wound in the chest. "Went the same way as
Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>"And by the same hand." The detective's large hand, strangely
gentle, passed over the bare shoulders. "Still warm. Of course,
we saw her within the past hour."</p>

<p>"Came straight here from Madlands," Bobby nodded. "The
murderer was lying in wait, and shot her down. Where?"</p>

<p>He turned to face the room. "Not here. Jim, have a look round.
I want the place where she fell. Look at her dress&mdash;her
attitude as she was carried here; there's no doubt of that."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" For a moment a gleam of suspicion
lit the detective's eyes. "What are you looking for?"</p>

<p>"Telephone."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert wasn't a piker. There's a telephone
here&mdash;hidden behind one of those contraptions women love to
have about."</p>

<p>A quick search of the room and Bobby went to the door. In the
dining-room he found the telephone and called a city number.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Bobby?" The Inspector loomed at the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Eliminating possibilities." The journalist held up his hand
for silence. "Yes. Mr. Mackenzie&mdash;Mr. Godfrey Mackenzie in
his office? Yes, I would like to speak to him. Who? Robert Trayne
of the <i>Mirror</i>. Hold the line! All right." There was a long
silence. "What's that? Tell Mr. Mackenzie I want to speak to him.
Engaged. Well, tell him it's a police matter and unless I get him
on the phone within the next few seconds he will find the
Headquarters' Police at his office."</p>

<p>"Here! Steady, Bobby." Williams protested</p>

<p>"I will!" The newspaperman covered the receiver with his hand
and turned to the detective. "Let those people delay in getting
me on to Godfrey Mackenzie and I'll ring up Police Headquarters
and lay an information against him, pronto. "Wait!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackenzie? Bobby Trayne speaking. I heard you went home
from Madlands and informed your wife of Sir Rupert's death.
What's that to do with me? I'll tell you. Mrs. Mackenzie has gone
the same way as Sir Rupert. Get me? What? I'm telling
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold hard, Trayne." The Inspector's voice was harsh and
dominant. "That's brutal!"</p>

<p>"You know the abandoned gardener's cottage on the Madlands
estate? Get in your car and go there. Quick! Yes, Inspector
Williams and I are here. We're waiting for you."</p>

<p>In sudden anger the journalist flung the earpiece on the hook
and turned to the Inspector, his face blazing with anger.</p>

<p>"You heard? I repeated his words so that you should
understand. You accuse me of being hard. What of it? What of the
woman in the next room? Is it hard on her? What of Myrtle, in the
power&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not accusing Mackenzie of the abduction of the
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You accused him just now of the murder of his wife," Bobby
flung round, in sudden temper. "I want to know what all this
means. Why was Alice Mackenzie shot, within a few hours of her
lover's death? I want to know the reason for the abduction of
Myrtle."</p>

<p>"Are you certain the girl was abducted?" asked the detective
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Ignoring the evidence of the two shoes?" Bobby laughed
harshly. "Girls wander through gardens kicking off shoes now and
then, and forgetting to retrieve them! They wander across main
roads with one high-heeled shoe on and the other lying,
neglected, a mile away. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the good of getting hot, Bobby?" Williams spoke
quietly. "I'm granting something strange has happened, but we
don't know what, yet."</p>

<p>"The body of that woman, lying on the bed in the next room,"
Bobby, laughed harshly. "You saw, the blood has hardly stained
the linen. There's no blood on the floor, or the couch. There's
no sign of a conflict in the room. Can you read the riddle?"</p>

<p>The detective shook his head.</p>

<p>"Look around this room," continued the journalist. "The table
set for two. Feel this slice of bread: it is not a dozen hours
old. Look at the china and glass. There's hardly a trace of dust
on it. The table linen has not yet had time to lose the ridges of
its folds."</p>

<p>For some minutes the journalist paced the room, frowning
thoughtfully. His sudden temper, born of anxiety, wore itself out
and, at length, he turned to the detective, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Jim; sorry I let myself get out of hand. But the air's
got me set. Let's reconstruct what happened, so far as possible.
Start from last night. There's evidence that Sir Rupert and his
lady love had an assignment here&mdash;and kept it."</p>

<p>Williams nodded.</p>

<p>"Now, who set that table? You've seen that lady&mdash;do you
think she was capable of that? I don't&mdash;I reckon there
wouldn't be much beauty about the table that Sir Rupert laid.
Then there's someone in the confidence of the pair of lovers, who
is that person? She can tell us a lot."</p>

<p>"She?"</p>

<p>"Accusing Keston, the butler? No. Sir Rupert wouldn't trust
him in that matter. Let me proceed. Sir Rupert and Alice
Mackenzie kept an assignation here last night. You noted that the
bed had been used&mdash;not merely flung open to lay in the dead
woman. Sir Rupert goes to Madlands, to prepare for the ceremony
of his niece's coming of age. There was to be great doings at
Madlands tonight you know. They're off&mdash;poor girl!"</p>

<p>He rose from the chair in which he had been sitting and strode
up and down the room, continuing.</p>

<p>"Something happened last night to put the fear of God into Sir
Rupert's heart. He rings up Alan Reeves, the <i>Mirror</i>'s
chief of staff at some unearthly hour this morning. I know that,
for I got my instructions by telephone for this day, just after
eight o'clock. From what Reeves said I gathered he had only just
received his."</p>

<p>"That's news, Bobby."</p>

<p>"I know. I'd only just compared times, in my mind. We'll go
on. I come to Madlands and find Sir Rupert in a deadly funk. Why?
Had anything happened during the night giving him reason to fear
for his life? I say, 'yes,' and I say that woman in the next room
gave him the information that set in train the series of events
culminating in her death."</p>

<p>"You're ignoring a lot," interjected the Inspector.</p>

<p>"More than I'm adding together!" The journalist acknowledged.
"There's the watch on the table. By the way, if I am correct in
suggesting that Mrs. Mackenzie gave Sir Rupert information that
fluffed him, then the rundown watch is explainable. There's the
gun that killed Sir Rupert. That has to be found."</p>

<p>"The same gun that killed Mrs. Mackenzie."</p>

<p>"I'll stake a year's income that it is not," Bobby retorted
quickly. "We're not dealing with a fool, Jim, and until we lay
hands on him there's not a hope of getting it. One of the men who
entered the dining-room while we were out in the grounds
retrieved it."</p>

<p>"Where was it hidden?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easy. Jim, did you notice anything queer
about my conversation with Godfrey Mackenzie. I mean his
words."</p>

<p>"He said little&mdash;you didn't give him a chance to say
much."</p>

<p>"It wasn't what he said&mdash;but what he forgot to say."
Bobby spoke significantly. "I told him to come to the abandoned
gardener's cottage. He didn't ask for directions. He didn't ask
how his wife died. But we'll get on to that when he turns up
here. At present, I want to know where Alice Mackenzie met her
death."</p>

<p>He led from the room to the open air. For some moments he
stood gazing down on the large footstep pointing to the door of
the cottage.</p>

<p>"If that mark could only speak, what could it tell of the
happening of the night and day?" With a shrug of his shoulders he
moved on, again circling the cottage. As he came near the back
door of the cottage it opened and the detective beckoned to
him.</p>

<p>"There's a queer litter in the kitchen, Bobby," Williams voice
was low. "Looks as if your theory of the warning was right for
there's been evident preparations for the abandonment of the
place. Then, there's this."</p>

<p>He held out an envelope. Bobby almost snatched it. The
enclosed paper was covered with a large scrawling writing; and
containing but few words, unsigned. A glance and the newspaperman
had mastered the contents.</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Alice</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">I won't share you with anyone. Rita has told me
of this cottage&mdash;and the use you make of it. You must send
him away or&mdash;"</p>

<p><br> "Or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The journalist looked up into the detective's face with a
quizzical grin.</p>

<p>"Seems like the lady was free with her favours."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert had evidently found out something," added
Williams.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert?" Bobby looked his astonishment. "That's not Sir
Rupert's writing."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll guess in one." Bobby twisted the envelope in his
fingers. "Lord Carriday."</p>

<p>"Guess?"</p>

<p>"No. Certainty. One of the social writers at the <i>Mirror</i>
was gossiping with a mate. I overheard. The inference was that
Alice Maude had transferred her attentions from the knight to the
lord. The lady appears not to have made any secret of her amours.
At one time she was seen about, freely, with Sir Rupert; of late
her cavalier has been Carriday."</p>

<p>"Engaged to be married to Myrtle Haffervale! Good Lor'!"</p>

<p>A flash of anger illuminated the newspaperman's eyes. He
glanced down so that the detective should not witness his
emotion. A sudden amazement came on his face.</p>

<p>"Jim! Look at this." He held up the back of the envelope. In
dark outline on the white paper was the imprint of a woman's shoe
heel.</p>

<p>"Slipped under the door of the cottage." Williams
reconstructed. "Mrs. Mackenzie enters the cottage and treads,
accidentally, on the envelope. She tears it open and reads it,
then carries it into the kitchen&mdash;and forgets it."</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>"On the floor. Had evidently been knocked off the table. Come
in here and tell me what you make of this."</p>

<p>Williams stepped back into the kitchen. Bobby followed him.
The place was in confusion, papers littering the ground on every
side. Bobby took one glance at the litter, then stepped to the
back door and looked it.</p>

<p>"Come out of here, man. There's work for a full day here and
we haven't time now. Mackenzie will be here any minute and we'll
have to give him all our attention."</p>

<p>As he spoke the sound of a motor horn came from the road.
Williams made to go to the front door, but Bobby held him
back.</p>

<p>"Let the blighter find his own way here," he said in a low
tone. "When I 'phoned him he didn't ask for directions how to
find the cottage. I want to watch him. When he comes in, show him
where his wife lies and then get out of the cottage and join me.
I'll watch for you."</p>

<p>Treading lightly, Bobby ran out of the cottage and
disappeared. Williams shut the door and went to the dining-room,
grinning largely. Bobby on the trail was a sheer delight.</p>

<p>Well grounded in criminology, the journalist had an uncanny
instinct that led him to conclusions over obstacles that
frequently baffled the detective. A knock came at the door of the
cottage. Williams leisurely answered the door, admitting Godfrey
Mackenzie. The financier showed little emotion on his face. He
greeted the detective briefly and followed him to the bedroom.
For some seconds the detective stood in the doorway watching the
man, then closed the door and made his way to the grounds. A
moment and Bobby was by his side, his face alight with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Jim, I've foozled it. That boot mark&mdash;the 10&mdash;was
not made today. It's been there all night. Have a look at
this."</p>

<p>Quite openly he led to where he had found the strange boot
mark. Warning the detective to consider it carefully he strolled
on. When Williams raised himself from his examination, Bobby
beckoned him to where he stood. On a patch of fine earth lay a
facsimile of the first boot-mark.</p>

<p>"Godfrey Mackenzie's," the journalist whispered. "They're
exact. Now, look at this."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket the soiled envelope and handed it to
the detective. The mark of the girl's heel was now defined in
pencil outline. From his pocket Bobby brought out the shoe he had
found within the cottage bedroom door. The shoe fitted the marked
envelope, exactly.</p>

<p>"Myrtle Haffervale's shoe!" The detective gasped his surprise.
"What was she doing in the cottage last night&mdash;when her
uncle and his mistress were there."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">BOBBY turned and walked down the narrow path to
the gate opening on to the main road. He wanted to be alone, to
think; to try and co-ordinate the facts he had gathered into a
connected, intelligible story.</p>

<p>He had watched Myrtle descend the stairs at Madlands, wearing
shoes exactly similar to the one he held in his hand. He was
certain he had made no mistake&mdash;that the shoe he had found
in the cottage belonged to her. She had bidden him come to her in
the garden by the sundial, in half an hour. He had kept the
appointment&mdash;to find her missing. Time passed and his
anxiety had increased. He had searched&mdash;to find one of her
shoes in the flower-bed.</p>

<p>How had the shoe come there? He could find but one possible
answer. The girl had been attacked and forcibly abducted; in the
struggle her shoe had fallen off. Her captors had not noticed the
loss of the shoe; it had lain on the flower-bed until he had
discovered it.</p>

<p>He had now to explain the shoe found in the cottage. He must
follow out his theory. The abductions had taken the girl to the
cottage. One of them had held the girl in his arms, while the
other had opened the door. It was then she had trodden on the
envelope. A few paces inside the cottage and she had kicked off
her remaining shoe, finding it easier to walk in stockinged feet
than to limp on a single high-heel.</p>

<p>But that theory would destroy his reconstruction of the
circumstances surrounding the letter from Carriday to Alice
Mackenzie. He had theorised that the letter had been slipped
under the cottage door the previous evening and that the woman
had found it there when she arrived to keep her assignation with
Sir Rupert. That theory would postulate that Myrtle had come to
the cottage immediately before the arrival of Sir Rupert and his
mistress.</p>

<p>The idea was inconceivable! What had the girl to do with the
sordid intrigue between the knight and Alice Mackenzie? More,
Myrtle had been wearing those shoes that morning. His finding one
of the shoes under the rose-bushes proved that.</p>

<p>No! Myrtle had been abducted from the grounds of Madlands that
morning. She had kicked off one shoe in the first struggle; the
other when forced into the cottage.</p>

<p>If his reasoning was incorrect, how had the imprint of her
heel come on the back of the envelope? Had Alice Mackenzie
received the letter the previous evening or that morning?
Williams had found the letter on the kitchen floor. If was
possible that Myrtle might have trodden on it while it lay there.
In that case why had she wandered through the rooms of the
cottage on one high heel; to discard the shoe just within the
bedroom door? If the girl had been brought to the cottage under
duress would her captors have allowed her to roam the place?
Neither supposition fitted the facts.</p>

<p>One thing was incontestable. Myrtle had been captured and
taken to the cottage before Alice Mackenzie had left Madlands.
Both he and Williams could swear to that. The woman had gone from
the house to the cottage, presumably to remove traces of her
presence. She had found Myrtle and her captors at the cottage.
The men shot her, placed her body on the bed and fled, taking
Myrtle with them.</p>

<p>Who were the men? Immediately to the newspaperman's alert
brain sprang the word Carriday! The meat baron knew of the
cottage&mdash;the letter to Alice Mackenzie tended to show that
she had used the place for her meetings with him. Carriday had
abducted Myrtle, taking her to the cottage, believing it to be
the most secure hiding place for the moment. Alice had come upon
him and the girl; there had been a severe quarrel, resulting in
the woman's death.</p>

<p>But why had Carriday abducted Myrtle? He had displayed no
anxiety regarding the girl until after Sir Rupert's death. Yet he
had been officially engaged to her. The man had a reputation for
gallantry&mdash;with women more matured and sophisticated. A
young girl would have few attractions for him.</p>

<p>Myrtle was an heiress: one of the wealthiest young women in
the world. But Carriday was reputed enormously rich. Was his
wealth a myth? Mackenzie and Ibbotson were reputed millionaires.
Gerald Preston had laughed at their claims, declaring them
dummies for the eccentric millionaire, the late Matthew
Haffervale. Did the British peer come in the same category?</p>

<p>A sudden sound from the direction of the cottage caused Bobby
to swing round, abruptly. Godfrey Mackenzie was standing in th
cottage door. Inspector Williams advancing to meet him. Bobby
strode back to the cottage. He wanted to hear every word the
chain-store magnate uttered.</p>

<p>"Who found&mdash;her?" Mackenzie spoke without emotion and
with a perceptible pause before the last word.</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams," the newspaperman responded briefly.</p>

<p>"What was she doing here?"</p>

<p>"We don't know." Bobby flashed a warning glance at the
detective. "We heard of the abandoned gardener's cottage and came
to examine it. Then we found&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her." The chain-store magnate nodded. "Who shot her?"</p>

<p>"There was no one in the place when we arrived," said the
newspaperman.</p>

<p>"That means you're not handing out information." A wisp of a
smile came on the thin lips. For a moment the man was silent.
Suddenly he looked Bobby straight in the face. "You know she's
been here before?"</p>

<p>"And that you knew of her visits, here." The newspaperman shot
back. "Why did you drive home on your way to the city and inform
your wife that Sir Rupert was dead?"</p>

<p>"You know that?" The man did not flinch. "Well, I did. I
wanted to see how she would react to the news. If you want to
know, she's not been a wife to me for quite a while&mdash;just a
psychological study."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Steady Bobby," Williams spoke. "The woman's dead."</p>

<p>"Her lovers, you mean," Mackenzie laughed shortly. "Oh, you
needn't be mealy-mouthed, Inspector. I've known a lot, and for
quite a time."</p>

<p>"You knew she came here to meet Sir Rupert Haffervale, last
night." For the first time the detective took a hand in the
examination.</p>

<p>"I followed her&mdash;to the door. She told me she was playing
bridge at the club."</p>

<p>"You followed her here." Williams gasped. "What did you do
when she entered the cottage?"</p>

<p>"Was Sir Rupert here when she arrived?" amended Bobby.</p>

<p>"She opened the door with a latchkey." Mackenzie spoke
impersonally. "What did I do when the door closed on her? I went
home and went to bed."</p>

<p>"Leaving your wife alone in a deserted cottage with another
man?" The Inspector gasped.</p>

<p>"What good would it have done me to storm the cottage and
raise hell?" A wolfish snarl distorted the financier's lips.
"Besides, she hasn't been my wife for quite a time. I had
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stand on one side&mdash;to save your position," Bobby
completed, brutally. "If you had interfered Sir Rupert would
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He would." Mackenzie interjected, almost too quickly.</p>

<p>"Yet you took the trouble to drive out of your way to tell her
Sir Rupert had been shot," asked the Inspector. "Why?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You knew Sir Rupert was not&mdash;not the only man
concerned." With sudden impulse Bobby pulled from his pocket the
envelope bearing Myrtle's heel mark and took out the unsigned
paper.</p>

<p>"Do you know that writing?"</p>

<p>Godfrey Mackenzie accepted, the paper with steady hand,
reading the message on it, quickly. A slight smile broke the line
of his compressed lips.</p>

<p>"Carriday! That's old." He tossed the paper back to the
journalist, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Before Sir Rupert's time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sir Rupert was my lady's latest caprice."</p>

<p>"Godfrey Mackenzie, who killed Sir Rupert Haffervale?" Bobby
spoke hastily.</p>

<p>"If anyone&mdash;you." The man's beetling brews drew together
in a harsh line.</p>

<p>"My pistol was not covered with a silencer. Besides the bullet
was of a different calibre." Unthinkingly, Bobby, defended
himself. "Can you make a better guess?"</p>

<p>"There were eight of us in the room." Mackenzie shrugged his
shoulders. "That's the problem for Inspector Williams&mdash;not
me. Can I take her away?" He nodded towards the bedroom.</p>

<p>"It you want to." Inspector Williams moved into the cottage.
"I'll ring the ambulance."</p>

<p>"No." Mackenzie spoke hastily. "I'll get some men to carry her
home. It's not far&mdash;a bare half mile. I don't want the
ambulance around here while she's&mdash;" He hesitated, ceasing
to speak, with a weak gesture.</p>

<p>"There are Madlands gardeners working in the gully on the
opposite side of the road; but we'll want a stretcher." Bobby
experienced a sudden sympathy for the financier. He turned at the
sound of a motor-car coming to halt before the gate on the road.
"I'll get them."</p>

<p>"There's a loose door to the shed behind the cottage." The
Inspector volunteered. Then as he caught the newspaperman's eye
he added. "I'll get it free while Mr. Trayne gets the men. They
can carry her on it."</p>

<p>The Inspector Stepped down on the path. Bobby advanced to meet
him. A few words in a low tone and the detective disappeared
around the corner of the house. The newspaperman watched a few
moments, then walked down the path towards the gate. Watching
over his shoulder until the chain-store magnate's attention was
diverted from him, Bobby slid into the bush beside the path. Out
of sight he stole silently in the direction of the cottage,
finding a position from where he could hear and see everything
that happened at the door.</p>

<p>He had only been in position a few seconds when Adam Ibbotson
strode up the path to the cottage. Mackenzie watched him approach
with sombre eyes. Ibbotson held out his hand, but it was some
moments before Mackenzie grasped it.</p>

<p>"Heard of your loss, in town, old man." There was perceptible
nervousness in the tobacco-man's voice. "Came out here at once to
know if I could do anything for you."</p>

<p>"Heard of my loss in town?" Mackenzie spoke with sudden
suspicion. "Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Just heard it." Ibbotson laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>"Or read it in the papers?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen the afternoon papers yet. No, I heard it from
some man."</p>

<p>"A man in my offices." Sudden anger blazed in the chain-store
magnate's voice. "That's got to stop, Ibbotson. I've heard enough
of it. Three times during the last twelve months I've had to
dismiss men for taking information from my office to you. I tell,
you, for the last time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Threatening me?" The big man laughed, harshly. "Don't forget
you threatened Haffervale&mdash;and you know what happened to
him. I'm not going the same road to please you. There's an
Inspector of police about here. One more word from you and
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Mackenzie laughed contemptuously. "You forget. You
threatened Haffervale also. He told, me that&mdash;but there, I'm
not bandying words with you, and my wife lying dead in this hut.
Sorry you've had all the trouble of bringing your sympathy out
here, where it's not appreciated. Good day&mdash;and to the devil
with you and your sympathy."</p>

<p>The chain-store magnate turned on his heels and entered the
cottage, closing the door violently behind him. Ibbotson stood
undecided for some moments, then swung round and walked back to
the gate. He stood for some time leaning on the post, watching
the road. Bobby was puzzled. What was the man waiting for? He
drew back into the undergrowth and commenced to circle towards
the road. He had proceeded less than twenty yards when some sound
attracted his attention. For a moment he hesitated, then went
forwards again towards the cottage, taking the precautions to
make no sound. Under a low branched tree a man was stationed,
watching the front of the cottage. Bobby waited a few moments,
then stole forward until he was but half a dozen yards from the
man. Then he straightened and walked heavily forward.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Carruthers!" The newspaperman spoke
ironically. "Still with a strong devotion to duty?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trayne!" The man gasped with surprise.</p>

<p>"The same." Again the newspaperman laughed. "By the way, Mr.
Carruthers, you might inform me what reason you had for being in
the grounds at Madlands this morning between eleven-thirty and
half-past twelve&mdash;and did you leave then."</p>

<p>The private detective stared at Bobby amazingly. "I never saw
you there."</p>

<p>"I was not there&mdash;I preferred the inside of the house,
where, things were happening." A broad grin came on the
newspaperman's features. "Won't tell me? Then I must guess. Shall
I say our mutual friend, Adam Ibbotson, required protection when
he visited his friend and patron, Sir Rupert Haffervale. That the
same friend picked you up this evening, when he decided to visit
Godfrey Mackenzie, here. Friend Ibbotson wants a lot of
protection, doesn't he? Now, Carruthers, who were other men in
the grounds of Madlands, this morning? No good saying you don't
know, for you spent quite a time in dodging them."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know." The private detective stared at Bobby
in amazement for some moments; then inconsistently ran through
the bush in the direction of the road.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">MR. TRAYNE, where are the Bralley mortgages?"
Mark Parsons stared sombrely across his desk at the newspaperman.
"Yesterday afternoon you remarked that I should not find them
among Sir Rupert's papers, at Madlands. What was your reason for
that statement?"</p>

<p>"I happen to be aware that Sir Rupert did not take the
mortgages home with him," Bobby answered shortly.</p>

<p>"You know where they are?" The solicitor leaned forward,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I might guess. I cannot claim to have definite
knowledge."</p>

<p>Some minutes passed before the lawyer spoke again. He leaned
back in his chair biting the end of the long penholder he had
held throughout the interview. Bobby fidgeted in his chair.
Parsons was seated with his back to the window, his face in deep
shadow. There was a nervousness in his manner that intrigued, yet
irritated the newspaperman. If he would turn&mdash;if he would
reveal his face in the full light for one moment&mdash;the
journalist felt he would be better able to play his part.</p>

<p>"If my memory is correct," The solicitor spoke slowly. "You
were in Sir Rupert's office at the <i>Mirror</i> when the
documents were signed. I believe Sir Rupert asked you to witness
his signature."</p>

<p>"Your memory serves you well, Mr. Parsons." Bobby smiled.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert would not allow me to keep the papers. I believe
you remained with Sir Rupert after I left. Did he refer to the
mortgages again?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert asked me to take them to the clerk of the
<i>Mirror</i>'s strongroom&mdash;with other papers he handed
me."</p>

<p>"Strange." Again the solicitor was silent. "I presume you
carried out Sir Rupert's instructions?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The papers are not in the <i>Mirror</i>'s strong-room." The
lawyer spoke eagerly. "I had the place searched this morning.
<i>If</i> you took them there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>If</i>, Mr. Parsons!" Bobby sat upright.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon." Parsons hesitated. "I accept your
statement that you took the papers to the strongroom. But they
are not there now. Have you any knowledge of them?"</p>

<p>"I have given you my information." Bobby rose to his feet with
a slight sigh. "Is that all you wanted me for, Mr. Parsons?"</p>

<p>"Sit down." For the first time during the interview the
solicitor shifted his seat and, for the moment, Bobby caught a
clear sight of his face. "Do you realise that the recovery of the
Bralley mortgages are of great importance to the Haffervale
estate?"</p>

<p>"I believe the paramount duty at the moment to be the location
of the missing heiress, Myrtle Haffervale," Bobby answered with
warmth.</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale is quite well&mdash;and happy."</p>

<p>The journalist noticed the slight pause before the last two
words. "She is a young girl and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You infer you know where Miss Haffervale is?" Bobby could not
help showing his surprise. "The&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to add." Again a cold tone crept into the
lawyer's words. "You seem very concerned about Miss Haffervale,
Mr. Trayne."</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale made an appointment to meet me in the
Madlands grounds. She did not keep that appointment. Certain
facts discovered by Inspector Williams and myself induced the
conclusion that she had been abducted."</p>

<p>"Does Inspector Williams share your belief that Miss
Haffervale had been abducted?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He did not express himself to me in that manner this
morning." The solicitor laughed shortly. "He seemed rather amused
at your evident concern regarding the absence from her home of a
young lady who is, I believe, a stranger to you."</p>

<p>Bobby flushed hotly, then cursed under his breath. What had
Williams said to the lawyer? He had not seen the detective that
day; but late the previous night Williams had expressed the
opinion that when Myrtle Haffervale was traced down&mdash;when
she told the story of her abduction&mdash;they would be far on
the road to the solutions of the murders.</p>

<p>"You knew Mrs. McKenzie, Mr. Parsons?" Bobby said
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Very well. She and her husband are clients of my firm. I
handle most of their business, personally."</p>

<p>"You knew of the&mdash;er&mdash;understanding between Mrs.
Mackenzie and Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>"That is rather an indiscreet question, Mr. Trayne." The
solicitor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Would I be indiscreet if I asked if you can explain who fired
the shot that killed Sir Rupert?" Bobby flashed back the
question.</p>

<p>"The conclusions drawn by the doctor who saw Sir Rupert
immediately after his death appear to indicate that the shot was
fired from the other end of the table. It that theory is correct,
you, Mr. Robert Trayne, Mr. Rupert Preston and Lord Carriday must
be under suspicion. Of the three you were the only one to carry a
gun."</p>

<p>"Gerald, Lord Carriday and myself," Bobby laughed. He rose to
his feet and crossed to one of windows, close beside the
solicitor's chair. Instinctively the man swung his chair to
continue to face the journalist. Now Bobby caught a fair
full-light view of his features. His face was drawn and haggard,
the eyes bloodshot, a dull dirty yellow colour showing under the
drawn skin. "Lord Carriday was engaged to be married to Miss
Haffervale. Do you think he&mdash;er&mdash;anticipated the
wedding?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Parsons sprang to his feet. "Do you accuse
Lord Carriday of abducting Miss Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"A few seconds ago you informed me that Miss Haffervale had
not been abducted." Bobby turned abruptly. "Lord Carriday is
engaged to Miss Haffervale. He might have thought it wise to
remove her from the troubles at Madlands. An immediate marriage,
by special license, is not without the bounds of
possibility."</p>

<p>"You forget," Parsons spoke harshly, "Miss Haffervale is a
minor, subject to the rule of her trustees. Their permission to
the marriage would be required."</p>

<p>"I am afraid love forgets trustees, settlements and
permissions," Bobby hated to utter the words, but he must get the
girl's track. Parsons had inferred he had knowledge of where she
was. If possible, he must be made to speak.</p>

<p>"Lord Carriday is not engaged to Miss Haffervale." The
solicitor turned towards his desk. "Sir Rupert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Bobby questioned, as the lawyer paused.</p>

<p>"You may all well know." Parsons passed his hand wearily,
across his eyes. "Sir Rupert was a domineering man. He published
the engagement of his niece to Lord Carriday without her
knowledge or consent. Miss Haffervale protested&mdash;I was with
Sir Rupert at the time. She said nothing on earth would induce
her to marry Lord Carriday. Sir Rupert was angry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For what reason." Bobby interjected. "Lord Carriday is a rich
man&mdash;but, of course, wealth would not count with the
Haffervales. There are stories&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale would know nothing of them." Parsons spoke
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Would she not?" Bobby laughed. In a few graphic words he told
of finding Myrtle's shoe at the abandoned gardener's cottage. He
told his story in a manner that suggested Myrtle had been there
about the time Sir Rupert and Mrs. Mackenzie met there.</p>

<p>"But that is impossible." The solicitor stared at the
journalist in blank amazement. "Sir Rupert was with me all that
evening. We had matters to discuss&mdash;affairs to arrange that
kept us together far into the night. Sir Rupert slept at his
club. He left me after a final drink and I watched him go
upstairs to his bedroom."</p>

<p>"What?" The newspaperman caught Parsons by the shoulder
swinging him around, peering closely into his face. "Is that
true, Parsons?"</p>

<p>"Why should I lie?" The lawyer released his shoulder from the
journalist's grip, which had tightened painfully. "I can swear
Sir Rupert did not go to Madlands the night before last. In fact,
I called for him at his club the next morning, after breakfast,
and we drove out together."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert in town that night!" Facts were ordering
themselves in the journalist's brain. "Tell me, Parsons, why did
Myrtle tell Sir Rupert she would not marry Lord Carriday?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert had had the engagement announced in that morning's
<i>Mirror</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes? Get on! I showed the paragraph to Williams a bare hour
after Sir Rupert was killed."</p>

<p>"That paragraph was the first intimation Miss Haffervale had
of the arrangement between Lord Carriday and Sir Rupert. When we
arrived at Madlands on the morning of her birthday she followed
Sir Rupert and I into the library and asked than an immediate
contradiction be published."</p>

<p>"How did Sir Rupert take Miss Haffervale's protest?"</p>

<p>"Better than I expected." The solicitor smiled slightly. "I
had walked to the other end of the library so heard but scraps of
the conversation. From what I heard I gathered that Sir Rupert
considered he had been informed by Lord Carriday that the
marriage had been arranged."</p>

<p>"And Myr&mdash;Miss Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"I heard her reply, distinctly. She said; 'I would not marry
Lord Carriday if he was the last man on earth; He is&mdash;' Then
Sir Rupert said something that caused her to lower her voice and
I did not hear the completion of the sentence."</p>

<p>Bobby paced the office in tense agitation. He could complete
the sentence the solicitor had not heard. Now he know what Myrtle
Haffervale had wished to tell him in the grounds at Madlands. At
last he had a clue that promised to lead him to the heart of the
mystery.</p>

<p>Sir Rupert had been in town the night preceding Myrtle's
birthday. Then he had not been at the cottage with Alice
Mackenzie. But, the woman had been at the cottage&mdash;she had
acknowledged that to Inspector Williams. Who had been her
companion?</p>

<p>Again Bobby's thoughts reverted to the scrap of letter the
Inspector had found in the cottage kitchen. He was certain it had
not been written by Sir Rupert. He had thought it had come from
Lord Carriday. Had he been mistaken? It so, in what manner? Alice
Mackenzie had been at the cottage the night before Sir Rupert's
murder. What had she gone there for? Who had been her companion?
It was inconceivable that she had been there alone.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bobby halted in his abrupt pacing of the lawyer's
office. Heavy, agitated steps sounded in the passage. A hoarse,
strong voice rose in muttered rumbles over the expostulatory
tones of a woman. The door was flung violently open and Adam
Ibbotson strode into the room.</p>

<p>"Good God, Mark, what does it all mean? My man tells me that
Myrtle has disappeared."</p>

<p>"It's true." For the moment Parsons forgot the newspaperman,
partially concealed by the shadows. "I saw Inspector Williams
this morning and he told me that Miss Haffervale went into the
ground to meet that fellow Tray&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, remembering Bobby was in the room. His eyes
sought the shadows where the newspaperman stood. Ibbotson, who
was watching the lawyer intently, looked round. He strode forward
until he stood before the journalist.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Always sneaking and prying about! Is
that what the <i>Mirror</i> pays you for?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trayne came at my request." Parsons spoke quickly, rising
from his chair and coming to where Ibbotson stood. "I wanted some
information from him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which you didn't get, I'll be bound." The big man laughed
gratingly. He swung round on Bobby he face alight with anger.</p>

<p>"Well you can get out of here, as quick as you damned well
please, and you needn't go back to the <i>Mirror</i>. You're
sacked&mdash;d' yer hear me? Sacked, and I'll take damned good
care you don't get another job in this blasted city."</p>

<p>For a moment the journalist stared blankly at the angry man,
then laughed. Pushing past the two men be sauntered to a seat
before the desk and sat down.</p>

<p>"There's a matter of contract, Mr. Ibbotson," he said gently.
"Mr. Parsons drew it up and Sir Rupert signed it but a few weeks
before his death. It mentions a period of five years."</p>

<p>"Contract be damned, I'll fight it!"</p>

<p>Pushing the lawyer to one side Ibbotson strode across the room
until he stood over the newspaperman, his first clenched.</p>

<p>"Fight it?" Bobby's eyebrows elevated quickly. "I think not. Mr. Parsons, your co-trustee, might object."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some moments there was a deep silence in the
room. Bobby lounged back in his chair, outwardly negligent, but
keenly watching the two men through his half shut eyes. Parsons
had gone back to his seat behind the desk. Ibbotson stood
glowering down on the newspaperman.</p>

<p>"You came here because you received information from Mr.
Carruthers that Miss Haffervale had disappeared from her home,
Mr. Ibbotson," Bobby spoke at length. "I can relieve your mind. A
few minutes ago Mr. Parsons told me that Miss Haffervale was
quite well&mdash;and happy. As her trustee he should be well
informed."</p>

<p>"Happy?" The tobacco magnate swung round on the lawyer.
"What's this? The pair of you seem to know more than me. You
don't mean you're sell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ibbotson!" Parsons half rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"That be damned for a tale!" Ibbotson turned again to the
journalist. "What do you know?"</p>

<p>"Just what I have repeated," Bobby smiled. "Did you see the
announcement in the <i>Mirror</i> yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"The announcement?"</p>

<p>"Of the marriage arranged between Lord Carriday and Miss
Myrtle Haffervale." The newspaperman's tones were very
gentle.</p>

<p>"Myrtle marry that&mdash;" For the moment the man could not
speak for rage. Suddenly he turned to the lawyer. "What do you
know of this?"</p>

<p>"I saw the paragraph," Parsons spoke easily. "Sir
Rupert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Made the match possibly as a birthday present to his niece."
Bobby rose from the chair, languidly. "Am I to take it that you
had other marriage arrangements for the young lady, Mr.
Ibbotson?"</p>

<p>He did not wait for an answer, but strolled to the door. There
he turned and nodded mockingly, to the men watching him. He knew
he had scored another point in the strange game.</p>

<p>In the passage he paused a moment. Ibbotson had lied when he
implied that he had not seen the engagement notice in the
<i>Mirror</i>. He had been puzzled and perplexed when he had
quoted the lawyer's words. Now Bobby understood why, during the
strange proceedings at Madlands the previous day, the tobacco
magnate had sat silent, scowling deeply.</p>

<p>What reasons influenced the big man? Bobby tried to
understand. Did the man desire Myrtle's fresh young
beauty&mdash;or the enormous wealth she would control on her
marriage? Whatever the reason, Ibbotson had betrayed himself. He
desired the girl. A shudder shook the journalist's frame as he
envisioned Myrtle in the grasp of that gross, sensual man.</p>

<p>At every turn he found the problem growing more perplexing.
Five of the men who had gathered in the dining room at Madlands
hated the dead man; hated him to a point where they could
consider his death without flinching. The thoughts of Carriday
and Mackenzie centred about the dead woman and her relations with
Sir Rupert. Carriday and Ibbotson were in bitter opposition to
the man who had been their master, in their desire to gain Myrtle
and her millions. Perhaps he was concerned with the Bralley
mortgages, seeking feverishly for traces of the papers the dead
man had refused to entrust to his charge. Gerald Preston hated
the man because of&mdash;No, at the present moment he could not
place a definite fact against the secretary, but he knew that
Gerald had hated the dead man with that blind, unreasoning hatred
that makes killers.</p>

<p>He laughed shortly. The more he examined the problem&mdash;the
more facts he had accumulated&mdash;the greater the mystery. Nine
persons had sat around that dining-room table and eight of
them&mdash;No, he dared not think that. He could not accuse
Myrtle of any part in the death of her uncle&mdash;yet she had
not loved him. But a few hours previous to his death she had
quarrelled over his unauthorised publication of her engagement to
Lord Carriday.</p>

<p>Five men, of the seven who had sat around that table, held for
the dead baronet a blind, unreasoning hatred that might have
blossomed into murder. Of the remaining two&mdash;himself and
Fred Frazer&mdash;</p>

<p>Frazer! Mark Parsons' managing clerk! What connection had he
with the death of the baronet. He had come in frequent contact
with the dead man. With a shrug of his shoulders, and a little
laugh, Bobby turned in the direction of the managing clerk's
office.</p>

<p>"Any objections to visitors." He stood in the half-opened
door, looking at the bent, partially bald, head of the clerk.
"Just came from an interview with your chief, and want cheering
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trayne!" Frazer looked up with a slight smile. "Come in, old
man. The chief upset you?"</p>

<p>"Not possible. He only wanted information regarding the
whereabouts of the Bralley mortgages."</p>

<p>"You know where they are?"</p>

<p>"I have my suspicions."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him."</p>

<p>"Speak to a lawyer of suspicions!" Bobby laughed. "You men of
law want facts, not suspicions. I gave him of my knowledge
freely."</p>

<p>"That means you kept quite a lot to yourself," Frazer
laughed.</p>

<p>"What sort of bloke was Sir Rupert&mdash;in business, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"A brute." The managing clerk's face darkened.</p>

<p>"And, in his private life?"</p>

<p>"A beast of the beasts!"</p>

<p>"So!" The newspaperman shrugged his shoulders. "Then you know
something."</p>

<p>Frazer did not answer. He turned to his work as if seeking to
close the interview. Bobby waited a moment and then strolled up
behind where the man sat.</p>

<p>"Beast or not, Fred, his death has to be revenged." He spoke
gravely. "What do you know?"</p>

<p>Slowly the managing clerk raised his head. Unconsciously his
eyes wandered to the portrait of a young girl, standing on his
desk. Bobby could not see the look that came into the man's eye,
but he felt the shoulder under his hand quiver.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert was murdered," Bobby's tones had become very
grave. "There were eight persons in the room with him when he
died. One of those eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why one of the eight?" Frazer asked the question
irritatedly.</p>

<p>"Because the doors and windows were closed. There was no
possible hope of anyone shooting him from without the room."</p>

<p>The managing clerk did not answer. He bent again over the
papers on the desk. Bobby waited. Presently the man's head raised
with a jerk. Again his eyes sought the portrait on the desk. A
slight sigh escaped his lips.</p>

<p>Bobby stole softly from the room. He held the secret of the
sixth man.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was late in the afternoon before Bobby could
set out on his return to Barrabarra Bay. From the moment he had
left the lawyer's office he had met with difficulties and delays.
Inspector Williams was not at Police Headquarters and nothing had
been heard from him since he left for Madlands to investigate the
death of Sir Rupert Haffervale.</p>

<p>Bobby smiled grimly to himself as he left the tram-car at
Bondi and set out on the long two-mile walk to Barrabarra Bay.
For the first half-mile he proceeded cautiously, believing that
he was followed. But, in spite of careful watching he could not
discover any tracker. It might be that Adam Ibbotson realised
that he would go out to Madlands, and he had stationed his spies
there. The journalist was prepared for that. He had no intention
of going direct to the old house. First, he would go to the
gardener's cottage and from there take up the trail of the
missing heiress.</p>

<p>In spite of the evidence he and Williams had discovered the
previous evening he was certain that Myrtle had been taken there
by her abductors. Later, during the night hours, he would go to
Madlands. He had made his arrangements for getting into the
house.</p>

<p>He was puzzled at the silence of the detective. Williams had
not intended to stay at Barrabarra Bay the previous night. When
Bobby left him at the cottage, to follow Ibbotson back to the
city, the Inspector had spoken of returning to headquarters to
organise the help he would require the following day for a
thorough search of the district. Something had happened to make
the detective change his plans. The newspaperman puzzled his
brains to guess the reason.</p>

<p>Half way on the journey to Barrabarra Bay Bobby struck into
the bush and lay down under a tree. He was early; for he did not
want to get to the cottage until after nightfall. If, as he
believed, the cottage was deserted he would have many lonely
hours in which to make a search. He did not anticipate getting to
Madlands before the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>For some time he lay in the bush watching the road. No one
came along. The surrounding country was silent and apparently
deserted. From where he lay, on a small rise he had a wide view.
Far to the south lay the big bulk of Madlands, glowering under
the rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>From almost under the knoll, wound the sandy road. To the west
of the big house he could see the patch of heavy bush within
which lay the gardener's cottage. For as far as his sight could
reach he could not see another house; yet he knew that within the
hollows, and behind the low hills, were concealed several
residences. Somewhere in that wide stretch of country Myrtle
Haffervale, held prisoner by one of the men he knew had desired
Sir Rupert's death. But, on which of the men could he lay the
abduction?</p>

<p>He knew that both Lord Carriday and Adam Ibbotson desired the
girl. He knew that Mark Parsons and Godfrey Mackenzie were
secretly planning to obtain control of the huge fortune Matthew
Haffervale had left in trust for his only child.</p>

<p>He could dismiss Gerald Preston and Fred Frazer from his
calculations. However much the two men hated the dead baronet,
neither of them had the means or the ability to plan the murder
and the abduction of the heiress. No, he had to decide on one of
the other four&mdash;and he smiled grimly as their names passed
through his mind. If he uttered his thoughts and suspicions, who,
of the inhabitants of Sydney, would believe they were capable of
the deed.</p>

<p>Six men must lie under suspicion of the murders: four of them
of the abduction of Myrtle Haffervale. Could he fasten the crimes
on any one man? So far as his information lay the guilt lay
equally between the four&mdash;if, indeed, the crimes were not
the work of one master-mind.</p>

<p>The sun had descended into the wide open sea before Bobby came
out of his shelter and strode down the road in the direction of
Madlands. Just before he reached the gates of the drive-way he
turned to the opposite side of the road, and, opened the
wicket-gate leading to the gardener's cottage.</p>

<p>The place was in darkness. Bobby, keeping well in the shade of
the thick bush, cautiously approached the front door. Satisfied
that no one was in the front rooms he swerved into the bush again
and circled the house. Stealing, on silent feet, up to the back
door, the newspaper man satisfied himself that the place was
deserted, then tried the door handle.</p>

<p>The door was unfastened. Bobby stepped back with a low
exclamation. What did the unfastened door mean? Williams would
not have left the place like that. Then who had been there since
the detective left?</p>

<p>The problem suggested another. Where was the Inspector? He had
intended to return to town the previous night, and had not. Had
he remained out of Madlands? That was improbable, for he would
surely have communicated his plans to the newspaperman. But would
he have done so? Williams was a cautious and suspicious man. He
would not speak openly over the telephone.</p>

<p>A sudden thought crossed Bobby's mind. Did the detective
suspect him of the murder of Sir Rupert? He could not suspect him
of the murder of Alice Mackenzie, for he had been in the
detective's company from the moment the woman had left Madlands
until the discovery of her dead body in the cottage. But, of the
eight persons in the dining-room at Madlands, he, of all, had had
the best opportunity to shoot the baronet, and hide the gun.</p>

<p>Again he approached the cottage door and silently swung it
open. The interior of the house was in darkness. Bobby pulled a
torch from his pocket and, concealing the light under his coat,
played it around the kitchen. There was no one there; the place
was in the same litter in which he and Williams had found it.</p>

<p>He crept into the kitchen and shut the door behind him. The
key was in the lock and he turned it, silently. Again he flashed
his light around. Why was the key in the lock, within the door?
Had the Inspector left the cottage by the back door, without
taking out the key and fastening the door? That would be unlike
him.</p>

<p>The wide kitchen occupied the whole of the rear portion of the
house, with the exception of a narrow space, used as a store
room. The newspaperman opened the door and peered into the small
space. It was bare and swept. A door opened from the store into
the small yard at the rear. That door was fastened and the key
missing. From the kitchen a door opened into a narrow passage,
dividing the living room from the bedroom.</p>

<p>There was no one in the passage nor, so far as Bobby could
judge by intent listening, in either of the rooms. He stole up
the passage and opened the bedroom door. Involuntarily, his eyes
went to the bed on which they had found the dead woman. She was
no longer there. No doubt she now rested in the Mackenzie house,
some mile and a half away. On the small table by the bed stood
the shoe he believed to belong to Myrtle&mdash;the shoe he had
found just within the door. Why had Williams left it there?
Surely it was a valuable clue and should be in his charge. Bobby
crossed the room and, lifting the shoe from the table, thrust it
in his pocket. He disliked to see it there, in that room where
the dead man and woman had consummated their illicit passion.</p>

<p>Quietly and methodically he quartered the room, searching for
some sign that would, put him on the track of the murderer. He
could see evidence of the careful search made by Williams. The
place had been examined with meticulous care. With a shrug of his
shoulders he turned from the room and crossed to the door of the
living room.</p>

<p>As his hand found the handle of the door he heard the sound of
feet advancing up the path to the cottage. He looked around him,
anxiously. Where could he hide? He did not want to be caught
there. He opened the living-room door and stepped in. A quick
glance around showed him a cupboard set in the corner. He stepped
silently to it and pulled open the door. If the new-comers did
not search the house the place would serve.</p>

<p>The steps came closer and paused at the front door. Bobby
stood just within the cupboard, the door held ajar. His hand
sought his hip-pocket for the automatic that was there. He
withdrew the gun and slipped it into a side pocket of his jacket.
The lock of the front door clicked loudly under the key. Two men
stamped into the small hall, talking in low tones.</p>

<p>Bobby waited; tensed with excitement. Who were the men? He
tried to catch some of the words&mdash;an inflection of a
voice&mdash;but could not. He stood, waiting for the moment when
he would have to step into the cupboard and pull the door
shut.</p>

<p>A hand caught at the knob of the living-room door.</p>

<p>Bobby withdrew into his retreat, closing the door silently.
The men entered the room, noisily.</p>

<p>"Anything to eat in this dug-out, Charlie?" One of the men
inquired. A chair creaked under a heavy weight.</p>

<p>"Dunno. Maybe but it'll be stale. What d' yer always wanting
to be eating for?"</p>

<p>"What's biting you? We haven't had a bite since we left Bondi,
early this afternoon."</p>

<p>The first voice spoke aggrievedly. "Well, have a look. Got a
match? I'm not going to sit in the dark until he comes."</p>

<p>Bobby withdrew further into the cupboard. He could not
recognise either of the voices, Who was the "he" the men had come
there to wait for?</p>

<p>"S'pose the fodder's in the kitchen." Heavy feet strode across
the carpeted floor. The door opened and slapped noisily. Again a
chair creaked, and the odour of tobacco scented the air. For some
minutes there was silence broken only by the creaking of the
chair as the remaining man moved to his seat.</p>

<p>Bobby tried to plan. Should he go out of the cupboard and
challenge the men?</p>

<p>"Say, Charlie. Have a look here. Someone's been in the
place."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Know the shoe that was on the table in the other
room&mdash;the bedroom. It's gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"Straight. He'll be wild. Didn't he go off at us because we
left it behind the first time&mdash;and she wasn't any
lightweight to handle."</p>

<p>"Who's been here?"</p>

<p>"That dick!"</p>

<p>"Talk sense. How could he get here?"</p>

<p>"Well, someone's been here!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's about. Never know. Active sort of chap,
him!"</p>

<p>"Sad he wouldn't return till dark."</p>

<p>"Found anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't above a peck then? Thought you wasn't
hungry?"</p>

<p>"Talk sense. Found anything?"</p>

<p>"Some tinned stuff in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Fetch it in. Any bread&mdash;and booze."</p>

<p>"Plenty booze. Bread in pan&mdash;a bit stale."</p>

<p>"Fetch it in. We'll have to get a move on. Don't want him to
catch us in the middle of a feed."</p>

<p>"Give a hand then. Don't want me to wait on you?"</p>

<p>Bobby heard the two men move towards the door. He moved to one
side, to try and get a look at them through the crack of the
door, and rubbed hard against something soft. A cloud of dust
flooded the little space. For a moment Bobby choked, stuffing the
handkerchief into his mouth. The air was stifling and in the
spasms he pushed slightly against the door.</p>

<p>"What's that?" one of the men spoke hastily.</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"There's someone here."</p>

<p>Then Bobby sneezed loudly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">"HANDS UP!" With a thrust of his shoulder Bobby
forced back the cupboard door and sprang into the room. The two
crooks were at the door of the room, half turned towards him;
their faces expressing astonishment.</p>

<p>"Up with your hands, quick!" The levelled automatic in the
journalist's hand menaced the two men. "Come forward and shut the
door. Get a move on, or I'll fire."</p>

<p>The man did not move from the door. The foremost turned wholly
to face Bobby, an impudent grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Own the cottage, bo?" A slight movement placed him before his
comrade. "Why, if I'm not mistaken, Charlie, it's our little
newspaper friend, doing a wild-west stunt&mdash;and we're the
crooks from Mystery Range. Put up your hands, pard, or the little
popgun may go off. He's a real bad-man and shoots from the hip,
with both hands."</p>

<p>The other man guffawed loudly. In mock terror he raised his
hands high in the air. For the moment Bobby felt disturbed. Had
be chanced on a couple of tramps seeking shelter in the cottage
for the night? But, if so why had they referred to someone who
was to meet them there? In the few words of conversation he had
overheard there had been constant reference to a "he," whose
orders they were obeying.</p>

<p>"Come from that door." He allowed his gun-hand to fall to his
side. "And not so much talk. There's a few questions you have to
answer before I let you go."</p>

<p>"All right." Charlie spoke without hesitation. He moved into
the room and took his seat at the table. "Get ahead with it,
boss. The missus doesn't like me out late. Thinks I may get into
bad company."</p>

<p>Following the example of his friend the second man strolled
back into the room and seated himself. Broad grins were on their
faces as they watched the journalist. Yet, under their apparent
nonchalance, Bobby could defect a careful watchfulness.</p>

<p>"Who's the man you referred to as 'he'?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"He?" Charlie, who had evidently constituted himself
spokesman, looked puzzled. He turned to his mate. "Were you
talking about 'he,' Ted. If I know you, you'd be more likely to
yarn about some bit of skirt."</p>

<p>"That's enough of that." Bobby advanced a pace, standing on
the opposite side of the table to the two men. "You know well to
whom I refer. I want the name of that man."</p>

<p>"Anything else, boss?"</p>

<p>"Where's the girl you took from here? Oh, you needn't look at
your friend. I overheard quite a lot while I was in that
cupboard. You'd best come clean, I'll take you into Bondi and
hand you over to the police, on a charge of abduction. Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"Girl?" Ted spoke, grinning broadly. "Why you don't mean the
stiff-un we carried out of here this afternoon? 'bout a mile an'
a half away. Big house among a lot of trees. The old chap said
she was 'is wife and paid us well for the job. She warn't no
light weight, either. We earned all we got, didn't we
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"I say so." The other man nodded, affirmatively. "My arms
ached before the job was over."</p>

<p>He stretched his arms before him across the table. Bobby
watched him vaguely. Had he been mistaken? Had the men before him
carried from that cottage the corpse of Alice Mackenzie? That was
what their words inferred. And he had thought they had taken
Myrtle.</p>

<p>"What of that shoe you spoke about?" The newspaperman turned
sharply to Ted. "You said he'd be wild at you leaving it behind
the first time. What did you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said." The man grinned impudently. "S'pose the
old bloke wanted his wife complete. She hadn't any shoes on as
she lay on the bed. If you'd been 'ere you'd have seen that."</p>

<p>Bobby was staggered. He remembered that the dead woman had not
had shoes on her feet when she lay on the bed. He had not
attached any significance to that, at the moment. He had been
obsessed with the theory that the shoe he had found within the
door of the room belonged to Myrtle. He had believed that the
shoe he had found by the sun dial In the gardens of Madlands
belonged to Myrtle. With that thought in his mind he had jumped
to the conclusion that the similar shoe he had found in the
bedroom of the cottage was a mate to the shoe in his pocket. He
had not compared them, closely.</p>

<p>For some moments be stood casting his memory back on the
incidents. It the shoes were not a pair then they matched so
closely that not only he but Inspector Williams had been
deceived. Could he trust the word of the men before him? They
suggested that the shoe he had found in the cottage belonged to
the dead woman. Was he to suppose that the shoe he had found in
the Madlands gardens also belonged to her? If so, then Alice
Mackenzie wandered from the house, after her interview with
Inspector Williams, down to the sundial. There she had lost her
shoe&mdash;how? Had she deliberately kicked it off and then
hobbled through the grounds to the gardener's cottage?</p>

<p>The supposition was absurd. If he had to assume that the shoe
he had found by the sundial belonged to Alice Mackenzie then he
must assume that the woman had been murdered in the Madlands
gardens. That would explain the small amount of blood he had
found in the cottage. If Alice Mackenzie had been murdered by the
old sundial in the Madlands gardens, and the murderers, in taking
her corpse from the spot, had lost one of her shoes then what had
happened to Myrtle Haffervale? She had promised to meet him by
the old sundial. Had she witnessed the murder of Alice
Mackenzie? Had the shock affected her brain, and was she
wandering somewhere in the bushlands of Barrabarra Bay, her brain
disordered, afraid to go back to her home?</p>

<p>The theory held possibilities. Even if only partially true, it
destroyed all the work he had accomplished during the past
twenty-four hours. He would have to go back to the
beginning&mdash;to the moment when Sir Rupert Haffervale fell
dead across the dining-room table, and work forward
again&mdash;and that with many of the varied links in the chain
of theory destroyed.</p>

<p>"That all you want, guvner?" Charlie spoke, his voice full of
insolence.</p>

<p>Bobby glanced across the table at the crook. The man's hands
were resting on the edge of the table. A baneful, hopeful look
shone in his small eyes. Almost as Bobby realised his danger the
two crooks pushed strongly at the table, throwing him violently
to the ground.</p>

<p>The door of the room slammed shut before he could regain his
feet. He heard horrid derisive laughter in the small hall. Then,
the outer door was shut and running feet passed the window. Bobby
rushed to the door and wrenched it open.</p>

<p>Outside, on the path he hesitated. Night had fallen and he
could only see a few yards from the cottage. He pulled out his
torch and pressed the button. The brilliant ray of light
illuminated the path to the gate. There was no one there. He
swept the light along the edge of the bush on either side of the
path. He could see no one; the two men had entirely
disappeared.</p>

<p>Should he go back to the cottage and await the mysterious "he"
the two men had come there to meet? That would be useless; the
crooks would take care to intercept and warn the unknown of his
presence. The man would not come to the cottage.</p>

<p>With a muttered curse, Bobby turned back to the cottage and
continued his search. He found nothing of importance in the
bedroom and returned to the dining-room. A decanter of wine stood
on the sideboard. Seeking a fresh glass Bobby poured out the wine
and raised the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>One sip and he placed the glass on the table. The wine had a
queer taste. The bottles of whisky stood on the sideboard,
unopened. By one of them lay a corkscrew. Bobby went to the table
and examined the glasses lying on it&mdash;the glasses the crooks
had placed there. Neither had been used. He lifted the bottles
and examined the corks.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, the bottles had not been tampered
with. Only the wine in the decanter had been drugged. When had
that wine been brought to the room?</p>

<p>Alice Mackenzie had kept an assignment in that cottage the
previous evening. With whom? Not with Sir Rupert; for Mark
Parsons had declared that the dead baronet had been with him all
that evening. Who had been her partner in the supper, the remains
of which Williams and he had found on the table when first they
entered the cottage?</p>

<p>Had that wine been decanted for that illicit supper-party. Had
that wine been doctored before Alice and her lover had sat down
to that table? Or, had someone, knowing that he would revisit the
cottage, drugged the wine, in the hope that he would drink
it?</p>

<p>Bobby locked the doors of the cottage, determined to return
there in daylight and take a sample of the drugged wine for
analysis. Stepping lightly, he walked down the path to the gate,
and after a long and careful scrutiny of the road, passed
through. A glance at the illuminated face of his watch showed
that it was just past ten o'clock. It was too early to go to
Madlands. The servants would he awake. He must wait until after
midnight, for he had the intention of examining the big house
without disturbing the inmates.</p>

<p>The two crooks had spoken of carrying Alice Mackenzie's corpse
to her home. Had they done so? Bobby knew that the chain-store
magnate had intended to get the gardeners from Madlands to carry
his wife to his home. Were the two men who came to the cottage
the gardeners Martin had referred to as working in the gully on
the other side of the big house.</p>

<p>He would go to Mackenzie's house and question him. He did not
expect any enthusiastic welcome, but if his questions were framed
carefully he might extract some information.</p>

<p>Bobby smiled grimly. Why were the four men so antagonistic to
him? They were placing every obstacle in his way. Yet the murder
of Sir Rupert Haffervale could not be the concerted plan of the
four men. The death of Alice Mackenzie might well be placed to
her husband's account. He had traced her to the cottage on one of
the occasions, when she had gone there to meet her lover. He had
said he had left her there! Would any sane husband do that?</p>

<p>Mackenzie had found absolute proof that his wife was carrying
on an intrigue with a man. Would he not have faced the guilty
pair and denounced them&mdash;perhaps taking immediate revenge
for her soiled honour? Instead, he had turned on his heel and
come away from the cottage, leaving his wife with her paramour.
The suggestion was inconceivable!</p>

<p>Bobby strode down the road. He had a good knowledge of the
locality. Some half mile along the road he would find a path
through the bush that would lead him to the Mackenzie house. He
passed over a culvert and halted a moment. From where he stood he
commanded a good view of Madlands. Lights were still in the
windows. A couple of hours and the household would retire for the
night. Then would come his opportunity.</p>

<p>He found the path he sought through the bush, with some little
difficulty. It was rough and worn. Walking carefully and slowly,
Bobby pushed on. He had not yet determined what he should do when
he reached Treview&mdash;the Mackenzie's home. He would wait
until he had seen it. A sudden thought came Into his mind. Was
Mackenzie the "he" the crooks had awaited at the gardener's
cottage?</p>

<p>A turn in the path, and Bobby halted suddenly, drawing back
into the shade of a bush. A few yards before him opened a little
glade.</p>

<p>Walking across the open space were a man and a girl.
Immediately he recognised Gerald Preston. Who was his companion?
Bobby stared with unbelieving eyes. He was certain the girl was
Myrtle.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">BOBBY stepped further into the deep shadows. He
was certain the girl was Myrtle. What was she doing there, within
a few yards of Mackenzie's house?</p>

<p>Unconscious they were watched, Myrtle and Gerald strolled
towards the house, talking earnestly. So far as Bobby could
interpret their gestures the secretary was urging the girl to
some course against which she protested. His gestures were
insistent, and continually she shook her head. At the edge of the
clearing, where the path again entered the bush, they halted.
Gerald half-turned away, but the girl stayed him, laying her hand
on his arm. For some minutes she spoke in low earnest tones, the
man every now and again shaking his head.</p>

<p>At length, Myrtle, with a gesture of despair, turned and
walked quickly up the path. Gerald stayed, looking after her for
a few seconds, then retraced his steps across the glade, passing
close to where Bobby crouched in shadows. For the moment, the
newspaperman had the impulse to step out of his concealment and
challenge Gerald. But, what could he do? He could question, but
the man need not reply. He could voice his suspicions&mdash;and
Gerald would only laugh.</p>

<p>Myrtle had left Madlands. Where had she gone to? Why had she
left her home before keeping the appointment she had made with
him, beside the old sundial? The assignation had been of her
seeking&mdash;why had she broken it?</p>

<p>Bobby watched Gerald disappear into the bush. He turned along
the path the girl had taken. She had passed out of sight.
Crossing the glade, Bobby pressed on until he came within sight
of the house. Myrtle was not before him. Where had she gone to?
He was certain that unless she had greatly quickened her pace he
must have overtaken her before she came within sight of Treview.
Could she have turned from the path on to a side-track? Using his
torch freely, Bobby retraced his path. There was no track leading
off on either side. Greatly puzzled, he returned to the edge of
the bush, opposite the house. A wire fence crossed the path, and
beyond lay the gardens. Slipping through the wires Bobby crossed
the belt of shrubbery and came to the lawns. The house was
brilliantly lit. The previous afternoon Mackenzie had brought to
his home, from the gardener's cottage, the dead body of his
wife&mdash;She lay in that house&mdash;and Mackenzie had lit the
place as if he were celebrating some time of rejoicing! The
blinds were drawn at the upstairs windows. On the ground floor,
every room showed a light, and some of the blinds were not
drawn.</p>

<p>Bobby, from where he crouched, could see shadows moving within
some of the rooms. There seemed to be quite a number of people
within the house. If he could get across the open lawns, into the
shadows of the house! If he could find the reason for the strange
illumination of the place! There was&mdash;there must be&mdash;a
reason for this strange action. Mackenzie was not insane, yet who
but a madman could conceive the illumination of his house while
its mistress lay cold beneath its roof.</p>

<p>A sudden clouding of the moon gave him the opportunity. Before
the quiet rays again lit the gardens, Bobby had crossed and was
crouching under some shrubs, close in against one of the windows.
Cautiously, he raised his head until he could peer into the room.
There was no one there.</p>

<p>Exercising the utmost caution, he crept along the wall until
he came to another window. Here he could hear voices, for the
window sash was raised a few inches. Almost immediately he
recognised the chain-store magnate's harsh tones. There were
other voices speaking, but so low that he could not recognise
them. Again he reached upwards, until he could peer into the
room. He had not been mistaken. Mackenzie was in the room and
with him two other men. With, amazement Bobby recognised Ibbotson
and Carriday. What were they doing with Mackenzie at that time of
night?</p>

<p>The three men were speaking so low that he could not
distinguish their words. He moved a few paces to one side of the
soft soil and thrust his hand into his pocket. A moment later he
reached up and fastened a little round instrument to the glass.
Now he could hear plainly through the receiver pressed to his
ear.</p>

<p>"I tell you, I will have nothing to do with the matter."
Mackenzie was speaking! "Matthew Haffervale's will is very
definite. The girl enjoys the income of the trust from her coming
of age."</p>

<p>"And if there is no income?" Carriday spoke.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" The harsh voice protested. "How can we stop the
money coming in? Why, the <i>Mirror</i> alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Parsons will do as he is told." Ibbotson spoke for the first
time. "Does that help?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I take Rupert Haffervale's place as trustee,"
the tobacco magnate answered, angrily. "I'll answer for the
interests I control. Parsons can wangle the <i>Mirror</i> funds.
Carriday says he can work the outback interests. It rests with
you, Mackenzie. It you come in with us we can control the
Haffervale trust. A few manipulations on the stock exchange and
the shares will fall&mdash;fall into a bottomless pit. When we're
ready&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think Parsons will stand for that?" Mackenzie asked.</p>

<p>"He won't know&mdash;any more than we want him to," Carriday
laughed.</p>

<p>"He'll think we want to work some game with the <i>Mirror</i>.
I'll fix a story for him. When the bottom tumbles out of things
he may protest, but he'll be helpless. He can only stand and look
on."</p>

<p>"He may have a story to tell." The chain-store magnate's voice
showed he was half-persuaded.</p>

<p>"Parsons is looking for the Bralley deeds," Ibbotson
interjected, "Why, I haven't found out yet, but I will. There's
something queer there. 'Course, there's a quarter of a million of
money locked up in that fake oil show&mdash;but there's not a
cent of interest coming in&mdash;They're no good to the
girl."</p>

<p>"Well, I take it that we act together and knock the bottom out
of the Haffervale thrust."</p>

<p>Mackenzie spoke after a long pause. "What then?"</p>

<p>"The girl will be left without a cent to her name." Carriday
answered quickly. "She'll be dependent on our charity&mdash;and
ready to do as she is told."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"She'll accept the little arrangement that Rupert Haffervale
and I arranged; Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean the marriage?" Ibbotson spoke quickly. "Is it
necessary to go as far as that?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"This." Bobby heard a chair pushed roughly back and the steps
of the big man on the floor. "You don't want the girl. She's not
your sort. You want women, like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Carriday interjected,
brusquely. "Wasn't it the arrangement that I was to marry without
settlements the girl, and get control of the Trust. Then
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't arrange that with Rupert." Ibbotson laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>"Never mind what arrangement Rupert Haffervale and I had."
Carriday's voice indicated anxiety. "I'm to marry the girl
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She objects to marrying you,", interrupted the big man. For
some seconds there was silence, then: "You think she'll be
willing to marry you?"</p>

<p>Again a long silence. Bobby peered up. The three men were on
their feet. Ibbotson and Carriday glaring at each other across
the table. Suddenly the big man moved, as if to spring at the
Englishman, but Mackenzie interposed.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?"</p>

<p>"At Madlands, of course, you fool!" Ibbotson spoke with sudden
heat.</p>

<p>"She is not." The harsh tones were level. "Inspector Williams told me yesterday afternoon that Myrtle had left the house. He
said, abducted."</p>

<p>"Abducted!" The two men swung round to face the chain-store
proprietor. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She knew something." There was a tinge of anxiety in the
harsh tones. "She made an appointment to meet that damned
journalist at the old sundial. He went there and waited, but
Myrtle did not keep the appointment. Then he found one of her
shoes close by&mdash;and he and the detective worked it out that
she had been taken prisoner and carried away."</p>

<p>Bobby cursed the Inspector for a talkative fool. What did he
mean by revealing clues they held to the man they held under
suspicion of murder?</p>

<p>"By God, If that's true&mdash;" The big voice range through
the room.</p>

<p>"Carriday, what do you know of this?"</p>

<p>"I?" The smooth English accents turned to a higher pitch.
"What have I to do with the girl? I'm prepared to marry her; if
by doing so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kind!" Ibbotson sneered. "Look here, lord or not, if you
injure that girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bobby had just time to wrench the dictaphone from the glass
and crouch under the lee of a bush before the big bulk of the
tobacco magnate darkened the glass. The window was flung
violently open and the man leaned far out into the night. Waiting
his opportunity the newspaperman crept along the line of wall
until he was out of sight of the window. He had gained knowledge,
but little that fitted into the story of Sir Rupert's murder he
was trying to construct.</p>

<p>Now he knew that Myrtle was the centre of a conspiracy to
deprive her of her fortune, even of her person. Could he believe
that none of the men in the room were innocent of the abduction
of the girl? But, had Myrtle been abducted? He had seen her but a
bare hour ago free and unharmed, In the bush, a few yards from
the house. He believed that she had turned from the path, towards
some secret hiding-place.</p>

<p>Again he crept forward, keeping close to the wall. At every
window he peered in, to find the rooms empty, though well lit.
Again he came to the study window, where he had listened to the
three men talking, and peered in. The room was empty, although
the lower window sash was pushed fully up.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse came to him. He caught at the edge of the
window sill and drew himself up until he could see the whole of
the room. There was no one there. For a moment he slipped back to
the ground, then sprang up, trying to get his knee on to the
sill.</p>

<p>Something hit him on the back of his head. His fingers relaxed
and he slipped back on the soft soil. Again something heavy and
soft struck him and he pitched forward&mdash;the faint moonlight
fading from before his staring eyes.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">A RAY of moonlight crept through the bush and
rested on the still form of the young man lying in the glade. He
stirred slightly, faint moans coming from between his clenched
teeth. One hand went up to his forehead&mdash;to come away
red-wet.</p>

<p>He rolled to one side to avoid the faint light and opened his
eyes. For some time he stared, uncomprehendingly, up at the
dim-lit sky; then slowly around him!</p>

<p>He was in the glade where he had seen Myrtle and Gerald; but
he was certain that he had not returned there of his own
volition. For minutes he remained with his head in his hands,
trying to order the incidents of the night. He recalled that he
had been under the study window at Treview when he had been
struck down. He remembered feeling one of the bushes breaking his
fall; the branches tearing at his face. Then, someone must have
carried him from the house to the glade; abandoning him to live
or die.</p>

<p>With an effort he sat up. His eyes fell in his hands and
opened wide, in horror. They were covered with blood. Suddenly
something obstructed his vision; his eyes were filled with
moisture. Dragging his handkerchief from his pocket he mopped his
face. As he withdrew his handkerchief he saw that it was stained
with blood. He heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>He had not killed anyone; the blood on his hands had come from
his own head. He put his hand to his head again and felt it
gingerly. There was a big broken bruise across the crown.</p>

<p>Who had caught him at the window of Treview? Bobby was
inclined to believe that Ibbotson had been his assailant. The man
was a brute and, if he had caught him watching, would hit,
vindictively. Again, the taking of his unconscious body to the
glade and leaving it there&mdash;callous whether he was dead or
alive&mdash;was typical of the man.</p>

<p>Lying on his side he managed to pull pencil and paper from his
pocket and tried to set down the words he had overheard spoken in
the Treview study. They were ambiguous, but the indications were
clear. Myrtle was to be robbed. The Haffervale Trust was to be
broken. The three men who owed their wealth to Matthew
Haffervale's financial genius were to share the spoils. Myrtle
was to become the prey of Carriday&mdash;if Ibbotson
permitted.</p>

<p>Honour among thieves! Bobby grinned. Already the seeds of
discord were germinating among the crooks. Let Ibbotson gain
advantage in the division of the spoil; let him get a hold over
the Englishman; and Myrtle would become the main point of
dispute.</p>

<p>Already Ibbotson held Carriday at his mercy. Enough had been
said in the Treview study to show the newspaperman that the
Englishman feared that Mackenzie should know of his intrigue with
his wife. Ibbotson knew of it. Then why had he not spoken?
Perhaps he was awaiting proof. Perhaps he thought it would pay
him to delay the inevitable rupture. When their schemes were so
far advanced that Carriday's defection could not wreck them; when
Ibbotson had obtained absolute proof of the connection between
the beef baron and the dead woman; then he would speak.</p>

<p>Mark Parsons was an associate of the rogues. He was to be
bribed with the Bralley documents. Bobby grinned. It would be
some time, if ever, before the lawyer received the price of his
treachery.</p>

<p>Already the finger of fate pointed towards the end. Parsons
and Carriday were to be sacrificed and discarded&mdash;when the
work required from them been accomplished, Ibbotson and
Mackenzie, the greater rogues, would divide the spoils&mdash;the
girl falling to the hands of the tobacco magnate.</p>

<p>The pains in his head became more intense. He thrust the
papers into his pocket and lay back, closing his eyes. Gradually
the light dimmed; thoughts became misty and vague. Sleep overcame
him, dulling the throbbing on his brain.</p>

<p>He dreamed. He thought that a white-clad figure flitted into
the glade and stared around, bewilderedly. It moved across the
clearing, as if searching for something. Suddenly it stopped,
poised as if listening to some distant sound. A moment and it
blended into the bush.</p>

<p>Two men came along the path from the house to the clearing.
Bobby recognised Ibbotson and Mackenzie. They stared about,
bewilderedly&mdash;if missing something.</p>

<p>"So, he wasn't dead." Ibbotson's deep voice rumbled through
the bush-like silence. "Pity! I thought I hit hard enough."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not kill!" The words sounded grotesque, coming in
the harsh accents of the Scot.</p>

<p>"Getting religious?" Bobby now realised that he was not
dreaming. "You didn't make a fuss when Haffervale went out. But,
this blasted journalist! Mark my words, Mac. We're going to have
trouble with that young man."</p>

<p>"He's gone." The chain-store magnate showed relief in his
voice. "Suppose he came to his senses and crawled away. Best come
home, Adam. If he's anywhere about he will be suspicious if he
finds us searching for him."</p>

<p>A soft hand touched Bobby's face. He nearly cried out. He
looked up to see a girl's face bending over him.</p>

<p>"Myrtle!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Bobby. They mustn't find you."</p>

<p>"I thought they had taken you prisoner." The words came
drowsily. "I've been trying to find you. Sure you're safe, old
girl? You'd better get away. Doesn't matter if they find me, but
you Myrtle, that man's a beast. He&mdash;he
wants&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know." The girl bent lower, until her cheek almost rested
beside his. "But I'm safe. I'm with friends, Bobby&mdash;Bobby,
are you asleep, dear?"</p>

<p>Something soft, infinitely gentle, crept around his neck. His
head rested peacefully against a breast that fell in regular
soothing sequences. He was happy&mdash;but so sleepy. He closed
his eyes wearily.</p>

<p><br> AGAIN he awoke and looked around. He was alone but his
head, though sore, had ceased to throb. For long moments he
stared about. Had he dreamed&mdash;or had Myrtle been with him?
Had she knelt beside him, gathering his broken head into her
young, strong arms; soothing, comforting him? Had he seen
Ibbotson and Mackenzie searching for him; intent on completing
the murder the big man had commenced outside Treview.</p>

<p>He gained his feet, holding on to a branch of a tree.
Gradually strength returned and he staggered down to the path
through the glade. There he hesitated, then turned in the
direction of Treview. He would see if the household had retired
for the night; but he must act cautiously.</p>

<p>Action started the chilled blood coursing through his veins.
Before he came within sight of the house he was feeling almost
fit again. A stubborn determination came over him to get even
with the rogues. He knew what they were planning. A few inquiries
and he would he able to play a hand against them.</p>

<p>Myrtle had said that she was safe with friends. But why had
she deserted him in the glade? Could she not have waited until he
had fully recovered? Could she not have told him what she had
planned to tell him beside the old sundial and scheme with him
for her ultimate safety and triumph over the men who menaced her
and her fortune.</p>

<p>He came in sight of the house and halted. The windows were in
darkness, except for a couple of the upstairs rooms. Keeping in
the shelter of the bushes the newspaperman circled the house. Few
lights showed. Either Mackenzie and his guests had retired for
the night or they were in the bushland, searching for him.</p>

<p>The latter was unlikely. They had carried him to the glade and
there left him; returning later to make certain whether he was
alive or dead. They would not search the bush at that time of
night. They could not guess which direction he had taken.</p>

<p>To make inquiries at any of the scattered houses in the
district would be dangerous.</p>

<p>No. Ibbotson and Mackenzie were in the house. Bobby turned and
walked down the track to the main road. He would go to Madlands
and take up the second part of his planned search.</p>

<p>On the main road he broke into a dogtrot. A glance at his
watch had shown him that it was a little past midnight. A grin
came on his face. Rarely had he crowded so many adventures into
so few hours.</p>

<p>Within sight of the entrance gates of Madlands he slowed to a
moderate walk. The gates were open and the lodge cottage in
darkness. Walking on the turf he went towards the house. Unless
the servants had been very alert he had his entrance to the house
arranged.</p>

<p>The bent catch of the dining-room window gave to his
pen-knife. Bobby slipped into the room and fastened the window
again. During the early hours of the morning he proposed to
search until be found the secret of Sir Rupert's death.</p>

<p>He wanted the gun from which the fatal shot had been fired. He
was certain that it had not been removed from the room, and that
in spite of the careful search Inspector Williams and he had
made. Somewhere in the room was the cartridge from which the
bullet had sped. If the gun was a revolver then the cartridge was
still in the chamber; if an automatic, the piece of brass he
sought lay somewhere in the room.</p>

<p>By the light of his torch he quartered the room, searching
minutely, for any sign of the cartridge. He did not expect to
find it loose, for Williams had been most eager to discover it.
He searched to satisfy the doubt. Had Sir Rupert been killed by a
bullet from an automatic or a revolver?</p>

<p>He came to the head of the table, his search almost completed.
He looked at his wristwatch. It wanted a minute to one o'clock.
For a moment he allowed the torch-light to play on the surface of
the table. The watch and papers had been removed. Even the white
powder the Inspector had used in searching for fingerprints had
been wiped away. The smooth, glass-like surface gave no clue.</p>

<p>He stepped back from the table and the light fell on the
carpet. Something glistened in the dazzling rays. He bent to pick
it up and stumbled, catching at an edge of the table.</p>

<p>Instinctively he ducked. A slight grating noise had been
followed by a shot. He had felt the wind of the bullet as it
passed his head.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some moments Bobby remained kneeling at the
head of the table, straining his eyes into the darkness of the
room. Someone had shot at him&mdash;and he could have sworn he
was the only person in the room!</p>

<p>The shot had come from the other end of the long dining-room
table. He had felt the bullet pass his head; he had heard it
impinge on the wall. It had come from the same direction as had
the shot that had killed Sir Rupert. What did it mean?</p>

<p>The shot had been preceded by a strange noise. He had not
heard that noise the previous day. But Bobby knew that he was not
mistaken. It had sounded as if some machinery had been set in
motion. But, there is no machinery in the room. The Inspector and
he had searched thoroughly the previous day.</p>

<p>Bobby sprang to his feet. The shot had sounded loudly in the
silence of the house. It was certain the sound had penetrated
beyond the room. If it had woken the inmates they would come to
investigate. He would be discovered&mdash;and explanations were
tedious.</p>

<p>He must get from the room, but he would not leave the house
until he had resolved the many doubts in his head. He turned to
the window&mdash;and hesitated. Not that way! If anyone came to
investigate they would believe, on not finding anyone in the
room, that the intruder had escaped through the window. He must
get into the body of the house.</p>

<p>A wrench of his fingers and the window-hasp broke. Pushing out
the window he sprang across the room to the door and opened it.
The hall was in darkness. Listening intently, he thought he could
hear movements in upper parts of the house.</p>

<p>He darted into the darkness of the hall, to one of the tall
columns between the hall door and the stairway. Crouching there,
he waited. Now he could hear distinct sounds from upstairs. A
moment and a light flashed on the upper floor. The shuffle of
slippered feet sounded on polished boards. Someone was coming to
the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>The lights on the stairway sprang to life. Bobby stifled a cry
of amazement. Inspector Williams, clad in a vivid suit of
pyjamas, came in sight. He ran down the stairs and turned to the
dining-room.</p>

<p>What was the Inspector doing at Madlands? Early that day Bobby
had rung up police headquarters to obtain news of the detective;
to be informed that he had not reported since he left to
investigate the death of Sir Rupert Haffervale. Now he found him
at Madlands, coming from one of the bedrooms!</p>

<p>Bobby rose to his feet, to follow the detective to the
dining-room. Then the lights on the stairs were suddenly
extinguished. The journalist drew back behind the pillar. Someone
was coming stealthily down the stairs. Bobby strained his eyes
through the darkness. It was evident that the newcomer was
trailing the detective.</p>

<p>Williams had left the dining-room door half-open and had
switched on the lights in the room. A few minutes and a shadow
passed between Bobby and the door. With a start, the newspaperman
recognised the silhouette of Gerald Preston.</p>

<p>Gerald was trailing the detective! For what reason? Bobby
stole after the secretary. Here was another mystery added to
those he had already to solve.</p>

<p>At the door of the dining-room Gerald stepped to one side,
peering around the door-jamb into the room. From a few paces
further back Bobby obtained a fair view of the room. Williams was
standing by the open window, fingering the broken catch.</p>

<p>The situation was abnormal. Bobby was undecided how to act. If
Williams had remained alone he would have gone to him and
explained the shot. If Gerald had joined the detective, he would
have joined them. But the strange action of the secretary warned
him that some new act in a strange drama was now to be played. He
decided to watch.</p>

<p>He had seen Gerald but a couple of hours previously in the
bush, with Myrtle. She had left him and he had turned back,
presumably returning to Madlands. In that case Gerald had known
that the detective was in the house. Possibly he had spent some
time with him that day? Did Williams know that Myrtle was free
and in hiding?</p>

<p>The Inspector was walking about the dining room searching for
some signs of the intruder. At length he found the fresh bullet
hole in the wainscoting, behind the head of the table. It puzzled
him and he probed the hole with his pen-knife. At length, he gave
an exclamation of satisfaction and picked up some article from
the floor. For a few seconds he stood, examining it, then placing
it in the pocket of his pyjama jacket, be came towards the
door.</p>

<p>Bobby drew back. If Gerald did not want the detective to catch
him watching him he would have to retreat. That would bring him
near to Bobby, and until the secretary's inexplicable actions
were solved the newspaperman did not want to reveal himself.
Going back behind the pillar the journalist resigned himself to a
patient watch.</p>

<p>The Inspector lingered in the room a few moments longer, then
came to the door. He turned and switched off the lights. Bobby heard the door close, then an angry exclamation, followed by the
sounds of a heavy fall. He sprung forward tugging the torch from
his pocket. As he touched the trigger someone collided with his
arm and the torch fell on the ground.</p>

<p>Bobby swore as be groped on the ground for the torch. Almost
as his fingers touched it he was caught by the neck and flung to
the ground. A jerk and he brought his assailant down on top of
himself. For some minutes they struggled in the darkness.</p>

<p>The blow on the head he had received in the grounds of Treview
had sapped the journalist's strength. He found himself forced
back, his assailant straddling his chest. He felt himself lifted
from the floor and dashed down. His head came in contact with the
edge of the stairway and he became insensible.</p>

<p><br> "DAMNED good you've got a hard crust."</p>

<p>Bobby opened his eyes to find Inspector Williams bending over
him.</p>

<p>"What the hell you wanted to attack me like that for, I can't
understand. Were you the burglar in the dining room?"</p>

<p>"Attack you?" The newspaperman laughed weakly. "Wasn't it
<i>you</i> who attacked <i>me</i>&mdash;as I was coming to your
rescue?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you trip me up as I came out of the dining-room?"
retorted the detective.</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" Bobby looked around the lit hall. "Where
is he?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Gerald Preston."</p>

<p>"Was he down here?"</p>

<p>"He was standing in the dining room door while you searched
the room."</p>

<p>"What was he doing there?"</p>

<p>"Search me!"</p>

<p>"Was it he who tripped me as I came out of the room?" The
detective hesitated, then continued. "Say, Trayne, you're putting
up a funny tale. What are you doing here tonight? Who fired that
shot in the dining-room?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to discover." Bobby grinned. "I was in the
dining room when someone fired at me. Luckily I had bent down to
pick up something from on the carpet when the shot came."</p>

<p>"Who fired the shot?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, that's what I want to know." For some
seconds the journalist was silent; then: "I've got
suspicions."</p>

<p>"Whoever it was went out of the window," observed the
detective, "the window was open."</p>

<p>"That's how I got in," the newspaperman grinned, "I'm not
puzzled about that, it's what happened to Gerald Preston that's
puzzling me."</p>

<p>"Who called me?" A voice from the stairs spoke.</p>

<p>The men looked up. Half-way down the stairs Gerald Preston was
bending over the rail, looking down on them.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Bobby?" Gerald spoke lightly. "You look as if you'd
been in the wars. What's the trouble, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Only burglars, Mr. Preston." Williams answered shortly. "Mr.
Trayne thought you'd been down here and wondered if you'd been in
the mix-up."</p>

<p>"Down there?" Gerald slowly descended the stairs. "No, I
heard a commotion, in the hall, and, came down to see what was
the matter."</p>

<p>"You mean, to say this is the first time you've come
downstairs tonight?" Bobby tried to conceal his amazement.</p>

<p>"Just that!" Gerald spoke indifferently. "Why so astonished,
Bobby? If you and the Inspector are going to indulge in rough and
tumble in the hall you must expect to wake sleepers up. I thought
something serious had happened."</p>

<p>"You say you have just come out of your room." Bobby spoke
incredulously.</p>

<p>"I say that Keston came to me a few minutes ago and waked me
to come downstairs with him. When he opened my door I could hear
that a fight was in progress and we came down together. Never
expected to find that it was you and the Inspector. Who won,
Bobby?"</p>

<p>Bobby rubbed his head. Had he been dreaming, when he saw
Gerald follow the Inspector down the stairs? Yet there was the
butler nodding confirmation or the secretary's statements.</p>

<p>"I've been around the district, investigating, most of the
evening," The newspaperman answered slowly. "Went as far as
Treview and butted my head against a young tree. Don't think
Inspector Williams would have had so easy a victory if I'd been
fit."</p>

<p>The newspaperman watched Gerald Preston's face as he spoke of
Treview; but the secretary did not show any signs of
agitation.</p>

<p>"Did you go to the cottage, Trayne?" asked Inspector Williams
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and found a couple of interesting gentlemen in
possession." Bobby laughed. "Oh, I've had plenty of excitements,
believe me. Say, Keston, can you fit me with a bed? I don't feel
like getting back to the city just at present."</p>

<p>"Better have a spot before you go up," suggested Williams.
"Come into the dining-room, Trayne, I want a word with you."</p>

<p>A short nod from the detective dismissed the others. He caught
the newspaperman's arm and led him into the drawing-room, closing
the door carefully after them.</p>

<p>"Now, Bobby, what's the tale?" Williams spoke as he brought a
stiff brandy and soda to where the journalist was sitting,
"You've got quite a story to tell, if I know anything."</p>

<p>"And there's not a connecting link between the incidents." The
strong spirits made the journalist gasp, and set the blood
coursing through, his worn body. "First, let me have a look at
that bullet you dug out of the wainscoting."</p>

<p>The Inspector put his hand in his pyjama-jacket
pocket&mdash;to withdraw it empty. The bullet had
disappeared.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a full minute Inspector Williams fumbled in
the pocket of his pyjama suit, in vain; then turned and stared
blankly at the journalist. Suddenly he sprang to the door and
wrenched it open.</p>

<p>"The torch, Bobby!" He ran into the hall and switched on the
light. "I've got to have that bullet. Where the devil&mdash;I
suppose it dropped out of my pocket when that door banged to on me."</p>

<p>Bobby levered himself from his chair and carried the torch
into the hall. For some time they searched, without result.</p>

<p>"Give it up, Williams." Bobby straightened himself with a
groan. "We know now what that chap was after."</p>

<p>"The bullet?" The detective frowned. "What's the good of it to
him?"</p>

<p>"Prevent you comparing it with the bullet the doctor took from
Sir Rupert's breast."</p>

<p>"And then? You think the bullets are from the same gun?"</p>

<p>"Must be. What would be the use stealing the bullet you found
a half-hour ago if they weren't?" Bobby grinned. "Say, he's got
pluck! Wonder if he knew I was just behind him?"</p>

<p>"If you hadn't been&mdash;" Williams turned and led into the
dining-room again. "Say, Bobby, who was it?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easier!" The newspaperman wandered around
the room. "What I am worrying about is, who wants to out me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're getting to know too much." The Inspector
grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm dense." Bobby was probing the hole in the
wainscoting with his finger. "Know too much! There seems to be
little I don't know, but how to fit it together and what's
missing I can't even guess at."</p>

<p>Searching his pockets the journalist pulled out a pencil and a
wad of copy paper. Chewing some of the paper to pulp, he thrust
the pencil in the bullet-hole and plugged it into place, taking
care that the pencil was exactly central to the hole. Then he
went the other end of the room and focused the pencil until he
had the end showing as a disc. He backed slowly, keeping in exact
line with the pencil, until he came in collision with the small
table at which he had been seated at the time of Sir Rupert's
death.</p>

<p>"Illuminating, eh?" The Inspector grinned.</p>

<p>"Wonder you don't arrest me!" Bobby turned from the table and
drew a chair to the place he had occupied just before the shot
was fired. He sat down&mdash;to jump to his feet,
immediately.</p>

<p>"Look here, Williams. That pencil's only in alignment when I'm
standing."</p>

<p>"You didn't rise to your feel before the shot was fired?"</p>

<p>"No. Yes, I did! Something seemed to warn me there was danger
about, I thought it was to Myrtle&mdash;Miss Haffervale, and
jumped to her side, to hold her down in her chair."</p>

<p>"Then you weren't in the chair when the shot was fired? Do
you remember exactly where you were?"</p>

<p>"About here." Bobby walked up the room and drew a chair to the
big table, kneeling beside it. "Yes, I remember. I was on my
knees, holding her down when the shot came."</p>

<p>"Who was at that table?" The Inspector pointed to the little
table by the door.</p>

<p>"Gerald."</p>

<p>"Again!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He was at the door, you say, when I went to get out, just
now?"</p>

<p>"He came from upstairs later, followed by Keston," Bobby
suggested.</p>

<p>"How many minutes after you and I came to grips? I forgot. You
went out!" The Inspector laughed. "Well, I'm telling you. I
reckon it took fully ten minutes for Mr. Gerald Preston to get
down to us. Give another five minutes for me to awaken on hearing
the shot, get down and search the room&mdash;that's all of a
quarter of an hour. Shouldn't have taken Keston all that time to
arouse Gerald and escort him down here. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But sufficient time for Gerald to get that bullet from you,
bolt upstairs to his room and pretend to be just awakening when
Keston knocked." Bobby nodded.</p>

<p>Again the Inspector circled the room, peering inquisitively at
every article of furniture, tapping the wainscoting with the butt
of his gun. He found nothing and returned, frowning, to where the
journalist sat watching him.</p>

<p>"What next?" The journalist enquired.</p>

<p>"Bed, I think." The detective turned to the door. "Don't
suppose there'll be more shooting tonight. Ready, Bobby?"</p>

<p>The newspaperman rose, wearily to his feet. He wanted to
sleep. Twice that night he had been knocked out. His head ached,
infernally. Yet the problems before him kept him alert. Again, he
crossed the room to the small table and sat down.</p>

<p>"Look here, Williams," he exclaimed, "You think Gerald fired
that shot. But he was sitting here when I passed him to go to
Myr&mdash;Miss Haffervale."</p>

<p>"Certain?"</p>

<p>"If he was sitting he could not have fired that shot." The
journalist continued his reconstruction. "You say the doctor
reported that the bullet took a downward course."</p>

<p>"Umph!"</p>

<p>"Another thing." Bobby, rose to his feet. "That bullet must
have passed directly over Lord Carriday's head."</p>

<p>"Preston was on his feet." The detective spoke
emphatically.</p>

<p>"You're sure?"</p>

<p>"Stands to reason," Williams explained. "You were watching
Sir Rupert when something tugged your suggestion that a
catastrophe was about to happen. You sprang from your chair to go
to the girl. Now, if Preston was sitting where you have placed
that chair you would have tumbled over him. As it was I noted,
when I first came here, that you said that you pushed him to one
side, as you rushed forward. That means that he was on his
feet."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn!" Bobby laughed. "Still, Williams, we've reduced
your suspects by one. There's only Gerald and Carri&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something caused the journalist to swing round and face the
window. For a moment he stared blankly, at the darkened glass,
then sprang forward with a shout. Blindly, Williams followed him.
He caught up to Bobby on the terrace.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, man?"</p>

<p>"There was a man at the window." The newspaperman was
searching the grounds with keen eyes. "Man with his hat pulled
over his eyes; looked as if he had a long cloak wrapped around
him, buttoned up tight to his throat. One side of the cloak was
thrown back, over his shoulder and he had a gun in his hand,
pointed at you through the glass&mdash;a gun with a queer bulge
on the muzzle."</p>

<p>"A gun covered with a silencer," the detective interpreted.
"That's interesting, but it doesn't explain that whirling noise
you heard before the shot was fired at you."</p>

<p>"But the shot that was fired at me wasn't fired through a
silencer." Bobby pretested.</p>

<p>"Well, he's gone now, whoever he was."</p>

<p>The detective turned back to the room. "Come on, man, we'd
best get to bed."</p>

<p>Bobby followed reluctantly, turning back at the window to
again, search the grounds. The man must be somewhere about; he
could not have gone far. From the moment when he had seen him
peering in through the window to the time when he rushed out onto
the terrace was too short for the man to have got far away from
the house. Where had he gone to?</p>

<p>With one foot in the room Bobby turned again and strode out on
to the terrace, going to the stone balustrade and peering over.
With keen eyes he swept the long line of terrace, now silent and
deserted. A sudden thought and he walked along the wall of the
house, testing each window. They were all fastened.</p>

<p>"Come on, Bobby," Williams called, impatiently.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, the newspaperman started to obey. He had only
taken but a dozen steps when a hoarse, terror-stricken cry came
from down the garden.</p>

<p>Someone was in the grounds. Bobby ran to the stone steps,
following the detective down to the gardens. On the turf Williams
halted, peering inquisitively around him.</p>

<p>"You heard it, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere down towards the water." The detective took a step
forward and halted. "Why the devil doesn't he cry again?"</p>

<p>It was useless to wander forward through the darkness,
following the clue of a single cry. It might have come from
anywhere in the grounds. Bobby flashed the light from his torch
around. To his left ran a path&mdash;he believed it ran down to
the old sundial. Instinctively he moved in that direction, the
Inspector following. Almost as his feet crushed the gravel the
cry came again.</p>

<p>It was a cry of pain, almost inhuman in expression of intense
agony. It rang through the still night air with terrible
terseness.</p>

<p>"Down the path!"</p>

<p>Williams, his bedroom slippers flapping grotesquely on his
heels passed Bobby, racing down to the old sundial. The
journalist followed, waving his light from side to side.</p>

<p>They came to the sundial and halted. Bobby swept the light
over the flower-beds, but there were no signs of anyone about.
Here the path branched in three directions; the one directly
before them leading down to the cliffs. To the right was the path
they had followed when they went from the sundial to the
gardener's cottage. The remaining path probably led to the little
gully in which the assistant gardeners had been working on the
day of Sir Rupert's death.</p>

<p>Which road should they take? Bobby waited, listening intently.
If only the man would call again; but only the soft lapping of
the waves at the foot of the cliffs broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Man over the cliffs," Williams guessed. "Come along and keep
that light on the path; I don't want to follow him over in the
dark."</p>

<p>For nearly a hundred yards they ran at breakneck pace through
the night; then Bobby gave a cry of warning. The path was
inclining upward abruptly; they were at the head of the
cliffs.</p>

<p>Before them rose the outline of a small building. It showed
black against the luminous soft light that overhung the rippling
waters of the ocean. Williams again took the lead, making for the
hut. A few yards before it he stopped, with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>Bobby peered forward, held in sudden terror. A wraith-like
white-robed figure came from the building and glided to the edge
of the cliffs. For some seconds it appeared to hang there, then
bent forward&mdash;and disappeared.</p>

<p>Williams passed the hut, running to the edge of the cliff,
followed by Bobby, now released from his sudden terror at the
appearance of the wraith. He threw himself down on the turf and
flashed the light down the face of the cliffs. There was nothing
to be seen save the bare water-washed rocks. Reluctantly they
turned to the building. The door was swinging idly in the breeze.
Williams pushed it back and entered.</p>

<p>"What's that?" the torch-light showed an ungainly, dark bundle
lying in the middle of the floor. The Inspector rolled it over. A
man's face came into the circle of light.</p>

<p>"God, man!" Bobby spoke in a whisper. "That's Carruthers;
Ibbotson's pet private detective!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">"HE'S had a terrible smash on the head."
Inspector Williams knelt by the unconscious man, scanning the
livid bruise by the light of his torch.</p>

<p>"Now who whanged him?"</p>

<p>Bobby did not answer. He was staring through the door, out
into the night over the edge of the cliff. What had been the
meaning of the wraith-like shadow that had come from the building
to float out over the edge of the cliff&mdash;to nowhere? Had the
shape been but a figment of his imagination. No, the journalist
knew that the detective had seen the figure also. Then too, there
were no such things as ghosts. The shadow had been a real
person.</p>

<p>He shook himself roughly. Why should he be thinking of ghosts
when Carruthers lay insensible, perhaps dying, inside the hut?
The man had been stricken down by some material weapon, not a
ghostly hand. Who, then, had been in the hut with him? What had
been the reason for that mortal cry of terror that had reached to
the terrace of the big house?</p>

<p>"Give me a hand, Bobby." Williams spoke curtly. "He's coming
round and we'd better get him up to the house as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>Without speaking the journalist stepped back into the hut to
the side of the private detective and helped raise him to his
feet. The man, though conscious now, could hardly stand.</p>

<p>Half-dragging, half-carrying him, they came at length to the
house and to the room Keston had prepared for Bobby. Leaving the
detective to drag off the man's clothing, the journalist went to
the library and rang up the local doctor, asking him to call
immediately. He returned to the bedroom to find Williams seated
by the semi-conscious man, a puzzled frown on his brow.</p>

<p>"This case beats me, Bobby." The Inspector spoke abruptly. "I
thought I had a line on it this morning&mdash;but this&mdash;" He
pointed to the man on the bed. "This beats me."</p>

<p>"Carruthers is Ibbotson's private detective," said the
journalist abruptly.</p>

<p>"And that means?" The Inspector queried.</p>

<p>"Does Ibbotson's dirty work and looks after his personal
safety."</p>

<p>"You're not suggesting that Ibbotson clumped him on the head?"
Williams spoke almost roughly.</p>

<p>"He did me, tonight."</p>

<p>"What?" The detective swung round to face the journalist. "You
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you." In a few terse words the newspaperman told
of his adventures during the early hours of the night. Williams
listened in undisguised amazement.</p>

<p>"Then the whole mystery centres about that girl!" he
ejaculated when the newspaperman paused. "But where is she? Say,
Bobby," he paused a moment. "Do you remember seeing some
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something!" corrected the journalist.</p>

<p>"Well, 'something,' if you like." Williams spoke
impatiently.</p>

<p>"'Something' come out of that summer-house and disappear over
the cliff?"</p>

<p>"You're not suggesting anything," the detective interrupted
angrily. "The affair's got me fogged. Why were you shot at
tonight? Why was Carruthers struck down in the
summer-house&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why was he at the window a few minutes before, with a gun in
his hand, pointed at you? Why was someone else so anxious that
you should not keep the bullet they fired at me? Why is everyone
connected with Sir Rupert Haffervale's death sitting in at some
independent game?" completed the journalist. Then, after a pause,
he added, "Get rid of the sidelines, Williams. Find out who was
responsible for the shooting of Sir Rupert Haffervale and the
rest of the story will fall into line, almost automatically."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," the Inspector mused. "Yet, I
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shrill clamour of the door-bell caused them to spring to
their feet. Bobby ran down the stairs to the front door and
admitted the doctor. Guiding him to the room where Carruthers
lay, he went in to the corridor and paced up and down, in deep
thought, until Williams joined him.</p>

<p>"Getting on all right," reported the detective moodily. "But
he's not to talk yet. Dr. Martingale proposes to remain with him
until daybreak, so we'd better get to bed."</p>

<p>Through the remaining hours of the night Bobby tossed
restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p><br> WITH the first beams of the new day he rose and went
along the corridor to the room where they had carried Carruthers
the previous night. At the door he met the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Conscious."</p>

<p>"Said anything?"</p>

<p>"Darned little." Williams smiled grimly: "While the doctor was
out of the room for a few seconds, I asked him who had struck him
down and he said he didn't know. Then I asked him why he had
tried to shoot me through the dining-room window and he denied
that he had been on the terrace."</p>

<p>"Denied it?" Bobby whistled, astonished. "But&mdash;damn it, I
saw him."</p>

<p>"You saw someone." The Inspector shook his head with a little
laugh. "Now think, Bobby. Didn't you notice that Carruthers
hadn't an overcoat with him in the summer-house&mdash;that there
wasn't anything like the cloak you described anywhere about?"</p>

<p>"He could have got rid of it between the house and the
cliffs," objected the journalist.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Williams nodded. "Directly the gardeners show up in
the grounds I'll have a search made. Take it from me, if I find
a cloak or anything like it about, Mr. Interfering Carruthers
will have a hell of a lot of explaining to do. I'll have him just
where I want him!"</p>

<p>The detective turned back into the sick room, leaving the
newspaper man waiting, hesitatingly, in the corridor. At length,
with a shrug of his shoulders, Bobby strolled to the stairs, and
descended into the great hall. Instinctively, his steps turned
towards the dining-room, the scene of the complex mysteries
surrounding the death of Sir Rupert Haffervale. For a few moments
he stood in the doorway, surveying the now familiar scene, a
puzzled frown on his brows, then turned to the windows and passed
out on the terrace.</p>

<p>Again he halted, scanning the scene before him with keen,
anxious eyes. It was barely daybreak, and over the sea to the
east slowly spread the first faint flush of dawn. Shrugging his
shoulders the newspaperman descended to the lawns and strolled
towards the head of the cliffs.</p>

<p>He was certain that somewhere around the quaint stone
structure on the cliffs&mdash;he had named it the summer-house
for want of a better title&mdash;he would find the solution of
the mystery of the previous night. Pausing for a moment to watch
around and see that he was not observed, he pushed open the
swinging door of the hut and entered.</p>

<p>The room was octagonal in shape, not more than ten feet across
its widest area. On the roughly boarded floor stood three chairs
and a small round table. The windows, fitted with casement
frames, were on the sides; the wall opposite the door, and
backing towards the old house, showed neither window nor door.
Immediately behind the door hung a small cabinet, the door
locked. On the wall, on the opposite side of the door, hung the
telephone.</p>

<p>A few minutes work with his penknife and the door of the
cabinet swung open to the journalist's pull; in it was crowded a
mass of thin black material. Bobby pulled it out and shook it
open. It was a wide, loose cloak. From within it something
dropped to the floor. Bobby picked it up, staring at it
curiously. For a full minute he frowned at it,
perplexed&mdash;then laughed. It was a black, silk fringed
mask.</p>

<p>For a long time Bobby stood in the doorway of the hut, the
cloak over his arm, the mask in his hand, gazing over the-waters
of the bay, pondering the problem. Who had placed the cloak and
mask in the cabinet in the hut?</p>

<p>The obvious answer was Carruthers, but if so, had he done so
before someone had crept up to him, to stun him with some blunt
instrument. Or, had the wearer of the cloak and mask been hiding
in the hut when Carruthers arrived and had struck him down to
secure his escape?</p>

<p>With a shrug of his shoulders and a light laugh, Bobby put the
problem from him. Rolling up the cloak and mask in as small a
compass as possible, he thrust them into the cabinet again and
wedged the broken door shut. If the Inspector wanted them, he
could go there to find them.</p>

<p>Why had Carruthers come to the hut? Had he come there to meet
some person? Then, that person could only be Ibbotson, his
employer. But, Bobby knew he had left the tobacco magnate at
Treview the previous evening, but a couple of hours before
Carruthers had been struck down in the hut on the cliff.</p>

<p>Whichever way he turned the problem the facts would not fit.
With an impatient shrug, Bobby turned to leave the hut. His eyes
fell on the telephone&mdash;and he whistled lowly.</p>

<p>Had Carruthers come to the house to get in touch with someone?
Had he fled from the house on finding himself observed, when he
peered in at the window? Had he come to the hut on the cliffs to
telephone someone at Madlands? There would be a reasonable
explanation of the private detective's actions&mdash;even taking
into belief his direct denial to Williams that he had been on the
terrace the previous night.</p>

<p>The telephone was of the wall-pattern, yet somewhat unlike the
usual machine. It possessed the usual desk, but there was no
calling handle; just above the desk was a press-button. Bobby
lifted the receiver and pressed the button. He waited some time
but there was no reply.</p>

<p>Very carefully the journals examined the telephone. Under the
box desk he found a three-ways switch. At the time the connection
was resting on the centre stud. He shifted the arm of the first
stud and again pressed the call-button. A short wait and a voice
he knew answered.</p>

<p>"That Keston?" Bobby asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Keston speaking, from Madlands."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know where I am calling from then&mdash;the hut on
the cliffs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Right! Will you get Inspector Williams to this telephone, at
once, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Will you be so good as to hold the line for a
moment, sir."</p>

<p>A short wait and then the Inspector's deep voice came over the
wire.</p>

<p>"That you, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Yes; speaking from the hut on the cliff. Say, Williams, has
Carruthers any keys with him?"</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Bobby interrupted. "I'm speaking from the hut on
the cliff. New South Wales, Australia not your native country. I
want information about Carruthers' keys."</p>

<p>"Well, well." There was a laughing drawl in the detective's
voice. "You're in luck. As it happens, I got curious this morning
and took the liberty of searching friend Carruthers' pockets. For
your information I may say that he had nothing in the nature of a
key on him."</p>

<p>"So!" Bobby grinned delightedly. He had expected a similar
answer.</p>

<p>"Doesn't that strike you as funny? Perhaps he dropped them
somewhere&mdash;anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"A private detective without keys!" Bobby mocked. "Can you
visualise a private detective without a cloak and a dark
lantern&mdash;then, possibly, also keys, eh?"</p>

<p>"What's the game?" There, was keen suspicion in the
Inspector's voice. "Found anything, Bobby? Where are you speaking
from?"</p>

<p>"The hut on the cliff; I told you a minute, ago. Quite an
interesting place. Tell you all about it when I get home for
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Don't get another bash on the head, Bobby. Three in a dozen
hours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No chance, old dear," Bobby scoffed. "It's morning and I'm
wide awake. Again, I happen to know where all the sleep-drenched
official police are. So long, old man. I'm coming up to the house
now. Tell Keston that I'm hungry, and if breakfast isn't ready
I'll hand him over to you."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and waited. Now he would have to act
quickly. If he knew Williams, the detective, would by this time
be on the road to the hut on the cliff&mdash;and before he
arrived there Bobby wanted to complete his inquiries and be
away.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had acted hastily in calling Williams to the
telephone, but he had been surprised&mdash;perhaps taken
aback&mdash;when Keston answered the call. Now he had to discover
where the other two lines of communications led, if indeed there
were others than the house line leading from the telephone
instrument in the hut.</p>

<p>With the end of the switch-arm on the first stud he was in
communication with Madlands. With what places did the studs two
and three connect?&mdash;or were they blanks? But, if they did
not connect the instrument with other lines, why the switch on
the instrument?</p>

<p>Again he scrutinised the switch, this time by the light of his
torch. The switch was new&mdash;much newer than the telephone; he
was certain it had been placed there some time after the
instrument had been erected. He went out of the hut and looked up
at the roof. Only one line led from the hut&mdash;in the
direction of the big house.</p>

<p>Only one line led from then hut. Then, if there were other
lines passing from the hut, they must lead away underground.</p>

<p>Bobby shrugged as he re-entered the hut. He had yet to
discover that there were other lines leading to the switch. Again
he brought his torch into play, minutely scanning the woodwork
around the instrument.</p>

<p>The wire that led from the telephone to Madlands ran up the
wainscoting and through the roof. Another wire led from the
switch to the ground&mdash;evidently the earthed wire. Taking out
his penknife Bobby scraped this wire, to discover if, within the
insulating material, was more than one wire. He found the line
contained only the earthed wire.</p>

<p>Again he scanned the wainscoting of the hut immediately about
the telephone instrument. A few minutes and he found that certain
of the boards had been recently removed and replaced. A search of
the flooring and he found that one of the boards had been lifted
and re-laid with meticulous care; dusted with dirt, carefully
rubbed in.</p>

<p>So, two wires led from the telephone underground. The
newspaperman felt in his pocket for some instrument with which to
wrench off the wainscoting boards. He had nothing except his
penknife. Then, he would have to go to the house to get some
tool&mdash;and he did not want to meet the Inspector until he had
a full story to tell.</p>

<p>Yet he could not discover the secret of the telephone unless
he had tools. He would have to go to the house. He shrugged and
swung on his heels&mdash;to halt in surprise. The telephone bell
was ringing softly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">AGAIN the telephone bell rang; quickly and
mildly, with a quaint hint of secretiveness in its tones. Bobby
turned to face the instrument, a look of indecision in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Who was ringing the hut on the cliffs? Possibly the call was
from Williams. He might have thought of some fresh questions he
wanted answered; he might have some information gathered from
Carruthers.</p>

<p>No, the latter was not likely. The Inspector would hardly have
had time to get to the private detective's room and back to the
telephone.</p>

<p>For the third time the bell rang; now with a hint of
impatience in its tone. A broad grin came on Bobby's lips. He
turned from the instrument with a negative shake or his head.</p>

<p>He had other matters of more moment than answering fool
questions, asked over the telephone wire. Myrtle was living
somewhere in the neighbourhood. That much he had gathered from
her during the few minutes she had been with him in the glade,
after Ibbotson's assaults on him at Treview. Did one of the wires
he believed led from this instrument go to her hiding-place. In
that case had she rang the bell?</p>

<p>No. Bobby could answer that question decisively. Myrtle would
not ring up the hut on the cliffs. She would realise that her
enemies were prowling about the grounds at Madlands. Even if she
had friends about the house, she would not use that means of
communication. It was far too dangerous.</p>

<p>But he must trace those hidden wires. Some instinct warned him
that somewhere in their sinuous length he would come to the girl
he sought; to the heart of the mystery surrounding the death of
her uncle and his fortune.</p>

<p>He dared not return to the house for tools! Yet, all he had on
him was his heavy-bladed pocket knife. He pulled it out and
tested the big blade. It was stout and of fine steel; it should
serve.</p>

<p>The wainscoting below the telephone proved of soft wood and
the keen blade bit easily into it. A few minutes and he had
prised a fair-sized hole in the wood. Now he could break out
larger pieces of the wood! In five minutes he had a jagged hole,
extending almost the width of the board. He shone the light from
his torch into the hole.</p>

<p>He had guessed correctly. Down the wall of the hut, behind the
wainscoting, ran two wires. They disappeared below the level of
the flooring. A minute's hesitation and the journalist went out
of the hut and started to dig away the earth close against the
outer wall and as near as he could guess, immediately under the
telephone. Almost immediately he came across a small iron tube.
Digging along the line of the tube he found, some two feet from
the wall of the hut that it branched, one section going towards
the edge of the cliff, the other bending inland to pass the
corner of the hut.</p>

<p>Bobby decided, after a little reflection, to follow the line
leading inland. He moved a few yards in the direction he supposed
the tubing to take, then dug down again. It was some moments
before he again found the tube. He straightened, with a scowl.
Progress with his pen-knife was too slow. He must find some tool
to work with.</p>

<p>He went up the path to the sundial, watching keenly on every
side. Just before he reached the joining paths he found a fork
stuck in the soil under the ornamental tree. He seized it
eagerly. Now he had a tool that would permit him to proceed with
some speed.</p>

<p>The line of tubing led towards a small plantation of trees,
bordering the boundary of the estate. Just within the plantation
he missed the tubing and it was several minutes before he located
it again. Now he found the telephone line coming out of the earth
and climbing into the branches of a tree. It was looped from tree
to tree until, at the boundary fence, it descended to one of the
posts and followed the fencing wires in the direction of the
roadway.</p>

<p>Bobby's face flamed with excitement. He was guessing to where
the line would lead him. He came to the main road and looked
around. A line of poles, bearing the Madlands telephone wires
came up to the fence. One of the poles was on the line of fencing
and here the secret wire climbed the pole. Yet, but a single wire
crossed the road to the public telephone post on the other side
of the highway; a single wire, but of heavy insulation.</p>

<p>The newspaperman crossed the road and examined the pole. As he
had guessed, a wire came down from the height of the post and
passed to the fence bounding the grounds around the gardener's
cottage. At the foot of one or the fencing posts the wire entered
the ground, in an iron tube. Bobby whistled and straightened;
then made direct for the cottage. Close to the earth, under the
sitting room window, he found where the wire entered the
cottage.</p>

<p>He glanced up. From the high-road a line of poles came,
bearing a single wire. Now he remembered seeing a telephone in
the cottage. But with the wire he had discovered entering the
cottage on the ground level, there must be two telephone
instruments in the cottage; and he had only seen one.</p>

<p>A few minutes' search in the sitting-room and he located the
secret wire. Now it was easy, to trace up to the instrument. He
found it under a concealed trap-door in the kitchen. For some
minutes he stood gazing down at the instrument. Now he understood
why the man the two crooks had come to meet at the cottage had
not kept his appointment.</p>

<p>He lifted the instrument from the secret cupboard&mdash;to
place it on the floor with a little gasp of astonishment. It was
a pedestal instrument. On the base was a call button and a two
ways switch. He flashed his light on the hole. Yes, there were
two wires leading out of the compartment. One led to the hut on
the cliff. Where did the other lead to?</p>

<p>A few minutes search in the grounds surrounding the cottage
and Bobby read the secret. The second wire led through the bush
in the direction of Treview.</p>

<p>For some time Bobby paced the path from the cottage to the
road, puzzling over the problem of the telephone wires. Who had
laid them&mdash;and for what reason? Madlands and Treview were
connected with the public telephone system; yet, between the two
houses lay a secret system, passing, by way of the hut on the
cliffs, and the abandoned gardener's cottage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bobby shouldered the gardener's fork he had brought
to the cottage and retraced his steps to the hut on the cliffs.
In his mind there was a glimmer of a solution of the problem of
the secret telephone. But, before he could be confident he had
the correct solution he had to discover to where the third wire
from the hut on the cliff led.</p>

<p>A few minutes work and Bobby discovered that the third wire
led to the edge of the cliffs. About ten feet from the hut it
dipped steeply into the earth. Raking out the soil from around
the iron tubing, the newspaperman found that the wire followed
into a fissure in the rocks.</p>

<p>Going to the edge of the cliff, Bobby peered down the face of
rock. The fissure in the rock extended down the cliff for some
distance. He was certain that the wire followed the fissure, but
to where? He would have to get a rope to follow it. The previous
night he and the Inspector had witnessed some white-clothed
figure pass from the hut to the edge of the cliffs and disappear.
Had the wraith-like figure been human? Bobby was too
materialistic to believe in ghosts, in spite of the involuntary
shudder that had seized him on first seeing the figure. No, it had been some human being; someone who had found a way down the
cliffs.</p>

<p>Four feet down the cliffs, a point of rock jutted out. It
would be easy to get on to that rock, but from where he lay the
newspaperman could not see any further means of descending. Still
there might be one. Wriggling around he dropped down to the rock;
and crouched there, scanning his surroundings.</p>

<p>There was a way. A little to the right, and under a bulge of
rock that concealed it from the fop of the cliffs, was a small
platform and from it ran a faint, rough path, descending towards
the water. Scrambling and slithering on the smooth rock, Bobby
followed the faint track, noting that it bore signs of having
been used recently.</p>

<p>Just above the high water mark he came to a small cave, in
which the track ended. He looked, up; yes, the trail was
practical, even for a girl.</p>

<p>Pulling his torch out of his pocket, Bobby entered the cave.
It was narrow and the roof low for some twenty yards. Then the
roof heightened and the walls fell apart. Exultantly, the
newspaperman strode on. A sharp angle and he found himself
standing at the entrance of a large, lofty cavern.</p>

<p>He looked around him, by the light of his torch,
inquisitively. The cavern was empty, yet showed signs of human
habitation. Against the rough rock walls were the remains of
substantial shelving. In a far corner was a heap of rubbish that,
when he examined it, proved to be the remains of old casks.
Curiously, the journalist circled the cavern, pausing at one spot
to examine it with care where some of the old wood showed signs
of having been recently broken.</p>

<p>In a far corner, he found a narrow opening, leading inland.
Waving the light of his torch before him Bobby entered the
opening. As he progressed, the floor rose steadily. At fifty
yards, and on his right-hand, he found another opening. Entering
it, the first thing the light of his torch rested on was a
telephone.</p>

<p>The cave was small, barely twelve feet square. On one side
stood a stretcher bed. On it was a mattress and bed-clothing,
neatly arranged.</p>

<p>Close to the foot at the bed was a large packing-case and on
it a mirror and some toilet articles. At the other end of the
cave stood another packing case and on it an oil-stove and an
array of cooking utensils.</p>

<p>Bobby barely restrained a shout. He had found Myrtle's
hiding-place. But, where was the girl? Again he circled the cave.
He was certain the girl had recently occupied it.</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of the bed and tried to think. Should
he wait there until Myrtle returned? If he did, would she take
him into her confidence and let him help her? She had promised
to do so, when she made the appointment to meet him at the
sundial, immediately after Sir Rupert's death. But, as she had
not kept that appointment, she had left him alone in the glade
outside Treview. Had she repented of her promised confidence?</p>

<p>A sudden restlessness seized him. He went into the
cave-passage and swept his light to and fro. The passage led on,
past Myrtle's cave, still sloping upwards. To where did it
lead?</p>

<p>Bobby tried to think back over his wanderings in the cave. He
believed he was not far from Madlands. Would this passage lead
him to the big house? He believed so. If it did then the secret
that had baffled him for so long was almost within his grasp.</p>

<p>Moving forward, guided by the waning light of his torch, Bobby
strode up the passage. The ground sloped steeply, until the
newspaperman thought that but few feet must separate him from the
surface. Suddenly he turned a corner, almost at right angles, and
found himself facing a rock wall.</p>

<p>For some full minute he stood, failure tugging at his heart.
Had he penetrated so far into the earth below Madlands to
discover he had been on a fool's quest? Doggedly, he flashed his
light around the passage end. A slight exclamation passed his
compressed lips. In one corner dangled a rope. He sprang forward
and jerked it, roughly.</p>

<p>Something heavy and hard struck him on the back, pitching him
against the rocky wall. The torch dropped from his nerveless hand
as he staggered back, now bumping into some solid wooden
structure. He grasped at it, dazed and almost helpless from the
shock.</p>

<p>Who had assaulted him? For long moments he stood, listening
intently. Gradually his brain cleared. There was no one with him
in the cavern.</p>

<p>He laughed, loudly, feeling at the wooden structure he was
holding on to. It had not been there before. He was certain of
that. Then, where had it come from?</p>

<p>He felt in his pockets and found a match. His first glance was
at the wooden structure&mdash;and he gasped. It was a ladder,
leading up into the shadows of the cavern roof. He glanced around
for his torch; it lay almost at his feet. Picking it up he
pressed the trigger. Luckily it had not broken. Guided by the
feeble light he mounted the ladder, to find himself in a narrow
passage. A few yards forward he came up against a door.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before he heard voices on the other
side.</p>

<p>Again he hesitated, trying to listen, but the wood was too
thick to convey more than the faintest sounds. Holding the door
carefully, he pressed the spring, allowing the door to open but a
fraction of an inch. Cautiously he peered through the
opening.</p>

<p>He was staring into the morning room at Madlands. The table
was set for an early breakfast and at its head sat a young girl,
a manservant standing beside her, talking lowly and earnestly.
Bobby gasped in astonishment. Myrtle Haffervale had returned to
her home.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some moments Bobby stood behind the
partially-opened secret door in the wainscoting watching Myrtle
and Keston. The butler was evidently conveying news that
distressed and displeased the girl.</p>

<p>The newspaperman glanced down at his watch. It was barely
seven o'clock, far too early for any of the usual Madlands
residents to think of breakfast. Then, this was a special meal. A
slight smile came on his lips. He was beginning to understand
much.</p>

<p>Keston finished his report and asked a question. Myrtle shook
her head and the butler, with a slight bow, moved towards the
door. For some seconds after the man had passed from the room
the girl sat frowning thoughtfully at her plate: then pushed it
from her and let her head fall suddenly into her hands.</p>

<p>Bobby allowed the secret door to fly back into place and
stepped into the room. The slight click with which the door
fastened caused the girl to glance up quickly.</p>

<p>"Bobby."</p>

<p>"Myrtle!"</p>

<p>In a moment he was by her side, drawing her to her feet, into
the circle of his arm. He looked down into her fair, fresh face,
upturned to his quizzically, questioningly. Something he saw in
her eyes decided him&mdash;solved questions and doubts that had
instantly sprung into his mind. Their eyes met and held as his
lips came down to hers and her arms crept to the back of his
neck.</p>

<p>"Myrtle!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bobby, I've been so worried about you!"</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;" He shrugged, holding her tighter to him. "I've
searched everywhere for you, Myrtle. Bondi. Treview, the
city&mdash;to find you here, at breakfast in your own home."</p>

<p>The girl laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Here on sufferance, Bobby. Here, hiding from my enemies."</p>

<p>"Your enemies, dear?" He frowned, then laughed. "Course, I
know there's quite a fight going on around you&mdash;for the
control of your fortune, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you don't know?"</p>

<p>"Know?" The young man's face became grave. "I know there's a
darned lot of scoundrels gathered around the Haffervale
estate&mdash;damned vultures, and among them a cowardly murderer,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you think, Bobby, when I failed to meet you by the
sundial?"</p>

<p>"I thought someone, Carriday perhaps, had abducted you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You guessed right, Bobby. I was waiting for you
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The skunk! I'll&mdash;but, old girl, what really happened.
Since you passed me that message in the hall I've not had a line
on you."</p>

<p>"Until you saw me in the glade, Bobby. Oh, dear, I was so
frightened when Keston told me that you were not there when I
sent him to bring you here."</p>

<p>"Keston went to the glade for me?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Bobby dear." The girl looked at him with a little
smile. "You are so heavy!&mdash;I couldn't move you. I thought
you were seriously hurt and tried to think what was best to do. I
couldn't go to Treview, for that man was there&mdash;the
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ibbotson, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was him who struck you with the walking-stick."</p>

<p>"You know that?"</p>

<p>"I saw him." She shuddered slightly. "I thought he had killed
you. I saw the three&mdash;Mackenzie, Carriday and
Ibbotson&mdash;carry you from the house to the glade and throw
you down. Then they held a consultation and after some discussion
walked back to the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ibbotson looked back and&mdash;and I thought he was going
to return. I waited until I was certain they were well out of
sight and then I went to you. I couldn't move you&mdash;all I
could do was to come here and ask Keston to take some help to the
glade and bring you to Madlands."</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"When Keston told me you were not in the glade, I thought they
had found you again and that that man would kill you. Keston
would not let me go with him last night. He made me go to bed. It
was only just now I that he told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He told you that I had disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Bobby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were you doing there, Myrtle?" The young man looked at
the girl, questioningly.</p>

<p>"With Gerald in the glade?" She laughed slightly. "Oh, yes, I
know! you saw me, for I saw you hiding in the bush. Oh, Bobby
dear, there's such a long story to tell."</p>

<p>"I wonder how much of the mysteries of Madlands your story
will clear up?" Bobby laughed. "And&mdash;I'm so hungry!
Wandering through the caves at Madlands."</p>

<p>"Hungry? And I'm sitting here finishing breakfast!" The girl
sprang to her feet and touched the bell. "Bobby, you don't mind
Keston knowing you're here, do you?"</p>

<p>"Mind Keston?" The newspaperman laughed. "Why, the old boy and
I are the best of pals. He's been looking for me to rescue you
from the abductors. Getting me in odd corners to ask what
progress I'm making, and all that."</p>

<p>"While all the time he's been hiding me here." Myrtle
laughed.</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"In my room and in the caves."</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"Dusk of the day when&mdash;when my&mdash;Sir Rupert
was&mdash;killed."</p>

<p>"Kamrad!" Bobby threw up his hands in mock despair. "Sure
there's a story, but I can't guess it. Look here, Myrtle. I'll
open out first&mdash;tell you all I know, then&mdash;Hallo,
Keston! Just dropped in for early breakfast and Miss Haffervale
tells me I can have it with her. Early, I know&mdash;well,
anything you can scrape up, hot or cold, will do. The caves under
this house are the best aperitif I've come across."</p>

<p>"The caves?" The girl and man showed their surprise. "How did
you know of the caves, Bobby?" Myrtle continued.</p>

<p>"Just come up from them." Then laughing at their air of
incredulity he went to the wainscoting and after a short search
found the spring working the secret door. He let the door slide
shut again and returned to his seat.</p>

<p>"Bobby, I've been hiding down there." Myrtle gasped. "I
thought I was quite safe&mdash;that no one but Keston and I knew
of them now."</p>

<p>"Mind me sharing the secret, old dear?" Without waiting for an
answer the young man swung on the butler. "Say, Keston, if you
don't want to have to dispose of my corpse, feed me. Then I'll
tell the story of my explorations and how I fought the swing
ladder in the cave below, to a gory finish. No, I won't commence
until you return. Myrt&mdash;Miss Haffervale&mdash;No, damn, it's
going to be Myrtle from now on, isn't that right, dear?"</p>

<p>The girl's bright smile and starry eyes answered him. For some
minutes they stood hand in hand looking into each other's
eyes.</p>

<p>"There's going to be a devil of a row about this, old dear."
Bobby said at length, with a low gasp of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Who?" Myrtle laughed. "Guardian Ibbotson."</p>

<p>"Will he prefer to face a charge, and conviction for attempted
murder?"</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw him assault you." Myrtle's tones were very grave. "I
heard him say he intended to kill you."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"You saw me in the glade with Gerald, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Bobby frowned.</p>

<p>"I saw you. When I left Gerald I turned at the edge of the
bush and saw you coming into the glade. I waited and saw you go
down to Treview. I watched you go round the house and go to get
in at that window. I saw him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ibbotson. He came behind you and struck you on the head.
Then Mr. Mackenzie came out with Lord Carriday and Mr. Ibbotson
said they would have to kill you or you would find out
everything."</p>

<p>"So that's that." Bobby whistled. "And you propose to hang
that over friend Ibbotson's head. But, Myrtle, think! Marrying a
journalist, even the star reporter of the <i>Mirror</i>, is
rather, well&mdash;you know, for the richest girl in
Australia."</p>

<p>"The richest girl in Australia!" Myrtle laughed softly. "And
you don't think the richest girl in Australia has a right
to&mdash;become richer?"</p>

<p>With a little happy laugh she broke from him, returning to her
seat as Keston entered, carrying a laden tray. When Bobby was
served, Myrtle motioned the butler to a seat.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Keston. Sit down, please." She said, as the man
hesitated. "I'm going to tell Mr.&mdash;" she paused. "Keston,
first I must tell you that I am going to marry Mr. Trayne."</p>

<p>"Miss Myrtle&mdash;" The man gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Just how I felt when I first realised the good news, Keston,"
Bobby nodded, "I can't quite get the hang of it, yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Miss Myrtle, Mr. Trayne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Taken as read." Bobby grinned. "Say, Myrtle, while I'm
repairing damages you might let me know where you've been since I
went to the sundial to find you."</p>

<p>"You went there?"</p>

<p>"Sure. To find only your shoe." Bobby hesitated. "Why did you
ask me to meet you there?"</p>

<p>"You remember the notice in the <i>Mirror</i>&mdash;about my
engagement to Lord Carriday. I was furious with Uncle over that.
I insisted that he contradicted it, for he had it inserted. He
promised that he would. Then&mdash;then that dreadful thing
happened and I knew that if I did not take some other means that
statement would go uncontradicted and&mdash;and so I asked you to
meet me so that I could ask you to get the contradiction in the
newspaper."</p>

<p>"I see." Bobby pondered, "But, old girl, I was there to
time&mdash;and all of you that remained there was your shoe."</p>

<p>"I know." Myrtle frowned. "I think I went to the sundial too
early. I was trying to keep out of his way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord Carriday, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the house he whispered that he wanted to speak to
me&mdash;and I didn't want to speak to him. I hated him. I went
into the grounds and wandered about, waiting for you. Then he
came up to the sundial&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>"And made a damned nuisance of himself, I suppose."</p>

<p>"He wanted me to consent to marry him. When I said I would not
he&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>

<p>For long minutes there was silence. Bobby had ceased to eat He
was staring down at the table. Myrtle had covered her face with
her hands, sobbing quietly. The butler rose to his feet and came
round the table to Bobby's side.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir, I can tell the story better than Miss Myrtle,"
he said, with some hesitation. "I've gathered a lot, looking
after her in her rooms these last couple of days."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Bobby looked up, bleakly.</p>

<p>"Lord Carriday is a passionate man, sir." Keston spoke slowly.
"I gather he found Miss Myrtle at the sundial and suggested that
she carry out the arrangement made between him and Sir Rupert.
Miss Myrtle refused and his lordship got nasty. Then Miss Myrtle
hit him and he picked her up and carried her down to the old
gardener's cottage&mdash;if you know where I mean, sir."</p>

<p>"I know the damned place." Bobby spoke tersely.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." Keston continued, smoothly. "He told Miss
Myrtle that he didn't want to be missed from the house at that
time, but that he would return to her. He said that she could
stay at the cottage until he was ready to deal with her&mdash;and
that until he returned she could think things over. Then he tied
her hands and feet and put her on the bed and left her."</p>

<p>"Left her bound?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He said he would be back by nightfall. Then, if she
was reasonable he would take her to the city and that they could
he married the next day&mdash;that was yesterday. If she didn't
feel reasonable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Lord Carriday told Miss Myrtle that there were few people who
knew that the cottage was habitable and that none of them would
come near it. His lordship told Miss Myrtle that, if she wasn't
reasonable she&mdash;she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, speak, man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He said they could stay there until she decided to
carry out her guardian's wishes, sir."</p>

<p>"Stay there with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir.'"</p>

<p>The knife between Bobby's fingers snapped, abruptly. For a
minute he looked at the pieces, dazed, then dropped them on the
ground. He rose to his feet and went to where Myrtle sat,
sobbing. She laid her face on his breast as he dropped on one
knee beside her chair. Smoothing her hair caressingly, the
newspaperman turned to the butler..</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Miss Myrtle managed to get her bonds untied and escape from
the cottage; She came to me, sir, and I hid her in her own rooms
and in the caves."</p>

<p>For some moments Bobby thought rapidly.</p>

<p>"Myrtle," he said softly, "Which way did you and Carriday
enter the cottage?"</p>

<p>"Through the back door, Bobby. Why?"</p>

<p>"You had only one shoe on."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That settles the heel-mark on the envelope clue. Then, when
you escaped, you found you couldn't walk on one high-heel, you
kicked off the other shoe and left it in the cottage. That
settles the other puzzle: Say, old dear, did you see anything of
Alice Mackenzie at the sundial or at the cottage?"</p>

<p>"No, Bobby."</p>

<p>"Thought not. There Williams and I made another of our
blunders." For some seconds he was silent. "Will yo tell me what
you and Gerald were talking about in the glade, last night,
Myrtle?"</p>

<p>"Gerald wanted me to marry him. He said that if I would, he
would undertake that neither Lord Carriday nor Mr. Ibbotson
bothered me any more."</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"No. He said that if I married him he would clear up the
mystery surrounding the shooting of my uncle."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>"Now I wonder how Mr. Gerald came in a position to promise
that?"</p>

<p>A deep, grave voice spoke from the doorway.</p>

<p>Bobby looked up. Framed in the open doorway was Inspector
Williams, surveying the little group at the head of the table
with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, Miss Haffervale." The Inspector same forward
holding out his hand. "I trust you are not going to disappear
again?"</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that," Bobby spoke emphatically.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">THE Inspector laughed. He sauntered around to
the other side of the table and seated himself. A little grim
smile of triumph came on his lips as he looked across at the
newspaperman who, apparently, had no thought but for the girl at
his side.</p>

<p>"Had breakfast, Bobby?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry!" Myrtle touched the bell. "You're rather
late&mdash;I mean early, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Early or late?" Williams laughed.</p>

<p>"I've an idea a certain lady connected with Madlands has been
very early for more than one morning of late, Miss
Haffervale."</p>

<p>"And dreadfully hungry for lunch." The girl made a small moue.
"Breakfast at seven, or before, and lunch in one's room at one or
after, excites the appetite. Keston believes I have developed an
alarming craving for biscuits."</p>

<p>"There's nothing exciting in being in hiding, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Not when there's a couple of professionals and a pack of
private detectives haunting the premises?" The big man laughed
heartily. "I'm going to congratulate Keston, though. He almost
put it over me."</p>

<p>"How is the invalid?" Bobby asked hastily.</p>

<p>"Chippy." Again the grim smile flicked the detective's lips.
"Had a talk with him an hour ago, and he quite opened up. Found
it wise, perhaps; there's almost enough to land him in the Queer
Place if he refuses to talk."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Bobby had to pause for at that moment Keston
entered with the breakfast tray.</p>

<p>When they were alone Williams refused to talk, busying himself
with the breakfast. At length, he pushed back his chair from the
table and pulled out a long, wicked-looking cigar.</p>

<p>"Object to smoke, Miss Haffervale?" he asked, casually biting
off the end of the torpedo.</p>

<p>"Of that, yes!" Bobby interjected, countering Myrtle's nod of
assent.</p>

<p>"Don't let him light that, Myrtle." He went to the sideboard.
"Here you are, Williams. Sir Rupert knew a good cigar."</p>

<p>"Thanks." The Inspector returned the defamed cigar to his
waistcoat pocket and selected one from the box Bobby held out to
him. "Effeminate things, these modern young men, Miss Haffervale.
Don't value a strong bit of tobacco. Want something light and
fancy, done up in packets with portraits of dancing girls on the
outside. Think they taste better that way, maybe."</p>

<p>"I shan't mind what you smoke, Inspector," Myrtle spoke
bravely.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't test you." The Inspector lit the cigar and drew
luxuriantly on it. "Good smoke this, Bobby."</p>

<p>"Too good for the man who shirked work yesterday." The
newspaperman spoke grimly.</p>

<p>"So you did bite? I inquired at headquarters and they told me
that you had rung up; that you seemed annoyed when they said that
Inspector Williams was missing." The detective laughed. "Well,
well! Superintendent Manners could have told you a different tale
if he'd wanted to. Had quite a talk with him at mid-day. He said
you'd rang up once."</p>

<p>"I rang up three times."</p>

<p>"So he said when I spoke to him again, during the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"You held out on me," Bobby accused.</p>

<p>"Haven't you held out on me, Bobby?" The Inspector sounded
mildly sarcastic. "Ah, well, we'll have a heart to heart talk,
later. Just for the time I'll say I've got a line on
things&mdash;got it yesterday afternoon&mdash;and decided that I
was best out here, until&mdash;well, until things broke."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Want to know what Carruthers has to say?"</p>

<p>"Jove!" Bobby leaned forward interestedly. "You mean to say
he's opened out?"</p>

<p>"Quite a lot," the detective grinned. "By the way, Miss
Haffervale, you shouldn't bang doors behind you. Might hit
someone on the head&mdash;perhaps knock him out."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Bobby glanced from the girl to the man.
"Why, then, Myrtle you were the wraith we saw disappear over the
cliffs last night."</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Guessed it at the time," Williams grinned. "Y' see, I found
the way down the cliff to the cave, yesterday."</p>

<p>"And explored the caves?"</p>

<p>"No." The detective hesitated. "Thought we might try that this
morning, Bobby. But I guessed Miss Haffervale was using the caves
as a hiding place; and that she communicated with Keston from the
hut on the cliffs."</p>

<p>Bobby and the girl exchanged glances, and the young man shook
his head slightly. He was not prepared to lay his cards on the
table. He was guessing much, but he wanted real evidence before
he had a connected tale to tell.</p>

<p>"It's like this;" continued the Inspector. "Miss Haffervale
has been using the caves for a hiding place. She was on her way
there last night, when Carruthers caught sight of her. He
followed, tracking her to the hut on the cliffs. He waited
outside and heard her speak to Keston over the telephone. Then he
entered the hut and tried to capture her."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked the newspaperman hastily;</p>

<p>"Because he knew his employer, Ibbotson, would appreciate
having control of Miss Haffervale, especially as she had been
reported missing for some time."</p>

<p>"The brute!"</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't get her. Miss Haffervale managed to wriggle
out of his grasp and rushed out of the hut, slamming the door
shut behind her. The catch didn't act, and the door rebounded,
striking Carruthers across the face and felling him, as he went
to follow her. Laid him out, fair&mdash;and good enough for him,
too."</p>

<p>Bobby looked at Myrtle. The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"But what of the cloak and mask?" the journalist asked.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Haffervale?" Williams inquired.</p>

<p>"They belong to me," the girl admitted quietly. "Last night I
was in a light-coloured dress and wore the cloak over It. When I
went into the hut I hid the cloak and mask in the cabinet, ready
for the next time I came up the cliffs."</p>

<p>"I thought so," Williams nodded.</p>

<p>"Then Carruthers&mdash;" commented Bobby.</p>

<p>"Carruthers has been responsible for quite a lot that
mystified us," interrupted the detective. "I've got his statement
here. First, I'm going to tell you that there were no less than
four persons in the Madlands grounds during the meeting in the
dining room that ended in the shooting of Sir Rupert
Haffervale."</p>

<p>"<i>Four</i> people?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Carruthers&mdash;well, you know that he's Ibbotson's
shadow and general dirty-worker. Then there was a man named
Armstrong. He was working for Lord Carriday, but just what his
line was I don't quite get yet. More 'n likely he was watching
the others. The third man was Peters. Has a bit of a record with
H.Q., but seems to have turned over a new leaf of late and now
calls himself a private inquiry agent. He gets quite a lot of
work from Mr. Mackenzie. From what Carruthers tells me he was
keeping tabs on the meeting&mdash;and Alice Mackenzie.</p>

<p>"Was she there?"</p>

<p>Williams grinned. "I'll say she was! Dressed as a man, with
number 10 boots on. She made the marks on the terrace and also
the boot mark by the sundial&mdash;the one that puzzled us.</p>

<p>"But she couldn't, man." Bobby exclaimed. "Why, she came here
to see you but a short time after the&mdash;the shooting. She
wouldn't have had time to get to Treview, dress, and return."</p>

<p>"Didn't want it." The detective spoke decisively. "She changed
into her man-kit at the cottage and then came into Madlands
grounds. Then, when the shooting took place she bolted back to
the cottage and came to see me&mdash;in her normal rig-out."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may be, before we get to the end of this trial." Williams
laughed. "Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what was she after?" protested Bobby.</p>

<p>"There was a certain noble lord at Madlands and there had been
quite an interesting item in the <i>Mirror</i> that morning."
The detective explained. "Get me, Bobby?"</p>

<p>The journalist nodded. He could not pursue that line of
investigation before Myrtle!</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can explain that piece of paper? You remember.
The 'Madlands, Barrabarra Bay. 9 to 1' note."</p>

<p>"Carruthers says that was Armstrong's instructions from Lord
Carriday."</p>

<p>Again Bobby became silent. Facts were falling into place with
startling rapidity. He glanced at the girl at the head of the
table, sitting silently, intent on the detective's statement, her
chin cupped in her hands.</p>

<p>"That's all, Williams?" he said at length.</p>

<p>"Not by a mile." The detective spread a sheet of foolscap on
the table before him. "Perhaps in place of asking questions, you
will allow me to tell the man's story as he told it to me. It's
this. Listen:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"For some time Carruthers has been exclusively
employed by Ibbotson, partly for protection, partly to gather
information for his employer regarding the actions of Lord
Carriday, Sir Rupert and Mr. Mackenzie. They seem to have
constituted a 'big four' in the financial world that didn't trust
one another&mdash;not a bit. They were out to grab all they could
get as individuals and only formed the pack when their mutual
interests coincided. Carruthers got quite a lot of information
for his employer&mdash;and a darned sight more for himself. Looks
to me that if things hadn't bust up that he'd have gone into the
blackmailing industry, with some success."</p><br>

<p>Bobby nodded.</p>

<p>"While Ibbotson didn't trust any of his partners, he was more
friendly with Mackenzie than with the other two. He didn't like
Carriday nor that man's close association with Sir Rupert. He
positively hated the latter.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"For more than one reason." Williams glanced almost stealthily
at the girl. "There was&mdash;" He hesitated. "Sorry, Miss
Haffervale, if I trespass, but, well&mdash;Mr. Ibbotson thought
he'd like to control the Haffervale Trust and&mdash;and there was
only one way to do that."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ibbotson wanted to marry me." Myrtle spoke gravely. "He
spoke to me and&mdash;and he spoke to Sir Rupert, even after I
had refused to have anything to do with him. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was the reason for Carruthers following you last night."
Bobby came to his feet with an angry frown. "Of all
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Bobby." The detective spoke imperatively: yet it
was the girl's gentle hand on his arm that brought Bobby to his
seat again.</p>

<p>"That, and more." Williams troubled glances again sought the
girl. "There was something between Mr. Ibbotson and&mdash;and
Mrs. Mackenzie."</p>

<p>"Lord, man! You don't think that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Williams interjected. "All I'm going to say is
that Alice Mackenzie was a lady of very&mdash;very&mdash;with a
very firm eye to the main chance&mdash;for herself. Mr. Ibbotson
seems to have formed the opinion that Sir Rupert had interposed
in a very promising friendship."</p>

<p>"The damned brute." Bobby thrust his hands in his pockets,
slouching back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Then there was friction between Mr. Ibbotson and Sir Rupert
over the various trust interests and the details of the various
businesses of which they were co-directors." The detective's tone
was very impersonal. "Carruthers told me quite a lot about those
interests and I've gathered more from other sources. You see, Sir
Rupert was a high-handed gentleman&mdash;and the Haffervale Trust
holds a majority of shares in the companies that Ibbotson looked
upon as peculiarly his own."</p>

<p>The detective paused and again he glanced at the girl. Bobby
was silent, pondering over the revelations Williams had obtained
from the private detective.</p>

<p>"There is something else, Inspector?" Myrtle spoke gently, yet
her eyes challenged the detective.</p>

<p>"There is, Miss Haffervale." Williams shifted uneasily. "I
said just now that I proposed to have a look at the caves this
morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Carruthers interested in the caves?" The girl spoke
quickly. "I did not think he could find them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Preston knew of the caves?" inquired the detective.</p>

<p>"Did he?" Myrtle was puzzled. "I thought the caves were
somewhat of a family secret. My father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Matthew Haffervale did not use the caves?" asked the
detective quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"Nor did Sir Rupert Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"I am certain he did not."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely positive." The girl spoke with assurance. "The
only reason for keeping the caves secret was because they formed
an entrance into the house that it was difficult to guard. My
father often declared he would have them bricked, up, but at the
same time he was rather proud of them. You know, Inspector, they
were used in the first days of the colony to smuggle rum and
tobacco into the settlement. Most of the exchange in those days
took the form of rum and tobacco."</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" Bobby asked quickly, as the detective
nodded.</p>

<p>"Simply that the caves are again in use, and for the old
purpose. They've been used quite a lot of late."</p>

<p>"Who by?"</p>

<p>"'Fat' Carruthers and Gerald Preston."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">BOBBY swung round on his chair and looked at the
detective, his eyes opened wide with wonder.</p>

<p>"'Fat' Carruthers and Gerald Preston?" he gasped. "They've
used the caves below Madlands? What the devil for?"</p>

<p>"I've told you. Smuggling."</p>

<p>For a long space there was silence; then Bobby laughed.</p>

<p>"Say, old man," he asked with mock concern. "There's nothing
troubling you? Not suffering from toothache&mdash;or any pains in
the head? No dizziness nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor am I offering to solve the mysteries surrounding Madlands
within twenty-four hours if Miss Haffervale marries me
tomorrow!" He laughed at the concern showing on the young
people's faces, "Didn't think I knew that, did you? No, Mr.
Gerald Preston's not so simple as be tries to make out. He knows
more than a little of what we're after and&mdash;But that doesn't
affect his business with friend Carruthers. That's of long
standing."</p>

<p>"And is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As I said before, a matter of smuggling. Reversion to type,
if you like to call it that."</p>

<p>"Smuggling?"</p>

<p>"You know that Preston is hard up?"</p>

<p>"Never knew him otherwise. Spends all he earns and would, if
he had the salary list of all Australia. He'd be in debt if he
owned the Commonwealth Bank. He's the sort of fellow who could go
to market with a thousand pounds in his pockets and not bring
home the value of a penny postage stamp."</p>

<p>"Hot, Bobby?" The detective laughed. "Yes, hot, but not far
wrong. As you say, Gerald Preston has always wanted money and
when he butted up against 'Fat' Carruthers he learned how to make
quite a lot."</p>

<p>"Then that's what he was so anxious to get in town for on the
day of&mdash;of the shooting!" Bobby exclaimed as light suddenly
dawned on him. "I see the game now. Parcel of stuff in the house
and murder committed. Police on the premises and the weapon
missing. Of course there'd be a search. Lord! how the poor devil
most have sweated! Say, where is he?"</p>

<p>"Wooing the sleep of the unjust!" Williams laughed. "At all
events, he's not up yet. But, not a word of this for the present.
Smuggling's a small matter compared with murder. When we have the
gun and the man, well, then we'll turn on Mr. Gerald. Until
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bobby nodded.</p>

<p>"So that explains the telephone lines." The newspaperman spoke
meditatively, his brain jumping off at a tangent.</p>

<p>"Not exactly." The detective became grave and ill at ease
again; his eyes wandering towards the girl, grave and attentive
at the head of the table. "Gerald fitted those lines up, except
the line from the house to the hut&mdash;but not entirely for
smuggling."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's a line from the hut to the cottage; another to the
caves; another from the cottage to the summer-house at Treview.
That's what Carruthers tells me&mdash;but he only knows of them
from what his smuggling partner has told him."</p>

<p>"And he did not misinform him."</p>

<p>Bobby grinned. "Don Juan Rupert, eh?"</p>

<p>"Just so." A quick glance from the detective's keen eyes shut
down further inquiry.</p>

<p>"Then when Mr. Gerald comes to breakfast&mdash;" commenced
Bobby.</p>

<p>"If you please, Miss." Keston spoke from the door. "Mr.
Parsons is in the library and would like to speak to Inspector
Williams."</p>

<p>"Master Gerald will have to have his breakfast alone." The
detective rose with a sign of relief. "I was wondering how we
were going to pass matters with the gentleman, for the time.
Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm coming with you, Inspector," Bobby announced, sharply.
Then noticing the detective's indecision, he added, "I think I
have some information that may interest our good lawyer
friend."</p>

<p>"May I join the party, Inspector?" Myrtle rose from her seat.
"I think it is time I met my official guardian again
and&mdash;and I believe I have some news for him."</p>

<p>"I'll guess your news in one," Williams laughed. "I'm
wondering what Guardian Ibbotson will say to your news?"</p>

<p>"I may have to leave you to convince that gentleman." Myrtle
spoke demurely. "I happened to be at Treview last night and
witnessed his cowardly assault on my future husband. Later I
overheard him urging on Mr. Mackenzie the expediency of putting
him out of the way."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" The detective stared at the girl with wide-open
eyes. "You were there? Then, if Bobby lays a
complaint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall certainly give evidence&mdash;unless, of course, Mr.
Ibbotson offers recompense."</p>

<p>"Valuable&mdash;exceedingly valuable recompense!" added
Bobby.</p>

<p>Williams turned to the door, his shoulders shaking. As he
stood on one side for the girl to pass he asked:</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Ibbotson remain at Treview last night, Miss
Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. You will find Lord Carriday also a guest at Mr.
Mackenzie's house."</p>

<p>"I think I shall send them an invitation to visit Madlands
this morning." Williams grinned slightly as he followed Myrtle
and Bobby into the great hall. He beckoned to a man lounging by
the entrance doors and whispered a few words. When he rejoined
the couple by the library door his smile had considerably
broadened.</p>

<p>"Shall I call this a wedding-present, Bobby?" he
whispered.</p>

<p>"It'll be a better one than the plated fish-knives you usually
give, Inspector."</p>

<p>They found Mark Parsons seated at the big desk in the centre
of the room. He rose to his feet quickly at the sight of the
girl.</p>

<p>"Myrtle. I had understood you had disappeared."</p>

<p>"Abducted, Mr. Parsons." The girl's tones were maliciously
sweet. "In that case I should have thought my guardian would have
come in search of me."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons understood that you were quite safe while I was
looking after you, Myrtle?" Bobby grinned at sight of the
solicitor's face.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Trayne." The lawyer
stiffened. "Miss Haffervale's safely can be no concern of
yours."</p>

<p>"In spite of the fact that she has promised to marry me?"</p>

<p>"Absurd! Such a marriage cannot take place." Parsons flushed
red.</p>

<p>"And I relied on Mr. Parsons to give away the bride," Bobby
turned to Williams in mock dismay. "Perhaps, if I offer him some
information I possess regarding the Bralley mortgages&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you know?"</p>

<p>"I think we will drop that, Bobby." Williams spoke coolly.
"There's a lot to be explained before we arrive at marriages and
giving in marriage."</p>

<p>He turned to the lawyer. "Mr. Parsons, I understand that Mr.
Trayne can indicate the whereabouts of the Bralley mortgages,
when necessary. I have asked him, however, to keep his knowledge
to himself until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The documents belong to the Haffervale Estate." Parsons spoke
quickly. "They should be placed in my hands as trustee for the
estate. If Mr. Trayne refuses to give them up I shall apply to
the courts for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If any action is taken regarding those papers without my
sanction," interposed the detective sternly, "I shall ask Mr.
Trayne to deposit the mortgages at police headquarters, pending
the conclusion of the inquiries I am making. If so, they will
remain in the possession of the police until the Commissioner
thinks fit to release them."</p>

<p>"I don't think you understand, Inspector." The solicitor tried
to show a bold front. "Those mortgages are extremely
valuable."</p>

<p>"They will be safe in the hands of the police."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly protest at your action, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons." Williams' voice became very stern. "At the
moment I am engaged in investigating the murder of Sir Rupert
Haffervale. I believe that before I have finished that
investigation I shall be involved in an investigation of certain
irregularities concerning the Haffervale Trust. This morning, Mr.
Trayne is laying a charge of attempted murder against your
co-trustee, Adam Ibbotson. I think you will find it to your best
interests not to further&mdash;er&mdash;complicate matters."</p>

<p>For many minutes there was silence in the room. At length the
solicitor turned to the detective.</p>

<p>"You are making very grave statements, Inspector Williams. In
my position I am also an officer of the law. It is my duty to
give you all the help I can. If you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of your assistance, Mr. Parsons." The
detective's voice did not relax. "I believe you possess certain
information that will be extremely valuable to me. Will you
answer my questions freely and frankly?"</p>

<p>Again came silence. Parsons walked to the big windows and
stood for some time looking out over the waters of the bay. At
length became to a decision and faced the detective.</p>

<p>"Inspector Williams, you have a very big reputation in your
department. I shall back your superiors' opinion of you and
answer your questions to the best of my ability."</p>

<p>Williams' official attitude relaxed. He motioned to the seats
around the desk. "If you don't mind, Mr. Parsons, we will
commence at the beginning of things."</p>

<p>For some minutes he sat pondering deeply; then spoke
suddenly.</p>

<p>"You were with Sir Rupert the evening before his death?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert discussed with you the meeting appointed for the
next day; the day on which Miss Haffervale came of age?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He told you that he had obtained the presence of Mr. Trayne
at that meeting?"</p>

<p>The lawyer nodded.</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert Haffervale had discovered his associates in the
Haffervale Trust had recently conspired on a bear market to
depreciate the trust's securities&mdash;to their personal
benefit."</p>

<p>"And those associates were?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ibbotson, Mr. Mackenzie, and Lord Carriday."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert believed that he had obtained conclusive evidence
of intent to defraud?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert's evidence seemed to me complete. I approved of
his proposed actions."</p>

<p>"When Mr. Trayne arrived at Madlands on the morning of the
meeting, Sir Rupert supplied him with an automatic pistol,
requiring him to carry it to the meeting. Can you inform me for
what purpose?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert had reason to believe that more than one of his
associates in the Haffervale Trust were always armed. He feared
Mr. Ibbotson's known irritable temper."</p>

<p>"Had Sir Rupert any particular reason for timing a certain
stage of the proceedings of the meeting for exactly the hour of
noon?"</p>

<p>"Only that Miss Haffervale was born exactly at noon."</p>

<p>"I have been informed that Sir Rupert telephoned the local
police station requesting that a constable be sent to Madlands,
to arrive exactly at noon. Was that action taken in view of fear
of personal violence from his business associates?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Sir Rupert had recently discovered that his
secretary, Gerald Preston, had embezzled a large sum of money
from the Estate."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" Bobby sprang to his feet. "Gerald embezzled
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" The Inspector's harsh voice cut off the end
of Bobby's; exclamation. "Will you please sit down, Mr.
Trayne?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." Bobby subsided into his seat, his face
flushed.</p>

<p>"At the commencement of the meeting," continued the Inspector,
"Sir Rupert placed his watch, open, on the table before him.
Later I found that the watch had not been wound for some
considerable time; that it was gradually running slower and
slower. Has that statement any effect on you, Mr. Parsons?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. Sir Rupert was with me to a very late hour at
his club in the city. He slept there that night. It is possible
he forgot to wind his watch on retiring for the night."</p>

<p>"Very possible," The detective mused. "Yet he planned to
install his niece at the head of the table at the noon hour, I
believe."</p>

<p>"You are quite correct." The lawyer spoke more easily. "Sir
Rupert had the idea that his niece should be seated at the head
of the table at the time he exposed the underhand dealings of his
financial associates. He was going to call on them to resign from
all offices of trust in the estate and in the companies
controlled by the estate. In fact, I brought with me, to
Madlands, documents I had prepared to give effect to such
actions."</p>

<p>"Yet Sir Rupert had caused to be published in that morning's
<i>Mirror</i> a statement to the effect that a marriage had been
arranged between his niece and Lord Carriday&mdash;one of the men
you inform me he was preparing to denounce as unworthy to hold
office in the Haffervale Trust."</p>

<p>"I believe Sir Rupert gave that statement to the social
editress of the <i>Mirror</i> some days previously!" Parsons
spoke with some hesitation. "I believe he wrote out the statement
before he obtained the evidence convicting Lord Carriday of
conspiring with the other two to men to rob the trust. I think he
forgot the matter in the stress of the moment and did not recall
what he had done until Miss Haffervale protested at the
announcement. He then immediately, and in my presence, agreed to
have inserted in the newspaper a denial of the engagement."</p>

<p>The detective nodded. He waited some moments before proceeding
with his next question.</p>

<p>"You told me previously that you heard only part of Miss
Haffervale's protest at the announcement of her engagement to
Lord Carriday. You have not since remembered her concluding
words?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can supply them, Inspector." Myrtle spoke quietly.
"I told my uncle that I considered Lord Carriday a thoroughly
evil man. That any woman connected with him would be
irretrievably ruined."</p>

<p>"You had reason for so strong a statement, Miss Haffervale?"
The Inspector turned to the girl, sharply.</p>

<p>"I had very good reasons, Inspector." Myrtle spoke proudly.
"That morning, Mrs. Mackenzie had telephoned me from Treview,
asking if the reported announcement of the engagement in the
<i>Mirror</i> was true. Before I could reply she went on to state
that Lord Carriday was her lover and loved her alone
and&mdash;and that she loved him."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">BOBBY caught at the girl's hand, in sympathy.
Myrtle smiled bravely, yet the rich colour flooded her face. For
a moment the Inspector's official poise dropped and he turned to
the girl, something like moisture in his eyes; then, with a
slight cough, he turned again to the solicitor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons, I am informed that Sir Rupert gave instructions
that while the meeting was taking place in the Madlands
dining-room no one was to be admitted to, or work in the
grounds."</p>

<p>"That is correct."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert had no knowledge that each of his business
associates had brought with them to that meeting his private
detective, who had orders to penetrate the Madlands grounds and
try and oversee and overhear what transpired in the
dining-room."</p>

<p>"I am certain that Sir Rupert had no such knowledge."</p>

<p>"I believe that Mr. Ibbotson called at Madlands during the
morning of the day preceding the meeting?"</p>

<p>"That is correct. I was with Sir Rupert in the library when
Mr. Ibbotson was announced."</p>

<p>"The interview took place in your presence?"</p>

<p>"No. I remained in the library. Sir Rupert and Mr. Ibbotson
went into the dining-room."</p>

<p>"Did Sir Rupert inform you after Mr. Ibbotson left of the
nature of that interview?"</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert returned to the library when Mr. Ibbotson left the
house. Sir Rupert was much annoyed. He told me that Mr. Ibbotson
had demanded that Miss Haffervale accept him as her
husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Demanded?"</p>

<p>"That is how Sir Rupert phrased it.</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert declined the proposed honour on behalf of his
niece?"</p>

<p>"Most emphatically."</p>

<p>"I believe there were hot words exchanged between the two
men?"</p>

<p>"I was informed so. I did not overhear any. Sir Rupert
complained of Mr. Ibbotson's habit of flourishing his stick."</p>

<p>"Flourishing his stick? Did he do any damage?"</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed. "I believe he knocked one of the prisms
off the chandelier in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"He knocked down a prism from the chandelier in the
dining-room?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sir Rupert came into the library carrying the prism. The
glass was not broken, only the thin wire that hooked it into
place. Sir Rupert found a piece of wire and formed a new hook. He
then called Keston and they went to the library. I went with
them. Keston mounted on a chair on the table and Sir Rupert
handed the prism up to him, then Keston fitted it into
place."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Bobby leaned forward, interestedly. "Mr. Parsons,
did you notice how Keston handled that prism?"</p>

<p>The solicitor looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I remember now," he said after a moment's pause. "Sir Rupert
polished the prism on his handkerchief and Keston, when he took
it from Sir Rupert, held it by the wire hook. I don't think he
touched the prism."</p>

<p>Bobby looked at the detective, a comical grimace on his face.
Williams laughed gently. One of the main puzzles of the mystery
surrounding the death of the baronet had proved absurdly futile.
Again the detective turned to the solicitor, but Bobby
interposed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons, when I called on you yesterday I asked if you
knew where Myrtle was. You replied that she was well and happy.
Had you any reasons for that statement?"</p>

<p>"Only that I considered your inquiry an impertinence." The
solicitor spoke bitterly. "I cannot acknowledge that you can have
any interest in Miss Haffervale."</p>

<p>"Thank you." The colour mounted to Bobby's face but he held
his temper in check. "Another matter, Mr. Parsons. I happened to
notice in your managing clerk's room&mdash;Mr. Frank Frazer's
room&mdash;a photo of a young girl on his desk."</p>

<p>Parsons nodded as Bobby paused.</p>

<p>"When I spoke of Sir Rupert to Mr. Frazer he answered very
bitterly. Is there any reason to connect Mr. Frazer's
evident&mdash;dislike&mdash;of Sir Rupert with&mdash;with that
photo?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must say 'yes.'" The solicitor spoke with great
reluctance. "The photograph is of Mr. Frazer's daughter. She was
a clerk in the <i>Mirror</i>'s offices. Later, she was promoted to the position of secretary to Sir Rupert. I believe she
was&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert, you mean?"</p>

<p>Parsons did not answer.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that there is an air of antagonism against Mr.
Trayne amongst the members of the Haffervale Trust, Mr. Parsons."
Williams spoke quietly. "I fear I notice a bias that way in your
manner, Mr. Parsons. Is that manner the outcome of any definite
reason?"</p>

<p>"I believe Mr. Trayne shot Sir Rupert." The answer came in
cold, passionless tones.</p>

<p>"By&mdash;" Bobby sprang to his feet, his face aflame with
passion. Myrtle's quiet hand stayed him and he sank back on the
chair beside her.</p>

<p>"I will answer for Mr. Trayne." The girl spoke proudly. "Mr.
Parsons, for the time you are the only trustee of the Haffervale
Trust I recognise. Mr. Ibbotson has betrayed his position, and I
believe the courts will remove him from office, if what you have
told us this morning is correct. Therefore I now formally inform
you that I propose to marry Mr. Trayne as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I shall refuse my consent."</p>

<p>For some moments the girl sat, pondering thoughtfully. She
rose from her seat and went to the panelling in a corner of the
room. Touching one of the bosses a small door flew open,
revealing the door of a safe. Unlocking the safe. Myrtle took out
a packet of papers and returned to her seat.</p>

<p>"You did not examine that safe, Mr. Parsons?" The girl asked
in quiet tones.</p>

<p>"I did not know of its existence."</p>

<p>"That is my private safe. Sir Rupert had it installed for me."
She paused, then continued: "Mr. Parsons, I have here the Bralley
mortgages. With them is a formal transfer of the mortgages from
Sir Rupert to myself."</p>

<p>"That is impossible." The solicitor spoke quickly. "The
mortgages were taken by the trust."</p>

<p>"Another document is a purchase of the mortgages from the
trust by Sir Rupert Haffervale. It antedates my transfer by one
day. Sir Rupert gave me the mortgages as a birthday present. I am
the legal holder of the Bralley mortgages."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not satisfied with the security, Mr. Parsons." Myrtle
spoke coldly</p>

<p>"You infer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When Sir Rupert gave me the mortgages he informed me that he
considered the security considerably overvalued. That was the
reason he purchased them from the trust, for he considered that
he was responsible for the mistake. He placed the mortgages, with
transfer, in this envelope. Also he enclosed a letter setting out
his reasons for taking the mortgage for the trust, in the first
instance."</p>

<p>"And those reasons?" Parsons laughed slightly sarcastic.</p>

<p>"I do not yet know. Sir Rupert asked me not to open the
envelope until after his death. I shall do so now."</p>

<p>The three men sat and watched the girl while she slit the
envelope and drew out the papers. Examining the mortgages she
handed them and the transfer to Bobby, then slowly read the
letter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parsons." Raising her eyes the girl looked direct at the
lawyer. "I have read Sir Rupert's letter. In it he states that
having found certain members of the Haffervale Trust were looting
the trust funds he thought it wise to obtain some hold over every
member associated in the estate. This mortgage Sir Rupert
considered was his hold over you, Mr. Parsons."</p>

<p>"Are you stating that Sir Rupert accused me of
irregular&mdash;unprofessional conduct, Miss Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"You will remember that Sir Rupert insisted that a clause be
inserted in the deeds that if the value of the shares in the
Bralley Trust fell below a certain figure that mortgagor had a
right to foreclose."</p>

<p>"If you foreclose that mortgage you will smash the Bralley
Estates, Miss Haffervale." Beads of perspiration stood on the
solicitor's brow.</p>

<p>"Will the bankruptcy of the Bralley Estates affect you,
personally, Mr. Parsons?"</p>

<p>"I shall be ruined."</p>

<p>The eyes of the man and girl met and clashed. Then followed a
long, painful silence, broken by a sharp rap at the door. With a
sign of relief Williams sprang to the door and wrenched it open.
He spoke a word to a man in the hall, then turned to the
girl.</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale, with your permission I would like an
adjournment to the dining-room. Mr. Ibbotson, Mr. Mackenzie and
Lord Carriday are here, and Mr. Preston is somewhere about the
house. I want, if possible, to have a small
reconstruction&mdash;nothing to worry you, Miss
Haffervale&mdash;of the scene in the dining-room before the
firing of the&mdash;er&mdash;shot."</p>

<p>Myrtle nodded and led from the library. In the great hall were
gathered the financiers, uneasy and whispering tensely. Almost
at the library door stood Gerald Preston. As Myrtle came out of
the room he moved to her side but she passed him without sign of
recognition, beckoning Bobby to keep his place by her side. At
the dining-room door she waited until Inspector Williams came up
to her, then followed him into the room.</p>

<p>"Will you take your places around the table&mdash;the places
you occupied when the regrettable shooting of&mdash;occurred?"
Williams spoke briskly. "I want you in exactly the same positions
as when Sir Rupert opened the proceedings."</p>

<p>"What's this for?" Ibbotson stood in the doorway, leaning on
his heavy stick, morose and sullen. "I've not come here to play
games."</p>

<p>"I am asking you to take your part in a serious work, Mr.
Ibbotson." The Inspector spoke quietly. Then, as the big man did
not move. "I believe you had some trouble at Treview last night,
Mr. Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>"Trouble?" Ibbotson's bloodshot eyes travelled quickly to
Bobby's bandaged head. "Trouble! Poof! I had to knock a silly
young calf over the head last night, if that's what you
mean."</p>

<p>"I am glad you acknowledge it." The detective's tones were
icy. "I may have something to say on the matter later."</p>

<p>"Say?" The big man scoffed loudly. "That calf won't bleat,
I'll swear."</p>

<p>"There was a witness&mdash;a witness to a very definite
suggestion&mdash;to murder."</p>

<p>For the moment the big man was staggered. Then with a laugh he
moved into the room, to the chair where he had sat at the
meeting.</p>

<p>"Trying to frighten me? There was no witness, I'll swear. And
if there were, who's to say that a newspaper spy, prying into
other people's windows, shouldn't get a broken head?"</p>

<p>The Inspector did not answer. He watched until the men were
seated, then went to the head of the table and took the chair
where Sir Rupert had sat.</p>

<p>"Miss Haffervale and gentlemen." The detective spoke gravely.
"I am not trying to harrow your feelings. I have no intention of
going into any mimicry of the sad and
fatal&mdash;accident&mdash;that happened in this room but a few
short hours ago. There are few movements, however, I want
checked. You will remember that I was not here until some time
after the&mdash;Sir Rupert's death. I want to know your positions
before&mdash;that." He paused a moment. "I take it that you are
now in the positions you held when Sir Rupert opened the
proceedings?"</p>

<p>A little murmur of assent ran round the table.</p>

<p>"Did anyone move&mdash;leave the table?" asked the detective,
after a slight pause.</p>

<p>"I did." Gerald rose to his feet. "I went to the table where
Bobby Trayne is sitting and spoke to him. I sat with him for some
minutes."</p>

<p>"Then do so, now, please."</p>

<p>Gerald sauntered down the room and sat down at the small table
opposite Bobby.</p>

<p>"Is that correct, Mr. Trayne?" Williams asked.</p>

<p>"Approximately so." Bobby agreed. "What is the
difference?"</p>

<p>"When Gerald came down to this table he brought with him Mr.
Ibbotson's stick. He kicked against it when he rose from his
chair and it fell to the ground."</p>

<p>"That's right." The tobacco-magnate grunted. "When I went out
of the room I missed my stick. Later I came back and found it
under that little table. I wondered how it had got there."</p>

<p>Almost reluctantly Gerald returned to his first seat. He
picked up the massive stick and returned to the small table.</p>

<p>"Any further movements, please?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>"Has anyone any suggestions to make towards a solution of the
mystery surrounding the fatal shooting?" Williams asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Again his question was received in silence.</p>

<p>"Two of the men present in this room, were armed at the time
of Sir Rupert's death. They were Mr. Ibbotson and Mr. Trayne. Mr.
Ibbotson's revolver was fully loaded and had not been fired that
day, or since it was last cleaned. Mr. Trayne had on the table
with him an automatic gun, handed to him by Sir Rupert a few
minutes before the meeting. Mr. Trayne, however, removed the
magazine from the pistol. The pistol had not been fired and the
magazine was full."</p>

<p>Again silence followed the end of the detective's speech. An
uneasy silence, for more than one man in the room was certain
that the Inspector was on the track of some vital
information.</p>

<p>"Then, we assume that Mr. Ibbotson's revolver and Mr. Trayne's
automatic were the only two weapons in the room," continued the
detective. "Thus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is not true!" Gerald was on his feet, his face livid
with passion "Bobby Trayne had one gun on the table, but he
carried another. Here it is."</p>

<p>With a dramatic gesture the secretary flung the automatic
Bobby had given him on to the table. With a queer grating sound
it slipped up the polished surface to come to a rest almost under
the hands of the detective.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">FOR long minutes there was silence in the room.
Bobby had sprung to his feet, standing beside Gerald at the foot
of the table. There was a little smile on his lips, a twinkle in
his eyes, that belied the pallor that had spread over his
face.</p>

<p>He glanced at the two rows of faces bounding the long table.
Next to where he stood sat Carriday, looking up with open malice
in his little green eyes hidden under their almost colourless
lashes. Next to him sat Ibbotson beaming triumph and snorting and
grunting almost indistinguishable words.</p>

<p>His eyes came to rest on Myrtle. The girl was sitting back
staring down the table at him. A strange little smile hovered
about her lips. As her eyes met his she nodded slightly, as if to
reassure him. He straightened big shoulders, flashing defiance on
the men he well knew were antagonistic to him.</p>

<p>Almost against his will his eyes travelled past the
detective, and fell on Parsons. To his surprise he saw in the
thin, austere face something he could only interpret as sympathy.
Yet, up to that moment the man had shown uncontrollable hostility
to him. What did that shrewd, kindly expression mean? But a bare
hour ago the man had definitely accused him of shooting Sir
Rupert.</p>

<p>He drew his eyes from Parsons and looked at Williams, seated
at the head of the table. The detective's face was immobile. In
his eyes was an expression that could only be read as
expectation&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>What was the Inspector waiting for? Why didn't he speak? Bobby
shrugged his shoulders, impatiently. There was going to be an
awkward scene. He was going to be asked to account for the
possession of the automatic. It was his own property. He would
have to acknowledge that. He would have to admit that he had not
brought it to light when Williams first searched the room and its
occupants, immediately after the murder. Why? In truth, he had
forgotten it. The automatic on the table had swept his own weapon
from his mind. He was not used to carrying more than one
gun&mdash;and that only in cases of emergency.</p>

<p>It would be easy to prove that the gun belonged to him. A
quick search of the records would show that he was licensed to
carry it. So far so good&mdash;but he would have to explain why
he had concealed, if only involuntarily, its presence on him.</p>

<p>"Well?" The short sharply-spoken word from the head of the
table broke the silence becoming oppressive.</p>

<p>"That is my gun," Bobby answered evenly.</p>

<p>"You carried it concealed in your clothing during the meeting
at which Sir Rupert was shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In fact, I had forgotten I had it on me."</p>

<p>"Rather an awkward pocket utensil?"</p>

<p>"I carry the gun in an holster strapped under my left
arm-pit."</p>

<p>"In true Western style?"</p>

<p>"It is convenient to carry it that way. As you say, Inspector,
it is a rather awkward pocket utensil."</p>

<p>"This, then, is the gun that shot Sir Rupert Haffervale."</p>

<p>"That will have to be proved. I cannot admit, nor deny
it."</p>

<p>"One cartridge is missing from the magazine. The gun has been
fired once."</p>

<p>"So you inform me."</p>

<p>"You admit that this is your gun."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That admission is serious. On it I could place you under
arrest on a charge of murder."</p>

<p>"You ask a question, Inspector, obtain your answer and then
warn me&mdash;is that the usual procedure?'"</p>

<p>For a second the detective was silent. A slight smile came and
went on his firm-set lips.</p>

<p>"You handed this gun to Mr. Preston?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the hall. About an hour or a little more after Sir
Rupert was shot."</p>

<p>"To get rid of the weapon with which you committed the
murder?"</p>

<p>"To my knowledge&mdash;or should I say, for lack of knowledge
that the gun had been fired&mdash;it was then fully loaded."</p>

<p>"For what reason did you hand the gun to Mr. Preston?"</p>

<p>"I proposed to return to the City that night. I thought
someone in the house should be armed. I asked Mr. Preston if he
owned a weapon and he said he did not. I then lent him my
gun."</p>

<p>"Lent it to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am rather fond of it if you remember, Inspector, it
was of rather important service to you and I one night in Surry
Hills."</p>

<p>"So that is the weapon." Williams' official manner relaxed
slightly. "You are certain that it had not been fired&mdash;that
the magazine was fully charged&mdash;when you handed it to Mr.
Preston?"</p>

<p>"I am quite certain. I cleaned and oiled the weapon and filled
the magazine before coming to Madlands on the morning of the
meeting."</p>

<p>"You had no personal animosity against Sir Rupert
Haffervale?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. He had always treated me very decently. In
fact, he had gone out of his way to keep in touch with myself and
my work at the <i>Mirror</i>. I always understood that I had a
firm friend in him&mdash;in a business sense, and
reciprocated."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Williams' nod was dismissal and Bobby returned to
his seat. Almost immediately the Inspector turned to the
secretary.</p>

<p>"Mr. Preston, this gun has not been out of your possession
since Mr. Trayne handed it to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You have not fired it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When Keston aroused you last night, with the information that
there were burglars in the house you brought this weapon
downstairs?"</p>

<p>"No, I forgot it."</p>

<p>"You were unarmed when you came downstairs&mdash;not even
aimed with the traditional British householder's poker."</p>

<p>"I was unarmed."</p>

<p>"Mr. Preston&mdash;" Williams leaned forward, almost eagerly;
then sat back at a rap on the door panel.</p>

<p>"I have the men here, sir," reported the plain-clothes
constable, who entered in response to the detective's
permission.</p>

<p>"Bring them in, please." The detective turned to the men
seated at the table. "I must apologise for having to introduce
certain outside matters into this meeting. For the present I do
not propose to go further into this inquiry. No," he interjected
at a movement on the part of Lord Carriday. "I want you all to
remain. In fact, to speak bluntly, you will all remain in your
seats until I give you permission to leave."</p>

<p>"This is absurd." Ibbotson levered himself to his feet. "I'm
not going to stand for it. Put that young scoundrel under arrest
and let us go about our business."</p>

<p>"I am conducting this inquiry, Mr. Ibbotson."</p>

<p>"I shall complain to your superiors."</p>

<p>"You will have an early opportunity. For the moment I intend
to hold you, pending a charge of attempted murder."</p>

<p>"Of a murderer." The big man laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Williams did not reply. He waited a few moments and then spoke
evenly.</p>

<p>"There are two murders being investigated. The murder of Sir
Rupert Haffervale and that of Mrs. Alice Mackenzie. Last night
Mr. Trayne reported to me a scene he had taken part in at the
abandoned gardener's cottage. Mr. Trayne reported to me a good
description of two men he found in the cottage. I ordered their
immediate arrest. I am informed that this has been accomplished.
I propose, therefore, to have the men brought here, to question.
First, I should like to ask Mr. Mackenzie certain questions. Are
you willing to answer me, fully and frankly, Mr. Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>Again fell the oppressive silence. Williams repeated his
question. Mackenzie looked up sharply, trying to catch Ibbotson's
eyes, but the big man kept his eyes down, on his fingers, playing
nervously on the tabletop.</p>

<p>"I will answer you." The chain-store magnate spoke slowly.</p>

<p>"You know of a certain&mdash;friendship&mdash;existing between
Sir Rupert Haffervale and your late wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You knew that a similar friendship had grown up between your
wife and Lord Carriday&mdash;superseding the friendship between
her and Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I know that your wife frequently met Lord Carriday at the
gardener's cottage?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You were outside the cottage the evening previous to Sir
Rupert's murder and watched your wife and Lord Carriday
enter?"</p>

<p>"I have no reason to deny that."</p>

<p>"You did not follow them into the cottage&mdash;create a
scene?"</p>

<p>"No. I had promised my wife a divorce. From then I considered
I had forfeited my right to interfere with her movements. In
fact, I was thoroughly sick of her carryings-on."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackenzie." The Inspector paused as the door opened and
the constable brought in two men. "Ah, Thompson, you have our
friends. Stand them at the foot of the table. So! Now, Mr.
Trayne, are these the men you saw in the cottage yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know them, Mr. Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>"They are the under-gardeners at Madlands. They helped carry
my wife from the cottage to her home."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trayne, when we discovered Mrs. Mackenzie in the cottage,
dead, you volunteered to get the gardeners at Madlands to carry
her to Treview. Did you do so?"</p>

<p>"I sent a messenger for them. At the time I was pursuing
another line of investigation and was pressed for time. When I
saw them yesterday at the cottage, I did not know they were
Madlands gardeners."</p>

<p>"Thank you." The Inspector turned to the men and obtained the
usual particulars. Again he turned to Bobby, "These men came to
the cottage yesterday to meet some one. Have you any knowledge of
whom that man is?"</p>

<p>"No. I have suspicions."</p>

<p>"Which are not evidence!" For a moment the detective was
silent. "Did you go to the cottage yesterday to meet these men,
Mr. Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>"I did not go to the cottage yesterday,"</p>

<p>"That is an evasion." Williams' spoke sharply. He turned to
the men. "Charles Rufus and Edward Thomas, I shall arrest you for
the wilful murder of Alice Mackenzie. I have to warn
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You arrest me?" Rufus leaned forward, questioningly. "You dud
of a john! Why don't you arrest the right man?"</p>

<p>"I warn you&mdash;" commenced Williams, but the man
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Here, hold hard a minute. Suppose a bloke may speak
sometimes. Now, just you listen to me."</p>

<p>The detective sat back, a slight smile on his lips. Bobby
thought he appeared pleased; that he had not intended to arrest
the man; that he was playing a game of big bluff.</p>

<p>"Talk if you wish to." The Inspector sat back, his hands
clasped on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"Well, me and my mate were working the day Sir Rupert was
shot, in the little gully south of the big house. It was hot
there and we got thirsty. We knew that someone used the old
cottage on the other side of the road and we knew that there was
stuff there."</p>

<p>"Stuff?"</p>

<p>"Drinks, if you want it that way. Well, as I was
saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment." Williams leaned forward. "Let me get a
connected tale. Some little while after Sir Rupert's murder Mrs.
Alice Mackenzie called here to see me." The detective addressed
the group around the table. "She told me that a very
extensive&mdash;friendship existed between Sir Rupert and
herself. She said nothing of the&mdash;er&mdash;friendship
between herself and Lord Carriday."</p>

<p>"I have not admitted that&mdash;friendship." Carriday spoke
quickly.</p>

<p>"I guessed it at the time that Mrs. Mackenzie was trying to
lay a smokescreen," Williams smiled. "I had occasion to watch the
lady go from this house and noticed that she turned up the road,
in the direction of the cottage, instead of back to Treview. I
also noticed that she was walking and from my observation of the
lady I considered that strange. Thus I was quite prepared to hear
that she had come from the gardener's cottage, after spending the
morning about Madlands, in disguise. Now, Rufus, you may continue
your story&mdash;if you want to. Remember, I have warned
you."</p>

<p>"Warned, be damned." Rufus laughed. "I'm going to get out of
this, and put someone else in. Get me? Well, listen.</p>

<p>"I said we were thirsty, if you like it that way. We went to
the cottage and found a couple of bottles of beer. We'd just got
into the bush again when we heard someone coming up the path from
the road. It was a man and he was carrying a girl. He went round,
to the back door and got into the cottage that way. I was curious
and persuaded Ted to wait and see."</p>

<p>"Presently, the man came out of the cottage and went down the
path to the road. Almost at the gate he met a woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?" Williams questioned sharply.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie&mdash;her that's dead."</p>

<p>"Who was the man who met her."</p>

<p>When the man hesitated Williams continued. "Look around this
room. Is he here?"</p>

<p>Immediately the man pointed to Lord Carriday.</p>

<p>"Then Lord Carriday met Mrs. Mackenzie outside the cottage?
Were they friendly?"</p>

<p>"They argued a bit." The man smiled. "She seemed anxious to go
to the cottage and he didn't appear to want her there. Not likely
considering the girl he had just carried there. Anyway, at last
he got her to walk through the bush with him. We followed."</p>

<p>"You had Mrs. Mackenzie in view from that moment to the time
of her death?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We found that there was another man watching her as well
as us. Ted saw him first and we had quite a job dodging him. Then
that man," he pointed to Carriday, "left her and the other man
came up to her. They weren't far from the cottage then. Well,
they just got round a clump of trees out of sight when we heard a
shot."</p>

<p>"Well, what, then?" Williams spoke, as the man hesitated.</p>

<p>"We saw him coming back with her in his arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mackenzie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the man who was carrying her&mdash;the man who was with
her when the shot was fired?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he was her husband&mdash;that man there!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">"AM I to consider myself under arrest?" Bobby
spoke as Inspector Williams passed the lounge on which he and
Myrtle were seated, some half hour after the scene in the
dining-room, that culminated in Godfrey Mackenzie's arrest for
the murder of his wife.</p>

<p>"Can't you see how you'll get anything less than a lifer,"
retorted Williams. "From the way you behave I can't say more than
you well deserve it. One thing, you won't have to serve your
sentence at Long Bay or any other well-known guest houses run by
the New South Wales Government. No, you'll have to live in
splendid misery."</p>

<p>"Kind of female prison?" Bobby mused.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know." The detective scratched his chin.
"There'll be a lady governor, that's a certainty," He turned to
Myrtle. "First act went over strong, Miss Haffervale. Gerald
Preston played up well, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Gerald?" Myrtle looked puzzled. "I don't think that you had
let him into the secret. Why, it was only as you seated yourself
in uncle's chair that you whispered to me not to be startled at
anything that might happen."</p>

<p>"Bobby in the role of the virtuous accused!" Williams
guffawed. "I had to laugh when I saw him standing at the foot of
the table, wearing the smile of injured innocence."</p>

<p>"But, what was it all about?" The girl questioned, greatly
puzzled. "Bobby says that it was true that he had the second
pistol, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he told me of lending it to Gerald," explained the
detective. "If he hadn't done that&mdash;well, there might have
been quite an aura of trouble around his curly head."</p>

<p>Bobby nodded.</p>

<p>"And my telling you was just an idle thought," he stated,
laughing. "Came into my mind last night, just after someone took
a pot-shot at me in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"I heard that shot." The girl shivered. "I was afraid to come
downstairs and see what had happened for, of course, I was not
supposed to be at Madlands. I sat up in bed and waited for Keston
to come and tell me what had happened."</p>

<p>"But he came to you immediately after the shot was fired,"
Bobby laughed.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" The girl looked astonished.</p>

<p>"Edgar Wallace&mdash;the mind of Mr. Reeder&mdash;and all that
sort of piffle. Guess, can't you, Williams? Well, don't you
remember remarking on the long interval between the shot and
Gerald and Keston coming downstairs to inquire what was
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" The detective raised his heavy eyebrows. "By Jove,
that's right. Keston going to Miss Haffervale gave Master Gerald
just the time he wanted to get upstairs and tuck himself in bed
again."</p>

<p>"That's so!" The young man wedged himself more comfortably
into the angle of the lounge. "Time, and to spare. Can't you
imagine our young friend lying in bed and wondering what was
happening down here&mdash;and waiting for Keston to come and
officially inform him of the shot in the dining-room. Why, he
must have developed grey hairs, wondering if the old man had
slept through it all. Almost put a kink into his plans."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Myrtle was frankly puzzled. "Bobby, you surely
are not accusing Gerald of shooting at you in the dining-room
last night."</p>

<p>"Just one shot, old dear," Bobby spoke sleepily. "Every dog's
entitled to one bite. I shan't object, unless I'm the one bitten.
Suppose every gun-owner's entitled to one catastrophe. Well, I
won't object unless I'm the catastrophe. Say, Williams, is every
murderer entitled to one victim on the same theory?"</p>

<p>"Don't know about that," The detective laughed. "But policemen
are allowed one whang at each newspaperman who talks nonsense.
Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't get Branston off his mind, Myrtle;" Bob spoke in a
false whisper. "Newspaper chap who called himself the Shadow
Crook. Baffled the police no end&mdash;and in consequence for
ever more, world without end, journalists are disgraced in the
Police Department eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Bobby." The girl laughed. "Don't take any notice
of him, Inspector. He's beginning to believe that he alone solved
the Madlands mysteries."</p>

<p>"There's still the shooting of Sir Rupert to explain."
Williams spoke in a low tone. "At present I can't see light.
There's no doubt that Gerald shot at Bobby last night, and then
assaulted me outside the dining-room door to obtain possession of
the bullet I'd dug out of the wainscoting. He confessed that the
gun had never been out of his possession and I found the bullet
in his room today. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To shoot across a dining-room full of people." Suddenly Bobby
sat upright. "Inspector, I've got a hunch."</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet, dragging the girl with him and ran into
the dining room. The detective followed more soberly. For some
moments the young man wandered about the big room studying the
small table from at angles. At length, he went and sat down at
it, taking the seat he had occupied during the meeting.</p>

<p>"Take that seat, Inspector!" He spoke imperatively. "The one
Gerald occupied. Now, Myrtle, will you take your seat at the big
table. Good! Ready!"</p>

<p>For some full minutes he sat back with closed eyes. Then he
commenced to speak in an undertone.</p>

<p>"The meeting has been on for some time. Sir Rupert has been
handing out one of the long, tedious speeches financial magnates
of this, the greatest city in the southern hemisphere, love to
inflict on suffering humanity. He has said piles of nice things
about his niece and ward, he has praised her beauty in the most
extravagant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Girls still wear pins, Bobby dear, although they have
abandoned hat pins." Myrtle spoke sweetly.</p>

<p>"My best period, blue pencilled," mourned the journalist. "I
see I have fallen under a permanent sub-editor with a ruthless
pencil. But let us proceed. Where was I? Ah&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Rupert has explained the truth of the Haffervale Trust.
He has proudly declared his beautiful and learned niece to be the
most bloated capitalist of Australia. He proposes that in token
of her assuming the sceptre of finance over the capital of the
southern lands and seas that she shall seat herself at the head
of this table. Gracefully he turns and half-bows&mdash;Say,
Williams, that was your cue to rise to your feet."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Of course! Blow out my best scene." Bobby spoke bitterly.
"Mix your clues; forget your lines. Haven't we rehearsed this
scene until&mdash;oh, get to your feet you&mdash;you
policeman!"</p>

<p>With a grin at the bewildered girl, Williams rose to his feet,
facing up the room. Bobby sprang from his chair, thrust the
detective aside, roughly, and ran up the room; to fall on his
knees beside the girl and hold her down in her chair. For a
minute he held the picture, then released the girl with a little
hug and pat. He turned to the astonished Inspector.</p>

<p>"Solved, oh future Commissioner of the New South Wales Police
Department!" he announced, with a flourish, "Robert Trayne, of
the <i>Mirror</i> staff, again traces a mystery to its
lair&mdash;if mysteries really possess anything so beastly."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I don't understand," blurted Williams.</p>

<p>"Neither do I." Bobby laughed at the expression on his
companion's faces. "But it is so! All we have to do now is to
find the gun."</p>

<p>"Easy to say that." The Inspector snorted. "If instead of all
that play-acting you'd told me where to find that gun, you'd have
done more good."</p>

<p>"The gun was here&mdash;you don't doubt that. Couldn't have
had the shot fired without the gun. You ask, then, where is it?"
For a long minute he studied the room and furniture, then turned
to the detective. "Say, Williams, you're certain I didn't kill
Sir Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;unless you had a third gun on you; The one you
lent Gerald wouldn't take that bullet. Now get on with your work,
you newspaper-sleuth, or confess for all time that you're a dud
detective."</p>

<p>"Where's Ibbotson?" demanded Bobby suddenly.</p>

<p>"In the library with Parsons and Carriday, signing papers."
Williams grinned broadly. "You've put the fear of little devils
into that bunch. Miss Haffervale. You and Bobby are considered
too dangerous to be free and alone so they're going to chain you
permanently together and load you down under tons of
gold&mdash;for the welfare of all good financial crooks that
choose to visit Sydney."</p>

<p>"Good!" In a couple of steps Bobby reached the door. "I'll be
back in second."</p>

<p>He was back in less than a minute, carrying Ibbotson's heavy
walking-stick. Again, in the dining-room, he examined it
carefully, testing the silver bands in every way.</p>

<p>"No-good, Bobby, I've been all over that," The detective
laughed. "I thought of Ibbotson's walking stick when you first
spoke of Gerald bringing it down to the chair beside you. There's
no gun in it. In fact, I believe the stick's solid wood, right
through."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it must&mdash;it must be." The journalist was
plainly puzzled. "The handle's just right. High bands, just in
the right place. It must be&mdash;it must be. And yet&mdash;it
isn't&mdash;it&mdash;<i>it is</i>!"</p>

<p>He brought the stick down with a powerful blow across his
knee. Just beneath the second band there appeared to be a
weakness in the wood, for it gave way with a splintering
sound.</p>

<p>A few seconds, and Bobby turned to face his companions,
pointing at the detective a long, slight, pistol, the trigger of
which was constructed so as to lie flat along the barrel.</p>

<p>"I see the scene now." The look of the dreamer had come again
on Bobby's face. "When Gerald rose from his seat he knocked down
Ibbotson's stick. There was nowhere to leave it up there so he
brought it with him to my table. He was nervous, excited, for he
knew something of the revelations Sir Rupert proposed to make
that morning. He sat in that chair, playing idly with the stick.
In some way he touched the spring and the handle containing the
pistol came apart from the stick."</p>

<p>"But why did you rush from your table to me, Bobby?" asked the
girl, curiously.</p>

<p>"Work of the sub-conscious brain, old dear. Gerald must have
found the pistol and some little devil was whispering in his ear
to shoot and end the trouble. Perhaps I overheard that whisper;
anyway, I was told you were in danger. I jumped to you and that
gave Gerald his chance. The confusion my movements caused covered
him effectively. When he had fired the shot and had seen Sir
Rupert fall he jammed the pistol back into the stick and dropped
it under the table."</p>

<p>"Well!" The Inspector gasped. "I'd have sworn that stick was
solid right through."</p>

<p>"So it was after the shot was fired," Bobby laughed. "Gerald
bungled in putting that pistol into the stick again. Didn't get
it in the right way or something. Anyhow he had to close it down
by brute force and of course broke the spring, or put it out of
action. When you examined the stick Williams, it was as solid as
an iron rod. Then, you satisfied and the stick standing in the
dining-room unguarded and unwanted, Ibbotson walks in and
unconsciously walks away with it. Jove, what a story!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The detective took the fragments of the stick and
examined them carefully. "Sure, Bobby, you've solved the mystery.
Well, well, who'd have thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Strange, but true!" A moment and Bobby took his arm and led
the Inspector gently but firmly to the door. "Williams, will you
convey my apologies to Mr. Adam Ibbotson for smashing his stick
in demonstrating how well the contents were used. Tell him
I'll buy him the finest walking-stick in Sydney, tomorrow, as a
thanks-offering. But before I leave for the city I have one more
job, a very important one, to tackle."</p>

<p>"And that?" Williams looked perplexed. "We're solved all the
mysteries, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"We have solved many, this last couple of days, comrade."
Bobby's hand gently urged the detective into the hall. "Now I
have to solve the greatest mystery of all&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"The exact date of my wedding-day&mdash;you blanketty-born
idiot."</p>

<p>Then he shut the door softly&mdash;but very firmly.</p>
