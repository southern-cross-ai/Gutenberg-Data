  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; DUFF GREGOR</h2>

  <p class="first">Duff Gregor left the town of Piute on the run. It was not
  the first town which he had left with speed. In fact, he knew all about ways
  of leaving towns. He had left on foot, on horseback, in the blind baggage,
  and riding the rods. He had left a Mexican town, one day, tied face down on a
  wild horse; Mexicans are sure to serve up novelties. He had left more than
  one town riding a rail, and on two occasions wearing a coat of tar and
  feathers. The exit from Piute, as a matter of fact, had been rather a lucky
  one.</p>

  <p>The reason lay in a card game. Most of Gregor's ups and downs in life
  sprang from cards. This time he had just cut in a cold pack of his own in an
  interesting little game when the jack pot was piled high in the center of the
  table. And then a man drew a gun.</p>

  <p>Gregor knew what the glare in the eyes and the sudden hunching of the
  shoulders meant. He was prepared out of the stores of old experience for just
  such gestures and attitudes, and for that reason he carried deep in a coat
  pocket a little two-barreled pistol, one of those silly, old-fashioned
  affairs that have the barrels built one on top of the other. It was a very
  short gun. At twenty paces it shot wild and hardly with force enough to break
  bones. But it looked no bigger than a tobacco pouch, say, and it threw a big
  slug. At a distance no greater than the width of a table it did real
  execution.</p>

  <p>In this case its bullet sent the fellow who had reached for a gun toppling
  back out of his chair with a scream of agony. Duff Gregor was no fool with a
  gun. He had shot straight under the table with the first bullet. With the
  second, his hand now raised, he hit the light that hung from the ceiling in
  the back room of that hotel, and in the dark confusion that followed, he
  scraped the stakes off the table, kicked open a door, and got to a horse
  reasonably ahead of the other men in the card game.</p>

  <p>He was not entirely ahead of their bullets, however, and when he was five
  miles out of Piute, that poor mustang began to fail and falter. When Gregor
  dismounted to look for causes, he discovered that the poor game animal had
  run all that distance hard and true while the life-blood was leaking out of
  it through a bullet wound.</p>

  <p>Gregor was interested, but not touched. He cursed that pony for playing
  out on him, stripped off saddle and bridle, and did not waste an extra bullet
  to put the lost mustang out of its last agonies. Duff Gregor was a practical
  man, and he hated wasted gestures of sentimentality.</p>

  <p>He was sufficiently practical, however, to know the value of carrying the
  saddle, the bridle, and the forty-foot hempen rope, for on the range he might
  come across another horse, and if he did, he would not stop to ask who owned
  it. He was not at all foolishly particular about such matters.</p>

  <p>A range saddle is a heavy burden. A range bridle is not a light weight,
  and even forty feet of rope weighs something. But Duff Gregor turned himself
  into a plodding pack animal and endured his labor patiently. He had
  qualities, Duff Gregor, and the ability to make the best of a bad moment was
  one of them.</p>

  <p>What he wanted most of all was to get distance between himself and Piute.
  He wanted the blue of a certain mountain range to the west between him and
  the thought of the angry citizens of that town, but he was well into the
  foothills before he saw a horse at hand.</p>

  <p>He climbed a hill, looked down into a little valley where there was wood,
  water, and plenty of grass, and in the middle of that place he saw a chestnut
  stallion that looked able to jump over the moon if he heard so much as a
  whisper in the tall grass. He was shining like metal, that stallion. The
  westering sun made the gold of him burn.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor worked his way around until he was directly down-wind from the
  horse, and stalked with care for a full hot hour. When he came closer, he
  raised his head near the tops of the high grass and made out that there was
  no sweaty mark of bridle strap or saddle blanket on the horse; neither was
  there a saddle gall to patch with white the smooth gold of the stallion's
  back.</p>

  <p>A wild horse? Well, if that was the case, Duff Gregor would find himself
  hitched to a comet, perhaps. But he had plenty of nerve. He had an extra
  share of courage that might have been dished out to make a sufficient portion
  for three ordinary men.</p>

  <p>He had left the saddle and bridle, as meaningless encumbrances, farther up
  the hill. Now he went on, stealthily, making a noose in the rope. He was very
  close before the snort of the stallion warned him that his approach might
  have been discovered. Then, peering cautiously through the higher heads of
  the grass, he made out the golden stallion on guard, with head and tail high,
  and the look of a creature capable of bounding into the air and taking wing
  above the mountains at any moment.</p>

  <p>Gregor rose out of that grass with a beautiful underhand cast of the rope,
  a trick that he had learned in Mexico in the old days. The noose settled fair
  and true around the neck of the big horse as he turned.</p>

  <p>But he was a wild horse, apparently. The burn of the rope as he pulled
  taut had not stopped the stallion. Instead, he went off as fast as he could
  leg it with seventeen hands of muscle and bone. In the very end of the rope a
  snarl hooked around the leg of Gregor, who was snaked off his feet and
  skidded away through the grass with such speed that the blades stung his
  hands and face.</p>

  <p>Unless he killed that stallion, he would be dragged to death. He got hold
  of his gun just as he was dragged through a patch of brush, and the Colt
  exploded vainly in the air as it was torn out of his grasp. The speed of the
  stallion was tremendous by this time. Life was, for Duff Gregor, a blur of
  green and blue that darted past his eyes altogether too fast for him to make
  sure he was alive and a creature capable of thought.</p>

  <p>Then a man's voice called out. The terrific speed diminished. It
  ceased.</p>

  <p>Gregor rose staggering to his feet and, with spinning sight, saw before
  him an image, very blurred, of the golden stallion coming eagerly to the hand
  of a tall man, who was saying: "Steady, boy. Steady, Parade."</p>

  <p>Gregor had the rope off his leg, by this time, and the sound of the
  horse's name knocked the last of his dizziness out of his wits.</p>

  <p>"Parade?" he shouted. "Is that Parade?"</p>

  <p>He pointed. The great horse stood at the side of his master, staring at
  the stranger with blazing eyes. The man was big, with heavy, capable
  shoulders and a body strung out lean and sinewy as that of an Indian runner
  below the chest. He had a big head and a big, brown, handsome face.</p>

  <p>"This is Parade," he was saying. "Are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Parade?" echoed Gregor. "Then you're Arizona Jim&mdash;you're Jim
  Silver!"</p>

  <p>"I can't say 'No' to that," replied the other.</p>

  <p>Gregor was not easily amused, but now he broke into rather wild
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't I do it?" he cried, when he was able to speak again. "Wouldn't I
  try to rope a Parade? Wouldn't it be my luck to run into that horse in a
  range all filled with mustangs?"</p>

  <p>Silver said nothing, and suddenly Gregor was explaining.</p>

  <p>"There wasn't a mark of a saddle or a bridle on him. No saddle gall. I
  thought he was a wild one, Silver." He advanced, holding out his hand. "Name
  is Duff Gregor," he said. "Sorry I daubed the rope on your stallion, Silver.
  My mustang is in a junk heap, 'way back yonder."</p>

  <p>Silver took his hand freely. Gregor noted that. There was no hesitation.
  Considering the number of men who would have been glad to freeze onto the gun
  hand of such a man and pump lead into him at the same instant, this might
  have appeared rather strange, had it not been that Gregor knew perfectly well
  that Silver was about as good with the left hand as with the right. And there
  he stood, shaking hands with Jim Silver!</p>

  <p>Little worms of ice wriggled up and down his spine. It would be something
  to tell his cronies, that he had stood face to face with that perennial and
  terrible enemy of gun fighters and thugs in general. That he had looked into
  the face and the eyes of this eagle who preyed on hawks only. That he had
  held the hand of Jim Silver and had seen the scars that streaked his
  skin.</p>

  <p>Yes, the story was true. There were a dozen&mdash;no, there were twenty
  little gleams of brightness in the face of Silver. Bullets had cut the flesh
  or drilled through it. Knives had done their share. Such danger as he had
  made his bedfellow could not be endured for many years without leaving its
  marks.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was a whole pattern of war on the face of Jim Silver, very
  dimly sketched in, to be sure, but visible to a keen eye when the slant light
  of such a sun as this fell straight against the skin.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor pumped that terrible hand three times, and with each gesture
  he thought of the number of times the thumb that now pressed the back of his
  knuckles had fanned the hammer of a revolver and sent death into the hearts
  of greater men than Duff Gregor would ever claim to be.</p>

  <p>He could see that everything he had heard was true, and from the gesture,
  the voice, of this man, he knew that his modesty was as great as his
  daredevil courage. He was one of those quiet fellows who fight their battles
  only once and forget the past before their revolvers are cold. That was Jim
  Silver. An unwilling admiration and an envious, grim passion rose in the
  heart of the card cheat, gunman, and general crook.</p>

  <p>It was unfair that there should be such a fellow on the face of the earth.
  Ordinarily, one could say that the so-called "good" men simply lacked the
  courage to take chances and get illegal gains. But one or two such fellows as
  Jim Silver were enough to explode the theory. He loved a square deal as he
  loved danger.</p>

  <p>"By thunder, Jim," said Gregor, "there's something about you! Maybe I've
  seen your picture before, but it looks to me as though I've known you,
  somewhere!"</p>

  <p>"Does it?" asked Jim Silver, with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor had heard of that smile, too, the faintness of it which was
  rarely brightened or dimmed by circumstances. No man who wore that smile
  could be called a habitually happy man. Gregor was savagely glad of it. He
  heard Silver continuing:</p>

  <p>"You've looked in your mirror and you know yourself, Gregor. And we're a
  lot alike."</p>

  <p>"You mean that?" exclaimed Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Of course. We're about of a build, and our faces are a good deal alike.
  We could pass for brothers, Gregor, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Brothers?</p>

  <p>Gregor thought of a past that ranged from sneak thieving to cheating at
  cards and an occasional plain stick-up; he thought of the long record of the
  brave and honorable actions of Silver, and a chilly shudder went through him.
  Yes, it was true that they looked very much alike, if one could read only
  skin deep.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be hanged!" said Gregor, gasping.</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Silver, and his smile was fainter than ever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; STAGE HOLDUP</h2>

  <p class="first">They camped together. Duff Gregor never forgot that
  occasion. He never forgot his bewilderment when, at Silver's chosen point on
  the runlet of water, the fire was built and a bit of fresh venison was
  started roasting after it had been cut into convenient chunks and spitted on
  bits of wood, for then he discovered that Jim Silver traveled through the
  land with no further provision than a rifle, salt, and matches!</p>

  <p>"Why," said Gregor, "a wild goose couldn't fly no lighter than that! How
  d'you bed yourself down, brother?"</p>

  <p>"I have a blanket and a slicker," said Silver.</p>

  <p>It was true. One threadbare blanket and a slicker; that was all.</p>

  <p>"When I have to move, I generally have to move fast&mdash;and sometimes
  rather far," explained Silver.</p>

  <p>That was true, also. A thousand crooks of all sorts and sizes, most of
  them dangerous, because Silver never bothered with small fry, were constantly
  on the lookout for opportunities to revenge themselves on this man.</p>

  <p>Many a time, according to legend, they had banded together and, in full
  power, hunted Jim Silver north and south and east and west. Parade was what
  beat them, and when they scattered, Parade bore his master on the back trail
  until some two or three of the pursuers had paid for their rashness as much
  as man can pay. These man hunts had grown unpopular, therefore, among
  Silver's greatest enemies.</p>

  <p>But it was more than the need to escape enemies or the will to hunt them
  down that made Silver fly light. Men said that he could not find continued
  happiness in any one spot, as though there were a curse upon him, and he was
  forced to rove endlessly. Or perhaps he was seeking happiness as other men
  seek for gold, and never finding more than the brief content that comes from
  action.</p>

  <p>There were other reasons, later on, why Gregor could never forget the
  evening, or the picture of the calm, quiet face of Jim Silver. He had sense
  enough not to turn the conversation on the past, or to try to make Silver
  talk about his exploits. He knew the man's reputation for taciturnity in all
  that concerned his own feats. But he found that Silver would talk readily
  enough in a deep, pleasantly flowing voice. What he liked to describe were
  his journeys through the mountains or across the deserts, and the strange men
  he had met&mdash;old pioneers, squatters, Indians&mdash;who partook of the
  nature of the wilderness and of the frontier life.</p>

  <p>Silver went to bed early. He simply took his blanket and slicker and went
  off, after he had first cut a good soft bed of evergreen boughs and saplings
  for Gregor.</p>

  <p>"I have to keep in the open," said Silver. "People could sneak up on me,
  if I stayed in cover like this. But out in the open Parade takes care of me.
  And I've learned to sleep warm enough with one blanket and a
  slicker&mdash;even in the snow."</p>

  <p>He went out, in fact, on the bare flat of the valley, and there gaping
  Gregor saw him lie down, while the great stallion ranged to and fro.</p>

  <p>No doubt Parade himself lay down before morning, but the last Gregor saw
  of the picture Parade was still moving about, now and then nibbling the
  grass, and again throwing up his head to study the far horizon and all of the
  unseen dangers of sound and scent that blew to him down the wind.</p>

  <p>Well, it would take a clever man to stalk Jim Silver under conditions like
  these. But not even for the devotion of a matchless horse like that would
  Duff Gregor have changed conditions with Silver, and not for all the fame
  that rang in the ears of men. To eat like a wild hawk, and live like a wild
  hawk&mdash;that was not for Gregor!</p>

  <p>How could Jim Silver enter a town without being aware, every instant, that
  danger might leap at him from every doorway, that guns might fire from every
  window? How could he sit in peace, except with two walls of a room guarding
  his back? What, in fact, did life mean to such a man, except the arduous
  pursuit of glory, unendingly?</p>

  <p>Gregor had asked during the evening: "D'you like it, Jim? D'you like
  living this sort of a life&mdash;traveling with no coffee, no flour, no
  bacon, no cooking pans, no nothing?"</p>

  <p>And Silver had said: "Well, it makes everything more simple. I used to
  carry not even salt, but I've added that. I guess I'm getting old and soft.
  But you can look at it this way, Duff: Wherever you go, no matter on what
  desert, there's always life of some sort. There aren't very many desert jack
  rabbits, but there are some. Wherever you go, you'll find game, if you hunt
  carefully for it. And if you miss food for a couple of days, it makes it
  taste all the better when you make a kill."</p>

  <p>It was a very simple philosophy, but it made the heart of Duff Gregor grow
  small. For himself, he preferred a little more fat, a little more comfort, a
  little less glory, if need be. But to think of lying down every night without
  the certainty that the day would ever dawn again&mdash;that the bark of a gun
  or the cold agony of steel buried in the throat might not be the end of the
  world!</p>

  <p>No wonder that this man had been able to run even the great criminal name
  of Barry Christian out of the world, and broken him utterly, and his gang,
  too, so that one heard nothing of Christian in these days.</p>

  <p>It might be that Christian was dead. It might be that, a broken man, he
  was cooking for some obscure cattle ranch. But no wonder that Silver had
  beaten him, for the man was all edge. He was all cutting edge: he could not
  fail to win.</p>

  <p>When Gregor rose in the morning, the fire had already been rekindled by
  Silver, and they had for breakfast the same as they had had the night before.
  At least, Gregor had it.</p>

  <p>"Roast meat and cold water," he said. "How d'you stand it? Ain't it
  monotonous?"</p>

  <p>"You see," said Silver, "when I'm on the range, I eat only once a day, and
  then I'm so hungry that I'm never tired of meat. And I'm so thirsty that
  water tastes better than wine."</p>

  <p>That day he took Gregor across the mountains through the first pass. In
  the middle of the day he showed him a patch of houses on the other side of a
  valley.</p>

  <p>"That's Allerton," said Silver. "The stage from Crow's Nest runs there. If
  you want to move on, you can get the stage. Any money?"</p>

  <p>There was plenty of money in the pocket of Gregor, but he had no objection
  to taking more. He said that unluckily he was broke.</p>

  <p>Silver took a sheaf of five twenties out of his pocket and handed them
  over. There was very little left of his roll after he had made this
  contribution. He was easy. It was no wonder that he could not keep the
  fortunes which he had made several times, because everyone knew that he could
  not say "No." He was so easy that it was hard for Gregor to keep from
  laughing in his face.</p>

  <p>There was a good wind blowing up the valley, and Silver had taken off his
  hat to enjoy the coolness of it, and Gregor saw above the temples the two
  spots of gray hair like horns beginning to push through the hair. Men said
  that that was how he had first got his name of "Silver-tip" or "Silver."</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and then Gregor marched down the slope and up the other
  side. Before he had gone far on his way, Silver had disappeared. The great
  waste of the mountains had received him again. Where would he reappear? Only
  where the needs of some unlucky man or the outrage committed by some criminal
  called him out of his quiet seclusion.</p>

  <p>Gregor climbed on into Allerton, went into the first saloon, and leaned a
  heavy elbow on the bar until he had poured three drinks under his belt. After
  that, he was able to stop thinking.</p>

  <p>"To blazes with Jim Silver!" he said under his breath, and went to a
  restaurant to find food. Finally, when he had well filled himself, the
  thought of that lonely soul who drifted through mountains hunting for
  happiness with a deathless and futile hope grew dim in his brain.</p>

  <p>He looked over Allerton, decided that it offered few opportunities for a
  man of his genius, and, therefore, took the two-o'clock stage for Crow's
  Nest, which was far off in the blue of the next range toward the west. Crow's
  Nest was a big town, a booming town, men told him. There were mines not far
  from it. Lumbering went on near by. Moreover, a certain number of tenderfeet
  were attracted by the mineral waters of a hot spring that bubbled up in the
  center of the town, and a good many sick people were constantly in Crow's
  Nest, taking a cure.</p>

  <p>It was exactly the sort of a spot that Gregor liked to haunt, for wherever
  you find invalids, you find reckless spending. No one, he knew, spends so
  much money having a good time as the man who expects that he may be dead
  before morning. The death house atmosphere of such a town would be exactly
  suited to the peculiar talents of Gregor.</p>

  <p>So he took the two-o'clock stage and found himself with six other
  passengers. Every one of them seemed to be a step up from the average
  population of Allerton. Their baggage looked like "money inside."</p>

  <p>When he was sure of this, he felt more at ease than ever. It was a new
  part of the range, for him. He had never been within five hundred miles of it
  before he had come to Piute, and Duff Gregor liked new things. He liked new
  faces, new whisky, new money, and new guns. He liked everything new except
  new jails.</p>

  <p>He felt that this world is a comfortable place. The sun was a shade more
  brilliant, more warm, more pleasing to the soul, with its golden radiance,
  than ever before. It shone alike upon the just and the unjust, but he felt
  that the unjust had just an edge of advantage. How many crooks in this world,
  for instance, could say that they had twice eaten food cooked by the
  immortal, man-slaying hands of Jim Silver, lived with him for a day, and
  parted from him a hundred dollars up?</p>

  <p>It was only fifty miles to Crow's Nest. The first part of the journey spun
  out behind the heels of the galloping horses at the rate of fifteen miles an
  hour, but the long up-tug toward the town in the next range had to be taken
  at a walk, and the afternoon had worn away toward sunset, with the sun
  drifting beside them like fire in the branches of the pine trees, and the
  sweeter scent and the cooler breath of evening was already coming into the
  air when, as they turned a corner, a rifle shot clanged like two heavy sledge
  hammers struck face to face.</p>

  <p>The near leader of the team dropped dead. From behind a rock rose the head
  and shoulders of a masked man who was peering down a very steady rifle.</p>

  <p>"Stick 'em up, boys," he said. "Keep 'em right over your heads. Try to
  touch the sky all the time, and step out on this side, please. Driver, watch
  yourself, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rifle spat thin smoke. Its muzzle jerked. The driver cursed and
  grabbed his right shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said the highwayman. "You shouldn't have made that move,
  brother."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking his professional manner. Gregor and all the rest
  gave up hope of resistance on the spot. Nothing discourages action so much as
  the sight of blood. Gregor was muttering quietly, "My rotten luck!" as he
  climbed out to the ground and stood in line with the others.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; BARRY CHRISTIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">The stage driver seemed to be a fool. He insisted on going
  forward to look at his near leader. The masked man warned him grimly:</p>

  <p>"Brother, if you budge one more step, I'll shoot a few inches inside that
  first slug."</p>

  <p>The driver turned and scowled at him. He was a big fellow, that driver. He
  had rusty red hair and a big, saber-shaped mustache.</p>

  <p>"I ain't got a gun," he said. "I was reachin' for a chaw of tobacco a
  while back, not for a gun. Go and fan me for a Colt, if you wanta, but I
  gotta see if you been and murdered Molly."</p>

  <p>With that, he walked right past the leveled gun of the robber and went to
  the dead horse. The rifle of the masked man hesitated just as his mind must
  have hesitated. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right, old-timer. Now, boys, kindly turn your backs, while
  I make a change."</p>

  <p>The "change" consisted of tossing the rifle aside and at the same instant
  pulling out a revolver. This weapon he held only hip-high and did not aim
  with his eye on the sights. There were no sights, in fact, and instead of
  curving a forefinger around the trigger, the right thumb of the robber rested
  on the hammer of his gun. It was perfectly plain that here was a fellow who
  knew how to fan a revolver, and such men are not the ones to take liberties
  with.</p>

  <p>Everybody in that party seemed sufficiently experienced to know all about
  the trick and the quality of the man who can perform it. Not one of the
  passengers attempted violence with the robber. All turned their backs
  obediently, and the highwayman went down the line, clapping the muzzle of the
  gun against the spinal columns, while with a marvelously rapid left hand he
  "frisked" every pocket. No pocket, in fact, was too secret for him to find
  it. He threw on the ground everything he secured&mdash;guns, wallets,
  knives&mdash;except the big, fat gold watches, which he dropped into his own
  pockets. He found stickpins and gold cuff links. Everything was secured with
  wonderful skill and rapidity by this master hand.</p>

  <p>Then he told the youngest of the party to climb up behind the stage and
  cut the straps that held the baggage. Down into the road tumbled the luggage.
  A cloud of dust rose, and with it groans from two or three of the unlucky
  passengers.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, boys," said the robber. "I have to go through this stuff to see
  what's what, but nothing is going to be spoiled on purpose. I want valuables,
  not clothes, and if you'll send back here for the stuff after an hour, you'll
  collect what's left. If anyone tries to come back before an hour, I'll show
  him that when I touched the driver on the shoulder, I was doing it on
  purpose&mdash;not missing my mark. I'm a man of a quiet temper, fellows, but
  I'm apt to lose hold of myself if any of you rush back to this place. Driver,
  cut loose that off leader. He only imbalances your team now, and besides I
  need him."</p>

  <p>The driver, without a word, unhooked the off leader, pulled the harness
  off it with his left hand&mdash;the right hung helpless from his wounded
  shoulder&mdash;and unhooked the double-trees from the fifth chain. Then he
  paused and looked down at the dead gray mare.</p>

  <p>"There's a mare," said the driver, "that never said 'No.' There's a mare
  that knew every curve of the road from here to Crow's Nest. I been drunk
  behind her, and she's made better time when I was drunk than when I was
  sober. If a gent had the sense to use the brake, she had the sense to take
  the curves. There's a mare, boys, that was a lady, and I loved her."</p>

  <p>He came back toward the stage. One of the men offered to tie up his
  wound.</p>

  <p>He answered: "Climb up there and haul on the brake for me, when I speak
  up. I'll take care of the line. I don't need no doctor till I get to Crow's
  Nest. I dunno that I wanta be touched by any one of the seven skunks that'll
  let one crook stick 'em up. There's too much yaller poison in your systems. I
  wouldn't wanta risk some of it runnin' into mine."</p>

  <p>Tears were on his face as he spoke. He let them roll, unheeded. He climbed
  back into the seat, and the rest of the men prepared to follow. The youngster
  of the lot got up to handle the brake. Then the voice of the robber said:</p>

  <p>"You, there&mdash;back up! You stay with me!"</p>

  <p>All turned. The muzzle of the revolver definitely picked out Duff Gregor
  from the lot.</p>

  <p>"You want me?" exclaimed Gregor, with a chill in his soul.</p>

  <p>"You!" said the robber. "And keep your hands up! If you try to move, I'll
  plaster you. You fool, I know you!" What did that mean?</p>

  <p>With dull eyes, Gregor watched the stage start off. With ringing ears, he
  heard the departing curses which the passengers hurled behind them at the
  robber.</p>

  <p>The masked man knew him? Well, there was a great deal in this life of
  Gregor. There was enough to fill ten columns of fine print, and nothing but
  facts mentioned. Some victim of a card game, someone who had been "rolled" by
  Gregor when the victim was drunk?</p>

  <p>The stage rumbled out of view behind the next bend of the road. Then the
  highwayman came up and shoved the muzzle of his revolver into Duff's middle.
  He said, in a voice which emotion made ring like a bell: "I've had you in my
  hands twice. This is the third time, and it's the last. Don't you know
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know you," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>There was silence.</p>

  <p>"You're changed," said the highwayman. "You're almost so changed that I
  wouldn't know you. But I really believe that you don't recognize me. If I
  were you, I'd know by the voice alone, but if you want to see my face, take a
  look at it, Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>With that he ripped the mask away.</p>

  <p>Gregor's starting eyes stared into a finely made face, a long, handsome
  face. It had a sensitive, a mobile and almost delicate look, except that
  there was something infinitely cruel about the mouth and the bright, steady
  eyes. And the long, silken hair flowed back after the style that so many
  artists affect.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look so good to you, Jim, eh?" said the stranger. "It doesn't
  seem possible that the great Jim Silver would shove up his hands in a
  stage-coach and let any one man rob him, eh? But here you stand, ten seconds
  from death, Jim! I can't believe that it's the end of the long trail, at
  last. And if I hang for this tomorrow, I'll die a happy man!"</p>

  <p>And Gregor knew, with wonderful certainty, that he was, in fact, hardly a
  scant ten seconds away from the future world. He had to think fast, and his
  mind was luckily one that fear stimulated and did not benumb.</p>

  <p>"Brother," he said, "you got me wrong. I've got a shadow over my face just
  now, but lemme turn west into the light, and then see if I wear the scars of
  Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" said the other, and started violently.</p>

  <p>He took Gregor by the left shoulder and turned him hastily toward the
  west, where the light fell more closely on his face. Then he snarled with
  disgust and rage.</p>

  <p>"I should have known!" he said. "I should have guessed it wasn't Jim
  Silver standing for a one-man play like mine. But who gave you a face so much
  like his?"</p>

  <p>"Brother," said Gregor, "my face may be like his, but I've never made one
  phony dime out of the resemblance."</p>

  <p>"It's not so like, either, now that I take another look," said the robber.
  "I suppose that hope was making me blind. But," he added, "you're close
  enough to turn your face into a mint! At least, it would be good for a
  million in this part of the world!"</p>

  <p>"Because I look like Silver?" said Gregor. "Hold on, old-timer. A little
  confidence work, you mean? Maybe, in the end, I'm going to be glad that you
  stopped that stage. All at once some ideas seem to begin to soak into my
  brain."</p>

  <p>There was silence between them, each man reading the mind of the
  other.</p>

  <p>"What's your lay?" asked the robber shortly.</p>

  <p>"Anything," said Duff Gregor, with a frankness which he felt would do him
  no harm, under the circumstances. "Anything from a jimmy to a gun is good
  enough for me, and I know how to make a mold with yellow soap and run the
  soup in it, if you come to cases."</p>

  <p>There followed another silence, then the stranger asked: "Have you got an
  idea who I am?"</p>

  <p>"Not the foggiest idea," said Gregor. "You might be Barry Christian, for
  all I know."</p>

  <p>"Might be?" said the other. "Everyone knows my face has been published up
  and down the land. Everyone knows the publishing of it&mdash;and Silver's
  dirty work&mdash;has started me on the road like a common tramp of a stick-up
  artist. But if you have half an eye in your head, you'll see that I am
  Christian."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; A FOUNDATION STONE</h2>

  <p class="first">Afterward, they sat by a fire twenty miles away, on the
  farther side of Crow's Nest. Christian had had his own mount of course, and
  the stage line horse had carried Gregor from the scene of the hold-up. Those
  twenty miles, Barry Christian had insisted upon, and Gregor knew better than
  to dispute the will or the way of that famous man. For Barry Christian was a
  master of the art of breaking the law with impunity, as he had proved many
  times during the long course of his celebrated career. No penalties had
  fallen to his share, except those which had become his through that still
  greater man, Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>It had not taken long for Christian and Gregor to come to an agreement.
  One of the most amazing parts of the affair was the speed with which
  Christian looked through the mind of his new acquaintance. It was as though
  he knew all about the furnishings of the mind of Gregor and exactly how far
  Gregor would go. He repeatedly turned his back on Gregor, as he was working
  about the campfire or attending to the horses.</p>

  <p>That was a risky business, because, no matter how awed Gregor might be by
  the reputation of his new friend, it was also true that there were fifteen
  thousand dollars on the head of Barry Christian. And for the cost of one
  little leaden bullet, all of that fortune would be transferred to the hands
  of Gregor!</p>

  <p>It would not take much&mdash;a flick of the hand and a jerk of the thumb
  or forefinger, and Barry Christian and all his famous past and all of his
  great deeds would lie dead on the ground. It would not only make Gregor rich
  for the time being, but it would swell his reputation into a formidable size.
  His own past would be forgiven. He would be mentioned in every newspaper.
  Reporters would travel three thousand miles for the sake of shaking his hand
  and snapping his picture, and picking up a few of his wise sayings. Men would
  write the story of his life, adroitly covering over the evil, and changing
  sheer crime into clear adventure, for this is undoubtedly true&mdash;that the
  world loves an adventurer and has an almost unsurpassable wish to believe
  well of him.</p>

  <p>These conclusions kept working in the mind of Gregor, but still his hand
  was held. The same thought had been in his mind when he was with Jim Silver,
  to tell the truth. To be known as the slayer of Silver would give him a vast
  name among crooks all over the world. But a certain freezing awe had numbed
  the powers of his hand, when he thought of murdering Silver. It was a similar
  awe that prevented him from attacking the great Barry Christian, and it
  annoyed him to see that Christian seemed to understand his superiority and
  that the outlaw was able to count on it.</p>

  <p>After a time, the irritation passed out of the mind of Gregor. He was
  soothed and pleased by what he could call his great good luck. Fate, he
  considered, does not mean badly by the man whom he brings to the side of Jim
  Silver one night, and Barry Christian the next. It even occurred to Gregor
  that it was like one of the old legends in which the hero is brought to the
  crossing of the ways and told to select either the straight and narrow path
  or the rosy way to evil. Gregor had two sorts of life to choose
  from&mdash;that of Jim Silver or that of Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt in his mind as to which course he would take. The mere
  thought of Silver's way of existence made an arctic ache of cold grip his
  soul, but with Barry Christian he lolled in comfort. He understood the man
  more nearly.</p>

  <p>For one thing, Christian was not the fellow to live like an ascetic. He
  brought out a good cooking set of pots and pans, and he prepared as
  delightful a supper as one could ask for in a camp. There was even pan bread,
  instead of tooth-cracking hardtack.</p>

  <p>What pleased Gregor more than the good food was the pleasant manner of
  Barry Christian. The man's handsome, mobile face was continually smiling, and
  his soft voice was a music in the ears of Gregor. Also, Christian talked with
  disarming frankness.</p>

  <p>As they smoked cigarettes and sipped the good strong coffee which
  Christian had made, while the firelight tossed far-traveling gleams through
  the corridors of the pines and a troubled squirrel came out to argue angrily
  from a branch above, Christian said:</p>

  <p>"You see that I've dropped a long distance downhill, Gregor. I'm reduced
  to common stick-up work, these days. I used to do better things. I used to be
  able to sit back and plan real jobs in a real manner. But that's changed.
  D'you know why?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver broke me," said Christian, looking Gregor straight in the eye.
  "He beat me twice, and the second time that he smashed me, all my old men
  lost confidence in me. It began to look to them as though I were no good for
  rainy weather. They got out from under. However, I managed to make out."</p>

  <p>He had been sorting the loot that he had collected from the stage, as he
  talked. It had been a pretty good haul, on the whole. After the suit-cases
  had been searched&mdash;and then, according to promise, neatly reclosed and
  stacked beside the road&mdash;there was a total of over five thousand dollars
  in hard cash, to say nothing of a good heap of watches and stickpins and
  other jewelry. Christian put a thousand dollars and a portion of the
  "hardware" into the hands of Gregor.</p>

  <p>"What for?" asked Gregor, gasping.</p>

  <p>"You were on hand for the finish," said Christian. "I always make a split
  with anyone who's on my side."</p>

  <p>"On your side? I would have plastered you with a ton of lead, if I'd seen
  my chance," said Gregor frankly.</p>

  <p>"That was before we really knew one another," answered Christian. "Don't
  argue, Gregor. You're in the game with me, and you're welcome to a split. It
  isn't hard cash that I look for so much as other things, in this work. I
  don't want a lone hand. I want to build from the bottom until I'm bigger than
  I ever was before, and you'll be my first foundation stone, if you want to
  come in."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor stared down at his split of the plunder and drew in a breath.
  Then, without a word, he put away his loot in his clothes.</p>

  <p>"But," explained the outlaw, "I only want you if you feel that you're my
  man."</p>

  <p>"Why, Christian," said Gregor, "how can I help being your man? We're
  together if you say the word. I'm not such a fool as to turn you down. I know
  your record, man&mdash;part of it, anyway." Then he added: "But what makes
  you want me in? You don't know me."</p>

  <p>"I can read a man pretty well when I have a chance to look at him down the
  sights of a gun," answered Christian.</p>

  <p>He ran his long fingers through the flowing silk of his hair. As the cold
  of the evening began, he had wrapped a scarf around his throat, and he
  seemed, now, a very romantic figure, indeed. Gregor thought that he had never
  seen a more handsome or capable face.</p>

  <p>Christian went on: "There's another reason. No man could look so much like
  Jim Silver without having a brain in his head."</p>

  <p>"Has Silver a lot of brains?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian looked sharply at him, as though suspecting that he was being
  drawn on.</p>

  <p>"Silver's beaten me twice," he said simply. "That's enough brains for any
  man's nut to hold."</p>

  <p>"But what does he make out of beating you?" asked Gregor. "He travels
  around like a lone wolf that's been thrown out of the pack. He eats like a
  beggar and dresses like a tramp; and he's in as much danger, when he goes to
  a town, as anybody who's outside the law. What does he get out of life?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Barry Christian, "no matter what the danger, he goes where he
  pleases. He follows his own wish around the world. He rides the finest horse
  in the West, and tucked away, here and there, are rich men and poor men he
  can bank on if he needs them&mdash;fellows who would die for him if he gave
  them a chance and a call."</p>

  <p>"But he never gives 'em a chance," said Gregor. "He plays his hand all
  alone. I'd call it a fool's life."</p>

  <p>"Because you and I," said Christian, "don't like what's meat to him."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't even a woman he's fond of," said Gregor, "according to what
  people say."</p>

  <p>"The girl he's in love with," answered Christian, "is a lady with very
  bright eyes, old son&mdash;eyes so bright that they dazzle most of us more
  than diamonds. Danger is her name, and she's what Silver lives for."</p>

  <p>Gregor was silent, brooding on the matter.</p>

  <p>"Silver's done so much," said Christian, "that his name is known all over
  the West. And in the East, too, I suppose. Not many people have seen him,
  because of the way he lives, but he's a man whose name is strong enough to
  move mountains."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian was silent, smoking, thinking. Then he asked: "Gregor, are you
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Till the last card falls," said Gregor. "We'll shake on that."</p>

  <p>Their hands closed together. The eyes of Gregor blinked under the stare of
  Christian, and he knew, as he confronted the man, that that handshake was a
  turning point in his life. He had lived very much as he pleased before this.
  Now he felt that he had hitched himself to a comet that might snatch him to
  death in an instant. But there was the sort of manhood in Gregor that
  responded to the challenge and thrilled with it.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," said Christian. "You have the general build of Silver.
  You're not quite so much in the shoulders and not quite so lean in the hips.
  You don't look so much like a panther in good training. But there's a big
  resemblance. Your face isn't the same, aside from the scars, but the features
  are very much alike. Enough for me to make a mistake in the half light at the
  end of today, and that's one face in the world that should be familiar to me.
  If you can pass me in a half light, you can pass nearly everybody else in the
  full light of day. And out of that resemblance, you ought to be able to move
  mountains."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>"We'll need to touch you up a bit," said Christian. "For one thing, a
  couple of gray spots have to appear in your hair above the temples. For
  another thing, we'll need to make a few scars appear on your face. I can
  manage both things in a couple of hours so that it would take a microscope to
  tell that it's a fake. You need one other thing&mdash;you need a horse like
  Parade."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm beaten," said Gregor. "I've seen that big chunk of lightning,
  and I know there's no other like him."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," answered Christian. "I can put my hand on a thoroughbred
  chestnut stallion with the whole look of Parade about him. Not half an inch
  smaller, not fifty pounds lighter, and carries himself like a champion. He's
  on a ranch, not far from here&mdash;not twenty miles from here, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Four black stockings all around?" demanded Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Only one. But what are dyes for, Gregor? I tell you, I can get that horse
  for two or three thousand dollars, and with you on his back&mdash;after you
  and the horse have been touched up&mdash;you can ride into any town in the
  West and open it up like a nutshell. Along with you will be Barry Christian,
  looking like a tired old man, and between us we'll take the golden lining out
  of any place we name. What's the matter with Crow's Nest, with one of the
  biggest banks in a thousand miles of us?"</p>

  <p>The light had dawned in the eyes of Gregor. Now he threw up his hands with
  a whoop.</p>

  <p>"By jove, you're right, and the world's our oyster!" he shouted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; AT CROW'S NEST</h2>

  <p class="first">Not many days after that, a thrill went through Crow's Nest,
  from its smallest outlying shack to the new, big stone buildings of its main
  street, and then up the slopes on either side to the huge hotel on the one
  hand and to the hotel-casino-bathing establishment on the other, where the
  invalids from the North, South, and East came to be "cured." There was not
  very much to be said in favor of that spring water, but it had a taste of
  sulphur and a few other minerals in it, and a few quack doctors and a great
  deal of faith now and again worked marvelous cures. Where the faith is
  strong, the flesh can never be very weak.</p>

  <p>The excitement that ran like a flame through Crow's Nest and brought
  tradesmen away from their counters, and every boy and girl into the street,
  and men and women crowding into doors and windows, was all centered around
  two horsemen who came slowly up the main street.</p>

  <p>One of them was a fellow with long white hair and a face set off by
  beetling black brows and a short-cropped black mustache. A scar pulled one
  cheek and twisted his mouth a little toward a sneering smile, and yet it was
  a handsome face, after all, and the texture of the skin was surprisingly
  young for one wearing white hair. He was dressed in a battered old gray suit,
  and he rode a dusty mule, his body slumping forward in the saddle and his
  chin thrusting outward a little. When the mule trotted, his elbows flapped up
  and down, as a proof that he was not at all at home in the saddle.</p>

  <p>He was not the attraction, however. In fact, he won hardly a glance. What
  counted was the magnificent figure of the man on the prancing chestnut
  stallion, which sweated and danced all over the street and thereby enabled
  the rider to show off to better advantage the graces of his horsemanship.</p>

  <p>He was a big young man with a brown, handsome face that was streaked here
  and there with the silver of old scars. All around him poured the boys of the
  town. They swirled about him, shouting and leaping. Their more tardy
  companions, who had the news at a greater distance, were bringing dust clouds
  down the street as they rushed to join the procession. Some of the smaller
  boys reached for the stirrups of the rider. They seemed fearless even of the
  dancings of the horse.</p>

  <p>The older people in the community were hardly less enthusiastic. The men
  of the West seldom shed their dignity, but dignity was forgotten now. Here
  and there an enthusiast fired a gun into the air and gave a cowboy yell.</p>

  <p>An old man came hobbling on crutches to the gate of his front yard and
  waved his hat and shouted: "Jim Silver! Three cheers for Arizona Jim!"</p>

  <p>At this, the rider took off his hat and made a bow over his saddle, and
  there was more cheering, and a woman's shrill voice yipped:</p>

  <p>"It's Silver! I seen the gray spots, just like little horns! But there's
  no devil in Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>The whole street was washed by a wave of greater tumult, every moment, but
  all of the excitement was not exactly happy.</p>

  <p>Out of the hotel doorway ran a tall man with a sweeping black mustache. He
  carried a half-rolled blanket which he threw over the withers of a horse,
  and, mounting, with the tails of his long coat flapping behind him, he
  galloped hastily up the street, away from the disturbance. His big-brimmed
  gray Stetson blew off, but he did not pause to pick it up. He made tracks as
  fast as his horse could carry him.</p>

  <p>There were others who took horses here and there and seemed to be
  answering an inaudible summons that took them toward the tall timber.
  Gamblers, confidence men, thugs of various sorts had heard the cheering for
  Jim Silver, and to every one of them it seemed that a gun had been pointed at
  his head. For no man could tell on what errands Silver rode, except to be
  sure that the end of his trail would be the punishment of crime of one sort
  or another. It was best to take no chances with him. Chances taken with Jim
  Silver were too apt to end in fatalities.</p>

  <p>The impersonation given by the rider of the brilliant chestnut stallion
  was not perfect, however. As he went on, the white-haired man found a chance
  to swing his mule close to the chestnut and say, under his breath:</p>

  <p>"Don't stick out your chest like a fool! Remember Jim Silver's the most
  modest man in the world, Gregor!"</p>

  <p>"All right, Barry," said Gregor, and promptly brought the pace of his
  horse down a bit, and sat a shade less like a conqueror in the saddle.</p>

  <p>The pair of them drew up in front of the hotel, where the horse and mule
  were tethered.</p>

  <p>A man hurried up to them, saying: "Say, Jim Silver, you know that the big
  hotels are up on the hill. You go up there. This here ain't the best that
  Crow's Nest can offer you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, partner," Gregor answered, "but you take a big hotel and it
  always means a big bill. I ain't so flush with coin, d'you see? I guess this
  place is going to suit me pretty well."</p>

  <p>The proprietor of the hotel had managed to get out to the sidewalk all in
  a sweat, by this time. He was a fat little man, now flushed with excitement,
  and he grabbed the arm of Gregor and escorted him proudly into the lobby.</p>

  <p>He called out, as he came in: "Hey, Mr. Watson, if you don't mind moving,
  I'm going to give your corner room to Jim Silver and move you to the back.
  Mind?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Watson, standing up, tall and gangling, from his chair. He
  grew bright red with pleasure. "It ain't much that a gent ever has a chance
  to do for Jim Silver, and if I had ten rooms, I reckon that he could have
  them all."</p>

  <p>Gregor had turned with a grin toward Watson, when Christian kicked him
  sharply on the ankle, muttering:</p>

  <p>"Refuse, you fool!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Mr. Watson," said Gregor; "I can't take your room. About the best
  place for me is going to be a back room somewhere. I don't much care where.
  Quiet&mdash;and not too many windows&mdash;is what I'd rather have."</p>

  <p>"And that's a pity," said the proprietor. "Watson's room has three windows
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know, partner," said Gregor, breaking in, "that three guns can look
  in through three windows, and a gent can only look out of one window at a
  time."</p>

  <p>There was a big laugh at this. Gregor joined heartily in the mirth until
  Christian stepped on his toes. Then he bit his lip and subsided.</p>

  <p>They registered as James Silver and Thomas Bennett, then they were taken
  upstairs to pick out their room. A little back room with two cots in it was
  selected by Gregor after he had received a warning look from Christian. A
  moment later they were alone together, after the proprietor had assured them
  that there would be no charge to Jim Silver and company so long as they cared
  to stay, an offer which Gregor was again forced to refuse by a nudge from
  Christian.</p>

  <p>Now that they were alone, Christian locked the door and slumped into a
  chair. With a cold, bright eye he stared at his companion.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Barry?" asked Gregor. "You look as though I'd missed
  in the spelling bee."</p>

  <p>"No," said Christian slowly. "No, you haven't failed. It's all right.
  Almost anything would be all right so long as you're the fellow who's doing
  it. You could marry any girl in the town if you cared to smile at her twice.
  You could have any man's horse, dog, gun, or money for the asking. You could
  stay on forever in the best hotel and never have a bill sent in to you. You
  could sit in a corner the rest of your days and still be looked on as a
  public benefactor. And why? Because you're made up to look like Jim Silver,
  and because Jim Silver has used his guns on the side of the law."</p>

  <p>He left his chair and paced rapidly, softly, back and forth through the
  room. Plainly, he was smoking with subdued passion.</p>

  <p>"They'd die for him in a crowd," said Barry Christian. "They love the
  ground he walks on. But maybe they'll feel a little more sketchy about the
  wonders of Jim Silver before you and I are through with them. Maybe they'll
  understand that a name can cover more than one face. Man, how I hate them
  all! Every time they yelled for Silver it was just like a knife stuck into
  me."</p>

  <p>He leaned on the window sill and stared at the sweep of the great pine
  trees that climbed up the mountainside toward the glittering white of the
  health resort at the top of the slope.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Gregor, nodding. "It makes a gent sick to see people go
  nutty about some bum. Barry, I'm the king of this here town for a while.
  How'd I take the job?"</p>

  <p>Christian turned back on him. He controlled himself for an instant before
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I've told you that you did well enough," he said, "but you forget a great
  many of the things that I told you. Silver speaks grammatical English. You're
  apt to talk like a cross between an ignorant cowhand and a schoolteacher.
  Silver has the manner of a fellow who's almost afraid of a crowd; you act
  like an actor waiting for a curtain call. You keep your head in the air and
  look around with a silly grin. Silver looks at the floor and hardly smiles at
  all. When he looks a man in the eye, the man is apt to remember the hour and
  the day the rest of his life. Silver acts like a modest man.</p>

  <p>"You have to remember, all the time, that you're not yourself. You have to
  try to force yourself into a new frame of mind. You have to try to enlarge
  your heart and soul, and make yourself think that you're both brave and
  gentle. Silver is a man who wouldn't take a penny from the Bank of England;
  he'd fight a lion with his bare hands; and he'd die for any cause that seemed
  the right thing to him. Brother, you and I are not men of that type, but
  you'll have to try to expand to an extra size. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the other gloomily.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>Christian waved the fake Jim Silver aside and unlocked the door. The
  proprietor was standing there holding a note, wanting to know if everything
  was all right.</p>

  <p>"There's a gent downstairs that wrote this out. Wants to see Jim Silver,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Silver's all knocked out," said Christian loudly, after he had read the
  note. "Jim is lying down, resting. It's the first sleep he's had in a long
  while, and he needs it. Tell Taxi that he wants to see him, that he's wild to
  see him&mdash;tell him that from me, but say that I won't let anybody near
  Jim Silver till he's had at least a couple of hours' rest."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell him. I'll satisfy him. Is he a friend of Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>"He is. He's an old friend, I guess," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"Then he can have the whole house if he wants it," said the proprietor,
  and departed.</p>

  <p>Christian turned from the newly locked door with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Trouble right at the start," said Christian. "Everything's ruined, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"Why? Who's this Taxi, anyway? Is he someone who knows Silver?"</p>

  <p>"Knows him? Taxi knows him like a brother. Taxi is the crook who came out
  of the East with the soul of a wild Indian, the manners and the kindness of a
  wildcat, and a crooked reputation as long as your arm. Silver reformed him.
  Silver took him out of my hands, and then when I had Silver tied and as good
  as dead, Taxi cut him loose from me. I won't go into that yarn. I'll simply
  tell you that we've got our backs against the wall, flat! Taxi is only a
  split second slower than Silver on the draw and a shade quieter in the brain,
  but he's fast enough both ways to keep us both on the run. Gregor, you have a
  brain and a good pair of hands. So have I. Let's get ready to use everything
  we own!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; TAXI CALLS</h2>

  <p class="first">Christian got to the window in a stride and pulled down the
  shade. He picked up the hat he had thrown down and drew it well over his
  eyes, saying, in the meantime: "Kick off your boots, throw off your coat,
  pull off your trousers, pile into that bed."</p>

  <p>Gregor obeyed with speed, merely asking:</p>

  <p>"What's the main line of Taxi?"</p>

  <p>"He can fade through any lock that was ever made," answered Barry
  Christian. "He can read the mind of nearly any safe, but if he can't read its
  mind, he can crack it just as easily as he can crack his fingers."</p>

  <p>He caught up a pillow and wedged it in close beside the head of Gregor to
  cast a darker shadow over his face.</p>

  <p>"Tell Taxi," said Christian, "that you're in a big job. You want him, but
  not right away. Tell him to get out of town and wait till you send for
  him."</p>

  <p>"Will he do that?"</p>

  <p>"He'll do anything except jump off a cliff for you, so long as he thinks
  you're Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Christian added: "Don't look him in the eyes. He can see in the dark, like
  a cat. Keep looking down. Play you're dead tired. He can tell you by a touch.
  He's got eyes in his fingers. No, we can't risk him even shaking hands with
  you. Here&mdash;here are your gloves. Pull them on and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before he could get any further in his warnings and his preparations,
  there was a tap at the door. It was a light, quick rap of two soft beats, a
  pause, and a harder blow.</p>

  <p>The eye of Barry Christian flashed as he recognized a Signal that must
  have some meaning to the great Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>He went to the door and opened it. Before him stood a slender man of
  hardly a shade more than middle height, and dressed in a dapper blue suit,
  with a soft gray hat, and a pair of chamois gloves in his hand. His black
  hair was sleeked until it glistened. If he had been leaning on a walking
  stick, he would have served as a fashion advertisement out of a magazine. But
  Barry Christian had no illusions about the character under that dude
  exterior.</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and pressed the lean, nervous fingers of "Taxi."</p>

  <p>"Hello, Taxi," he said in a voice raised only a little above a whisper.
  "The old man has told me all about you. Silver's knocked out.
  Listen&mdash;don't stay long with him. He's all shot to pieces. Tired, I
  mean. Come on in."</p>

  <p>He backed away, and as he backed up, the slender fellow came with a
  soundless step through the doorway, and lifting his eyes, which were kept
  constantly lowered, he gave Christian one pale, bright gleam of inspection.
  Then he walked on toward the bed, smiling, and holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Jim, old boy!" he said.</p>

  <p>Gregor held out a hand that had a big riding glove on it.</p>

  <p>"Covered with rash," he explained, coughing as he spoke. "How are you,
  Taxi?"</p>

  <p>"I'm always on top of the world when I hear that you're anywhere near,"
  said Taxi, sitting down on the edge of the bed. "What's knocked you out?"</p>

  <p>Gregor pressed his head all the deeper among the pillows and let his arm
  fall at his side.</p>

  <p>"Been through a lot," he said, in a muffled, groaning voice, "and more
  trouble ahead."</p>

  <p>Taxi stood up.</p>

  <p>"I'm on deck," he offered.</p>

  <p>"Later," said Gregor, carefully maintaining that same groaning voice. "How
  many people saw you come?"</p>

  <p>"About three&mdash;outside the hotel. You know I don't walk the main
  streets when I can possibly help it, Jim."</p>

  <p>"Good," muttered Gregor. "If the rats know that you're with me, they may
  run for cover before I get my teeth in them."</p>

  <p>"What rats?" asked Taxi.</p>

  <p>"Tell you later. Taxi, will you help?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask. You know."</p>

  <p>"Good! Get out of town. Five or ten miles out, and stay put. Wait for me.
  I'll send you word when I want you. Tell me where you'll be."</p>

  <p>Taxi hesitated. Then he said: "There's a broken road that runs straight
  west of Crow's Nest. Never used. Out there, four or five miles, between a
  pair of steep hills that bear to the south, there's a little shack. I'll go
  there and wait, and nobody shall see me leave Crow's Nest, only the people in
  the hotel here. Can they be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody," said Gregor, shaking his head slowly. "Trust nobody."</p>

  <p>Taxi held out his hand. Gregor took it and let his arm fall wearily away
  again.</p>

  <p>"So long," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could stay here through the pinch," said Taxi, "but you always
  know best. I'll be out there waiting. I'll have fast horses with me and I'll
  be ready to jump."</p>

  <p>He turned to Christian.</p>

  <p>"I don't know you, but I've seen you somewhere," said Taxi.</p>

  <p>"I'm Thomas Bennett," said Christian, nodding. "I've been around, all
  right. Maybe you have seen me."</p>

  <p>Taxi went to the door, turned there as though he were about to speak once
  more, and then bent his pale, bright glance on Christian for another moment.
  After that, he left the room, and the door made no sound as he shut it behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" began Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>A frantic signal came from Barry Christian, cutting him short. Another
  signal made him relax once more in bed. Christian stood transfixed. Even in
  that dim light, Gregor could see that the face of his famous companion was
  shining with sweat.</p>

  <p>"That's one step behind us, and maybe the longest step of the lot," said
  Christian in a whisper.</p>

  <p>He went to the door and listened for a moment. Then he opened the door and
  looked into the hall. Turning back, he mopped his face and slumped down into
  a chair.</p>

  <p>"The wildcat!" said Christian. "Did you ever see such a pair of eyes? You
  can get up now."</p>

  <p>"Bored right into me through the shadows," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>He sat up and began to pull on his clothes. He, also, had need to wipe his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"You did it well," said Christian, after a moment of thought. "You
  couldn't have done it much better. But he suspected something."</p>

  <p>"He sure gave you a look, brother," agreed the other.</p>

  <p>"There was a ghost walking through his brain just then," answered
  Christian. "He couldn't put his finger on the right spot in his memory and he
  probably never will. He can't think of Barry Christian and Jim Silver being
  together in the same room. The two ideas won't fit. He's in some sort of
  doubt, but not enough to keep him from doing what you told him to do. That's
  the way that Silver would act&mdash;short sentences and let the other fellow
  do the guessing. You did it well, Duff, and you didn't slip on your English,
  either."</p>

  <p>"Aw, I can talk as good as anybody, when I get my mind fixed on it," said
  Duff Gregor. "Don't you worry about me, brother, when it comes to being
  slick. Slick enough to skate over the thinnest ice you ever seen."</p>

  <p>Christian considered him gravely for a moment and said nothing. He went
  back to the door, opened it, peered up and down the hall, and returned.</p>

  <p>"Walks like a cat too," he said. "He is a cat."</p>

  <p>"That's how he hit me," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"All the luck in the world," groaned Christian, "couldn't have hitched a
  more dangerous man to Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you buy him off? Give him a big split if he throws in with us?"
  asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian stared at him, but then he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand what you mean," he said. "I used to think the same thing, in
  the old days. I used to think that every man has his price, but that was
  before I met Jim Silver. Money's dirt to him. Money's dirt to this handsome
  young rat of a Taxi. I couldn't buy him if I offered him a diamond as big as
  my fist."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me," said Gregor, "as though we'd better drift out of this
  town pretty pronto."</p>

  <p>The big man nodded. "We have to work fast," he said. "There's that
  suspicion in the back of Taxi's brain, and he may come back to
  investigate."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said Gregor, "that he hears how I came prancing into town with
  the crowd cheering. That won't mate up very well with the way he found me
  stretched out here."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter," said Christian. "Taxi knows that Silver could bluff
  out the devil himself, when it comes to a showdown. Gregor, we have to work
  fast. But if things go well, before Jim Silver learns of his double here in
  Crow's Nest, we'll have a fortune in our pockets. And leaving town, we'll
  drop in at a little shack between a pair of hills four or five miles out of
  Crow's Nest, and there I'll settle an old score. There'll be one less man in
  the world when I get through with this job&mdash;and Taxi!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; WILBUR'S BANK</h2>

  <p class="first">The rest of that day was spent, presently, in making a
  little tour of the town, Gregor and Christian riding side by side. Gregor did
  very well. Perhaps fifty times they were stopped and asked to have a drink at
  the next saloon, but Gregor always said: "Thanks, but this is my dry time of
  day."</p>

  <p>The only advice that Christian gave him was: "Keep the voice down. Stop
  gririning, and hardly let yourself smile. Look kind&mdash;and tired. That's
  the nearest you can come to Jim Silver, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>They ate quickly, in a corner of the hotel dining room. It was an empty
  room when they sat down to eat. It was a crowded room before they had been
  there for five minutes. Duff Gregor, bathed in this light of another's glory,
  could hardly keep from thrusting out his chest and exulting. But his
  companion's quick, stern eye kept him in hand.</p>

  <p>A ten-year-old boy with the fore part of his face scrubbed till it was red
  and shining, while the dust of the day's playing still remained like a fine
  gray fur over the ears, came up and said:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Silver, the kids been and challenged me that I wouldn't dare to come
  in here and shake hands with you, so I come, anyway. My name's Joe
  Crosby."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor held out his hand with a grin. Christian kicked him violently
  beneath the table, and Gregor rose and controlled his grin to a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to meet you, Joe," he said. "Glad to meet any of your friends,
  too. What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Do for me?" crowed the boy. "Lemme sit one second in the saddle on
  Parade! By Jiminy, would you let me do that?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," said Gregor. "Tomorrow morning, wherever you see me and Parade
  together."</p>

  <p>The boy went off in a trance of joy, and Christian said:</p>

  <p>"That was all right, but wipe the grin off. Don't look as though you'd
  just been elected mayor of the town."</p>

  <p>Gregor said, in a voice that shuddered with ecstasy: "I could have more
  than that. I could be the mayor of the town and I could have the ground that
  it's built on, too. I'm Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Christian smiled at him with narrowed eyes. "Keep on thinking it," he
  said, "and Heaven help you if you bump into the real man again!"</p>

  <p>They turned in early that night. It was a hard job to get across the
  lobby, for the editor of the newspaper had come to interview the great
  visitor and get his first impressions of Crow's Nest. And the manager of the
  big hotel at the spring had come, also, to offer to Jim Silver the best suite
  in the building. Then there were prominent men from the lumber camps, from
  the mines, and from the ranches, who wanted to shake hands with Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>Gregor shook hands willingly enough, and he smiled on them all before he
  managed to get to the stairs. There Christian covered his retreat,
  saying:</p>

  <p>"The chief's all fagged out. He's going to turn in, boys. And you know how
  it is&mdash;he won't take something for nothing, and he doesn't like a lot of
  publicity. I'll just tell you all one thing. He likes Crow's Nest better than
  any town he was ever in in his life before. I don't know but what he'll want
  to settle down in it. He says that a man has to settle down sometime in his
  days."</p>

  <p>They gave the name of Jim Silver a good, hearty cheer, when they heard
  this announcement, and Christian went up to the room where Gregor was waiting
  and found him stretched out on the bed with his hands folded under his head,
  full of gloomy reflections.</p>

  <p>"Listen to 'em, Christian! Listen to 'em yell and cheer. All for Jim
  Silver. Doggone me if it don't make me sort of sick. What's Jim Silver done
  to get all that glory?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," said Christian coldly. "You could do the same thing. All
  you have to do is to shoot straighter than anybody else, ride a horse that
  can catch anything else on the range, and be willing to lay down your life
  for a square deal wherever you find the crooks collected. That's all you need
  to do, and after a few years, if you're not dead and have a lot of luck,
  you'll be just as famous as Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Gregor stared up at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what, Barry," he said, "it kind of makes a man think. It
  kind of makes a man wanta start all over again and try to do the right
  thing."</p>

  <p>"And get buried in the dust that the successful crooks raise as they ride
  past you? Is that what you want?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>Gregor shook his head and sighed again.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said. "Only a fellow can't help thinking!"</p>

  <p>"You do your thinking in your sleep," said Christian. "While we're on this
  lay, I intend to do your daytime thinking for you. Keep that straight in your
  head all the time."</p>

  <p>"I'll keep it straight," groaned Gregor.</p>

  <p>In the morning, five minutes after the doors of the Merchants &amp; Miners
  Bank had been opened, Duff Gregor, alias Jim Silver, walked into the
  institution.</p>

  <p>He went alone, but only because Barry Christian had been at work since
  shortly after daybreak, schooling him in deportment, watching him walk up and
  down, cursing him for the manner in which he was apt to break into grins and
  bad English.</p>

  <p>Gregor was already more than a little weary, but he was very determined,
  because he knew all about the greatness of the stakes that he was playing
  for.</p>

  <p>The Merchants &amp; Miners Bank had been reared from a weak infancy to
  great strength by the skill and the business integrity of a real financier,
  Henry Wilbur. He had come out to this country and settled in it because he
  liked it. And the reason he liked it had nothing to do with the sunsets
  behind towering mountains, but a great deal to do with the splendid forests
  of pine and spruce that covered the sides of the slopes. He did not wax
  enthusiastic about the many-colored cliffs of granite and porphyry, but he
  had a keen eye for the precious metals that could be found veining them here
  and there. He never brooded dreamily over the pleasant green meadows, but he
  knew to a half acre how much land was required to keep a steer in good flesh
  through any sort of a season.</p>

  <p>Henry Wilbur knew a great deal about three important industries, but he
  lacked the intimate practical knowledge which would enable him to step
  directly into any one of the three fields. He did the next best thing. He
  picked out men who did have the practical knowledge and training and he
  backed them. That was how he made money. He was the partner, ready at hand,
  of any man with brains and industry.</p>

  <p>Many a story was told of fellows who had walked into the office of Henry
  Wilbur without a cent in their pockets and nothing but ideas in their heads,
  and of how they had came out again with enough gold to break the back of a
  mule. Sometimes Wilbur put a bet on the wrong man. In those cases, he
  swallowed his losses with a smile. His faith in human nature could never be
  destroyed, and since he had both faith and judgment, he won two times out of
  three, which is enough to make a fortune keep mounting.</p>

  <p>He succeeded, in short, because he knew men and because men knew him. They
  knew that he was loyal, generous, and faithful. They opened their hearts to
  Henry Wilbur, and he knew how to bolster weak places and reenforce strong
  points. His bank was like a great heart which kept money, life, hope, and
  energy constantly in circulation through those mountains. One thing he had
  never touched was the exploitation of the mineral springs of Crow's Nest. He
  would have nothing to do with them because he was not assured that there was
  something more in the cure than faith and advertising. His interests were all
  based on the soil and its products, vegetable or mineral.</p>

  <p>Being a modest man, he had kept the physical surroundings of his bank
  modest, also. It was simply a little squat house built of natural stone such
  as cropped out in every vacant lot in Crow's Nest. The stone that had been
  cleared, years ago, to give a place for the building was what had been used
  to erect its walls. That was typical of the sensible thrift of Henry Wilbur.
  He said, when other business men of the growing town urged him to put up a
  building more in proportion to the size of his success:</p>

  <p>"All a man needs is good light to see by, good air to breathe, and space
  enough to sit and think. I have all these things in this place, and so have
  the men who work with me. Why should I make a change?"</p>

  <p>So he sat in the same office which had been his for twenty years, and
  behind the very same desk. That desk had begun to spring in the knees, and,
  therefore, he had remedied the defect by having a long iron rod run through
  it from side to side. When the nut was screwed up tight on the strong
  threads, the desk pulled its feet in and was as strong as ever.</p>

  <p>It was the sign, "Henry Wilbur, Private Office," that caught the eye of
  Duff Gregor, as he walked into the bank that morning.</p>

  <p>The janitor-doorman, with his eyes popping out from his head, came
  hurrying to meet Gregor. Behind their clouded windows or in their cages of
  bronze-gilt steel, the clerks and tellers stood up and gaped at the great
  man.</p>

  <p>Gregor took off his hat and looked slowly around him.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said. "This is what a bank is like, eh? It's about the
  first time I ever was in one."</p>

  <p>He had composed that speech on the way to the bank, because Barry
  Christian, before sending him off alone, had said:</p>

  <p>"Don't try to be smart. Jim Silver is so simple that he'd be willing to
  ask questions of a five-year-old child. There's no side to him, and when he
  hears a compliment, you can see that it hurts."</p>

  <p>The janitor said: "It's a bank, all right. I'll show you over the place,
  Mr. Silver. Wait just a minute while I get my keys and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you trouble yourself," said Gregor. "The fact is that I'd like to
  speak a word to Mr. Henry Wilbur, if he's not too mighty busy."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wilbur won't be too busy to see you," said the janitor heartily. "I
  guess there's nobody on this side of the Mississippi that would be too busy
  to see you. As soon as Mr. Wilbur comes in, he'll&mdash;Hi! Here he comes now
  with his daughter."</p>

  <p>Gregor saw a big man, whose shoulders sloped a bit from too much sitting
  at a desk, a big man leaning with the weight of his body, a large, flushed
  face, with dark eyebrows that gave accent to the noble largeness of the
  forehead. His eyes were grave, his mouth was smiling, and he had the air of
  one who has faced trouble many times and never with a subdued spirit.</p>

  <p>The girl beside him was like her father, but with all the grossness of
  flesh and the hardness of experience removed. She was slender, straight; she
  had the direct eye that goes with a simple mind, and that clear and unstained
  brightness which cannot be after life has been tasted. She was not beautiful.
  She was something more. Even Gregor could realize that. He wondered what the
  name of Jim Silver would do to her.</p>

  <p>The janitor-doorman was making straight for Henry Wilbur, exclaiming as he
  came up to him:</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver is here, Mr. Wilbur. He wants to see you. Here's Mr. Wilbur,
  Jim Silver!" Then he added: "Miss Ruth Wilbur too."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor took off his hat so that he could show both courtesy and those
  two spots of gray hair which Christian had, with such care, arranged about
  his temple. The banker took off his hat, also. He stood up straight. There
  was an actual reverence in his voice, as he said:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Silver, this is a proud and happy moment!"</p>

  <p>Even if his glory was vicarious, it was the great instant in the life of
  Duff Gregor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE VALUE OF A NAME</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl was blushing and smiling and yet looking Gregor
  straight in the eye in a confidential sort of way, as though she were not in
  the least ashamed of showing her admiration. She took his hand and gave it a
  good hard grip also. She said:</p>

  <p>"How happy, happy I am to see you, Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Well, that is the way that little children walk up to a big Newfoundland,
  a picture-book dog, and hang onto its shaggy sides, and throttle it with the
  grip of their arms, and laugh fearlessly because they know that no harm will
  come to them. Their trust is perfect. So was the trust which people gave to
  the name of Jim Silver. And the wretched heart of Duff Gregor suddenly shrank
  in him and distilled a poison of envy and malice.</p>

  <p>He did not have to struggle to keep from grinning; he had to struggle to
  smile at all. He told Mr. Wilbur that he would like to talk with him for a
  few moments, and Wilbur took him instantly by the arm toward his private
  office. The girl was turning to go home. Over her shoulder she was calling
  out that there was a batch of trout for lunch, if Jim Silver cared to come to
  the house and eat with them.</p>

  <p>Gregor could only smile and shake his head, then he was seated with Wilbur
  in the sanctum. The banker pulled open a drawer and got out a box of cigars.
  No, Gregor did not smoke them. He rolled a cigarette of fine tobacco, because
  that was the only thing that the real Jim Silver was known to smoke.</p>

  <p>Wilbur was saying: "Every honest man feels safer when you're near by,
  Silver. I'm very glad you're here, but I'm also a little worried because I
  know you generally are on the trail of some rascal or other. I hope it's no
  big trouble that's brought you to Crow's Nest?"</p>

  <p>"The biggest trouble in the world," said Gregor. "Mr. Wilbur, I'm trying
  to settle down."</p>

  <p>He paused. Wilbur, listening, with his head canted to one side, nodded a
  little. He lighted a cigar. As he puffed, he never moved his respectfully
  attentive eyes from the face of his guest. He waited for the idea to be
  developed.</p>

  <p>Gregor went through with the speech which Christian had composed and which
  he had carefully rehearsed.</p>

  <p>"I've had a good deal of the open trail, and a fellow can get tired."</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows you've covered enough trail," said Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"After all, I'm getting no younger, and in the winter the old wounds ache.
  I have a few wounds, Mr. Wilbur, and they touch me up when a norther
  blows."</p>

  <p>"If you had a thousand for every scar, you'd be a rich man, Silver. I know
  that," he said.</p>

  <p>Gregor waved the number of his scars aside. He said: "I've decided that
  I'll stop hunting for trouble and wait for trouble to hunt me, and that's why
  I came here. I'd heard a good deal about Crow's Nest. It looks like the right
  sort of a place for me. There's plenty of clean air, and when I carne to the
  town, I wondered what sort of a job I could find, because I'm almost
  broke."</p>

  <p>Wilbur nodded and answered: "I know. You've made half a dozen fortunes and
  always you've thrown them away again. I understand that, Silver. Every hand
  that's held out to you, you fill. Now do you mean that you want me to find
  you a job?"</p>

  <p>"That's the idea," said Gregor. "I thought you could give me a steer."</p>

  <p>"You could have anything you want," said the banker. "Any rancher would be
  glad to have you as a foreman, not because you know anything about raising
  cattle, but because the best cowpunchers on the range would come swarming to
  work under you. Any miner would be glad to have you as a foreman of his mine,
  or a superintendent, for the same reason. There will probably be no labor
  troubles wherever you choose to take charge. And as a matter of fact, if you
  care to lead a lazy life, you could be the lightning rod in this bank."</p>

  <p>"I could be what?" asked Gregor, pretending that he had not
  understood.</p>

  <p>"I mean to say," said the other, "that you could be our watchman&mdash;or
  armed secretary, or sergeant-at-arms, or any other title that you choose to
  give it. And the minute that it's known that you are here in charge, every
  man in the mountains will rush to get his money deposited in my bank. There
  are plenty of old-timers with fortunes tucked away in secret places because
  they feel that there's no safe in the world that can't be cracked. But
  there's not a one of them who doesn't feel that Jim Silver can be trusted
  much further than any amount of armor plate."</p>

  <p>The idea began to grow in the mind of the banker. He got up and took a
  step or two up and down the room, waving his cigar.</p>

  <p>"It would be one of the best things that ever happened to this bank, Jim
  Silver, if we could attach you. Your name would attract a whole crowd of
  depositors. Many another bank will suffer because you've chosen to appear in
  Crow's Nest, if you care to work for me. But how do you feel about it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Gregor, staring down at the floor to conceal his
  exultation, for this was the very manner in which Christian had said that the
  fish would rise to the bait. "I've never thought of sitting still, with
  nothing on my mind but hair, as you might say. It would seem a little
  strange, Mr. Wilbur."</p>

  <p>"It would be more than sitting still," declared the banker. "Every one of
  our new depositors would want to meet you. Every one of them would feel a lot
  safer about his money after knowing that he had shaken hands with the real
  Jim Silver. Then, you would want to keep an eye on people who might walk into
  the bank and plan a holdup. Those things happen, and with your experience,
  you know a great number of the crooks throughout the West. No, you'd be busy
  enough, Jim Silver. You'd be a vast asset to us. Yes, I can foresee that
  you'd bring in added deposits of hundreds of thousands in a year. By thunder,
  I might change the name of the place and call it the Jim Silver Bank. Your
  name would stand for bedrock and Gibraltar with every man on the range!"</p>

  <p>His excitement grew.</p>

  <p>"I'll be able to pay you a hundred a week just as a starter, Mr. Silver,
  and more than that as soon as my hopes materialize."</p>

  <p>The heart of Duff Gregor leaped, but he remembered the careful
  instructions of Barry Christian, which had been repeated over and over again.
  Gregor had a feeling that if he went counter to those instructions, Barry
  Christian would simply kill him out of hand.</p>

  <p>So he answered now, instead of swallowing the bait: "If I'm going to be a
  watchman, I'll only want a watchman's salary. If you'll give me twelve or
  fifteen dollars a week, that will be enough. If you could put on my old
  friend, Thomas Bennett, as night watchman, say, at the same figure, I
  wouldn't ask any more. It's a good thing to have a friend&mdash;an old friend
  in a new town, you know."</p>

  <p>"Twelve or fifteen a week!" exclaimed Wilbur. "Why, of course, we'll take
  on your man. We'll take on anybody you want, but I'd be ashamed to pay Jim
  Silver, or even a friend of his, as little as that."</p>

  <p>Gregor shook his head. "I've got only two eyes; I'm not more honest than a
  lot of other watchmen, and I can't be worth more pay. Besides, all I need is
  enough food to eat, and I like my chuck plain. And a couple of beers on
  Saturday night are enough for me. It isn't a big salary that I'm looking for.
  It's simply a chance to be quiet, Mr. Wilbur."</p>

  <p>"You'll have that chance, then," said the banker. He was flushed with
  excitement. "I'm going to spread the news as fast as hard riders can take it
  through the mountains," he said. "Wait here a moment, Mr. Silver. I'll be
  back. I've got to have the messages started at once, because there is going
  to be a golden tide started toward my bank, before the world is a day
  older."</p>

  <p>He hurried out and was gone for a few moments. When he came back, he was
  fairly laughing with happiness.</p>

  <p>"A dozen men will be hitting the trail with their mustangs inside an
  hour," he said, "and every place on the range will have the news inside of a
  week. After that, the golden flood begins. And you tell me that I can only
  give you the wages of an ordinary cowpuncher? It's not fair, Silver!"</p>

  <p>"It's fair to me," said Gregor. "Enough is as good as a bale of hay. Let
  it go at that."</p>

  <p>"We can argue it over later on," answered Wilbur. "Now we'll look over the
  bank."</p>

  <p>He took out a bunch of keys and led the way straight to the great safe. It
  was the one modern feature of the bank, and Gregor looked it over with
  understanding and rather despairing eyes. This was certainly no job for a
  "can opener." This was a case where "soup" would have to be used.</p>

  <p>He photographed that safe with a careful eye and then followed the
  president of the bank down into the cellar storage rooms, and up again
  through the main floor, and into the attic.</p>

  <p>Wilbur said: "Your job begins this minute, if you want it to."</p>

  <p>"I'd better find a shack," said Gregor. "The best thing for me would be to
  find a shack where Bennett and I can live; we'll move out of the hotel and
  get into quarters where we can cook for ourselves. Thank you, Mr. Wilbur. I
  hope I can be half as useful as you think."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; A CHANCE MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">Far north of Crow's Nest, the real Jim Silver came through
  the mottled and ghostly pallor of a birch wood and stopped at the edge of a
  stream. It was a silent little creek that seemed to steal along with a finger
  pressed against its lips. The sun streaked down through the trees and glinted
  like metal on the thousand upturned edges of the curling bark. That bark was
  thin as paper. It had a yellow tint in its white, and by that "Arizona Jim"
  knew it to be the yellow birch. He picked off a leaf. The stem was fuzzy, the
  leaf coarser and more serrated of edge than the black birch.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver looked up from the water and the trunks of the trees to the
  lift of the thin branches that seemed to him to be bursting upward and
  outward, like green fountains. Life rushed up from the ground through those
  curving lines that never returned to the earth again. Happiness rushed up
  through the heart of Jim Silver, also.</p>

  <p>He was most of his time among the grays of the desert, the blues and
  browns of the great mountains, or the perpetual twilight of pine and spruce
  forests. As he stood in this delicate woodland, he wondered why he did not
  give more of his life to such surroundings. It was not silent, really.
  Whenever the wind stirred, it seemed as though an invisible river were
  streaming across the heavens. And even when the wind did not move, there was
  always a stealthy approaching noise, though at first this was not audible to
  ears more attuned to the sounds of the deserts and the iron mountains.</p>

  <p>The stallion stood as quietly as his master. He would have liked to try
  the taste of some of the tender shoots of the saplings, but the whole air of
  Jim Silver was one of caution, and, therefore, the horse stood on guard with
  shining eyes. It was he that gave warning of a possible danger by tossing his
  head and looking fixedly up the stream. A moment later a canoe slid around
  the sharp angle of the bend. Silver could hear the gurgling of the water as
  the paddle blade was driven into it with a short, powerful side stroke, to
  straighten out the little bark canoe.</p>

  <p>He wondered if the bearded man in the canoe would see him. He stood still,
  without a word. The paddler worked with leisurely strokes. He seemed to have
  time for nothing except watching the intricacies of the current, which was
  full of shiftings in spite of its soundless flow, and yet when he was at a
  little distance, he called out suddenly, and backed water.</p>

  <p>He grounded the canoe and sprang out. No wonder he had seen the man on the
  bank, for it seemed to Silver that he had never seen brighter, smaller eyes,
  more like those of a bird. They were buried deeply in the hairy face. He came
  striding up the bank with his hand out, a big, burly fellow, laughing with
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Jim Silver!" he cried. "You taking a vacation out of Crow's Nest?
  Don't go and tell me that you been and given up your job down there, or I'll
  tell 'em to fetch my money back to my old bank!"</p>

  <p>Silver looked at him with a quiet concern as he shook hands.</p>

  <p>"I take a vacation once in a while," he said.</p>

  <p>"And you're goin' back, eh?" asked the stranger. "When I heard that Jim
  Silver had taken a job in the Merchants &amp; Miners Bank that old Henry
  Wilbur runs, I decided that that was the place for my coin. I ain't got much,
  but every thousand looks as big as a whale to a fellow like me. And I says to
  myself, where would my money rest as safe as in a bank that Jim Silver is
  around? The minute I heard the news, I made the change&mdash;and then,
  doggone my spots, I find you up here lookin' at the runnin' of the creek a
  whole day's ride from Crow's Nest. Yeah, a whole day, even for Parade!"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand toward the muzzle of the stallion, which laid back
  threatening ears.</p>

  <p>The fellow laughed. "I clean forgot that Parade is likely to be poison to
  strangers. What we know about Jim Silver makes a gent feel that even his guns
  and hosses can't do nothin' except what's right!"</p>

  <p>He was full of talk, bubbling with it, yet Jim Silver did not know his
  name when he stepped again into the canoe and sped it down the stream with
  long, powerful strokes of the paddle. A twist of the bank took him out of
  sight, and yet Silver remained there staring at the empty corner of the creek
  and seeing his own thoughts.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to grow more and more discontented with certain features
  of his life. He had tried for years to avoid the world, but the world was
  continually thrusting itself upon him. It was typical that in the rush and
  pause of existence among these trees he should be rudely given a message that
  made him turn back on his trail and speed toward Crow's Nest.</p>

  <p>He had never been in that town; he never had wanted to be in such a
  crowded place if he could avoid it; but when he learned that "Jim Silver" was
  working there for a bank, he was alarmed. Nobody could be wearing his name by
  chance; he could be sure that there was only one "Jim Silver" for everyone on
  the range. Some rascal, then, had tried to assume his identity.</p>

  <p>He wondered why he had not explained to this unknown man that he had never
  worked in Crow's Nest, but his whole nature was against talk and in favor of
  action.</p>

  <p>Whatever scheme the fellow in Crow's Nest might have in mind, a vague
  alarm from a distance would merely serve to frighten him away. And, since the
  real Jim Silver was only a day from the town, it would be better for him to
  turn up on the spot and confront the crook face to face.</p>

  <p>It was the sort of danger which he had never conceived. He had been in
  peril of his life more times than he could count, but hitherto no one had
  endangered his good name. He turned out of that wood, pulled up the cinches a
  little tighter, and mounted Parade. The stallion was in perfect trim and
  ready for a good run. He would have need of all his endurance before his
  master was through with him this day. The night would pour over the
  mountains, it would be early the next morning before Jim Silver could
  possibly reach Crow's Nest.</p>

  <p>He looked toward the west and saw that the falling sun already was
  gathering about it a bright halo of the horizon mist. Then he picked up his
  course, named to his mind's eye the landmarks which he must follow by day and
  night, and loosed the reins of Parade.</p>

  <p>It was only a little later than this moment that big Duff Gregor, walking
  with Ruth Wilbur in the garden behind her father's house, entirely lost
  control of himself and "went wrong."</p>

  <p>There were two troubles in the situation. One was that Duff Gregor was
  convinced that he had a "way with women"; the other trouble was that the girl
  had treated him like a brother. Then the garden was more of a forest than its
  name indicated, and as the sun slanted to the west and the rose and gold of
  it washed among the trees, Gregor was carried off his feet and away by a
  stream of romance.</p>

  <p>Ruth had run her hand through the crook of his arm, and side by side they
  wandered up and down, the girl talking and laughing, and the man growing more
  and more dizzy.</p>

  <p>For one thing, he was glad to be away from the continual surveillance of
  Barry Christian. For Barry had made him swear to confine himself to the
  little shack which they had rented on a back alley of the town. Unless Gregor
  were actually in the bank, he had given his word that he would be in the
  small house. This day he had broken his promise&mdash;and he was unspeakably
  glad of it.</p>

  <p>He began to see other possibilities of the future. If he were to
  double-cross Barry Christian, he would be in danger from that outlaw's guns;
  but, on the other hand, if he married Ruth Wilbur, he would be on the direct
  road toward a fortune.</p>

  <p>That was as far as he thought out the problem. He was not doing much
  thinking, just then. Suddenly, turning on the girl, he stammered out a few
  confused words and grabbed her in his arms and kissed her, not taking time to
  note the sudden revulsion of feeling in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She made no outcry. She simply stood like a stone. And then came what
  seemed the most hateful voice in the world, saying:</p>

  <p>"Jim! Are you crazy?"</p>

  <p>It was Barry Christian, suddenly appearing from among the trees by a small
  side path.</p>

  <p>Gregor stepped back from the girl far enough to get a bit of perspective
  in the mind as well as the eye, and he saw that he had made something more
  than a fool of himself. She had a handkerchief pressed against her mouth, and
  she was looking at him as though he were a monster out of a strange
  world.</p>

  <p>He tried to say something more, but as Christian came up the path, the
  courage and the wits of Gregor both deserted him. He turned and bolted
  through the brush and got away from those fixed and nightmare eyes of fear.
  No, he decided that it was not fear so much as disgust.</p>

  <p>That was what kept the cold shudders going up and down his back. She was
  more horrified than angered or frightened. He would not have minded anger or
  fear, he thought.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Barry Christian, coming up the path, had seen how the
  girl bowed her head and stared down at the ground. She was obviously trying
  to put together her former ideas of "Jim Silver" and the reality as she had
  found it.</p>

  <p>Christian took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"Miss Wilbur," he said, "doggone me if it ain't the meanest moment in my
  life. Not this here moment, but having seen Jim Silver act like that. I wanta
  say something to you, and I hope you believe it."</p>

  <p>She raised her head, but still she seemed to be seeing her own ideas more
  than the face of Christian.</p>

  <p>"I simply don't believe it," she said. "I don't believe that it was Jim
  Silver."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Christian, thoroughly knocked off balance. "You don't
  believe that it's really Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>"He's not the man I've been hearing about for all these years," said the
  girl. "The man I've heard about couldn't act like that."</p>

  <p>"It's because he don't know how to deal with a girl," said Christian. "You
  know how it is. He ain't the sort that ever has to do with women. He never
  pays no attention to them. I might 'a' knowed the other day that he was clean
  out of his head about you, because he talked for hours. He talked, and he
  said that he'd never seen anybody like you. He talked like you were an angel
  out of heaven. He's out of his head about you, that's what the matter is.
  Ma'am, you'd do him a pile of harm if you talk about this."</p>

  <p>"Harm him?" she said, throwing up her head in a fine way. "I'd rather cut
  off my hand. Perhaps you're right, and it's simply that he doesn't
  understand. But to turn into a brute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She checked herself sharply and added: "It would be a pitiful sort of a
  world if Jim Silver couldn't be forgiven. He's done enough glorious things
  for a few bad ones to be forgotten. Will you tell him that I won't speak a
  single word about this to my father, or to anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"Ma'am," said Barry Christian, really moved, "I suppose that I should 'a'
  sort of expected this kind of talk from the daughter of a man like Henry
  Wilbur. It'd be the ruin of Silver if people got an idea that he was out of
  his head about women. Ma'am, he's the sort of a man that's never done wrong,
  and if once folks find out that he ain't perfect, they'll never forgive
  themselves for ever praising him."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Tell him that I won't talk," she said. "It's nothing so
  dreadful&mdash;the kissing of a girl." Her lip curled. "I hope that I'll
  never have to see his face again; if I do I'll manage to endure it. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>"I want to say," said Christian, "that poor Jim Silver&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She lifted a hand.</p>

  <p>"You can't say a thing about Jim Silver that I haven't thought all by
  myself," she told him. "I've lain awake at night and wondered how there could
  be such a man in the world. Well&mdash;now I'm a little sick and I don't want
  to think about him any more. Good evening, Mr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>That was the best that Barry Christian could do, and he left the banker's
  place and went straight across Crow's Nest to the shack. There was still a
  little time before he went on duty, and after the end of his partner's
  daytime rgime.</p>

  <p>The shack stood on the edge of a gully that split across the face of the
  mountain town. Sometimes, after a rain, there was a great racket of water
  dashing among the big stones in the bottom of the ravine, but as a rule the
  gulch was empty, and the little shack stood on the verge of its crumbling
  slope. It was not worth moving, and it was, after almost any heavy storm, apt
  to slide down to ruin in the bottom of the canyon.</p>

  <p>In the house Christian found Duff Gregor walking up and down with long
  strides. The sun was resting its rim on the edge of the world and pouring
  flame across the mountains, and Barry Christian wished that real fire might
  rush out on Gregor and consume him. But he said nothing. He simply stood in
  the doorway and watched the promenade of Gregor, until the latter whirled
  about.</p>

  <p>"All right! Go ahead and shout it out!" said Gregor. "Tell me I'm a
  fool."</p>

  <p>Christian said nothing.</p>

  <p>"How could I know that she was that way?" demanded Gregor. "I can't
  understand a girl like that. Had her arm in mine. She put her arm in mine.
  Laughin' like a fool, she was, most of the time. Laughin', and turnin' her
  eyes up to mine and shinin' them at me. How could I tell what she was like? A
  girl that acts like that&mdash;that's different!"</p>

  <p>Still Christian was silent, until Gregor broke down and begged:</p>

  <p>"What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"After you turned around and ran like a kicked dog?" said Christian. "Why,
  I talked to her and made a good many excuses. I said that you weren't used to
  women. I said a good many other things. Finally, she told me that you were
  just a brute."</p>

  <p>"Brute?" shouted Gregor, rising to his toes with wrath.</p>

  <p>"Just a low brute," said Christian, "not worthy of a thought."</p>

  <p>"She said that about Jim Silver, did she?" roared Gregor. "After the
  things that I've done for the world and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What have you done for the world, Gregor?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>Gregor cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I got sort of tangled up just then," he admitted. "I mean, for all she
  knows, I'm Jim Silver, and yet she'd throw me out of the door like that. Just
  for kissing her, eh? That shows what she's made of. That shows she ain't no
  good. I wouldn't have a gross of her for a gift. She ain't worth
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"I won't shut up," cried Gregor. "I'm goin' to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up or I'll shut you up," said Christian. "I've half a mind to cut
  the heart out of you, and partly because you have the crust to talk like that
  about Ruth Wilbur. Why, Gregor, it soils the mind of a girl like that to so
  much as think down to you. But as a matter of fact, she's not going to say a
  word to her father&mdash;and so you've still got the job. Be thankful for
  that!"</p>

  <p>"She told you she wouldn't speak to him?" exclaimed Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Gregor fell into a chair and mopped his face.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was the finish of everything!" he gasped at last. "I thought
  the big chance was queered. I thought it was the end."</p>

  <p>"It is the end," answered the other.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"This is the night, Duff."</p>

  <p>"You mean for crackin' the safe?"</p>

  <p>"This is the night."</p>

  <p>Gregor came bounding to his feet again.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like a fool, Barry!" he argued. "Every day they're bringin' in
  money by the carload. The little one-horse banks all through the mountains
  are being cleaned out, and the depositors are sendin' us their money. They
  must be gettin' in thousands of dollars every day over there in Wilbur's
  bank. The old man smiles like a risin' sun every day. Barry, if we make our
  clean-up and jump now, we're missin' a lot of cream."</p>

  <p>Christian nodded. "I intended to wait for another week," he declared, "in
  the hope that we would be safe that long&mdash;before Jim Silver hears that
  there's an alias of his down here in Crow's Nest. But after you've made this
  break, I'm on edge to get the job finished and over with."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Gregor. "As long as she'll keep her mouth shut, why shouldn't
  we wait? Another week might bring in a lot more cash into that little bank.
  It's bulgin' now. Barry, it's goin' to be sweet pickin's! The sweetest
  pickin's you ever knew, and I'm not foolin'!"</p>

  <p>He threw up his hands. He was trembling like flame with his
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"We can quit the game. I'm goin' to Europe and settle down and have a
  rest. I'm goin' to taste some life!" cried Duff Gregor. "And every day we
  wait before we pull the job, the better for us. Besides, we ain't got the
  combination, yet."</p>

  <p>He waited, panting, resting much on the last remark he had made.</p>

  <p>"I think I have that combination," said Christian. "The other day I found
  a chance to be alone with that safe and I took off the dial knob of the lock
  and put a bit of steel wire&mdash;no use explaining the details&mdash;on the
  inside surface of the dial. I replaced the knob, and I think that bit of wire
  may be able to tell me the right combination."</p>

  <p>"You're a fox!" exclaimed Gregor in great admiration. Then he added: "But
  it's all the more reason why we ought to wait till the last
  minute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something in the face of Christian stopped him, and he asked: "What's the
  matter, Barry? You look gray as a stone."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is," answered Christian. "In a woman you'd call it
  premonition, or instinct. I don't know what it is in me, but it's a thing
  that tells me we haven't much time to spare. Tonight's the night. You start
  cooking the dynamite now and make the soup."</p>

  <p>"Soup?" said Gregor nervously. "But what's the matter? I thought you said
  that you would be able to read the combination?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I will. If we had time to leave the wire inside the lock for
  another day, I'm sure I could. But if I fail, we'll have to try to blow the
  safe."</p>

  <p>The other closed his eyes and groaned.</p>

  <p>Christian came up to him and took him by the lapels of his coat.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me!" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm listenin'," groaned Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>"If you lose your nerve like a dog, I'll have one bit of satisfaction
  before I leave this town. I'll cut your throat for you, Gregor!"</p>

  <p>Gregor, staring at him, knew there was nothing that Barry Christian could
  have said that he could have meant more thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"You think I'd welsh on you?" said Gregor. "Wait till the pinch comes
  before you start yowlin' about me. Do your own job as well as I do mine, and
  we'll walk off with the inside linin' of that safe, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Christian. "Be a man. That's all I ask of you. Get the
  soup ready and work up some of that yellow laundry soap till it's the right
  consistency for the running of a mold. You know how to do that?"</p>

  <p>"I know," Gregor nodded. "Only&mdash;it's bad business in a place like
  this. In a business district in a big town, where everybody's asleep in the
  middle of the night, it's not so bad. But the noise of shooting a safe will
  get a hundred people on horseback, in a place like this!"</p>

  <p>Christian turned in the doorway, regarded his companion silently for a
  moment, and then, without another word, walked off in the direction of the
  bank, for it was time for him to take up his duties as night watchman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>X. &mdash; GREGOR'S PREPARATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">There is a certain amount of care necessary when dynamite is
  converted into "soup," because when the sediment has settled to the bottom of
  the pot, there remains a rather muddy liquid which can be strained off, and
  this is almost pure nitroglycerin. And nitroglycerin has to be handled with
  awe, because if it is bottled up under too tight a stopper, it is likely to
  oppress itself with its own evaporation, and explode. And if it grows too
  cold, it is likely to explode, also. Of course, sudden jerks and jars are apt
  to be fatal too. And when Duff Gregor had finished making the soup, he was in
  a sweat.</p>

  <p>For one thing, he had locked the doors of the shack, and the night was
  warmer than usual. But he could not permit his usual audience of admiring
  small boys and youths of the town to assemble and watch this extraordinary
  cookery of his. When they came, and knocked and called to him, he simply had
  to tell them that he was out of sorts. They went off reluctantly and left him
  to his work.</p>

  <p>He got the laundry soap prepared also, mashing it up and moistening it
  just enough to give it the consistency of a very strong, tough, and sticky
  mortar. He had a length of fine wire, too, which could be used in running the
  mold just over the meager crack which outlined the door of the safe.</p>

  <p>When he had finished these preparations, he paused in some doubt. He was
  so accustomed to working according to the direct orders of Christian that he
  was hardly prepared to use his own initiative. But he knew that the
  contemptuous silence of Christian's departure had been a direct challenge to
  him and his efficiency. Therefore, he remembered that they must have their
  horses ready. They had the chestnut stallion, of course. Every evening he had
  been in the habit of riding the frisky horse out for exercise, taking ways
  where he would not be observed, because it was certain that he could not
  control the chestnut in an emergency in the same way that the real Parade was
  handled by Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>He got the stallion ready and he also saddled the plain-looking mare which
  Christian had provided for himself. This animal had prominent hip bones,
  carried its head low, and had a very ugly head. But the mare was in reality a
  good piece of running machinery and in a pinch would probably give as good an
  account of itself as the more showy stallion.</p>

  <p>Then Gregor cleaned a pair of Winchester rifles and prepared in two
  saddlebags sufficient provisions to keep a man alive for a week if he were
  careful in his diet. A blanket and a slicker were all the additional weight
  that he dared to incorporate in each pack, because if they had to blow the
  safe and the noise were heard, they'd have to travel fast.</p>

  <p>Last of all, he got two canvas bags, the mouths of which could be closed
  with drawstrings. They had been prepared long before, and they were to hold
  the "inside lining" of the Merchants &amp; Miners Bank. When these had been
  folded under his arm, he looked at his clock and saw that it was getting on
  toward midnight. It was too early, he decided. It was not the time of night
  when Christian would want to make the attempt, because there were still too
  many people about the town.</p>

  <p>He lay down, intending to count the minutes, but he awakened with a
  terribly guilty start to find it was two-thirty, and the flame flickering in
  the lamp, as the oil was nearly exhausted.</p>

  <p>That reminded him of the dark lantern. He filled it from the oil can with
  kerosene, made sure that the shutter was well greased so that it would make
  no sound no matter how quickly it was opened and shut, and then he set
  out.</p>

  <p>If midnight had been too early, he felt that this hour was too late. Dawn
  came early at this season of the year&mdash;extra early, he always felt,
  among the mountains, and it would be nearly three o'clock before he arrived
  at the bank!</p>

  <p>In the meantime, what if the girl's emotions had got the better of her
  promise and induced her to speak to her father about his conduct? What if his
  suspicions had been aroused? What if he had come to doubt the integrity of
  his two watchmen? What if he had decided to post a second and secret guard
  for the watching of the bank, this night? It seemed possible, it seemed
  probable. It grew to a near certainty in the brain of Gregor before he
  finally had finished leading the horses up the gulch and had taken them from
  the edge of it to a group of young saplings that stood behind the bank.</p>

  <p>It was an excellent line of retreat to leave the bank, get the horses, and
  then depart from town by riding up the gulch. It was an excellent line unless
  they were pursued. In that case, they would have to take the straightest
  line, right through the main streets. The hair prickled on the head of Gregor
  as he thought of that possibility.</p>

  <p>He finished tethering the horses and stepped out into the open night. The
  bank was right before him, looking squat and strong as a fort. He had never
  realized that it was so large. He scanned the ground on all sides of it and
  saw nothing. There was a vacant lot on one side of it, and beyond the lot
  stood a boarding house, now silent and with unlighted windows. But the stars
  glimmered faintly on the black panes. The boarding house was as dangerous as
  could be; it was filled with young workingmen and was sure to have plenty of
  guns of all sorts in it. Young men sleep like wildcats. The least sound is
  enough to rouse them.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor himself felt twice as old as his twenty-eight years.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the bank there was a drygoods shop. The man and woman
  who ran it lived in a back room of the shop, but they would be fairly
  harmless, Gregor thought. "Dutch Charlie," the proprietor, was a red-faced,
  fat old man with a waddling step. He had not the look of a fighter, but in
  the West one cannot tell. The mildest "worm" may bite like a rattlesnake.</p>

  <p>Gregor, when he had finished this quick survey, went slowly on, stepping
  softly. He wished, now, that he had the quiet, natural stride of a fellow
  like Christian, to say nothing of that ghostly footfall of Taxi. There was
  Taxi to be thought of, in the immediate future, because he knew that when the
  bank job had ended, Christian would not fail to call in at the shack of Taxi
  and try to put him out of the way.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when Gregor heard Christian talk, it seemed to him that the
  great criminal hated Taxi more than he hated Jim Silver himself. And for a
  good reason. Taxi was an out-and-out crook who had learned to go "straight,"
  owing to the influence of Silver. And there is nothing that a criminal
  forgives less easily than virtue in one of his own kind.</p>

  <p>Down the eastern side of the bank, Gregor saw nothing, but when he was
  halfway along the wall, he was aware of something stealing up behind him. His
  brain spun. He felt sick in the pit of his stomach, and then, as he whirled
  with a gun in his hand, he saw, dimly against the starlight, the welcome and
  familiar outline of the head and shoulders of big Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>Christian came up to him and said:</p>

  <p>"All right, Duff. It's only me. You can be thankful that you didn't pull
  the gun on a stranger."</p>

  <p>Gregor felt mutely rebellious, but this was not a time for argument. With
  a clear foresight, he understood that, if he lived a thousand years in league
  with Christian, he would never be able to be entirely in the right. Something
  in him was lacking. Or did Christian merely carp?</p>

  <p>They paused at the side door of the bank. Christian took out his bunch of
  keys, opened the door, and led the way inside, saying casually:</p>

  <p>"It'll have to be the soup, brother. I've tried to work the combination
  already, but the wire trick hasn't worked. It hasn't been in the lock long
  enough to register the numbers for me."</p>

  <p>He spoke, it seemed to Duff Gregor, loudly enough to call the attention of
  everyone in the town. And already, in imagination, Gregor saw the streets
  filled with people hurrying toward the noise in the bank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; SAFE-CRACKING</h2>

  <p class="first">The greatest difficulty to be faced, once they started to
  work, was that a night lamp burned constantly inside the bank, and through
  the plate glass windows any passer-by along the street could see nearly every
  detail of what happened inside the big room. As a matter of fact, people who
  returned home late at night were very apt to pause and glance through the
  windows at the forest of bronze-gilt bars which were all that guarded the
  door of the safe. Even honest men may contemplate theft to which they would
  never put their hands.</p>

  <p>The first question that Gregor asked was: "How do we keep in the dark
  here?"</p>

  <p>"We don't," said Christian.</p>

  <p>He took the two canvas sacks, spread them out, and then hung them against
  the steel fence that ran between the front of the safe and the street
  windows.</p>

  <p>"This is the best we can do," he said.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" objected Gregor. "Anybody who looks in will be used to seeing
  the glimmering of the front of the safe! He'll notice the difference when his
  eye runs into those sacks."</p>

  <p>"People usually see what they expect to see, and nothing more," answered
  Christian.</p>

  <p>"But what if somebody comes along and uses his brain?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Every job like this is fifty per cent chance and luck," said Christian.
  "Would you want the money if it were simply given to you on a platter, Duff?
  I think better of you than that!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to mean what he said. But one never could tell what real
  thinking went on behind the mask of that smooth, easy voice and gentle
  intonation.</p>

  <p>"Hold a light. Open the shutter about halfway. You seem to have thought of
  a few of the necessaries," said Christian by way of compliment.</p>

  <p>Gregor kneeled and opened the shutter gingerly. In spite of his
  precautions in greasing the slides, it seemed to him that he heard a faint
  sound, and he jumped.</p>

  <p>"Sorry the thing makes so much noise. I greased it, anyway," said
  Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian laughed out loud. The sound roared and thundered in the ears of
  Gregor. He thought, for an instant, that his companion had gone mad.</p>

  <p>"We'll make more noise than that, before we're through," said
  Christian.</p>

  <p>He fell to work, straightway, running the mold of yellow laundry soap
  around the edges of the circular door. He worked rapidly, whistling to
  himself. Finally, when he had completed his work, he looked it over
  carefully. When he was certain that all was well&mdash;and this seemed to
  Gregor to have endured for an hour&mdash;he started pouring in the
  "soup."</p>

  <p>After that, the preparations went quickly. The fuse was attached. They
  hurried to a far corner of the big room after the fuse had been lighted by
  Gregor. There they lay flat on their faces, and Gregor listened to the
  bumping of his heart and wondered how flesh and blood could withstand such a
  strain.</p>

  <p>Then came the explosion. It was a thick, dull, puffing sound which seemed
  to be accompanied, as if in the great distance, by a far-off report.</p>

  <p>Gregor felt a distinct pressure, as he thought, on his whole body. He was
  up like a cat, but Christian was ahead of him. They ran into the safe room,
  and saw that the door of the safe was still fitted snugly in place!</p>

  <p>Gregor whirled about with a groan.</p>

  <p>"We're beaten! You bungled it! You bungled it like a great fool!" he said,
  and started to run.</p>

  <p>He ran straight into the hard fist of Christian. It bumped half the wits
  out of his head and deposited him with a solid thump on the floor of the
  bank.</p>

  <p>Staring up with dim, dazed eyes, he wondered, with what was left of his
  frightened brain, if Christian intended to double-cross him&mdash;to turn him
  over for the attempted job and drop the blame on his shoulders. Then he heard
  Christian saying calmly:</p>

  <p>"Don't run out like a yellow hound till you know the job's a lost job.
  Look here. The door's been budged a little. It's been budged and settled a
  shade. This crack on the top of it is a hair broader than the crack at the
  bottom, now. We can get some soup into that upper crack on the next try
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Next try?" exclaimed Duff Gregor, as he stumbled dizzily to his feet.
  "Are you goin' to be fool enough to wait here and make another try
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up and get to work," said Christian. "I'd rather walk up Salt Creek
  with my eyes open than to walk out of this place before I'm driven out. You
  said one true thing today. There's maybe half a million dollars inside that
  safe!"</p>

  <p>Gregor panted: "But that noise has been heard! We'd only stay here to be
  found out and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take that soap, what's left of it, and give me a hand," said the calm
  bandit. "We have to work faster this time, that's all. And we're sure to
  win."</p>

  <p>Gregor, staring mutely for a moment, was amazed to find himself bending to
  the task that had been assigned to him. All his volition was urging his heels
  to scamper away toward freedom, but his physical body he found bending there
  in front of the safe!</p>

  <p>Then came the thing that he had known would happen. There was a murmur of
  voices, dim and far away as the murmuring of bees. And then a hand shook at
  the front door of the bank, and succeeded in making it rattle faintly. He
  turned and stared past the two sacks that partially concealed them, and saw
  that a dozen people were gathered on the sidewalk, peering through the plate
  glass into the interior of the bank.</p>

  <p>Gregor turned to gasp out: "The sidewalk's full of 'em, but there's still
  the back door. Quick, Barry! We can get to the horses and run out of town
  before they tag us with lead, maybe."</p>

  <p>Christian caught his arm with a rigid hand.</p>

  <p>"Go out there and open the door and send 'em away!" he commanded. "Don't
  turn rotten and crumble to pieces on me. Remember that you're Jim Silver!
  Tell 'em anything. Tell 'em that a lamp exploded, but get 'em all out of the
  bank again. Understand? March, Gregor! I'll keep you covered till you get
  back to me!"</p>

  <p>Mad? Of course he was mad, but he was also armed, and the hand which held
  the Colt and covered Gregor was as steady as a stone. Duff Gregor did not
  argue. In another moment it seemed that the mob would break down the front
  door of the bank. Practically every penny of the savings of the men of Crow's
  Nest was lodged in the big safe of Henry Wilbur, and the inhabitants would be
  as tender of the safety of the bank as of their own lives. If that door went
  down before Gregor had accomplished anything, he had a very strong idea that
  the cruel devil in front of him would shoot him down before managing an
  escape.</p>

  <p>So Gregor turned without a word and walked toward the door.</p>

  <p>He could not believe that he was headed in that direction. He could not
  believe that he was actually waving to the men beyond the door, covering the
  sidewalk. He went through the motions like a sleepwalker, and always the cold
  consciousness of the revolver that watched him nudged him forward.</p>

  <p>Then he heard a general outcry: "Jim Silver! It's Jim Silver! There he
  comes. Everything's all right!"</p>

  <p>The sound of those words warmed the freezing soul of Duff Gregor. He threw
  open the front door of the bank and stood on the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what happened, Jim?" asked half a dozen of them at once. They
  pressed close. If he gave an inch, they would swarm in a stream into the
  bank, he knew. Therefore, he stood fast and merely said:</p>

  <p>"I was fixing the gasoline lamp, and the fool thing went poom all at once.
  It made a terrible racket. I don't wonder that it woke you up. Sorry,
  boys!"</p>

  <p>They began to smile and nod at him. It was a wild-looking crowd. Every man
  and youngster in the lot had a rifle, a shotgun, or a revolver showing. They
  had come out ready for business, and they looked the part.</p>

  <p>"How come you're on duty at night?" asked one lean, gray, suspicious old
  fox of a trapper.</p>

  <p>"Bennett's a little knocked out," said Duff Gregor, "so I'm staying
  around. Not that Tom really needs any help, but there's a lot of money in
  this bank, boys, and I sort of feel that the whole responsibility of watching
  it is on my shoulders. You know how it is."</p>

  <p>"Good old Silver," said one of the men. "We couldn't have the bank better
  watched if we had ten men on the job day and night."</p>

  <p>The crowd began to break up, and Duff Gregor, with amazement, watched them
  go. It was too simple; it was too easy. Suddenly he was struck with awe for
  the wisdom of Barry Christian, who had foreseen exactly what would
  happen.</p>

  <p>While still a few lingered, Gregor closed and locked the front door,
  hearing one of the bystanders remark:</p>

  <p>"Suppose that a gent was to break into that there bank and think that he
  had pretty clear sailing, and suppose that up out of a corner comes Jim
  Silver at him&mdash;wouldn't it be hell on him, eh?"</p>

  <p>And they laughed, as Duff Gregor closed that door and shut out their
  voices to a dimness.</p>

  <p>Before he reached the safe room again, the last of the men had scattered
  from the sidewalk. In front of the safe he found Barry Christian already
  calmly at work, running the mold with his swift, cunning fingers.</p>

  <p>Without looking up from what he was doing, he said: "You did that well,
  Gregor. You're a man, partner. A real man. And these people of Crow's Nest
  are real geese. All honest people are fools, or else they wouldn't be honest.
  Duff, you and I are going to do things together. We may crack a sweeter nut
  than this, even, one of these days."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor, squinting at the future, was not sure that he wished to
  remain in partnership with a man like Barry Christian, who was himself
  fearless and who demanded heroism of all who worked with him. And yet there
  was a wonderful glory and exhilaration in being with that famous man. The
  future looked like a storm, but like a golden storm.</p>

  <p>He set about working as fast as he could to help Christian. They finished
  their preparations once more, and the last of the "soup" was poured into the
  mold. Over the top of the safe door they now battened rugs and carpets in
  thick masses, and when they had lighted the fuse and retired, there was at
  last an explosion far more muffled than the first one. Even so, the entire
  building jarred, and the windows shook and jingled like so many great
  castanets.</p>

  <p>They got up from the floor where they had been lying and ran forward. They
  saw that the huge door of the safe had swung wide open on its hinges, and,
  with a cry of joy, Gregor leaped forward and thrust into the inner door the
  key with which it was always opened. It had not been hard to get that key
  from its hiding place in the cashier's desk, because no one considered the
  inner door of the safe of such very great importance. It was important enough
  now to make the heart of Gregor stand still, because, no matter how he turned
  and twisted, he could not budge the inner bolt. Then he understood. The force
  of the explosion which had knocked the outer door open had served to jam,
  hopelessly, the lock of the inner door!</p>

  <p>He turned a desperate face toward Barry Christian, and beyond him he saw
  the gray of the morning come shimmering through the eastern windows of the
  bank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE LOOT</h2>

  <p class="first">Neither of them spoke. Christian made a gesture that forced
  Gregor to recoil while the chief partner himself took the key and worked with
  it for an instant. Then, in turn, he stood back, dusted off his hands, and
  nodded. He whirled on his heel, left the safe room, and it suddenly occurred
  to Gregor that Christian, in silence, was going to walk off and give up the
  job.</p>

  <p>He was wrong. Christian returned in a moment, bringing with him a small
  sack of padded canvas, which he laid on the floor and unrolled. It contained
  a good kit of burglary tools. Christian took out a mallet made of soft iron
  and a pair of untempered steel wedges, with points drawn down as fine as a
  pin. He wrapped the head of the mallet in cloth, laid the edge of a wedge
  against the top crack of the inner door of the safe, and began to tap gently.
  He tapped with force hardly sufficient to break an egg, then with greater and
  greater effort until the dull, padded sound of the blows was louder than a
  drumbeat in the frightened ears of Gregor.</p>

  <p>Then Gregor forgot his fears, for he saw that the first wedge had actually
  entered a little. Yes, more than that&mdash;the wedge was not only entering,
  but the door was beginning to groan under the strain. If the door could be
  made to yield the least bit to the first narrow wedge, the second one would
  soon have an entrance with its greater bevel and weight.</p>

  <p>In fact, that door was presently bending like a bow along the upper edge.
  Two wedges were shifted down the forward face, close to the lock, and driven
  in side by side. Before the heels of them had disappeared, the lock burst
  with a sound like a snapping piano wire. The little door came shuddering
  open, and there appeared before the eyes of Duff Gregor the most beautiful
  sight in the world&mdash;a series of little, bright, polished-steel drawers,
  each to be opened with its separate key.</p>

  <p>But they did not need to pause in order to fit the keys. Having passed the
  first barriers, these that remained were nothing. With a wedge and a little
  fine steel crowbar, the expert hands of Barry Christian pried open those
  drawers rapidly. Into the two capacious canvas sacks, which had already done
  a different sort of duty on this night, the riches of the mountains began to
  be dropped, in the form of bonds of all sorts of paper wealth; but most of
  all, the hearts of the pair were gladdened by the treasure in hard cash.</p>

  <p>It would not have been there if a few more weeks had passed. It would have
  gone into safe forms of investment, of course; but, in the meantime, the
  sudden jump in prestige which the bank had enjoyed since the arrival of "Jim
  Silver" had flooded the big safe with quantities of paper money.</p>

  <p>That money was snatched out and handed into the sacks. Only one thick
  packet enchanted the eye and the touch of Duff Gregor that he could not give
  up to the sack. It was a beautiful, thick sheaf of fifties, almost brand-new,
  stiff and firm as a board and full half an inch thick. He could not resist
  passing that wad into his own pocket. He knew that Christian marked him, but
  that did not matter. It was not the question of stealing the money, but the
  joy of having it intimately under his fingers and pressing in a lump against
  his body. He felt not only a richer but a better and more important man. He
  felt that Fate would not hand out such favors and fortune as this except to a
  friend.</p>

  <p>He had his grasp on the throat of the world, he felt, and the world would
  have to pay for his hold before he was finished with it.</p>

  <p>That was the mind of amiable Gregor as they finished loading the canvas
  sacks, and, looking out of the window, saw that the gray of the morning was
  turning to rose.</p>

  <p>They got to the back door of the bank, unlocked it, and listened. The town
  was wakening. The gambling and playing element must still be snoring, and its
  members would continue to sleep until noon; but the others, the workers,
  would be up before the sun.</p>

  <p>The vacant lot was pearl-gray with dew. As they started for the horses, a
  boy began to whistle like a lark. They saw him come over the grass in bare,
  brown feet. He left a double streak of darkness behind him, where he had
  knocked the moisture off the grass.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian turned a bit toward his friend and in a soft but profound
  voice he cursed that boy and all his forebears.</p>

  <p>They tied the bags to the saddles and mounted as the boy came up to
  them.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hullo, Jim," said the youngster. "Whatcha doin' up this time of day?
  You don't go to work for three, four hours yet. And how come that you ain't
  back there in the bank, Mr. Bennett?"</p>

  <p>He cocked his head on one side and peered at them. He was as bright and
  keen as a magpie, and just as cruelly mischievous.</p>

  <p>"I've got my helper on the job, son," said Barry. He turned his horse.</p>

  <p>"Hey, who's your helper?" asked the boy. "Whatcha mean? Who's your helper?
  I didn't know that you had a helper."</p>

  <p>"So long, son!" said Gregor.</p>

  <p>They began to jog their horses, but not in the direction up the gulch in
  which, as Gregor knew, his chief wanted to travel. Instead, Christian was
  heading straight across the town.</p>

  <p>The boy actually came scampering after them. He had a voice as clear and
  chanting loud as the voice of a rooster&mdash;a new, young rooster delighted
  with his task of rousing the world in the morning.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Jim!" he yelled. "Where you goin'? Who's the new man in the bank?
  How come you both are off work?"</p>

  <p>That voice went like a hot needle through and through the brain of Duff
  Gregor. They turned up the first side alley. A woman was coming in from the
  woodpile behind the house, her apron filled with wood. She paused and shaded
  her eyes, looking into the bright east toward those two early travelers.</p>

  <p>When she saw Gregor, she actually dropped the wood so that she could clap
  her hands together, and she shouted:</p>

  <p>"Hi, Jim Silver! Go it, Jim! Good luck to ye, boy!"</p>

  <p>They passed out of sight of her, and still the shrill voice of the boy was
  piping in the distance.</p>

  <p>"The devil take him! He's started the town on the trail with his yelling,"
  said Christian. "He'll be back there at the bank, in a minute, and then he'll
  be pretty sure to look around to see my helper. If he doesn't spy the open
  door of the safe the first thing, I'll be surprised."</p>

  <p>"But why take this direction? I thought you wanted to ride up through the
  gulch! That's the best way to get out of Crow's Nest. There's regular
  hole-in-the-wall country behind those hills."</p>

  <p>"Because I want to start in a false direction, Duff," said Christian.
  "We've not finished the hardest part of this job yet."</p>

  <p>"Not finished it? Not when we've bamboozled the town and cracked the safe
  for them? What do you call hard?" said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"I call it hard," answered Christian, "to get away from a thousand or so
  men who have good horses and who know how to shoot straight and who are going
  to keep on our trail until their feet wear out under them. Gregor, they
  trusted you as they would have no one else on earth, and when they find we've
  cheated 'em and that you're gone, those men are going to go practically
  insane. Believe me, because I know. Every man in Crow's Nest is going to be a
  bloodhound, and when the news gets out on the range, everybody in the
  mountains will be gunning for us."</p>

  <p>They had cleared the outskirts of Crow's Nest, by this time, and, coming
  to a narrow, rocky gorge that headed west, Christian at once turned down
  it.</p>

  <p>"You're wasting time and distance," cautioned Gregor. "If these people
  around here are goin' to be as savage as you say, isn't it our best dodge to
  get a few miles between us and Crow's Nest&mdash;and lay it out in a straight
  line?"</p>

  <p>"We stop and pick up Taxi first," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Gregor threw up his hands with a shout of dismay.</p>

  <p>"Are you a clean fool? Are you goin' to be a hog, Barry?" he cried. "We've
  got the coin. We're loaded down with it. Are you goin' to risk everything in
  order to sink a slug of lead in that wildcat, that Taxi? Can't we leave him
  for another trip?"</p>

  <p>"I've got him marked down. He's waiting, like a horse in a stall," said
  Christian. "D'you think that ten times this money would be worth to me what
  it would mean to brush Taxi out of my way for good and all?"</p>

  <p>The other stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Barry," he said at last, "you are crazy. You're blood crazy!"</p>

  <p>Christian looked back at him with an impassive face.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll separate here," he said. "I thought we'd better go on farther
  before we divided the loot, but we'll make the cut here, and then each of us
  can go his own way."</p>

  <p>They dismounted, accordingly, and in the shelter of a nest of rocks in the
  center of the gorge they dumped the contents of both sacks on top of the flat
  of one of them. The treasure overflowed and ran out on the ground. The wind
  came and whispered through the precious papers.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Duff Gregor, feeling that he was entirely in the hands
  of this terrible partner. "What percentage do I get?"</p>

  <p>"Fifty per cent," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Gregor stared. He stared until his mouth opened, though not on speech.</p>

  <p>"It's more'n I expected," he said finally. "You been all the brains."</p>

  <p>The words had been wrung from him. He regretted them instantly. But
  Christian said:</p>

  <p>"I always get fifty per cent. I never take more. If I do a job all by
  myself, I never take more than half. The rest goes to charity, to a
  friend&mdash;it's not my luck to take more than half."</p>

  <p>The strangeness of that superstition staggered Gregor. It was hard for him
  to feel gratitude. He felt no gratitude now but merely wonder. Then he found
  an explanation.</p>

  <p>All men, he told himself, who were geniuses, had something twisted and
  queer in their make-ups. They all had to have something queer. It was what
  struck the balance. Christian was a genius. There was no doubt that this
  devil had plenty of excess brains, but he was also a freak. It was better,
  Gregor felt, to have only normal brains like his own, than to have the excess
  talent of a Barry Christian and to throw away opportunities.</p>

  <p>In a case like this, for instance, he was being overpaid twice, and all
  because Christian was the silly victim of a superstition!</p>

  <p>He did not pause to shake his head over the thing. He started, at once,
  counting the money.</p>

  <p>Even at that business, Christian was three or four times as rapid as his
  less-gifted companion. And when it came to estimating the value of the
  negotiable paper that they had taken, Christian seemed able to get at the
  truth in a glance. They added up the result, and Barry Christian it was who
  announced:</p>

  <p>"We've each got a shade over two hundred thousand dollars, old son. This
  little job is going to make history. And&mdash;here's where we say
  good-by."</p>

  <p>But a wild enthusiasm overmastered the more cautious instinct of Duff
  Gregor when he heard the size of the fortune that had come into his hands. He
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"No, Barry! I was talking like a fool. I'm goin' to stay with you. We'll
  clean up Taxi together, and then we'll go and conquer the whole world!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; TAXI'S SURPRISE</h2>

  <p class="first">Taxi had been awake all night. As the dawn began, he
  remained hunched over his table in the shack. He was only partially dressed
  because he had been about to go to bed when his attention had become absorbed
  in a work of art. He had one shoe on and one off. His coat had been thrown
  aside. His necktie had been removed and his shirt was open at the throat. One
  of his cuffs was unbuttoned.</p>

  <p>Most men would have caught a severe chill from exposure in such a garb as
  this while sitting motionless through the cold of the night, and Taxi had
  hardly stirred a hand for many hours. But he was warmed by the eager,
  electric vibration of his enthusiasm that cherished the vital spark in him.
  He had not so much as rolled or lighted a cigarette. He was unaware of any
  need of the body. His throat was dry, but he did not heed hunger, cold, or
  thirst.</p>

  <p>And the work of art which was before him on the table, and to which he had
  given his whole soul during the entire night, was a steel lock, not
  overlarge.</p>

  <p>It was, in fact, a very neat and fine bit of metal work; but what
  interested Taxi was not the goodness of the material but the clever brain of
  the inventor who had created this master lock. It was guaranteed to baffle
  all the brains in the criminal world. Nothing but the power to blast it to
  pieces would be sufficient to open that lock, the maker had declared, and
  Taxi had specially bought the lock so that he could work on it. It was a
  habit of his to get the finest productions of the locksmith and then lavish
  on them his own keen talents. Usually the investment of a mere hour or two
  was enough to solve the problem, but on this occasion he had been up the
  entire night working with his various picklocks.</p>

  <p>He had taken out his set of burglar's tools which he carried about with
  him in various parts of his clothes. Tools made as if they were precious
  jewels, without regard to expense, all constructed of alloys of incredible
  strength and lightness, tools so slender that they would have crumpled in the
  grip of an ordinary workman. But though they were so meager that most of them
  could be unjointed and hidden under the seams of his clothes, yet in the
  expert fingers of Taxi those little tools could cut their way through the
  secrets of the most powerful safes.</p>

  <p>The principle, with Taxi, was to find the right point, the weak unit in
  the chain, and then apply brains and a cutting edge. Failure was a thing to
  which he was a stranger, simply because he would not admit its
  possibility.</p>

  <p>He did not need most of those tools for the delicate task which was in his
  hands now, but he had laid out a great portion of them here simply because he
  liked to have them around him. They inspired him with the recollection of
  many another knotty problem in the past which, he, unaided, had solved.</p>

  <p>Consider him now, leaning over that fine lock with half-closed eyes,
  looking like a poet who, with pen poised above the paper, waits for the voice
  of the muse. But, instead of a pen, the sensitive fingers of Taxi held a bit
  of watch-spring steel. His finely made, handsome face showed no expression
  except, now and then, for a slight flicker of the nostrils.</p>

  <p>But in reality he was almost a maniac with nerves. He could have leaped up
  from his chair and torn at his hair, screaming. Wild horses of desperation
  and fury were ready to tear him. And the more he controlled himself, the more
  wildly his nerves raged to have their expression.</p>

  <p>He wanted to catch up the lock and dash it against a rock. He wanted to
  smash it to pieces. He wanted to rush out and set fire to the trees and curse
  and yell and rave as the flames soared in a terrible wave over the
  mountainsides.</p>

  <p>Instead, he held himself firmly in hand. That little smile that
  occasionally curled at his lips was the stern sign of his tyranny over his
  flesh and his weaker spirits. He despised the elements which were working to
  master him.</p>

  <p>The night wore away into the gray of the morning. He was not aware of the
  change. Born and bred as he had been in the darkness of the great cities of
  the East, he knew little about sunrises and sunsets. Electric light had shone
  on nine-tenths of the hours of his life until, at last, something hardly more
  than chance had brought him west and into sudden and vital contact with Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>There in the West he had remained, but always his heart was turning back
  to the land he knew&mdash;that underworld in which he had been a hero. He was
  a hero in the West, also, with a growing name, because he was the one man in
  the world whom Jim Silver would willingly take on a trail. He had shown
  himself fearless, able to endure the most devilish torments rather than be
  untrue to his friend. And for all of these ample reasons he was admired and
  respected.</p>

  <p>He was so admired and respected that the officers of the law who came
  west, now and again, on some old trail that pointed in his direction, were
  never able to get their hands on him. Or, if they did, public opinion,
  expressed by the heavy public hand, tore him suddenly away from the grasp of
  the law.</p>

  <p>But now, as he sat there in the shack among the Rockies, his mind and his
  soul were lost in the work of the locksmith, and the only environment of
  which he was at all aware was that of crime&mdash;the one surrounding with
  which he was truly familiar.</p>

  <p>He had even forgotten that it was not an electric or a gas light by which
  he worked, but only the tremulous, yellow flame of a lamp. He was by no means
  conscious of the beginnings of the day. The universe had no existence for
  him. He seemed more and more the perfect type of the dreamer or the abstruse
  speculator, except, now and again, when he raised his eyes and glanced aside,
  for then it was that the pale brightness of his eyes showed something worthy
  to be feared, though those side glances were directed only at the inward
  processes of his own mind.</p>

  <p>Such was the mental state of Taxi when a shadow stirred.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily that shadow would not have been seen by usual mortals, simply
  because other men would not have had the doors of their cabins open at this
  hour in the day.</p>

  <p>Neither would it have been seen by Taxi himself, no matter what the
  sharpness of his senses, except that he was so deeply involved in his
  speculations that in this very instant he was drawing close, he felt, to the
  solution of his problem. Therefore, his subconscious mind was in total charge
  of him, and the subconscious mind of Taxi, like that of a cat or a wolf, was
  a very safe guardian, no matter how the master slept.</p>

  <p>That subconscious self it was that suddenly jarred the mind of Taxi back
  to full awareness of the world, just in time to see a mere shadow, a mere
  hint of a guess at a living form, glide into a patch of shrubbery hardly
  fifty feet from the door.</p>

  <p>It was a shock to Taxi to come out of the world of the mind into the world
  of fact. It was a shock to him to see, around him, the wretched rawness of
  the rickety old cabin in which he was sitting, and the huge, grim beauty of
  the mountains of the morning beyond his door. It was a shock to say to
  himself, like a guilty creature of the night: "This is the day. What are you
  doing here where the things of the day will soon be able to see you?"</p>

  <p>But it was still the subconscious mind that brought an automatic pistol
  into his hand. He did not have to think twice. If it were an animal, there
  would be no great harm in hitting it; if it were a man&mdash;what chance in a
  million of that?&mdash;men should not be furtively stealing about a lone
  cabin at this hour of the day.</p>

  <p>And then all the nervous rage which had been boiling in Taxi overflowed.
  He gritted his teeth so hard that they groaned together, and he sent a burst
  of three bullets right into the brush.</p>

  <p>A curse and a yell answered him, and then a rifle shot that clipped
  through both walls of the cabin at about the level of his head.</p>

  <p>He disregarded the open door and danger beyond it, however. There was also
  the window and its battered shutter to the side, and he sprang to guard
  against a flank attack, without even having to hesitate to make sure that
  this was the right course.</p>

  <p>What he saw beyond that window gave pause even to his steel-cold courage,
  for yonder, in the act of springing to get to shelter behind an outcropping
  of rocks, was none other than the great Barry Christian, no longer with the
  make-up of Thomas Bennett, though still in Bennett's clothes.</p>

  <p>It was such a crushing blow to the wits of Taxi that he hesitated through
  a priceless interval&mdash;an interval, let us say, of a hundredth part of a
  second&mdash;and the result was that he fired just a foot too late. Barry
  Christian was already in shelter behind the rocks, and his return fire was
  drilling through and through the cabin.</p>

  <p>Taxi dropped to one knee, gasping.</p>

  <p>If Barry Christian was the reality behind the man who had appeared to be
  Bennett, then who was the Jim Silver that Taxi had met in the hotel at Crow's
  Nest?</p>

  <p>He remembered now&mdash;it was not the first time he had thought about
  it&mdash;the husky, faint voice of Silver, the dimness of the room, the
  strange order which sent him out of town to wait for further instructions.
  All of these might well be the devices of men trying to keep him from seeing,
  in a clear light, that it was not Jim Silver in person who had been in that
  room.</p>

  <p>And yet, what man in the world would be such a fool as to attempt to play
  the role of Jim Silver?</p>

  <p>Well, why not? There was nothing so very peculiar about the appearance of
  Silver. And, after all, his habit of living chiefly in the wilderness had
  shielded him from the eyes of most men. He was chiefly known, to be sure, by
  the silver spots in his hair above the temples that had given him his name,
  and by the magnificence of his horse, Parade.</p>

  <p>At any rate, it was certain that yonder was Bennett, that Bennett was
  Barry Christian, and that, therefore, Christian had been in the hotel room
  where Taxi thought that he had talked with Silver.</p>

  <p>The thing reduced to an absurdity. A devil and an angel would meet for
  conversation far more easily than Silver and Christian could be confined to
  one room.</p>

  <p>It was not Jim Silver, then, that he had seen. It was the order of a
  masquerader, a scoundrelly pretender, that had sent Taxi out there into the
  country to wait until Christian and his friend were ready to take his
  scalp!</p>

  <p>No wonder that the reeling brain of Taxi needed a few moments to absorb
  these facts.</p>

  <p>He was roused to the need for action by the plucking fingers of a bullet
  that had flicked through the loose flap of shirt that hung at his side.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian, with his rifle fire, was methodically raking the floor of
  the cabin, shooting only a few inches above it. There would be no time to
  burrow down into the ground and secure safety in this manner, as in a trench.
  And, in the meantime, the second enemy, the unknown man, the false Silver,
  was firing either hip-high or breast-high.</p>

  <p>Even if Taxi put off the fatal moment for an instant, he could be sure
  that they would soon have him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. THE POSSE</h2>

  <p class="first">Taxi looked about him. He was so desperate that he even
  considered standing up on the table, so that it might be unlikely that the
  bullets would strike any part of him except the legs. Then he took note of
  another possibility.</p>

  <p>The cabin was built with a center post to the top of which were led four
  beams from the corners of the shack, as though the original builder had
  planned to build a little attic for a storeroom. Where those four beams met,
  it was possible that he might find a sort of humble crow's nest in which he
  could be safe from any but high-ranging bullets.</p>

  <p>He stepped onto the table, jumped, caught the rafter nearest to him, and
  swung up onto the top of it. Lying out across the top of the beams, he was
  then fairly safe. The trouble was, however, that he could not see the enemy
  if they made a sudden rush attack on the house.</p>

  <p>The rifle fire ended momentarily.</p>

  <p>"Taxi! Oh, Taxi!" called the voice of Barry Christian. "Come out and talk
  to me."</p>

  <p>Taxi said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Taxi," called Christian, "on my word and honor as a gentleman, I won't
  harm you. Come out here and talk to us. We'll have a truce."</p>

  <p>Taxi smiled. He had a very accurate idea of what the word and honor of
  Barry Christian were worth in such a time as this.</p>

  <p>"There's no use holding out on me," said Christian. "I can burn you out,
  you fool, if you put me to it. But what I really want is a chance to talk
  with you."</p>

  <p>They might, as a matter of fact, burn out Taxi, but in the meantime they
  would have some trouble. Around the cabin there was nothing but grass, rocks,
  and brush. If there were a sufficient wind blowing, they might start a pile
  of dry brush burning and let it roll with the wind against the house. But
  there was no wind to help them, just now.</p>

  <p>Taxi lay still. If he answered, the direction from which his voice came
  might suggest to the cunning ears of Christian that Taxi was lying well above
  the level of the floor.</p>

  <p>The silence of Taxi brought a few curses from Christian. It was strange
  how well the voice carried through the stillness of the mountain air.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we've nicked him!" called the voice of the second man, from the
  other side of the cabin. "Maybe he's dead, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You can't kill that much poison as cheaply as that," answered
  Christian.</p>

  <p>Taxi smiled a twisted smile at the compliment. He looked down at the
  table. Half of his soul yearned to be seated there, regardless of flying
  bullets, at work over the problem of the lock.</p>

  <p>Christian was calling: "You let him see you, you wool-headed fool! You let
  him see you, and I told you that he has eyes like a hawk. I hope he shot a
  hole through the middle of you."</p>

  <p>"He only nicked my cheek," answered the other. "Blast him! I went softer
  than an owl through the air. How could I guess that he could see me? I
  thought that he'd be asleep. It was all quiet There was no smoke coming out
  of the chimney. How could I tell, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You could have done what I told you to do," answered Christian. "If I
  ever tackle a job again with you for a partner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He clipped off his speech, and perhaps vented some of his rage by firing
  three shots in rapid succession through the rotten walls.</p>

  <p>Taxi could hear the dull, chugging sounds as the bullets chopped through
  the rotten timber. He could see the little eyelets of light appear.</p>

  <p>The man from the other side had opened in turn, firing sometimes high and
  sometimes low. They were honeycombing the shack, and it was only a question
  of time before they whipped some lead into the body of Taxi.</p>

  <p>He stood up on the top of the center post. In this manner he could look
  out of the little triangular window which had been cut in the roof of the
  shanty, and he saw clearly the jerking muzzle of a rifle as it was fired
  again and again from the patch of brush. There was no sign of the enemy, but
  Taxi saw that something had to be risked, even if his position were revealed.
  He took aim at a point above the rifle and a yard behind it. Then he fired
  three shots in a row. It was his way, because he liked to group the bullets
  of an automatic, making them fly like a little spray of water.</p>

  <p>He got for a reward a yelp of pain and fear. The rifle disappeared. There
  was a sound of crashing in the brush.</p>

  <p>"Up high!" yelled the voice of Christian's friend. "Up high. He's up near
  the top of the roof."</p>

  <p>"Did he get you?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>"He scraped my shoulder for me. I'm goin' to boil him in oil before I'm
  finished with him!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, the fire centered high on the walls, and Taxi heard the
  intimate humming of the bullets about his head and body. Another bullet
  clipped his clothes, drilling through the flap of his trousers leg. He
  dropped flat to the floor.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Christian must have heard the noise, nevertheless, for now
  a bullet from his side of the house struck the earth and threw a stinging
  shower of it into the face of Taxi.</p>

  <p>He leaped to a far corner of the shack. The eyes of the devil seemed to be
  following him, looking through the solid wood with ease, for another bullet
  instantly clipped a lock of hair from his head. It was the end. They had him
  on the run, and they would beat the life out of him with the flying lead in a
  few moments, he knew.</p>

  <p>And then the voice of Christian's companion loudly yelped: "They're
  comin'! They're right in the pass, now. Get out of here, Barry!"</p>

  <p>A terrible oath ripped out of the throat of Christian. He fired six shots,
  high and low, in rapid succession. Perhaps he was emptying his rifle. Then
  there was silence.</p>

  <p>Taxi counted to twenty before he ventured to the door of the shack. It was
  not a sham to draw him outside, for now he could hear the distant muttering
  of the hoofs of many horses, and immediately afterward there was the
  galloping beat of a pair receding from the neighborhood of the cabin.</p>

  <p>There was no use mounting his own horse to pursue Barry Christian and one
  other through mountains that Barry knew like a book. And, therefore, Taxi sat
  down at the lock and began to work over it with the bit of watch-spring
  steel!</p>

  <p>He was lost in the problem. He was still very deep in it when the noise of
  the horses increased to a thundering that shook the earth and made the stove
  jingle softly in the corner of the shack. With the tenth part of his mind,
  Taxi was aware of these things. The rest of his wits were entirely
  concentrated on the problem of the lock, when the squeaking of saddle leather
  announced that men were dismounting near the cabin.</p>

  <p>Then they came pouring in.</p>

  <p>He gave another twist to the picklock. It would not work&mdash;yes,
  something was yielding.</p>

  <p>"It's Taxi," said a loud voice. "It's his side kicker, Taxi."</p>

  <p>Another said: "Taxi, what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Taxi. And suddenly the lock had yielded to his hands. He
  pulled it open. It lay mastered before him. In ten seconds, on the next try,
  he would know how to master that delicate combination. After all, it had been
  simple&mdash;but unexpected&mdash;the way all good brain work is apt to
  be.</p>

  <p>At last he looked up as a big fellow in a checkered flannel shirt came up
  to him, smelling strongly of horse sweat, and dropped a hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We want some talk out of you!" said the stranger.</p>

  <p>Taxi raised his pale, overbright eyes and stared into the other's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Take your hand off my shoulder!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>The hand was instantly taken away as one of the other men said:</p>

  <p>"Look out, Mack! He's poison."</p>

  <p>Mack stood back a little, but he spread his legs as though bracing himself
  to endure a shock.</p>

  <p>"I'll take my hand off you, but maybe not for long. Your dirty skunk of a
  partner, Jim Silver, has been up here, and we want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He dodged, but too late. Taxi, coming out of his chair like a cat, lodged
  the bony ridge of his knuckles on the point of Mack's jaw and dropped him
  staggering back into the arms of some of his friends.</p>

  <p>Then, for a split part of a second, Taxi expected death to spout from the
  muzzles of a dozen leveled guns. Yet not a shot was fired, for another man
  said:</p>

  <p>"Mack's been rushin' things too fast. Wait a minute. Here, you, Taxi. Open
  up and talk. You talk, or we will raise hell with you. You know that Silver's
  been play actin' watchman down at Henry Wilbur's bank in Crow's Nest. Now

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; SILVER'S ARRIVAl</h2>

  <p class="first">There are times when words won't serve. Taxi felt that one
  of these times had come. He never liked the weight of many eyes on him. There
  was a guilty something in him that made him prefer dark loneliness to the
  public gaze. The same instinct, from a different and a guiltless cause,
  worked in Jim Silver, and that had helped to make the two men friends. They
  knew how to spend a silent day and night together without thinking hostile
  thoughts of one another.</p>

  <p>Taxi could only say the first and the greatest truth, about this matter,
  that sprang into his head, which was simply:</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver would never take a job as the watchman of a bank."</p>

  <p>Someone laughed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Sure he didn't. But he took a job as the robber! He walked right in there
  and made fools of us, and he walked off again with the coin. He's been up
  here. He's seen you, Taxi, and he's told you about his plans. There ain't any
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>"There's a doubt that it was Jim Silver," said Taxi.</p>

  <p>"What?" came the shout. "Doubt, d'you say? Even down to the silver spots
  over his temples and the gold and shine of Parade, it was Jim Silver, all
  right!"</p>

  <p>Taxi considered.</p>

  <p>"We're losin' time," said Mack, rubbing his swollen jaw and staring
  hungrily at Taxi. "I vote that we count to ten, and then, if he don't speak,
  see if we can drag some talk out of him at the end of a lariat!"</p>

  <p>"You can't drag nothin' out of him," doubted another speaker. "Not if Jim
  Silver is in the case. You can't drag nothin' out. Not even Barry Christian
  was able to do that, and Barry had time to work on him, they say!"</p>

  <p>"Are we goin' to stand around here and let a little crook out of the East
  gum up the deal for us?" shouted Mack.</p>

  <p>"I say it wasn't Silver," said Taxi quietly. "Silver's my friend. Would he
  do work like this?"</p>

  <p>He pointed at the walls of the shack, through which eyeholes had been
  recently drilled by bits cleaner than ever an auger bored.</p>

  <p>"What does that prove?" Mack said. "Taxi just stepped outside, and they
  drilled a few holes through the house to prove that they wasn't his friends.
  But it's all a lie, and you'll find that the whole bunch of loot has been
  cached here with Taxi. Don't that make a plan for you? The pair of 'em do the
  dirty work down there in Crow's Nest, and Taxi waits up here to take the
  loot! What's simpler than that?"</p>

  <p>"Would he be fool enough to start a cannonade that was sure to lead the
  lot of you right up on his trail?" asked Taxi.</p>

  <p>This gave even Mack pause, but only for an instant.</p>

  <p>"He knew that we was comin' right up the pass after him, anyways. It
  didn't take much time. One of 'em did the shootin' while you and the other
  one hid the loot. Taxi, walk us to that stuff."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one reason why you're wrong," said Taxi. He pointed to the
  hole that had been shot in his shirt. The skin had been barely pricked,
  enough to let out a red stain of blood.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden grunt of interest, a sound such as a man makes when a
  blow lands on him solidly.</p>

  <p>Taxi leaned down and pointed to the flap of his trousers. There was
  another hole bitten through the cloth, there.</p>

  <p>One by one, the men crowded nearer. There were thirty of them filling up
  all the available space. Gloomy conviction appeared in their faces, though
  Mack now cried out:</p>

  <p>"All part of the fake! They shoot a coupla holes in the clothes of
  Taxi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Close enough to cut his skin, eh?" said one of the men. "Don't be a fool,
  Mack! Boys, we gotta ride! Whatever Taxi is, he ain't in on this deal. If Jim
  Silver is mean enough to turn crooked, he's mean enough to double-cross a
  friend of his like Taxi, too."</p>

  <p>"You talk like a half-wit," said the calm, gentle voice of Taxi. "Tell me
  this&mdash;would Jim Silver and Barry Christian be riding together?"</p>

  <p>"Who said they were? It's Silver and Tom Bennett," answered a posse
  man.</p>

  <p>"Bennett is Barry Christian," said Taxi, "and your Jim Silver is some
  crook made up to look like my friend."</p>

  <p>Incredulous heads were shaken. Only in one or two pairs of eyes appeared
  the least flicker of doubt.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing here," urged a number of the men. "Let's get out and
  start moving. Silver's gaining ground on us at every jump!"</p>

  <p>"Let him get a lead. Who could catch Parade, anyway?" asked another.</p>

  <p>"That's true," said another. "But we gotta keep travelin'. They ain't both
  got a Parade under 'em."</p>

  <p>They streamed out of the shack, and Mack, still scowling at Taxi, called
  out as he mounted his horse:</p>

  <p>"Keep out of my path, brother. And, if you've got much sense, you won't
  bother around the town of Crow's Nest, neither. Jim Silver is wanted there,
  right now, but his friends ain't!"</p>

  <p>That was the last warning, as the cavalcade poured back through the trees
  to take the main road across the pass.</p>

  <p>It was not the direction which Christian and his companion had taken, but
  Taxi did not try to correct the men, for he knew that his advice was wanted
  no more than he had wanted the advice of Mack.</p>

  <p>One thing was perfectly clear to him, and this was that he must ride at
  once for the town of Crow's Nest. If the false Jim Silver had done harm
  there, if the crime had actually been the robbing of the famous bank, then it
  was high time for the friends of the real Jim Silver to appear on the scene
  to discover what had actually happened.</p>

  <p>It was at about this time that the true Jim Silver sent Parade up the last
  slope toward the town of Crow's Nest. It had been a hard ride from the forest
  of yellow birches, where the bearded man with the bright eyes had given him
  the information that made him speed toward the town. He had made a quick
  trip. Parade had traveled as only Parade knew how to move over rough and
  smooth, and yet, for all his speed, Jim Silver was arriving late by a few
  vital hours.</p>

  <p>He was very weary, but weariness was a thing to which he was accustomed,
  and which he knew how to master so as to leave his mind fresh and his body
  prepared for hard action. Out of the power of his will he could refresh
  himself sufficiently.</p>

  <p>He was not received, now, as his alias had been welcomed not many days
  before. He was well into the town, in fact, before he was sighted. And then
  it was the solitary, shrill voice of a woman that sent the news pealing down
  the main street of Crow's Nest:</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver's come back! Jim Silver's come back!"</p>

  <p>After that, men began to appear. There was no cheering. Every man who
  appeared had a gun in his hand, a sight so strange that Silver could hardly
  believe his eyes. No one called out to him. There was no waving of hands.</p>

  <p>The heart of Jim Silver was so free from vanity that he felt no real pain
  at this lack of a reception, but he was puzzled by the grimness of the faces
  that stared at him.</p>

  <p>If the grown-ups were so silent, at least the little boys and girls should
  have been running out, clapping their hands and yelling with pleasure at the
  sight of the great Parade. But, instead of giving him the slightest greeting,
  the children remained in the background, agape, silent, and mothers could be
  seen gathering in their offspring as though there had been danger of an
  approaching storm.</p>

  <p>As Silver rode on, he was aware that men were swarming out into the street
  behind him. Others had gathered ahead of him, along the sidewalks, and still
  he made out that every man of the lot was heavily armed!</p>

  <p>It was stranger than a dream. If he had ridden into a bandit city where
  every man was wanted by the law, he might have expected some such greeting as
  this, but he could not be prepared for it among the law-abiding.</p>

  <p>Then, as though at a signal given, the men ahead of him poured out into
  the street and entirely blocked his way.</p>

  <p>Parade stopped, unbidden, and lifted his magnificent head. Silver, without
  glancing back, felt the pressing forward of the crowd at his rear. There were
  at least three hundred men, all armed, now ahead of him or behind him. The
  silence was deadly. Other men were coming in the distance, on the run. And
  now, as he sat in the saddle, he found the crowd edging closer, becoming more
  compact. He would have been worse than a blind man if he had not known that
  they meant trouble for him.</p>

  <p>"Well, boys, what's in the air?" he said calmly.</p>

  <p>There was no response to this, for an instant. Then an old, leaning fellow
  with a trapper's fur cap on his head, and a double-barreled shotgun in his
  hands, stepped out a little in advance of his fellows and said, in a drawling
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Jim, I dunno what to make of you. I always been told that you was right
  bright. You was bright enough to pull the wool over the eyes of everybody for
  a long spell. But d'you really think that we're such doggone fools that we'd
  let you come back to town now and bluff us out after you been and robbed the
  bank?"</p>

  <p>And another voice, far back in the crowd, yelled out suddenly: "Silver,
  ain't you been seen ridin' out of Crow's Nest with your partner,
  Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Silver looked them over with a grim thrill of understanding. All was
  reasonably clear to him now. These people had all been robbed! And the blame
  was thrown on him! Whoever it was that had worn his name must have been made
  up marvelously well in his likeness. He had come down here to prevent a great
  fraud from being practiced. It seemed that he had only arrived in time to be
  punished for the crime of another man.</p>

  <p>He was not frightened, simply because fear did not know the way into his
  great heart, but he was shocked and awed by a thing that he had never
  encountered before in all the days of his life&mdash;the seasoned and grim
  hatred of law-abiding men.</p>

  <p>He had heard it said, more than once, that no crowd of thugs is ever half
  so unreasoning, so ferocious, as a throng of the honest citizens, because the
  mere consciousness of honesty is apt to make the members of the crowd feel
  that every emotion in the heart is justifiable and should be followed with
  safety. These fellows before him had seemed at first merely antagonistic. Now
  he saw that they meant murder or its equivalent.</p>

  <p>"Friends," he said, "this is a cheat that has been worked on you. Some man
  has been here in my name, but I swear that this is the first time that either
  I or Parade have been on the streets of your town. I've never been in Crow's
  Nest before!"</p>

  <p>A loud yell of incredulity and rage answered him.</p>

  <p>"Partner," said the old trapper, "can I believe that you're goin' to try
  to tell us that the Jim Silver who was here before was just a kind of a
  shadder of you? That he was made up like a play actor to look like you? Is
  that what I gotta listen to? Jim, I'm an old man to listen to that&mdash;and
  when you robbed that bank so doggone clean, you took fifteen hundred dollars
  of money that it cost me twenty years to save! That was the money to bury me,
  and now I'm goin' to have it back from you, or else I'm goin' to have that
  much of your hide!"</p>

  <p>This was a long speech, but perhaps it was needed for the sake of rousing
  the crowd to a fever heat. The anger and the desire to act had been there
  before in every heart. There was hardly a man in the lot that had not been
  robbed in the looting of the bank. These were men accustomed to the face of
  action and ready for it now.</p>

  <p>Still the tremendous reputation of this man overawed and held them back
  with the recollection of the thousands of deeds of heroism with which he had
  ennobled his own name and the whole West. They could not lift a hand against
  the greatness of his fame, no matter how much their pocketbooks had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>Then came the speech of the old trapper who, starting calmly, had built up
  to a shouting climax in which he shook his shotgun at the head of Silver.</p>

  <p>One man cried: "But that don't look to me like the gent that's been around
  town here claiming to be Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>There was a yell of rage at the mere suggestion. Two or three of the
  crowd&mdash;neighbors of that unfortunate speaker&mdash;picked him up and
  hoisted him on their shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Here's a fool that says it ain't the same as the other Jim Silver!"
  called one.</p>

  <p>"Boys!" screamed the unlucky fellow. "I swear that don't look to me the
  same as the other chestnut, either. It's bigger and more to it,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was dropped to his feet, a hard fist knocked him fiat, and the crowd
  trampled over his body as it pressed in on Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>If they would do that much to a man who merely dared to lift his voice in
  defense of what honest eyes saw, what would they do to a man against whom
  they really had a murderous grudge? Jim Silver saw the workings of their
  fingers, and it seemed to him that his flesh was already under their hands.
  It seemed to him that he was already being torn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; WILBUR'S DECLARATION</h2>

  <p class="first">There was another man in that town who had been torn, though
  not by physical hands, a little earlier in the morning. That was Henry
  Wilbur, who sat, not in his ransacked bank, where the work of his life had
  been swept away, but in his house.</p>

  <p>He had gone down to the bank and had written in chalk with his own hand
  across the front door:</p>

  <p>I shall sell all my personal property and apply the proceeds to the
  payment of the losses incurred by the robbery of this bank. Every depositor
  shall receive something on every dollar of his deposits.</p>

  <p>(Signed) HENRY WILBUR</p>

  <p>Even that gallant declaration had not brought a single cheer from the
  crowd which watched him. They looked on him, rather, with hostile eyes. They
  began to remember ugly tales that they had heard about bankers in other days.
  Perhaps men are fools if they intrust their money to banks, they thought, and
  a hole in the ground would be a better place.</p>

  <p>With mute hostility, then, they had stared after poor Wilbur as he walked
  with a high head through the crowd and climbed the hill to his house. He kept
  a bright face. He was trying to strip away from his mind the dreadful sense
  of loss. He was trying to say to himself that every blow may be endured.</p>

  <p>When he went into the house, he was met by his wife and daughter. He took
  the hands of his wife and said to her:</p>

  <p>"Molly, it's true. I'm sorry to tell you that every penny has been cleaned
  out of the bank safe. There's not a nickel left except a few bonds that are
  not negotiable. Not enough to count. Not enough to make a penny on the
  dollar."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wilbur was as small, as withered, as dry, as her husband was large
  and robust. She made a gesture with one lean, bloodless hand, as though to
  put away the facts that had just been spoken, and, peering into the face of
  her husband, she asked:</p>

  <p>"Henry, you're not making up your mind to do any foolish thing, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder and smiled down at her.</p>

  <p>"That depends on what you call foolish," he said.</p>

  <p>She stood back from him, as though she wanted a little distance to see
  more clearly both his face and the dreadful thought that had come into her
  mind. For she knew him very well indeed, and all the workings of that brave
  and gentle heart of his. Her voice came out chokingly:</p>

  <p>"Henry, you've lost more than anyone else. You're not going to throw away
  your personal holdings to pay a part of the losses?"</p>

  <p>Then, without waiting for the answer, she demanded: "How much was taken
  away?"</p>

  <p>He looked at his daughter, and she nodded. She was pale, but steady as a
  rock. He had always guessed and hoped that she was chiefly his child. Now he
  knew it.</p>

  <p>She said: "Mother, we'd better not trouble Father now. There's nothing to
  do except the right thing, and he knows better what that is than we do."</p>

  <p>"I want to know!" exclaimed the wife. "Henry Wilbur, how much was taken
  from the bank vault?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and then he said:
  "Over&mdash;four&mdash;hundred&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the weight of the words inclined his head a little. A wild
  screech came out of the throat of his wife.</p>

  <p>"Henry, Henry!" she screamed at him. "You're not going to throw away
  everything to pay a part of that? You're not going to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mother!" said the girl. "We have to leave him alone. We have to. There's
  only one thing to do, and he knows what that should be."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wilbur's head dropped on her shoulder. She was almost fainting, and
  between them, her husband and her daughter got her stretched on her bed.
  There Ruth Wilbur worked over her until she had recovered enough to break
  into wild sobbing.</p>

  <p>"He'll give it all away!" mourned Mrs. Wilbur. "We'll die in paupers'
  graves. Oh, what have we done to deserve it? What have we done to deserve
  this? Ruth, child, darling, he loves you more than the rest of the world. Go
  and fall on your knees. Beg him not to ruin us. Remind him that he owes
  something to your future. He'll turn us out on the streets. He'll sell the
  house from over our heads. Go to him! Go to him!"</p>

  <p>The girl went&mdash;not to fall on her knees and beg, however.</p>

  <p>She found him in the library, dictating to his stenographer. He was, in
  fact, drawing up a list of his personal assets. As for his properties in
  mines and timbers, he knew that well enough. The more personal items,
  however, required thought, and he was giving his attention to them as the
  girl entered, softly, unobserved.</p>

  <p>Harry Craig, Wilbur's secretary, was drawing up the list as his chief
  dictated. It was typical of Henry Wilbur that he should have chosen a man
  like Craig to be his secretary, loading him with favors, nursing his
  investments, making him wealthy enough to be independent.</p>

  <p>Harry Craig had been born into the world with a twisted body and a
  half-paralyzed left side. He was so ugly that people could not endure his
  presence, and, therefore, his mind became as twisted as his body, until Henry
  Wilbur, out of great pity in his heart, took Craig in hand and gradually
  untwisted the tangles of his dark and bitter soul. To Craig, Wilbur was more
  than a man. He was a religion. For Craig, there was Henry Wilbur, and behind
  him, far away, unimportant, there was the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>Now he sat crookedly in his chair, resting his deformed, gloved left hand
  on the edge of the paper on which he was writing. He peered aslant at what he
  wrote and seemed to take no interest in anything except the beauty of the
  letters which he was forming.</p>

  <p>As for Henry Wilbur, he kept his head up and his eye calm, but his heart
  was dying in him, and his daughter knew it. She knew everything about him.
  She always had, from the time she was a small thing. She stood there by the
  door, silent, unobserved, and watched her father in his torment. Tears began
  to run down her face, not because she was sad about him, but because she felt
  he was so glorious.</p>

  <p>He was saying: "That brings us to the bank building and the ground it
  stands on. It has some value. It's in a good position, and when a new bank is
  set up in Crow's Nest, probably the new concern won't be able to do better
  than take over the old building. We can put down the value as twenty-five
  thousand dollars, I think. Next, there's this house and the land on which it
  stands."</p>

  <p>"This house?" said Craig, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this house," answered Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"Your home?" asked Craig, jerking his head so that he could peer into the
  face of the banker.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my home. It has to go. Everything has to go," said Wilbur.</p>

  <p>The girl took in her breath slowly. She had guessed it; her mother, even,
  had guessed it. Everything was to go in order to redeem the losses which had
  fallen upon the depositors of the town. The tears stopped running down her
  face, because she was supremely glad that there was one such man in the
  world. Her color changed. Her eyes brightened. She began to shine with beauty
  of the sort that time cannot corrupt in the eyes nor rub out of the face.</p>

  <p>"The house," said Wilbur, "ought to bring in about fifteen thousand
  dollars. It cost a good deal more than that to build, but this blow is apt to
  flatten things out in Crow's Nest, for the time being. Prices will be low.
  Say another five thousand for the land we've built on. That makes twenty
  thousand. Then there are the furnishings."</p>

  <p>"The furniture, Mr. Wilbur?" said Craig.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wilbur. "Furniture doesn't bring in much, but some of the rugs
  have a more or less stable value. Then there are the books."</p>

  <p>Wilbur ran his eyes over the lines of books which filled the wall spaces
  in the room. His happy times of rest had been spent in that room. It was the
  Mecca of his life to which he retired to be with his higher self. Books had
  always been his care and affection. He could name every book on these shelves
  by its size and position. He knew this room as he knew the palm of his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Altogether, furniture and books and all, put down ten thousand dollars. I
  hope we'll be able to get more, but in forced sales, one never knows. Now
  what does that bring the total to?"</p>

  <p>"There are some other things that could be added," said Craig, in a hard,
  rasping voice.</p>

  <p>"Such as what?" asked Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"Your wife's jewelry. And your daughter's."</p>

  <p>"My wife&mdash;may be persuaded," said Wilbur, "but for the time being it
  will be best not to list her personal possessions. Of course, whatever Ruth
  has will be sold along with my own things."</p>

  <p>He spoke with perfect confidence, and suddenly, as she listened, she felt
  that she was rewarded and repaid beforehand for any pain that life could give
  her in all the years to come. She had his utter faith, and nothing else was
  of importance.</p>

  <p>As her father spoke her name, he turned his head suddenly, and saw her.
  The sight of her got him quickly out of his chair. Craig turned about and
  made an odd, gurgling sound in the hollow of his throat.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, my dear," said Henry Wilbur. "Everything has to go. Your
  things and my things. It would mean a continual shame to me if every effort
  were not made to pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had begun to come toward her with a rather fumbling, uncertain step.
  She met him before he could go far, and measured him with her outstretched
  hands just the right distance so that she could look squarely into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you did anything else," she said, "I'd be ashamed of you. If you
  weren't going to throw everything away for the sake of your good name, I'd be
  ashamed."</p>

  <p>He had been very flushed as he approached her; now he grew pale with a
  sudden access of emotion of another sort.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear, Craig?" he said. "Do you hear? One person understands
  and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made a vague, pawing gesture with one hand, bent to the side, and then
  sprawled on the floor.</p>

  <p>Ruth dropped on her knees, grabbed his vest, and ripped it open. The
  buttons came crackling off. She put her ear over his heart. He was fat. There
  was a muffling layer of flesh between his heart and her ear. She could hear
  nothing&mdash;he was dead! No, then she got it, a subdued, hesitant
  fluttering, guessed at rather than known.</p>

  <p>Craig threw himself at his master. He grabbed at the girl with his sound
  hand and with his useless, gloved claw.</p>

  <p>"You've killed him!" he screamed at her. "You've murdered him! Get away
  from him!" Ruth jumped up, saying:</p>

  <p>"Open the window. Throw water on him. Fan his face. I'm getting the
  doctor!"</p>

  <p>She was already running for the door as she spoke the last words.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; A WOMAN'S POWER</h2>

  <p class="first">In the next room she saw her mother. Mrs. Wilbur had got up
  from her bed when she heard the scream of Craig. Now, with her false hair
  spilling in one direction and her real hair falling in another, with her
  dress loosened at the throat and her eyes staring, she came tottering toward
  her daughter, holding out her hands. And she looked to Ruth Wilbur like the
  living picture of the ruined fortunes of the house.</p>

  <p>"What's happened, Ruth?" she cried.</p>

  <p>The girl tried to dodge. One wonderfully strong hand caught her and
  attached itself to her. She twisted about silently and struck the hand away.
  Then she ran on from the house and down the steps.</p>

  <p>From the main street came an uproar of voices. A thousand people seemed to
  be shouting one phrase, but they were out of rhythm with one another, and,
  therefore, it was simply a great obscurity of formless sound that she
  heard.</p>

  <p>She was on the back of a mustang which was tethered at the hitch rack in
  front of the house. There was always a horse ready there, day and night. It
  was a rule that her father had made, and perhaps it would be the saving of
  his life, now.</p>

  <p>She sent that mustang hurtling down the long slope of the driveway toward
  the street. She had time to remember that she was not wearing a divided skirt
  and, therefore, her appearance was not modest; it was such that her mother
  would almost prefer death to such an exhibition. She was able to think of
  that, and smile vaguely at it.</p>

  <p>Then the mustang began to pitch. It was full of kinks, and she laid the
  quirt into the mean little beast savagely. In half a dozen strokes it felt
  the pain of the whiplash more than the ugliness of its own temper, and it had
  straightened out to a dead run as the girl shot out through the gateway into
  the street.</p>

  <p>The air was filled with a filmy cloud of dust that thickened, two blocks
  away, into a heavy white mist. There were hundreds of people in the street,
  packing in closer and closer, like iron filings over a magnet. And the center
  of attraction was a tall man on a great chestnut horse. She knew it was a
  stallion by the forelock and the arch of the neck like the bending of a
  mighty bow.</p>

  <p>Hands were being raised against the rider by men farther back in the
  crowd. Those in front were threatening, also. They were about to drag that
  man from his horse and kill him, and she knew it.</p>

  <p>But that didn't matter. What did matter was that the doctor's house was
  straight down this street, and there was no other way of getting to it. Not
  unless she turned back and rode clear around the bridge that arched across
  the gulch and so, by tortuous way, up to the doctor's house from the other
  side.</p>

  <p>However, there was no time for that. Her father lay dying on the carpet of
  the library. Perhaps he was dead already. She had to get through that crowd.
  If they had to kill that man&mdash;well, she hoped they would kill him now so
  that she could ride through as they scattered.</p>

  <p>She would try the outskirts, and try to press through across the
  sidewalk.</p>

  <p>She turned in. The frightened mustang began to pitch and squeal with fear.
  It helped to clear a path before them with its antics. Men cursed and dodged
  out of the way.</p>

  <p>She saw that she was going to win through, and the instant that she was
  sure of that, her mind cleared so that she was able to hear the words that
  the crowd shouted. Every man had a different phrase of hatred and contempt,
  but all of them were shouting about Jim Silver. They were saying that they
  would show him that he could not bluff the entire town of Crow's Nest. They
  would show him the justice of the greatest jurist in the world&mdash;Judge
  Lynch. One man was waving a rope over his head, yelling that he had the hemp
  that would break the neck of crooked Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>It was Jim Silver. That was the chestnut stallion, and there was the man
  who had robbed her father's bank&mdash;the man whose indirect hand had
  stretched Henry Wilbur on the floor, perhaps dying.</p>

  <p>She hoped they would tear Jim Silver to pieces! There was no feminine
  mercy or pity, no tenderness or horror in her. Her body was as tough and
  strong as the body of a boy. She had done her share of hunting big game, too,
  and her mind was as grim and stern as the mind of a man when she was
  roused.</p>

  <p>She was roused now, and, staring across the heads of the crowd, through
  the mist of the dust, she hated the rider with all her heart. It was as she
  stared that the sudden realization came to her that this was not the face of
  the man who had leaned above her in her father's garden and taken her in his
  arms and kissed her. There was no beast in this man. He was calmly waiting at
  the hands of that crowd for the thing that could not be avoided. That other
  fellow would not have been able to endure. He would have had his guns out, by
  this time, shooting, killing before he was killed. Or else he would be
  screeching out appeals. But this man was simply waiting.</p>

  <p>She looked again and was sure. There was a resemblance between that other
  Jim Silver and this one. A mere resemblance, and that was all. But the crowd
  was seeing what it wanted to see. It wanted to have the bank robber in its
  hands and it was determined that this was the man.</p>

  <p>Ruth cried out: "It's not the man you want! You're wrong! He's not the
  man!"</p>

  <p>But her voice was piping and thin in her own ears, against the growing
  roar of the crowd. For the tumult was gathering head and rising in crescendo.
  Action would follow very quickly.</p>

  <p>She looked wildly about her. A gap had opened. She could break through and
  get to the doctor and bring him back on the run to her father's house. But
  still she could not leave this place until she had struck one blow for that
  big, brown-faced fellow who was so calmly waiting for death.</p>

  <p>It was the real Jim Silver. She knew that. Truth, when it strikes the
  heart, rings it like a bell. It was the real Parade on which he sat. There
  was something more beautiful, more massive, more wildly free about the head
  of the famous horse. This was the real hero, and the robber was a
  pretender.</p>

  <p>Then she saw the sheriff.</p>

  <p>Sheriff Dick Williams was doing his best to break into the crowd. He was
  taking men by the shoulders and trying to draw them back. He could not
  succeed. Only now and again he pried two men apart and pressed between them,
  yelling that he represented the law, that he must make that rider his
  prisoner. Fists were suddenly raised, but no man dared to strike the
  representative of the law. The hands remained poised an instant until he was
  recognized, and then they dropped down again. But he could not make real
  headway through the mass of the throng. He would only spur them on more
  quickly to the murder.</p>

  <p>The hat of Dick Williams flew off. Ruth Wilbur jammed the mustang straight
  at his gray, tousled head.</p>

  <p>Men turned and yelled savagely at her. She pressed straight ahead. She got
  the frothing muzzle of the horse at the shoulder of Williams. She leaned
  forward and screamed at his ear:</p>

  <p>"Get up here! We'll ride through!"</p>

  <p>He turned a bewildered face toward her.</p>

  <p>"That isn't the bank robber! That's not the man who worked in the bank!"
  she screeched.</p>

  <p>The sheriff shouted an astonished rejoinder. She could not make out the
  words in the increasing roar of the many voices. For the time for action had
  come at last, and the men around Silver were reaching up their hands,
  grabbing at him.</p>

  <p>Dick Williams swung up in the stirrup which she abandoned to him.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the saddle! Let me ride through!" he shouted in her ear.</p>

  <p>"You need a woman. A man can't do anything!" she answered, and she drove
  the spurs remorselessly deep into the flanks of her horse.</p>

  <p>The mustang plunged ahead. Its shoulders hurled the press aside. A man
  went down, crying out in terror. It seemed to the girl that the horse
  trampled straight over the fallen body. She spurred again and again. She
  worked the rowels into the sides of the mustang. It reared and struck out.
  From those iron-shod hoofs, men shrank away. They yelled curses at her. Hands
  grabbed at her to pluck her from the saddle. She felt her dress ripping, here
  and there. The man who was swinging the rope aimed the noose at her. She
  ducked. The rope knocked her hair out of its coil and sent it down in a
  bright flood.</p>

  <p>But now she was in the midst of the dust cloud and the shouting and close
  to Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>It was like being in the middle of a stampede. They were not humans. They
  were animals, packed close together and hot for murder. She cut at them with
  her quirt. They twitched their faces around&mdash;blind, distorted
  faces&mdash;and saw the man of the law and the desperate girl. They gave
  back.</p>

  <p>She was perfectly right. No man could have done such a thing with that
  crowd, but a woman was different. There is a certain point west of the
  Mississippi where a woman becomes different, where something sacred begins to
  attach to femininity, and that swirling knot of men parted and fell back from
  Silver, as the girl came up.</p>

  <p>She stood up in the stirrups and shouted:</p>

  <p>"This isn't the man! This isn't the man who robbed the bank! This isn't
  the man!"</p>

  <p>They couldn't hear her. The men in front were pausing for the instant.
  Those behind were driving forward, yelling like thunder. Words would mean
  nothing to them. Ruth pressed her mustang beside the towering stallion. She
  threw her arm around Jim Silver and still, with her quirt, slashed at the men
  who were too close.</p>

  <p>The sheriff climbed into the saddle behind Silver. He snapped a pair of
  handcuffs over the wrists of an unresisting prisoner. Then he forced the
  hands into the air so that the steel could be seen holding the hands of Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>That might make some difference to the crowd.</p>

  <p>But they forged ahead; no one understood. It seemed to that crowd that a
  woman had come to her lover in his time of danger, and the edge of their
  murder lust was turned and blunted. Besides, there was the man of the law,
  and his steel cuffs were on the robber, as they thought. They fell back from
  the angry leaping of the quirt. They opened a channel through which the
  sheriff and the girl and Jim Silver passed.</p>

  <p>They pressed across the street, turned a corner where only a scattering of
  excited men stood in the way, and then stopped in front of a low, squat
  building&mdash;the jail. The door of it opened. They sprang down from their
  horses. And that was how Jim Silver managed to reach shelter from the
  mob.</p>

  <p>The girl saw the big, swinging shoulders pass through the doorway into
  interior darkness. She saw the door close again; then she turned the mustang
  and rode hard to get the doctor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A GATHERING STORM</h2>

  <p class="first">Henry Wilbur was still stretched on the library carpet when
  Ruth got the doctor to the house. They had wound a cold towel around his
  head, put a pillow under his shoulders, and another under his feet. His eyes
  and his mouth were slightly open. He looked like a dead man, but now and then
  he could be heard to draw a breath. The breathing had a bubbling sound and
  seemed, every minute, about to stop.</p>

  <p>With the doctor there, they got Wilbur into bed. He lay in a semi-coma.
  The doctor said that he might lie that way for twenty-four hours and after
  that&mdash;well, no one could tell. The heart was weak&mdash;very
  weak&mdash;but it was not a stroke of paralysis. Overload this human soul and
  the fine steel of it may snap; that was all the doctor could say.</p>

  <p>The girl sat for hours and hours at the side of her father. Now and then
  he would say: "Sell everything." Then she would press his hand and answer:
  "Everything's all right." She tried to think of something else to say, but
  that phrase was all that she could use, and every time he heard it, the
  gathering cloud would pass out of the forehead of the sick man. His breathing
  became steadier. Late in the afternoon his eyes suddenly opened wide, and he
  knew what was happening around him.</p>

  <p>"Has everything been sold?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Everything is going to be sold," she told him.</p>

  <p>He considered the ceiling, and remarked: "I seem to have crashed."</p>

  <p>"No one could help crashing," she assured him. "Nobody could blame you for
  crashing. Don't you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "but listen to me. You're my witness. If I pass
  out&mdash;which I'm not going to do&mdash;but if I pass out, I want
  everything sold to help pay back the investors. Listen to me&mdash;if
  everything is sold, I can pay them eighty-five cents on the dollar. Don't let
  your mother talk you out of the truth. Eighty-five cents on the dollar. I
  made that money and I also made a good name. A good name is a lot better than
  money. I want to spend the money to save the name. I'm selfish. You and your
  mother may starve&mdash;but your name will be clean. I don't have to tell you
  this because you already know it! This is my last will and testament. Now,
  try to get the lawyer, and I'll get that will into writing."</p>

  <p>She got the lawyer. Then she went in and sat beside her mother for a time.
  The little gray-haired woman lay in a darkened room, moaning softly, and
  weeping continually.</p>

  <p>"It's ruin!" she kept saying, over and over. "It's ruin, ruin, ruin! He's
  going to turn us out into the street. I'll fight. It's not legal. He's not in
  his right mind! Oh, Ruth, my poor darling!"</p>

  <p>The girl went back into the library, and sat there alone, trying to
  think.</p>

  <p>Craig came hobbling in, bringing a letter.</p>

  <p>He said, as he gave it to her: "I lost my head when your father fainted. I
  said some things to you. I'm sorry about that."</p>

  <p>"Don't be sorry," said the girl. "I like you better, because you said
  those things."</p>

  <p>Craig shook his head. He hesitated, trying to get out the words that stuck
  in his throat.</p>

  <p>"You're the only one that matters to him," he said sharply, and turned
  about and went hastily out of the room.</p>

  <p>It was a very strange thing, she thought, that she should be able to pity
  Craig, that she should be able to spare that much thought to anyone other
  than her father, and to the real Jim Silver, who was safely lodged in the
  jail.</p>

  <p>She opened the letter, and it was from Silver. It ran:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MISS WILBUR:<br>
  <br>
  No one can tell how things will turn out. In any case, I want you to have a
  few words from me before the finish, whatever it may be. I want to tell you,
  above all, that you did what nobody else in the world could have done.<br>
  <br>
  The sheriff tells me that you were on your way to get the doctor for your
  father, who was close to death. But that hardly makes what you did for me any
  more wonderful.<br>
  <br>
  I've never known a man who was the pure steel all the way to the heart, but I
  can say, now, that I've known one such woman.<br>
  <br>
  They were going to kill me with their bare hands. They were going to smash me
  up. It would have started in a few seconds. Nothing but a woman could have
  stopped them. And no woman but you would even have tried.<br>
  <br>
  I have to keep remembering that I'm a stranger to you. It was perfect before,
  but that makes it more perfect.<br>
  <br>
  Yours,<br>
  <br>
  JIM SILVER</p>

  <p>She began to smile at the letter, the swiftly running, small writing. One
  thing in the letter was untrue entirely. They were not strangers.</p>

  <p>She went out and found Craig.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you about Jim Silver," she said. "Why is he still in
  the jail?"</p>

  <p>"Because he can't get out," said Craig.</p>

  <p>"Can't get out? Why not?"</p>

  <p>Craig began to breathe hard.</p>

  <p>"You want him free?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"The scoundrel that ruined your father?" shouted Craig. "You want him
  free?"</p>

  <p>"Hush," said the girl. "Father will hear you."</p>

  <p>"I hope he does!" said Craig. "I hope he finds out, before he dies, that
  his girl loves a bank robber more than she loves her father! I hope that he
  finds out the truth about you!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really think the man in jail is the robber?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Are there two Jim Silvers in this world? Are you completely out of your
  head, Ruth?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said the girl, "that the man the mob was trying to kill was
  not the man who was working for my father?"</p>

  <p>"What?" said Craig.</p>

  <p>"I've seen him. I know."</p>

  <p>"I heard some sort of nonsense to that effect," said Craig. "The whole
  town knows that there's a plot on foot to bamboozle the authorities and get
  the robber out of the hands of justice. But that plot is going to be baffled,
  even if some wise young women like Ruth Wilbur have been convinced. The
  townspeople have not been convinced, and the sheriff has not been convinced,
  either. You can be sure of that because I've seen and talked with him."</p>

  <p>"You mean that Dick Williams really thinks that he has the right man there
  in jail?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Ruth, Ruth," said the cripple, easily exasperated, "anyone but a woman,
  and a silly woman at that, would realize that of course we have the right man
  down there in the jail. And the sheriff will keep him there. At least
  Williams will manage to keep him there until the mob tears down the building
  and takes the rascal away."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the mob will attack the jail?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Will they? I don't know. They ought to, certainly. They've heard
  something about this same nonsense that has reached your ears, and they are
  not going to be put off by a ridiculous story of double identity. The people
  in this town are pretty much worked up, young lady. They know, now, that your
  father intends to give up his fortune to pay most of the losses of the
  robbery. They know, besides, that your father is at the point of death, and
  that's why they want Jim Silver&mdash;not for robbery only, but for murder.
  And they're right."</p>

  <p>He was just finishing this tirade when word was brought to the girl that a
  man wanted to see her.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your father," said the bitter cripple. "I'll go and see the
  man, whoever he is. It's probably another one of the rascals who've been
  talking nonsense to you."</p>

  <p>He went hobbling away to the front door where, outside the screen, he saw
  a dapper youth in his early twenties, wearing a very neat blue suit with a
  white flower in his buttonhole. He had on a pair of good chamois gloves that
  folded down over the backs of his hands, and he was resting one of these
  hands on a very slender and supple walking stick. He seemed to have walked
  over the street on winged feet, for there was not a sign of dust on his
  well-polished shoes. His gray felt hat was tucked jauntily under his arm; and
  what offended the savage little cripple more than all else was the flawless
  part and the glossy sleekness of the black hair of this man, who said:</p>

  <p>"I believe this is the house of Henry Wilbur, the banker?"</p>

  <p>"Do you?" said Craig, openly snarling.</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the stranger, "will you be good enough to ask Miss
  Wilbur if I may have the pleasure of speaking with her for a few
  minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I will not be good enough, and you won't have the pleasure," answered
  Craig.</p>

  <p>The man on the porch suddenly lifted the thick black veil of his lashes
  and gave Craig a glimpse of eyes strangely pale and bright. If this fellow
  was a dandy, he was something more, in addition. Craig was sure of it after
  one flash of those eyes. Suddenly he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Her pa's sick," said Craig. "Her pa's very sick, and she's gotta take
  care of him."</p>

  <p>"I know her father is ill," said the stranger. "That's why I only ask a
  few seconds of her time, if you think that she can see me."</p>

  <p>Craig hesitated, growling. Then he said that he would see, and went off to
  Ruth Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"There's a smart young fashion plate at the front door," he said. "Maybe
  you'd like to go and smile at him, eh? I guess he'd be ready to smile
  back!"</p>

  <p>Ruth went to the door and found the dapper young man still waiting. His
  hat he tucked under his arm again, and he bowed at the sight of her. She
  pushed open, the screen door and told him to come in. He passed by her with
  an alert step so soundless that it startled her. He was not wearing rubber
  heels, either, for no dusty mark was left on the surface of the floor paint.
  He stood in the hall, bowing to her again. He had the supple grace of a
  fencer.</p>

  <p>"Miss Wilbur," he said, "I've come to tell you that I'm a friend of the
  real Jim Silver, and I've learned what you did for him today. When I say that
  I'm a friend of Silver's, I mean that I'm a man whose life he has saved as
  surely as you saved his today. He's not out of trouble yet, but if he has a
  ghost of a chance, it's because you fought for him.</p>

  <p>"I've come here to thank you. I'm not the only one. When the people know
  the whole truth, there are plenty of other friends of Silver scattered all
  through the mountains, and they'll all be ready to die for you. I've come to
  tell you, as the first of the lot, that if there's ever a thing that you need
  or if you're ever in trouble, I'll hear you whistle from the ends of the
  earth and come to help. My real name doesn't matter. People usually call me
  Taxi."</p>

  <p>She thought it was a strange and simple speech, and it was given point by
  his name. She knew about Taxi, too. It surprised her to see that he was so
  young, because his was one of the great names in the legend of Jim Silver.
  And though Silver himself was not more than between twenty-eight and
  thirty-five, she never thought of him except as a hero gray with time. Taxi
  was the man, it was said, in whom Silver had more implicit faith than in any
  other person in the world.</p>

  <p>She broke out: "I've heard that there's danger to him, now, from the town
  mob! What's to be done about it, Taxi? I don't need thanks for what I've
  done. The whole world owes somehing to the real Jim Silver. But tell me if
  it's possible that the crowd may smash the jail?"</p>

  <p>Taxi looked no higher than her hands. It was his habit, when he was
  talking with a person, unless that person was Jim Silver. He said:</p>

  <p>"They've built a battering-ram that ought to be strong enough to beat in
  the doors of the jail. The town's full. People have come in from the whole
  countryside. The Easterners who have been taking the cure up in the hotel at
  the springs have rented window space overlooking the jail. Everybody seems to
  know for sure that there'll be a lynching party tonight."</p>

  <p>"We've got to mix with the crowd and explain that it is not the robber
  that's now in the jail," said the girl. "We've got to explain to the sheriff,
  first of all."</p>

  <p>"I've mixed with the crowd already," said Taxi, "and tried to make some
  suggestions like that, and I had to dodge a few punches and get away from a
  gun play. The people in this town are pretty much worked up, and they're not
  soothed by knowing that your father is a very sick man. They attribute that
  to Jim Silver, too, and they feel that they're in honor bound to make an end
  of the man in jail. Nothing can influence 'em. They're only waiting for
  night."</p>

  <p>"Can we do nothing?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to try," said Taxi, "but my hand has to be played alone."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; TAXI'S LONE HAND</h2>

  <p class="first">Taxi walked up to the top of a hill that overlooked the town
  of Crow's Nest. He sat down on a rock and took out of his clothes the various
  parts of a little spyglass and screwed them together. It was small, like most
  of the tools that Taxi employed, but it had as fine a lens as money could
  buy.</p>

  <p>First, he scanned the town with his naked eye, and glanced out of the
  wooded hollow that contained Crow's Nest to the profound depths of the valley
  beyond, now misting over with the shadows of the evening, like a slowly
  rising tide of thin water.</p>

  <p>The glass changed all of this. He could penetrate the mists of the valley
  and see the sheen of the river that ran through the bottom lands, a bright,
  golden sheen as the sun walked farther down the bow of heaven toward the
  west. In the town itself he could pick out figures walking the streets, and
  presently he caught the jail itself in clear focus.</p>

  <p>It was set in the midst of an open stretch. No other building was within
  half a block of it, and that was why he was able to see the cordon which had
  been drawn around the prison by the townsmen. There seemed to be three or
  four hundred already on the job. Traffic had been blocked. It was like an
  established battle line.</p>

  <p>When he was sure of the setting, he examined the building itself. When the
  rest of the ground had been cleared, the builders had remembered the fierce
  heat of the summer, and they had allowed several big trees to stand close to
  the jail. The shadows of these, from the west, poured across the roof of the
  building, and it was only after much searching that he was able to detect the
  presence of the skylight. It was small, and it was hardly raised at all above
  the surface of the roof.</p>

  <p>When Taxi was sure of that, he spent a few more minutes studying the
  windows of the jail as they appeared from this side, and the big door. Then
  he unscrewed the assembled spyglass and put it away in his clothes. The lens
  fitted into a velvet-lined, small pocket on the inside of his belt. He stood
  up, dusted his clothes with care, and then walked slowly down to the
  town.</p>

  <p>He went into a restaurant, got a corner table, and ate a light meal. By
  the time he had finished, it was almost completely dark. He saw the big Negro
  dishwasher throw off his wet apron, grab a hat, and hurry out of the place.
  The cook followed. There was only the waiter remaining, and he seemed
  discontented to be left behind.</p>

  <p>Taxi did not need to be told where the other pair were going. He left in
  his turn. He passed the local general merchandise store, which was kept open
  until eight o'clock for the convenience of such late shoppers as ranchers and
  lumberjacks. In that store he bought a length of rope and walked out with his
  purchase. In the first vacant lot he hid himself in a nest of shrubbery,
  pulled off his coat, and wound the rope around and around his body. Then he
  went on.</p>

  <p>The next problem was to pass the cordon that was stretched around the
  jail. No one was allowed to go through, and a number of lanterns had been
  supplied, and, carrying them, men were constantly walking up and down the
  line. That was what gave Taxi his idea.</p>

  <p>He found the source of the lantern supply at one corner of the cordon,
  where they were being filled and passed out. He saw a big fellow with a face
  made grim by a saber-shaped mustache, who seemed to be in charge of the
  lanterns. But without asking permission, Taxi filled one from the five-gallon
  kerosene can, trimmed the wick, and lighted it. Then he went off down the
  back of the crowded line of the cordon.</p>

  <p>No one paid any attention to him until he turned through the line and
  walked straight across the open ground toward the jail. Instantly voices
  hailed him, then.</p>

  <p>"Who's that? Who's going there?"</p>

  <p>Taxi turned around without haste.</p>

  <p>"D'you think I'm going for fun?" he asked.</p>

  <p>At that remark someone laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>"You fool," said another, "d'you think he'd be carrying a light to show
  himself if he was sneaking for the jail on any business except ours?"</p>

  <p>That was apparently in answer to some suspicious suggestion. Taxi walked
  straight on, slowly, and more slowly, taking his leaping nerves in hand and
  forcing them to be quiet.</p>

  <p>When he was very close to the jail, he simply turned down the wick, and
  with one jouncing movement of the lantern caused the flame to sicken and
  die.</p>

  <p>The darkness that followed would hide him from the observation of the men
  of the cordon.</p>

  <p>He turned down the side of the building until he came to the big trees at
  the western end of it. A spruce was the one he wanted, a grand fellow with
  wide, shaggy arms. He went up the trunk of that tree like a monkey. A wind
  was rising. The noise of it in the tree he climbed was like the rushing sound
  of the sea on a beach, and its noise in the neighboring trees was like the
  noise of distant beaches.</p>

  <p>When he gained the top of the tree, he was well above the level of the
  roof of the jail. He could mark the dim outline of the skylight that
  projected a little above the roof line. It had seemed close to the trees,
  when he was looking down from the top of the hill. Now it seemed far
  away.</p>

  <p>He took the rope, built a small noose in it, and suddenly wished for the
  skill that was possessed by ten thousand cowpunchers on the range. But that
  skill was not his, and he knew from experience of old what he would have to
  use as a substitute&mdash;patience.</p>

  <p>That was what sustained him as, time and again, he made the cast from the
  treetop, and once in five times the noose would fall true over the little
  skylight, but every time, no matter how carefully he drew the rope taut, the
  noose slipped over the projection of the skylight, and his bag was
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>Then a certain change in the voice of the crowd made his heart leap. There
  was not much that his eye could see, except a greater collection of people at
  one point in the cordon, and an assembling of lanterns, there. Those lanterns
  did not flash on the pallor of shining faces; he saw that the crowd, at least
  in this section, had been masked. That meant that the ringleaders had
  appeared on the scene, that the striking force had been assembled, and that
  the assault on the jail would presently follow.</p>

  <p>Taxi climbed down the tree, found half a dozen small stones, and tied them
  to one side of the noose of the rope. Then he returned to the top of the
  tree, and made the cast. The stones fell with a distinctly audible thud on
  the roof near the skylight. How the noose had flopped he could not be sure,
  but he hoped that it had fallen down the slope of the roof, over the skylight
  and that the weight of the little stones would hold the rope flat until the
  drawn noose caught on something.</p>

  <p>Gingerly he drew in on the rope, little by little, like a fisherman most
  delicately playing a small fish. Then from beneath him and around the corner
  of the jail, he heard the pounding of a hand against the door.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Sheriff Williams! Hey, Dick!" called a voice. "I wanta talk to
  you!"</p>

  <p>Then a voice, half hollow from confinement inside the building and half
  freely issuing into the night, rejoined: "I know you, Nick, I know your
  voice. I hope that you ain't mixed up in this rotten business."</p>

  <p>"Dick," said Nick, "I'm mixed up in it, all right. We want the dirty crook
  and bank robber, Jim Silver. We want the rat who smashed the bank and killed
  Henry Wilbur, and we're goin' to have him."</p>

  <p>"Is Wilbur dead?" cried the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"He's pretty nigh to it. If he ain't dead, it ain't the fault of Jim
  Silver. Dick, don't you be a fool now."</p>

  <p>"I ain't a fool," said the sheriff. "I just got a job to do, and I'm goin'
  to do it."</p>

  <p>"Dick," urged the other, "you know me very well and you know that I don't
  go in for crooked work, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You're in a crooked deal if you try to smash this jail," said the
  sheriff, "and I'll have you in the pen for your share in it&mdash;if I live
  to talk tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"It's a thing that maybe you ain't sure to do," said Nick grimly. "I'm
  telling you, man to man, that we got this jail like a nut in a nutcracker. We
  can split it open any time we want to. The boys are spoiling for action, and
  they're going to have it."</p>

  <p>"You tell the boys," shouted the sheriff, "that if they try to rush this
  jail, I'll open up on 'em, and that I'll shoot to kill."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Then: "Dick, do you think Jim Silver is guilty?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't a fool," said the sheriff. "I know that he's as guilty as
  anything."</p>

  <p>"You know the talk they're makin' about a false Jim Silver, a counterfeit
  Jim Silver&mdash;you know that that is fool talk, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure it's fool talk," agreed the sheriff, "but that don't mean that I'm
  goin' to let you boys have what you want."</p>

  <p>"Dick, will you kill honest men to keep them from lynching a dirty,
  bank-robbing crook?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do my duty&mdash;that's certain!" shouted Dick Williams, and a
  window slammed shut.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; INSIDE THE JAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">Time was short. Oh, time was very short indeed. When Nick
  brought the sheriff's final answer back to the crowd, there might be an
  instant rush for the jail. The whole mob might break loose in a mighty
  wave.</p>

  <p>Taxi pulled in on his rope. It seemed to catch, then it slipped. He
  groaned as he made sure that it had failed once more, but then he found it
  holding again. He put his weight on the rope, and still it held, trembling
  with tautness.</p>

  <p>At last he ventured on tying it fast around the trunk of the tree and
  swinging out along the rope. The treetop instantly swayed far over. He found
  himself in the bight of the rope, hauling himself uphill toward the edge of
  the roof.</p>

  <p>Now his grip was on the eaves, and soon he was on the roof. The tree,
  springing back, released from the strain, caused the rope to snap against
  him, almost knocking him off his feet.</p>

  <p>Then he discovered that the rope was not holding by the edges of the
  skylight. It had caught on a single nail that was half buried in the edge of
  the window frame. He took one deep breath as he thought of what might have
  happened; then he fell to work on the lock of the skylight.</p>

  <p>The glass was heavy, very thick, and very strong. Nevertheless, he worked
  a glass cutter noiselessly through it, cut out a hand hole, and pulled back
  the spring lock. After that he raised the skylight and cut into the darkness
  beneath him with a few slashing strokes of his flashlight. It showed to him a
  long and empty attic room, with a low ceiling and naked rafters. There were
  some dust-covered boxes here and there. That was the only furniture.</p>

  <p>Taxi went down the rough wooden steps from the skylight to the attic
  floor. Out of the darkness of that floor he could see a single thin ray of
  light standing up like a polished rapier. He came to the hole in the floor
  and put his eye to the crack. The whole cell room lay beneath him. He was in
  the exact center of the big room, lying on top of a trap-door which opened
  down.</p>

  <p>With one hand he took off his shoes, as he stared. It was just the sort of
  a picture that he had expected. There were two blocks of the little steel
  cells, and two aisles that ran between them. In each of those aisles, armed
  with a sawed-off shotgun, a guard was striding up and down. The sheriff sat
  in a chair at the front of the room, nervously smoking a cigar. Now and again
  he jumped up and walked a few steps, peered down one or the other of the
  aisles, and returned to his chair again.</p>

  <p>After a moment he came up to the guard who slouched up and down the aisle,
  just below Taxi.</p>

  <p>"How's things, Pete?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The guard halted and swung his shotgun to the hook of his left arm. He
  settled one hand flat on the hip of the overalls which covered him.</p>

  <p>"How do I know how things are?" he asked, and then jerked the brim of his
  big slouch hat still lower over his eyes. "Things are the way the gents
  outside are goin' to make 'em," he declared.</p>

  <p>The sheriff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye on Silver," he added. "There ain't anybody else in this
  aisle to bother you. There's only Silver. Keep watching his hands and see
  that the irons are always on him. He's a tricky devil."</p>

  <p>"There ain't any trick in the world as good as the buckshot that I poured
  into this here gun and stopped up with wadding," said the guard, patting the
  double barrels of the shotgun. "I got enough in each barrel to wash a whole
  crowd off a street!" He laughed with a long, drawling, nasal intonation of
  joy in his voice.</p>

  <p>The sheriff looked him up and down curiously.</p>

  <p>"I kinda think you hope that the gang breaks in here and tries to rush
  you, Pete," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I ain't sayin' nothin', but I've shot a pile of ducks in my day,"
  remarked Pete.</p>

  <p>The smile of the sheriff was turned to a grimace by a deep, muttering
  uproar that started outside the jail and swept more and more loudly through
  the air.</p>

  <p>"They're coming!" said the sheriff. "I'm going into the office and see
  what things are like on that side. Pete, it may be guns and a fight to the
  finish, for all I know."</p>

  <p>He turned and was gone, running. Pete looked after him for a moment, and
  then slowly strode up the length of the aisle, paused to stare into the one
  cell whose door was shut, and then went gradually on.</p>

  <p>It was Taxi's moment, and he used it by opening the catch that secured the
  trap-door and letting it hang down. He himself was instantly through the
  opening, hanging from the under edge of the swinging door. Luckily the hinges
  did not creak. Then he dropped, and there was only the softest of thudding
  sounds as his stockinged feet struck the cement floor.</p>

  <p>The guard was already at the far end of the aisle, where he half turned to
  the side and said to the man who paced the next aisle:</p>

  <p>"The soup's goin' to be hot pretty soon."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, pretty hot, pretty soon," said the other guard.</p>

  <p>"Hope you don't burn your tongue on it," remarked Pete, and chuckled.</p>

  <p>Taxi, in the meantime, was gliding rapidly up the aisle, and there, to his
  left, behind the bars of the closed cell in the center of the block of cells,
  he saw Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>The big man was sitting on the edge of his cot, his legs, his arms, loaded
  with irons. As Taxi went by, the great head lifted a little. That was all.
  But Taxi saw the sheen of the eyes and the glint of light on the gray spots
  above the temples of the prisoner. Those spots looked more like horns than
  ever.</p>

  <p>Pete, finishing his conversation, started to turn back to resume his beat.
  As he turned, Taxi, leaping the last of the distance, struck with the heel of
  his gun. It was not the first time he had bludgeoned a man, and he knew the
  force required to knock a man flat without shattering the skull.</p>

  <p>He used the right force now, but, to his amazement, Pete did not fall. He
  only took one half-step back, and braced himself, the shotgun starting to
  slip out of his hands.</p>

  <p>Taxi snatched that gun away. He raised the automatic to strike with the
  heel of it again, and then he saw that the eyes of the guard were totally
  lifeless. The man was unconscious on his feet.</p>

  <p>Taxi rammed a shoulder against Pete's stomach and folded him over like a
  half-filled sack. Then, almost running, he returned to the cell of Jim
  Silver. At the same time, from the outside of the jail, the growing wave of
  uproar washed suddenly around the building.</p>

  <p>Taxi spilled the guard to the floor and thrust his picklock into the
  keyhole of the cell door. They might be very difficult, those locks. He heard
  the sheriff shouting from the front part of the jail, perhaps threatening the
  crowd. In the whirling brain of Taxi there was no chance to sort out the
  sounds and recognize the words.</p>

  <p>Now the bolt yielded, suddenly, and the door was open. He flung the guard
  inside, caught at the irons on the wrists of Silver.</p>

  <p>"It's a bad lock, Taxi," said Silver. "It'll take time to do it."</p>

  <p>Taxi stifled a groan behind the click of his teeth. If he needed time,
  there was only one way to get it. He turned to the guard, stripped the
  overalls from the limp body, and jumped into them. They covered his own
  clothes from head to foot. The boots of Pete were big and loose. He had them
  off and on his own feet instantly, jammed the slouch hat of Pete on his head,
  caught up the shotgun, and, tossing his automatic to Silver, stepped out into
  the aisle.</p>

  <p>That instant the office door was flung open, and the sheriff rushed out,
  shouting:</p>

  <p>"They've got a big battering-ram, boys! They're goin' to beat down the
  front door. I can't find it in my heart to shoot at 'em! I can't murder 'em
  because they want to hang a crook!"</p>

  <p>"Bird shot!" called the other guard. "Give 'em bird shot, Dick."</p>

  <p>"There ain't any bird shot, you fool!" cried the sheriff.</p>

  <p>The moment he was out of view, Taxi turned back into the cell. He dropped
  to his knees and began to toil at the lock of the handcuffs. Seconds counted.
  Every second might be the end of it all, and yet he could not hurry. He had
  to take hold of himself with the full grasp of his will. He had to control
  himself as though he were frozen to attention, listening to a very distant
  sound.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, he kept himself oblivious of the uproar around him.
  The battering-ram struck its first blow against the front door of the jail.
  The whole building seemed to quiver with the weight of the stroke. There was
  a sound of splintering wood.</p>

  <p>With a tenth part of his mind, Taxi heard that telltale sound and
  registered the meaning of it. Then the handcuffs sprang open!</p>

  <p>"Good work! Wonderful work! Back into the aisle for a breather," said the
  calm voice of Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>What a man was that! The calm for which Taxi had to fight with hysterical
  intentness was merely the gift of God to Jim Silver. There was not a tremor
  in his body that Taxi could feel. His hand under the manacle had been steady
  as a stone.</p>

  <p>"The leg irons another time," said Silver. "Leave me the picklock. I may
  be able to work them."</p>

  <p>Taxi gave him the picklock and stepped out into the aisle again. He was
  only the flicker of an eyelash ahead of the reappearance of the sheriff, who
  shouted to him:</p>

  <p>"This way, Pete. Help me hold 'em at the door."</p>

  <p>Taxi, turning his back, walked resolutely down the aisle. He tried to
  force the nasal drawl of Pete into his voice as he shouted in answer:</p>

  <p>"My job's here, and here's where I stay."</p>

  <p>"You stubborn fool!" yelled the sheriff. Then he turned and fired a
  revolver bullet through the upper part of the big door. There was a great
  outcry and a scrambling of feet and stamping outside, on the steps.</p>

  <p>"Keep away from that door, or I'll drill some of you!" yelled Dick.</p>

  <p>Then through the crack of the door a voice came booming, half stifled:
  "Williams, if you fire another shot, we're goin' to pull you apart and break
  your wishbone in two. Don't be a fool!"</p>

  <p>Taxi was already back in the cell with his friend, for Silver had
  abandoned the little picklock to him with a despairing shake of the head.</p>

  <p>On the floor, Pete was beginning to stir and groan softly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE MOB</h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Williams, frantic with fear and excitement, and savage
  with desire to do his duty, was yelling from the front of the jail that he
  would let a streak of light into the first man who dared to dash open the
  front door of the building, when there was a sudden heavy crash against the
  rear door of the jail. The mob had wrecked the front entrance so that a child
  could knock down the flimsy ruin that remained standing. Now it had gone
  behind the jail and was splintering the rear door. They yelled in rhythm and
  chorus as they swung the heavy timber that served them as a
  battering-ram.</p>

  <p>The sheriff, when he heard this new outbreak, began to turn around in a
  blind and helpless circle, crying out orders where there were no men to help
  him perform the work in hand.</p>

  <p>Taxi, in this moment, had made Jim Silver free. Instead of an incubus, he
  had loosed a force that would be felt far away, and before long. From the
  fallen guard, Silver took a pair of revolvers that Taxi had not searched for.
  As that unlucky Pete recovered his wits, Silver was saying to him:</p>

  <p>"Wait thirty seconds, Pete. Then you can make all the noise you want."</p>

  <p>Silver then stepped behind Taxi into the open aisle of the jail and closed
  the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Forward, Taxi saw Dick Williams shooting through the top of the front door
  of the jail.</p>

  <p>"That way!" said Taxi to his friend, and pointed toward the little
  trap-door that hung from the ceiling. How they would get through it he could
  not tell. Better brains and stronger hands than his own could struggle with
  the problem now. Silver went forward at a halting run, measured his distance,
  bounded high, and caught the trap-door with his hands. He swung like a
  pendulum through half a vibration, shifted his grip higher, and now hung from
  the edge of the attic floor. He was through the opening in a moment, and now
  he appeared, hanging down from the waist, his long arms dangling, his hands
  in the air, reaching far down.</p>

  <p>"Jump, Taxi!" he called quietly.</p>

  <p>Taxi knew that he could not reach the lower tip of the trap-door, but it
  was an easy jump for him to catch hold of the hands of Silver. The force of
  his leap swung him backward and forward, while the voice of Pete, the guard,
  went yelling through the jail:</p>

  <p>"Dick! Dick! Hi, Dick Williams! The devil's come and took Jim Silver
  away!"</p>

  <p>Dick Williams had something else to think about, for the rear door of the
  jail went down with a crash as Taxi's body disappeared through the trap in
  the ceiling, drawn strongly upward by Jim Silver's grasp.</p>

  <p>The door itself Silver closed again and left the lower floor of the jail
  to the guards who had been set to keep him for the law, and the mob which had
  come to hang him with its own hands. Silver could not help smiling a little
  when he considered how perfectly Taxi had performed the impossible and caused
  him to disappear at the crucial moment.</p>

  <p>It was a proof that Jim Silver did not need, a certainty that the
  affection of Taxi would endure while there was breath in his body.</p>

  <p>They were fumbling in the darkness toward the stairs that led up to the
  skylight. Beneath them the building roared and shook with the entrance of the
  mob. Outside of the building the angry men of the town were gathered.
  Certainly the two were far from safe, but they were together, and, therefore,
  the strength of each was multiplied; they were armed, and the terrible hands
  of Jim Silver were free.</p>

  <p>"They'll be after us as fast as they can fetch a ladder to the trap-door,"
  said Taxi. "But I've got a bridge that may snake us off the roof."</p>

  <p>"A bridge into what?" asked Silver. "Into the sky?"</p>

  <p>They came out onto the roof. Above them, the sky was closely powdered with
  the stars; below them down the sharp slant of the roof, they could see the
  whole male population of Crow's Nest swarming in to take part in the
  lynching, or to be witnesses of it. Lanterns tossed here and there, and long
  yellow splashes of light streaked across the roof. If the two men on top of
  the jail were not seen, it was only because no eyes thought of looking up
  there.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the skylight, Taxi said: "Here's the rope. Wait till I
  fasten it around the door, then swing along it to the tree, Jim. This is the
  way I got to the jail."</p>

  <p>His flying hands had already reached down into the skylight and noosed the
  rope around the door. "Go first," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"'No, no! It's you that they want. They wouldn't stretch my neck, Jim.
  You're the bird they're after."</p>

  <p>"Go first," said the calm voice of Silver.</p>

  <p>Taxi gave him one despairing glance. But he knew that there was no use
  arguing against that unruffled insistence. He slipped off the edge of the
  roof, worked down the slack of the rope to the bight of it, and began to hand
  over hand himself up the farther end to the tree.</p>

  <p>As he went, he had glimpses of the crowd below. It seemed to him that all
  the faces were turned up toward him. The black masks on them made them like
  figures in a dream, those misty countenances that never can be resolved into
  features, mere blank sketches of the imagination.</p>

  <p>One thing more he saw in the distance, in the middle of the street, and
  that was the shining picture of Parade. It was strange that he should have
  been led out, as though it were part of the cruel plan of the mob to make the
  poor horse see the death of his master. But there he stood, with his head
  high and his tail arching, looking apart from the crowd and free of it and
  above it in the perfection of his beauty.</p>

  <p>Now, in the dark of the tree, Taxi reached the trunk, looked down through
  the branches, made sure that no one had, in fact, marked his escape, and
  jerked several times on the slack of the rope to let Silver know that the way
  was open.</p>

  <p>It was high time, for the uproar in the jail was rising upward in it, a
  sure sign that a ladder had been placed already against the trap. Now and
  then a gun exploded, but it was plain that no violence had been used on Dick
  Williams or the guards. Taxi had time to be glad of that, and then he saw the
  big form of Silver come swinging across the rope, the top of the tree bending
  far over, the slack of the rope hanging down in a deep loop.</p>

  <p>A moment more and he was among the branches. He was safe for the present,
  clinging to the trunk of the spruce tree. The rope, unknotted, swung outward
  and dangled like a great snake down the side of the jail.</p>

  <p>"Masks! Masks!" called Silver. "Your coat lining, Taxi!"</p>

  <p>It was like Silver to remember every detail even in the pinch of fast
  action. Taxi ripped out a great section of lining from the back of his coat,
  thrust his thumb through it twice to make eyeholes, and put the cloth over
  his head. It made a sufficient mask, though a clumsy one. Glancing up, he saw
  that Silver had completed his preparations before him and was now
  descending.</p>

  <p>Taxi went down the trunk of the tree, hung from the lowest branch an
  instant, and then dropped to the ground. Hands were instantly gripping
  him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" shouted a voice at his ear.</p>

  <p>"Silver's on the roof of the jail!" cried Taxi. "Think I'd stay there in
  the tree till I was shot out of it like a partridge? Silver's on the roof of
  the jail!"</p>

  <p>"The roof!" yelled the men around Taxi, instantly letting him go.
  "Silver's on the roof of the jail!"</p>

  <p>They gave back, scattering this way and that, preparing their guns to fire
  at random at any target.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver himself slid down the trunk of the tree and stepped beside
  Taxi.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Silver, as they edged away through the thick of the crowd.
  "Where's your horse?"</p>

  <p>"Tied to a hitch rack a block from here."</p>

  <p>"Go get him. Which way?"</p>

  <p>"First turn to the right, next to the main street."</p>

  <p>"Go get your horse."</p>

  <p>"And what'll you do for a horse, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"They can't keep Parade," said Silver. "Not after he hears me whistle.
  He'll come through them like a wind through dead leaves. Hurry, Taxi. These
  fellows are beginning to go wild."</p>

  <p>It was true, for just now the manhunters who had climbed up through the
  attic of the jail came out on the roof and were dimly seen from the ground. A
  number of men raised their guns to shoot, until it was made out that there
  were not merely two, but a whole stream of men issuing from the skylight.
  Voices yelled back and forth from the ground to the roof. Advice was given;
  oaths went barking through the night. And then the whole body of the men who
  had first entered the jail began to swarm out of it.</p>

  <p>Taxi already had wormed his way through the crowd; now he walked rapidly
  toward the place where he had left the mustang. He could bless the mask that
  covered his face, for there were men carrying lanterns everywhere.</p>

  <p>When Taxi had reached his mustang, he was instantly in the saddle and rode
  back to the corner from which he could see the throng around the stallion.
  People were shouting from the direction of the jail:</p>

  <p>"Saddle! Saddle! Get your horses, boys. Silver's gone. Watch Parade!"</p>

  <p>There was sense in that, because every man of the lot knew that Jim Silver
  would sooner leave his right arm behind him than the great stallion.</p>

  <p>Off on the edge of the sidewalk, wrapped in a cloak and staring toward the
  jail, Taxi saw Ruth Wilbur standing quietly.</p>

  <p>Then, shrilling over the thicker, heavier noises of the crowd, Taxi heard
  the signal whistle of Jim Silver. It rang like a bugle call in the soul of
  Taxi, because he had heard that summons before. It almost caused him to turn
  the head of his horse and drive straight toward the point from which the
  signal had come. But he knew that that call was not for him, now.</p>

  <p>It was the call for Parade, and the big horse suddenly went mad. He became
  the center of a whirling tumult. Men yelled in terror as he tried to get at
  them with his heels and his teeth. And suddenly he was fleeing with two ropes
  flinging out from his neck, uselessly. If only one of those ropes did not
  become entangled with his legs and drop him like a shot!</p>

  <p>"Kill the horse!" yelled someone. "Silver's only half himself without his
  horse! Kill Parade!"</p>

  <p>But that was not so easy. Parade ran dodging through the crowd, and it
  would have taken a sure and daring hand to fire at him without fear of
  sending the bullet into human flesh. Yet there were actually shots fired, and
  Taxi's heart stood still. It was as if he were watching a human running the
  gantlet, instead of the flight of a horse.</p>

  <p>Then, on the verge of the crowd, the whistle sounded again. A big,
  panther-swift man leaped into the saddle, flattened along the back of the
  stallion, and sent Parade racing straight for the corner where Taxi waited.
  It came to Taxi, as an afterthought, that he was a partner in that flight. He
  pulled his mustang around and spurred; together they rushed down the dusty
  length of the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; TWO FUGITIVES</h2>

  <p class="first">Duff Gregor felt like a boy who has stolen a great wedge of
  pie and does not know where to bite into the treasure.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian was taking a siesta in the cool entrance shaft of the old
  deserted mine which was the hiding place of the pair since they had fled from
  Crow's Nest. Duff Gregor, seated on the side of the old, grass-grown dump of
  the mine, looked over the heads of the pine trees down the mountain slope to
  the flash of creek water near which they had buried one of the canvas sacks
  of the treasure. The other sack they had sunk in the floor of the first shaft
  that branched to the left of the entrance.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Gregor that he was seated on a throne from which he could
  view half the world. He could see the river in the bottom of the valley into
  which the creek flowed. He could see the smudge of distant smoke which
  announced the existence of the town of sawmills. He could see the thin span
  of the bridge that crossed the river above the waterfalls. He could see the
  road that wound up through the green valley bottom.</p>

  <p>It was a world in which the fools labored, and the wise men, like Duff
  Gregor and Barry Christian, sat on thrones and looked at the ant-like toil of
  lesser humans, now and again descending from their higher level to take away
  some of the accretions of wealth which the poor drudges had heaped up.</p>

  <p>It was a delightful existence, thought Duff Gregor. It was for this that
  man was designed and made strong, with two hands equipped for snatching away
  the spoils of lesser folk. It was delightful, and it was kingly. Duff Gregor
  was new to a throne, but he felt that the role would grow increasingly
  natural to him. He only needed robes.</p>

  <p>He could tell what those robes would be&mdash;long-tailed coats and white
  shirt fronts, with white ties and the great, rich flash of a jewel, here and
  there. In his ears, in his blood, there was continually running, not the
  music of mountain winds and mountain waters, but the song of violins and the
  whispering of feet over the floors of ballrooms. It seemed to Duff Gregor
  that he had always had a way with women. Now he wanted to use it, politely,
  in the best society. He felt that he knew just how to overwhelm the feminine
  brain by his free spending.</p>

  <p>When he had finished surveying the world before him, this world which he
  was about to leave for the joy of great cities, he turned his attention to
  the newspaper which was a portion of the spoils that Barry Christian had
  brought back from his raid of the night before.</p>

  <p>When they needed either provisions or information, they raided, not
  together but singly, because they felt that it would be a shame if both of
  them should be captured, and all of the good money from the bank in Crow's
  Nest be left to rot for many years in the ground. They would go down singly,
  therefore, and bring back from their excursions all the information that they
  could pick up, together with necessary provisions. For, though in retirement,
  they lived very well up here at the entrance to the old mine.</p>

  <p>The mountains, though it was many days since the robbery of the bank,
  continued to be filled with searching parties, for the rage of the people
  against "Jim Silver" passed all bounds.</p>

  <p>That was the beauty of the affair. That was what the masterful brain of
  Barry Christian had provided. They had committed a crime, they had
  "inherited" a fortune, and all they needed to do in order to escape from the
  dangers of the pursuit was to step back into their old selves. That is to
  say, all they needed was to make this change as soon as the public excitement
  had abated a little. Soon the little toiling parties of manhunters would no
  longer be observed from the aerie, and then the two could drift away into the
  larger world of men and be seen no more.</p>

  <p>Christian was especially fond of referring to honest men as the "ants,"
  and he called the hunting parties the "soldiers." Gregor smiled, as he
  thought of that, and shaking out the newspaper, he scanned the headlines with
  a calm eye of interest.</p>

  <p>It was the Crow's Nest Sentinel that Christian had brought, and it was
  still crammed with details that concerned the great bank robbery. It pleased
  Gregor to find the phrase "great bank robbery." The crime was historical. It
  would never be forgotten. It was a monumental affair both on account of its
  size and because of the skill with which the criminals had worked. It was, in
  short, a perfect bit of work, and to be connected with such an event was
  worth some years in prison, even.</p>

  <p>"Was Jim Silver the Robber?" said the top headline, in red letters. The
  article below it read:</p>

  <p>Was Jim Silver the robber?</p>

  <p>If so, who were the two men who were hunted out of Crow's Nest immediately
  after the crime and who were almost overtaken in the act of riddling with
  bullets the shack five miles from Crow's Nest where the celebrated character,
  Taxi, was fighting for his life?</p>

  <p>Would Jim Silver permit an attack on Taxi, his best friend, his most
  celebrated admirer and faithful follower?</p>

  <p>If Jim Silver robbed the bank, would he have been foolish enough to
  re-enter the town immediately after the crime was committed? Common sense
  tells us that this could not be.</p>

  <p>People are ready to swear, now, that the man who was jailed in Crow's Nest
  for the crime and who was delivered by the frantic devotion and the
  incredible daring and skill of Taxi was, in fact, not the man who had been
  employed as watchman at the bank.</p>

  <p>Miss Ruth Wilbur, who risked her life to save the poor fellow from the
  hands of the crowd, vows that it was not the same man. There are many others
  willing to swear to the dissimilarity, now. Unfortunately, on the day of the
  excitement they did not dare to lift their voices because the majority of the
  citizens were too enraged to listen to calm reason.</p>

  <p>It seems that we have been hoaxed by a cunning actor who "doubled" for the
  famous Jim Silver. If so, how can the injustice be undone?</p>

  <p>Hundreds or even thousands of men are working through the mountains in an
  attempt to spot the criminals. Will they be able to tell the real from the
  unreal?</p>

  <p>We need the real Jim Silver to help us find the false one. But could the
  real Jim Silver venture back to offer his services to us without running the
  risk of being shot down at a distance?</p>

  <p>The whole affair is confused, and in the meantime every moment that passes
  makes it more and more unlikely that the two desperadoes will be apprehended.
  Certainly they must have found means of disposing of most of their stolen
  wealth before this day.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor read over this article several times. He licked his lips as he
  read.</p>

  <p>There were other things in the paper to which he gave a more casual
  attention. There was the notice at length, for instance, that Henry Wilbur,
  the banker, having almost entirely recovered from his collapse on the morning
  of the robbery, was pushing ahead plans for the sale of all his property in
  order to pay back what promised to be about ninety cents on the dollar to
  every depositor in the bank.</p>

  <p>There was a long editorial comment on the nobility of Mr. Wilbur's action,
  and the editor remarked that Mr. Wilbur was not really a banker at all, but
  the father of his community, preferring to surrender his own welfare to that
  of his children.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor grinned.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian, he felt, was entirely right. They were just ants, those
  others. The little spot of their labors was their entire existence, and one
  of them would shed his precious blood to secure the good of the
  community.</p>

  <p>His thought drifted from Henry Wilbur to the character of the banker's
  daughter, and at this point Duff Gregor's self-content began to rub thin.</p>

  <p>He said, finally: "Aw, it ain't the first time that I was a fool! I'll
  forget it, like I forgot the other times." Lifting his eyes from the
  newspaper, he looked down into the bottom of the valley and became aware that
  there was a scene of violent action down there. Yes, there was a faint, far
  sound, smaller than the noise of bees, and it was composed of the rattle of
  firearms.</p>

  <p>Two men were being chased up the valley by more than thirty riders, and
  one of the fugitives was mounted upon a horse that shone like gold.</p>

  <p>"It ain't Jim Silver. It can't be Jim Silver," said Duff Gregor to
  himself.</p>

  <p>He snatched out a pair of field glasses and peered through the strong
  lenses until the scene was drawn up closer to him. Then he was sure. He was
  sure not only because he could see more of the matchless running of the
  golden horse, but he could understand why it was that so patently glorious an
  animal did not draw away from the hunt. It was because the rider preferred to
  risk his own neck by returning again and again to defend his companion, who
  was not nearly so well-mounted.</p>

  <p>That companion was a smaller man and he was riding like a jockey, bent far
  forward in the saddle; but though his weight must have been slight, still he
  could not draw away from the best riders of the pursuit. They would have
  closed in on him like hounds on a tired deer, had it not been that the rider
  of the golden horse turned back time after time and opened fire on the posse
  with his rifle.</p>

  <p>Each time, the posse fanned out, scattered, and returned the bullets with
  a great, random spread of fire. But always the daring hero on the golden
  horse swung away again, unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Barry! Barry!" called Duff Gregor. "Come out here!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked the sleepy voice of Christian, from inside the
  mine.</p>

  <p>"There's a thing out here that'll do you more good than anything else you
  ever seen in your life," answered Gregor. "Come out here and take a
  look."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, it's not worth spoiling my sleep," said Christian
  angrily. "Duff, will you ever grow up and have sense?"</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" answered Gregor.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I mean."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't come out here and look, I suppose," said Gregor, "if Jim
  Silver and Taxi were down there in the hollow, being run to death by about
  thirty gents?"</p>

  <p>"Don't bother me," answered Christian.</p>

  <p>"Because," shouted the other, "that's exactly what's happening down there,
  or else I'm blind as a bat and a fool besides."</p>

  <p>Christian, suddenly, stood beside him, gave one glance into the green
  hollow of the valley, and then snatched the field glasses. He held them in
  his steady hand for only an instant before he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"You're right. And it is Jim Silver. The other fellow&mdash;can that be
  Taxi? Duff, am I going to see the end of both of 'em on one day?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE GAMBLING CHANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">Duff Gregor stared with incredulous joy. "You know Silver by
  the horse," he exclaimed, "but what makes you sure of Taxi? You ain't
  sure!"</p>

  <p>Christian answered as he followed with his eyes the action in the valley
  beneath him, saying:</p>

  <p>"There comes the wave of 'em after Taxi! He's turning around to fight
  back. He can't run any more on that dead-beat horse. Now Silver comes
  sweeping back to him. He waves his arm at Silver to send him away. What man
  in the world would do that except a fool like Taxi? He's waving Silver away,
  but Silver comes on in between Taxi and the posse&mdash;and the posse
  scatters. Why do the fools scatter?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't they scatter?" asked Duff Gregor. "Ain't Silver the sort
  that doesn't know how to miss?"</p>

  <p>No matter how interested he was in the moving picture beneath them,
  Christian was too annoyed by the last remark of his companion to let it pass.
  He lowered the field glasses suddenly and turned his handsome face toward
  Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Gregor," he said, "you know something about Jim Silver, and you've heard
  a good deal about him from me. Don't you understand that the law-abiding are
  as safe from him as sheep are from a sheep dog? If that were a mob of thugs
  riding up the valley after him, or if your own precious person were in the
  lot, you can be sure that his bullets would be biting flesh long before this.
  But those fools are riding on behalf of the law, as they think, and they're
  perfectly safe from him. They ought to know it&mdash;but they won't know it.
  They've got their own ideas and they'll stick by them."</p>

  <p>He clapped the glasses back to his eyes again. Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Silver's shooting the gravel away in front of their horses. He's kissing
  the air beside their heads. I can see them duck. Now Taxi and Silver are
  running for it again."</p>

  <p>He lowered the glasses a second time as the fugitives passed into a dark
  cloud of trees. The posse men herded in pursuit.</p>

  <p>"They've got 'em!" exclaimed Duff Gregor. "That's the end of Mr. Jim
  Silver. That's the end of Taxi, too. That's the finish of the pair of
  'em."</p>

  <p>He observed that Christian was shaking his head, slowly, with an air of
  grave doubt.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Barry," urged Gregor. "What else can happen? Silver is too crazy
  to leave Taxi. Taxi's horse is dead spent, and a lot of those horses in the
  posse look full of running. They've got fifteen to one. How can they fail to
  catch Silver and Taxi?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Christian. "It simply isn't in the books."</p>

  <p>Gregor started to laugh, but something of suffering and a sternness of
  pain in the face of Barry Christian dried up the mirth on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Barry," said Gregor. "Are you believing what you say?"</p>

  <p>"Silver can't be run down like a dog. A lot of house dogs can't run down a
  wolf like Jim Silver," said Christian. "When he dies, it'll be because
  another sort of man has come to grips with him."</p>

  <p>"A man like Barry Christian?" hazarded Gregor suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"D'you think that you are fated to wipe Jim Silver off the face of the
  earth?" asked Gregor, half sneering.</p>

  <p>Christian looked at him without anger, answering: "I don't think a great
  deal about it. It's simply a feeling in my bones that one day Silver will be
  the death of me or I'll be the death of him."</p>

  <p>"Why, it's working out like that now," declared Gregor. "You do a big job
  and saddle the blame of it on Silver, and the crowd runs him down. It's your
  work that's finishing off Jim Silver right down there in the pines."</p>

  <p>Christian answered: "You don't understand. When the finish comes, we'll be
  hand to hand. I don't even think that there'll be knives or guns. Just hand
  to hand!"</p>

  <p>He turned his right hand palm up and looked down at it. This curious mood
  of detachment, Gregor had observed in his famous companion more than once
  before this, and it always troubled him. There were times when it seemed that
  Christian was listening to unearthly voices, and this was one of the
  times.</p>

  <p>Christian began to walk up and down before the mine, deep in thought, and
  Duff Gregor followed him with a calculating eye. Trouble, he felt, was in the
  air. He was not surprised when he heard Christian say:</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll have to get out of this."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that we're going to move?" demanded Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Because we're perfectly fixed, up here. Nobody dreams that we're
  staying put like this. Nobody thinks that we're tucked away with all that
  money in a hole in the ground. We're fixed here, Barry. We're safe. We'd be
  fools if we stirred away from here before we had to!"</p>

  <p>Christian looked far away, and shook his head. "I don't like it!" he said.
  "You don't like what?"</p>

  <p>"Silver. He's too near us. If he's as near as that, he'll get the wind of
  us."</p>

  <p>"How can he do that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Don't ask me how Silver does things. Ask me how he got out
  of jail when a mob was trying to lynch him."</p>

  <p>"Why, Taxi did that job."</p>

  <p>"All right. But it was more impossible for him to get out of that jail
  than it is for him to find us."</p>

  <p>"Barry," said Gregor suddenly, "tell me something. Are you afraid of
  Silver?"</p>

  <p>Christian pointed solemnly at the sky.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of lightning?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. But what's that got to do with it?" demanded Gregor.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I feel about Silver the way I do about lightning. That's
  all. I feel that he may strike at any time. He's near us. We've got to
  move."</p>

  <p>"It's a crazy thing to do," groaned Gregor, knowing that he would have to
  give way to his leader. "When do we start?"</p>

  <p>"Now," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"Now? Right out in the broad daylight, where these manhunters can get a
  look at us?"</p>

  <p>"The day helps the other fellow to see you, but it also helps you to see
  the other fellow. We'd better start now."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor snapped his fingers and whistled to express the wordless
  vastness of his condemnation of the proposal.</p>

  <p>"It's the craziest thing that I ever heard of," he declared. "I never
  heard anything to beat it. Listen to me, Barry. I'll tell you what we'll do.
  We'll toss a coin to see whether we start now or at moonrise tonight."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Christian. "Toss the coin."</p>

  <p>He smiled a little as he said it, for he knew that Gregor was fond of
  appealing to the deathless love of the gambling chance that was part of
  Christian's nature.</p>

  <p>Gregor pulled out a coin and threw it high into the air. At the top of its
  rise it hung for an instant, spinning so fast that it was reduced to a single
  twinkling eye of light.</p>

  <p>"Heads," said Christian.</p>

  <p>The coin came down with a spat on the flat of the ground. Christian and
  Gregor leaned over it.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Christian. "We start at moonrise."</p>

  <p>"It's better that way, isn't it?" Gregor said.</p>

  <p>Christian shrugged his big shoulders as he said: "I don't know. There's
  something like frost working in my blood. But let's forget it."</p>

  <p>So they forgot about it. At least, Christian seemed to have abandoned all
  care about the future, for he stretched out and slumbered heavily during most
  of the day. Gregor observed him with a good deal of awe and envy. He could
  understand that sheer power of will had enabled Christian to abandon fear for
  the time being and discard all forethought. So Christian slept, and Gregor
  daydreamed of the future, until sunset.</p>

  <p>In that hour between day and dark Christian wakened and with Gregor ate a
  cold supper. He absolutely refused to light even the smallest of fires for
  fear that either the smoke or the red eye of the blaze should be seen.</p>

  <p>The sunset colors went out. The mountains stood like black islands, for a
  time, in a sea of fading green. Then the night shut closely in. The stars
  burned lower and lower until they reached their full brightness, and not long
  after, the moon rose.</p>

  <p>They had brought the horses up out of the mine, before this, and saddled
  them and rolled their blankets. Now they tethered the pair to a sapling and
  went down the hill to get the canvas sack of treasure which they had buried
  near the bank of the creek.</p>

  <p>The nerves of Christian were so finely strung, by this time, that he
  stopped short when a twig crackled a little distance up the slope.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" whispered Christian. "Something alive stepped on a twig, up there.
  A man?"</p>

  <p>"Men ain't the only things that walk through the wood," answered Gregor.
  "Don't get nervous, Barry."</p>

  <p>He wondered at himself, giving advice like that to a creature made of
  steel springs, like Christian.</p>

  <p>Still, for a long moment, Christian listened. He stood where a spot of
  moonlight struck him through the branches of a pine; now he shifted out of
  this light, making no noise as he stirred. At last he murmured:</p>

  <p>"All right. We'll go ahead. But keep your ears open."</p>

  <p>They went on down to the bank of the creek, where the moonlight broke
  through the shrubbery in the midst of which they had buried the first canvas
  sack. Christian had brought down from the mine the same broken-handled shovel
  with which he had dug the hole in the first place. The earth turned easily,
  but as the hole opened, and he drove the shovel blade strongly down, he
  uttered a faint exclamation of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>In place of answering, Christian fell to work digging furiously. After a
  few moments he stopped. Gregor could hear him panting, but more than the
  sound of the heavy breathing was the sight of the long-barreled Colt that was
  leveled at him suddenly in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"You know what's the matter, you thieving dog!" said Christian. "You've
  stolen the sack away from this place!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; MISSING LOOT</h2>

  <p class="first">Gregor stared at the hole in the ground and then at the gun,
  lifted his eyes last of all to the set, grim face of Barry Christian. He knew
  that there was as little mercy in the soul of that man as in a piece of
  hard-tempered steel.</p>

  <p>"Stolen?" gasped Gregor. "The sack stolen? Gimme the shovel!"</p>

  <p>He took the shovel and fell to work furiously, enlarging and deepening the
  excavation until the shovel began to bite into the clay hardpan. Then he
  stepped away from his work with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Not possible!" said Gregor.</p>

  <p>"Possible? Anything's possible for a rat with a yellow, sneaking heart!"
  said Christian. "Now just double-quick to the place where you hid the stuff
  out for yourself."</p>

  <p>The brain of Gregor spun.</p>

  <p>"But I didn't touch it. I don't know where it is," he said.</p>

  <p>"You will know in a minute," said Christian. "Do your thinking while I
  count to ten. You can stop me any time by telling me that you remember."</p>

  <p>"Barry," said the other, "are you clean out of your head, man? If I wanted
  to get everything for myself, I could have brained you today while you were
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"You know I sleep light," answered Christian.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I would have stood by here," said Gregor, "knowing you were
  digging down to something that wouldn't be there and that you'd accuse me of
  stealing? Barry, man, have sense. I could have filled you with lead while you
  were digging the hole just now."</p>

  <p>Christian hesitated, as though he hated to believe what he heard or give
  up the grim purpose which had already hardened his mind.</p>

  <p>At last he said: "There's something in what you say."</p>

  <p>"Of course there is. There's everything in it," groaned Gregor, sighing
  with relief.</p>

  <p>"Then who could have taken it?" demanded Christian.</p>

  <p>"The devil, for all I know," said Gregor. "It's the craziest thing that I
  ever heard."</p>

  <p>"The name of the devil is Jim Silver," said Christian, "and he can hardly
  have been here. But the woods are full of soft-footed mountaineers, all eyes
  and ears. One of 'em might have seen us bury the stuff. In that case, he'd
  just dig up the loot and cart it away. Of course, he wouldn't inform the
  sheriff."</p>

  <p>"But why should he fill in the hole again?" asked Gregor.</p>

  <p>"So that we wouldn't start looking for his trail, if we happened down here
  soon to look at the spot where the stuff was hidden," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"Aye, and that must be it," admitted Gregor.</p>

  <p>"That's it, and little good it does us!"</p>

  <p>They stared at one another. Slowly, with small, jerky, uneasy moves,
  Christian put away the gun. There had been murder in his mind, and it was
  hard for him to discard the temptation in a single gesture. If a killing were
  to be done, Gregor knew that Christian would go about it as calmly and as
  methodically as he had gone about the blowing of the safe in the bank.</p>

  <p>"We'll go back to the shaft and get the second sack," said Christian
  finally.</p>

  <p>Gregor nodded. He knew, as he turned up the hill, that he would not get
  half of what remained of their loot. The generosity of Barry Christian had
  appeared in the first division of the spoils; now that he had satisfied his
  superstition, it was unlikely that he would give his companion more than one
  part in five of what remained. And the great, bright dreams of Gregor grew
  suddenly dim, and the music of the violins sounded cold and far away.</p>

  <p>If he got as much as forty or fifty thousand dollars, he would not blow in
  a penny of it. He would simply buy an annuity. A man was a fool not to make
  sure of a steady income. What turned a crook into a drunken bum was going
  broke so often&mdash;having to endure frost without a penny in his pockets.
  Then there was the terror of old age when the prison shakes made it
  impossible for a man to pick a lock or a pocket. No, every sensible fellow
  should put aside a nest egg. That was what Duff Gregor would do with his
  split in this game.</p>

  <p>He thought of that as they went up the hill.</p>

  <p>Christian, half a step ahead, twice stopped the progress by holding out
  his hand while he listened.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" whispered Gregor impatiently.</p>

  <p>"There's something in the air," muttered Christian.</p>

  <p>"Yeah? You're getting instinctive again," growled Gregor.</p>

  <p>They came up to the mouth of the mine, and there Christian waited for as
  much as five minutes, lying stretched out with his ear to the ground at the
  entrance to the shaft.</p>

  <p>"Listenin' for ghosts?" demanded Gregor.</p>

  <p>Christian got to his knees and gave his companion a single silent glance.
  It was enough to make Gregor decide that he would certainly make no further
  insolent comments on the state of mind that was now troubling the great
  criminal. "All right," said Christian calmly. "Give me the lantern. Light
  that lantern and give it to me."</p>

  <p>They had found at the mine a rusted old lantern and a bit of oil in a
  five-gallon can. They had furbished up the lantern, and now Gregor lighted it
  and silently handed it to Christian.</p>

  <p>"Walk ahead of me," said Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" exclaimed Gregor. "You think that I'd try anything?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Christian.</p>

  <p>He shifted the lantern into his left hand.</p>

  <p>"Walk ahead of me!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Barry, what do you mean to do to me, in there?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Christian, "because I hope that we're going to find the
  second sack. I hope nothing is going to happen to you!"</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Gregor, trembling, "that if we don't find the sack,
  you'll think I've swiped it?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody might have seen us bury the first sack down there by the creek,"
  said Christian, "but nobody could have seen us bury the sack in the mine. Go
  ahead. Get to the stone and lift it."</p>

  <p>Gregor stared, trying to penetrate the mist of brightness that sprang up
  from the lantern. But all he could see of the face of Christian was as
  harshly forbidding as a carved stone.</p>

  <p>He remembered, then, how many murders had been laid at the door of Barry
  Christian. Murder of all kinds. He was one who could enjoy the sensations of
  a gentlemanly duel. Pace off a distance under the eyes of impartial
  witnesses, turn at a call, shoot. Christian had done that more than once, and
  always killed his man, though not without collecting some lead in his own
  person. But he was also ready for other sorts of slaughter. Shooting through
  a window into a lighted room was something he was not a whit above. Nothing,
  in fact, that had a practical value to him, would be beneath his pride.</p>

  <p>That was the tiger who was to walk behind Gregor into the darkness of the
  mine. But there was nothing for Duff Gregor to do except shut his teeth so
  hard together that the shuddering of his jaws ceased. He stepped right into
  the mine, so briskly that Christian had to caution him to go more slowly.</p>

  <p>They came to the first turn on the left and went down the long, ancient
  shaft. The timbering bulged at the knees. It was green with mold below and
  cracked with weight above. Water seeped through, here and there. Before their
  approach, rats squeaked and fled.</p>

  <p>Gregor kept drawing in his breath. But there seemed to be no good air,
  there underground. He could not get enough oxygen. He was stifling.</p>

  <p>He found himself standing over the stone. Of course the sack would be
  under it. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>He laid hold of the edge of the rock, gripped it, and gave a hard pull,
  for the rock weighed close to two hundred pounds. Up came the stone slab and
  exposed beneath it a cavity quite large enough to have held the
  sack&mdash;but there was no sign of the treasure.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor knew that death was only a fraction of a second away from him.
  He sagged forward in the middle of his body, because he expected the bullet
  to strike him in the middle of the spine.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Barry!" he breathed. "You took both sacks, and now you're going to
  murder me to have me out of the way! Listen to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'You dog, if you could talk like an angel in heaven," said Christian, "I
  wouldn't listen to you. Gregor, you're a dead man!"</p>

  <p>"I want you to listen to me," said Gregor. "I don't care about the money.
  You can have it. I never expected half of it, and you can have the whole lot,
  if you want it. I never laid claim to a half of it. You know that. You gave
  me a half, when I didn't expect it. You know that, Barry. Man, what good'll
  it do you to murder me? You've got all the money; why d'you want to kill me?
  I'll never get on your trail, because I know that your kind of medicine is no
  good for me!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he knew, before he heard the answer, that he would not win.
  But the last of his strength of persuasion went into his voice.</p>

  <p>Then he heard Christian say: "I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;because
  you've talked pretty well, and I admire brains in any man. I'll give you your
  life, Gregor, but you'll have to show me both sacks."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that I'd give you the money if I knew where it was?"
  cried Gregor.</p>

  <p>'"No," said the deadly voice of Christian, "because you're a fool and
  because you think that I won't live up to my promise. You think I'll bargain
  with you, Gregor. But I tell you I'd rather lose a hundred million dollars
  than keep my hands off a treacherous cur like you! It's for the good of my
  own soul that I'm going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>"Will you let me turn around and&mdash;take it in front?" asked Gregor.
  "Let me turn around and take it from in front, Barry. For the sake of
  everything that we've been through together, let me take it from in front.
  Don't shoot me in the back, like a dog."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to shoot you in the back like a dog," said Christian, "because
  a dog is what you are. It's the only death that's proper for you. Are you
  ready? Do you want to whine out one prayer before I let you have it?"</p>

  <p>A supernatural acuteness came to the ears of Gregor then.</p>

  <p>"Look out! They're coming!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Christian chuckled. "Are you going to try to make me turn my head with a
  silly old trick like that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I hear them!" said Gregor. "I hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then, quite audibly, a small landslide rattled not far away onto the
  floor of the shaft. Christian expelled a gasping breath; a gun cracked. The
  lantern, smashed to bits, was flung to the floor. And then a great voice
  boomed in the shaft:</p>

  <p>"Barry Christian, I've come for you!"</p>

  <p>The voice of Christian rose to a scream, not like the scream of a man, but
  that of a tortured woman.</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver!" he yelled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; IN THE DARK</h2>

  <p class="first">Gregor had no time to feel thankfulness for his deliverance.
  He knew, as the lantern was smashed, that Christian had dropped to the floor
  of the shaft. Gregor did the same thing. He stretched out his hand and
  touched the foot of Christian&mdash;crawling forward to meet the danger.</p>

  <p>Gregor himself could not stir at all, for an instant. The thing was not
  clear in his mind. It seemed like the proceeding of madmen.</p>

  <p>Why had they not called on Christian to surrender?</p>

  <p>Well, there would have been no sense in that, perhaps. Barry Christian had
  been in prison before, waiting in the death house for the hangman, and it was
  said that he preferred death in any form to another spell of waiting in that
  grim chamber. No, Christian would not surrender. But since that was the case,
  why had not Silver driven a bullet through his body at once?</p>

  <p>Because, perhaps, the prophecy which Christian had made was now about to
  be fulfilled. One of them was to die neither by knife or gun, but in the bare
  hands of the other.</p>

  <p>Gregor, sick, stifled with fear, gradually forced himself forward. A thin
  ray of light struck him right in the face. He rolled over to get away from
  it, and tried a snap shot. Christian, almost beside him, fired at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>The echoes thronged. There was the rattling of another little slide of
  rocks that had been loosed by the force of the reverberations.</p>

  <p>Then the thick, black, damp darkness pressed down on them again. There was
  such an agony in the spirit of Gregor, such a terrible tenseness of fear,
  that he thought for a moment that he had been wounded. Only gradually he came
  to realize that the shuddering contractions of his muscles were not caused by
  a physical torture.</p>

  <p>Out of that desperation came a natural reaction such as occurs in every
  man of strength and courage, when his back is against the wall. It was
  impossible that even Jim Silver could readily master the great Barry
  Christian. And, in the meantime, he, Duff Gregor, might be able to strike
  some sort of a blow in the dark. No doubt, since Silver was there, Taxi was
  with him. Well, that would be the meat for Duff Gregor. He knew the size of
  that slender fellow, and if once he could get his hands on Taxi, he was sure
  that he could give a quick accounting of him.</p>

  <p>He hoped only one thing&mdash;that as he groped his way through the
  darkness, his hands might not encounter a body as large as his own, and
  enlivened by the spirit of a hunting tiger. He hoped only that he should not
  encounter Jim Silver, while Taxi fell to the share of Barry.</p>

  <p>Gregor forced himself ahead, steadily. If he paused, he knew that the fear
  would sicken him and make him lie down, shuddering.</p>

  <p>The thin ray came again and stabbed him right straight in the face. He
  wriggled aside from it, and fired instantly. Big Christian fired, also, and
  again the echoes in a double roar ran up and down the shaft and knocked
  several little landslides loose.</p>

  <p>How did that devil, hidden in the darkness, know how to find a human face
  like that with the unshuttered ray of a lantern? How could he feel for and
  find it?</p>

  <p>Then there was a stifled grunt just ahead of him on the right. That was
  the voice of Christian. The ray of the lantern split the dark again in a
  single flash, like the stroke of a sword, that cut across the dim picture of
  two huge men, the force of whose struggles was lifting them from the floor.
  One was Barry Christian. The other was Jim Silver. It must be he. Taxi was by
  no means of the same size, and, therefore, Gregor hurled himself forward
  through the darkness with a savage confidence. If he could beat the small
  form of Taxi out of his way, if he could dash forward into the open and seize
  a horse&mdash;well, better a life term in a penitentiary than five minutes
  more of this breathless hell!</p>

  <p>So he half rose and dived forward, and a hard, compacted body of a man
  caught him.</p>

  <p>The weight of his rush and the superior poundage of his body hurled the
  smaller figure before him. He yelled with triumph. He lifted the revolver
  over his head to bring it down on the other. And then the very superiority of
  his charge brought them both crashing to the ground. An instant later a vice
  clamped around Gregor's throat. No, he had been caught in the crook of an
  arm, but it was an arm that knew its business. Red sparks struck across his
  vision in a whirl.</p>

  <p>Well, he would settle the business of Taxi once for all. He twisted his
  right arm and the revolver in his right hand. And then his right wrist was
  caught. It was raised, and his hand was beaten down against the floor. The
  revolver spilled out of the nerveless fingers and rattled far away. Something
  hard struck big Duff Gregor behind the ear, and there was one red flash in
  his brain, then darkness.</p>

  <p>He knew&mdash;sometimes the subconscious mind marks time for us&mdash;that
  his senses were gone hardly half a minute, but when he could see and think
  again, he was tied. His hands were bound behind his back, and his feet were
  lashed together. And he heard a panting voice that gasped out: "Keep away
  from him, Taxi! He's mine. He's all mine!"</p>

  <p>Gregor, twisting his head to the side, could see the slender ray of the
  electric torch cutting again and again across the bodies that were locked
  together. They were on the floor of the shaft. They twisted this way and
  that. Then, tumbling once, suddenly they heaved to their feet again. Gregor
  saw the face of Barry Christian, and closed his eyes to shut out the
  picture.</p>

  <p>While his eyes were dark, Gregor heard the sound of the blow. It was
  delivered with the fist, he knew. When he looked again, he saw Christian
  falling. Silver caught him in mid-air, turned him, dropped with him, crushing
  the inert body under his weight.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Silver. "It's over, Taxi."</p>

  <p>"He almost got the knife into you, Jim," said Taxi. "Are you hurt,
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Not a scratch," said Silver. "Let's have the light while I tie him."</p>

  <p>He tied only the hands of Barry Christian, then he stepped over to Gregor
  and took him by the hair of his head and jerked the head back.</p>

  <p>Gregor could understand. Big Jim Silver's name had been blackened; he had
  almost lost his life because of Gregor's play acting. And now, shuddering,
  Gregor waited for blows delivered with the heel of a heavy Colt, blows that
  would spoil that resemblance between them, blows that would make him a
  hideous mask forever.</p>

  <p>Instead, Silver merely played the light on him for an instant and then
  said:</p>

  <p>"I thought it must be you, Gregor."</p>

  <p>That was all. But the effect of the words kept reverberating through the
  mind of Duff Gregor until it seemed that his soul was a mighty chasm, a great
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>He knew then that there would be no personal revenge. There would only be
  the law. And in spite of himself, no matter how he strained his mind, Gregor
  could not understand. It was wrong. It was all wrong, he felt.</p>

  <p>He heard Christian come to, groaning, and the voice of Silver said:</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd lasted half a minute longer, Barry. There would never have
  been a need for a second wait in the death house, then!"</p>

  <p>They got out of the mine and to the horses. The prisoners were not lashed
  hand and foot. Their hands were simply tied behind their backs. Their horses
  were attached to the horses of their captors, and the first thing that big
  Duff Gregor noted was the presence of both the canvas sacks.</p>

  <p>One thing stuck strongly in Gregor's mind. It was when Silver said:</p>

  <p>"Look, Taxi. That's the horse that they thought was Parade. That's a bit
  of an insult, isn't it? Poor old Parade!"</p>

  <p>Well, it was in fact an insult, now that the two stallions stood side by
  side. Gregor could not have said wherein the great dissimilarities lay; he
  only knew that there was as much difference between the two as there is
  between painted and real fire.</p>

  <p>For that matter, when he felt himself near to the real Jim Silver again,
  he wondered how even a five-year-old half-wit could have mistaken him for
  that famous man.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian, from that moment, spoke not a word. He kept his head
  high, and stared at the moon. He looked like a poet drinking in
  inspiration.</p>

  <p>It was Gregor who said: "Well, boys, you got us. But how'd you get at the
  sacks?"</p>

  <p>"The wisest old man in this part of the mountains," said Jim Silver, "told
  us about every inch of the country for ten miles around, and when he spoke
  about the old mine, I thought there might be just the ghost of a chance. When
  we came near enough to spot you, Gregor, we did a little circling about, and
  it wasn't hard to find your trail down to the creek. I suppose you'd been
  down there several times a day to take a look at things. I don't blame you,
  but it left a bit of a trail, and we found it. Afterward, when you went down
  the hill, we went inside and Taxi's flashlight showed us the way to the rock
  in the floor of the shaft. It was luck that we lifted it."</p>

  <p>"And why," asked Gregor, "didn't you shoot us to bits while we were
  sitting out in the sun, in front of the mine?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Jim Silver, "in this case it was more important to get the
  money than it was to get the men. We've had all the luck, though, and
  corralled you both."</p>

  <p>After that, they took the back trail toward far-off Crow's Nest, going
  down first into the valley. What seemed strange to Duff Gregor was that the
  two men never congratulated one another on the success of their enterprise.
  Neither did they speak about any of the joys that they were to encounter in
  the future, when a shamed community would have to recognize its folly
  publicly. The trip was made almost entirely in silence, and yet that silence
  was big, for Gregor, not so much with the knowledge that years of prison life
  lay ahead of him, but because he was to be the eye-witness to the end of the
  great Silver-Christian feud, about which men had talked for years.</p>

  <p>Well, even in a prison, Duff Gregor would now be a great man. There was no
  shame in being conquered by Taxi and Silver. Where the great Christian had
  fallen, he, Duff Gregor, could well afford to fall, also.</p>

  <p>They rode out onto the narrow wooden bridge that spanned the river just
  above the waterfall. On clear, windless days, from the mine, Gregor had been
  able to hear the murmur of the distant cataract. He heard its more distinct
  roaring now, sleepily, and the hollow beating of the hoofs of the horses was
  unreal, like sounds in a dream, also.</p>

  <p>Halfway across the bridge, Barry Christian showed what he was made of. He
  must have spurred his horse deep in both flanks, for the brute leaped
  suddenly ahead, with a side thrust that almost knocked Parade over the low
  railing on the opposite side. When that failed, as Silver reached out
  suddenly for his prisoner, Christian swayed forward, flipped himself out of
  the saddle, and in falling, struck the rail of the bridge.</p>

  <p>The effect was to start his body spinning, and it spun all the way down
  until it reached the black, swift face of the water beneath.</p>

  <p>Gregor, peering over the edge of the bridge, saw the water splash and leap
  under the impact. Afterward, they could all see the body of the man rise,
  spinning slowly in the twist of the current.</p>

  <p>Taxi drew out a rifle, but Silver held out a forbidding hand.</p>

  <p>"The rest has to be outside of our doings," said Silver. "The waterfall
  will finish Barry Christian."</p>

  <p>They saw the body sweep down toward the rocks that fringed the edge of the
  cataract.</p>

  <p>"Jim," said Taxi, "there's a chance that he could land on one of those
  rocks&mdash;and get ashore in some way!"</p>

  <p>"There's a chance," said Silver. "About one chance in ten thousand. I
  wouldn't take that chance away from him."</p>

  <p>He took off his hat. Taxi turned his quick, nervous glance toward his
  friend and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The murdering devil," said Taxi. "My hat stays on, no matter how he dies.
  He ought to have been burned an inch at a time!"</p>

  <p>Jim Silver said nothing, and Duff Gregor found himself staring at the big,
  handsome face of the man he had "doubled"; like a child he was staring and
  vaguely trying to grasp at the emotions that must be stirring in the great
  heart of Silver.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE RETURN</h2>

  <p class="first">It was early morning when the three rode into Crow's Nest,
  but men are up early in the West, and the streets were already rather
  well-filled. They were quickly packed. Before the trio had gone a block,
  everyone down to the children had poured out of the houses. Even the crowd
  which had gathered at the house of Henry Wilbur in order to attend the
  auction, heard the word of what was happening in the main street and came
  flocking to witness the rare event.</p>

  <p>And all was silence as fixed as that which had greeted Silver on his first
  coming into Crow's Nest.</p>

  <p>The explanation was there before their eyes. The "double," who could only
  exist in fiction, was there before their eyes, riding the horse which was,
  indeed, a far cry from the greatness of the stallion, Parade.</p>

  <p>There was such a crowding, a short distance from the bank, that the riders
  had to slow up; and then a few questions were fired and answered very briefly
  but very calmly by Jim Silver. Then the word flew wildly through the town
  that the night watchman had been no other than the great Barry Christian, and
  that Christian had been swallowed by the Kendal River, and whirled over the
  falls just above the town of Kendal.</p>

  <p>At last, then, the great trail was ended, and the long and famous duel
  between Jim Silver and Christian had come to an end. Perhaps that was why the
  face of Silver was so calm, his eye so unlighted by any malice. No, the
  explanation seemed to be that the man knew how to forgive. His faint smile
  was as ready for the citizens of Crow's Nest as, it seemed, for any other men
  in the world. But to many of the crowd the most interesting figure of the
  three was Taxi. He was younger than the others, and there was less that was
  impressive about him. For that very reason, when they measured him with their
  eyes against their knowledge of what he had done in that very town, he became
  a hero.</p>

  <p>But Crow's Nest was shamed. It was shamed to the heart. That was why there
  were no more than murmurs, here and there, in the crowd, as room was made for
  the procession.</p>

  <p>It reached the jail, where Sheriff Dick Williams came out into the street
  and simply threw up his hands at the picture that greeted him. Then, before
  everyone, he went up to the true Jim Silver and grasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've been a fool. Forgive me, Silver!" he said.</p>

  <p>Silver said, so that a great many people could hear him: "How could you
  help going wrong, Sheriff? When Barry Christian built a plan, it always
  seemed as strong as a house. I'm the lucky fellow that I didn't get my neck
  stretched. I had a lot of luck&mdash;and Taxi. That's all that saved me, but
  I don't blame anyone except a dead man."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor went up the steps of the jail, and at the door he turned and
  looked down onto the street.</p>

  <p>It reminded him of the days when he had sat at the entrance to the mine
  and considered honest men as toiling, stupid ants. Now he saw the toilers
  thronging about Silver. His last speech had started the shouting. The people
  waved their hats and yelled themselves hoarse for him, and still they did not
  know the best part of his story!</p>

  <p>Well, there was something in honesty, after all, thought Duff Gregor. As
  for himself, there was the darkness of prison days. As for Barry Christian,
  surely there was nothing but the darkness of the grave. But reputation, no
  matter how evil, had come to Gregor, increasing his stature. That was why his
  head was high as he stepped along through the door and heard it clang behind
  him with a deep and resonant echo that chimed through the steel forest of
  cells.</p>

  <p>Down the street, riding slowly, Silver and Taxi found their way through
  the crowd, until they came to the bank. There they dismounted and took two
  big, heavy, well-filled canvas sacks with them into the place. At the
  entrance, Jim Silver paused and rubbed out with his handkerchief the words
  which Henry Wilbur had chalked up not long before&mdash;that promise to pay
  with all that he owned in the world.</p>

  <p>Silver turned and said to the bystanders:</p>

  <p>"Somebody please tell Mr. Wilbur that we have found the stolen stuff and
  it is all here with us. If there's a safe place down here in the bank, he had
  better come and put it all away."</p>

  <p>Happiness makes more noise than anything else. It makes more noise even
  than hatred. Because hatred tears the throat with its roaring and is soon
  forced to silence, but happiness laughs and sings. And all of Crow's Nest was
  laughing and singing.</p>

  <p>That crowd flowed like a river to the Wilbur house. There it gave Henry
  Wilbur the news. It did more than that. It picked him up on its shoulders and
  cheered every step of the way that it carried him back to the bank. It picked
  up Ruth Wilbur, also, and with bad manners and much good nature, it swept her
  down to the bank, too.</p>

  <p>"You saved Jim Silver's neck," they told her, "and Jim Silver saved the
  neck of Crow's Nest."</p>

  <p>They brought her right into the bank; they presented her to Jim Silver
  with that speech; and then they began to recede, still shouting and roaring
  and applauding their act.</p>

  <p>As the roaring of the crowd withdrew from the big room and beat on the
  outside of the building like a sea, Henry Wilbur knew that his life work was
  saved. He knew that his bank had gained fame which was strength that could
  not fall.</p>

  <p>He said: "I want to gather my words, Taxi, so that I can try to thank you.
  Not to thank you, but to tell you a few of the things that this means. But
  where's Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Taxi. "Don't call him. Don't trouble him. Don't even look at
  him!"</p>

  <p>In spite of that, Wilbur looked, and saw at the rear corner of the big
  room, half lost behind the forest of bronze-gilt steel bars, big Jim Silver
  and the girl standing face to face, she with her head thrown back, looking up
  with something more than a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" whispered Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask. Don't think. Hold your breath!" whispered Taxi.</p>

  <p>Then they saw Silver bend far over and lift the girl's hand and kiss
  it.</p>

  <p>And it did not seem like fancy manners, either.</p>
