  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">PETER DUNN walked into his grandfather's study in Berkeley
  Square, and the old man scowled up at him from over his gold-rimmed
  pince-nez.</p>

  <p>This was in the year '18. when the street lamps were painted black so that
  wandering German aeroplanes should not be quite sure whether they were over
  Berkeley Square, or Hyde Park, and when Marylebone Road was all lit up like
  Piccadilly to attract enemy bombs&mdash;happily, Marylebone did not know
  this.</p>

  <p>Peter met the scowl with a large smile.</p>

  <p>"No good roasting me, sir. I'm not going to argue with you or say anything
  unpleasant about the Germans&mdash;I've been fighting 'em and they're pretty
  sporting...."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us discuss it," said Sir Leslie with dangerous calm. "What do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir&mdash;I've left the army and I've no money and no equipment
  except a knowledge of human weakness. Thank God, sir. I've lived long enough
  with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us quarrel," Sir Leslie's calm was pre-typhonic.</p>

  <p>Peter smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"Well, the point is this, sir&mdash;I've got no profession and no
  occupation except getting my leg X-rayed to find odd hits of shrap, and I
  thought, now that the last of the hardware was out of my system, I might as
  well do something."</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie removed his glasses with offensive deliberation. He was a tall,
  spare man with a gaunt face and the palest blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"And you want me to finance you in a motor-car business.... or is it a
  poultry farm?" His voice was silky&mdash;but a sort of hard silk. "Or
  possibly you and a few other optimists are thinking of ranching in Canada? A
  pleasant occupation: riding expensive horseflesh around a wilderness looking
  for new faces amongst your calves."</p>

  <p>Peter's grin broadened.</p>

  <p>"You ought to write a book, sir?" he said admiringly. "You've got
  imagination and a style!"</p>

  <p>"Let us confine ourselves to realities," said Sir Leslie, not wholly
  displeased: "and to simplify matters let me say that I am allowing you five
  hundred pounds per annum. Beyond that I will not go. You have a certain spuri
  ous glamour because you were shot in the leg. A man at my club once referred
  to you, emotionally, as a hero. I don't think you are a hero, You are what
  they call in America a nit-wit. Every time I see you I regret that I accepted
  a baronetcy from this damn Government&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's keep politics out of it." said Peter cheerfully. "I'm going to be a
  policeman."</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie surveyed him dispassionately.</p>

  <p>"A what man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A copper." said Peter. "You know&mdash;the blokes who wear helmets and
  try doors and run in old gentlemen who get chucked out of the Empire."</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie winced. It had happened nearly thirty years before. And he was
  certainly not old then.</p>

  <p>"Have you any respect in your system?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. You're a grouchy devil and I'm very fond of you. But I
  don't respect you. You're not harmless enough to be respected. Now what about
  it&mdash;do I lose that monkey?"</p>

  <p>"If you refer to the five hundred a year&mdash;no," said Sir Leslie. "I
  don't care whether you're a policeman or a postman. I was perfectly sure
  you'd get a job where the unfortunate taxpayer would have to provide your
  salary. Good night, Peter."</p>

  <p>"Cheerio!" said Peter, and went out.</p>

  <p>Eight years later almost to the day, Detective Sergeant Peter Dunn came
  into the office of the Assistant Commissioner and addressed him familiarly.
  It had taken various officers of the Metropolitan Police Force all those
  eight years to accustom themselves to Peter's friendliness. Quite a number
  decided to remain unaccustomed, and, if his reprimands from outraged
  superiors had not been weighed down in the balance by the awards and
  commendations of magistrates and judges, he would have remained plain
  Constable Dunn. And that not long.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm in rather a hole&mdash;by the way, that
  Bridlington case is cleared up: we took the son-in-law of the murdered woman
  this morning and he made a true and penitent confession. No third degree, I
  assure you&mdash;just a little persuasion of the gentlest kind."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Peter&mdash;what's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>Peter frowned and shook his head. He was very tall and fair and
  young-looking, broad of shoulder and long-legged. He was the type that sings
  in its bath and walks as if on springs. As a constable he had taken to the
  station, unassisted, Wilfred Lamb, a notorious beater of policemen, wives and
  miscellaneous citizens. And the divisional surgeon worked through the night
  like a sempstress, putting stitches into Wilfred where and as they were
  required.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather's dead&mdash;good old boy. Got tight on vintage port and
  fell down the stairs. A glorious death. I believe he has left me a quarter of
  a million&mdash;<i>and</i> the baronetcy. I could keep very quiet about the
  quarter of a million, but the baronetcy is a label&mdash;I can't duck it.
  'Sergeant Sir Peter' is too silly, so I'll have to clear out. And after all
  the amazing knowledge I've accumulated&mdash;it's a dead waste."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your chief charm is your immodesty," he said. "Yet for once I'm in
  sympathy with you. You <i>are</i> a brilliant policeman and I don't know how
  we'll find somebody to take your place. I'll see the Chief and try to wangle
  something."</p>

  <p>A week later Detective Sergeant Sir Peter Dunn was passed to the Reserve.
  And from time to time he was called to New Scotland Yard to assist in certain
  investigations, receiving for his services fees which about paid the licence
  on his 20 h.p. Rolls and left a little over for cigarettes.</p>

  <p>Peter knew Dr. Lal Singh. He had prosecuted him once for obtaining money
  by a trick and had failed to secure a conviction. The doctor was a little,
  round-faced Indian with a London degree and no practice. He was a clever
  surgeon, one of the cleverest that had passed through St. Giles' Hospital,
  but there was a prejudice against his colour, and men of his own race avoided
  him because he had a sharp tongue and an invincible weakness for being paid
  in advance for his services. He lived in lodgings near Gower Street and had
  his surgery in a slum off the Edgware Road,</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly he could have made, by certain illicit practices, quite a
  large income, but he was superior to the importunities of dope peddlers and
  others. Possibly he took up clairvoyance to save himself from starvation.
  This he practised first at his lodgings, hiring a sitting-room for his
  séances, and afterwards in a Bayswater flat, For money began to come to him
  in respectable quantities, and he was able to rent and furnish an apartment
  near Westbourne Grove.</p>

  <p>Hither came many ladies of society and ladies who were not in society, and
  members of the younger set who had been told how perfectly marvellous this
  seer was. And Dr. Lal gazed into crystals and saw tall, fair men who loved
  his clients, and short, dark women who were working to rob them of their
  husbands. And he told the discontented young matrons that they would be
  married twice and have two children, a boy and a girl, and would be shortly
  going on a long journey which would bring them great profit. One day a tall,
  fair man called on Dr. Lal and was told that he would inherit a title and a
  vast sum of money. "How the devil did you know that?" asked the astonished
  Peter.</p>

  <p>"Recognition of distinguished police official and private knowledge of
  circumstances," explained Dr. Lal, showing his white teeth in a smile.</p>

  <p>It was his jest to ape the style of his less educated compatriots. He
  dropped into good English now.</p>

  <p>"I do not charge for my services, sergeant," he said, and waved his podgy
  hand to a side table near the door. On this was a large box of Benares brass,
  and above it a small printed notice:</p><br>

  <p class="note">"No charge is made by Dr. Lal Singh for his demonstrations.
  Money placed in this box will be distributed to such charities or employed
  for such purposes as he may determine."</p><br>

  <p>The prosecution which followed was none of Peter's business. He had been
  detailed for a duty which he carried out gladly, for he was the Yard's
  authority on Human Weakness and was a tower of strength to the Modus Operandi
  (or, as they call it, "M.O.") department.</p>

  <p>He rather liked the little doctor, and was glad when the prosecution
  collapsed. After the case he went down to Bayswater and had a talk with Dr.
  Lal.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go back to India. I have hundreds of loathful relations
  and to tell you the truth I am not <i>persona grata</i> with the ruling
  political organisation in India. I should be boycotted and humbugged. Here
  there is opportunity for brainy man even if handicapped by excessive
  colour."</p>

  <p>"What will you do now?" asked Peter,</p>

  <p>There came a strange gleam to the brown eyes of the doctor, and he tapped
  his nose with a coppery finger.</p>

  <p>"I have a truly brain-turning idea! It requires capitalistic help, but,
  what a success is promised if project is satisfactorily pursued! My skill, my
  studies, the poetry of my imagination&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>"Are you going to be a bookmaker?" asked the interested Peter, but the
  little doctor did not reveal his dream.</p>

  <p>"Money can be made with celerity," he said earnestly. "I shall appeal to
  certain human emotions&mdash;the most prevalent ambition in the bosom of
  mankind! I can do this thing better than any man, and for obvious reasons. As
  a boy I enjoyed the dubious advantage of association with certain magical
  fakirs of India, Some of their deeds were so much nonsense and chicanery. On
  the other hand, there was wheat amidst the chaff of their so-called
  knowledge. I set you a puzzle, mister! Disintegrate the same!"</p>

  <p>The clairvoyant business languished after this but although the frugal
  doctor sold up his furniture and let his flat, Peter suspected that poverty
  had nothing to do with the flit. Soon after Dr. Lai closed his surgery in
  Edgware Road, and the next thing Peter heard about him was that he had drawn
  a prize in the Calcutta Sweepstakes, some six or seven thousand pounds. Peter
  wondered if he would exploit his brain-turning idea now that he had
  capitalistic help.</p>

  <p>All this was ancient history when there came to Scotland Yard three
  inquiries concerning the Lost City Men. Peter came up from Southampton in
  response to an urgent wire and interviewed the Chief Constable.</p>

  <p>"I want you to take this case, Peter." said the chief. "You will be
  nominally under Crowther, but you'll have a free hand. Here are the
  facts."</p>

  <p>The first fact was Thomas Henry Middlethall, of Middlethall, Merton &amp;
  Payne, silk merchants of the City of London.</p>

  <p>Mr. Middlethall was a rich bachelor who lived in Fitzjohn's Avenue,
  Hampstead. He was a man of fifty-six, with artistic tastes, and was well
  known in theatrical circles. He had financed one or two musical shows, was to
  be seen in the more sedate of night clubs, and on these occasions generally
  accompanied a pretty young actress. It was not always the same lady.</p>

  <p>He had left his house one day, saying he would be away not more than ten
  days. A month, two months had passed and he had not returned. A letter had
  been received by, his partners, written in his own hand, saying that he
  intended taking a longer holiday, and asking if he might be spared. Four
  weeks after his disappearance there was a curious happening in Fitzjohn's
  Avenue.</p>

  <p>It was a Wednesday night, and of the four servants he employed three were
  absent from the house. On Wednesdays he invariably gave three servants an
  afternoon and an evening off.</p>

  <p>The servant in charge of the house was a middle-aged housemaid, a woman
  named Keating. She was not in the servants' hall, where she should have been,
  but in a little room opening from the first landing at the head of the
  stairs. It was, in fact, Mr. Middlethall's private snuggery, and there were
  certain forbidden books on his bookshelf which it was the ambition of his
  servants to read. These were behind a locked grille fastened to the front of
  the bookcase, but Peter gathered on investigation that the grille could be
  opened very easily, and every servant in turn had profited by his absence to
  sample the volumes printed "for private circulation only" whenever
  opportunity offered.</p>

  <p>Engrossed as she was, she heard the sound of a key turning in the outer
  door, but thought it was the cook returning and did not stop reading.
  Presently she heard another sound&mdash;another key was being turned. This
  time it could only be in the lock of Mr. Middlethall's study.</p>

  <p>Very alarmed, she put down her book and, opening the door, listened. She
  heard nothing, and gaining courage, she went out onto the landing. There was
  a dim light burning in the hall. Mr. Middlethall was conservative enough to
  use gas as an illuminant.</p>

  <p>As she looked over the banisters she saw a man emerge from the study. At
  first she thought it was Mr. Middlethall. That gentleman of a peculiar method
  of dressing which bordered upon the eccentric. She recognised the rather long
  jacket and the shepherd's plaid trousers&mdash;but the wearer was not Mr.
  Middlethall. He was a much younger man, and thinner.</p>

  <p>Too horrified to scream, she stood motionless and watched the intruder
  pass into the street. From where she stood she could see through the fanlight
  a car waiting outside. He had hardly disappeared from view when the car moved
  off.</p>

  <p>Miss Keating seems to have shown a presence of mind rare in such
  circumstances. She called up the police station, and in a few minutes was
  telling her story to the divisional inspector. The study had been left
  unlocked, one of the desk drawers had been opened and, on the floor, the
  inspector found a long envelope, the red wax seal of which was broken. It had
  obviously contained a new cheque-book posted from Mr. Middlethall's bank. The
  police instantly communicated with the bank, traced the cheque numbers, and
  gave instructions that no cheque taken from this book should be honoured.</p>

  <p>This took a little time, as did the interviewing of general managers, and
  before the stop order went forth the first of the cheques had been cashed at
  a City branch of the bank. Apparently Mr. Middlethall had an arrangement
  whereby his cheques could be cashed at any of four branches. The cheque was
  in his handwriting and it was indubitably his signature. Peter made a
  microscopic examination, and the result left no doubt in his mind that this
  was not a forgery.</p>

  <p>The next day brought a letter from Mr. Middlethall, obviously written in
  some haste, with no evidence that it had in any way been dictated. It was
  addressed to the manager of the bank, and ordered that functionary to cash
  any cheque not exceeding five hundred pounds at intervals not shorter than a
  fortnight that might be drawn on his account. it bore a London
  postmark&mdash;S.E.I.</p>

  <p>"That's genuine too," said Peter. interviewing his immediate superior.</p>

  <p>"He may have been kidnapped and kept a prisoner somewhere," suggested
  Crowther.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You can't mistake it for anything but what it is&mdash;a note written
  spontaneously. Look at the spelling mistakes and the overlining,"</p>

  <p>"Has he drawn any cheques since he's been away?" asked the puzzled
  inspector.</p>

  <p>This was one of the first inquiries Peter had made. "None," he said.
  "That's one of the curious features of the case."</p>

  <p>It was on that day that the story of the second disappearance came to
  headquarters. This time it was a Mr. George Grives, an eminent solicitor in
  the City of London, a clubman, and something of a <i>bon vivant.</i> In many
  respects his history ran on parallel lines with that of Mr. Middlethall. He
  also was something of a ladies' man, and had once figured in a case which
  nearly resulted in his being struck off the rolls. He had a flat in the West
  End, where he entertained extensively. He was something of a dandy.</p>

  <p>He had left his office, telling his managing clerk that he was going to
  Aix for a ten-days cure. On the tenth day the clerk received a telegram,
  handed in at London, telling him that Mr. Grives had returned but was leaving
  that night again for Aix.</p>

  <p>Nothing was thought of the matter until the managing clerk mentioned the
  fact casually to a City detective who had called to make inquiries concerning
  a case of fraudulent conversion. The officer reported to his chief; the news
  was telephoned to Scotland Yard; and within an hour Peter was in the office.
  He learned nothing, except that Mr. Grives had a very close friend, one
  Charles William Sedeman, a wholesale provision merchant, with a warehouse and
  office in Tooley Street.</p>

  <p>"He'll probably know more about Mr. Grives than any man in London. I
  really don't think there's anything wrong, Mr. Dunn." (Peter was always known
  as "Mister" in the course of his inquiries.) "Very probably the governor
  has...."</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to repeat the libellous suggestion of Mr. Grives'
  managing clerk. He spoke from knowledge, and had a wide experience of his
  middle-aged employer's flightiness. It struck Peter as a very possible
  solution, as he was driving, to Tooley Street.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sedeman was not in his office, and was unlikely to return that
  day.</p>

  <p>"Can I see his secretary?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before admission was gained to this important official,
  a pallid young man with large horn-rimmed spectacles, who spoke rather
  precisely.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sedeman? I am afraid you won't be able to see him.
  Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Dunn. Mr. Sedeman is taking a holiday. The work here has
  been very heavy in the past six months. You probably know what happened to
  the bacon market in March,"</p>

  <p>Peter not only did not know, but was not aware that bacon had a market. He
  was interested to learn that bacon had been doing things which had sprinkled
  the heads of many provision merchants with large silver threads.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know bacon did that sort of thing&mdash;not good bacon." said
  Peter. "Where is Mr. Sedeman staying&mdash;has he gone to Aix?"</p>

  <p>The secretary hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well...." he said rather reluctantly, "originally Mr. Sedeman went away
  for ten days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Peter stared at him. "Ten days? Was that his original intention?
  When did he leave?"</p>

  <p>The secretary gave him a date. It was five days after the departure of the
  lawyer.</p>

  <p>"And what happened?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>'He decided to extend his holiday for another month."</p>

  <p>"Did he telegraph you to that effect?"</p>

  <p>The young man was obviously uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, to be exact he didn't. He sent a letter by a Messenger, who
  asked me if I would send Mr. Sedeman's cheque book. By the way, he was
  supposed to be staying at Bognor, but I have reason to believe he never went
  there. That, however, is a matter which is not quite my business, and it is
  outside my duties to make inquiries as to Mr. Sedeman's destination. The
  messenger brought a letter. and in face of the order I could do no more than
  give him, in a sealed envelope. Mr. Sedeman's private cheque-book. What made
  it so queer was his colour."</p>

  <p>"The messenger's colour?" asked Peter quickly, "Was he dark?"</p>

  <p>"He was very dark," said the young gentleman in a hushed voice! "in fact,
  he was an Indian."</p>

  <p>It was only at that moment that Peter connected Dr. Lal Singh with this
  mysterious transaction. He described the little doctor faithfully, took the
  secretary with him to Scotland Yard, and there produced, from his own private
  collection, a photograph of the clairvoyant surgeon, He was instantly
  identified, and a call was circulated through London and the provinces.
  asking for information concerning the whereabouts of this sometime seer.</p>

  <p>The secretary was able to furnish Peter with a photograph of the vanished
  Sedeman, and later that day this was supplemented by photographs of the other
  missing men. Peter examined them critically in the presence of his chief.</p>

  <p>"They're not exactly oil paintings, are they? Wicked old devils, I should
  imagine."</p>

  <p>"Why did they all decide to go away for ten days, and extend their stay?"
  frowned Crowther. "That to me is the oddest part of the business. Are they
  all bachelors?"</p>

  <p>"Only Middlethall. The other two are benedicts."</p>

  <p>"Happily married?" asked Crowther.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they're living apart. I very badly want to meet Lal Singh," he
  said after a moment's thought. "I have an idea he's going to tell me
  something that will give me a laugh."</p>

  <p>Inspector Crowther smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"If you find these birds in the river with their throats cut you won't he
  so amused."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," said Peter. "It doesn't take much to make me
  laugh."</p>

  <p>The following day the Manchester police sent through an inquiry. Mr.
  Pinchin, a wealthy cotton-broker, had been missing from his home for two
  months. His home was the best hotel in Manchester, where he maintained
  permanently a suite of rooms. It was not unusual for him to go away for
  months at a time: in fact, he had often gone to America with little or no
  warning to his office. So that when he did not return at the appointed time,
  the office was not particularly worried. it was the slackest period of the
  year, most of the office staff were on holiday, and the police were not
  notified until the bank questioned a cheque for £400 which had been presented
  and paid. In this case the broker had left no address, given no clue to his
  destination. The only certain thing was that he'd left for London, after
  which all trace of him was lost. He did not go to the hotel where he usually
  stayed when he was in town, nor was he seen by his London agent. Like the
  other three, he had vanished into the earth.</p>

  <p>Peter went up to Manchester by the first available train, and saw Mr.
  Pinchin's accountant, who apparently was privy to all the broker's secrets.
  The visit to Manchester was not wholly unproductive. Peter learned that, the
  day before he disappeared, Mr. Pinchin had very carefully cut out an
  advertisement from a London newspaper. He had been interrupted in the act and
  had shown some confusion. and had ordered the interrupter, who was an office
  boy, out of the room.</p>

  <p>Again the detective managed to secure a photograph of the missing man,</p>

  <p>"It is," said Peter, describing the photo to his chief over the 'phone,
  "the face of one who has warmed both hands in the fires of life and got
  slightly scorched. Will you get me a copy of the <i>Megaphone</i> for the
  eighteenth of July, and have it waiting for me when I arrive?"</p>

  <p>He reached London, to learn that news had been received of Dr. Lai Shrub.
  A manufacturing, chemist had received from him an order for a very deadly and
  little known Indian drug, and this had been supplied and forwarded to what
  the police afterwards discovered was an accommodation address. The drug had
  been collected by the doctor personally. It was not the first time such an
  order had been received by the chemist, In his books Peter traced no less
  than five deliveries in as many months.</p>

  <p>The copy of the newspaper he required did not arrive until late that
  night, and Peter sat up till two in morning, reading advertisements one by
  one, and trying to find in them a certain sinister significance.</p>

  <p>He made his discovery in the early hours of the morning, and wrote a
  carefully worded letter on a sheet of notepaper bearing his own private
  address. And all the time he wrote he laughed, once so violently that he
  blotted the sheet before him and had to make a new start.</p>

  <p>An answer to his letter came the following evening (Peter had used the
  name of his butler), and early one hot summer morning, Peter Dunn took train
  for Barnham Junction, which is in Sussex.</p>

  <p>He expected to find the little doctor on the platform, but instead he
  found a very attractive and capable young woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Herberts?" she asked. "The doctor has sent the car for
  you."</p>

  <p>There was a little two-seater outside the station; the girl seated herself
  at the wheel and invited him beside her. Half-an-hour's drive through the
  most delightful scenery brought them to a rather imposing villa which was
  hidden from the road by high box hedges, carefully trimmed. They passed
  through the gate and up the drive, and there under the portico, waiting to
  receive them, was the most urbane of Indian doctors, wearing a spotless white
  jacket and rubbing his hands in anticipation of new revenue.</p>

  <p>He saw Peter and his jaw dropped; but he recovered himself instantly.</p>

  <p>"If you will accompany me to my sanctum sanctorum" he said, not without
  dignity, "explanations can be offered."</p>

  <p>"No explanation is necessary. I want to see three or four gentlemen who I
  presume are living in this house, and whose absence is causing their friends
  a little anxiety," said Peter.</p>

  <p>The doctor hesitated, then, walking quickly ahead, he turned the corner of
  the house on to a broad lawn.</p>

  <p>Four men were playing bridge in a rustic summer-house. and though Peter
  had seen the photographs of all, he could recognise none.</p>

  <p>"Here's the advertisement," Peter pushed it across the table to Chief
  Inspector Crowther, and the big man fixed his glasses and read.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"For Men Only. Why be plain through life? In ten days I can
  change most unconvincing countenances to the most youthful visage. Consult me
  secretly."</p><br>

  <p>The address of an advertising agency followed.</p>

  <p>"That is all there is to it," said Peter. "These fellows went in for a
  beauty treatment&mdash;a start of bloodless face lifting. I've no doubt Lal
  Singh added to his surgical knowledge a few things he'd learnt in India. The
  trouble with Lal Singh was that he was a jolly sight too successful! I've
  seen these fellows, and the change is amazing&mdash;so amazing, that they
  dared not go straight back to their circles of friends, for fear they were
  not recognised. Dr. Lal has been complaining bitterly of their ingratitude.
  With his astringent lotions&mdash;I discovered the property of the Indian
  drug, he bought&mdash;and his treatment, he cut all signs of age from their
  faces so effectively that they demanded to be put back where they were. It
  must be a horrible discovery to find you're looking like somebody else. Poor
  Grives is going abroad for two or three years; he says he dare not show
  himself in the Courts till the effect of Lai Singh has worn off."</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand, said Crowther, "is why Middlethall was prepared
  to pay more than the others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take a good look at Middlethall's photograph," said Peter.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">LONG before Peter Dunn had succeeded to the baronetcy, when
  he was plain Detective Dunn, he met Henry Drewford Lesster, though he never
  retained a very vivid impression of that unfortunate young man. It was on a
  night when he met other graduates of the great university&mdash;to be exact
  on Boat Race night&mdash;and Mr. Lesster was one of half-a-dozen boisterous
  and hilarious young gentlemen whom he had been called upon to eject from a
  West End theatre.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lesster had appeared before a police magistrate and had paid his fine.
  The only thing that Peter ever remembered about him was that he spelt his
  name with two S's. It was just this odd circumstance of memory, that he
  should retain as an identity amongst thousands of other arrests and
  detentions.</p>

  <p>Two years later the accident occurred on the Worthing Road. A big touring
  car, driving towards London late one Sunday night in June, crashed into a
  small car, in which a London doctor was driving his wife and two friends back
  to town. One of the men passengers was badly injured. The big car had its
  radiator and bonnet smashed, the small machine was a wreck,</p>

  <p>Fortunately there was near the spot a cyclist policeman who was
  practically an eye-witness of the accident, if such events can be witnessed
  in the dead of the night. He came up, rendered first aid and sent the injured
  man in a passing car to a hospital, before he carried out the routine of
  taking numbers, examining licences and jotting down particulars of the
  accident.</p>

  <p>The big car was undoubtedly on the wrong side of the road. The driver, a
  dazed young man, smelt strongly of drink. His licence bore the name of Henry
  Drewford Lesster.</p>

  <p>The constable was young and inexperienced, or he would have known that it
  was his duty to take the driver to the police station and to charge him with
  a very serious offence&mdash;that of being drunk whilst in charge of a motor
  car&mdash;or, at any rate, to submit him to the tests which a police surgeon
  would impose. Instead, he took particulars from the licence, warned the
  delinquent that he would be summoned and allowed him to proceed on his
  way.</p>

  <p>There was no question&mdash;the man was drunk. The driver of the small car
  was emphatic on that point, and when in the night the injured man died, the
  unhappy constable was suspended by his inspector for his failure to make the
  arrest.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard was communicated with, and it fell to Peter Dunn to make
  inquiries about the motorist&mdash;one of those odd jobs that make up the
  life of a sergeant of the C.I.D.</p>

  <p>The address was an expensive flat in Park Lane, but he found it in the
  possession of a wealthy stockbroker who had taken it for two years.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lesster has been ill for some time and he is living in the country
  with an aunt."</p>

  <p>He had the address, which Peter copied into his book&mdash;Deeplands,
  Kensham, Berks.</p>

  <p>Deeplands was an old Queen Anne house that lay in the middle of about six
  acres of unkept ground. There was a general air of neglect about the place.
  The windows, except two or three that lit the drawing-room, were shuttered
  and dirty. There was about it an atmosphere of mystery which appealed even to
  one who professed to despise mysteries as creations of imaginative
  writers.</p>

  <p>He knocked and pulled the big-iron-handled bell. It was a long time before
  he heard the bars being removed and a key turn. A tall, broad-shouldered
  young man. with a red, unshaven face and hair that had not been brushed or
  combed. opened the door. Peter thought he was a caretaker until he heard him
  speak, and then he realised that it was the voice of an educated man.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked suspiciously. When Peter stated his
  business he shook his head, "He is not staying here; he is abroad. He went
  abroad six months ago."</p>

  <p>"Is this his house?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. and as he did so a voice spoke from the hall behind
  him. He opened the door a little wider, and a middle-aged woman came sweeping
  across the parquet floor. "Sweeping" literally&mdash;she wore a dress which
  had almost a train. Her hair was brassily golden. Her face, an old-looking
  face, was powdered and rouged. On one arm was a mass of diamond
  bracelets.</p>

  <p>"You want to see my nephew?" she asked harshly. "He went to the Continent
  this morning. He came home last night with his car smashed up, and took his
  smaller car and left very early. He said he was going to Paris."</p>

  <p>Peter was puzzled. He recognised a relationship between the sot who had
  opened the door and the grotesque woman, and learned soon after that they
  were mother and son.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman told me he had been away for months&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"My son knows nothing about it," she said harshly. "He went to bed early
  last night, and be didn't know that Henry had returned. He only comes here
  occasionally. Would you like to see the car?"</p>

  <p>How would she have known that he bad come to make inquiries about the
  accident? This woman was a shrewd guesser, he thought, and became suddenly
  interested in her. It was not an unusual type, the woman who refused to grow
  old and clung to the illusion that art could revive the past glories of
  youth.</p>

  <p>Picking up the train of her dress, she led the way to a big garage, and he
  saw the damaged car and made one or two notes in his book.</p>

  <p>"You are a police officer, aren't you? I expected somebody would call.
  Henry is very wild. He is consumptive, you know, and he started drinking
  about a year ago. He is a great worry to me."</p>

  <p>"Where do you think I shall find him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea. He disappears for months at a time and
  never takes me into his confidence."</p>

  <p>"Who are his lawyers?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>Again she shook her bead.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he has any. I hold his power of attorney, but I never had
  to use it."</p>

  <p>The cabman who drove Peter back to the station gave him one or two
  interesting items of news about Deeplands.</p>

  <p>"We have had some queer fish living there," he said. "One was a German who
  called himself Schmidt. I am the only man who knows what his real name
  was&mdash;Egolstein. Is there such a name?"</p>

  <p>"Egolstein'?"</p>

  <p>Peter was immediately interested. Was it a coincidence?</p>

  <p>"He is the fellow that got twenty years for robbing a mail boat&mdash;I
  saw his picture in an old paper. That's how I knew it was he...."</p>

  <p>Then it was Egolstein, the most dramatic and sensational bank smasher of
  his age.</p>

  <p>Peter asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, he was no relation of Mrs. Lewing or Mr. Lesster&mdash;Mr.
  Lesster took the house after Egolstein went away. It belongs to a
  parson."</p>

  <p>The driver had never seen young Mr. Lesster, though he knew he used to
  stay at Deeplands when he was ill.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing, there has been another man after the house," said the
  loquacious driver (his conveyance was an open touring car, and Peter sat by
  his side). "There was a young gentleman down here only last week who tried to
  look over it, but Mrs. Lewing and young Mr. Lewing were out &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the servants would not admit them?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"There are no servants. The old lady and her son do the work in the house.
  Rum lot, ain't they?"</p>

  <p>Peter agreed that they were a rum lot; but then, the world was full of rum
  lots, and he took no further interest in Deeplands until Jo Loless called
  upon him.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn did not like old lags. He steadfastly refused to believe in
  their penitence, and when they told him that they were going straight and
  that all they needed was a couple of pounds to buy a new kit of tools so that
  they could start work next Monday morning, it was his practice to say things
  which would have sounded cruel and harsh to the sentimentalist who did not
  know the peculiar psychology of the professional wrongdoer.</p>

  <p>There had been a time when he had taken the trouble to look up the records
  and to discover exactly the trade for which the mythical kit of tools was
  intended, but now he turned down the ill-written pleas automatically.
  Naturally, there was a certain variation in the begging letters which came to
  him. Sometimes it was requested that he should advance eighteen and two-pence
  for the purpose of taking the writer to his dying father, brother, aunt,
  sister or wife, who lived in a town just that distance from London.
  Occasionally the appeal was a pathetic request that he should make a small
  loan to get an overcoat out of pawn.</p>

  <p>It may seem curious to all except those who understand the queerly
  intimate relationship between the police and the criminal, that such requests
  should be made at all; but those who are acquainted with the inner working of
  Scotland Yard know how frequently they come to every officer, and especially
  to an officer reputedly as rich as Sergeant Sir Peter Dunn.</p>

  <p>The request of Jo Loless might have shared the fate of its fellows but for
  its unusual character. Jo wanted nothing less than a letter of
  recommendation, not to the landlord of a house which he was desirous of
  renting, but to its present tenant. It was apparently a fairly large house;
  he wrote of it vaguely as being "in the suburbs of London," and the rent was
  two hundred a year. which is an unusually high one for a house in such a
  situation, and amazingly expensive for a man in Jo's position.</p>

  <p>Peter was on the point of throwing it into the waste-paper basket when
  something peculiar in the phraseology, caught his eye, and he read it
  again.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"During the time I was in Dartmoor, as you know, Sir Peter,
  I have been just released. I worked out a formula for making malleable glass.
  I put a little money by and have enough to furnish the place and pay the rent
  for two years besides keeping myself. The house I have decided upon is ideal
  for my purpose. I think the present tenants could be persuaded to let me have
  the house if they knew you were interested in me. Frankly, my outrageous
  request is that you should help me by giving me a letter to them telling them
  not that you are a friend of mine, but that you are interested in my
  acquiring the house."</p><br>

  <p>Peter read the letter and frowned. It sounded like a lie, and yet Jo
  Loless would not lie. He was a shrewd confidence man, a glib teller of
  stories, who had gone down for five years for a brilliant job which had
  miscarried owing to the activities and intelligence of the man to whom he was
  writing.</p>

  <p>Jo Loless had had a good education, was a clever business man. Peter read
  the letter for the third time and, taking a sheet of paper from his
  stationery rack, scribbled an invitation for Joe to call.</p>

  <p>He liked this suave, rather good-looking rogue, who had graduated from one
  of the medical schools into a more or less strenuous method of gaining a
  livelihood, who never ceased to jest about his appropriate name and its
  psychological influence in the determination of his career, and never adopted
  any other. He was indeed one of the few crooks whose names appeared in the
  annals of Scotland Yard who had never adopted an alias.</p>

  <p>Joe called after dinner the next night. a debonair figure in correct
  evening dress, and not even the most suspicious of mortals, seeing his
  fashionably cut clothes, would have imagined he had a few months before been
  working behind the walls of Dartmoor prison. His hands were perfectly,
  manicured, his hair glossy and well-brushed. He wore pearls in his white
  shirt front, and the thin cigarette case he took from his white waistcoat
  pocket bore a monogram in diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Sit down. Joe. and help yourself to a drink," said Peter. "Had a bad
  time?"</p>

  <p>Joe pulled up the knees of his trousers very carefully and exposed his
  silk-covered ankles, then sat down.</p>

  <p>"I do not drink&mdash;you've forgotten my habits," he said. "No, it wasn't
  so bad as you could have wished."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of this house? What is it called, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Deeplands." said Joe, and Peter stared at him. "May I?"</p>

  <p>Joe took out a cigarette and poised it inquiringly. Peter nodded and he
  lit it.</p>

  <p>"I like the place; it's got about six acres. The house is in a shocking
  condition, and a couple of ghastly specimens are living there, but I will
  have the place put right. It is away from the beaten track. Incidentally. it
  is just outside the Metropolitan Police area."</p>

  <p>"Malleable glass." Peter's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said the other coolly. "It is one of the dreams of scientists,
  more practicable than the philosopher's stone, but only just. There is, I
  believe, a big, old kitchen in the house that would make a marvellous
  laboratory&mdash;I was in the laboratory at Gresham, if you will examine my
  dossier, and I was rather keen on chemical research work. I have cached
  enough of my illicit gains to keep me comfortably for a year or two, and I
  might have a very amusing time, without troubling you fellows, with a
  possibility that in the end I can build up a big fortune."</p>

  <p>Peter was watching him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you will succeed?"</p>

  <p>Jo pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The trouble with me, Dunn, is that I have principles.
  Before now I have sacrificed a considerable fortune rather than stray from
  what to me are the permissible paths of wrong-doing. Possibly I shall lose
  another."</p>

  <p>"But why that house?" asked Peter. "And why should a letter from me
  influence the tenants you are trying to dispossess?"</p>

  <p>Jo shrugged his shapeless shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>He looked at Peter for a long time.</p>

  <p>"You have never done time in Dartmoor, of course&mdash;it's a pity; it is
  a humanising experience. There was a man there&mdash;a German&mdash;one of
  the biggest smashers of his time &mdash;Egolstein."</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"You knew, of course. that he lived at Deeplands? I was in the village
  yesterday, and the gentleman who hires cars to the unsuspecting stranger
  informed me that he had told you. Egolstein and I worked in the same shop. He
  loved Deeplands; he wove about it a certain glamour which it probably does
  not deserve. To me it became synonymous with quiet and calm and restfulness.
  I admit I was shocked when I saw the place, but the illusion of its
  peacefulness appealed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marvellous." murmured Peter.</p>

  <p>"You think that I am pulling one, but I am not." Jo was earnest. or
  appeared earnest.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Egolstein, who died, as you know, in the prison hospital, gave
  me a dream to realise. It was terrible to find the house in the possession of
  a wicked old lady who drinks and her son who soaks. The first time I saw them
  she wanted to let the place; the second time she would not open the door to
  me, and the letter I sent her was answered with a rudeness which was
  unbecoming in one who has passed the meridian of life."</p>

  <p>He stopped and looked at Peter.</p>

  <p>"How can a letter from me help you?" Peter asked. "Is there any special
  potency in my name?"</p>

  <p>Jo shrugged again.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea there is." be said.</p>

  <p>What was behind this?</p>

  <p>Peter's mind was working quickly. He was receiving no very satisfactory
  reactions.</p>

  <p>"Who is the landlord?"</p>

  <p>Jo took a card from his pocket and laid it on the table. "That's the
  address&mdash;The Reverend William Walkier. He is a rural dean and rolling in
  money. It's a shame that such things should be, but there you are! We must
  take the world as we find it."</p>

  <p>Peter took up the card, read it, and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Give me twenty-four hours to think about it, and I will see what can be
  done."</p>

  <p>Jo Loless rose and stood hesitant for a minute. and then: "Be kind to me?"
  he said, and left with that cryptic request.</p>

  <p>Evidently the Reverend William Walkier was a gentleman of some substance.
  Not every rural dean can afford the luxury of a town house in Eton Place,
  even though that house is a flat. Peter discovered this from the directory of
  the south-west of London.</p>

  <p>He was sufficiently interested to make a call. For his own satisfaction he
  badly wished to solve the mystery&mdash;possibly two. Mr. Lesster had
  disappeared. A warrant had been issued for his arrest for manslaughter, but
  the matter had been dealt with by the local police and had not again come
  within the purview of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>He found the Rev. William Walkier a very charming, good-natured man, who
  confessed ruefully that he had more than his share of this world's goods, and
  admitted that he would be glad if Deeplands was off his hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have had an offer from Mr. Loless to rent the place with the idea
  of purchase, but I have been so bitten by one rascal who rented it that I am
  a little shy, and, moreover, my present tenant, Mrs. Lewing, shows no
  disposition to clear out. My would-be tenant, however, has told me that he
  would get a letter which would scare the lady out."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"Mine, I presume&mdash;or am I flattering myself?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Walkier smiled.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he is not likely to have his wishes fulfilled. I have heard from
  Mrs. Lewing, taking up the option which she has for another five years lease.
  I have just written off to Mr. Loless telling him what has happened; so I am
  afraid your letter will be unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"It would certainly be necessary, but it was never possible," said
  Peter,</p>

  <p>Two months later there came through an urgent call to Scotland Yard, and
  because Peter Dunn had some remote association with Deeplands he was called
  in.</p>

  <p>A mounted constable riding. on the edge of the Deeplands estate had seen a
  flash of light near the house. He was a local man and knew that both Mrs.
  Lewing and her son had left that morning for Brighton. He rode his horse
  through a gap in the hedge and galloped up to the mansion. As he did so, he
  saw the figure of a man slip into a plantation near the back of the house,
  and shouted to him. From the fact that the man broke into a run it was
  evident that he had no business there.</p>

  <p>The policeman made no attempt to pursue this suspicious-looking intruder,
  but, continuing to the house. he dismounted and made a brief survey. By the
  light of his pocket lamp he discovered that a pane of glass had been broken,
  a window sash raised and the shutters forced. Thinking there might be a
  caretaker in the house. he rang the bell, hut, receiving no reply, had ridden
  back and telephoned his report to the nearest police station.</p>

  <p>At this period there had been a number of country house robberies and
  Scotland Yard had been called in. Peter Dunn drove down to Deeplands, and,
  joining a local inspector, came to the house the same way as the robber.</p>

  <p>There was a considerable amount of silver in the untidy dining-room, and
  this had not been disturbed. One of the back doors had been unlocked and
  opened, they discovered&mdash;it was near this that the light had been
  seen.</p>

  <p>Their search of the house revealed nothing. except a number of rooms which
  were shut and locked, a considerable state of disorder and uncleanliness, an
  immense number of empty wine bottles. but nothing which gave the slightest
  clue to the intruder's identity, except that on one of the tables there was a
  small basket which contained the remains of a meal.</p>

  <p>In such a big and rambling house the search could only be brief and
  unsatisfactory, Peter was inclined to accept the theory of the local
  inspector that the thief "had been disturbed".</p>

  <p>Attempts to get into communication with Mrs. Lowing and her son
  failed&mdash;he learned this the next day by telephone.</p>

  <p>There was another and more important work for Peter&mdash;a big fur
  robbery in the East End of London.</p>

  <p>When he returned home that night, the butler, who admitted him, told him
  that there was a man waiting to see him.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who came a couple of months ago, sir &mdash;Mr.
  Loless."</p>

  <p>Peter frowned.</p>

  <p>"Loless? What does he want?"</p>

  <p>He had almost forgotten the existence of the confidence man.</p>

  <p>Jo was sitting in a deep armchair, thoroughly at home. He wore a lounge
  suit, and by the side of his chair was a small attache case. to which he
  waved his hand with a smile as Peter entered.</p>

  <p>"Foresight!" he said.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Loless smiled again.</p>

  <p>"I require an interpretation of the law," he said. "You will observe that
  I have come prepared for immediate arrest. Do you know the old Latin tag
  about a cobbler sticking to his last? I have departed from that excellent
  advice and have tried burglary."</p>

  <p>Peter looked at him with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Are you surrendering?"</p>

  <p>Jo nodded his head gracefully.</p>

  <p>"In a sense," he said. "Of course, the story of the malleable glass was a
  lie. It deceived most people, but it did not deceive you. I certainly wanted
  to scare her ladyship from her domain, because I was pretty sure she had
  something to be scared about. She and her son were drunk for a week after you
  paid them a visit. Can I have a drink?" Peter rang the bell, and no word was
  spoken until the servant had left the visitor with a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"I have been drinking steadily since yesterday morning," said Jo, sipping
  the amber liquor. "It is not as amusing as I thought it would be, but it does
  take away unpleasant memories,"</p>

  <p>"Well?" Peter was curious.</p>

  <p>"I was orderly in the hospital at Dartmoor," said Jo, "and attended
  Egolstein in his last moments. He told me that he had buried thirty thousand
  pounds' worth of currency in the cellar of his house, Deeplands. Very
  naturally I was anxious to secure that money, but in the meantime a new
  tenant had moved in and was difficult to shift. When they went off to
  Brighton&mdash;they are staying at 34 Lieland Crescent. by the way&mdash;I
  broke into the house."</p>

  <p>"You were the burglar?"</p>

  <p>Again Jo inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"There is a cellar, and underneath that another cellar. You will find the
  door behind a large packing case, and beneath <i>that</i> cellar Egolstein
  had buried his money. I dug down to it. I hate manual labour: it makes one
  hot and blisters one's hands: but thirty thousand pounds! It didn't want a
  great deal of digging, because somebody had already loosened the earth. I
  noticed the bricks had been replaced. When I searched...."</p>

  <p>The hand that lit his cigarette trembled a little.</p>

  <p>"Odd that they should have chosen the same place, eh?.... That poor young
  devil must have died or been murdered a year ago, but they kept it quiet. You
  will he able to determine the exact cause of death. As an embryonic medico. I
  should say he had been shot. The old lady held his power of attorney and a
  lot of blank cheques. The son used his motor-car and his licence. He had lost
  his own, you will find, through drunkenness."</p>

  <p>Jo sighed heavily as he threw his just lighted cigarette into the
  fireplace.</p>

  <p>"If I had been a heartless brute. I could have gone on digging and got the
  money; but I have my principles, Dunn. It is a nice point of law: do I get
  five years for burglary, or a large reward for discovering a couple of
  cold-blooded murderers?"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is water in the great Sahara Desert, and there is
  honour among thieves. Peter Dunn had never struck one of these remarkable
  oases, but he had been told about them by men to whom they were rare
  phenomena, not likely to be forgotten,</p>

  <p>There are certainly clean thieves and thieves which are not so clean, and
  into this latter category comes Roony Riall. When Sergeant Peter Dunn thought
  of Roony, he thought of snakes.</p>

  <p>Roony was suave, sleek, had glossy pomaded hair and whitish, manicured
  hands. He had forged a little, taken minor parts in great crimes, always
  keeping on the safety line, As a craftsman he was versatile. He had narrowly
  escaped conviction for an offence which, even to criminals, who, generally
  speaking, retain some respect for women, is abhorrent .</p>

  <p>Peter loathed sly men who can never look at you straightly. Therefore he
  loathed Roony, who smiled too readily and was glib-tongued. Nevertheless,
  being a police officer, Sergeant Dunn was compelled to have dealings with
  him.</p>

  <p>He drew the line at visits to his house, and when Roony called one night
  after dinner to impart certain information concerning a small jewel robbery
  in Bond Street, Peter told him just what was on his mind,</p>

  <p>"We are always glad to meet a squealer at Scotland Yard, he said, "but I
  don't want you here, Riall. I like to keep this place clean, and you are my
  idea of dirt. As a police officer I appreciate your information, but as an
  individual you have had a very narrow escape from being kicked into Berkeley
  Square. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Roony showed his white teeth in a smile. You might have thought be was
  being complimented.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly." he said. "I am afraid you are prejudiced, Sir Peter. I try in
  my own humble way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say humble'." snarled Peter. "It makes me sick!"</p>

  <p>He jotted down the particulars the man brought to him, but still Roony
  lingered.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever thought what a marvellous cop Dappy Lyon would be?" He
  ended the question with a wide grin. "I suppose that ten thousand pounds
  reward still holds good?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He referred to the reward which the Trust and Security Company had
  offered.</p>

  <p>"You had better write and ask," said Peter shortly, and then: "Have you
  worked with him?"</p>

  <p>Roony shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Never had the luck." he said,</p>

  <p>"He is rather particular, isn't he?" said Peter offensively.</p>

  <p>Roony smiled at the insult and chuckled to himself all the way through the
  hall, and was still chuckling When his unwilling host slammed the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>Peter had been engaged in relief duty when the Trust and Security
  Company's premises in Pall Mall were scientifically burgled. One of four men
  could have performed the operation, always excluding the possibility that it
  was the work of the continental crowd. And that possibility was rejected.
  Scotland Yard settled down to locate the four suspects, and of these Dappy
  Lyon was the most important.</p>

  <p>Exactly why he was called Dappy nobody knew: possibly it was the work of a
  descriptive reporter, who has a trick of covering men and things with
  picturesque labels. Likely enough it was a fight promoter who called him
  "Dapper Dick Lyon" in the period when Dappy was a featherweight, fighting for
  microscopic purses.</p>

  <p>Dappy he invariably was; invariably well dressed, a generous little man
  who gave no trouble to the police, would go a long distance out of his way to
  help a fallen friend (he once paid for the defence of a man who had done him
  as bad a turn as any man could). He had so many admirable qualities that it
  was remarkable that he should have followed the career he had chosen.</p>

  <p>If any man deserved to be called the master criminal&mdash;a title which
  invariably raises loud guffaws at Scotland Yard&mdash;it was Dappy. This
  foxy-faced little man, with a bulging forehead and not unpleasant Cockney
  accent, was near to being The Complete and Perfect Criminal.</p>

  <p>He had never been convicted, though he had been several times in the bands
  of the police. The historical details to be found in the Record Department at
  the Yard contained certain interesting information. He had served in the war,
  had risen to the rank of Corporal in the Corps of Royal Engineers, mining
  section. After his discharge he had worked for three years in the factory of
  a locksmith and safe-maker&mdash;Grindles. who supplied the strong-room doors
  for most of the banks. He was an exemplary workman, skilful, painstaking,
  ingenious. He never lost time; was popular both with workmen and employers.
  During the period he was so employed Grindles were making the doors for the
  Midland &amp; Southern Deposit vault. It is an undoubted fact that Dappy
  assisted in their erection. After they had been fixed he left the plant,
  giving as a reason the fact that he could not earn sufficient money to supply
  his needs.</p>

  <p>Within two months of his retirement the Midland &amp; Southern vault was
  opened and emptied. The exact amount that was lost nobody knows; it was
  considerably over a hundred thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>Dappy was pulled in when it was discovered that he had been working at
  Grindles. He had (it was believed) been concerned in a previous bank robbery.
  He was questioned closely and released for lack of evidence. "Released for
  lack of evidence" became a formula on the documents which made up his
  dossier.</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly Dappy who organised the mail train robbery between
  Southampton and London, when fifty thousand pounds' worth of bar gold was
  taken from the bullion van and dropped on to the permanent way through a hole
  cut in the floor, after the train had been slowed by a manipulation of the
  signals on the loneliest stretch of the road. It had not only been slowed,
  hut stopped, and the thief had time to drop down between the lines and make
  his escape before the manipulated signal fell and allowed the train to
  proceed on its way.</p>

  <p>He chose his men well, probably imported a few of them, paid them
  munificently, and made no error until he fell in love. Then his mistake
  almost proved his undoing. This happened about three weeks after Peter's
  interview with Mr. Roony Riall.</p>

  <p>Dappy hadn't much use for women, never used them in any of his coups. He
  would as readily have fallen for the fat woman in a circus as for Canadian
  Lil, but, unhappily for him, he did not know Canadian Lil even by name. Her
  reputation was local to the town of Buffalo, though she had operated as far
  west as Cincinnatti and Chicago, Roony Riall had met her in Detroit during a
  fleeting visit he paid there. She came to England in response to his urgent
  cablegram, sweetened by a bank draft that paid expenses, and he met her at
  Southampton where the boat docked.</p>

  <p>"'There's fifty thousand dollars in this," he told her, "and we cut two
  ways."</p>

  <p>Decoy was no new role to Lil. It was the main staple of her business. She
  was very lovely, golden-haired, fair-skinned, modest of manner. She had
  planned to go to London and had already booked her room at a fashionable
  hotel</p>

  <p>"You can get that idea out of your nut," said Roony. "You'll stay
  at&mdash;" He gave her the name of a less pretentious hotel in a Midland city
  which Dappy frequented for reasons best known to himself.</p>

  <p>So it happened that one day, travelling to London, Dappy, found himself in
  a first-class compartment with the lovely Miss Mortimer from Philadelphia.
  She was doing Europe in a quiet, inexpensive way, Her father had a small
  store and she intended staying at a small hotel off the Strand. She told him
  all this and a great deal more.</p>

  <p>Dappy was a kindly soul. It was a pleasure for him to help any woman.
  Being human, the pleasure was intensified by the fact that she was very sweet
  and very lovely.</p>

  <p>Within a month they were engaged to be married. A honeymoon trip to Como
  was planned, and a villa was secretly rented by Dappy, who was anxious to
  impress her with his wealth.</p>

  <p>In justice to Lil it must he said that she had no idea that Dappy was a
  very rich man. She regarded disloyalty to money as one of the cardinal sins
  of her profession. To her, Dappy was a crook living on the edge of
  comfort&mdash;that and no more.</p>

  <p>As for Dappy, he was almost a reformed character; Miss Mortimer was the
  centre of a new universe. Even when they met Roony by accident in the Strand
  he was not suspicious of her real character. Later....</p>

  <p>"It is a curious thing," said Roony. "I recognised that little lady the
  moment I saw her, Her father has a store. . ."</p>

  <p>Dappy knew Ronny slightly. His reputation was not good, but, being in
  love, he warmed towards a man who was so full of praise for his fiancée. Out
  of friendliness grew confidence. Roony was given a job and the offer of a
  generous reward.</p>

  <p>On a certain night the wheel of his car came off in the Acton Road. The
  accident occurred where two policemen met at the end of their beats.</p>

  <p>This was the occasion of the classic robbery of the Acton Branch of the
  Leamington &amp; London Bank. On that night the vaults of the bank held a
  large sum of money due to liquidate the pay-rolls of several big factories in
  the neighbourhood. At four o'clock in the morning a policeman tried the door
  of the bank, found it open, went in and discovered the night watchman tied
  hand and foot in a small sound-proof telephone booth.</p>

  <p>He might have discovered this at an earlier hour, but the motor-car
  accident so carefully arranged had detained him.</p>

  <p>The watchman could give very little information as to how he came to be in
  this position. He was uninjured (this was characteristic of Dappy's method)
  except that his arm bore the marks of several punctures where the hypodermic
  needle had been used on him. He only remembered a cloth being drawn over his
  head and his being pulled to the ground. Beyond that his memory was
  vague,</p>

  <p>Dappy was in London, entrenched behind his inevitable alibi. and
  considerably strengthened by a new police regulation. introduced through some
  parliamentary busybodies, which prevented certain questions being asked of a
  suspect. There was no evidence on which he could be detained, but at night he
  was never left unshadowed.</p>

  <p>Roony came to Scotland Yard after a long telephone parley; in effect he
  arrived under the white flag of the informer, and, although his information
  was sketchy and there were gaps in the story he had to tell, the chief
  believed him.</p>

  <p>One evening Peter followed Dappy into a Soho restaurant and sat at his
  table. The little man looked up and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Got a gun, Dappy?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I never as much as owned one," be said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"You're coming for a little walk with me," said Peter; "and I'd like to
  carry your baggage."</p>

  <p>Dam's face twitched.</p>

  <p>"You've made a mistake, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's a cop," he said. "I think we've got you tight this time. If you are
  wise, you will stand your trial for the Trust &amp; Security company affair
  as well."</p>

  <p>A police car was awaiting them when they went out, and ten minutes later
  Dappy sat with four detectives.</p>

  <p>He had been betrayed, he knew that. Somebody had squealed on him, and the
  situation was a desperate one. He never suspected Roony till the motor-car
  accident was mentioned, and then he did not suspect&mdash;he knew.</p>

  <p>"Roony Riall, eh? Well, you've got to prove it, gentlemen, and I don't
  think you can. The only thing I'd like to ask you"&mdash;he addressed
  Peter&mdash;"is that my young lady should know nothing about this."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled and shook his head,</p>

  <p>"What your young lady doesn't know about this isn't worth knowing," he
  said. "She is a friend of Riall's&mdash;a little more than a friend. I should
  imagine."</p>

  <p>They told him the truth brutally, thinking it would break him. He heard
  for the first time the true history of Canadian Lil. Peter saw his face go
  white and he was silent.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew better than the men who questioned him that, even with the
  evidence of the squealer, he could not be convicted unless he convicted
  himself, but he was steadfast in his refusal to hand himself over to his
  enemies.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty certain that the stuff is buried somewhere," said the chief.
  "Dappy is a born mole&mdash;he got a Distinguished Conduct Medal in the war
  for his mining work: he knows more about blasting than most miners, and
  you'll probably find that somewhere in England is a real Ali Baba's
  cave."</p>

  <p>But if there was, Dappy was blandly ignorant of its existence.. More
  likely, if a search had been made of the coastwise barges that went down
  London river by night and put into Ostend with loads of English brick, the
  police might have touched lucky: hut nobody knew till years after that Dappy
  had three barges and a wharf of his own, and then the information came a
  little too late to be of much use.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was true, as the chief said, that he was a great digger
  and was an expert in the use of high explosives,</p>

  <p>They searched his lodging without result. Every railway parcels office
  came under examination. Peter, who was in control of one of these search
  parties, never expected to find the evidence he sought. No man organised the
  disposal of his stuff so efficiently as Dappy.</p>

  <p>Peter sent for Roony Riall, who came to his office. Roony was less
  confident than he had been.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I was in it, sergeant, I wouldn't own that unless it was true,
  would I? He worked four-handed, had two men down from Birmingham, and there
  was a sea-fearing fellow who drove the big car. I only saw him and Dappy. No.
  I don't know the names of the others. After the bust he went straight to his
  hotel. You found his car?.... Well, maybe the stuff is under the seat."</p>

  <p>He looked a little anxious. Peter thought, and then his uneasiness was
  expressed in words.</p>

  <p>"Does he know I've squealed?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded, and to his surprise Roony was not distressed.</p>

  <p>"Does he know about Lil?"</p>

  <p>There was something in his voice which arrested Peter's attention.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he said,</p>

  <p>"She'd get it out of him in a couple of days," said Roony eagerly. "He's
  mad about her!"</p>

  <p>It was then that Peter realised that he and his fellow questioners had
  probably committed a bad blunder when they had played Lil,</p>

  <p>"She's in this squeak with me." Roony went on eagerly. "We split the
  reward."</p>

  <p>"It looks as though there will be a whole lot to split," said Peter
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but release Dappy Lyon. He could have been charged
  on suspicion and a remand granted, but if, at the end of the remand period,
  the police could offer no further evidence, there would be a discharge and
  the failure of Scotland Yard would by emphasised.</p>

  <p>Dappy was released from detention. It was remarkable that he did not
  employ a lawyer, and contributed nothing but his inhibitions to his
  salvation,</p>

  <p>On the night he was freed Peter saw him in the West End, and, to his
  amazement. Lil was with him. She walked a little way from them When Peter
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I am not believing that story about Miss Mortimer," said Dappy. "She has
  been bringing, food to me ever since I have been inside&mdash;she's a woman
  in a thousand."</p>

  <p>Peter sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"It must he easy to be a master criminal, with brains like yours!" he
  said.</p>

  <p>Dappy, spent a week in or about London and the girl seemed to he with him
  every minute. They used to go for long motor-car drives together into the
  country&mdash;and a flying squad car, in some disguise or other, was never
  far behind.</p>

  <p>One morning Dappy surprised them. He came out driving a newer and a faster
  car, and outdistanced his shadows heading northward. He was seen passing
  through Woodford. An hour later the officers were holding a consultation in
  the town of Epping, when he appeared. Where he had been in the meantime
  nobody knew.</p>

  <p>They searched his car but found nothing. That same week he left England
  for the Continent and Miss Mortimer went with him.</p>

  <p>As a matter of precaution Roony Riall had been kept under observation
  until Dappy disappeared. For there were odd stories told about this mild
  little man.... he was a killer, some people insisted. though Scotland Yard
  could never connect him with anything as romantic as murder.</p>

  <p>Peter, being what he was, had no use for men who saw in crime of any sort
  the least hint of romance. He was trained in the traditions of the Yard, and
  the Yard, in the eyes of its staff, is not a place where unusual things
  happen.</p>

  <p>If you asked the oldest inhabitant what were the most remarkable
  happenings within his memory, he would (after long thought) cite the
  inspector who cut his finger with a piece of glass and fainted, or the day
  the Commissioner's dog bit the clerk in the Records Department, or possibly
  the occasion when half the staff went sick through eating bad fish.</p>

  <p>But of murderers who had sat in poky little rooms and told the stories of
  their villainies, of confessions signed with trembling hands, of great
  robbers who had detailed their coups to the chief, he would remember
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Peter went to Berlin to supply certain information about the brothers
  Poliski, and his visit had nothing whatever to do with Dappy and his
  misdeeds. In the red building on Alexanderplatz he exchanged reminiscences
  with men of his own profession, and told them how badly the central healing
  was run in London, whilst they in turn remarked upon the amazing stinginess
  of the Government in the matter of stationery.</p>

  <p>He was in Berlin for seven days, spending most of his time in the Criminal
  Museum. One day he was walking up Unter den Linden, ruminating upon the
  system of traffic control, when, coming towards him, he saw Dappy Lyon. Dappy
  wore an elegant fur coat, though the weather was warm, lemon-coloured gloves,
  and patent shoes, and swung a gold-headed cane. He paused to look into a
  jeweller's window. and when Peter passed him lie was humming "Ich liebe dich"
  sentimentally.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Dap!"</p>

  <p>Dappy looked round&mdash;was only mildly interested in the presence of the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"Doing Germany?"</p>

  <p>"I am just having a look round"&mdash;he waved his hand airily to embrace
  all Germany&mdash;"I have never been in this country before,"</p>

  <p>"Museums and what-nots." suggested Peter politely. "You should have a look
  at Police Headquarters&mdash;very interesting. There are a number of
  scientific burglars' tools which may be new to you."</p>

  <p>Dappy smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"No more of that for me, Mr.&mdash;Sir Peter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Call me sergeant," suggested Peter. "Let us be democratic in this
  republican land."</p>

  <p>"I have given up what I would describe as my career of crime," said Dappy.
  "I am getting married soon to one of the best girls in the world, and I'm
  going in for a motor-car agency. In fact, I am here in Berlin, seeing my
  representative, a fellow named Harry Brown,"</p>

  <p>"A good old German name that. One of the Browns of Brandenburg? Or is he a
  Non Brown of Silesia?" Dappy was amused,</p>

  <p>"He's got an office on Leipziger Strasse. telephones, clerks, everything."
  And then, as he saw the lift of the detective's eyebrows, he went on quickly:
  "He's not in Berlin just now&mdash;doing a bit of travelling, or I'd
  interduce you."</p>

  <p>"The loss is mine. Where are you staying?"</p>

  <p>Dappy named a hotel in Kurfürstendamm, where hotels are both good and
  expensive. He was quite at his ease, by no means perturbed at the outrageous
  appearance of one who, he had every right to expect, was hundreds of miles
  away. It struck Peter that he was neither uncomfortable nor alarmed, He was
  an innocent man, conscious of his temporary virtues.</p>

  <p>Peter went hack to the Adlon in a speculative mood, "The office" did not
  allow Adlon accommodation, but Peter never stinted himself in the matter of
  comfort. His first act was to put through a call to Dappy's hotel. He found,
  as he had expected, that the little man had spoken the truth. He was staying
  at the hotel and occupied a suite which could not have cost him less than a
  fiver a clay. And Miss Mortimer was living at the same hotel.</p>

  <p>Peter saw them driving in the Tiergarten in the cool of the evening, and
  he himself did not escape observation. "That's Dunn, isn't it?" asked the
  girl.</p>

  <p>Dappy nodded. He was toying with her hand absently. "The man who said I
  was . . a bad woman? Where did he get that nerve!"</p>

  <p>"Just trying to rattle me, my love," said Dappy. "He isn't a bad
  fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was not disposed to discuss so uninteresting a matter as Peter Dunn,
  and came back to the subject that his appearance had interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I never did believe you were a burglar, Dicky," she said. "And even if
  you were, why shouldn't you be? Pa always says that property isn't
  distributed like it should be. I wouldn't mind if you were a
  crook&mdash;really! But I know, of course, that you are not. How could you
  have got rid of all that jake&mdash;money, I mean&mdash;Pa always calls it
  jake&mdash;without the police knowing? You would have to be a mighty clever
  burglar to do that!"</p>

  <p>The bait of crude flattery had been cast in front of him before. This time
  he bit.</p>

  <p>"Oh, wouldn't I? You don't know me! Listen, kid." He turned to her with
  sudden energy, "I don't know what this fellow Dunn is doing in Berlin. Maybe
  he has got something on me." He paused and frowned. "If I thought so Id tell
  you something." He patted her hand. "I don't want my little girl to be left
  without money. I've got twelve thousand pounds&mdash;that's sixty thousand
  dollars&mdash;cached near London, and in case anything happens to me I am
  going to tell you just where it is. Sixty thousand dollars of real
  money!"</p>

  <p>She was breathing quickly. He was easier than she thought.</p>

  <p>"You'd find it, because I have got the whole thing laid out."</p>

  <p>He lowered his voice, although there was nobody to hear him, except the
  taxicab driver, who certainly spoke German and probably spoke Russian.
  "Remember how you and me went sweet-hearting to that wood&mdash;Epping
  Forest?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Remember my carving the letters of our names on that big tree?"</p>

  <p>She nodded again, She could find the place blindfold. It was a little off
  and close to a side road, and the tree stood in the centre of a grassy
  clearing: the names had been cut largely, if awkwardly, and between them an
  odd-looking triangle which was designed for a heart.</p>

  <p>"It is at the foot of that tree, You couldn't miss it." And then,
  unexpectedly: "Are you fond of Roony?"</p>

  <p>She was fonder than she would admit, for Mr. Roony Riall had been very
  attentive since she came to England. They, too, had planned a little trip
  together.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that idea?" she said scornfully, "I have got one boy in
  this whole wide world, and that's my Dicky."</p>

  <p>Dappy sighed&mdash;she hoped happily.</p>

  <p>He had some work to do and left her in the sitting-room, telling her he
  would be out for at least two hours.</p>

  <p>He was hardly out of the hotel before "Miss Mortimer" went to the
  telephone and put through a London call. It was half past ten in the evening,
  which is half past nine in London, and the line was clear; she was through to
  Roony in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"Got it?" said his anxious voice. "My God, you never have! Did he tell you
  about the Trust and Security&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trust nothing!" she answered brusquely. "Get a paper and put this down.
  Sixty thousand for the lifting! You know the main road to Epping through that
  wood? That's right, Epping Forest. You come to a cross road and then turn to
  the right...."</p>

  <p>Her instructions were very explicit and not to be mistaken. Roony Riall
  wrote feverishly, and read back to her the instructions she had given....</p>

  <p>At that moment Dappy was in Peter Dunn's sitting-room at the Adlon. There
  was a whisky and soda on the table before him and he was being
  confidential.</p>

  <p>"I am leaving her. sergeant; in fact, nay baggage is at the station. I
  don't think that Miss Mortimer and me will get on together. No, I'm playing
  fair&mdash;I never left a woman flat in my life. I hare paid the hotel hill
  and stuck five thousand marks under her pillow. A bachelor I live and die,
  sergeant. Women can be useful, but not in my line of business."</p>

  <p>"When are you going?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth&mdash;tonight," replied Dappy. He smiled faintly.
  "Clever fellow, Roony Riall, cleverer than me!"</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that night an Essex policeman saw a car turn from the
  main Epping road and stop a little distance down a side road. He watched the
  car for some time, but it was too dark to see the man who alighted, and, with
  the aid of a hand-lamp, made a search for a certain tree. Later the policeman
  saw the flash of the lamp. and was walking towards it, when he saw a flash of
  white flame and felt the shock of a terrific explosion that almost blew him
  off his feet. When he recovered balance and wits, he ran in the direction of
  the sound.</p>

  <p>There was a big hole at the foot of the tree. The force of the explosion
  had stripped away the bark, and with it certain initials carved
  sentimentally. Three policemen searched all night to find fragments of an
  unknown man who had exploded the mine which an ex-corporal of engineers had
  so skilfully buried.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOURS, sir, most be an interesting profession," said
  Skipper.</p>

  <p>He invariably made some such fool remark and Peter Dunn as invariably
  answered according to his folly. One cannot be unkind to a butler, for
  butlers out of their native element are helpless creatures. Mr. Harrivay's
  butler, who frequently came to Peter's house with urgent letters from his
  master, and sometimes from his mistress, was one of those men who might very
  easily be hurt. He was a large man, with a big, solemn face embellished with
  side whiskers, and he was talkative. That was the only black mark against him
  in Peter's book, for he was one of those incessant talkers whose conversation
  never showed a crack into which a wedge of interruption might be thrust.
  Mainly he talked about his butler's experiences in America.</p>

  <p>"It's a country I never wish to go back to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes." Peter was a little impatient with the messenger that spring
  morning for he was a busy man, "Take this note to Mrs. Harrivay. "</p>

  <p>He did not dislike Skipper&mdash;nobody disliked Skipper. He was one of
  those negative people entirely without personality that can be very
  exhausting to the objective mind. He was one of Stanley's discoveries: he had
  been found penniless and dishevelled through the prosaic instrumentality of a
  labour exchange. Stanley got him cheap and was immensely proud of his
  find.</p>

  <p>"The poor devil had been years in hospital and was down and out," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He would have died of starvation if he had had to live on the wages that
  Mr. Stanley Harrivay paid him.</p>

  <p>Skipper repaid his employer with sleepless service and a devotion which
  Stanley, who was not original, described as doglike.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Harrivay is well?" asked Peter, politely, as he sealed the
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinarily well, sir," said Skipper, gravely. "In the eighteen
  months I have had the honour of serving him I have never known him to be so
  well. He had a slight cold in July. I think it was on the 23rd that he began
  to sneeze&mdash;it may have been the 24th...."</p>

  <p>"I accept the 23rd," said Peter,</p>

  <p>"Thank you. sir." said Skipper, gratefully, and bowed himself out.</p>

  <p>Stanley Harrivay was a cousin of Peter Dunn. a fact which he did not
  emphasize until Peter inherited the title and fortune of his grandfather. If
  the truth be told, Mr. Harrivay had not been without hope that the
  estrangement between old man Dunn and his grandson would be permanent. The
  title must, of course, go to Peter, but the big money could he willed
  anywhere&mdash;and why not to himself, who, next to Peter, was in the direct
  line of succession? Peter became a common policeman as all the world knows,
  and eventually was promoted to a sergeantcy in the Criminal Investigation
  Department. It was rather low of him, as Mr. Stanley Harrivay said in the
  course of a letter to his elderly relative. Until this rash act he had been
  quite friendly with Peter, had sent him solid presents on his birthday: Peter
  had spent week-ends at Felbourne Manor and at least one Christmas week.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harrivay was comfortably circumstanced. He was, in truth, a fairly
  rich man, but fairly rich men are usually ambitious to be very rich men, and
  the possibility of the Dunn million coming his way brought about a
  considerable change in Mr. Harrivay's attitude towards his cousin. And when
  "that fellow Peter" became "Sir Peter" and it was discovered that he had
  taken with the title all the worldly possessions of his grandfather. Mr.
  Harrivay was not only surprised but deeply hurt.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, his was the first letter congratulating the heir upon his
  fortune.</p>

  <p>"After all," said Mr, Harrivay to his wife. "Peter is one of that kind of
  fellows who may never marry; I am his nearest relation and&mdash;well, you
  never know what might happen."</p>

  <p>So Peter was invited again to Felbourne Manor, which was near High Barnet,
  to spend his week-ends. And Peter replied politely that he would be delighted
  to come, but unfortunately he was on duty during the week-end&mdash;in fact,
  during all week ends.</p>

  <p>He was invited for Ascot week&mdash;the Harrivays had a box. Peter replied
  that it was a tragedy that he was on duty during the Ascot week.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harrivay, who was not easily daunted, asked him to lunch with him at
  the Carlton, and Peter accepted this compromise.</p>

  <p>He did not like Stanley Harrivay, who was a thin, querulous man, sandy and
  bald. He did not like his big feet, or his knock knees, or his habit of
  quarrelling with waiters and sending dishes back to the chef because they
  weren't cooked to his liking.</p>

  <p>He did like Mrs. Harrivay, who was younger and prettier than her husband,
  and who, in the days of his disgrace, had sent him nice letters and an offer
  of a secret allowance. Stanley never knew that they had lunched together with
  great frequency, and that Peter was the repository of her confidences.</p>

  <p>Skipper, the butler, had brought an urgent note from Stella. She wished to
  see him and would call at the house in Berkeley Square for tea.</p>

  <p>Peter disentangled himself from an important conference he was to have
  attended at Scotland Yard, and hurried home to meet her.</p>

  <p>The afternoon post had brought him a very correctly worded invitation from
  his cousin to spend the week-end at Felbourne.</p>

  <p>"I want you to meet a very interesting fellow&mdash;an American doctor,"
  wrote Stanley, and went on to describe the qualities and peculiar attractions
  of his guest.</p>

  <p>Peter had already invented his excuses when he reached his house to find
  his pretty relative awaiting him.</p>

  <p>He had a shock when he saw her: she looked tired and drawn.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't been sleeping well. I wanted to see you about that.... I
  mean the cause, but it is so silly that I don't think I will. Has Stanley
  asked you to Felbourne for the week-end? Don't come! You'll he bored to
  death: one of Stanley's odd friends will be staying with us, a doctor he met
  in New York last summer."</p>

  <p>"A psychiatrist?" Peter consulted the letter of invitation. "Stanley says
  he is an authority on crime&mdash;that put me off."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"We met him in town last week. He is a Dr. Fifer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fifer? Not Cornelius Fifer? Good Lord!" Peter looked at the letter again,
  "He didn't mention the name. Yes, I know Fifer very well by repute. I am
  lunching with him today: he is in charge of a criminal lunatic institution
  somewhere in America."</p>

  <p>Stella made a little face.</p>

  <p>"It is going to be a horrible week-end," she said. "He is bringing down
  his photographic albums&mdash;you know how morbidly interested Stanley is in
  these dreadful things."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether Stanley interests him as a psychiatrist or as an
  individual?"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly at this.</p>

  <p>"That's not very kind: you know Stanley&mdash;he does manage to impress
  scientists: he took up the study of criminology after he lost his interest in
  the breeding of Angora rabbits."</p>

  <p>She would have changed the conversation, but he detected something odd in
  her tone, in the very abruptness with which she turned to another topic, and
  questioned her.</p>

  <p>"Well..." she hesitated. "I <i>am</i> nervy. I had a horrid experience
  last night. Perhaps Stanley thinks I am mad too. I really came to ask your
  advice."</p>

  <p>She had heard movements in her room and had wakened in time to see a
  blurred silhouette against the moonlit corridor.</p>

  <p>"Stanley," suggested Peter, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He sleeps in the next room. Stanley snores dreadfully. I could hear him
  through the wall. It must have been a burglar. I found my handbag on the
  floor. It was open," "Nothing gone?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing.... At least, only Dr. Fifer's letter which Stanley had given me
  and which I had put in my bag. A burglar would hardly break into one's house
  to steal a letter. I screamed: it did not wake Stanley, but it frightened the
  burglar. Skipper heard me and came down. He wanted to wake Stanley, but I
  wouldn't have that. It was Skipper who found the handbag on the floor near
  the bed."</p>

  <p>"Can anybody get admission to the house'?" asked Peter. "I mean, any of
  the servants who sleep outside?" She thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten that. Yes&mdash;the chauffeur. He is not a good chauffeur,
  but Stanley knew his grandfather. You know how odd he is in choosing
  servants."</p>

  <p>Peter thought quickly.</p>

  <p>"I will come down on Saturday morning," he said, "unless this fellow bores
  me at lunch, in which case I won't come down at all."</p>

  <p>But Dr. Fifer did not bore him. He was a tall, gaunt man, and his beard
  was more grey than black. He was an easy man to entertain. for he talked most
  of the time and was only content to listen when Peter described the methods
  of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"You have no psychiatrist? Well, I should not like to say you are wrong. A
  lot of psychiatry is bunk. You can't always get the mental slants of convicts
  by making, them draw squares and triangles and by getting them to find their
  way out of a picture maze. You can get them by listening to them, encouraging
  them to talk, kidding their vanities&mdash;and they have got plenty of
  them.&mdash;Take poisoners&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am the last authority on the mind of the poisoner," he said, and told
  the doctor the story of Mr. Greeley Bletsall, which was his last big
  case.</p>

  <p>Dr Fifer listened keenly, keeping up a rapid fire of questions.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I can do one worse than that! By the way, you will have another
  poison case in your hands: they run in twos. Gas suicides run in fours,
  crimes of jealousy in threes.... It's odd, but there it is. There is a law
  governing such rhinos. I had a man in my institution who poisoned his
  mother-in-law, his wife, the family doctor and a United States sheriff, a
  fellow named Roanby&mdash;an Englishman. He was turned over to an institution
  in Massachusetts after I had him a year. By no test was he mad. In fact, I
  was the only psychiatrist who gave evidence on his behalf&mdash;I saved him
  from the death penalty. Poisoners. as a rule, are the sanest murderers that
  ever come before a judge&mdash;I believe this fellow was mad. He was my pet
  patient and I hated like hell losing him. Ingenious? He was diabolically
  clever! In one of the murders he used whisky&mdash;wood alcohol stuff.
  Naturally, the coroner said 'misadventure'...."</p>

  <p>Peter looked forward to meeting the psychiatrist during the week-end. He
  was fated to see him&mdash;but not alive. Dr. Fifer arrived on the Friday
  afternoon at Felbourne Manor, and he was not in the best of tempers: when
  taking his overcoat and suitcase from the car in which he arrived, Skipper
  dropped the doctor's glasses on the ground and smashed them, and without his
  glasses he was a blind man.</p>

  <p>"I never wear them when I am travelling," he snapped (Stanley was trying
  to suggest methods by which the misfortune might have been avoided). "I sleep
  in cars: only idiots look at scenery. If your servant had not been the
  biggest fool&mdash; However. it doesn't matter: I can get a pair from my
  hotel. How they fell out is a mystery. I have a special pocket for my
  glasses."</p>

  <p>The spare pair arrived by special messenger after dinner, and with them
  the messenger brought a number of letters which had arrived by the mail. It
  was after reading these that his manner changed; he scarcely spoke, seemed to
  Stella to grow nervous. He asked Stanley Harrivay if it was possible to
  telephone to Boston, and if there was a telephone in his bedroom (there was,
  in point of fact, an extension). At ten o'clock that night his call came
  through. From that hour he did not leave his room, the door of which he had
  locked, except to come out for a few minutes and bawl a good-night in his old
  manner, before he retired for the night.</p>

  <p>His bedroom was next to Stanley's. who heard him moving about; heard him
  again at half past seven the next morning. Each room at Felbourne Manor had a
  bathroom attached. Two bathrooms, that of Stanley and the doctor's. had a
  communicating door. which was locked and bolted on both sides.</p>

  <p>Stanley heard him "pottering about", as he subsequently put it, in the
  bathroom, and a little later the click of the lock turning. Stanley shouted
  'Good-morning' through the closed door. He heard the doctor growl something
  and then:</p>

  <p>"How do you own this faucet?"</p>

  <p>It was then that the host remembered that the cold water tap of the wash
  basin was out of order. If you knew the trick of it, it was easy to turn.
  Stanley bawled his instructions through the door. Apparently the doctor tried
  to turn on the cold water, but unsuccessfully.</p>

  <p>"All right. all right," he boomed testily. "I am taking a bath so it
  doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>He heard the bath taps turned off, then the clink of glass against glass.
  Almost immediately after he heard a roar of pain and the thud of a heavy body
  falling. He tried to get through into the bathroom, but the door was bolted.
  Flying out of his room he made an unsuccessful attempt to get in through the
  doctor's bedroom. Not only that, but the bathroom was locked. It was a
  quarter of an hour before the doors were broken open and Dr. Fifer's dead
  body was discovered.</p>

  <p>The news come through to the Yard whilst Peter was in his office, and he
  was the first to jump from the police car when it drew up under the portico
  of Felbourne Manor. Stella was waiting to receive him, for he had 'phoned her
  that he was coming. He expected to had her hysterical, but she was calm, and
  her voice was steady. She alone of the household was able to give a coherent
  account of what had happened.</p>

  <p>Stanley, who had made his appearance almost immediately, was in a pitiable
  state of collapse.</p>

  <p>"It's a terrible thing to have happened.... Such a clever man. I'm sure it
  is suicide. Has Stella told you. My God, it's awful!"</p>

  <p>It was some time before Peter could get Stella alone, and then he heard as
  much of the story as she could tell.</p>

  <p>He went upstairs and saw the unfortunate man. He was lying on the bed and
  was still wearing his pyjamas. The police surgeon who had examined into took
  Peter by the arm and led him outside.</p>

  <p>"If this isn't a case of cyanide poisoning I've never seen one?" he said.
  "I should think it's a very ordinary suicide, but we'll be able to tell
  accurately the cause of death in a few days."</p>

  <p>Peter returned to the bedroom. It was a big apartment, comfortably
  furnished, and leading out was the bathroom, where the body had been found.
  On a table were laid out the dead man's shaving kit and such articles of
  toilet, hairbrush, comb, etc., as he might require. The detectives who had
  searched the room had not found any sign of poison. There was a water bottle,
  on a glass shelf. It was three parts full, and over it was an inverted
  glass.</p>

  <p>When the bathroom door had been forced the cold water faucet in the
  wash-basin was running.</p>

  <p>"We found this." said the divisional inspector, who came in whilst Peter
  was examining the room. It was in the pocket of his dressing gown, which was
  hanging up behind the door."</p>

  <p>'This' was an automatic pistol, the magazine of which contained nine
  cartridges, the tenth being in the chamber.</p>

  <p>"The safety catch isn't up. It looks as though he was expecting to use it
  at any moment. Here are some papers we found in the wastepaper basket,"</p>

  <p>The 'papers' were Cable forms. On each had been written an address "Saline
  Boston" and a few words of an unfinished &mdash;message.</p>

  <p>The first ran:</p>

  <p class="note"><tt>"In case cannot reach you by 'phone want you check up
  Walter Roanby...."</tt></p><br>

  <p>The second began:</p>

  <p class="note"><tt>"Check whereabouts Roanby English poisoner transferred
  1926...."</tt></p><br>

  <p>The third was illegible for the words had been erased.</p>

  <p>On the dressing table were the letters the dead man had received the night
  before, and Peter read them through. To his surprise they were business
  letters, none of which contained the least excuse for the perturbation which
  the doctor had shown after reading.</p>

  <p>Peter went into the bathroom and examined every object carefully. If the
  man had committed suicide he was certain he would find the bottle or carton
  which contained the poison. Even if it had been in pellet shape it would have
  had some wrapping. There was nothing of this character. He went down to the
  servants' quarters and interviewed Skipper.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, no servant went to his bedroom this morning. He did not have
  morning tea or anything else. In fact, he told the mistress he did not
  require it."</p>

  <p>After the body had been removed, Peter made another search of the room.
  Who was Walter Roanby? The English poisoner who was transferred
  to&mdash;Massachusetts! It was at that moment that Peter connected the dead
  man's reminiscences with the murder. But evidently the cables had been begun
  before the telephone message from Boston carne through,</p>

  <p>Before he was connected with the Transatlantic telephone, Peter put an
  inquiry through to London, and whilst be was examining the room, he was
  called by the central service who gave him the Boston number that the doctor
  had asked for on the previous night.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch: it was eleven o'clock&mdash;that would be six
  o'clock in the morning in Boston, and the line would be fairly clear. He
  repeated the number and made an urgent request for immediate connection.
  Whilst he was waiting for this, he continued his search, and reread the
  letters that had come by the messenger from London. They were very ordinary
  business letters, that from America being about the doctor's new book, and
  requesting an elucidation of some passage which was not clear to the
  printers' reader.</p>

  <p>He went into the bathroom and again inspected its contents. The inverted
  glass over the water bottle interested him. He felt the inside&mdash;it was
  quite dry. The communicating door between the doctor's bathroom and Stanley's
  had been unlocked, and he passed through. The toilet furnishings were
  identical. There was the same glass and the same bottle, but unlike the
  bottle in the doctor's bathroom, this one was full, and the inverted glass
  was wet. There were drops of water on the outside of the bottle where it had
  drained.</p>

  <p>He went out into the corridor and called Stanley.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I opened the communicating door. I unlocked mine and pushed the bolt
  back when I heard him fall. When I found him dead I unlocked his side of the
  door."</p>

  <p>"You haven't taken any water out of this bottle this Morning?"</p>

  <p>Stanley shook his head.</p>

  <p>Peter poured out a little drop of water from the doctor's bottle, put his
  finger in and tasted it. There was neither the smell nor the taste of
  cyanide, and the rough test made on the water, which had been sent to the
  analyst, brought him no nearer to the solution of the mystery, nor did he
  expect to find that the water was poisoned, he was still looking at the
  bottle when the telephone bell rang and. after a delay of a minute, a sleepy
  voice demanded his business in a strong American accent,</p>

  <p>By great luck he had reached the one man to whom he wished to speak, and
  the nine minutes' conversation be had was very illuminating,.</p>

  <p>Walter Roanby had escaped from the institution two years before and had
  disappeared,</p>

  <p>"The doctor was mad at us for not letting him know, but he has been
  travelling for two years&mdash;he went to China and India&mdash;and I guess
  he did not read any American newspapers. Yes, Roanby escaped&mdash;rode the
  train out of Boston to Philadelphia. He was seen there and chased by a Yard
  cop. Went west, I believe; we've heard no more about him since."</p>

  <p>Peter asked a number of questions, only a few of which the institute
  superintendent could answer.</p>

  <p>"Clever? I should say he was! He escaped by drugging the guard: he got the
  drug out of the dispensary by soaking the corner of his handkerchief in
  morphine every time he came to the drug store, and collected it drop by
  drop."</p>

  <p>Peter had the doctor's overcoat brought to him. In one of the big, side
  pockets he found the spectacle case containing the smashed glasses. The case
  itself was crushed and mud-stained and bore the heel mark of the clumsy
  butler. Searching he found the place into which the case usually fitted, It
  was a narrow pocket on the left breast of the coat, and when Peter pushed in
  the flattened case, he found that it fitted tightly.</p>

  <p>Stanley Harrivay as a witness was entirely useless and it was to Stella
  that he turned for information.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember discussing the doctor at dinner?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There had been such a discussion she said,</p>

  <p>"Did you mention him by name?"</p>

  <p>Here she was to give him an emphatic answer.</p>

  <p>"No. Stanley has an exasperating memory for names, and could not tell
  me&mdash;he had left the doctor's letter upstairs in his room, and brought it
  downstairs just as I was going to bed, and I put it into my bag&mdash;it was
  rather a long letter and I wasn't terribly interested, but didn't want to
  hurt Stanley's feelings by skimming it in front of him."</p>

  <p>That evening Peter went to the local station and had a long conference
  with the division inspector and the police surgeon.</p>

  <p>At a quarter to seven, when Skipper was laying the table, he found the
  room suddenly filled with complete strangers. He made a fight, but not the
  fight he intended, because his hand was never left free to pull the gun he
  carried.</p>

  <p>"It was the tooth brush that put me on the track." explained Peter to his
  superior. "It was wet and there was no reason why it should be wet for the
  glass in which it should have been soaked was bone dry in spite of the fact
  that a glassful of water had been poured out. Fifer couldn't turn the tap or
  faucet as be called it. Yet it was running when Stanley noticed
  it&mdash;which was probably some time after the murder. Only a person
  acquainted with the cold water tap could have turned it on&mdash;that person
  was Roanby, or Skipper, as he called himself. The peculiar fact I noticed was
  that although the brush was wet, there was no toothpaste, but there was the
  leaden screw top of a paste tube. Somebody had removed the paste&mdash;the
  somebody who had washed the tooth brush. The poison was in the paste. We
  found the tube at the bottom of Skipper's trunk.</p>

  <p>"It was one of the unlikely chances of life that brought Fifer to the
  house. Skipper knew him well and hated him, though Fifer had testified to the
  prisoner's insanity at his trial, and it was his evidence that had saved the
  man from the chair. Skipper heard at dinner that a psychiatrist was coming,
  and, although the name was never mentioned, he had a feeling that it was
  Fifer. He saw Stanley Harrivay give a letter to his wife, and went into her
  bedroom that night to make absolutely sure that it was Fifer who was
  coming.</p>

  <p>"That he should regard the man who saved his life as an enemy may seem odd
  to those who do not understand a convict's attitude towards those in
  authority. The doctor meant exposure and, as Skipper believed, rearrest and
  extradition.</p>

  <p>"He had studied the doctor when he was an inmate of the institution. and
  knew his sight was poor. He told me that if Fifer recognised him he would
  have shot him on the spot. He had already staged an accident and had taken
  out and loaded Stanley's gun, and put it under the portico. But the doctor
  was not wearing his glasses, Skipper snatched the coat, jerked the glasses
  underfoot and broke them. He had made so careful a study of the doctor's
  habits that be knew exactly where the glasses would be. Anyway, it saved an
  unpleasant shooting accident.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, another pair of glasses was available. When he
  realised the game was up, he went upstairs, where he had laid out the
  doctor's kit, and injected cyanide into his tooth-paste with a hypodermic
  needle. He must have done this during the dinner.</p>

  <p>"Apparently the doctor did not use paste on his teeth overnight. Even then
  he hoped to escape recognition, but no sooner had Fifer put on his glasses
  than he recognised the man, though evidently he was not certain&mdash;hence
  the telephone message to Boston. But he was moody and silent after that. They
  thought it was because he had had bad news in the letters. The real reason
  was that he was almost certain that he was sleeping under the same roof as a
  desperate murderer. He slept with a gun under his pillow that night. It was
  found in his dressing-gown pocket.</p>

  <p>"The doctor could not turn on the tap, yet it was running. It was Skipper
  who, in the confusion following the discovery of the body, turned on the tap
  to wash the glass, and, passing through into Stanley's bathroom, substituted
  one for another."</p>

  <p>Walter Roanby, <i>alias</i> Skipper, was hanged at Pentonville Gaol. He
  had no psychiatrist to testify to his insanity, for the only man who believed
  he was mad was dead&mdash;had died at his own hands.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">SUPERINTENDENT LEIGH, of the Criminal Investigation
  Department, was a difficult man to please. The best job of work earned no
  more from him than a grunt which had in it an unnecessary amount of
  disparagement. It was a legend that if Mr. Leigh ever expressed his pleasure
  and approbation it would be his last conscious utterance on earth.</p>

  <p>He had never approved of Peter Dunn; but then, he had never approved of
  anybody. He told Peter he was a little too conspicuous in the service, and
  said this many times.</p>

  <p>"You're too confident, sergeant, too infernally sure. I don't say you're
  any worse than any young officer, but then policemen are like that nowadays.
  The old brand of discreet officer is dying out&mdash;in fact, is almost
  dead."</p>

  <p>Peter was sorry that it was not quite dead, but wisely he did not express
  this opinion.</p>

  <p>He certainly was conspicuous. Almost every policeman had heard of Peter,
  his fortune and his baronetcy. He had even excited the curiosity of Ann
  Kelski.</p>

  <p>She learned of Peter from Mike Leary. As a woman she was not unnaturally
  intrigued by the phenomenon of a titled policeman; as an artist she resented
  the respect with which her companion spoke of this officer.</p>

  <p>"All cops are dumb." she said, and felt that experience justified her
  contempt. She was a little slangy at that period, for she had been playing
  around with Mike and the Stack gang, who were one hundred per centers and had
  their haunts in wholesome American cities, some of which would have been glad
  to entertain the remainder of their bodies in the State gaol.</p>

  <p>Ann felt superior to policemen just then, for she had lifted a million
  mark pearl necklace from a store on Unter den Linden and had walked through a
  cordon of rubber. truncheoned policemen, with the pearls inside her neat
  little hat.</p>

  <p>Heredity counted with Ann. who was the daughter of the best jewel thief in
  two continents; she was by birth British, European by education, wholly
  dangerous, completely without scruples, clever.</p>

  <p>She came to London, spent three months at a fashionable hotel, then sent
  for Mike Leary to do a job which she had so carefully planned that even Mike,
  who was on the dumb side, could not possibly fall into error.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn stored in his head odd scraps of information concerning people,
  and the name of Ann Kelski was in a faint and elusive way oddly familiar.
  There are certain American publications which carry interesting articles on
  those criminals who operate exclusively on the continent of Europe. and it
  was through this medium that he had made a fleeting acquaintance with the
  ingenious Ann.</p>

  <p>There seemed little likelihood of his coming into personal contact with
  the "big shots" of the continental underworld, for these ladies and gentlemen
  usually give Great Britain a wide berth. But he did meet Mike Leary.</p>

  <p>"There's too much law in your dam' country and too much sea around
  it."</p>

  <p>Thus did Mike summarise the disadvantages of operating in England. And he
  said this in a moment of great bitterness and sincerity when, with handcuffs
  on his wrists and a strap about his ankles, he was being brought back from
  Dover by Peter Dunn to answer a charge of breaking into the Central Midland
  Bank. The strap was necessary, for Mike had made an attempt to leap from the
  window of the carriage in which he was travelling.</p>

  <p>He made no reference to Ann Kelski, and her name was not associated with
  the offence even when it was discovered that Mike carried none of the stolen
  property, which was remarkable, for the police had been hot on his scent. It
  was known that he had worked single-handed. He had been seen leaving the hank
  and had been chased. Peter, who had charge of the case, could account for
  almost every minute of the man's time, and there had been detectives on the
  boat train keeping him under observation, and every person who approached him
  or spoke to him had been detained at Dover and searched&mdash;everybody
  except the people who occupied the coupé at the end of the Pullman car. These
  were a middle-aged lady, accompanied by a gawky nurse-girl carrying a baby.
  The woman was questioned because Leary had stopped in the doorway to speak to
  the child.</p>

  <p>But nobody had dreamed of searching the baby. and it was in the shawl
  which swathed it that some seventy thousand pounds' worth of negotiable bonds
  went to France.</p>

  <p>Peter know only this about Ann Kelski, that she was personable, was
  British by birth, and for three years had been an actress in Paris. She had
  no English domicile, and save for his fleeting acquaintance with her in the
  American Press and the knowledge that she had served a term in a French
  prison. he had no exact knowledge of her. If a quarter-page drawing he had
  seen meant anything. she was beautiful; but drawings are apt to be deceptive
  when they are published in Sunday supplements, where all lady crooks are
  <i>ipso facto</i> beautiful.</p>

  <p>Mike Leary went down to the shades with the philosophical fortitude which
  is part of the professional's equipment. He gave no information about the
  stolen property, though it was hinted to him that a squeal that recovered the
  money would make quite an appreciable difference to the length of his
  sentence,</p>

  <p>It was natural that the newspapers should not forget that, though the
  robber had been convicted, the stolen money had not been found. A crime
  expert talked of a woman accomplice, and Peter very rashly expressed an
  opinion, which was printed.</p>

  <p>"The clever woman bank robber is a sheerly imaginative character. Women
  are decoys, swindlers, larcenists, but they are not clever enough to
  undertake work of this description."</p>

  <p>Peter-made this statement after a very irritating interview with Mr.
  Leigh. It was a statement (said that officer) which no policeman should make
  in any circumstances, and when Peter read it in print he was aghast at his
  own indiscretion. He accepted the inevitable official reprimand for
  "improperly and without consulting his superiors making an unauthorised
  communication to the Press" with patience and good humour.</p>

  <p>But the biggest kick of all had yet to come. Ann Kelski read his views and
  quivered with annoyance; she was that much feminine.</p>

  <p>Most of the things she said about Peter Dunn and the English police
  generally were unprintable, for she spoke worse languages than French, German
  and English. Some great artists are touchy and morbidly sensitive about the
  quality of their work, and the mildest criticism is resented. Ann was one of
  these. And really Mr, Dunn had offered her an injustice, for she was a
  brilliant woman, and "ingenious" is a pale word to empty when describing
  tricks of hers which were as clever as any devised by a modern magician, and
  impersonations which certainly outshone the applauded efforts of real
  actresses; for it was she who so successfully painted a cheque for a million
  francs and passed it at the Credit Lyonnais under the eyes and with the
  apparent approval of a rich and elderly admirer who had given her a cheque
  for ten thousand to buy a little present she desired. She had taken this
  near-sighted man to the bank, pushed the cheque to the teller, and, with the
  aid of a confederate who distracted the unhappy man's attention whilst the
  money was paid, walked out of the bank with her victim&mdash;and the
  money.</p>

  <p>It was Ann Kelski who cleared the stock of a Viennese jeweller by a trick
  so simple that to describe it in detail would be against public policy.</p>

  <p>"Peter Dunn&mdash;Sergeant Peter Dunn&mdash;say, what's the meaning of
  that 'Sir' in front of his name?"</p>

  <p>Somebody explained the mystery of the baronetage, but she was neither
  impressed nor interested, for titles meant nothing to her.</p>

  <p>She took herself to Cannes and spent a week interviewing likely assistants
  for the task she had in hand.</p>

  <p>"Leary was a had break. Done? Not done, but dead! I'd have asked you to do
  the job, Walter, but you were in Egypt."</p>

  <p>Walter Henkel grinned his appreciation of this compliment. He also was a
  clever man and a quick worker. It was no coincidence that Peter Dunn was
  acquainted with Mr. Aaron Baumstein, the diamond merchant. He had been
  working with the City police on a case which touched several wholesale
  jewellers but did not touch this gentleman at all, he discovered when he
  interviewed him. Mr. Baumstein was a thickset, shabby-looking man, who wore a
  slightly soiled collar and a shabby tie, and was worth two millions. He had
  his home in Maida Vale, and, to counteract his many admirable qualities, he
  had one weakness: he was a gambler in a modest way, and patronised a club
  near the Haymarket. There are such places in London&mdash;forbidden, it is
  true, by the police&mdash;but there are such places. He loved to sit for a
  couple of hours at a green board, happy in the knowledge that it was a
  perfectly straight game. and usually he rose a winner or a loser of a few
  pounds.</p>

  <p>It was in the club that Peter met him for the second time. Scotland Yard
  was making one of its periodical round-ups, and the club in question was
  raided. Mr. Baumstein, with the naivete of one who had been born in, and
  acquainted with the police methods of. other countries, asked that his name
  should be suppressed and offered a substantial bribe, which Peter very
  good-naturedly refused. "It doesn't matter about your name; there are
  hundreds of Baumsteins in London. Have you any other address than the one in
  Maida Vale and Hatton Garden?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Baumstein gave the address of his mother: but, though he was cheerful
  in the confidence that he had escaped identification, there wasn't anybody in
  Hatton Garden or Maida Vale who did not know that Mr. A. Baumstein of St.
  John's Wood was Mr. A. Baumstein of Maida Vale.</p>

  <p>Peter got to know him, and went to his office with greater interest
  because the little man was very proud of the fact that his was the only
  burglar-proof office in Hatton Garden. It had a fool-proof system of burglar
  alarms. After Mr. Baumstein had locked his office and the front door, it was
  impossible to walk across a room, much less open the window, without a shrill
  bell announcing to the constabulary of the City of London that there were
  unauthorised visitors to No. 608 Hatton Garden. "Some people spend their
  money on safes and vaults," said Mr. Baumstein. "I'm all for alarms. There
  isn't a safe in the world that one of these American smashers can't open. I'm
  speaking from experience."</p>

  <p>He could point with justification to the fact that three attempts had been
  made to enter his office and had failed. That scientific burglars should
  direct their attention to his premises was only natural: he carried a larger
  stock of big blue diamonds than any merchant in London. Peter saw them
  reposing in velvet cases in the steel safe in the front office.</p>

  <p>"If you touch that handle it rings; if you move that telephone an alarm
  rings; if you open any window in the building, nothing can stop the bell
  ringing. Suppose somebody conceals themselves on the premises&mdash;that's
  the way it's always done&mdash;they could hardly move a dozen steps without
  setting off the alarm."</p>

  <p>Peter was impressed.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten Mr. Baumstein, and was still aching from the Central
  Midland robbery, when he received a note. It was delivered by hand to his
  house in Berkeley Square and was written on the notepaper of the Ritz-
  Carlton.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Sir Peter Dunn,</p>

  <p class="letter">I wonder if you would care to see me this afternoon at four
  o'clock in my suite? I am rather thrilled by something I have discovered in
  France, which I think would interest you."</p><br>

  <p>It was signed "Millicent Clarke."</p>

  <p>It was not an uncommon name. He had a dim idea that he had met a Mrs.
  Clarke before somewhere, but could not place her. Nor, when he called that
  afternoon, did he recognise, in the very dainty lady who received him, any
  acquaintance that he could remember.</p>

  <p>She was rather pretty and voluble and important. He gathered that she was
  married and that her husband was not in England.</p>

  <p>"You'll think I am one of those busybodies who plague the police." she
  smiled. "Harry told me I should be snubbed for my pains, but it was such fun
  that I thought I'd write to you. Just wait one moment."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room and came back with a paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>"First of all. tell me if you know anything about that." Peter had no
  sooner glanced at it than he knew what it was: it was a bearer bond, one of a
  small denomination that had formed part of the loot that had been taken from
  the Central Midland.</p>

  <p>"How did you get this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> part of the robbery. isn't it?" she asked eagerly. "I read
  about it when I was in Monte Carlo, but I didn't suspect anything till I saw
  the little rubber stamp on the back. It is very faint&mdash;you can just see
  it. They evidently tried to get it out&mdash;Harry says with some kind of
  acid. It's true&mdash;this is part of the loot&mdash;is that the word?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>She was so obviously delighted by the confirmation of her suspicions that
  Peter found himself smiling in sympathy. He could afford to smile: out of the
  blue had come, from the most unexpected quarter, the one and only clue to the
  hiding place of the lost bonds.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too exciting! Harry&mdash;my husband is Harry Auburn
  Clarke&mdash;has been very sarcastic about me.... telling me I should be a
  detective. But it was the rubber stamp mark and the fact that somebody had
  tried to rub it away&mdash;I used a magnifying glass to find that&mdash;that
  made me think of the bank robbery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me how you came into possession of this bond?"</p>

  <p>Peter should have known better than to attempt to anticipate Mrs. Clarke's
  story. First of all she had to tell him what her husband had said and what
  she had replied; then she had to explain how on three separate occasions
  previous to this her husband had been emphatic on a point and she had been
  emphatically in opposition. and it had been proved that she was right.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn was human and was a good audience for any pretty woman. She
  came back from her digressions long before he began to feel any violent
  symptoms of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I met her at Monte Carlo&mdash;the woman who gave me this&mdash;Madame
  Kelsko or Kelski or some such same. She was beautifully dressed, rather
  pretty and very charming, She speaks English with a strong American accent.
  Isn't that wonderfully observant of me?"</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Ann Kelski became a real entity to Peter.
  Canvassing all the continental crooks he knew or had heard about, he had
  dwelt for a moment on this lady's name, had even gone to the Record
  Department to search for her history, but without result.</p>

  <p>"It was at a bridge party." the lady went on. "I'm afraid the stakes were
  high, and Mrs. Kelsko or whatever her name was, lost. I don't like taking
  I.O.U.'s from strangers, and they were such terribly bad players, and I was
  rather relieved when she asked me if I'd take a bearer bond for a hundred
  pounds and give her the change, which was about twenty-five. That night at
  dinner I met some of the people who were at the bridge party, but nobody
  seemed to know who she was or how she came to be invited to the house. It was
  Princess Chimiz Diliski's, and she does invite the oddest people. Then one
  day I went down to Marseilles to meet the boat which was bringing Harry back
  to France from India, and to my amazement I saw her. She was very poorly
  dressed and was walking quickly with a man. I was taking a short cut to the
  docks. and to my surprise they turned into one of those miserable looking
  houses you find near the water front in Marseilles. There was no number on
  the door, but I should recognise it."</p>

  <p>"Did you see her again?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No." She hesitated, and then, with a burst of frankness: "if you think
  there is anything, in it, I can show you the house. I'm going back to Monte
  Carlo the day after tomorrow to join my husband, and we could stop off at
  Marseilles. He'll send the car to meet us. I know the street&mdash;the Rue
  Mediterranean."</p>

  <p>To say that Peter was elated is to put the case judiciously. He was also
  intensely curious. He went back to Scotland Yard, walking on air, and told
  his story to the daily conference which was sitting. The chief examined the
  bond: a bank official was hastily summoned, and he was emphatic that this was
  part of the proceeds of the Central Midland robbery.</p>

  <p>Peter telephoned Mrs. Clarke from Scotland Yard and arranged to meet her
  at Victoria two days later. He spent the next clay collecting such papers as
  might be necessary to secure the arrest of Ann Kelski, and, if she were
  British, her extradition.</p>

  <p>That night occurred what Scotland Yard still regards as the classic crime
  of the century. At half past six a policeman was patrolling Hatton Garden. At
  that early hour the streets were thronged with people, the road occupied with
  vehicles, for Hatton Garden is a short cut between High Holborn and Gray's
  Inn Road. He was nearly opposite the premises occupied by Mr. Baumstein when
  he heard the deafening note of the burglar alarm. It was fixed outside the
  building two storeys up, and enclosed in a perforated iron case no that it
  could not possibly be tampered with.</p>

  <p>The policeman blew his whistle, and almost immediately the window on the
  second floor was thrown open and the figure of a frightened girl
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong?" shouted the policeman, and in hysterical tones
  she told her story.</p>

  <p>She was Mr. Baumstein's secretary. He had gone home a quarter of an hour
  before, when she was putting on her hat in the retiring room, and he had
  locked the door, under the impression that she had already left.</p>

  <p>By this time other policemen bad arrived, including the divisional
  inspector. A big crowd had gathered. not unamused by the girl's predicament.
  The police, realising that what had happened was one of those minor tragedies
  of office life, contented themselves with dispersing the crowd, whilst one of
  their number went to the nearest telephone to call up Mr. Baumstein, who was
  not at home. It was suggested that the fire brigade should be called and that
  the girl should he brought down, but to this she would not agree, pretending
  she was too frightened. For an hour and ten minutes she stood at the window,
  talking. to the police officer below. In the meantime Scotland Yard had been
  communicated with, and, knowing his passion for cards. Peter gave a list of
  clubs at which the diamond merchant might be found, and in one of these he
  was discovered and told what had happened. "Secretary?" he said, astonished,
  'My secretary's a man, and he left an hour before I did. I have two typists,
  but they went out with my secretary to the post office. As a matter of fact,
  they asked to be allowed to go early; they were going to a theatre."</p>

  <p>Peter jumped into a cab and came flying hack to Hatton Garden. Long before
  he reached there, the girl had left the window. The alarm bell still
  continued its infernal tintinnabulation; it could not be stilled until
  Baumstein arrived with the secret pass key which turned off the current.</p>

  <p>He opened the door for the waiting officers, who had heard by telephone
  the result of his communication, and they followed him upstairs. The front
  room was littered with housebreaking tools: the door of the big safe hung
  open, a big hole burnt in its face, There was neither girl nor burglars to be
  found. A packet of sixty-three large diamonds, valued at £84,000, and two
  other packets of less value had vanished.</p>

  <p>Peter was at Scotland Yard when the news came through. It was a City job,
  and. though reported to police headquarters, no help was asked..</p>

  <p>"The cleverest job within my recollection," said the chief admiringly.
  "The girl of course appeared in the window to explain why the alarm bell was
  ringing, and just as soon as she appeared the breakers got to work and were
  working all the time she was talking to that butt-headed copper on the
  street. They cleared out the way they came. They had forced the back window
  at exactly the moment she forced the front window&mdash;the bell didn't tell
  you what particular part of the house was being interfered with, and
  naturally nobody took the trouble to inspect the back of the premises when it
  was discovered that a poor little office girl had been accidentally locked
  in."</p>

  <p>Peter could afford to be amused as he read the account while going down to
  Dover. He explained to the vivacious Mrs. Clarke the particulars of the case;
  she was at first shocked, then as lost in admiration as the most impartial
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>Just before the train reached Dover she collected her belongings, and they
  were many: small parcels and big parcels, handbags, rugs, jewel case, and
  three books, tied together with string, to read on the train, and a packet of
  chocolates from a leading London confectioner's, which, with her rug, she
  handed to Peter, towards whom she had assumed the air and manner of a
  proprietor.</p>

  <p>At Dover a shock awaited them; a cordon of police barred all egress; every
  passenger for the Continent was informed that the French Government had
  demanded a careful search of all baggage for contraband. Peter knew that the
  French Government had asked nothing of the sort, and just what the contraband
  was for which they were searching.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Clarke was indignant, but submitted at Peter's suggestion. He stood
  watching whilst packet after packet was opened and examined. It was rather a
  perfunctory search, for Peter had explained to the inspector in charge that
  he was accompanying this pretty lady on duty.</p>

  <p>He saw her through the Customs, and they entered a Carriage which had been
  reserved for them. It seemed to him all the time that Mrs. Clarke did not
  stop talking about the Baumstein robbery, which had evidently caught hold of
  her imagination.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it was a woman's idea. But then, you don't think a great deal of
  women, do you? Perhaps you'll be wiser one of these days."</p>

  <p>Just that and no more. Peter sat for a long time, listening intently. And
  then, suddenly:</p>

  <p>"You must give me my chocolates. Harry loves the English make."</p>

  <p>She leaned over and playfully tugged at the packet. which closely filled
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You must let me take care of them: you'll probably lose them, Mrs.
  Clarke," he said.</p>

  <p>To him the matter was plain sailing, but he was taking no chances, and,
  making an excuse, he went forward to the refreshment car. There were not many
  people on the train, and most of these were just awaking from their sleep,
  for they had been warned that Paris was within fifteen minutes. As he came to
  the door of his compartment, which he had left open he found it closed, and
  the blinds had been drawn down over the windows and over the glass top of the
  door. It was empty. As he stood looking, he received a violent punch between
  the shoulders and staggered forward.</p>

  <p>His first impression was that it was the act of a clumsy passenger, but as
  he turned, the door closed with a crash, and the two men who had followed him
  into the compartment were standing with their backs to the door, and in the
  hand of one was a very business like looking automatic.</p>

  <p>Peter could not see their faces. Dusk had fallen: the only light was the
  overhead lamp, and about each man's chin and nose a silk handkerchief had
  been tied.</p>

  <p>"I'll take that box of chocolates if you don't mind. mister: and in ease
  you think we're rehearsing a crook play, I'm telling you that I'll plug you
  if you give me any trouble&mdash;I owe you one for Leary. Stick 'em up."</p>

  <p>Peter obeyed. One of the men stepped forward and jerked the packet from
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Sit down&mdash;and all I've said before goes." said the first
  speaker.</p>

  <p>To offer resistance was to invite sudden death. Peter had an instinct for
  real danger, and knew exactly what would happen if he dropped his hand to the
  gun in his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>In three minutes he was tied, wrists and ankles; a big woollen scarf was
  wrapped round his mouth and he was rolled on to the floor and under the seat.
  He heard the door open: two slim ankles came into view, and presently he saw
  the mocking smile of Mrs. Clarke.</p>

  <p>"I want you to be very nice to women in the future, Sergeant Dunn," she
  said. "I suppose you guessed what was in the chocolate box&mdash;the
  Baumstein diamonds&mdash;and I suppose you will also guess I was the typist
  who was locked in the office."</p>

  <p>She was down on her knees now for greater comfort, one slim, ringed hand
  resting on the carpet. It was an hour of triumph which she could not
  resist.</p>

  <p>"I was making sure of getting the stuff <a href="http://away.so/">away,
  so</a> I thought I'd bring a police officer along with me to carry it! Was it
  clever?"</p>

  <p>Peter could not speak, but nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's charming of you." Her laugh was long and silvery. He felt that in
  that moment she almost forgave him his indiscretion.</p>

  <p>A little later the train came to a standstill; hoarse cries of "facteurs"
  came to his ears, and, rolling out with some difficulty, he kicked at the
  door. It took him a quarter of an hour to get to the office of the station
  police, for he had some business to do in the dining-car. and he was not
  concerned at the moment about Alin Kelski,</p>

  <p>Thai night he interviewed the chief of the police, who was not very
  sanguine.</p>

  <p>"You might find her in Paris. but it is extremely unlikely." he said. "I
  have just had a telephone message from Le Bourget that several private
  aeroplanes left immediately after the train arrived. Until we cheek their
  destinations we can do nothing. More likely they have gone by car."</p>

  <p>One of the chief's guesses was right. Ann Kelski and her two companions
  had been picked up by a fast car and driven back on their tracks towards the
  Belgian frontier. At Lille an aeroplane carried them to Cologne, where Ann
  Kelski had a flat.</p>

  <p>It was a tired but triumphant woman who closed the door upon her two
  companions.</p>

  <p>"I'd give a lot of money to see that poor bull's face," she said, "and a
  lot more to hear just what Scotland Yard will have to say to him."</p>

  <p>She took from her bag the flat package, cut the string and removed the
  brown wrapping. And then she stared: she had packed the diamonds in a red
  box, and this one was white.</p>

  <p>With trembling hands she pulled open the lid&mdash;under a cover of paper
  shavings were chocolates. Just chocolates and nothing more, and on the top a
  little note scrawled in pencil.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I have an idea you might get the diamonds away from me
  before I can put you in the hands of the police. In case you do, I have made
  certain changes. With the compliments of Sergeant Sir Peter Dunn,
  C.I.D."</p><br>

  <p>"I never even guessed I was carrying the diamonds for the lady until she
  gave me a hint that I was not as clever as I thought I was," said Peter to
  the chief. "I examined the box in the refreshment car, found, as I suspected,
  that it contained the diamonds, and substituted a box of chocolates. The chef
  de service was very obliging: he got me one the exact size. I left the
  diamonds in his safe. I expected that all her boy friends would be waiting
  for her at the Gare du Nord, and I took no chances. Naturally, I should have
  pinched her as soon as we reached Paris if I could have found a French police
  officer. I didn't think that her gang would he travelling on the train."</p>

  <p>"That's the one thing you should have expected," said Superintendent Leigh
  severely.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is a regular and a steady flow of foreign dossiers
  into Scotland Yard. They are written in a variety of languages and deal with
  ladies and gentlemen who have done things which they should not have done.
  Peter Dunn made a practice of studying those documents which came from the
  United States, for he was compiling for headquarters a general review of the
  <i>modus operandi</i> followed by criminals operating outside of the British
  Isles.</p>

  <p>In due course he came upon a short and unflattering biography of Lew
  Stillman, written by an unimaginative officer of Police Headquarters, New
  York City, who, if he lacked literary style. had a passion for facts. Peter
  studied the photograph which accompanied the document, and memorised the
  face. He duly noted that Lew was a British citizen. which made him a little
  more difficult to trace than if he had been of alien origin and was compelled
  to record his presence and movements at the nearest police station.</p>

  <p>There was no need to trace him, for Lew was not "Wanted" by the police.
  His dossier was forwarded as a precautionary measure, because the New York
  police rather imagined that some day or other his life story would be
  interesting to their comrades who lived on the Thames.</p>

  <p>To Lew's documents they attached others which dealt as frankly with the
  past misdoings of Al Stephini. and Hoofer Genelli, and 'Tag' Murphy and
  several other low-down men who lived dangerously but well on the proceeds of
  their illicit professions.</p>

  <p>By a curious coincidence Peter met one of these gentlemen mentioned so
  unfavourably the very week he made the acquaintance of the Garden City of
  Collingwood. In real life things happen that way.</p>

  <p>Peter had left Scotland Yard about four o'clock in the afternoon and was
  walking along Piccadilly to his house in Berkeley Square. That a detective
  sergeant should live in Berkeley Square was of itself a fantastic
  improbability; that he should be a baronet of the United Kingdom was too
  absurd to think about. But if grandfathers leave titles and fortunes, and
  grandsons desire to remain detective sergeants, such anomalies must
  exist.</p>

  <p>He had reached the corner of Berkeley Street when he saw a man standing on
  the edge of the sidewalk, waiting for the traffic to pass. He was a tall,
  olive-faced man. with a large Roman nose and a prominent chin. There was a
  large and glittering diamond on his little finger&mdash;Peter saw this as he
  lit a cigar.</p>

  <p>" 'Lo, Hoofer. Staying long?"</p>

  <p>Hoofer Genelli looked round slowly and surveyed the detective lazily.</p>

  <p>"You have the advantage of me." he said.</p>

  <p>"You bet I have," said Peter. "I'm Detective Sergeant Dunn, C.I.D."</p>

  <p>"Is that so'?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Genelli was not apparently perturbed; he had spent the greater part of
  his life appearing unperturbed in embarrassing moments,</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Dunn. Yes, my name's Genelli&mdash;just
  arrived from America.... stopped off on my way to Paris. Don't remember
  meeting you anywheres, Mr. Dunn?"</p>

  <p>Peter did not attempt to explain that his recognition had anything to do
  with a very detailed description which included:</p>

  <p>"Big nose and chin; scar left cheek; wears diamonds."</p>

  <p>"Take a little walk with me," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Genelli hesitated and fell in by his side. At the nearest police
  station Peter discovered that Hoofer's papers were quite in order, and they
  had a little heart-to-heart talk.</p>

  <p>"You'll be leaving for Paris very soon. I expect. Mr. Genelli? London is
  very quiet&mdash;you'll find Paris a much brighter city."</p>

  <p>"Who told you I was here anyway?" demanded Hoofer. (He had once been a
  professional dancer, hence his sobriquet.)</p>

  <p>Peter ignored the question. If gentlemen of Hoofer's antecedents did not
  know that there was an interchange of confidences between the London and New
  York police departments, they were singularly unimaginative.</p>

  <p>It was on the Saturday of that week that Peter struck Collingwood and its
  amenities.</p>

  <p>Collingwood was not a garden city by predestined plan. It was officially a
  suburb of London, and had begun as a sprawling village of picturesque, if
  insanitary, cottages, which clustered about a church and the Bunch of Grapes
  inn. It developed in the late 'eighties by the creation of a number of
  interesting little estates varying between eight and three acres, and in the
  odd corners of these holdings grew a few avenues of artificially designed
  homes.</p>

  <p>There was nothing vulgar about Collingwood; it had neither slum nor
  problem. Its sidewalks were broad and cemented, its lime avenues were chaste
  and pretty. Most of its shops and stores were in Old Collingwood, through
  which the North Road runs. Collingwood proper, the aristocratic Collingwood,
  lying at the end of a long avenue, remote from the noise and the petrol fumes
  and fatalities of that great highway.</p>

  <p>Peter became acquainted with Collingwood through one of those little
  accidents which throw people literally and figuratively together. He was
  coming back from York, driving a very high-powered, supercharged German car,
  and it naturally irritated him to be held up in one of those narrow stretches
  on the North Road&mdash;which was afterwards widened&mdash;by a car of
  microscopic dimensions which maintained itself, despite his honking and the
  harsh, imperative summons of his horn, on the crown of the road and would
  budge neither left nor night. Then, at last, he detected a movement to the
  side, which he took to be an invitation, and shot his car through the gap;
  the driver of the small car, at the same moment, decided to return to the
  crown of the road. There was a terrifying crash, the splintering of glass,
  and the small vehicle was lifted bodily, and deposited on a grassy bank.</p>

  <p>Peter put all his brakes on and, stopping with a hideous jar, jumped from
  the car and ran backward to give first aid. The little road bug was beyond
  that. It lay over drunkenly. minus one wheel and its off side running board,
  But the occupant was unhurt, save for a scratched face, which bled
  alarmingly.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, thin, not especially pleasant young man. Obviously he had
  had the benefit of a university education and the breeding of a gentleman,
  for all his offensive comments were uttered in cold blood with a certain
  pedantry which was very annoying.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," said Peter testily, "if you hadn't pulled out its I was
  passing...."</p>

  <p>The young man would have cheerfully bled to death rather than forgo the
  opportunity of explaining the strength of his legal position, but Peter cut
  him short. He introduced himself as a police officer, gave first aid, which
  was reluctantly accepted, and, having secured the assistance of a passing
  scout to take the remnants of the car to the nearest garage, he forcibly
  pushed his victim into his own machine, bullied his address from him and came
  to a neat little house in Collingwood.</p>

  <p>It stood in a quarter of an acre of ground. There was a small square of
  tidy lawn in front, and outwardly at any rate, it was one of those prosperous
  little homes that are to be found by the hundreds of thousands throughout the
  length and breadth of England.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and almost immediately the door was opened by a girl who
  wore a large blue wrapper. She was by far the loveliest young woman Peter had
  seen for many a day, even in that unbecoming. costume.</p>

  <p>She stared from the bandaged man to Peter and her face went pale.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing serious, said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious!" The icy venom in the young man's voice was almost
  startling. 'You'll learn whether this is serious or not. I've never seen a
  more brutal disregard of the rights of the road&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She took his arm and led him into the house. Peter was following, but the
  man turned.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you in here&mdash;you keep out. Take his name and address,
  Lydia: I'm too ill to bother with it."</p>

  <p>He jerked his arm impatiently from the woman, and Peter heard his feet
  sound hollowly on uncarpeted stairs as he made his way to the back of the
  house.</p>

  <p>She stood in the half-opened doorway, a picture of discomfort.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry. Is my husband's car very badly smashed?"</p>

  <p>She did not ask him whose fault it was that the accident had occurred and
  in some way Peter divined that she knew who was in the wrong. It struck him
  as remarkable at that moment that she did not ask him into the house. She had
  something to hide: she stood on the doorstep, the door so closed that he
  could not see inside the passage.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is badly damaged, but you are covered by insurance?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My husband never insures. He&mdash;he is rather peculiar about things
  like that. Will you give me your name and address, please?"</p>

  <p>He took out a notebook. wrote it down and tore out the leaf. He was
  handing it to her when a querulous voice came from the house.</p>

  <p>"What's the delay? Are you adding another trophy to your collection? You
  don't imagine I'm going to wait here all the afternoon? I want some tea."</p>

  <p>She almost snatched the page from his hand, and before he knew what had
  happened the door was closed upon him.</p>

  <p>He walked back to his car, interested but not greatly puzzled. His
  experience as a police officer had taught him that it was impossible to take
  the lid off any house without discovering ugly little elements of
  discord.</p>

  <p>As he got into the driver's scat he was aware that there was an audience
  to the scene. A man was standing by an oaken gate on the other side of the
  road. As he turned the car and came opposite, the man signalled him and he
  came across to the sidewalk. He was a short, florid man with a wisp of yellow
  moustache.</p>

  <p>"Has that bird been smashed up?" he asked. "That was always coming to
  him!"</p>

  <p>Peter stared at his interrogator and brought the machine to a standstill:
  but apparently the man did not observe his surprise.</p>

  <p>"Too proud at thirty&mdash;that's what's the matter with him. They had the
  sheriff in their house last week&mdash;took every stick of furniture. They
  couldn't take the car because it doesn't belong to him. That girl's worth
  forty thousand of Mr. Walter L. Glynne. All that he does is run around with a
  necktie showing he went to a swell school. He's the biggest sucker I've met
  in years&mdash;falls for anybody who can tell him a tale. Say, if that guy
  was rich you wouldn't be able to get into this street for con men. Is he
  hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Not badly." said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry." said the little man. He looked towards the house that hid his
  unpopular neighbour and smacked his thick lips. "She's a peach, eh? One nice
  little girl."</p>

  <p>"Met a friend of yours recently," said Peter, interrupting the rhapsody.
  "Hoofer Genelli."</p>

  <p>The man stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" he said slowly. "Is old Hoofer in town?" And then,
  quickly: "Hoofer who? I don't know any Hoofers, mister."</p>

  <p>"I'm merely telling you that I met him in town," said Peter. "How long
  have you been living here. Stillman?" The man was looking at him through
  narrowed lids. "Nearly a year, I guess," <i>he</i> drawled. "So you're at
  detective, eh? You've got nothing on me. I'm a British citizen, born in
  Toronto."</p>

  <p>Peter changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"What does Glynne do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the other, obviously relieved that the conversation was
  switched to a more pleasant topic. "He just goes around in a mechanical
  push-cart; borrowed it from a friend who didn't know any better."</p>

  <p>He thought a moment. Then:</p>

  <p>"Come inside, mister?"</p>

  <p>Peter got down and went into the house with him. It was small but
  comfortably furnished.</p>

  <p>"Will you have a drink?.... Tea, then?" He rang the bell. "It's a wonder
  you fellows have got any nerves left, I'm getting the habit myself."</p>

  <p>A neat maid in black brought in a tea tray.</p>

  <p>"Ever seen work like that?" Stillman handled the delicate lace tea-cloth.
  "I'll bet you haven't! Hand-worked. I've got three of them. And
  mats....!"</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn was not to be led completely off the subject by Mr. Stillman's
  enthusiasm for fine needlework, and for ten minutes he questioned, admonished
  and advised.</p>

  <p>"Say, don't you worry about me." Lew's smile was bland and confident.</p>

  <p>"I'm not worrying so much that it will keep me awake at night," said
  Peter.</p>

  <p>Before he left they got back to the subject of Mr. Walter Glynne, and
  Peter had one piece of information which explained the cryptic remark which
  had been barked at the girl from the head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Jealous? I should say he was! I wouldn't have that man's disposition for
  a million dollars. She never goes out of the house except when he's with her.
  He thinks she's running after every man she meets. That's the kind of boy he
  is. If he only knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and chuckled, and then. seeing Peter's cold eye upon him,
  hastily disclaimed all that was sinister in his innuendo.</p>

  <p>"That's no light baby, don't worry! Straight as a line. But what I say is,
  Mr. Dunn, what's the use of sticking close to a grouch like that, when you
  could have all the money in the world you want, eh? Do you know how they
  live? They've got two little beds they bought from a junk dealer, a couple of
  chairs and a table! She washes the curtains herself&mdash;sits up all night
  from sheer pride so that none of the neighbours see the curtains are down.
  The house is hers; he'd have sold that, only the trustees wouldn't allow
  it."</p>

  <p>Peter carried away from Collingwood an unhappy memory of the poor little
  girl in the blue wrapper. He had a vague idea of sending her money
  anonymously, but realised. if all Lew Stillman had said was true, that it
  would bring her little benefit.</p>

  <p>He made a few inquiries and learned that Stillman had not exaggerated when
  he had described the husband as a wastrel. He did not drink, had no apparent
  vices, except a colossal vanity which was expressed in a profound contempt
  for the commercial classes. He had written poetry. and had sought a short way
  to wealth, having as his guide an outside broker, who had stripped him of his
  own meagre fortune and as much of his wife's property as was realisable.</p>

  <p>It was surprising how many people knew of Walter Lister Glynne, though it
  did not amaze Peter, who had discovered before that most people's lives are
  an open book for those who trouble to turn the pages.</p>

  <p>There came to him a letter from Mr. Glynne's solicitors and the threat of
  an action at law&mdash;this was one of the young man's most expensive
  hobbies&mdash;and he had turned the matter over to his lawyer when
  Collingwood again obtruded into his daily life.</p>

  <p>There were three little communities, of which Collingwood was the centre:
  Helstone was one, Digbury Park was another and Cornford Heights was the
  third: Cornford village, being situate at least fifty feet higher than any of
  its neighbours, was entitled to the "Heights". Digbury Park and Collingwood
  lay just inside the Metropolitan Police area, and as such came within
  Scotland Yard's sphere of influence. The superintendent sent for Peter one
  month.,</p>

  <p>"Do you know Collingwood?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Do I know it!" said Peter scornfully. "There's a lawyer there who writes
  me twice a week. and I think I mentioned that our friend Lew Stillman is in
  residence in that area."</p>

  <p>"You know his record&mdash;is he a burglar?" asked the superintendent.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he's everything but," he said.</p>

  <p>The superintendent took up a little pad of papers and handed them to his
  subordinate.</p>

  <p>"You might go down and make a few inquiries," he said. "In the past six
  months there has been a series of peculiar burglaries committed in this
  neighbourhood, and the Hertfordshire police have asked us to investigate.
  It's evident that the same gentleman is operating in every case." Peter
  turned over the sheets.</p>

  <p>"What have they taken?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the unexpected reply. "That's the odd thing. In every case
  they have left silver and valuables which they couldn't very well have
  missed, and in every case the writing desk was broken open and papers
  searched. Usually the fellow who's been doing the job has waited until the
  householder has been away, and the suggestion is that he knows their habits
  and is more or less acquainted with their plans, In no case has money been
  stolen&mdash;that I want to impress upon you."</p>

  <p>Peter took the documents to his office and read very carefully the police
  reports. In every affair entrance had been made through a side door and only
  two rooms in the house had been searched&mdash;the study and the bedroom.
  Once a pocket-book had been taken, but no other property.</p>

  <p>He began his investigations that afternoon, called at a house in Digbury
  Park and interviewed the occupant, a well-to-do bachelor stockbroker who
  lived with his sister. He was evidently a man of comfortable means. The house
  was large and the grounds fairly extensive. He could give no information that
  threw any light, on the mysterious visitor.</p>

  <p>"My sister was away at the seaside when it happened. and I was staying in
  town at my club. The house was empty&mdash;my sister had the maid with her,
  and the cook was on her holiday. The queer thing is that they didn't steal a
  very valuable silver statuette which stands on my writing table; and, what is
  stranger still, they left the money which they found in one of the drawers
  they forced."</p>

  <p>The burglary had happened three months before, and the broker was rather
  surprised that the police were resuming their investigations, and should
  consider the case important enough to send a man from the Yard.</p>

  <p>Peter looked over the house. He saw nothing till he came to the
  dining-room.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to an oblong strip of lace that lay on the polished surface of
  the table. For a second the stockbroker looked a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"That? Well, that's just a sort of.... I don't know what you call them,"
  he said awkwardly.</p>

  <p>Peter picked up the edge of the flimsy thing and saw here a beautifully
  worked coat of arms. He had seen the same design on the tea cloth in Lew
  Stillman's parlour. His next call was on a middle-aged widower who had a tiny
  house on the edge of Collingwood. and here again no explanation was
  forthcoming for the burglary, which had almost been forgotten by the
  owner.</p>

  <p>"No, nothing, was taken&mdash;except my bank pass-book. The poor devil
  must have thought he'd got hold of a prize. As a matter of fact, the
  pass-book was returned to my hank three or four days later. As you know, when
  the bank sends out a book it usually encloses a printed envelope for its
  return; this was used and posted in London."</p>

  <p>Again Peter made an inspection of the house, and again made an interesting
  discovery.</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock that night when he came back to Collingwood and
  knocked at the door of "Gleneagles," by which magnificent name Mr. Lew
  Stillman's modest villa had been christened by its builder. He knocked and
  rang, but no answer came. A servant of the next house, who was gossiping in
  the dusk with a young man, volunteered a few facts.</p>

  <p>"We don't often sec him. He usually comes in by the back way. There's a
  little lane at the back of the house," she said.</p>

  <p>"Are his servants out'?"</p>

  <p>Here she was a mine of information. They did not sleep in the house, Mr.
  Stillman preferring complete privacy between sunset and dawn.</p>

  <p>Peter went back to the house and rang again; there was no answer. He went
  round to the back of the house and found the back gate locked.</p>

  <p>It was grossly improper of him, since his affairs were in the hands of
  lawyers, to call upon one with whom he was engaged in litigation.
  Nevertheless, he crossed to the pathetic little house which held the mean
  secrets of the Glynnes.</p>

  <p>He pressed the bell, but apparently it was out of order, and the sound of
  his knock echoed hollowly. He heard the movement of light footsteps in the
  hall and the door was opened a few inches.</p>

  <p>The house was in darkness, though from somewhere above came a tiny glimmer
  of light.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>It was Lydia Glynne's voice. Then apparently she recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Is it Mr. Dunn&mdash;my husband is not in. Please don't stay!"</p>

  <p>There was a note of agitation in her voice.</p>

  <p>"When will he be back?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. You won't think I am very rude if I turn you away. will
  you?.... Only my husband doesn't like me to receive visitors."</p>

  <p>She was on the point of closing the door when he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble, Mrs. Glynne? Perhaps I can help you."</p>

  <p>He heard a quick sigh.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm afraid you can't&mdash;I'd rather you didn't wait."</p>

  <p>She was almost incoherent in her anxiety for his departure, and he could
  do no more than bid her a goodnight which was cut in half by the closing of
  the door.</p>

  <p>He intended seeing Glynne that night, whatever happened, but it was vital
  that he should see him in the presence of his wife.</p>

  <p>Rain was falling when he turned into the narrow lane that ran along the
  back of the houses. As he did so he thought he saw a figure disappearing into
  the darkness ahead of him, It might have been an occupant of one of the other
  houses: apparently the back lane was frequently used</p>

  <p>He walked along to the end and found himself on the main road of
  Collingwood. There were a few cars in sight: the red tail light of one was
  disappearing in the direction of London as he looked.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour he waited, but there was no sign of Glynne, and
  turning, he walked back along the dark lane. He was twenty yards from the
  entrance of Stillman's house when he heard the scrambling of feet against
  wood: a dark figure appeared over the top of the fence, dropped into the lane
  and ran. He came from Stillman's house, and Peter sprinted in pursuit. The
  man ran fast and he could not gain on him. Darting up a very narrow passage
  between the two houses, he flew across the road and for a second was lost in
  the darkness. The door of Mr. Glynne's house slammed as he reached the outer
  gate. He knocked, but no answer came. He knocked again more loudly.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" It was the girl's voice, husky with fear, "Open the door,
  Mrs. Glynne. It is Sergeant Dunn." There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"I can't open the door: I am going to bed."</p>

  <p>"Open the door. I know your husband come in and I want him."</p>

  <p>The conversation could be carried on in a low voice, for the door was
  glass-panelled. He heard the key snap, and, pushing past her, closed the door
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"Have you a light?" he asked the shadowy figure. "No." Her voice was
  quivering. "The electric light is cut off&mdash;my husband isn't well. I'm
  afraid he's fainted...."</p>

  <p>And then Peter heard her sob.</p>

  <p>"Oh.... I'm glad you've come.... that somebody's come!"</p>

  <p>He took an electric torch from his pocket and flashed it along the bare
  boards of the passage.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>She led the way, pushed open a door that led to the back room and he went
  in.</p>

  <p>Walter Lister Glynne lay, an inert heap, on the ground. Stooping, Peter
  turned him over and gasped. There was blood on the man's hands and on his
  face where the hands had touched. The sleeves of his coat were redly wet. He
  heard a scream behind him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God! What has he done?"</p>

  <p>"Bring a lamp&mdash;you've got one upstairs. Or wait here&mdash;I'll get
  it."</p>

  <p>He ran upstairs and brought down a small paraffin lamp and put it on the
  table of the unfurnished dining-room. Glynne had recovered; be was sitting,
  his face buried in his hands, shivering and whimpering. Peter shook him by
  the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Who was it&mdash;Stillman?"</p>

  <p>"Dead," shivered Glynne hysterically. "Terrible....! He was sitting at his
  desk. I touched him, and when I put the light on it was horrible!.... I
  didn't do it.... I swear I didn't do it! I went to find the letters she's
  been writing to these men. I know she's been writing. to them and visiting
  them. You&mdash;you!" he screamed, pointing to the white-faced girl. "I've
  been looking for them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We know all about what you've been looking for," snarled Peter. "You've
  been looking for the love letters that your wife never wrote, you poor
  worm!"</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Wash him&mdash;he wants it," he said, and flew out of the house.</p>

  <p>He found a policeman, and together they went to the back of the house and
  mounted the fence. When he switched on the light in Lew Stillman's
  dining-room he saw something which was not nice to look upon. Stillman had
  been shot through the head at close quarters. His hand was still gripping the
  gun he had drawn but had no time to use.</p>

  <p>They arrested Hoofer at Waterloo Station that night. when he was on the
  point of catching the boat train for Southampton. and he accepted his fate
  philosophically. "Lew got his." he said. "He sent three of our gang to the
  chair when he turned State's evidence. the rat! Then he bolted for England.
  We've been waiting for him&mdash;my brother was one who went to the death
  house. If I hadn't caught him in London one of our boys would have picked him
  up in Paris."</p>

  <p>A day or to later Peter had an interview with his chief. "The curious
  thing was, I was expecting Glynne, to burgle Stillman's house that night. The
  man was insanely jealous, knew that his wife was writing to various friends
  of hers, and was calling on them after dark. Why? She was keeping him in food
  by her lace work&mdash;sold d'oyleys and tray cloths and made her friends who
  bought them swear they wouldn't tell. Walter Lister Glynne would have died of
  shame if he had known Naturally, all this selling entailed a lot of
  correspondence and canvassing. and this poor simpleton, being jealous as
  blazes, thought that scattered round the country were a whole lot of
  compromising letters. He burgled one house after another, trying to find
  evidence of her flightiness&mdash;why, the Lord knows! Anyway, she's left him
  and she is starting a little business of her own in the West End. Some mug is
  lending her five hundred pounds for stock."</p>

  <p>The superintendent thought he knew who that mug was.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">ANY country is a pretty small place for a man who wishes to
  avoid recognition. There were once two young men who worked together as
  student- apprentices in a large drug store in the Midlands. In those days
  they were called "chemist shops", and the proprietor usually lived upstairs
  and kept his own books.</p>

  <p>The two young men might have served as models for story book characters of
  a more modern kind, for one was idle and honest, and the other was
  industrious and enterprising. The idle and honest apprentice married the
  daughter of his bankrupt master (she subsequently ran away from him) and
  eventually he became an habitual drunkard; the industrious apprentice was
  discharged at a minute's notice and left, taking with him a considerable sum
  of money and an odd assortment of pharmaceutic knowledge.</p>

  <p>One day the drunkard, who had migrated to London, saw a man step from a
  handsome limousine, and accosted him by his name.</p>

  <p>"Go to the devil!" said his wealthy fellow apprentice. Enraged by this
  reception the down-and-out struck at his old friend; a policeman intervened,
  and a vulgar brawl might have ended in a police court conviction, but for the
  fact that the prosecutor did not arrive to charge his assailant. The man was
  released; a mysterious somebody sent him an envelope containing fifty pounds
  in notes, and there would have been the end of the matter, but for the
  aggrieved prisoner, under the influence of further libations, attending at
  Scotland Yard and demanding that the name and address of his enemy should be
  given to him. Nor would he leave until he had made a most libellous statement
  concerning his former companion, and this statement he insisted upon reducing
  to writing.</p>

  <p>Such things happen at Scotland Yard. Horrific tales arrive daily, are
  probed with infinite pains and patience and usually dispersed. The scope for
  inquiry here was small; the document was filed away in the "crazy drawer",
  and was forgotten. It concerned one Paul Sibbett who had a weakness for
  experiment.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn, hunting for a similar document one day, came upon it and
  wondered what was Amotoxylene (he gathered from the ill-written paper that
  this was the word), but he made no steps to discover its properties. As for
  the story of the wanton experiments on dogs, that was possible, but not worth
  further inquiry.</p>

  <p>Old Superintendent Brissen used to say that all events were triplets: that
  if a red-haired man was arrested for burgling a fish shop, two other
  red-haired men would also be arrested for burgling fish shops.</p>

  <p>He was mainly right, though Peter Dunn had never met coincidence eye to
  eye until he undertook the Bletsall inquiry.</p>

  <p>First of all was the strange affair of the drunken man. It was odd in
  itself that this should have happened within twenty-four hours of his
  becoming acquainted with the story of the two apprentices.</p>

  <p>Going back to his house that night, he found a man hanging on to the
  railings. He was in evening dress, apparently a gentleman, so far as a man
  can be a gentleman who permits himself the weakness of inebriation. Peter
  would have passed him by, not because he was pharisaical, but because drunken
  people bored him but the helpless young man spoke:</p>

  <p>"I say.... take my hands away, will you?"</p>

  <p>His voice was thick and tremulous.</p>

  <p>Peter halted.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with your hands?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Can't let go."</p>

  <p>The detective stepped to his side and tried to loosen the hands: they were
  gripped convulsively; it took all his strength to release them.</p>

  <p>But for his arm, the victim would have fallen. It was as he supported the
  limp figure that he realised that certain symptoms of drunkenness were
  entirely absent. His house was near and he half dragged and half carried the
  man into his study and dropped him on to a settee. It was half an hour before
  the wilted figure got up of his own volition. He was deadly pale, sweat beads
  stood on his forehead and cheeks, and his eyes were strangely dilated until
  they were all pupils.</p>

  <p>"Terribly sorry&mdash;I don't know what happened. Can't remember a darned
  thing!"</p>

  <p>Peter had given him brandy, straight, and the spirit had been
  efficacious.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not tight.... awfully good of you to do this for me. I've not
  been very well all day&mdash;headache, took an aspirin...."</p>

  <p>His name was Martin. Peter gathered that he had been in the army. He
  declined the invitation to be seen home and was well enough to walk to the
  cab which Peter called.</p>

  <p>The second leg of the coincidence appeared a week later.</p>

  <p>The life of a detective would be one grand, sweet song if mysterious bank
  robberies and picturesque murders made up the round of his daily life. In
  reality his work is dull and wearisome. He spends his days and nights asking
  Bill Jones what has happened to his friend Harry Smith, and listening
  incredulously whilst Bill explains that the last time he saw Harry was two
  years ago come Easter.</p>

  <p>Or else he is plodding on the clue of a laundry mark discovered on the
  shirt of a drowned man, or he is investigating the circumstances under which
  a ton of old lead piping disappears from a lock-up store under a railway arch
  and miraculously reappears in the back yard of a marine store dealer.</p>

  <p>Sometimes. when work was very heavy and the leave season was in full
  swing, Peter Dunn took on odd little jobs. He was a bachelor, had few
  interests outside his career, and was considerably disturbed when the death
  of his grandfather brought, him the baronetcy, the house in Berkeley Square
  and the wherewithal for its upkeep. He never despised odd jobs: they
  sometimes had curious and fascinating ramifications.</p>

  <p>He reported for duty&mdash;he was relieving two men who were on their
  holidays&mdash;and found three jobs awaiting him. The first was an
  identification, which was soon disposed of, since the prisoner was at Cannon
  Row; the second a matter of a driving licence which had been loaned by its
  confiding owner to a gentleman whose licence had been suspended for a year
  for driving to the common danger, and the third was a petty cash affair in
  the office of Mr. Greeley Bletsall.</p>

  <p>There was a man at Scotland Yard who knew everybody. He was a walking
  reference book, though his information could hardly have been published
  without involving him in innumerable suits for libel.</p>

  <p>"Who is Bletsall? He's supposed to be worth a million, but he's been going
  badly on the Stock Exchange lately&mdash;he's the biggest mug punter the City
  has met for years. Owes money left and right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is he broke?"</p>

  <p>The little inspector who was the source of information shook his untidy
  head. He was one of the dwindling army of snuff-takers, as his soiled tunic
  proved.</p>

  <p>"No: those kind of fellows aren't broke as we understand being
  broke&mdash;they don't have to count up the shillings on Saturdays. He owes a
  hundred thousand here and a hundred thousand there&mdash;that's high finance!
  He's had a lot of trouble in turning aside a couple of petitions."</p>

  <p>Mr. Greeley Bletsall occupied a suite in St. James's Street where he
  directed the affairs of a colonial trading company. The Greeley Trading
  Company was not a familiar name to the average Londoner who passed its office
  daily, but it had a magical sound to millions of uncultured natives who
  exchanged their rubber for Manchester goods and Birmingham brassware.</p>

  <p>There was not a man or woman who lived on the Coast or in the dark
  interior of the Continent, who did not know Greeleys,</p>

  <p>Miss Henrietta Greeley had married Mr. Bletsall, who had been a young
  married clerk in the concern. On the death of his wife, he had married the
  unprepossessing daughter of old Tom Greeley and had changed his name to
  Greeley Bletsall. When his wife had died on a sea voyage, he inherited the
  control of a company which was reputed to have a turnover of considerably
  more than a million and a half a year. He had been in Parliament, was on two
  insurance boards, belonged to certain exclusive clubs, and was famous for his
  large gifts to charitable institutions.</p>

  <p>Charitable as he was, he could not extend his charity to the miscreant who
  had opened his desk drawer and taken therefrom seven one-pound notes.</p>

  <p>"It is not the first time this has happened," he told Peter. "I have
  missed money before. I usually keep a number of notes in this drawer, and I
  invariably keep a check on them by putting in a slip of paper representing
  the amount I take out,"</p>

  <p>It was a large and imposing desk in a large and imposing room, panelled
  with walnut and nobly furnished. Mr. Greeley Bletsall was himself on the
  large side&mdash;a big, sandy-haired man. with a long, narrow face and pale
  blue eyes which at the moment were gleaming wrathfully under the shaggy
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>His polished table was a model of neatness, innocent of litter, and he
  himself was as spotless as his surroundings, There was no speck of cigarette
  ash on his immaculate black coat to testify to his human weakness.</p>

  <p>He sat back in his padded chair, the finger tips of one hand (exquisitely
  manicured, Peter noticed) touching the finger tips of the other. It was a
  prayerful gesture to be found on the tombs of old crusaders, but Mr. Greeley
  Bletsall was not praying.</p>

  <p>''There are three people I suspect. . . the porter,"&mdash;he ticked them
  off daintily&mdash;"the office boy, and the young lady who assists my
  secretary. Just one moment."</p>

  <p>He pressed an ivory bellpush and a girl came in. She was extraordinarily
  pretty, but just a little too pale, Peter thought. She had the cultured voice
  of a lady, but he detected in her some curious, unexpected
  nervousness&mdash;unexpected because he could not imagine that the
  confidential secretary of so important a man could be in the slightest degree
  uncomfortable in the presence of an officer of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lane will tell you all she knows." Mr. Bletsall was impressive and a
  little pompous.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't know very much." She smiled faintly. "I came in
  yesterday morning and found the drawer unlocked. Somebody had used a key to
  open the drawer, but was unable to pull the key out after the drawer was
  open. I didn't miss the money, naturally, because I didn't know how much was
  there."</p>

  <p>"You have the key," said Mr. Bletsall.</p>

  <p>She went out to find it. It had been extracted with great difficulty by a
  locksmith.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have no doubt about Miss Lane?." said Peter.</p>

  <p>It was a very commonplace question, and one he would have made in any
  circumstances, for it was his experience that even quite beautiful young
  ladies can pilfer their employers' desks.</p>

  <p>The effect of this innocent inquiry upon Mr. Bletsall was amazing. His
  sallow face flushed red, he sat bolt upright in his chair and the pale blue-
  eyes blazed wrathfully,</p>

  <p>"How dare you, sir!" His voice trembled. "Accuse my, secretary! It is a
  monstrous suggestion. Miss Lane is incapable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I merely asked." Peter hastened to appease the angry man.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lane is a lady of the highest possible character, though in certain
  respects she may be a little wayward, but that is a privilege of youth."</p>

  <p>At this moment the lady under discussion returned and put a little key on
  the desk. Peter was not really interested: it was a very common experience
  for a desk drawer to be opened by a key which was never intended to open it
  and for that key to ''stick". He picked it up and examined it perfunctorily.
  then put it down again. "You will not be able to trace the thief by that," he
  said. "It is a very ordinary type of key. There must be dozens of them in
  every city office. If you will give me a room I will question the people you
  suspect."</p>

  <p>"Will it be necessary for me to charge them?" asked Mr. Bletsall. "I am a
  very busy man and I have important duties which take up all my time."</p>

  <p>"I haven't found the thief yet, sir." smiled Peter good-humouredly. "If I
  do. you will certainly have to charge him, or you can arrange for your
  secretary to appear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Lane will not appear in any police court!" said Mr. Bletsall loudly.
  I would sooner go myself a hundred times than submit that lady to the
  ignominy of&mdash;er...."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean." said Peter.</p>

  <p>He was secretly amused, and a little puzzled. The colour which came to the
  girl's pale face was certainly not caused by pleasure at this exhibition of
  her employer's solicitude. It spoke of embarrassment, possibly annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I will show you into the waiting room," she said, and turned and walked
  quickly into the outer office.</p>

  <p>Peter followed.</p>

  <p>She opened the door of the waiting room and came in after him, closing the
  door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dunn," she said, a little breathlessly, "I am terribly afraid it
  <i>is</i> the porter. He has a sick wife and he has had a lot of trouble with
  money-lenders. I have not dared tell Mr. Bletsall for fear he would discharge
  him or something worse."</p>

  <p>"Is the man here?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He is away today&mdash;Mr. Bletsall doesn't even know that. I don't think
  you could prove it, I am quite willing to find the money myself to prevent a
  prosecution."</p>

  <p>Peter pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly what I can do in the matter. You'd better fix it
  with Mr. Bletsall. I am sure he would do the reasonable thing if you asked
  him," he said.</p>

  <p>This was no novel situation: it was one with which the police are
  frequently confronted. They are always reluctant to bring a first offender in
  the court. and will even condone petty larceny to avoid the ruin of a man's
  career.</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. with it little catch in her breath.. "I don't want to be
  under any&mdash;I don't wish to ask Mr. Bletsall&mdash; Couldn't you speak
  for him? I'd much rather you did."</p>

  <p>There was no mystery here either. Evidently there were many reasons why
  she did not wish to be under an obligation to her employer&mdash;Peter
  guessed one.</p>&lt;

  <p>"I will see the porter," he said. "if you give me his address. Has he
  confessed to you that he has stolen the money?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"No." she said at last, but he didn't believe her.</p>

  <p>"I've asked somebody to see Jansen this morning," she said. "A friend of
  mine&mdash;which was selfish of me for he has been terribly ill. I'm afraid
  there is little he can do."</p>

  <p>Jansen, the porter, lived in a workman's flat near Notting Hill, a tired,
  middle-aged man, who almost fainted when Peter revealed his identity.</p>

  <p>"Come in, sir." he faltered at last. "Miss Lane's young gentleman is here.
  He came to see if he could fix things up for me. My wife has just been taken
  to hospital. Thank God she doesn't know anything about this business!"</p>

  <p>Here was a pitiful little tragedy the like of which Peter had seen again
  and again: a man with a blameless record who had succumbed to temptation and
  stolen a few pounds. Such as he come in endless procession to the police
  courts of the land, some to pass under probation, some to prison and a
  subsequent criminal career.</p>

  <p>He followed him to the poorly furnished little parlour. The young man. who
  was standing by the window and looking into the street, turned as they came
  in. He was young, rather good-looking, the type which public schools turn out
  by the thousand.</p>

  <p>For a second he did not know the visitor, though he could guess that this
  was Miss Lane's young gentleman. And then, suddenly, he recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Hello! Better?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Martin was momentarily puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! You are the fellow who was so decent to me the other
  night."</p>

  <p>They shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm well enough. though I felt pretty bad for a few days. You've
  come to see Jansen?"</p>

  <p>The detective explained his business in a few words, and the trembling
  porter sank into a chair, incapable of speech. "Yes, I took the money. sir; I
  thought I would be able to put it back. It was not seven pounds&mdash;it was
  three, and the last time it was one. I have been twenty years in the office,
  sir. and I was with old Mr. Greeley when he died. I was the last person to
  see him alive&mdash;took in an aspirin, and I'd hardly got out of the office
  before he was dead. Heart trouble, like his poor daughter suffered from."</p>

  <p>Peter looked at him long and thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh. indeed. Now, tell me about this theft of yours."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bletsall sent you sir? He was Rood to me in those days: he sent me
  abroad to Africa to collect Mr. Greeley's papers when be died and gave me
  fifty pounds. I ought to he ashamed of what I've done...."</p>

  <p>He hid his head in his arms and began to sob.</p>

  <p>"It was not the only thing I took. I might as well make a clean breast of
  it. I was not sure which drawer the money was in, so I opened the bottom one
  first, took out a case and put it in my packet. He sometimes keeps his money
  in the pocket case. I locked the drawer and was going away when I found I had
  made a mistake and tried the second drawer; that's where the key stuck."</p>

  <p>"Where is the pocket ease?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>Without a word the man went out of the room and come back with a flat
  leather case. Peter opened it and examined its contents before he slipped it
  in his pocket. Then Jansen broke down again, and Peter beckoned the young man
  out of the room.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there is not much to be done," he said. "I shall have to take
  a statement from him and Bletsall must prosecute."</p>

  <p>"It's a damnable shame," said the young man, hotly. "Bletsall has
  underpaid him for years."</p>

  <p>"You know Mr. Bletsall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, slightly. I know Miss Lane better."</p>

  <p>"You are her young gentleman, in fact," said Peter with a twinkle in his
  eye.</p>

  <p>The young man smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We are engaged. She asked me to call on this chap this morning and
  see if I could do anything for him. if Bletsall sets his mind on prosecuting,
  he will prosecute. He is a vindictive beast, though, perhaps, I ought not to
  say that; he offered me a very good job to take charge of one of his stations
  in Africa."</p>

  <p>There was something in his voice which made Peter look at him keenly.</p>

  <p>"You have turned it down, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have turned it down?" said the other. He hesitated. "I cannot
  afford to, but.... well, I'd rather be in London for all sorts of
  reasons."</p>

  <p>Peter interviewed the broken man again. Obviously he was incapable of
  making any statement at the moment, and he decided to go back to St. James's
  Street.</p>

  <p>Here he had a surprise: Mr. Bletsall's attitude was entirely changed.</p>

  <p>"Very stupid of me, inspector&mdash;",</p>

  <p>"Sergeant. murmured Peter.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant, is it'? Well, the truth is that I told this man to take any
  money he wanted out of my desk."</p>

  <p>"He's an old servant of the family, isn't he?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"He has been here some years," agreed Mr. Bletsall, in his stateliest
  manner.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"So he said."</p>

  <p>He fastened his notebook and put it into his pocket. "So we shall let the
  matter rest. shall we, Mr. Bletsall?"</p>

  <p>"If you please."</p>

  <p>He put his hand in his pocket rather ostentatiously.</p>

  <p>"If you are going to offer me a reward, I'll save you the trouble," said
  Peter, smiling. "I must report the matter to headquarters, but I don't
  suppose they will take any further action."</p>

  <p>He had noticed, as he came into the office, the little glass box which
  served Miss Lane as an office. He knocked at the door and went in.</p>

  <p>She was sitting at her desk, but she was not working. She turned with a
  look of alarm on her face, which cleared as she saw the visitor.</p>

  <p>"We fixed Jansen," he said. "I thought you would like to know."</p>

  <p>Obviously it was no news to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes I know. Did you meet Mr. Martin?"</p>

  <p>He was still standing at the door and from here he commanded a private
  view of the glass panelled door which led to Bletsall's office. He saw the
  shadow of the man against the glass panel.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Then, lowering his voice: "Do you go out to tea?"</p>

  <p>He was amused at the sudden doubt which came into her eyes, and
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not being gallant," he said, "but I am trying to make a date
  with you. Do you think you could meet me at&mdash;" he named a fashionable
  tea shop near at hand&mdash;"at five o'clock?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, and then he heard Bletsall's voice, addressing him. in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and he came out to meet the big man's suspicious
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would tell Miss Lane that the matter had been settled." he
  said.</p>

  <p>"It was not necessary," snapped Bletsall.</p>

  <p>Once outside the office, Peter hailed a taxi-cab and a few minutes later
  was interviewing his chief at Scotland Yard. It was a long interview because
  the heads of departments were called in, there were visits to the record
  office and a hastily summoned analyst made rapid experiments in his
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>It was a quarter of an hour after the appointed time that she came.
  hurrying, into the vestibule of the tea rooms; she was breathlessly
  apologetic.</p>

  <p>"It was difficult to get away," she said. "but fortunately Mr. Bletsall
  was called to the City."</p>

  <p>He found a quiet corner of the room and ordered tea. "You know I am a
  detective?"</p>

  <p>"I know all about you." In spite of her trouble she could smile. "You are
  Sir Peter Dunn. Mr. Bletsall doesn't know, but I was reading something about
  you in the newspapers and I recognised your photograph"</p>

  <p>"I shall have to raise the salary of my publicity agent."</p>

  <p>Then he went on seriously: "You know I am a detective, and I am going to
  ask you a few questions for my own private information." Then he asked her:
  "Has this man been making love to you?"</p>

  <p>She changed colour and seemed inclined for a moment to resent his blunt
  methods.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Bletsall has asked me to marry him."</p>

  <p>"You are engaged to Martin, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Bletsall has offered him a post at a thousand a year in Africa."</p>

  <p>He saw her lips curl.</p>

  <p>"At Maleti! It is built on a swamp. Four of the agents have died there in
  three years!"</p>

  <p>"When was the offer made?"</p>

  <p>"About a week ago. Mr. Bletsall took Ivor out to dinner and put the offer
  before him. He didn't tell me that he was taking Ivor; it was done very
  secretly. Fortunately I told Ivor about Maleti. It is a horrid position for
  me: he pays me a very big salary. I simply can't afford to leave because my
  young sister is at school&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter was putting sugar into a fresh cup of tea when he saw her look up
  with an expression of alarm. Mr. Bletsall was standing not a few yards away.
  glowering down at them. and he came slowly forward.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were at the office, Miss Lane," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>The girl was obviously terrified of him. She rose without a word of
  apology and slipped past him out of the shop. For a few seconds he stood,
  staring at the detective.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Bletsall."</p>

  <p>To Peter's surprise the big man came slowly to the table, drew up a chair
  and sat down.</p>

  <p>"This is hardly part of your duty, is it? Or is it pleasure'?"</p>

  <p>"Purely pleasure," said Peter. "I was discussing the future of
  Jansen."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to discuss the future of Jansen&mdash;that is assured,"
  said Bletsall.</p>

  <p>Peter looked at him for a second, and then:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you prosecute the fellow who struck you about three months ago
  in Regent Street?"</p>

  <p>The colour went from the man's face, then slowly faded back again.</p>

  <p>"Because I didn't choose." he said.</p>

  <p>His attitude was frankly antagonistic, but he must have had the most
  amazing command over his emotions, for suddenly he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dunn." he said. "you understand that my position is rather a peculiar
  one. Money is very tight in the City. I have been having heavy losses, and I
  could not afford to figure in a vulgar brawl. If it happened today I wouldn't
  mind, because I have made a great deal of money, and I could afford to snap
  my fingers at my enemies." He lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you realise that there is a financial combination in the City
  of London which has been doing its best to ruin me for five years?"</p>

  <p>He was obviously sincere. Rapidly he named the heads of three great
  finance corporations, familiar figures in the City, and men whose integrity
  was a household word. "Don't let's beat about the bush, Mr. Dunn. I know you
  came to inquire into the robbery, but the real reason for your inquiries was
  to discover my financial position." Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Police officers do not&mdash;" he began, but the other interrupted
  him.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect you to admit it," he smiled. "Well, you can tell your
  friends that by Wednesday morning their accounts will be cleared, and I shall
  have a million to my credit at the Bank of England&mdash;that should satisfy
  them. Luck has always been on my side," he went on gaily. "I am an inheritor.
  If my big deal hadn't come off, somebody would have died and left me a
  million."</p>

  <p>"That's very interesting," said Peter. He did not remove his gaze from the
  pale blue eyes. "I know several other people who would like to hear all about
  your good fortune."</p>

  <p>"Finish up your tea and we'll go," said Mr. Bletsall, pushing back his
  chair.</p>

  <p>Peter took one sip and dropped the cup with a crash on to the table. In
  another second he had gripped Bletsall by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," said Mr. Bletsall....</p>

  <p>All the way to Scotland Yard he was babbling of the cars he had bought, of
  the magnificent estate for which he was negotiating, and the millions which
  would be his in the very near future.</p>

  <p>Even a sip of diluted amotoxylene was sufficient to send Peter to bed,
  gripping the sheets convulsively. Superintendent Brissen came round to see
  him in the morning.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">LEE SMITT had no police record and no apparent nationality,
  though he claimed to he American and the claim was not disputed. Certainly he
  had lived in the United States, and it was pretty easy to locate the area,
  for in the early days he had the rapid-fire lingo of the Middle West, which
  is so disconcerting to the leisurely Southerner and a source of amusement in
  New York.</p>

  <p>Red Sanderson was undoubtedly American. and had probably come from English
  stock who were Sanderson in the days when people wrote S's like F's.</p>

  <p>Joe Kelly was just cosmopolitan; he knew Paris, spoke French rather well,
  had seen the inside of two French prisons, and had had a narrow escape of
  taking the rap at Cayenne, which is frequently and inaccurately referred to
  as Devil's Island, for Devil's Island is only a bit of it.</p>

  <p>They came unobtrusively into London in the days when Sergeant Peter Dunn
  was newly come to the Criminal Investigation Department and was sitting at
  the feet of Inspector Sam Allerway, learning his business.</p>

  <p>Peter, as all the world knows, is the only baronet of the United Kingdom
  that ever walked a beat. There were quite a number of people who thought that
  when he succeeded, on his grandfather's death, to his title and fortune, be
  should have retired gracefully from the force.</p>

  <p>A certain lordly relative once expressed this point of view, and Peter
  asked:</p>

  <p>"When you became Lord Whatever-your-name-is did you give up golf?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the staggered aristocrat.</p>

  <p>"Very well then," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I really don't see the connection," said his baffled lordship. "Police
  work isn't a game?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know the half of it," said Peter.</p>

  <p>And here he was, learning his business from Sam Allerway.</p>

  <p>There was nobody more competent to teach a young officer than Sam. He was
  a great detective, the greatest in our generation. He might have reached the
  highest rank, but he drank a little, gambled a lot, and was notoriously in
  debt, and therefore suspect: though Sans had never taken a cent from any
  illicit source in his life.</p>

  <p>There is a popular delusion that high officers at Scotland Yard own rows
  of houses and have considerable investments. No doubt very large presents
  have been made and accepted by grateful citizens who have benefited by the
  genius and prescience of men at Scotland Yard. It is against all regulations,
  but it is not against human nature. Perhaps, if Sam had been offered some big
  presents by the law-abiding people he had helped, he might have accepted
  them, but all his offers had come from the wrong end of the business.</p>

  <p>"You can't learn this too soon. Peter," he said. "The crook's money has
  got two hooks to it&mdash;and those hooks never come out! This doesn't affect
  you, because you've got all the money in the world, and I know just what's
  going to happen to the bird who tries to slip you a monkey for giving him
  five minutes to get out of the house."</p>

  <p>Sam Allerway was never a popular man with his superiors. His acid gibings
  made him no friends. He had a trick of summarising the character and the
  disposition of his chiefs in one biting and uncomplimentary phrase, and, but
  for the fact that he was a brilliant thief-catcher, he would never have
  progressed as far as inspector.</p>

  <p>One of the few people who respected him and understood him was a certain
  J. G. Reeder, who at that time was associated with the Bankers Trust as their
  private detective and investigator; but as Mr. Reeder does not come into this
  story it will be sufficient to sum up the character of Sam Allerway is his
  words.</p>

  <p>"The criminal classes would he well advised." he said. "and be giving no
  more than what is due, if they erected a statue to the man
  who&mdash;um&mdash;introduced old brandy into our country,"</p>

  <p>Old brandy was Sam Alleyway's weakness. But he was perfectly sober on the
  night the Canadian Bank of Commerce was robbed of 530,000 Canadian
  dollars.</p>

  <p>The robbery was effected between five o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and
  seven o'clock on the Sunday morning. Three men had concealed themselves in an
  office immediately above the bank premises. The Canadian Bank of Commerce was
  situated in a large corner block facing Trafalgar Square.</p>

  <p>The lower floor and the basement were entirely occupied by the bankers,
  the five floors above being given over to various businesses, that
  immediately above the bank premises being occupied by an insurance company.
  The block had been specially built, and was the bank's property. Between the
  insurance office and the banking department was a concrete floor which was
  further strengthened by an iron grid set in the centre of the solid
  concrete.</p>

  <p>On the day of the robbery Trafalgar Square was filled with an organised
  demonstration of the unemployed. Parties arrived front various parts of
  London, each headed by a band and carrying their banners and slogans. All the
  police reserves were gathered to deal with possible disturbances,</p>

  <p>Another favourable circumstance for the burglars was that a section of the
  roadway before the bank was being torn up to deal with a faulty gas main. All
  that afternoon, with the indifferent music of the brass bands there had
  mingled the staccato rattle of automatic road-breakers.</p>

  <p>There could be no question that pneumatic drills were also used by the
  burglars, and that they synchronised their operations with those of the
  workmen outside. The concrete ceiling was broken through immediately above
  the manager's office, which was locked, and to which the two watchmen on the
  premises had no access.</p>

  <p>As to whether there were two watchmen present or not when the floor was
  pierced is a question which has never been satisfactorily settled. Both men
  swore they were on the premises, but it is almost certain that one of them
  went out far an hour, and during that hour the thieves got into the manager's
  room, unlocked the door on the inside, slugged the one remaining watchman,
  whom they surprised as he was looking through the plate-glass window at the
  demonstrators, and tied him up.</p>

  <p>The second watchman was knocked out near the side entrance of the bank,
  and in circumstances which suggested that he must have come in from the
  outside at some time in the afternoon, since there was no hiding place where
  his attackers could wait, except behind the door.</p>

  <p>The two men were blindfolded before they were tied up and gagged. They
  were unable to give any description of the burglars, and, but for the
  circumstance that the first man had been blindfolded with one of the robber's
  own handkerchiefs, which bore a laundry mark, no evidence at all might have
  been secured that would convict them or even give the police is reasonable
  clue.</p>

  <p>The three men had an excellent kit of tools. They were able to open the
  vault door, cut through the bars of an inner grille, and remove every scrap
  of currency in the vault.</p>

  <p>Every hour the bank was closed a patrolling policeman, passing the side
  entrance of the bank, pressed a small bell-push and waited till he received
  an answering clang from a bell set in the wall. Evidently the thieves knew
  the bank method thoroughly, for he and his relief received all the signals
  until eight o'clock. At that hour, when the policeman pressed the bell he
  received no answer. He tried again, but with no further success, and in
  accordance with practice he reported the fact to headquarters at Cannon Row,
  which is Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>He then made his way to the front of the bank and peered in. Two lights
  were burning, as usual, and there was no sign that anything was wrong. He
  rapped on the front door, received no answer, and waited here until a squad
  car came from headquarters, carrying his immediate chief, and, what was more
  important, duplicate keys of the bank, which were kept at Cannon Row in a
  case, the glass of which had to be smashed before they could be taken
  out.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the robbery was immediately made. One of the two watchmen
  was sent off to hospital in an ambulance, the second taken to the station for
  questioning. Within half an hour the big chiefs of Scotland Yard were at the
  bank, making their investigations, and Allerway was allocated to the
  case.</p>

  <p>"This is not an English job," he said, when he made an inspection of the
  tools. "It is a Yankee crowd or a French crowd, and it's nine to one in
  favour of America."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said his chief, who did not like him (he was afterwards
  dismissed for incompetence by the Kenley Commission) "you're going on the
  fact that the tools are American-made? Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're English-made." said Allerway, "as you would have seen if the Lord
  had given you good eyesight and you weren't too lazy to look."</p>

  <p>Allerway used to talk like this to chief inspectors, and that was why he
  was not particularly popular.</p>

  <p>He began his search like the workman he was. By the Monday morning he had
  identified Red Fanderson as the owner of the handkerchief. He had a room off
  the Waterloo Bridge Road, and a search of this led Allerway to a very
  high-class hotel in the West End and to. the discovery of a gentlemanly guest
  who had left on the previous day after ostentatiously labelling his baggage
  for Canada.</p>

  <p>Here Allerway had a lucky break. There had been staying in the hotel a
  Southern European royalty, who had been photographed by a newspaper man as he
  left the hotel one morning. Quite unconsciously Mr. Lee Smitt, who had also
  chosen that moment to leave the hotel, had appeared in the background. With
  him had vanished his valet, Joseph Kelly, pleasantly spoken, a favourite in
  the couriers' room and quite a modest personality.</p>

  <p>The police throughout the country were warned. A week later Sam picked up
  a new clue. A man answering Lee Smitt's description had purchased a
  second-hand car, and had it registered in the name of Gray. He had chosen an
  American car of a very popular make.</p>

  <p>"The number-plate&mdash;" began the garage man.</p>

  <p>"You can forget the number-plate: he's got another one by now," said
  Sam.</p>

  <p>It was Peter Dunn's first big case, and he was thrilled. He hardly got any
  sleep in the first week of the chase, and on the night the three men were
  located he was ready to drop; but the news that the car had been seen passing
  through Slough galvanised him to life.</p>

  <p>It was a foul night; rain was pouring in buckets. and a gale of wind was
  sweeping up front the south-west. They picked up the trail at Maidenhead,
  lost it again at Reading, cut back to Henley without any greater success. At
  six o'clock in the morning the car was seen at Andover, and a barrage laid
  down, but Lee doubled back towards Guildford. It was on the Guildford Road
  that they came head to head, the squad car and that which carried the wanted
  men. Lee tried to dart past, but the squad driver rammed him.</p>

  <p>There was in the police car, besides the driver, only Peter Dunn and
  Inspector Sam Allerway, but the three men offered no resistance.</p>

  <p>Peter took charge of the prisoners and Sam drove the car back. They
  stopped at a little wayside inn, and here Sam searched the car. He found
  nothing in the shape of property. There were two suitcases, containing the
  belongings of the prisoners. but no money.</p>

  <p>It was curious, the number of people who had seen Leo Smitt and his three
  companions, if not leaving the bank carrying a suitcase, at least in the
  vicinity of the bank. Yet they might have escaped conviction on the ground of
  insufficient evidence if Sam Allerway had not dug up from a railway luggage
  room a duplicate set of bank-smashing tools. It was on this evidence that the
  three men went down for twelve years.</p>

  <p>It was this evidence which spurred Lee Smitt to make his remarkable
  statement, that in the car when he was captured were four packages of
  Canadian currency valued $60,000. Smitt told the judge that Sam had promised
  to make it light for him if he could slip these in his pocket and forget
  them. It was a crude lie. Peter Dunn stood in the court, raging. But it was
  one of those lies which had possibilities. People read the account and said:
  "Well, I wonder.... ?" There was a departmental inquiry. Sam Allerway was
  crushed, beaten. He turned up for the meeting of the board, drunk and
  truculent, and was dismissed the force.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later they picked his body out of the Thames.</p>

  <p>Two years after that Peter Dunn was the principal witness at another staff
  inquiry, and the chief inspector who had been responsible for Allerway's ruin
  was dismissed with ignominy, and narrowly escaped a term of imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Where was the bulk of the money taken from the Canadian Bank of Commerce?
  Scotland Yard thought it had been sent abroad, divided into thousands of
  small sums and sent through the post to an American address. It was a simple
  method of disposing of paper currency. and practically undetectable.</p>

  <p>Interrogated at intervals at Dartmoor, Lee Smitt hinted that this had been
  the method of disposal. But there were shrewd men at Scotland Yard who
  pointed out that at the time the money had been stolen the men had been
  fugitives, and that there had been a special watch placed by the post office
  on all bulky packages addressed to the United States.</p>

  <p>Peter's own report on the case is worth quoting.</p>

  <p>"These three men arrived in England six months before the robbery, which
  was not only perfectly planned, but their get away was as skilfully arranged.
  They had a car to take them to the coast, but this was damaged in a
  collision; otherwise the second car would not have been purchased. Lee Smitt
  is a man with an American police record: he was concerned in three bank
  robberies, was sentenced to from five to twenty years in Sing-Sing. but was
  released on a technicality when the case went to the Appellate Court. He is a
  man of brilliant education and there is no evidence that he had any
  confederate in the United States. Every important bank in America has
  complied with the request of Scotland Yard to render an account of suspicious
  deposits made by mail from England, and nothing out of the ordinary has been
  discovered."</p>

  <p>Nine years later the three men were released from Dartmoor, escorted to
  Southampton and put on a boat bound for the United States. The New York
  police reported their arrival. And that, so far as Peter Dunn was concerned,
  was the end of the case.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was in the late summer of the next year that he became
  acquainted with the Death Watch, and in the strangest and most unusual
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn was taking a vacation. His idea of a vacation was to hire a
  little cabin cruiser and move leisurely from Kingston to Oxford, camping at
  night by any promising meadow, stopping at the towns to purchase his
  supplies, and, with the aid of a gramophone and a small library of books
  which he brought with him, pass the evenings that separated him front the
  morning's plunge in the river and another day of progress through a
  procession of locks towards the historic city he knew so well.</p>

  <p>Between Lockton and Bourne End the hills rise steeply. It is a wild and a
  not particularly cheerful spot in the daytime. He arrived at his anchorage
  late at night, tied up to the weedy bank, pulled down the fly-proof shutters
  of his cabin and cooked his evening meal.</p>

  <p>It was not a night which attracted holiday-makers to the river. A drizzle
  of rain was falling; a chill wind blew down the river, and when the sun set
  he was glad to pull on an extra warm pullover. He did not know this part of
  the river at all, and had a feeling that it was some distance from a road. He
  neither saw motor-car lights nor heard the hum of engines.</p>

  <p>Peter cursed the English summer, pulled close the door of his little
  cabin, and spent ten minutes destroying such inquisitive flying things us had
  found their way into the interior.</p>

  <p>He was trying to read a German work on criminal practice, but found it
  difficult to keep his eyes open. At nine o'clock he got into his pyjamas,
  extinguished the little reading lamp and slipped into bed.</p>

  <p>He was not a heavy sleeper, but certain notes woke him more quickly than
  others. He could sleep through the heavy rumble of traffic and the sound of
  deep-throated klaxon horns, but a shrill note amidst the noise would wake him
  instantly.</p>

  <p>He was awake before he realised he had been asleep. it was a woman's
  scream: there was no doubt about it. He heard it repeated, and tumbled out of
  his bunk, listening. It was a scream of terror&mdash;somebody was in,
  horrible fear.</p>

  <p>He pulled a waterproof coat over his pyjamas, pushed open the door of the
  cabin and came out to the little well deck. Somebody was crashing through the
  undergrowth, He heard a woman's sobs.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" he called.</p>

  <p>Going into the cabin, he found his hand torch and sent a powerful beam
  into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The girl who was found by the light stood, terrified, staring towards him.
  She was in her nightdress and an old, discoloured robe. Her hair was awry.
  The round, moon-like face was distorted with fear.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Evidently something in his voice reassured her, for she came scrambling
  down the steep bank.</p>

  <p>"Don't come any farther. I'll pull my boat in. What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer until he had grabbed the mooring rope and drawn the
  stern of the boat into the bank. The hand he took was deadly cold, and she
  was shivering from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Get me away out of here&mdash;get me away quickly!" she sobbed. "That
  horrible thing....! I wouldn't stay another night.... I heard the death
  watch, too, and I told Mr. Hannay and he only laughed."</p>

  <p>"You've seen something disagreeable, have you?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>He had taken her to his cabin and put a rug around her. An unprepossessing
  young woman, he classified her without difficulty, and when she told him
  later that she was a housemaid he was rather surprised that she had attained
  even to that position.</p>

  <p>He had some hot coffee in a thermos flask, which he had put away against
  his early morning breakfast. He gave her this, and she became more
  coherent.</p>

  <p>"I work in Mr. Hannay's house, sir.... it used to be one of Diggin's
  Follies, You know the place."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know the place," said Peter. "Who is Mr. Hannay?"</p>

  <p>She was very vague about Mr. Hannay. except that he was a rich gentleman
  "in the drapery".</p>

  <p>Apparently it was the death watch that worried her. She had heard it again
  and again. Two other servants had left, because, when the death watch
  sounded, something always happened. She had heard the click-click-click of it
  in the wall.</p>

  <p>"When you hear that somebody's going to die."</p>

  <p>"I know the superstition," said Peter with a smile. "It's a little beetle
  and he's quite harmless."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not here, sir." She was very serious. "When you hear the death watch at
  Chesterford something always happens."</p>

  <p>Peter heard a voice hailing the boat from the bank and went outside. He
  saw a tall, thin man who carried a torch in his hand,.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a girl?" asked a booming voice.</p>

  <p>"I've got her here yes," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. Hannay, of Chesterford." The voice had a certain pomposity and
  self-importance. "One of those stupid servants has been making a fuss because
  she heard the death watch and thought she saw something... she ran out of the
  house before I could stop her."</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir"&mdash;the girl had come out of the cabin and stood
  behind Peter&mdash; "I was so frightened, sir."</p>

  <p>"Come back to the house immediately," said Hannay's voice. "Really, it is
  too absurd of you, making me ridiculous and making yourself ridiculous.
  Ghosts! Whoever heard of ghosts?"</p>

  <p>"l saw it, sir "</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" said Mr, Hannay. "Come along, I'll take you back to the
  house."</p>

  <p>Peter was a little relieved. He had no particular desire to accommodate a
  young lady for the remainder of the night. His little clock told him it was
  just after midnight, and he did not relish the prospect of sitting up all
  night with a companion whose only topic of conversation was ghosts and death
  watches. He helped the girl to the shore.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Mr.&mdash; um &mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Peter did not oblige him with his name. He was glad when the girl had
  gone, but for an hour he lay, turning from side to side in his bunk,
  speculating upon this strange little adventure. Death watch? Ghosts? He
  smiled.</p>

  <p>He was just dozing off when there came another interruption. He got out of
  bed and again went out of the cabin, not in too good a temper. The man on the
  bank had no lantern.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir, are you the gentleman that gave shelter to Lily?"</p>

  <p>For a reason best known to himself Peter went suddenly cold.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"She took away your rug. Mr. Hannay asked use to return it to you."</p>

  <p>All Peter's irritation was gone now. Dimly he could see the man on the
  bank. He had left his lantern in the cabin, but evidently the man on the bank
  could see him "Will you catch, sir?"</p>

  <p>Something was thrown at him; the soft mass of the rug struck him in the
  chest.</p>

  <p>"Have you got it? Good night, sir."</p>

  <p>The man went scrambling up the steep path to the invisible house. Peter
  stood for a long time, the rain pattering, on the shoulders of his
  waterproof.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>He went back to the cabin, switched on the light and sat down:</p>

  <p>"Who the dickens was Diggin?" he asked aloud at the end of an hour of
  thought. "And what was his peculiar brand of folly?"</p>

  <p>He left his moorings just after daybreak, stopped at Marlow and went
  ashore, and at that unearthly hour engaged a room at the <i>Red Lion</i>,
  where he finished his interrupted sleep. At ten o'clock his boat was still
  moored at the big boathouse, and Peter was pursuing inquiries.</p>

  <p>Diggin was a builder, long since dead. He had conceived the idea of
  building two villas on the crests of two identical hills. They were not good
  villas, but they were very precious in the sight of Mr. Diggin, who had been
  both the architect and the builder. They suffered from this disadvantage,
  that they were near no main road, were indeed almost unapproachable, since in
  the days when they were built the motor-car was an unknown method of
  transport. They were red brick villas, with bow windows and slate roofs,
  altogether unlovely, and they were called "Diggin's Follies" because nobody
  wanted to buy them or hire them. Even the advent of the motor-car did not
  make them any more desirable.</p>

  <p>The week before his death Mr. Diggin had sold one and the land on which it
  stood to a man who intended starting it poultry farm. He had never started
  it. The second, and more important, sale was conducted by Mr. Diggin's
  executor, and the purchaser was Mr. Hannay, who had so built on to this villa
  that it had lost its native ugliness and had attained the dignity of a
  country home. "In fact, Chesterford is one of the nicest houses in these
  parts." said Peter's informant. "It has beautiful grounds, a bathing pool and
  everything."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay apparently was a wholesale draper who had passed his
  responsibilities on to a limited liability company in the days when company
  promoters were paying enormous sums for likely propositions. He had one
  child, a daughter&mdash;her name was Patricia. Peter had a glimpse of her,
  driving a big Rolls through the town. She wore a blue tennis jacket and a
  gaily coloured scarf about her throat. Her head was bare and her brown hair
  was flying in all directions. Pretty, he thought; but then, Peter had this
  weakness, that he believed most women were pretty.</p>

  <p>His very discreet inquiries produced no stories of ghosts&mdash;at least,
  no ghosts attached to Chesterford. Yet something peculiar was happening in
  Mr. Hannay 's house. Servants were leaving; few stayed there more than a
  week&mdash;this he learned at a local employment agency. The butler had left
  a month before and had been replaced. Two cooks had left in one week; there
  had been five new maids in the house in the past two months.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay was a gentleman of irreproachable character. He was rich, a
  churchgoer, had a large electric canoe and two cars. Obviously he was not a
  flighty man; a plain, matter of fact, sober, rather intolerant citizen, so
  far as Peter could make out. There had been some feeling locally because, at
  a recent Parliamentary election, he had discharged two gardeners who had had
  the temerity to vote for the Labour candidate, and very foolishly had boasted
  of their fell deed.</p>

  <p>He was. in fact. the kind of man one might meet in any small English town,
  who believed that the country was going to the devil and that something ought
  to be done about it.</p>

  <p>Three days of his vacation Peter gave up to a little private
  investigation. He went near enough to the house to catch a glimpse of Miss
  Patricia driving the yellow Rolls, and was considerably impressed.</p>

  <p>The household, he discovered, consisted of Mr. Hannay and his daughter, a
  working butler named Higgins, two maids. one of whom had left in a
  hurry&mdash;Peter supposed this was his terrified guest&mdash;and a
  gardener-chauffeur who had recently been engaged.</p>

  <p>Peter made a very careful survey of the grounds, but did not approach the
  house. It was easier to examine the second of Mr. Diggin's Follies, for the
  red brick villa stood more or less as it had been delivered from its maker's
  hands: an atrocity of a building, gaunt, desolate. It stood in two acres of
  untidy ground. No attempt had been made to form a garden; the weeds were
  knee-high; the windows blurred with the rains and dust of years. In one part
  of the field&mdash;it was little more&mdash;he found the old chicken huts
  that had been delivered years before and had been stacked at the back of the
  house. The weather had taken toll of them: most of them had fallen to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>He cleaned a pane of glass with his handkerchief and stared into an empty
  room, the walls of which had been covered with a paper of atrocious pattern.
  It was peeling from the walls, and as he stared he saw a little brown form
  whisk across the floor and disappear into a cavity which he identified as the
  fire grate.</p>

  <p>"Rats and rubbish," said Peter.</p>

  <p>He tried the doors, front and back: they were locked. At the back door he
  thought he saw the trace of a footprint, but this was not remarkable: the
  people in the neighbourhood often came over to stare at Diggin's Folly; they
  overran the surrounding ground, and would have picnicked there if its bleak
  character had encouraged such a frivolity,</p>

  <p>About twenty years before, the gloomy house had gained notoriety as the
  scene of a very commonplace murder. A tramp woman had been murdered by
  another wanderer of the road, who had long since fallen through the trap in
  expiation of his crime. It was when he was making inquiries about this
  deserted place that Peter heard the first hint of a ghost.</p>

  <p>The place was reputedly haunted, or had enjoyed that reputation till the
  public grew tired of its mystery. Yet Peter discovered an elderly man who had
  seen the old tramp woman walking in the grounds of the house, wringing her
  hands and moaning.</p>

  <p>"I admit I'd been drinking that night," said his informant, "but I know
  when I've had enough."</p>

  <p>"That," said Peter. "is a more common illusion than ghosts."</p>

  <p>He had three weeks vacation. Nearly a week of it was gone. He went up to
  Scotland Yard and saw his chief. "Surely, you can have six weeks if you want
  it. It's due to you, but you told me that three would be sufficient?" Peter
  explained that he needed the rest. He had just finished with an important and
  tiring case, and the extra leave was granted.</p>

  <p>He had another object in coming to town. He collected his car. Peter Dunn
  was a rich man. It was the Complaint of Scotland Yard that he ought not to be
  there at all.</p>

  <p>He came back this time to Maidenhead. He did not want to be at Marlow too
  long, and with his car the question of distance was no object.</p>

  <p>It was not to be supposed that his presence in the immediate neighbourhood
  of Chesterford should pass unnoticed. After dinner one night Pat Hannay asked
  a question.</p>

  <p>"A young man? Good heavens, I don't notice young men! One of the maid's
  admirers&mdash;that new girl Joyce is rather pretty."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look like a maid's admirer," said Pat. "In fact, I cherish the
  romantic impression that he might be waiting to catch a glimpse of me."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said her father.</p>

  <p>"You're very rude," said Pat, and then: "Do you realise that we know
  hardly anybody in this neighbourhood? We've got a lovely tennis court that
  nobody plays tennis on, and even my London friends do not come to
  Chesterford."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay looked at her in amazement,</p>

  <p>"Why on earth do you want people here?" he said. "Half the delight of the
  country is that one is alone."</p>

  <p>"It isn't half my delight or even a quarter of it," said Patricia Hannay,
  and went on without a pause: "He was rather nice-looking."</p>

  <p>"Who was?" asked her baffled father. "Oh, the young man you saw?
  Well"&mdash;heavily jocose&mdash;"why don't you ask him to play tennis with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of that," said Pat, and then struck a more serious note. "You
  know the cook has left?"</p>

  <p>"Has she?" said Mr. Hannay in astonishment. "I thought tonight's dinner
  was extraordinarily good&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I cooked it," said Pat. "It was rather fun, but if I did it more than
  twice it would be a bore. Daddy. do you realise what an awfully ugly house
  this is?"</p>

  <p>She was touching Mr. Hannay's tenderest point. He Was an amateur
  architect. It was his boast that he had designed the additions that had
  turned a villa that was plain to the point of ugliness into something which
  bore a resemblance to a charming, country house.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that the architecture's ugly," said Pat, hastily tactful,
  "but it's so isolated, and I can almost understand the servants getting ideas
  about ghosts and groanings and rappings. Why don't you let it, daddy? That
  was a magnificent offer you had the other day,"</p>

  <p>"Let it?" scoffed Mr. Hannay. "Absurd! It would
  be&mdash;um&mdash;derogatory to my position. I can't let furnished houses. I
  either close them up or sell them. I was saying to Dr. Herzoff at the
  club&mdash;he's an excellent player; in fact, I had all my work cut out to
  beat him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She had heard of Dr. Herzoff before.</p>

  <p>"Is he living at the club-house?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know where he's living&mdash;at some hotel in the neighbourhood.
  A charming. fellow, with a tremendous sense of humour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which means he laughs at your jokes and hasn't heard your ancient
  stories, daddy. Does he play tennis?" Hannay thought he might.</p>

  <p>After tea the neat night Pat strolled out down to the lower garden. Beyond
  the trim box hedge ran a road which had not been a road at all until Mr.
  Hannay had made it. It was here she had seen the mysterious young man who had
  excited her interest. She wondered what he would say if, with the boldness of
  despair, she invited him to a game of singles. She was a little disappointed
  that she had not the opportunity of making this test.</p>

  <p>That night there came a crisis in the affairs of Chesterford. Pat was in
  that pleasant stage between sleep. and wakefulness when she heard a shrill
  outcry. She sat up in bed. listening. From somewhere near at hand she heard a
  "click-click-click," and, despite her philosophy. shivered. The death watch!
  She had heard it before, but not quite so distinct. Again came the scream.
  She reached for her dressing-gown and slipped out of bed. In another second
  she was in the corridor.</p>

  <p>The maid's room was at the end of the passage. She tried the door; it was
  locked, but the. incoherent babble of sound which came from within told her
  she had not made any mistake.</p>

  <p>Mr, Hannay had heard the cry. Pat turned her head at the snap of his lock.
  He came out, a gaunt figure, more exasperated than frightened.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's the matter?" he asked,</p>

  <p>Pat did not answer, She was rattling the handle of the maid's door.</p>

  <p>"Joyce! Joyce! What is the matter? Open the door." The key turned and the
  door opened, Joyce stood there in her nightgown. her eyes staring wildly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, miss, I saw it!" she gasped. "I saw it as plainly as...."</p>

  <p>"Saw what?"</p>

  <p>Pat brushed past her into the room, closing the door, The girl fell back
  on the edge of her bed. her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>"What did you see?" asked Pat again.</p>

  <p>For a little time the maid did not speak.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to pass through the door, miss," she said in a hollow tone.
  "and I locked the door before I came to bed. It walked slowly past me and
  sort of disappeared.... it was almost as if it walked through the wall.</p>

  <p>"It was a nightmare," said Pat, her heart quaking. Joyce shook her head
  vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, miss, it wasn't. There was no nightmare about that. It happened.
  just as the other girls said it happened. And I wasn't asleep; I was wide
  awake&mdash;as much awake as I am at this very minute."</p>

  <p>Pat meditated for a second. She simply dared not ask any more questions:
  this type of terror grew on what it fed on. Then her natural curiosity
  overcame her discretion.</p>

  <p>"What was it like?"</p>

  <p>"A horrible-looking man. He had a terrible face. Dressed in tramp's
  clothes.... dirty-looking.... he was awful. There was blood on his hands: it
  seemed to be dripping as he walked!"</p>

  <p>Pat looked at her helplessly, then went to the dour and opened it.</p>

  <p>May my father come in?"</p>

  <p>Hannay was standing outside.</p>

  <p>"Joyce says she saw a ghost&mdash;a tramp or something, with blood On his
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Stuff and nonsense!" growled Mr. Hannay. "She must have been
  dreaming."</p>

  <p>The maid looked up at him resentfully.</p>

  <p>"It's not stuff and nonsense, sir, and I've not been dreaming."</p>

  <p>She got up suddenly from the bed, walked to the window, and, drawing aside
  the thick curtains, peered out. Pat saw her draw back, an expression of
  horror on her face. "Look!"</p>

  <p>Hannay pushed her out of the way, and, throwing open the casement window,
  thrust out his head. Then a chill ran down his spine, for he saw the man
  distinctly. He was tall, grotesque in the moonlight, a figure that moved and
  made strange and hideous noises as it walked.</p>

  <p>"That's him," quavered Joyce. "Do you hear? That was what I heard....
  quite near, miss!"</p>

  <p>There was perplexity on Hannay's face, anxiety on Pat's. Twitching terror
  on the face of the maid. Pat supposed. With a quiet malice, that the girl
  found some enjoyment in her terror&mdash;was at least laying the foundation
  for horrific stories to be told to her friends.</p>

  <p>"I was wide awake. He came so close to me I could have touched
  him...."</p>

  <p>She seemed loth to leave the subject.</p>

  <p>"What did he look like?" asked Mr. Hannay.</p>

  <p>"She's told you once." said Pat impatiently.</p>

  <p>But Joyce was not to be denied her narrative.</p>

  <p>"His face was horrible!" She shuddered. "Like a man who was dead!"</p>

  <p>"Come into the library." said Pat to her father. She turned to the
  maid.</p>

  <p>"You'd better wake up Peterson and ask him to give you something hot to
  drink."</p>

  <p>They left the girl sitting on the edge of the bed, covering her face with
  her hands. Mr. Hannay led the way, walking to his desk in the library. It was
  the one spot in the house where he could command any situation. And here was
  a situation which asked for command. Yet, as was his wont, he waited for a
  lead from his daughter. Mr. Hannay initiated nothing. He found the weak place
  in the suggestions of others, and by this process, which operated throughout
  his life, he had amassed a fortune.</p>

  <p>"Father, we've got to do something."</p>

  <p>Nobody knew this better than Mr. Hannay.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you expect me to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was an obvious solution, and she suggested it.</p>

  <p>"Send for the police." she said.</p>

  <p>Her father snorted.</p>

  <p>"And make myself a laughing stock! Police&mdash;ghosts! I've never heard
  such nonsense! Don't you suppose that that idea has already been considered
  by me and rejected?"</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do about it?" she asked squarely. "Daddy, I can't go
  on; this thing is getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>It was getting on Mr. Hannay's nerves also.</p>

  <p>"It is all very stupid," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause as he thought, his head on his hands.</p>

  <p>"That man, I met at the golf club.... Professor Herzoff&mdash;he's a very
  well-known scientist. Have you heard of him?"</p>

  <p>Patricia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Neither have I," admitted Hannay naively. "It's very odd, we were talking
  about ghosts. I don't know what fool brought it up. He believes in them."</p>

  <p>Pat stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Is he grown up.... and believes in ghosts?"</p>

  <p>"He's grown up and believes in ghosts," said Hannay firmly. "I'll bring
  him over tomorrow morning. He might give us a new angle to the
  situation."</p>

  <p>It was not the first time Mr. Hannay had evaded the big issue. Always
  tomorrow something would be done. Pat sighed.</p>

  <p>"I want a new cook to the situation," she said. "That's the third servant
  we've lost in a fortnight. After all, these people <i>have</i> seen
  things."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," said Mr. Hannay irritably. "It's all imagination.
  Ghosts&mdash;bah! Death watches&mdash;rubbish!" She held up her finger to
  enjoin silence. From some. where near at hand the death watch was tapping
  rhythmically, noisily, ominously.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. HERZOFF&mdash;when he was called "Professor" he
  generally protested&mdash;was a man of middle height, spare of frame,
  delicately featured. His hair was grey; his long, rather sensitive face
  almost colourless. Behind his horn-rimmed glasses were a pair of dark eyes,
  and the stare of these could be very disconcerting.</p>

  <p>It was generally believed at the Mansion Golf Club that he was wealthy. He
  used to speak disparagingly of his little house at Weisseldorf, but from what
  he said once they gathered that his little house was a respectable-sized
  castle.</p>

  <p>His appearances at the club were of a fugitive character. He had been a
  member for many years, but when he made his last appearance the staff had
  almost entirely changed. He played a good game of golf, was quiet, unassuming
  and an authority on almost every kind of subject from economics to wild game
  hunting.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay found him singularly sympathetic when, a little shamefacedly
  and with understandable hesitation, he broached this question of the
  supernatural.</p>

  <p>The professor must come over and see his house. Mr. Hannay was very proud
  of Chesterford, and never tired of exhibiting it. Most people who accepted
  his invitation had gone away unimpressed. Mr. Herzoff, on the other hand,
  stood before the house and pointed out certain admirable features of
  architecture which its designer had never noticed before. Mr. Hannay, with
  some pride, personally conducted his guest through the house. They came at
  last to a drawing-room which owed much of its loveliness, if the truth be
  told, to the insistence of the builder upon certain characteristics, for
  which Mr. Herzoff now took all the credit.</p>

  <p>"If I may express the opinion, it's a very beautiful home," said Mr.
  Herzoff.</p>

  <p>Hannay agreed.</p>

  <p>"All that panelling came out of the Duke of&mdash;well, I forget his name,
  but anyway he was a duke; had a chateau in France. I've had big offers to let
  it, but no, sir! A man from London was up here a month ago, trying to get it.
  He told me to write my own cheque."</p>

  <p>"I can understand your reluctance," said Herzoff politely, and waited for
  the story which had been promised him. "You say something happened here last
  night?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you," he said. "There have been some queer things
  happening here. At least, these servants say so. I tell 'em that the death
  watch is all nonsense. It's a little beetle that gets into the wood and
  starts knocking to attract the attention of the female beetle." Mr. Herzoff
  smiled. He knew the insect.</p>

  <p>"That is what it has all grown out of," said Hannay. "They think the
  tapping means somebody's going to die. That is the superstition. You get one
  or two hysterical girls around the place and they'll imagine anything."</p>

  <p>Mr. Herzoff appeared thoroughly interested.</p>

  <p>"What have they heard or what have they seen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay explained.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in it&mdash;understand that. They must have left the
  wireless on one night. They heard voices talking&mdash;people quarrelling.
  Then the old cook saw a man walking on the lawn. Some down and out looking
  around for a place to sleep, I imagine. Last night the maid saw him
  again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Herzoff frowned. His dark eyes focused upon his host, Evidently he was
  impressed.</p>

  <p>"They heard people quarrelling&mdash;a man and a woman? That's queer," he
  said. "That's queer," he said. "That's very queer!"</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Hannay, alarmed.</p>

  <p>The professor did not attempt to explain what he meant. He asked one or
  two questions. What time was it at night when this quarrelling was heard?
  When he was told eleven, he started.</p>

  <p>"Is there any significance in that?" asked Mr. Hannay anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No," said the other slowly. "Only I would rather like to he here at
  eleven o'clock one night."</p>

  <p>"Would you?" asked Hannay eagerly. "I was hoping you would offer to do
  that. I'll have your things brought over from the hotel."</p>

  <p>Mr. Herzoff hesitated for a fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>"You'd be doing me a favour," Hannay went on. "I'll tell you the truth,
  Mr. Herzoff. All this talk about ghosts and voices is getting
  me&mdash;er&mdash;rather worried."</p>

  <p>Herzoff looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to believe for one moment that I am an authority on the
  occult. I have dabbled in it just a little, as every scientist must.
  Generally speaking, all this ghost business has a very simple explanation.
  Either somebody is trying to fool you or somebody is lying to you. If you see
  it yourselves, that is quite another matter, but it is not conclusive. If you
  think your daughter won't object to my staying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She'll be delighted," said Hannay with great heartiness.</p>

  <p>Pat had been into Marlow, shopping, and was approaching Quarry Hill when
  there shot out of the Henley Road a business like little racing car. She
  swerved violently to the left and jammed on her brakes. hot with annoyance,
  not unconscious of the fact that she herself had been travelling at a very
  good speed.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn, who drove the offending car, stopped within a few inches of
  her running board and eyed her reproachfully,</p>

  <p>"There is a notice, telling you to go slow," said Pat indignantly. "Can't
  you read?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; I can do almost everything but read," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>She was breathless, still angry, yet mindful of the fact that here within
  a few feet of her sat the mysterious young man whose constant appearances
  near the house had excited her interest.</p>

  <p>"You might have killed me." she said.</p>

  <p>"I might have killed myself, which is also important." His callousness and
  effrontery took her remaining breath.</p>

  <p>"Very charmingly put." she said, maintaining her politeness with
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry to have frightened you," he said, and that was
  exasperating.</p>

  <p>"I'm not frightened! Do you mind backing your car so that I can go
  on?"</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to move.</p>

  <p>"Can't you go on unless I back my car?" he asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see?"</p>

  <p>She was furious with him.</p>

  <p>He nodded,</p>

  <p>"Well, do something. please!"</p>

  <p>And then he asked a surprising question.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you Miss Patricia Hannay?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name, yes," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! What a bit of luck! You're the one person in the world I
  wanted to meet, My name is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know your name," she said haughtily.</p>

  <p>"The first name is Peter&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I'm thrilled," she said. "Will you please back your car?"</p>

  <p>Peter's gesture was one of despair.</p>

  <p>"May I make a confession? This is a new car, and I don't know how it
  works. I only know the self-starter and the brake."</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound true, does it? Well, it isn't, Before I back I want to
  ask you something, Miss Hannay, and first I want to apologise to you for
  giving you such a fright."</p>

  <p>"If you imagine I'm frightened by a&mdash;" She hesitated for a word.</p>

  <p>"Say it," he said gently. "Don't spare my feelings. 'Brute' was the word
  you were thinking of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't," she said tartly and looked round.</p>

  <p>A car was behind her, waiting to pass.</p>

  <p>"We're holding up the traffic."</p>

  <p>But he was indifferent.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet nothing frightens you&mdash;bad driving, collisions
  &mdash;ghosts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused inquiringly, and saw her start.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;ghosts?" she said, a little breathlessly. "What do
  you know?"</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I was in a boat the other night. One of your maids came flying down the
  hill, babbling of bogeys."</p>

  <p>She did not reply, but just stared at him. And then:</p>

  <p>"Will you let me go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He put his car into reverse and drew clear, and her machine jerked forward
  and went flying up Quarry Hill. Peter followed at a more leisurely pace, but
  when he came to the open road at the top she was out of sight.</p>

  <p>So that was the man....? She was not quite sure of him. Usually she could
  place men, especially young men, but for the moment he eluded classification.
  He was not unpleasant, but she resented his assurance, which made her feel
  something of a fool, certainly a little on the inferior side.</p>

  <p>As she came up the drive to Chesterford she saw a stranger standing by her
  father's side under the white portico, but she instantly recognised him by
  the description her father had given as the redoubtable Herzoff. Mr. Hannay
  introduced him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm taking advantage of your father's hospitality, Miss
  Hannay&mdash;I am the unexpected guest."</p>

  <p>She smiled at this.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether unexpected. We're rather glad to have you. I hope you
  won't die of indigestion, for the new cook will not be here for two or three
  days."</p>

  <p>Apparently he had been on the point of leaving when she arrived. He was
  driving over to his hotel to collect his baggage. She thought that, if she
  had not known who he was, she would have placed him as a scientist. He was
  what a scientist should look like, she thought. "It will he charming to have
  him, but why is he coming to stay with us just now?" she asked. "By the way.
  does he play tennis?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he doesn't. The fact is, he's rather keen to go into this
  ghost business."</p>

  <p>She made a wry little face as she walked into the house. "Does he know all
  about it, too?"</p>

  <p>"Why 'too' ?" asked Mr. Hannay with a frown, and she told him of her
  adventure.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who this young man is, but apparently the fact that we are
  troubled with ghosts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say 'troubled with ghosts'," said Mr. Hannay irritably. "It sounds
  as though we were troubled with cockroaches."</p>

  <p>"They're worse than cockroaches," said Pat. "Well, he's heard about
  them.... this young man."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" asked Mr. Hannay.</p>

  <p>Patricia, peeling her gloves, sighed impatiently,</p>

  <p>"I don't know, daddy&mdash;he's just a young man. And rather impertinent.
  No, I wouldn't say that&mdash;not impertinent. But he's a little
  unusual."</p>

  <p>"Does he live about here'?"</p>

  <p>She changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"What did you tell Mr. Herzoff?"</p>

  <p>Hannay was rather vague. He had told him about the voices and the people
  talking and the death watch....</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him about the dog that was found dead on the lawn?" she
  asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay winced. That was the one subject that he did not discuss. He
  had bought a dog, a trained police dog, and it had died in most peculiar
  circumstances. Higgins, the new butler, had been the sole witness, and there
  was the dog, stiff on the lawn, to support the testimony. Higgins came in at
  that .moment, a melancholy looking man, with a weakness for taking away
  drinks that had not been drunk and tidying things unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>"You saw it, Higgins?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. miss, I saw it. You were talking about the dog, sir? I don't want to
  see anything like it again."</p>

  <p>"He might have been poisoned," growled Hannay.</p>

  <p>Higgins shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, who could have poisoned him? I was watching him. He walked out
  on to the lawn. I could see him plainly in the moonlight. And then I saw this
  woman in white come out of the trees, and she sort of lifted her hand. The
  old dog howled and just dropped."</p>

  <p>He took his handkerchief from his trousers pocket and dabbed his forehead
  with great precision.</p>

  <p>"And the next minute. sir"&mdash;impressively&mdash;"I heard the death
  watch&mdash;right in my room where there isn't any panelling."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I see it?" asked Hannay irritably, and Higgins looked
  pained.</p>

  <p>"Because. sir, if I may respectfully suggest it, you were asleep, and
  therefore you wasn't looking. And if you was asleep and wasn't looking you
  couldn't see anything. That's been my experience, sir. It's got me, sir." He
  was very serious. "I've been with some of the best families in the country
  and I've never seen anything like this happen." He looked round over his
  shoulder as though he expected to find some supernatural eavesdropper.</p>

  <p>"The house is haunted, sir," he said in a lowered voice.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," snapped Hannay. "I will see just what is going to
  happen."</p>

  <p>Higgins sighed, gathered up the glasses on to a tray and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"You won't see anything unless you keep awake, sir&mdash;that's my
  experience." be said</p>

  <p>"I'll keep awake all right," said Hannay grimly. "Have a bedroom got ready
  for Professor Herzoff, He's coming to stay here tonight."</p>

  <p>When Higgins had gone:</p>

  <p>"The death watch, my dear, as I have explained before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Pat groaned.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;is a little beetle ringing up his girl friend&mdash;I know all
  about that. I learnt it at school," she said.</p>

  <p>She met the new gardener that afternoon. It was no unique experience to
  come across odd people working about the house whom she had never seen
  before. It was less of an experience to meet servants in the morning and find
  they had disappeared by the evening.</p>

  <p>She came across a big man working with a hoe on the edge of the lawn. He
  grinned at her and nodded. He was not a pleasant sight. He had broad
  shoulders and a round, odd-looking head. His features were irregular; he had
  the biggest and ugliest mouth she had ever seen in a man, "Are you the new
  gardener?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He grinned again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss, I am. Name of Standey, I'm a bit new to this place, so you'll
  have to excuse me."</p>

  <p>She remembered then that there had been no flowers in the house for two or
  three days, and told him. There was something about him she did not like. He
  was staring at her with frank admiration. There was in his attitude an
  insolence which she resented.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they want flowers when you're around, miss," he said,
  with clumsy gallantry. "I don't think I am likely to grow anything as pretty
  as you."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, open-eyed. This was a new experience for her, and not a
  particularly pleasant one. "Go up to the house and see the maid," she said
  coldly. "Ask her what flowers she wants."</p>

  <p>He did not stir; he stood, leaning on his hoe, his pale eyes devouring
  her.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going up to get my tea in a minute&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Go up now," she said. and he went reluctantly. She told herself it was
  the sort of thing she must expect if they engaged incompetent servants. The
  man was probably a gardener's labourer who had seized the opportunity of
  promoting himself to a position which he could not adequately fill.</p>

  <p>From the lawn to the box hedge which surround the western confines of the
  property was only a few yards. She was unaware that she had attracted an
  audience, and not until she heard a soft laugh did she turn round quickly. It
  was the young man who called himself Peter.</p>

  <p>"What a lad!" said Peter. "One of the old cave man school."</p>

  <p>Recovering, from her surprise, she looked at him coldly. "He was very
  impertinent," she said. "There seems to be an epidemic of that sort of
  thing."</p>

  <p>Peter grinned.</p>

  <p>"And I am part of the disease?" he said. "Yet the last thing in the world
  I want to be is impertinent. What is his name?"</p>

  <p>She was eyeing him steadily, and there was no encouragement in her
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask him for his card," she said, "and anyway you can't read,"
  she added maliciously.</p>

  <p>Peter grinned again.</p>

  <p>"That was a little joke. I should have explained it at the time. All my
  jokes require an explanatory footnote. As a matter of fact. I am a pretty
  good reader."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is a board on the gate you came through." she said
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Peter. "It says 'Private. Please keep out.' I thought it
  was unnecessarily brusque, even rude." For some reason or other she was
  exasperated; unreasonably, she agreed to herself.</p>

  <p>"You're lucky not to have met the dog&mdash;"she began.</p>

  <p>"He would have been lucky to have met me." said Peter quietly, "I
  understand your dog died with dramatic suddenness after seeing a ghost."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" she gasped-</p>

  <p>"<i>Je sais tout</i>&mdash;French. As a matter of fact, I'm terribly
  interested in your affairs, Miss Hannay. I know it's abominable of me, but I
  can't know too much about you, and if I could only have a talk with you for
  ten minutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The odd thing is that I don't want to talk to you even for one
  minute."</p>

  <p>She saw him look past her and turned her head. Standey, the new gardener,
  was coming away from the house and walking towards her.</p>

  <p>"That isn't odd&mdash;it's inhuman," said Peter. "You ought to be ashamed
  of yourself."</p>

  <p>"Is that all you have to say?" she asked stiffly.</p>

  <p>"You've got a guest coming, haven't you? He dresses for dinner&mdash;one
  of the old Austrian aristocracy."</p>

  <p>She half turned to leave him, but it was not so easy: the temptation was
  to go on talking.</p>

  <p>"The gardener's coming back. Perhaps you'd like to ask him what he wears
  for dinner."</p>

  <p>She saw Peter's face cloud.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I'll wait for your attractive henchman," he said. "You
  and I will meet another time perhaps."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," she said.</p>

  <p>She was a little startled that the fact of the gardener's presence should
  make him withdraw with such speed. What interest did Chesterford have for
  him?</p>

  <p>Later in the afternoon she saw him again. At the western end of the
  property, where the ground began to slope down towards the river, was a thick
  belt of pine trees. Here, even before Mr. Hannay had improved the property,
  was a black wooden hut, which was now used to house the lawn-mower and other
  garden implements. He was standing against this, turning over with the toe of
  his shoe a big heap of mould that was stored there. She hesitated for a
  second and then began walking towards him, but Peter saw her coming, and when
  she had rounded a big rhododendron bush which for the moment obliterated a
  view of the hut, he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He had been very much interested in this heap of earth and in the wheel
  tracks which led from the hut. He'd tried to open the door, but it was
  fastened with a staple and a patent padlock.</p>

  <p>He went to the car he had parked in the side road and drove off. His
  inquiries that morning had located the cook who had recently left. She was
  staying with relations on the Reading road, a stout, placid woman, who was
  very disinclined to discuss her late employer. After a while, however. Peter
  persuaded her to talk.</p>

  <p>She liked Mr. Hannay; she thought Patricia was "a sweet young thing"; but
  for Chesterford itself she had little use.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind burglars and tramps." she said. "but it was these goings on
  at night that worried me. Howlings and shriekings, and people fighting on the
  lawn&mdash; it got so bad, sir, that I couldn't sleep?"</p>

  <p>She believed in the death watch. The demise of her own mother had been
  foretold. She had heard the tick-tick-tick of this mysterious agent, and a
  picture fell from the wall for no reason that was ascertainable.</p>

  <p>"What other noises did you hear at night?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>She had heard a sort of thudding, she said vaguely, as if somebody was
  digging. Then one morning she had come down into her kitchen and found that
  the door had been forced. There were signs of muddy feet on her clean floor,
  Whoever it was had left a key behind.</p>

  <p>"A key?" said Peter quickly. "What sort of a key?" The ex-cook smiled
  broadly.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see it?"</p>

  <p>"Have you got it?" asked Peter eagerly.</p>

  <p>She had brought it away with her as a souvenir of her alarming experience.
  Going out of the room, she came back with an old-fashioned looking key in her
  hand. It had rusted but had been recently cleaned.</p>

  <p>"It didn't belong to any of our doors: we've got those patent little
  locks&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;with flat keys. Yale locks. I meant
  to give it to Mr. Higgins, the new butler who came in, but I forgot.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind if I kept it for a day or two?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>She demurred at this.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I ought to do that. It might open somebody's door,
  and I should feel responsible."</p>

  <p>Ultimately he persuaded her, and he went back with a clue which, he told
  himself, might not be a clue at all.</p>

  <p>When he got back to his room he examined the key carefully. There was no
  maker's name on the handle; it was, in fact, the type of key which fitted a
  lock which was not made nowadays. Then an idea occurred to him, and he sat
  up. It would fit the kind of lock that Mr. Diggin would have chosen.</p>

  <p class="first">THE PROFESSOR came over in the afternoon, and Pat was a
  little startled when she heard that the Professor was dressing for dinner.
  This was unusual: neither Pat nor her father dressed except wren they were
  going out. She hastily changed her dress to match the splendour of their
  guest.</p>

  <p>Since he had arrived Mr. Herzoff had spent his time making a minute
  inspection of every room in the house, including her own. He had followed
  this up by a very careful survey of the grounds; but he had nothing new to
  offer at dinner in the shape of a solution. Since Pat was very human. she was
  pleased with his praise of her dinner. Mr. Herzoff was the most satisfactory
  guest they had had. He liked his room; he thought the view charming. His
  presence at any rate had one pleasing result: no sound disturbed the
  stillness of the house that night, and even the death watch maintained a
  complete silence.</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn spent a long time on the telephone that morning; a longer time
  communing with himself. He strolled through the crowded streets of Maidenhead
  that morning and stopped before a secondhand book-shop Outside were a number
  of shelves on which the gems literature of other ages were displayed. He saw
  one stout volume, read the title and grinned. "Advice to a Young Lady of
  Fashion" was the title. The price was two pence. Peter put the heavy volume
  under his arm, not knowing exactly how his jest might develop.</p>

  <p>It developed unusually, it turned out, for that afternoon be had a sudden
  spasm of panic, and in the centre of that panic aura floated the trim figure
  of a girl who, for some reason or other, had become very important to
  him.</p>

  <p>He spent the afternoon working clumsily, and left just before sunset, with
  the bulky book in his pocket. He waited till dark before he approached
  Diggin's Folly. The gaunt house was an ugly smear against the evening sky
  when he drove his car into its grounds and cautiously approached the
  house.</p>

  <p>Taking from his pocket the key the cook had given him, he inserted it in
  the fatal door. His heart beat a lithe faster when the key turned and the
  door opened to his touch. The hinges did not squeak as he had expected. He
  had sufficient curiosity to stop, after he had strut the door, and examine
  them with his hand-lamp. There was oil there, recently applied.</p>

  <p>He waited, straining his ears, but there was no sound except the scurry of
  tiny feet. Generations of rats had been born and lived in this deserted
  building. Every step he took sent some terrified rodent to cover.</p>

  <p>He went from room to room on the ground floor and found nothing. He
  climbed the stairs that creaked under him, inspected three small rooms and
  found them empty. The door of the fourth was locked.</p>

  <p>From his inside pocket he took a flat leather case, fitted a pick-lock to
  the handle and probed inside the keyhole. Presently the ward shot back; he
  turned the handle and entered.</p>

  <p>Somebody had been living here. There was a table, with three empty china
  jugs and a couple of plates on it. In a cupboard he found two new, empty
  suitcases. Continuing his search, he made a startling discovery. In a
  cupboard. the lock of which he picked, he found, wrapped in oil paper, three
  automatic pistols of heavy calibre. and, stacked near them, six boxes of
  cartridges. He re-wrapped the pistols, locked the cupboard and went out of
  the room, carefully locking the door behind him. He did not go to his car,
  but pushed through the hedge which separated Hannay's property from its
  desolate neighbour.</p>

  <p>The chances of seeing Pat were, he knew, remote, unless he went to the
  house and asked for her, and that was the one thing he did not wish to
  do.</p>

  <p>As he came along the fringe of pines he thought he saw a man crossing the
  lawn towards the gate, and he drew back under cover. Apparently he had been
  seen, for the man stopped, and Peter sensed rather than saw that he was
  looking in his direction.</p>

  <p>He could see the light in the drawing-room. Evidently dinner had finished.
  Peter sat down on the stump of a tree and waited patiently for
  developments.</p>

  <p>There was a feeling of tension at Chesterford that night. The servants
  felt it. Pat had a sense of foreboding which she could not analyse or
  understand, and when Joyce asked if she might stay up in the kitchen with
  Higgins she pretended she did not know why the girt should prefer the company
  of that uninspiring man to the comfort of her own little room.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the Professor when the girl had gone, "she is still
  shaky over what happened last night&mdash;the man who walked through her
  room? By the way, was the door locked?"</p>

  <p>Pat nodded.</p>

  <p>"But the window open."</p>

  <p>"It was much too small for anybody to get out that way." said Hannay.</p>

  <p>Higgins came in at that moment. He looked a little perturbed.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir, have you another guest coming tonight?"</p>

  <p>Hannay shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Pat quickly.</p>

  <p>'There's a man been hanging around this house ever since dark," said
  Higgins. "I saw him slip back into the wood when he saw me."</p>

  <p>"When was this?" asked Hannay.</p>

  <p>"About five minutes ago. As a matter of fact I thought I saw him in the
  garden this morning, talking to you, miss."</p>

  <p>Pat felt her face go red, and was furious.</p>

  <p>"Somebody talking to you in the garden this morning?" said Hannay,
  frowning.</p>

  <p>Pat nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was the man I.... his name is Peter. I told you about him."</p>

  <p>She was a little incoherent.</p>

  <p>"But it's absurd, Higgins. He wouldn't be here tonight. Why should he
  be?"</p>

  <p>She made an excuse a little later and went to her room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay looked after her.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen Pat like that." he said slowly, but evidently the
  Professor was not interested in the unusual behaviour of Miss Patricia
  Hannay.</p>

  <p>After the door closed on her he sat for a long time, his finger-tips
  together, his eyes on the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I speak very plainly to you, my friend?" he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay was quite willing to accept any amount of plain speaking.</p>

  <p>"You told me"&mdash;Herzoff spoke slowly&mdash;"that you had an offer to
  rent this house. Why don't you take it and get away for a month or two?"</p>

  <p>Hannay bridled.</p>

  <p>"Because a few silly women&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Herzoff stopped him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Your man Higgins isn't a woman and he's not exactly silly. And I'm a
  scientist, Mr. Hannay, and I'm not stupid either. I have told you before
  that, whilst I'm willing to accept evidence or proof of spiritual phenomena,
  I am not by any means superstitious.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>The tick-tick-tick of the death watch was distinct, a slow, rhythmical
  tapping. Herzoff went to the wall and listened.</p>

  <p>"It's here." he said.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and listened again at the panelling there.</p>

  <p>"It's here also," he said.</p>

  <p>Then he turned and looked at the startled householder.</p>

  <p>"This is not a beetle, Mr. Hannay," he said slowly, and looked at the
  watch on his wrist, "It's just about now that one should hear it."</p>

  <p>Hannay swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked shakily.</p>

  <p>Herzoff come hack, pulled up a chair to the round table that was in the
  centre of the room and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember&mdash;or, if you don't remember, you've possibly
  heard&mdash;that there was a murder committed on the adjoining property?"</p>

  <p>Hannay nodded,</p>

  <p>"Since you spoke to me I have been making inquiries, and the general
  opinion seems to be that this wretched woman was not murdered where her body
  was found, but somewhere here, and to that murder I ascribe all these
  peculiar phenomena which you have witnessed or heard about."</p>

  <p>Hannay felt a cold chill creeping down his spine. Yet it was hot, so much
  so that it was necessary to wipe his forehead of the moisture which had
  suddenly come there.</p>

  <p>The Professor took a little package of papers from his pocket and opened
  them. They were typewritten.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you all the facts of the case," he began. "I took some trouble
  to collect them...."</p>

  <p>Upstairs in her room Pat had written her second letter. Her little desk
  was near the window, overlooking the garden. The desk itself was placed in a
  set of bookshelves that covered one side of the wall from the window to the
  door.</p>

  <p>She had blotted the address when the rattle of stones against her window
  made her jump. For a moment she was too terrified to act, then, drawing aside
  the curtains, she pushed open the window. Beneath her she saw a figure, not
  difficult to recognise.</p>

  <p>"How dare you do that!" she said unsteadily. "If you don't go away I'll
  call my father."</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," said Peter earnestly. "It's terribly important."</p>

  <p>She was less frightened now.</p>

  <p>"Go away." she commanded angrily, "or I'll 'phone the police."</p>

  <p>She did not see Peter smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll find the wires are disconnected. I've a little
  instrument here"&mdash;he took something from his pocket that looked like a
  watch&mdash;"and I've taken the trouble to make a few tests,"</p>

  <p>It was all Greek to her.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you. Will you come down?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then let me come up. I swear I won't hurt you or offend you in any
  way."</p>

  <p>"Don't he ridiculous."</p>

  <p>She thought for a moment, then:</p>

  <p>"Go to the front door and knock, and I'll come down and see you in the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Peter with the utmost politeness. "I never meet
  ladies in dining-rooms: it spoils the romance, Let me come up."</p>

  <p>Then she remembered.</p>

  <p>"Who told you the wires were cut?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say 'cut'. I said 'disconnected'. Let me come up, only for a
  second."</p>

  <p>Without waiting, for her permission he jumped up on to the window-sill
  below, caught a stout tendril of a vine that ran up by her window, and drew
  himself breast high, his elbow on the sill. She stepped back and stared at
  him. She had a wild inclination to push him from his insecure foothold, for
  she supposed that his feet were resting on something.</p>

  <p>"First of all, let me give you this."</p>

  <p>He lugged from his pocket a book. From where he was he could just reach
  the bookshelf. and, by bracing his feet in a fork of the vine, could give
  himself the necessary purchase. He thrust the book into a vacant place on the
  shelf.</p>

  <p>"Now listen. and don't interrupt." said Peter dictatorially. "I'm putting
  that book there because you may be in some danger. I want you to give me your
  word of honour that you won't touch It&mdash;until there is urgent need,"</p>

  <p>She was staggered by the request.</p>

  <p>"Is this your idea of a joke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's no joke," said Peter. "The title's a joke&mdash;it's called 'Advice
  to a Young Lady of Fashion'&mdash;God knows you want no advice! You must
  promise me you won't tell your father or anybody else that I gave it to
  you."</p>

  <p>She looked at the dingy cover. Even at the distance at which she stood she
  could decipher the faded red title. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>She reached out her hand for it, but he stopped her. "Word of honour?" he
  demanded sternly, and meekly she repeated the words.</p>

  <p>Peter listened.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know why I'm hanging round and why I forced my
  acquaintance on you this morning? Oh, yes. I did it deliberately. I could
  easily have avoided you. I was going to slow the car, when I saw it was
  you."</p>

  <p>"Why are you here?" asked Pat, and Peter Dunn's face became suddenly
  stern.</p>

  <p>"I'm here to clear the reputation of the best man that ever lived." he
  said, and in another second he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Site looked down. but he was not in sight. and she stood, puzzled and
  bewildered, until she heard a sound that nude her blood turn to ice.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE PROFESSOR was nearing the end of his narrative. "They
  were tramps to the world, but they had known one another many years before,
  in happier circumstances." He had a majestic delivery; gave to the most
  commonplace story the dignity of history.</p>

  <p>"Both had deteriorated through the years. and he was a brute. more like a
  beast than a man. Then one day, when they had touched the lowest depths, they
  met in this neighbourhood. The murder was committed&mdash;his voice was slow
  and impressive&mdash;"in that wooden hut on the edge of your grounds. A
  witness heard the sobbing of the woman. saw the door of the hut open slowly,
  and the murderer come out."</p>

  <p>He stopped for a moment.</p>

  <p>"And that is what has been seen since."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay shivered.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it." he began.</p>

  <p>"That is my theory." said the Professor. "She was in the hut when he found
  her. The sound you hear is not the tapping of an insect, it is the tapping on
  the door of the hut when the murderer sought admission."</p>

  <p>His eyes suddenly travelled to the door of the library. "Look!" he said
  huskily.</p>

  <p>The door was ajar, opening slowly, without any human agency.</p>

  <p>Hannay started to his feet; his legs gave way under him, but with an
  effort he braced himself and ran to the open door. There was nobody
  there.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>From the dark passage came the sound of a woman sobbing, and then a
  bestial scream that sent him reeling back.</p>

  <p>Pat heard it and came flying down the stairs. She saw her father standing
  at the open door of the library, transfixed, his face pale, his mouth open
  ludicrously. "What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything?" demanded Hannay shakily. "'This is the finish,
  Pat.... we'll get out of this house tomorrow."</p>

  <p>The Professor nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"That is the wisest decision you have ever made, Mr. Hannay." he said.</p>

  <p>Morning brought a blue sky and a flood of sunlight, and Mr. Hannay
  weakened on his resolution. He came into Pat's little sitting-room to talk
  the matter over with her.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I'm so keen to leave this place," he said. "In fact,
  darling, I feel I'm&mdash;um&mdash;running away from&mdash;not exactly
  danger, but the threat of danger. And we Hannays&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For some reason Pat did not feel annoyed with him. She had some sense of
  protection which she could not define or explain.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay, wandering about the room. his hands in. his pockets. suddenly
  saw a new title on the bookshelf, "What's this?"</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand. Pat hastily intervened. " 'Advice to a Young
  Lady of Fashion'. That's an old thing, isn't it? Who is the author?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know who the author is," said Pat rapidly. "only I don't want you
  to touch it. It belongs to a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"It isn't one of those neurotic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid, darling. It belongs to a friend of mine. and that is
  sufficient."</p>

  <p>She asked herself, after he had left, why she had made such a scene, and
  exactly how important the wishes of the man called Peter were to her.</p>

  <p>The Professor came down to breakfast with them, but heard of Mr. Hannay's
  decision for the first time that afternoon. Pat found him walking about the
  grounds on her return from Maidenhead. where she had driven Mr. Hannay, who
  banked in that town.</p>

  <p>"Are you admiring my car or our garage?" asked Pat.</p>

  <p>Herzoff turned quickly and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were back. Well, has your father let the house?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she said quietly. "I have persuaded him to stay on."</p>

  <p>He was taken aback by this.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the story of this place",</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Daddy told me on our way into Maidenhead."</p>

  <p>"And you still wish to stay?"</p>

  <p>"I still wish to stay," she said.</p>

  <p>She felt a sudden antagonism towards this man, an antagonism which was
  unreasonable and unfounded.</p>

  <p>Herzoff chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You're a very brave girl." he said. "I admire you for it, but I hope you
  will persuade your father to get out. You may laugh at me for a foolish,
  middle-aged man with illusions, but I am psychometric, and I have a feeling
  that this house at the moment is a place of doom for all of you."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly the kind of house I like to live in," said Pat, with
  sudden recklessness.</p>

  <p>On her way back to the house she passed the gardener. He straightened his
  back as she came near him, and to her indignation and amazement hailed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, young lady! Having a chat with the professor? He's a swell fellow!
  But he's not much better than me."</p>

  <p>Then, to her horror, he put out his big paw and caught her under the chin,
  lifting up her head, She was paralysed with fury. Then she struck at the big
  hand and went running towards the house.</p>

  <p>Herzoff had been a witness of the scene. He came slowly across the garden.
  He was paring his nails with a small penknife, apparently intent upon his
  occupation, and he did not lift his eyes until he came face to face with the
  gardener.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that," he said gently.</p>

  <p>"Do what?" growled the big man.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch that young lady."</p>

  <p>Twice Herzoff's hand came up and down, and the gardener's cheeks went
  suddenly red and wet. The man uttered a roar and put up his hand to his
  slashed face.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that."</p>

  <p>There was a whimper in his face that was absurd in so big a man.</p>

  <p>"There was no cause for that."</p>

  <p>"Don't interfere with that young lady. Go and wash your face, Mr. Higgins
  will give you a little sticking plaster."</p>

  <p>Pat came breathlessly into the kitchen. Mr. Higgins was putting glasses on
  a tray, and looked round at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Higgins," said Pat breathlessly, "who is this new gardener?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about him, miss, but I'm told he's a very respectable
  chap&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well. discharge him at once." she said.</p>

  <p>"Why, miss, I'm sorry to hear you say that. He's not very presentable, but
  faces don't mean anything&mdash;that's my experience."</p>

  <p>"It's dreadful that we've got to have men like that about the house," said
  Pat, as she made for the door of the dining-room.</p>

  <p>Higgins shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Well, miss, you can't get people to stay in a house that's supernatural.
  Personally I don't mind, though it gets me worried at times."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Pat remembered something.</p>

  <p>"Where has he been sleeping&mdash;this gardener?" Higgins hesitated.</p>

  <p>"In the cellar, miss, but he won't sleep there now because of the
  noises."</p>

  <p>"Have you the key?"</p>

  <p>She put out her hand for it, and Higgins took it from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go down there if I were you, miss."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go down," she said sharply, "I want to lock the door so
  that nobody else can go down,"</p>

  <p>She tried the door: it was already fastened, and she slipped the key into
  her bag.</p>

  <p>"That man doesn't sleep in this house tonight&mdash; understand that," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Very good, miss." said Higgins, a little hurt.</p>

  <p>She saw Herzoff as she passed through the breakfast room.</p>

  <p>"That man will not annoy you again, Miss Pat."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he will," said Pat. "I've told Higgins to get rid of
  him."</p>

  <p>His lips pursed.</p>

  <p>"I assure you he's been punished enough&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"And I assure you, Professor Herzoff, that he will leave Chesterford
  today," said Pat.</p>

  <p>There had been another witness of the incident in the garden. Peter Dunn
  had found a new point of vantage: a branch of a tree that overhung the little
  private road which was Mr. Hannay's very own. So situated, he could not get
  down to deal with the loutish gardener, but he had watched with some
  satisfaction and astonishment Professor Herzoff's summary administration of
  justice. He saw the girl and Herzoff go into the house, and waited. All that
  morning he had been hoping to meet her, and had his car conveniently parked
  so that he might follow and overtake her if she came out. And now, when his
  own machine was a quarter of a mile away, it looked as if he was to be
  baffled, for he saw her cross the lawn towards the garage, drawing on her
  gloves. There was no time for him to get his car.</p>

  <p>Presently she came out, swept round the narrow drive near the garage into
  the road over which he was sitting. She was going slowly, which in a measure
  was an act of providence, for when he called her by name in a loud whisper
  she stopped the car and looked round, and, happily, stopped it right under
  the bough where he was sitting. She heard the thud as he struck the seat
  beside her, and looked round in amazement,</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>" 'Baby dear', you ought to say." said Peter. "And my answer is. 'Out of
  the everywhere into here'."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Going for a ride," said Peter. "In America all the best gangsters take
  their friends for a ride."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a gangster and you're not my friend."</p>

  <p>"Don't argue." said Peter Dunn. "Your father will come alone in a minute
  sad he'll ask me my intentions. Think how embarrassing that will be."</p>

  <p>Site sent the car along with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"You're a rotten had driver. but you'll improve with practice."</p>

  <p>"Why are those glasses round your neck?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He wore a pair of field glasses suspended by a strap.</p>

  <p>"The better to see you with, my dear." And, when she shot an indignant
  glance at him: "A quotation from Red Riding Hood," he said gently. "Those
  glasses are for spying purpose. I've been spying on you."</p>

  <p>She reached the secondary road and stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"I've dropped my handkerchief. Will you get out?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head with great calmness.</p>

  <p>"That's a dirty trick to get me out."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you here." she said.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know that. If you did the whole thing would be simple. I should go to
  the registrar and get a licence."</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>"Have you any sense of decency?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; that is why I should get a licence first."</p>

  <p>Again she stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"Get out," she said firmly, and this time she meant it.</p>

  <p>Peter obeyed. She did not drive on.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you one question. Will you tell me what is your name and
  why you are here. Probably there is some special reason why it should be kept
  secret, and if there is I promise you I will tell nobody."</p>

  <p>"My name is Peter Dunn." he said, after a moment's consideration. "Until
  yesterday I was a sergeant in the Criminal Investigation Department of
  Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>He saw her mouth and eyes open.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you any more?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm an inspector. I was promoted this morning. They telephoned
  me&mdash;that is why my manner errs on the side of frivolity."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come here? What is there for a Scotland Yard officer....?"</p>

  <p>"A lot of things. But I'll tell you the main thing that is keeping me
  hanging around here and making me keep this case all to myself. I have a
  personal interest in it&mdash;two personal interests: one, the reputation of
  a dear friend of mine who is dead."</p>

  <p>"And the other?" she asked, when he stopped.</p>

  <p>"The other is you." he said simply. "I'm terribly sorry, but I've fallen
  in love with you."</p>

  <p>His eyes looked at her straightly. He was telling the truth. She went red
  and white. and then:</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling the truth or a lie?" he demanded, the old smile in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm telling a lie," she said, and sent the car forward in six distinct
  unworkmanlike jumps.</p>

  <p>Peter was walking back the way he had come when he heard the horn of a car
  behind him, but did not turn round till she came abreast of him.</p>

  <p>"I'll drive you back," she said.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Peter simply. "I'd rather walk."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with disapproval.</p>

  <p>"It's a very long way&mdash;" she began,</p>

  <p>"You don't know where I'm going, so you can't say it's a long way or a
  short way."</p>

  <p>"I don't like your manners."</p>

  <p>"I've taken prizes for them," said Peter. "For the matter of that, I don't
  like your car. You've humiliated me."</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Humiliated you? How?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you I love you, and you haven't had the decency to fall out of
  the car into my arms."</p>

  <p>She brought the car to a shuddering stop.</p>

  <p>"Come here." she said. You can kiss me&mdash;once."</p>

  <p>He kissed her once, but it was a long once....</p>

  <p>Pat Hannay came back to the house. There was a look in her eyes that a
  wise woman could have interpreted. But there was nobody in Chesterford wiser
  than Joyce, the maid, and she at the moment was preoccupied.</p>

  <p>Pat went up to her room, closed the door, took off her coat and looked in
  the glass. There were some things which could not be believed. Some such
  thing had happened that day, and she could only look at herself in wonder.
  She found a difficulty in breathing normally, and the hands that tidied her
  hair were shaking,</p>

  <p>She looked out of the window, hoping that by some miracle he would be in
  sight....</p>

  <p>There was his book, She reached out to take it, but remembered her promise
  and drew back.</p>

  <p>A detective officer.... a policeman.... how would Mr. Hannay, somebody
  very important "in the drapery", accept that devastating fact?</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay had ideas for her; looked as high as the House of Lords: had
  confided to her his desire to found a lordly line with such assistance as she
  could offer.</p>

  <p>A policeman.... that puzzled her. She went down to the library to find
  some sort of reference book, having a vague idea that she could discover the
  briefest biography of the man who had kissed her once. For the time being
  Chesterford and its horrible secret receded into the background.</p>

  <p>The miracle did not happen; there was no hook more communicative than an
  annual almanac which gave her the names and divisions of some thirteen or
  fourteen superintendents, but omitted any mention of Inspector Peter Dunn,
  who yesterday was sergeant.</p>

  <p>Between then and dinner-time site wrote him a dozen letters, all very
  carefully considered, all finishing on the first or second page. One was too
  dignified, another too friendly. She ran the gamut of emotions, doubts and
  hopes appropriate to the occasion. Happily, she had secured temporary help in
  the shape of a cook who had come on the condition that she left the house
  before nightfall.</p>

  <p>Chesterford was beginning to gain unenviable notoriety, and Pat had almost
  fallen on the stout lady's neck.</p>

  <p>She had seen no more of the gardener, and, when she questioned Higgins, he
  told her that the man had been paid off and had gone, and she was a little
  relieved.</p>

  <p>When her delirium had a little subsided, and she came to take stock of her
  room&mdash;it was when she began to dress&mdash;she became aware that
  somebody had made a very careful search of the apartment. The bureau drawer
  where she kept her handkerchiefs was a muddle and a confusion when she opened
  it. The drawers of her desk had also been disturbed. Suddenly she remembered
  the key of the cellar, which she had put away in a pigeon-hole behind a small
  table clock. The clock was there, but it had been moved. The pigeon-hole was
  empty.</p>

  <p>She finished dressing and went down to dinner, but made no reference to
  the matter until they were in the drawing-room and coffee had been
  served.</p>

  <p>"Have you been to my room, daddy?" she asked. "Somebody has been there,
  pulled out the drawers, opened my bureau and searched my desk."</p>

  <p>Herzoff looked up quickly from his coffee.</p>

  <p>"Have you missed anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The key of the cellar," said Pat. "I took it from Higgins this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>Hannay had suddenly an idea.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it was that fellow&mdash;the man who is always wandering
  about this place&mdash;that young person. What did you call him&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Peter?" said Pat incredulously. "Don't be stupid, daddy, Why should
  he&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Herzoff interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Peter! What is his other name, do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Peter Dunn," she said, and she saw the Professor's mouth open and close
  and his lips draw in.</p>

  <p>"Peter Dunn!" he repeated. "That's interesting. You know him, do you, Miss
  Hannay&mdash;a Scotland Yard man?"</p>

  <p>"Hey?" Hannay was suddenly alert. "A Scotland Yard officer? What the
  dickens is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>Pat rose to the moment heroically.</p>

  <p>"He is my fiancé," she said, and the two men were dumb-stricken.</p>

  <p>"Fiancé?" Mr. Hannay squeaked the word. "A policeman? Are you mad,
  Patricia?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not mad." said Patricia. "I'm just telling you as a fact. He has
  asked me to marry him and I'm going to."</p>

  <p>She did not wait to see the effect of her pronouncement, but went up to
  her room. She had an uncanny feeling that Peter Dunn was near. Before she
  pulled the curtains and opened the window she extinguished the light. Her
  heart leapt as she distinguished a figure standing on the edge of the grass
  beneath her window.</p>

  <p>"Is that you?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"That's me," said Peter Dunn. "I heard you!"</p>

  <p>Her heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Heard what?"</p>

  <p>"I heard you telling your parents that I'd asked you to marry me, which
  wasn't true. I haven't asked you to marry me. I merely made love to you."</p>

  <p>"That amounts to the same thing in civilised communities," she said
  coldly.</p>

  <p>She ought to have been furious with him, she told herself, but she did not
  feel furious. She had fallen instinctively into Peter's peculiar habit of
  thought and speech.</p>

  <p>''I'm going to marry you, anyway," said Peter. "I decided that a long time
  ago."</p>

  <p>She spoke to him again, but had no answer. When she looked out he had
  gone. She thought she saw him in the shadow of a bush which grew against the
  house. Then she heard the crunch of heavy feet crossing the gravelled path.
  She could not see who it was, but he came nearer, and then her heart jumped.
  It was the gardener, the man Higgins said had gone, and he was coming
  directly towards her window.</p>

  <p>She drew aside, peering round the edge of the window sash, and saw him
  halt on the lawn about half a dozen yards away. He was smoking a cigar; she
  saw the red glow of it as he took it out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Are you up there. miss?" he asked in a croaking whisper.</p>

  <p>She did not answer. Evidently he had heard her voice and had come across
  to investigate. What was he doing there? If Higgins had spoken the truth be
  had no right to be in the grounds of Chesterford. Perhaps he had come back
  for something he had left behind. She found a dozen uneasy explanations, and
  was relieved when he turned and walked back the way he had come, presently to
  be swallowed in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Your voice carries too far, young lady." It was Peter's sibilant whisper.
  "That was a narrow squeak,"</p>

  <p>"For me or you?"</p>

  <p>"For me&mdash;therefore for you." said Peter. "Two guns, eh?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"One on each hip&mdash;I saw them. Now go in, shut the window and draw the
  blinds. and don't put on your light."</p>

  <p>She sat in the darkness for a long time. Then she heard a sound that
  brought her heart to her mouth. A ladder was being put against her window.
  She sat and quaked. She had fastened the casement. She dared not look. and
  only a shadow, which almost seemed imaginary, showed on the curtain. Then she
  heard a soft, thudding sound, as though somebody was hitting a piece of iron
  with a hammer which had been carefully muffled.</p>

  <p>Her first thought was to fly downstairs, but terror held her, and in her
  terror was that curiosity which is natural in a healthy girl.</p>

  <p>After ten minutes the hammering stopped. She heard the rasp of feet on the
  rungs of the ladder, and the scrape of it as it was taken away. She went
  carefully to the window, drew the curtain aside a fraction of an inch and
  looked out. She could just see the man.... it was the gardener!</p>

  <p>Then she saw what he had been doing. Across her window stretched, in the
  shape of a St. Andrew's cross, two steel rods. They had this effect, that
  they made it impossible for the window to open.</p>

  <p>Peter had seen the manoeuvre, watching at a respectful distance. He waited
  till Standey had carried the ladder back to a big greenhouse, then he crept
  forward and saw the work he had been doing.</p>

  <p>Something pretty bad was going to happen tonight. He wondered just what it
  would be.</p>

  <p>He had a lot of work to do, and he had already lost a considerable amount
  of time. He got back to the hut in the wood, fitted a jemmy together and
  wrenched off the staple which held the door.</p>

  <p>He was not unprepared for what he saw: a yawning hole in the middle of the
  hut, roughly supported by tree trunks that must have been cut for the
  purpose. A homemade ladder led to the depths. He went down quickly. reached
  the bottom, and saw the black mouth of a tunnel.</p>

  <p>The floor was of rock and ascended: but the going was dangerous. At the
  very stir of his feet great lumps of earth fell from the roof, and he was
  glad to get back to the ladder and the outer air.</p>

  <p>He reached the little lane and went on foot for a hundred yards. Near
  where he had parked his car four men were waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Peter, have you found anything?"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of his chief inspector, and with him were another
  Scotland Yard man and two heads of the Berkshire police.</p>

  <p>"The whole gang is here," reported Peter. "Lee Smitt, Red Fanderson and
  Joe Kelly. Smitt is posing as a professor with a knowledge of the occult. The
  curious thing is that he's been a member of this golf club for about twenty
  years. He has probably visited the country before, and I shouldn't he
  surprised to find that he's a member of some of the most exclusive clubs in
  town. Fanderson's been working as a gardener&mdash;I believe he did some
  gardening when he was in Dartmoor&mdash;and Joe Kelly is back at his old
  job&mdash;butler-valet, with the grand old name of Higgins."</p>

  <p>"We can pinch 'em," said his chief thoughtfully. "and charge 'em with
  returning to the country after being deported&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not here to pinch 'em for being deported." said Peter almost
  savagely. "I'm here to wipe out the lie that put Sam Allerway into a
  suicide's grave. That's highly dramatic, but it's highly sincere. If you
  pinched them now you wouldn't get the stuff. Eight hundred and thirty
  thousand Canadian dollars, all lying snug."</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked one of the Berkshire chiefs.</p>

  <p>"In Hannay's house."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how it can be in Hannay's house," said one of the men. "Why
  should they have put it there?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why later."</p>

  <p>"How did you stumble on this, Peter? When you 'phoned me yesterday I
  thought you'd gone crazy."</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn told the story of the night when the little cruiser was tied up
  to Hannay's land.</p>

  <p>"It was just a ghost story told by an hysterical maid," be said, "until
  the butler came down to return the rug. The moment I heard his voice I knew
  it was Kelly. I'd heard it in court&mdash;there was no mistaking it. I
  identified the gardener and Lee Swill the next day. They've got nerve, but
  they're desperate. There are eight hundred and thirty thousand Canadian
  dollars, and that's a lot of dollars."</p>

  <p>"Why should it be in Hannay's house?" The question was asked again.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about that one of these days." said Peter. "I'm going
  back now. Whatever is going to happen will happen tonight. I want the house
  closed on all sides, including the river."</p>

  <p>"The Bucks police are sending a motor-boat patrol," said one of the
  Berkshire men. "I've got fifty plain-clothes officers within half a mile.
  When do you think you'll want us. and how are we to know?"</p>

  <p>Peter Dunn explained his plan of operations: but, like many other
  carefully made plans, it was doomed to failure. Happily he did not know this
  as he went back quickly towards Chesterford and its strange guests.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Pat went back to the drawing-room she saw Herzoff shoot
  a quick, penetrating glance in her direction, then his eyes dropped. She
  realised he had seen that something had happened. She caught a glimpse of her
  face in a mirror: it was alight with excitement.</p>

  <p>There was danger, here: she knew it. And Peter Dunn was at hand. That gave
  the danger a beautiful relish. Her father was reading. Mr. Herzoff was
  working out a patience puzzle. Suddenly Hannay put down his book. I think
  I'll get another dog," he said. "I don't like the idea of
  your&mdash;"&mdash;he made a wry face&mdash;"fiancé&mdash;that was a joke in
  the worst possible taste, Pat&mdash;wandering about Chesterford. It doesn't
  amuse me at all."</p>

  <p>"What are you reading. daddy?"</p>

  <p>"One of the Famous Trials series. I must say it doesn't seem an
  appropriate book to be reading in the circumstances."</p>

  <p>Herzoff looked up calmly.</p>

  <p>"What is it called?"</p>

  <p>He knew well enough what the title was; he had seen it. "It's the trial of
  those three fellows who robbed the Canadian Bank of Commerce about ten years
  ago," said Mr. Hannay. "I suppose they got away with the money."</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten what it was all about."</p>

  <p>Herzoff went on dealing out the cards calmly and systematically.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" Mr. Hannay was struck with the brilliance of the thought.
  "There's a big haul for somebody. They got twelve years. I suppose they're
  out by now."</p>

  <p>"They were deported," said Pat. "I read it in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>Pat suddenly lifted her head.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>It was the sound of moaning, and it came from the window. Pat set her
  teeth, went across and pulled hack the curtains with a jerk. She almost
  swooned. Framed in the window was the face of a woman, hideous, white,
  streaked with wet red. Her untidy grey hair was falling over her
  forehead.</p>

  <p>With a scream the girl snatched the curtain back again and ran blindly
  back to her father. He had seen it, too.</p>

  <p>"The tramp woman," said Herzoff in a low tone. "That is a manifestation I
  did not expect to see."</p>

  <p>He spun round. From somewhere outside came the sound of a struggle. There
  was a crash against the door that led on to the veranda, and then a single
  pistol shot rang out.</p>

  <p>It was Hannay who opened the door, and Peter Dunn staggered in. There was
  a streak of blood on his forehead; in his hand was an automatic. He closed
  the door quickly, turned the key, and for a second stood with his back to the
  door, eyeing two people who were amazed to see him and one who had murder in
  his heart.</p>

  <p>Peter staggered across to the table and lifted the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Dead, eh? Telephones don't have ghosts, Mr. Herzoff, do they?"</p>

  <p>Herzoff did not reply.</p>

  <p>Pat was by his side.</p>

  <p>"You're hurt!" she mid tremulously.</p>

  <p>"Take my handkerchief&mdash;it's in my pocket," said Peter. "It's all
  right, it might have been worse."</p>

  <p>"I'll get some water for you."</p>

  <p>It was Herzoff who made this gesture.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but don't trouble to get a priest; I'm not dead yet, Herzoff."</p>

  <p>He watched the man leave the room, then he lugged out of his pocket a
  clumsy-looking pistol.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind taking this out on to your lawn and</p>

  <p>shooting it in the air? It's nothing more deadly than a Verey light, and I
  think you can go with safety."</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Have you lost the key of your cellar?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. She was not even surprised that he asked the question. By now
  Peter Dunn was the embodiment of all knowledge and understanding.</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be the case. Will you get me some water?"</p>

  <p>She ran into the dining-room and came back with a glassful.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, darling."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay winced.</p>

  <p>Peter drank the glassful at a gulp, and then, taking the girl's face in
  his hands, he kissed her. Mr. Hannay was petrified.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean by that?" he stormed.</p>

  <p>"He meant to kiss me by that," said Pat quietly,</p>

  <p>"Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Delightful," said a voice from the doorway.</p>

  <p>It was Herzoff.</p>

  <p>"You can lie down in my room if you wish, Mr. Dunn," he said.</p>

  <p>He walked towards him leisurely, his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you left an unpleasant stain on that door."</p>

  <p>Peter turned his head. He did not feel the life preserver that hit
  him.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, and don't scream. either of you!" snarled Herzoff. "And put
  that Verey down, Hannay."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;" began Mr. Hannay.</p>

  <p>"And don't ask questions. Come in, you boys."</p>

  <p>The big gardener and the butler came in.</p>

  <p>"Take him up to my room and tie him up. As for you, young lady, you can go
  to your room for the moment.</p>

  <p>When I want you I'll come for you. If you scream or try to attract
  attention, you'll wish you hadn't."</p>

  <p>She walked past him, almost overtook the men as they turned into Herzoff's
  room, and presently reached her own. She slammed the door and locked it. She
  was dazed. Such things could not happen in England, she told herself again
  and again. She was having a bad dream, and presently would wake up.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay had submitted to being bound to a chair. To him the world's end
  had come. Here he was, in his own drawing-room. being scientifically tied by
  a man whom he had regarded as.... It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"If I'd known who you were&mdash;" he said huskily.</p>

  <p>Herzoff smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's rather a foolish remark. After all. I've laid your ghosts: you owe
  me something for that. If you'd accepted the handsome offer I made to you
  when I wanted to rent the house, you would not have been troubled.
  Unfortunately, you very stupidly ignored that offer, and I had to frighten
  you&mdash;and you hadn't sufficient sense to be frightened."</p>

  <p>He left his host and went up the stairs two at a time to his own room.
  Peter was lying on the bed. fastened hand and foot. He looked at him for a
  moment, then went on to Pat's room.</p>

  <p>"Patricia!" he wiled softly. "It's Mr. Herzoff speaking." She did not
  answer. He knew she had heard.</p>

  <p>"I am the only person who can get you out of this house alive," he said.
  "Take a chance with me, and I'll keep the others off."</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner die!"</p>

  <p>He heard and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sooner have my gorilla, would you? Well, maybe you can have him. I don't
  know why Red has taken such a fancy to you, but women have been his weakness
  all his life.... I'm giving you a chance&mdash;do a little forgetting and
  come with me."</p>

  <p>Again he waited for a reply, but none came.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose anybody's getting out of this house to tell the police
  who we are, do you? A great chance they've got! I'm 'phoning to a London
  newspaper tonight, telling them that you and your father have left for the
  Continent. Think that over&mdash;it means something.... it means that you
  will not be found for a long time after I've left England."</p>

  <p>When he got back to his own room he interrupted a flow of invective from
  the gardener.</p>

  <p>"That fellow took a shot at me!" growled Red Fanderson."</p>

  <p>"If you'd been doing your job you wouldn't have been there." said Herzoff,
  and pulled up a chair to the side of the bed. "Well. Mr. Peter Dunn?"</p>

  <p>"You'll go back for life for this," said Peter between his teeth.</p>

  <p>Herzoff was amused.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you keep out of it? You've not been detailed: you took the job
  on as a holiday task, I understand. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I want the money you stole from the Canadian Bank of Commerce. and a
  portion of which you made the judge believe Sam Allerway had taken. The
  money's in this house, under Hannay's cellar. You cached it here by accident.
  The other house belongs to you, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>He saw the man's expression change and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Got it first time! You bought the other house before you committed the
  robbery. I was checking up the dates. The night you got away from London in
  that secondhand car, you intended coming here to hide it in the cellar of the
  house you'd bought: but in the dark you went to the wrong house. They both
  looked alike in the days before Hannay started building&mdash;and one of you
  picked the wrong house, got into it and buried your stuff under the cellar,
  and when you came out of quad you couldn't get it. You tried to build a
  tunnel from the gardener's hut, but the bedrock was too near the
  surface."</p>

  <p>"We built the tunnel all right." growled Lee Smitt, and he was speaking
  the truth.</p>

  <p>Peter was momentarily surprised.</p>

  <p>He saw somebody standing in the doorway, watching him. He lifted his eyes
  and smiled at the hideous woman whose appearance at the window had so badly
  frightened Pat. Before she pulled off her tousled wig and began wiping the
  make-up from her face he recognised the pretty Joyce.</p>

  <p>"You might introduce me to your daughter, Smitt. She hasn't been through
  my hands&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>But Lee Smitt had other matters to consider.</p>

  <p>"We've got to work hard tonight. Red," he said. "and get that stuff out.
  There's only another yard to dig."</p>

  <p>"And hard you'll have to work!" mocked Peter.</p>

  <p>Lee Smitt was looking at him with an odd expression. Presently he reached
  out and tapped the big "gardener" on the shoulder,</p>

  <p>"Get that girl, Red. She's yours!"</p>

  <p>Peter's face went white and drawn.</p>

  <p>"If you hurt her...."</p>

  <p>"If I hurt her or don't hurt her you'll be quite unconscious of the fact
  by tomorrow," mid Lee Smitt curtly. "Help get him down to the cellar.
  There'll be a big hole there when those boxes come out, Mr. Dunn, and we'll
  want three people to put in it. That's all&mdash;three."</p>

  <p>Pat heard their heavy feet as they carried Peter along the passage. And
  then she heard another sound&mdash;somebody was trying the handle of her
  door.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Open the door, little darling."</p>

  <p>It was the voice of the big gardener, and for a moment she swayed and had
  to hold on to the wall for support.</p>

  <p>"You can't come in here. The door's locked. If you don't go away I'll
  scream."</p>

  <p>"Sure you'll scream." The answer had seemed to amuse him. "You'll scream
  more in a minute. Open that door...."</p>

  <p>The door shook as he threw his weight against it, She was terrified. She
  ran to the window, and then understood the significance of those two cross
  bars which prevented the window being opened.</p>

  <p>A panel splintered under the fist of the big man, and she looked round in
  frantic despair.... Her eyes fell upon the book, "Advice to a Young Lady of
  Fashion." It was a straw, and she clutched at it. She pulled the book out
  from the shelf. It was unusually heavy, and when she opened it she saw the
  reason: embedded in the very centre of the pages which had been cut out to
  receive it, was a small automatic pistol. With trembling hands she took it
  out, and dropped the book on the floor as the door ripped open.</p>

  <p>He was standing there, his face inflamed, his pale eyes like two balls of
  white fire.</p>

  <p>"If you come near me I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>"Shoot, eh?"</p>

  <p>He took one step into the room. The crash of the explosion deafened her.
  With horror she saw the man crumple up and go down with a crash to the floor,
  and she ran past him, still gripping the gun in her hand. The wonder was that
  in her excitement her convulsive clutch did not explode another shot.</p>

  <p>She turned on the lights of the drawing-room as she went in. Her father
  was sitting. trussed up in a chair. She tried to untie his bonds but could
  not. Then, on the floor, near the garden door, she saw the clumsy-looking
  pistol. She turned the key of the lock and ran outside. Aiming the pistol
  high in the air, she fired. It was an odd experience.</p>

  <p>She was in the home again before the Verey light illuminated the
  countryside.</p>

  <p>Where had they taken Peter? The library was empty. She passed into the
  kitchen and heard sounds. The cellar door was open and she looked in. Then
  she heard the voices more clearly. It was Peter who was speaking.</p>

  <p>"If you hurt that girl you'd better kill me."</p>

  <p>"You'll be killed all right." said Herzoff. "Snap into it, Joe: we've got
  to be away from here by daylight. Joyce, you take the girl's car and
  clear&mdash;don't wait for us." Pat walked on to the landing and took one
  step down, "You'll ask me first, won't you?"</p>

  <p>At the sound of her voice they looked up.</p>

  <p>"Don't move or I'll shoot. Untie Mr. Dunn."</p>

  <p>The quick-witted Joyce came sidling towards her. "You wouldn't shoot a
  woman, would you, Miss Hannay?" she whined.</p>

  <p>"If I had to shoot any woman I should shoot you," said Pat, and she so
  obviously meant it that the girl stepped back in a fright. "Untie Mr.
  Dunn."</p>

  <p>She waited till Peter was on his feet, and her attention was so
  concentrated upon him that she did not sec Herzoff's hand moving up the wall.
  If she had, she might not have realised that it was going towards the
  electric switch.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk this over, Miss Hannay." The mysterious professor drawled his
  words. "Give us half an hour to get away and nobody will he hurt. This
  stuff"&mdash;he pointed to an open door which evidently led to an inner
  cellar&mdash;"is ours. We've done twelve years for it, and we're entitled to
  have it."</p>

  <p>And then the light went out. She heard a shot, and another, and the sound
  of a woman's shriek.</p>

  <p>She flew up the stairs into the dark kitchen, and stumbled through into
  the open air. Somebody was at her heels. It was the butler. He grabbed at
  her, and caught her by the sleeve. She tore her way out of his grasp and
  ran.</p>

  <p>Somewhere near at hand police whistles were blowing. She had a dim
  consciousness of seeing men running across the lawn towards her.</p>

  <p>"Where's Inspector Dunn?"</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the authoritative tone. She gasped her news.</p>

  <p>Her pursuer had disappeared, They found him, when the lights came on, in
  the kitchen, a philosophical criminal awaiting the inevitable arrest.</p>

  <p>As she came into the kitchen Peter staggered out of the cellar
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"Have they got Smitt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him. You mean Professor Herzoff?" Peter turned to an
  officer who had come in.</p>

  <p>"Call an ambulance. He shot his daughter. If be didn't come up here he's
  down there still."</p>

  <p>He looked at the butler.</p>

  <p>"Is there another way out of here?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say there is&mdash;through the tunnel, I guess," said Higgins
  sulkily.</p>

  <p>"The tunnel?"</p>

  <p>Peter remembered the man's boast.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it's pretty dangerous to use. The ground was too soft; it kept
  running down on us."</p>

  <p>Peter turned quickly back to the cellar, reached the bottom of the stone
  steps and passed through the door which separated the inner cellar. Then he
  saw for the first time the low entrance of the tunnel. Somebody was
  there.</p>

  <p>"Come out, Smitt."</p>

  <p>The answer was a shot that sent the earth scattering. It had another
  effect. Great lumps of soft earth began to pour through, Peter had just time
  to scramble hack to the cellar when there was a rumble and a roar, and great
  clouds of dust shot out of the narrow entrance. He threw in the rays of his
  lamp, but could sec nothing.</p>

  <p>"That's the weakest part of the tunnel." It was Higgins' quavering voice
  "I told Lee we mustn't use it...." Suddenly he stopped, and a look of terror
  came to his face.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he whispered, -and. listening, they heard the click-click-click
  of the death watch. "That's for Lee."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing much more to explain," said Peter Dunn that night when he
  had told his story ostensibly to Mr. Hannay, actually to Mr. Hannay's
  daughter. "The. first thing they did was to frighten away all the servants
  and substitute their own crowd. That was at the back of all the ghost
  business.</p>

  <p>"They thought it would be easy. They had already made an abortive attempt
  to reach the cellar through a tunnel which they drove under the earth. It
  must have taken two months of hard work, and they used the time while you
  were in the South of France. They got into the house, but they didn't relish
  taking on the caretaker you left there, a policeman from the neighbourhood,
  if I remember rightly.</p>

  <p>"Once they'd staffed the house with their own people, their job was to get
  rid of you and Pat. They did the honourable thing&mdash;they offered to rent
  your house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannay snorted.</p>

  <p>"When that failed," Peter went on, "they used the method by which they had
  terrorised the servants to get you to give up your occupation. If you'd done
  that it would have been a simple matter: they could have opened up their
  treasure house at leisure. As it was, they could only work for a few hours at
  night, and they had to cart the earth away in sacks. You'll find two or three
  full sacks near your gardener's shed.</p>

  <p>"What puzzled me was the maid, Joyce. I didn't know until this afternoon
  that Lee Smitt had a daughter who had been an actress. When she pretended
  that she'd seen a man walk through her room she acted pretty well. Anyway,
  she deceived you. Mr. Hannay, and I should imagine that you would take a
  whole lot of deceiving."</p>

  <p>Pat tried to catch his eye but did not succeed.</p>

  <p>"It is very remarkable how things come about," said Mr. Hannay, "Something
  told me that in no circumstances ought I to give up possession of this
  house&mdash;which shows you, Mr. Dunn, how the path of duty can also
  be&mdash;um&mdash;the path of glory. If I had taken the easier path we should
  not have captured these criminals. We might have saved ourselves a little
  trouble. and perhaps a little danger&mdash;and I don't think any of you
  realise how near I was to choking myself with that beastly gag the fellow put
  into my mouth&mdash;but we should not have and the satisfaction of having
  placed two miscreants in gaol. By the way, I suppose my evidence will be
  necessary?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly." said Peter, with great gravity, "Your evidence will
  possibly be the most vital of all."</p>

  <p>When her father had gone, Pat asked:</p>

  <p>"Am I to go into that awful court?"</p>

  <p>"You are not," said Peter Dunn emphatically. "There are quite enough
  people taking credit for this little coup.</p>

  <p>I will give all evidence required, and If I'm asked I shall mention the
  fact that my wife was present."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not your wife," said Pat.</p>

  <p>"You will be by then," said Peter.</p>
