  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;A BIT OF EGYPT</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY DUDLEY HARDY</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLIV, Jul 1916, pp
  233-240</h3>

  <p class="first">FROM Paradine's point of view&mdash;and that, after all, was
  the outlook that most concerned him&mdash;the tiny block of flats on Campden
  Hill was the breeziest and most picturesque prospect in London. For Capel
  Hill Court had at one time been what the auctioneers call a "desirable family
  residence standing in its own grounds," before the inside had been torn out
  and subsequently refitted with an electric lift and a commissionaire in
  scarlet uniform, a telephone switchboard, and what is known as "every modern
  convenience." The garden still remained intact, and Paradine occupied one of
  the pair of flats on the top floor, from the roof of which he could look down
  into the gardens and away over the high ground to the distant Surrey Hills.
  And it had been his whim to erect a tent on the flat roof, and surround
  himself with flowers and shrubs in imitation of the hanging gardens of
  Babylon. On summer evenings, when he was in the mood, he was wont to sit out
  there in ruminating solitude, and work out those brilliant problems of his
  for the benefit of suffering mankind. For Paradine was one of those fortunate
  individuals well endowed with this world's goods, who could afford to pick
  and choose in the field of surgical science&mdash;in other words, he was a
  brain specialist, attracted only by certain phases of cerebral disorders and
  diseases, or the troubles brought about by accident or catastrophe. Unless a
  case appealed to him, he declined to take it. He would have nothing whatever
  to do with the ordinary "mental" case, and turned his back resolutely upon
  fashionable "nerve" patients, brought about by luxurious living or that
  selfish introspection which is often the result of too ample means and too
  little healthy occupation.</p>

  <p>It was rarely, indeed, that anybody shared Paradine's solitude on what he
  called his lonely mountain height. And his next-door neighbour was probably
  unaware of the fact that he also had an exit on the garden roof. For the
  next-door neighbour was no less a person than Professor Ionedes, the famous
  Egyptologist and recognised authority on prehistoric coinage. As a matter of
  fact, Paradine had hardly ever seen his neighbour, who was an elderly man of
  pure Greek descent, and a master of many languages. Paradine knew by repute,
  of course, that the flat adjacent to his contained the finest collection of
  gold coins in the world; he knew, too, that his neighbour was a somewhat
  eccentric recluse, and that he was frequently absent from London on one of
  his many excavating expeditions. And when Ionedes was in the metropolis, he
  rarely showed himself in society, he had practically no visitors, and was
  looked after in a perfunctory sort of way by a charwoman, who came over in
  the mornings to do the necessary cleaning and get the Professor's breakfast.
  The rest of his modest meals the great numismatist took in an obscure little
  restaurant in Kensington High Street. All this Paradine knew in the way of
  vague gossip which filtered to him from time to time through the medium of
  his own servants. He was aware, too, that some year or two before an attempt
  at burglary, doubtless with a view to the gold coins, had been made on the
  Professor's flat, and that since then the front door thereof had been fitted
  with a steel lining, beyond which it was impossible to penetrate without the
  possession of the master-key. All this interested Paradine quite in a languid
  way.</p>

  <p>Certainly he was not thinking about it that perfect June evening, as he
  sat there under the shadow of his palms in a comfortable arm-chair, looking
  out dreamily across the gardens to the blue hills in the distance. As a
  matter of fact, he was working out the details of a case, the fine definite
  points of an operation which he had decided to make on a patient at that
  moment lying unconscious in a hospital off the Brompton Road. The train of
  thought was nearly complete, when it was rudely derailed by the sound of a
  noise and the heavy thud of a falling body, apparently just underneath.</p>

  <p>Paradine jumped to his feet and looked eagerly about him. So far he could
  see nothing, for the well and sufficient reason that there was nothing to
  see. He peered down the wooden stairway which led through the water-tank in
  the roof of his own flat on to the ledge beyond, but he could see nothing
  there. He was about to return to his chair again, when he heard the heavy
  thud once more, coming unmistakably, or so it seemed, from the direction of
  the flat next door. Paradine crossed the leads and squinted through the
  gloomy skylight that was situated immediately over Professor Ionedes' flat.
  From all appearance, the glass skylight had not been touched for years, for
  the panes were dusty and grimy, and the woodwork fitted into the roof almost
  as if it had been fixed there. Paradine told himself that it was no business
  of his, before he recollected that the Professor was quite alone, that he was
  elderly, and that something might have happened to him. If this was the case,
  and the front door was closed, then it would be impossible for anyone to
  enter from the outside in the ordinary way. Reflecting on this, and the
  necessity for something to be done at once, Paradine bent down and devoted
  all his energies to raising the skylight. It gave way presently with a sudden
  jerk, and Paradine found himself looking down through the water-tank into a
  small sort of store-room below, which appeared to be empty, save for a few
  packing-cases and something that looked like a human form sprawling on the
  floor. There was no ladder leading from the roof into the room below. If
  there had been one, the Professor would probably have had it removed. As
  Paradine's eyes became accustomed to the same gloom, he saw the figure down
  there gradually raise itself, and a white, pleasant-looking face was turned
  eagerly upwards.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing there?" Paradine asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hardly know," the stranger replied. "Who do you happen to be,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it for me to ask questions?" Paradine said dryly. "I happen to be
  the occupant of one of these top flats. My name is Paradine, at your
  service."</p>

  <p>"Very pleased to hear it," the man at the bottom of the shaft said
  thankfully. "If you wouldn't mind reaching down and giving me a hand, I'll
  come up and explain."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think not. Not just at present, anyway. You see, I happen to be
  top dog for the moment, and, until you can convince me that my policy is
  wrong, I propose to remain so. You see, I know something of Professor
  Ionedes, on whose premises you are at the present moment, and, frankly, my
  dear friend, appearances are decidedly against you. Now, Professor Ionedes
  lives entirely alone; he is an old man, with a rooted aversion to visitors,
  which is, perhaps, inspired by the fact that his flat is full of gold coins,
  which take up little space, and are always worth their face value in the
  precious metal. Moreover, I know that no one could leave that flat without
  the Professor's sanction when once the steel-lined front door is closed.
  Therefore, when I find a stranger&mdash;even a well-dressed stranger with a
  charming manner like yours&mdash; attempting to leave the flat by such a
  dubious method as the skylight, my suspicions are naturally aroused. For all
  I know to the contrary, you may have murdered that picturesque old
  numismatist for the sake of his coins, and found yourself in a trap
  afterwards. Such being the case, I must decline."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, listen to me!" the other man burst out. "I am not
  going to deny that part of what you say is true. I am not going to deny that
  I am cut off here, and that I am trying to escape by means of the skylight. I
  piled up some of these cases on the floor, and, when I was balancing myself
  on the top of them, the whole contraption collapsed and let me down badly.
  That was the noise that you heard. But when you accuse me of murdering the
  Professor, then you are talking absolute nonsense. As a matter of fact, he's
  not in the flat at all. I came here this evening to see him by appointment,
  and, after ringing the bell two or three times, a man came to the door."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man?" Paradine asked.</p>

  <p>"A tall, dark chap getting on in life, with black hair and beard. When I
  explained my business to him, he asked me into the dining-room, and told me
  that the Professor would see me in a few minutes. Then he put some fez
  arrangement on his head and walked out of the flat, banging the front door
  behind him. I waited a quarter of an hour, and, after ringing the bell two or
  three times, it dawned upon me that something was wrong. So I started to
  explore the flat, and found that the place was absolutely empty. There wasn't
  a soul on the premises, either in the bed- or living-rooms. And when I tried
  to get out, and spotted that steel-lined door, with its spring lock, I knew
  that I had been trapped by some thief whom I had probably interrupted when I
  rang the front-door bell. I knew then that I was in a tight place, and when I
  found that one of the Professor's most valuable coin cabinets had been broken
  open, I was aware of my danger. When I recovered myself, I cast about for
  some means of escape. I knew I shouldn't be believed, I knew that I should be
  accused of taking what was missing from the cabinet, and that's why I hit
  upon the desperate expedient of getting away by the medium of the roof, and
  trusting myself to reach the street through the help of another flat, without
  being discovered. And that's the Gospel truth. Perhaps, if you weren't
  wearing a Bullingdon Club tie I shouldn't have the courage to tell you
  this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you were at Oxford, too?" Paradine asked.</p>

  <p>"I was. Name of Felton."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>the</i> Jimmy Felton?"</p>

  <p>"The same, worst 1uck to it. And, now I come to look at you, I see a
  strong likeness to the chap that we used to call Tomahawk Paradine. Am I
  right?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard worse guesses," Paradine said. "But look here, I can't take
  your word for all this, you know. You may have gone to pot, for all I know to
  the contrary. You might have taken to burglary as a profession."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I can see all that, of course. But I'm telling you the truth,
  Paradine. If you don't believe me, come down and see for yourself. Bring a
  revolver with you, if you like. Anyway, you won't find the Professor
  here."</p>

  <p>Paradine weakened suddenly.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "I'll take your word for it. Now, hold out your
  hand, and I'll give you a leg up."</p>

  <p>The man called Felton scrambled to the roof with a sigh of relief, and
  sank breathlessly into an arm-chair. He availed himself generously of
  Paradine's invitation to sample the contents of the tantalus, and lighted a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to go over the flat," he asked, "and satisfy yourself that
  the aged Professor is not weltering in his own gore? In other words, are you
  satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Well, partly," Paradine said. "If there had been any violence, you would
  not be sitting in that chair talking to me in this collected way. If there is
  anything wrong, you would be only too anxious to get away."</p>

  <p>A deep groan burst from Felton's lips.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I am in no end of a hole," he said, " and I want you
  to help me out, if you can. In fact, no one else can save me; and, upon my
  word, I don't believe even <i>you</i> can when the truth comes to be
  told."</p>

  <p>"Let's have it," Paradine said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this. I also am a collector of coins in a modest sort of
  way, and, without flattery, there are only two men in the world who know more
  of what I might call pre-numismatism than I do. Professor Ionedes is one, and
  a queer sort of semi-Arab Johnny called Ali Khan is the other. I have never
  met Ali Khan, but, in the light of events during the past hour or two, if he
  isn't the chap who let me into old Ionedes' flat, then I'll eat him, fez and
  all! But I'm getting on a bit too fast. Do you know anything about coins,
  Paradine?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, I am sorry to say."</p>

  <p>"Then I'd better explain. Now, I suppose Professor Ionedes' collection is
  absolutely complete as regards the gold coins extant before the beginning of
  the Christian Era. Ionedes has every one of the coins. There is only one gold
  piece that he lacked up to a year ago, and this he found in a mummy case
  whilst exploring in Egypt a few months back. He was exploring the same
  pyramid that Ali Khan was working on&mdash;in fact, they were both looking
  for that particular medallion that has been a tradition amongst numismatists
  for generations. And the Professor found it. Ali Khan said that the Greek
  found it before it was lost&mdash; in other words, they were both on the same
  track, and the Arab was beaten by a short head&mdash;a matter of seconds, I
  believe it was. Anyway, there was a fierce quarrel that nearly ended in
  physical violence. You will see why I tell you all this presently."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Paradine said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, the coin in question is called a Di-Drachma. It is a small gold
  disc with the figure of a turtle on the obverse side, and on the reverse a
  design that is not unlike the fifth proposition of the first book of Euclid.
  It is a Lydian coin, and, experts say, the first token in gold ever struck in
  the world. When I tell you that there is no mention of coinage throughout the
  whole of the poems of Homer, you will be able to get some idea of the age of
  the coin. It was probably struck by Pheilon of Argos in B.C. 895. I don't
  know what the turtle means, but it is a symbol of some kind, of course. And
  this is the coin that numismatists have been trying to find for ages. And
  Ionedes has it, beyond the shadow of a doubt. When I say has it, I ought to
  have said <i>had</i> it, because it is no longer in his collection."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" Paradine asked.</p>

  <p>"Because it's gone, my boy, vanished&mdash; stolen from its place in the
  drawer by that blackguard Ali Khan, who opened the flat door for me, and
  subsequently shut me in. I told you that, when I found out how I had been
  trapped, I went all over the flat and found, amongst other things, that one
  of the Professor's cabinets had been forced open. In the space amongst the
  Lydian coins which was obviously reserved for the precious Di-Drachma in the
  cabinet was nothing but a pad of cotton-wool, and therefore I came to the
  conclusion that I had interrupted Ali Khan just at the moment when he had
  laid his hand upon the coveted coin. The old rascal was cunning enough, when
  he saw how the land lay, to make a clever exit, and leave me to face the
  infuriated Professor when he came back. Of course, he would swear point-blank
  that he had never seen me before, that he had never been in Ionedes' flat,
  and that my story is an absolute fraud. Now you see the position Fate has
  placed me in, and why I was so anxious to crawl out of the flat at any risk.
  But, of course, things can't stay as they are, and, at the same time, nobody
  would accept my explanation. Nothing would convince the Professor that I
  haven't stolen his Di-Drachma and cunningly hidden it till it was safe for me
  to go and pick up the beastly thing again."</p>

  <p>"In fact, couldn't be worse," Paradine suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, couldn't it? That's all you know about it. It can be a jolly lot
  worse. Look here!"</p>

  <p>With which Felton produced from his pocket a roughly-cast gold coin of
  small size, bearing on one side the imprint of a turtle and on the other that
  of an irregular parallelogram. This he handed over for Paradine's
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"This is the genuine Di-Drachma he said. "There can be no shadow of a
  doubt as to its authenticity."</p>

  <p>"Then you did steal it, after all," Paradine exclaimed. "In that case, why
  did you tell me "</p>

  <p>"Here, half a minute, old man. I am only proving to you how it can be ever
  so much worse than you thought, because that coin belongs to me, and I had it
  in my pocket when I called on the Professor this evening. What do you think
  of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, frankly, I don't, believe you," Paradine said bluntly. "Dash it,
  man, you can't expect me to swallow a story like that. You tell me that there
  is only one Di-Drachma in the world, and then you calmly produce another from
  your pocket, like a conjuror juggling with a couple of rabbits. And,
  moreover, you tell me that the original gold token has recently been stolen
  from the Professor's flat. My dear fellow, what particular brand of ass do
  you take me for?"</p>

  <p>"I knew you'd talk like that," Felton said resignedly. "But don't forget
  that I voluntarily produced the coin which is in your hand. I wasn't bound to
  do it, you know. I could have gone away without your being any the wiser on
  the subject. But, because you have trusted me, I have put all the cards in
  this exceedingly complicated game on the table."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough," Paradine admitted.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Now, perhaps, you will let me go on. I bought that coin,
  strange as it may seem, from a little general shop in a back street leading
  off Theobald's Road. I bought it about a week ago. It is a tiny shop, where
  they sell dilapidated second-hand furniture and cast-off wardrobes and things
  of that sort&mdash;a dirty, dingy little place, where obviously the
  proprietor was struggling hard for a bare living. In fact, there was a sale
  going on at the time, under distress for rent. I happened to be passing by,
  and I looked in, and in a box of rubbish, tokens and cast-off medals, I
  lighted on that coin. To make a long story short, I bought the whole lot for
  half-a-crown. Oh, it's a genuine Di-Drachma, right enough, and you can
  imagine my delight when I discovered the value of my treasure. As soon as I
  had satisfied myself that it was genuine, I wrote to Professor Ionedes, and
  asked him if I might be allowed to have a sight of his famous Lydian token.
  Of course, I didn't mention what I had got, and in the course of a day or two
  I had a post-card from him, asking me to call upon him this evening at six
  o'clock. In the light of what I told you, it is quite evident that he forgot
  all about the appointment, or, what is much more probable, he was lured away
  from his flat by that scoundrel Ali Khan, who had all his preparations made
  for the robbery, which' he successfully accomplished. The rest you know. And
  now you can believe me or not, as you please. I admit everything is against
  me, I don't suppose that I shall be able to produce the man from whom I
  purchased that disc&mdash;he is probably lost sight of by this time&mdash;but
  I have told you my story, and I am going to ask you to help me all you can.
  What do you suggest I'd better do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Paradine said. "Are you prepared to leave this token
  in my hands?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you like. But what do you gain by that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a guarantee of your <i>bona fides</i>, for one thing. This
  matter will take some thinking over. You'd better give me your address where
  I can write to you, and I'll see the Professor for you in the morning. If we
  do anything in a hurry, the worst construction will be put upon it, and you
  may find yourself answering a charge at Bow Street. You leave it to me. I
  dare say I shall think of something."</p>

  <p>But morning found Paradine still in two moods, and it was nearly
  lunch-time before his housekeeper came to him with an intimation that a
  gentleman wished to see him. In his dining-room he found a little man with
  nice manners and much politeness, who introduced himself as Inspector Close,
  from Scotland Yard, coupled with the information, pleasantly conveyed, that
  he was armed with a search warrant, and that he proposed to go over the flat,
  with a view to finding a gold coin which was missing from the residence of
  Professor Ionedes next door.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you, Mr. Paradine," he said, "that this is a most unpleasant
  business, and I am bound to tell you, moreover, that, unless I am satisfied,
  I have a further warrant for your own arrest. But no doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It can't be done," Paradine exclaimed. "I've got a most important
  consultation at five o'clock this afternoon, in connection with a patient who
  is lying dangerously hurt in a private hospital off the Brompton Road. I am a
  brain specialist, as you know, and the whole thing was fixed up on the
  telephone only half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>Inspector Close smiled as the god in the car might have done. It was not a
  pleasant smile.</p>

  <p>"It might be done," he said thoughtfully, "but it rests entirely with
  yourself. The Professor doesn't want to prosecute, if he can help it, and he
  is prepared to listen to any story, however improbable, if he gets his
  missing disc back. You see, it's like this, sir. Nobody can get into the
  Professor's flat without his own key, which is never out of his possession.
  He went out yesterday afternoon, intending to return at six o'clock, and when
  he came back, after being detained, he let himself into the empty flat, the
  door of which was properly closed, and evidently had been untampered with.
  Despite this fact, a cabinet had been forced open, and a unique coin
  extracted&mdash;in fact, the only specimen of that coin in the world. The
  Professor promptly telephoned to Scotland Yard, and I was sent round to
  investigate. It did not take me many minutes to discover that the flat had
  been entered through the skylight by someone who obviously had access to the
  roof. Now, your flat alone gives access to the roof, and the thief must have
  used your flat for the purpose of the robbery&mdash;in fact, it could have
  taken place in no other way. But, of course, if you can prove your innocence
  "</p>

  <p>The detective shrugged his shoulders and paused eloquently. Paradine stood
  there, trying to grasp the points of this new and unexpected situation. It
  was all the more complicated by the fact that at that very moment he had the
  Di-Drachma in his waistcoat pocket. Nothing would be gained by the detective
  searching the flat, he knew, but if the officer of the law insisted upon
  taking him round to Bow Street, then the murder would be out, and nothing
  could prevent him standing his trial on a charge of stealing the coin. Just
  at that moment he was regretting at the bottom of his heart that the goddess
  of Chance had brought him in contact with Felton. For the next minute or two
  he did some pretty quick thinking, then he plunged his hand into his pocket
  and produced the gold coin.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you are looking for?" he asked. "Because, if you're in
  search of a gold Di-Drachma, then this is one, beyond the shadow of a doubt.
  I don't know whether you would like to listen to my explanation or
  not&mdash;probably you would not believe it in any case&mdash;so, if you want
  me to accompany you as far as Bow Street, I am quite prepared to do so. But I
  must say that I have never been inside Professor Ionedes' flat, and that I
  decline for the moment to say how that coin came into my possession. Perhaps,
  on the whole, for the moment I had better say nothing. I am thinking at the
  present moment more about that case of mine. Now, if I am charged with that
  robbery, is it possible for me to get bail? I only mean till to-morrow
  morning, because I must go down to Brompton Road, as a human life probably
  hangs on my attendance."</p>

  <p>"I think that will be all right, sir," Close said. "There could be no
  possible objection on the part of the police to accept bail for the
  appearance of so well-known a gentleman as yourself. I suggest that you write
  a note to a friend or two, asking them to come round to Bow Street this
  afternoon, and I will see that the notes are delivered. Probably, when
  Professor Ionedes gets his coin back, he will not be disposed to prosecute,
  in which case you will hear no more of the matter."</p>

  <p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon before Paradine emerged from the
  seclusion of a whitewashed cell into the open air, accompanied by two
  indignant scientists of his acquaintance and an apologetic groveller in the
  person of Felton, who offered to do anything up to suicide, if by so
  sacrificing himself he could put matters straight. So far, nothing had been
  seen or heard of the Professor, and it was quite uncertain as to whether he
  would turn up in the morning to substantiate his charge or not, though
  Inspector Close was of the opinion that, as he had got his coin back, nothing
  further would be heard of the matter. Paradine listened calmly enough.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't worry me," he said to the distracted Felton. "If I hadn't been
  a good-natured fool, I should never have found myself in this mess. And,
  besides, I've got other things to think about. I must be off to Brompton Road
  now, in any case. If you want to help, the best thing you can do is to go
  plunging around and see if you can hit upon the track of that picturesque
  Arab who has been the cause of all the mischief."</p>

  <p>With which, Paradine dismissed the whole thing from his mind, and made his
  way as promptly as possible in the direction of the Brompton Road and the
  private hospital there. For the moment, at any rate, he had put the whole of
  the trouble out of his mind, and was thinking of nothing else besides the
  interesting case which was waiting his attention. A flippant-minded surgeon,
  with a watch in his hand, met Paradine on the doorstep.</p>

  <p>"You're a nice chap," he said. "I've been waiting for you for a couple of
  hours, with my own patients performing solos on the telephone every two
  minutes. Been lunching at the Carlo, I suppose, or something equally
  important.'*</p>

  <p>"Weil, not precisely," Paradine said grimly. "Here, sit down and tell me
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"He's a foreigner," the other man said. "Picturesque, middle-aged ruffian
  with a black beard. He was knocked down last night, somewhere in Kensington,
  by a motor lorry, and taken to St. Jacob's. The house-surgeon there saw that
  it was a case for you, and telephoned to know if he should send the chap
  round here. So they brought him on a motor ambulance, and he is upstairs at
  the present moment. I've been all over him myself, but for the life of me I
  can't find anything wrong anywhere. There are no bones broken and no signs of
  a fracture, but the man's unconscious and absolutely paralysed. The funny
  thing is that his colour is quite good, and his pulse and heart quite normal.
  And now I must be off."</p>

  <p>It was quite a couple of hours later before Paradine had completed his
  diagnosis of the unfortunate patient. He was an elderly man, with clean-cut
  features and square, fighting jaw, an Eastern beyond question, as his swarthy
  complexion and black eyes testified. Paradine was not easily puzzled, but for
  a long time the source of the trouble baffled him. Then he went over all the
  ground again, and presently the frown lifted from his forehead, and he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here it is," he said, turning to one of the nurses who was holding
  his instruments. "A small matter enough, but quite sufficient. There has been
  an injury to the spine right at the base of the brain, a minute displacement
  of the vertebrae. There's a hole there you can put your finger into. The
  brain itself is untouched."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to operate?" the nurse asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly useless," Paradine replied. "If that poor fellow moves half an
  inch, he will be dead. I can remove things, but no surgeon ever yet could
  replace an injured bit of spine. He is literally hanging on a thread. As I
  said just now, as soon as he moves he's done for. You'd better go through his
  belongings and communicate with his friends. Were there any letters or
  anything of that kind on him?"</p>

  <p>"They are on the table there," the nurse explained&mdash;"one or two
  letters, evidently from some scientific society in the East, together with a
  watch and chain and a purse and a little case with a gold coin in it."</p>

  <p>Paradine reached over eagerly and grabbed the shabby little leather case
  that lay on the table. He threw back the lid with trembling fingers, and
  there before his astonished and delighted eyes he saw a Di-Drachma. There was
  no doubt about it; the thing had been burnt too deeply in his memory for him
  to make a mistake. There it lay, with the imprint of a turtle on the one side
  and the crude mathejnatical design on the other. Beyond the shadow of a
  doubt, by sheer good luck Paradine had found the stolen medallion, and was
  looking down into the unconscious eyes of the thief himself. For beyond
  question Ali Khan was lying on the bed there, stricken down with mortal
  illness, no doubt inflicted upon him at the very moment when he was hurrying
  off from the Professor's flat with his ill-gotten gain.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Paradine had called up Felton on the telephone, and was
  hurrying back homewards as fast as a taxi could carry him. He had hardly rid
  himself of his glossy hat and immaculate morning coat before a pale and
  dishevelled Felton fell headlong into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"Mean to say you've found him?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I have," Paradine said, " and only just in time, too. It was a bit of
  sheer good luck. And upon my word, after all that has happened, I think we
  deserve it. As I told you this afternoon, when we were leaving Bow Street, I
  had a most important appointment at a private hospital in Brompton
  Road&mdash;a foreigner knocked down in Kensington High Street and seriously
  injured by a motor lorry. I went to see if an operation would be any good;
  but the patient was past all that kind of thing, and it's any odds he's dead
  by this time. I told the nurse in charge that I could do no good, and advised
  her to communicate with the man's friends. She showed me his letters and
  belongings, and also told me that he had been possessed of an old gold coin
  that he carried in a leather case. As I am particularly interested just now
  in old gold coins, I asked to see it. Here it is. I took the liberty of
  bringing it away with me, and if it isn't the Professor's missing Di-Drachma,
  then I am cruelly mistaken. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond the shadow of a doubt," Felton cried. "What blind good fortune
  that you should have been called in to attend the actual thief! Oh, that's
  the coin all right. Then I suppose the next thing is to go and see the
  Professor, and convince him that he has got my coin, and that this is his. He
  won't believe it unless we produce the actual token. So let's get along and
  finish it without delay."</p>

  <p>It was some little time before the suspicious Professor, doubtless with
  the fear of violence before his eyes, consented to open his front door wide
  enough to admit the two intruders, and, indeed, he would probably have
  refused then had not Paradine produced the second coin and dangled it before
  his astonished and crestfallen gaze.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "that is a genuine Di-Drachma all right. And I thought
  that there was only one of them in the world&mdash;I mean the stolen one,
  which is now safe in my cabinet again. But please come inside, gentlemen, and
  let us talk this matter over."</p>

  <p>At the end of half an hour the Professor expressed himself satisfied,
  though he still looked uncomfortable and ill at ease as he made the necessary
  exchange of coins, and, with a reluctance which he made no effort to conceal,
  handed Felton's property over to him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that that rascally Arab must in some way have obtained an
  impression of the key of my front door," he said, "otherwise I cannot account
  for the way in which he got into my flat. It is an extraordinary story
  altogether, and, but for the evidence in Mr. Felton's hands, I would never
  have believed it. To think that two of those coins were in existence! And the
  worst of it is that the value of mine is depreciated at least one half by the
  fact that there is a counterpart. Only a numismatist like Mr. Felton can
  understand my feelings. Now, Mr. Felton, I'm a rich man, and able to gratify
  my whims. Shall we say five thousand pounds for your Di-Drachma?"</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Done!" Felton said promptly. "It's yours."</p>

  <p>It was a highly delighted Felton who followed Paradine into his flat a few
  minutes later.</p>

  <p>"Funny story, isn't it?" he said. "Pity it can't be written, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody'd believe it if you did," Paradine replied, "and, if you ask me,
  you are jolly well out of it."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">2.&mdash;THE GREY BAT</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Western Mail</i>, Perth, Australia, 14 Jul
  1916</h3><br>

  <p class="first">The door opening into Oldaker's sitting room opened and a
  figure crept in. Then the door closed, and a woman stood with her back to it,
  swaying slightly with her hand to her side as if she were short of breath.
  Visions of Charlotte Corday crossed Oldaker's mind. He looked for the quick
  gleam of a revolver, but none came. The woman moved a step forward with a
  quick movement, and threw off her long wrap. There was something dramatic
  about it.</p>

  <p>"Princess," Oldaker exclaimed, "Princess Elizabeth of&mdash; What in the
  name&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Betty," the Princess corrected eagerly. "Know that I am in the deepest
  trouble, my dear&mdash;Dick."</p>

  <p>Something warm and rapturous played about Oldaker's heart. He was young
  and romantic; he was an Oldaker of Barons court, and the princess was
  beautiful. She must have known that herself, for Dick had told her so several
  times lately. They had seen a good deal of each other at Monte Carlo, and
  Dick had begun to dream dreams. And when one of the most daring and
  successful of aviators begins to dream dreams, he is in a bad way.</p>

  <p>He knew he had no business to be in the Asturian capital at all. To
  suggest that the aviation ground there was better than a score of others was
  ridiculous. Besides, there was trouble brewing in Marenna. The Progressives
  looked like getting the upper hand, and King George had gone to Merum at a
  most critical time. Even his own followers were muttering of cowardice under
  their breath. There were many more delectable spots in Europe than Marenna
  just now. Still, Princess Elizabeth was there.</p>

  <p>She came close to him, and laid her hands on his shoulders. It was a
  sweet, dainty pleading face, and there was something in the expression of it
  that set Dick's heart beating madly. And the glint in that golden hair!</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said softly. "You love me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Princess or no princess, there was only one thing to do after that. Dick
  had the slender, palpitating figure cuddled up in his arms, his lips were
  pressed to hers. There was something intoxicating in the fragrance of the
  spungold hair.</p>

  <p>"I've done it!" Dick smiled presently. "Good Lord! my cheek! I shall have
  to go away, Betty. King George&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I knew I should have to ask you," Betty smiled demurely. "My dear boy,
  the situation is not quite so original as you suppose. Besides, there were
  Oldakers in Baronscourt long before the Asoffs came to Asturia. And on your
  mother's side you are related to the wealthiest financiers in Europe. Even if
  only on that score&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dick, thoughtfully. "I've got a tidy chunk of bullion. And
  ever since we first met&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, dear; you loved me. And I loved you, Dicky. And I always get
  my own way&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>"And so you came here this afternoon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I came because my sister, the queen, is in great distress. They say that
  George has fled to Merum. He had to go there."</p>

  <p>"Never heard that King George had been accused of want of pluck before,
  Betty."'</p>

  <p>"My dear, the poor man is as brave as you are. They are an artful lot,
  those conspirators. They have stirred up a nest of trouble both here and at
  Merum. When George is at Merum Marenna thinks he has gone away into hiding,
  and when he is here, Merum thinks he has deserted her."</p>

  <p>"But no man can be in two places at the same time, Betty."</p>

  <p>"There, my dear Dick," she said demurely, "is where I fail to agree with
  you. If the king could be here at midnight the situation would be saved. He
  wants to come here secretly and quietly at a moment when the conspirators are
  absolutely certain that he is at Merum. Then news must come from Merum that
  George is on his way here. In the ordinary way it would be a matter of hours.
  And then within an hour or two of striking hard here he must be at Merum
  again. Consider the paralysing effect of the whole thing; look at the
  dramatic possibilities of the situation."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Betty, it is a physical impossibility. It can't be
  done!"</p>

  <p>"Really, Dick? Can't you see the way? I have sent a message to the king.
  He will expect you. And you will get him here before midnight, and back to
  Merum before daybreak. And you, above all men, tell me it can't be done."</p>

  <p>"It is fearfully risky," he said. "In the daytime I should think nothing
  of it. But as you point out, daylight for our purpose is useless. It's the
  striking moral effect you're after. You deal a staggering blow in two places
  at once. And to leave the foe marvelling how it is done is the way to final
  victory. But it's dangerous, Betty."</p>

  <p>The Princess looked grave and troubled. There was a suggestion of tears in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said. "Ever since the idea came to me I have struggled
  against my own feelings. I am pulled this way and that. If&mdash;if anything
  happened to you, Dick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't think of that for the moment, dear," Dick said tenderly. "Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"Well, I felt bound to ask. And you are ready to go. I hoped you'd say no
  and yet I'm awfully proud and glad to find you so willing. George's whole
  heart is in his work and my sister, the Queen, loves her people. It would
  break her heart if anything happened. George must be here tonight. I don't
  say he is being actually kept a prisoner at Merum, but there are obstacles
  placed in his way&mdash;trouble on the line, a sudden breakdown in the
  garage. You understand."</p>

  <p>"You can communicate with the King?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I have already done so. By secret code. George knows exactly
  what I am proposing to you. He will be all ready. The great light in the
  castle at Merum will be your guide. Between the Tower and St. Simon's church,
  where there is an illuminated clock, are gardens, great gardens laid out in
  the Italian fashion ages ago. If you make no noise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall make no noise. You should see my new engines. I suppose King
  George has a few people he can rely upon to keep silence."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are plenty of them, Dick. Then you'll do it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll do it, darling."</p>

  <p>The Princess kissed him tenderly.</p>

  <p>"You're a hero," she whispered. "My hero, and I'll marry you though all
  the armies in Europe try to stop me. There never was any man but you, Dick,
  from the day we met. And you are going to save Asturia. If you can do this
  thing there will be no more trouble here. And you will come back to the
  castle with him. He may need your services. And I would like to know that you
  are safe."</p>

  <p>She slipped her wrap over her head again and vanished. The happiest man in
  Europe lighted a cigarette. He had promised to enter upon a mad enterprise.
  And he was not in the least afraid. When the gods throw a beautiful Princess
  into the arms of a mere mortal man it is clearly up to them to see the
  business through.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was pitch dark and the hour near ten when Dick Oldaker
  picked his way through the Italian garden on the west front of the castle at
  Merum and fumbled in the direction of a lighted window on the ground floor.
  The window was open and Oldaker slipped through without hesitation. He
  dropped the blind back in its place and looked around him. From an American
  desk a man in uniform arose and approached the intruder with outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You are the bravest man I ever met, Mr. Oldaker," the King said. "I
  congratulate you and I congratulate&mdash;the Princess Elizabeth. Oh, yes,
  she has told me everything. I shall not interfere. An Oldaker of Baronscourt
  is a fit mate for an Azoff any day. You had a safe journey?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, your majesty," Dick replied, "My monoplane got here in an
  hour. There was no mishap at all. Your men appear to be discreet and silent.
  They did exactly as I told them."</p>

  <p>The King, paced thoughtfully up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," he said. "Wonderful! With ordinary good fortune I shall
  strike two blows before daybreak that will end the trouble once and for all.
  When can we start back?"</p>

  <p>"I am ready to start at this moment, your Majesty," Dick replied. "I have
  brought with me everything that is necessary for you in the way of clothing.
  The sooner we start the better."</p>

  <p>"Then I will join you in the garden in ten minutes," the King replied. "I
  am supposed to be leaving for my capital at once by coach. The trains are
  broken down, there is no motor to be had. I shall merely go in my coach as
  far as the gates and then slip out, leaving the vehicle to proceed. I have a
  few faithful followers in the secret. Directly I am on my way the traitors in
  Marenna will be advised that I shall reach my capital some time tomorrow.
  Long before daybreak I shall be back here to deliver the second blow. I shall
  have the rascals yet."</p>

  <p>Dick murmured his approval of these suggestions. Ten minutes later the
  King joined him in the garden. As the clocks at Marenna were on the stroke of
  midnight an astonished lackey staggered backwards as he saw the King come
  softly along the corridor of the Palace. The miracle had happened.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," the King commanded. "Not a word to a soul as you value your
  liberty. Where is Nikolof and the rest of them. Tell me?"</p>

  <p>The menial stammered something about the council Chamber, and the King
  strode on. A door at the end of the corridor opened, and a white face looked
  out. The face smiled dazzlingly and the blue eyes filled with happy tears as
  they fell on Dick.</p>

  <p>There was a wave of the hand and the door closed again. Dick staggered
  along with his head erect and his heart swelling.</p>

  <p>"Where shall I wait for your Majesty?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You shall come with me," the King said. "You shall see what you shall
  see. At any rate you'll see that your part has not been in vain."</p>

  <p>The stream of the adventure was running bankful. Oldaker plunged into it
  with wholehearted joy. There was the uplifting sense that he was helping to
  make history. A little knot of men for the most part in uniform were gathered
  round a table illuminated by one shaded bunch of electrics.</p>

  <p>The rest of the big gloomy apartment was in darkness. The King strode
  forward and grasped the neck of the man who sat with his back to the door,
  and dragged him from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Who sits in my chair?" he cried. "Who but the twice-pardoned Lipski? So
  this is how my faithful ministers labour in my absence? What is the document
  you are considering? Oh, coquetting with Teutonia, are we? Rise, all of you.
  Mr. Oldaker, would you be so good as to pull back those curtains and open the
  window?"</p>

  <p>A clock ticked heavily in the painful silence, the metallic jingle of the
  curtain rings as they clicked back sounded like pistol shots. A ring of
  pale-faced men stood round the table, silent, disconcerted, incredulity in
  their downcast eyes. Oldaker turned to the great quadrangle below the open
  window. In the velvet violet night electric lights gleamed everywhere, the
  streets were full of people, the theatres and halls were emptying. Suddenly
  the council chamber blazed with light, the brilliant uniforms were picked out
  from the street like striking stage pictures. The King, with his hand still
  on Lipski's neck, impelled him towards the window.</p>

  <p>"You traitor," he cried. "Traitors every one of you. And so you tell my
  people I am deserting them while all the time I am at Merum fighting the rest
  of your gang. You thought that I was there still, that I could not possibly
  get away. But there are ways, there are ways."</p>

  <p>The King's voice was pitched high, every word he said was carried to the
  street below. The roadway was blocked now by a breathless, hustling crowd.
  King George pushed the flaccid Lipski into the window recess and held him
  there. A ripple of cheers broke from the crowd below, it swelled into a
  deafening roar, it stopped as suddenly as if it had been cut with a knife.
  The star was on the stage and the audience eager to hear him.</p>

  <p>"Behold a traitor," the King cried. "Lipski, whose life I saved. Behold
  the other liars cringing in the background. And these are the men by whom you
  were asked to choose someone to take my place. I hope you are proud of them.
  But I am back, and I am back just in time."</p>

  <p>As the King paused, a vast sigh went up from the street, a sigh, and no
  more.</p>

  <p>"They called me pleasure-loving and easy-going. It is a lie. Was I easy
  and pleasure-seeking for ten whole years when I lived in a tent defending my
  frontier and never during that time slept in a bed? For the Queen's sake I
  slacked the bow and took the month of holiday that I was conceited enough to
  feel I had earned. I was wrong."</p>

  <p>A storm of protest broke from the street. The King smiled, and in that
  moment Oldaker knew that the battle was won. George whispered a word in his
  ear. Oldaker came back from the table a moment later with the secret treaty
  in his hand. The King crashed it down on Lipski's head so that the paper
  broke and hung round the traitor's neck like a ham frill. The crowd below
  rocked with mirth.</p>

  <p>"Take him," the King cried, "and treat him as he deserves. We have done
  with him here."</p>

  <p>He raised Lipski in his arms as if he had been a child and tossed him
  through the window. He fell into a thicket of laurels below. There was a wild
  rush in his direction as King George slammed the window down and pulled the
  curtain across.</p>

  <p>"They will be making jest of this in the music halls to-morrow. Lipski's
  power has gone. Nothing kills a political reputation more than ridicule."</p>

  <p>"And what shall I say to the rest of you?" he demanded. "Is there not one
  honest man among you? You thought I was no more than a blunt soldier
  unskilled in the ways of diplomacy. I was the Mars who had forsaken his arms
  at the call of Venus. I was warned against Lipski, but I trusted him. And
  when I came to my senses it was nearly too late. But for this brave and
  gallant gentleman here I should have been too late. It was he who solved the
  problem whereby I could be in two places at the same lime. Before daybreak I
  shall be back at Merum and Staffanoff will come with me to bear testimony to
  the truth of what I say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An old faded grey man in the background shuffled uneasily. A gentle bead
  of perspiration glistened on Staffanoff's great bald head. His dark eyes
  moved shiftily.</p>

  <p>"Sire," he stammered. "If you will allow me to explain."</p>

  <p>"No explanations," the King thundered. "These are your marionettes, but
  your's the cunning hand that pulls the strings. Come with me to Merum."</p>

  <p>Staffanoff cringed and fawned. The King crossed the room and rang the
  bell. A moment later the room was filled with armed men. With a contemptuous
  gesture the King indicated his unhappy councillors.</p>

  <p>"Take them all save Staffanoff," he commanded. "They are prisoners, and
  shall be treated as such. They are not to see anyone except the gaolers. Now
  go."</p>

  <p>The room was empty presently save for the King and Oldaker and Staffanoff.
  The latter stood there with bent shoulders and a frame shaking like a
  leaf.</p>

  <p>"I am an old man, sire," he groaned. "A very old man, your
  Majesty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As if that is any excuse," the King cried. "You are coming with me to
  Merum, and in my presence you shall tell your fellow conspirators the story
  of this fiasco. You have room for another passenger, Mr. Oldaker?"</p>

  <p>"More if necessary, sir," Oldaker said, "But one of the sort is
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Good. Then follow me in the grounds, Staffanoff. Wrap yourself up well
  for the journey that is by no means a warm one. Here, my friend. You are no
  longer puzzled. Get in."</p>

  <p>Staffanoff stood there in the darkness shaking with terror.</p>

  <p>"But it is madness, your Majesty," he protested. "I am an old
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And therefore you should not mind, Staffanoff. It is madness like this
  that has saved Asturia to-night. Come, get in, unless you would he gagged and
  bound first. Get in, I say."</p>

  <p>It was nearly two hours later, and the scene had shifted to Merum again.
  There was the council chamber, another little knot of conspirators gathered
  round the table. The King took the hoary old traitor by the shoulders and
  sent him spinning into the room. A hoarse cry came from the table.</p>

  <p>"Staffanoff," the leader muttered. "How did you get here? The King is on
  his way to Marenna. It is impossible for him to reach there before, well,
  before it is too late. Is there anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is wrong," Staffanoff stammered. "The King has been to
  Marenna&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the man is mad," another cried. "Three hours ago the King was here.
  He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I am speaking the truth," Staffanoff shrieked. "Gentlemen, we
  have failed."</p>

  <p>"Failed, then in that case the treaty with Teutonia&mdash;" The speaker
  broke off abruptly, his jaw dropped. For the King was in the room with eyes
  turned with contempt and yet full of cynical mirth upon him.</p>

  <p>"Tell him where the treaty with Teutonia is, Staffanoff," he mocked.</p>

  <p>"Hanging in tatters round Lipski's neck," Staffanoff whined. "And Lipski
  is in the hands of the mob in the street who mocked and jeered him. All
  Europe will be laughing at us to-morrow. They will make us into a vaudeville
  for the comedy stage. Lipski as the chief clown of the piece and the rest of
  us will be low comedians. The King was there. The King threw him out of the
  window to the mob below. And, heavens, how they laughed! And the rest of them
  are all under lock and key."</p>

  <p>A quivering silence followed. There was that in Staffanoff's face, and the
  palsy of his voice that carried conviction to the most cynical spirit there.
  Not so long ago they had seen the King on his way to Marenna; at the earliest
  possible time he could not reach the capital before daylight. And yet he had
  been there and back again. What unknown force had he called to his aid.
  Oldaker could have told them, but there was no one there who associated the
  silent Englishman with this miracle.</p>

  <p>The faint grey dawn was breaking in the east as Oldaker stood alone with
  the King. Something in the way of a belated supper was waiting for him in a
  private room. The King raised his glass.</p>

  <p>"Here's to our friend. Oldaker, the saviour of Asturia," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot make that claim your Majesty," Oldaker said
  modestly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you can. Without you and your Grey Bat I should have been
  powerless. Here's to the Grey Bat, the most wonderful aeroplane that was ever
  made by man&mdash;the Grey Bat that flew in the dark and never made the
  semblance of a mistake. The gallant little craft is safely housed again? And
  we can trust our faithful allies to keep the secret. Good again. A fine
  night's work, Oldaker, and an adventure after my own heart&mdash;and yours.
  And here's to dear little Elizabeth who suggested the whole scheme. And may
  you be as happy with her as you desire. Did I hear the telephone?"</p>

  <p>A servant came in with a message for Oldaker. He was wanted by Marenna.
  The sun was shining brightly and the birds were singing as Oldaker crossed
  the hall.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick?" a sweet voice asked.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," Oldaker responded. "Well, then Betty. My Betty! You are well
  and safe?"</p>

  <p>"I am well and safe," the sweet voice said. "I want to tell you that I
  shall be waiting in the Palace Gardens this afternoon to see you,
  and&mdash;and, oh, my dear, my dear&mdash;"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY CHARLES CROMBIE</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLIV, Aug 1916, pp
  337-343</h3>

  <p class="first">WILFRED BARNES, eke of London University,M.D., looked
  despairingly out to sea. He was seated on the edge of a rotten verandah of a
  tumble-down bungalow on the margin of the Coral Sea down there, in the South
  Pacific, on the outer fringe of civilisation. In front of him was a stretch
  of white sand, with the whiter surf beyond, creamy and mantling in the
  sunshine, and behind him the swaying plumes of the palms, or, at least, they
  would have been the swaying plumes of the palms but for the fact that the
  little islet of Omolo lay in the centre of the anti-cyclone, and not a breath
  of air came to Barnes's almost atrophied lungs. He could feel the
  perspiration trickling down his forehead as he sat there cursing his fate and
  the imps of chance that had brought him all the way from London and Janet
  Blyth.</p>

  <p>It was not his fault entirely. He had put his little capital into a
  practice largely built on bogus ledgers and apocryphal patients, so that, at
  the end of a year, instead of a comfortable living, with Janet by his side,
  he had found himself on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>When everything was disposed of, he found himself facing the world with a
  five-pound note, and looking a black future squarely into its forbidding
  eyes. Then, in a fit of despair, he had sold himself to Mark Gride, the
  eminent pathologist, for three thousand pounds. With the money went Barnes
  into practically three years' penal servitude, though he had not grasped it
  at the time. He had talked the matter over with Janet, and it had seemed to
  her that the opening was a good one. It meant, of course, three years'
  separation, with fifteen thousand miles of sea between them; but then Wilfred
  would be able to save every penny of the money, and, when he came back, be in
  a position to buy another practice more promising than the first one. And so
  Barnes had set his teeth grimly and come all that way to a little island on
  the edge of the Solomon Group, with the firm determination to make the best
  of things; and here he was, at the end of the first year, cursing his bonds
  and wishing, from the bottom of his heart, that Fate had never brought him in
  contact with the cold-blooded brute and unfeeling savage who was known to men
  as Mark Gride. Far better had he stayed in England and accepted a job as
  <i>locum</i> to some sixpenny doctor in the East End of London. And he had
  known something of Gride's reputation, too. The man in question had had a
  brilliant career at Cambridge and University College, where he had towered
  over his fellows like the intellectual giant that he undoubtedly was. But
  then he was ill-disciplined, intolerant, and brutal in his manner, and so
  callous in his methods as to bring him, in the course of time, before the
  Council of the College of Surgeons. There had been a pretty big scandal over
  some vivisection atrocities, and it was only Gride's amazing record that had
  saved him from professional disgrace. Fortunately for him, he was the
  possessor of ample private means, a mad enthusiast as far as his profession
  was concerned, a daring experimentalist and pioneer, and so it came about
  that he shook the dust of London from his feet and migrated to a region where
  he would be able to pursue his investigations in an atmosphere of greater
  freedom and less responsibility. And when he had offered the post of
  assistant to Barnes, the latter had jumped at the offer immediately.</p>

  <p>The conditions were pretty stringent, too, though the pay was good enough.
  Barnes was to have three thousand pounds for three years' services, the money
  to be paid in one sum at the termination of the contract. If in the meantime
  Barnes decided to cancel the agreement, then he was to get nothing except his
  passage home. And if in the meantime anything happened to Gride, then the
  whole of the money was to be payable at once through the latter's solicitors
  in London, who had the necessary authority to deal with the case.</p>

  <p>And then there followed for Barnes a year of hideous nightmare that racked
  his soul and filled him with the lust for slaughter a dozen times a day. For
  out there, in Omolo, Gride could do as he liked. He had his menagerie of
  beasts and reptiles, monkeys and the like, upon which he experimented with a
  cold-blooded malignity that amounted almost to mania. Indeed, in a fashion,
  the man was mad. He had no fear of the College of Surgeons before his eyes
  out there, and he seemed to revel in a refined cruelty which might possibly
  have been accounted for by the fact that between his spells of scientific
  research he had heavy bouts of drinking that brought him frequently to the
  verge of <i>delirium tremens</i>. The year was passing in a review before
  Barnes's eyes as he sat there, wondering if it was possible for flesh and
  blood to stand it any longer. A score of times he had made up his mind to
  quit the whole thing and return home without being a penny the better for all
  he had done. And then the vision of Janet would rise before his eyes, and he
  would grip his teeth and string himself to go on to the bitter end. Even then
  he probably might not have done so, had it not been for Denton.</p>

  <p>This Denton was a cheery American naturalist attached to Columbia
  University, who was out there, in Omolo, studying the local butterflies.
  Perhaps he hated Gride as much as did Barnes, but his philosophy was a little
  wider than that of the Englishman; and, besides, the American was not called
  upon to take any part in those mumbo-jumbo rights and sacrifices of blood
  that Gride's seared and blackened soul revelled in. Still, he was a tonic to
  Barnes, and a sympathetic companion who kept him going from day to day.</p>

  <p>He came on to the balcony now with a glorious puple-and-gold butterfly on
  the palm of his hand. It was a new and rare specimen, and his shrewd grey
  eyes twinkled as he contemplated it.</p>

  <p>"Well, how are we getting on?" he asked cheerfully. "How's old Moloch this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Infernally bad," Barnes said moodily. "He hasn't been sober for the last
  three days, though signs are not wanting that he is coming round. I've had a
  ghastly week, old chap&mdash;perfectly ghastly&mdash;an orgy of blood and
  cruelty that has made my very soul retch. And not a pennyworth of ansesthetic
  on the island, except the morphia that Gride uses to soothe his nerves after
  one of his outbreaks. I wouldn't mind if there were, but when I see those
  poor brutes&mdash;I tell you, Denton, I'm an infernal scoundrel to go on with
  it! And yet what can I do? I have sold myself for a price, and. Heaven knows,
  I am earning every penny of the money!"</p>

  <p>As Barnes spoke, Denton jerked his thumb significantly over his shoulder,
  and a moment later Gride appeared. He was shivering from head to foot in
  spite of the heat, his strong, intellectual face was green and ghastly, his
  chin was dingy with a five days' beard. And yet, though he was racked and
  broken by the brandy he had been drinking, the man's mind was clear and
  vigorous enough, and his great, strong will was dominating his tortured
  body.</p>

  <p>"You were talking about me," he said suspiciously. "Oh, I can guess what
  Barnes has been saying. Let him grumble as much as he likes, I've got him all
  right. He is a sort of Jacob serving for Rachel. Ha! Ha! Go in the house and
  mix me a 30 injection of morphia. We are going to be busy to-night, Barnes.
  You had better clear out, Denton, and don't come here again till I send for
  you."</p>

  <p>"It's a cordial invitation," Denton drawled, "and I shall have much
  pleasure in availing myself of it."</p>

  <p>The American sauntered off with the butterfly in his hand, and the ghastly
  wreck with a five days' beard turned angrily upon his unhappy assistant.</p>

  <p>"You just drop that," he said. "I'm sick of your whining. You are my
  servant."</p>

  <p>"Your slave," Barnes said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps that's a better word. My slave for the next two years to
  come, and don't you forget it. Not that I am complaining about the way you do
  your work. Why, good Heavens, man, there are scores of young doctors who
  would give their heads for a chance like yours! Look what I've taught you!
  Look what you will be able to teach the snivelling sentimentalists in England
  when you get back! And yet you whine and whimper because I put a knife into a
  strapped monkey, without an anaesthetic, as if he were a human being. Look at
  Crim yonder! Is he any the worse for what he has gone through?"</p>

  <p>As Gride spoke, he pointed a trembling forefinger to a chimpanzee perched
  on the edge of the balcony. The monkey seemed to know by some instinct that
  he was under discussion, for he chattered and gibbered and scolded in Gride's
  direction. As a rule. Grim was mild-mannered enough, and for Barnes the
  intelligent beast had quite an affection. But Gride he hated at the bottom of
  his simian soul. He had known what it was to come under the Professor's
  knife, and even at that moment, as he turned, Barnes could see the recent
  stitches of a comparatively new wound between the ape's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't drive Crim too far, if I were you," he said. "Some of these
  days he'll do you a mischief. And he's powerful enough to do so, despite his
  gentleness."</p>

  <p>Gride laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"I've flayed him a score of times," he said. "He'll never do any
  mischief&mdash;he hasn't got pluck enough. And I am not going seriously to
  hurt the best subject I've got. Now go and get me that morphia, and I'll show
  you something presently that no pathologist has ever dreamt of before. I'm
  going to show you a new serum; I am going to show you an absolute certain
  cure for cancer. You know" what I've been doing with that little banana
  monkey Mini. She's full of it. I'm going to cut her throat &mdash;it's the
  only way of doing it&mdash;and then you will be part-discoverer of the
  greatest healing power in the world. And yet people whine and snivel over
  vivisection, and pretend that the whole of humanity had better suffer than
  some furry little beast should be tortured. Then I'll have a shave and a
  bath, and we'll open a case of champagne for dinner. Now, get a move on."</p>

  <p>Barnes came out presently with a hypodermic syringe, and injected the
  morphia into the arm of his chief. In less than a minute Gride was a new man.
  The green tinge left his cheek, the haggard look faded from his eyes, he
  paced up and down the verandah with the air of a man to whom the secrets of
  continents are revealed. Then he went into his own operating-room, and came
  back presently with a tiny monkey in a cage. He had under his arm a small
  leather dressing-case containing a set of razors and the necessary implements
  of shaving. Then, without a word, he took the tiny simian from its cage and
  laid it face upwards on bis knees. With a hand as steady as a rock, he drew
  the edge of the shining blade across the monkey's throat. There was just a
  little gasping cry, with a creepy suggestion of humanity in it, and the tiny
  creature lay dead.</p>

  <p>"Behold, you see there is practically no flow of blood," Gride said, in
  the tones of a man who is demonstrating some everyday problem. "Not more than
  a tablespoonful altogether. But the precious serum is there on the fur, and
  we can easily cultivate from that. Simple, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Horrible, ghastly!" Barnes shuddered. "But look at Crim! Take care of
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>All this time the chimpanzee had been watching the proceedings with an
  intelligence almost weirdly human. He hopped down from his perch and advanced
  towards Gride with hands clenched and eyes aflame with anger. Then his mood
  seemed to change, for be stooped and picked up the razor and ran his paw
  along the edge much as a man might have done who is in the act of shaving. He
  dropped the weapon again, and, with a quick, strangled cry, disappeared in
  the hanging foliage of a palm. Something seemed to grip Barnes by the
  throat.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301051h-images/ASingleHair.jpg"
         title="He advanced towards Gride with eyes aflame.">
  </div><br>

  <p>He stood there, holding himself in hard and sweating from head to foot
  with the nausea and horror of it. Not that it was anything fresh, but there
  were moments of high nervous tension, one little episode piled upon another,
  till it seemed to him that he could stand it no longer. He saw Gride stoop,
  and with a surgical knife cut the little blood-stained patch of hair from the
  dead monkey's throat, and place it carefully in a tin specimen case, which he
  dropped into the pocket of his filthy dirty linen jacket, together with the
  razor with which the thing had been done.</p>

  <p>To Gride it was nothing, merely a trivial incident in the day's work. He
  lay back in the big basket-chair and half closed his eyes, for the morphia
  had him in its grip now, and the man was worn fine by the need of sleep. He
  could see nothing of the contempt and anger in Barnes's eyes. And yet, had
  Gride been possessed of one touch of humanity, one shred of human feeling,
  then a greater man he might have been. As it was, he was a kind of scientific
  Bismarck, with all that individual's brutal contempt for anything or anybody
  that came between him and the goal of his desire. He had all the massive
  intellectuality, too,, with the spiteful cruelty of a Marat, a highly
  organised machine with as much sensibility and feeling.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes, and muttered something to the effect that he needed
  sleep, and that on no account was he to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>"All right," Barnes said. "And if you die in your sleep, I shall thank God
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it would be a good get out for you," Gride chuckled. "In the
  meantime, go on with your dinner, and don't worry about me. And tell Cosmos I
  want him."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged Kanaka boy who cooked and cleaned and did for the two
  Englishmen emerged from his black hole at the back of the bungalow and stood
  to attention.</p>

  <p>"I am going to sleep for an hour, Cosmos," Gride said. "Don't disturb me
  anyhow. Bring out my shaving glass and the soap and some warm water, and put
  it on the table there, so that I can shave when I wake."</p>

  <p>The Kanaka complied obediently. He placed the tackle by the side of his
  master. He stropped the razor and laid it on the table convenient to Gride's
  hand. The latter might wake up in an hour, or he might sleep there all night,
  as he frequently did after one of his drinking bouts. For the moment he was
  worn out, body and soul. When the fiery spirit reached him, he would drink
  for two or three days at a time, eating nothing and working night and day,
  forced on by driving pressure that he could not resist. In these abnormal
  conditions his brain was at its best and brightest. Then Nature would call a
  halt, and after a dose of the blessed nepenthe he would frequently sleep the
  clock round.</p>

  <p>And these were times that Barnes looked forward to, hours that he had
  entirely to himself to think and dream and plan for the future. He was
  turning matters over in his mind now as he pushed his chair back from the
  dining-room table and lit his pipe. How much longer could he go on like this?
  he wondered. Would it be possible to continue to the end of his servitude? Or
  should he throw up the whole thing and go back to Janet, and tell her that he
  had failed? An hour or so passed; the great full tropical moon crept np over
  the edge of the lagoon and flooded the sweating palm beach with a light as
  bright as day. There was silence everywhere, and not a sound to break it save
  the murmur of the tide on the sand and the hum of insects in the air. Then
  presently Cosmos, in the black hole that he called his kitchen, began to sing
  some weird Kanaka song, and Barnes was glad, for there was something near and
  companionable even in the nigger's voice. Then his own storm of black
  thoughts began to drift away, and he stepped out through the open window into
  the flooded glory of the perfect night. How far away from strife and trouble
  it all seemed, how peaceful and attractive!</p>

  <p>Gride still lay there, with his long legs outstretched and his big,
  massive head thrown back against the cushions of his chair. He was in for a
  night's sleep, evidently. Probably he would not wake again till far into the
  next day. He was as still and rigid as the fringe of palms behind the golden
  beach&mdash;almost ominously still, Barnes thought. Some night he would die
  like this, for the man had an aneurism of the heart, and he had always
  declared that, if the trouble gripped him at the same time as he was in the
  midst of one of his drinking bouts, he would go out like the snuff of a
  candle. Almost in a spirit of hopefulness&mdash;an emotion of which he was
  slightly ashamed&mdash;Barnes approached the man who held him in bondage.
  Then he staggered back with a choking cry in his throat.</p>

  <p>It was practically daylight, and every little detail stood out clear-cut
  as a cameo. Gride lay there. Barnes could see his head thrown back, and his
  throat cut from ear to ear. The keen blade had swept through the carotid
  artery and had penetrated almost to the spinal column. The dingy linen jacket
  and the discoloured shirt were stained with blood, already beginning to
  congeal, and from this Barnes judged that his brutal taskmaster had been dead
  an hour or two. A few yards away, on the edge of the verandah, lay a
  bloodstained razor, as if it had been hurriedly thrown down there by the
  assassin in his flight. But for this evidence, Barnes might have concluded
  that Gride had taken his own life; but no man could have inflicted such a
  mortal injury upon himself and at the same time flung the lethal weapon so
  far away. No, beyond a doubt. Gride had been murdered, and Barnes's first
  fierce emotion was one of gladness.</p>

  <p>Then he took a pull at himself, and his reasoning faculties began to
  assert themselves. Who could have done this thing? There were only six people
  on the island altogether&mdash;two inoffensive Kanaka boys besides Cosmos and
  the three Europeans&mdash; and from the moment that dinner had been served,
  Cosmos had not moved a yard from the kitchen. A wild desire for human
  companionship gripped Barnes like a plague. He stepped down from the verandah
  and fled like a hunted thing in the direction of the hut where Denton had
  made his headquarters, and where he gave employment to the other Kanaka boys.
  The American was seated outside his shanty, smoking a green cigar and
  drinking some cool, seductive-looking mixture from a long tumbler by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked. "You look a heap troubled. Sit down and
  have a drink."</p>

  <p>"Gride has been murdered," Barnes said hoarsely. "He went to sleep on the
  verandah instead of coming to dinner&mdash;you know his way&mdash;and when I
  went out just now, I found him with his head almost severed from his
  body."</p>

  <p>"Not much loss, anyway," Denton drawled.</p>

  <p>"Very likely, but that isn't the point. Who could have done it? Not
  Cosmos, I swear."</p>

  <p>"And not my boys, either, for they haven't been outside the hut ever since
  I came back. It seems to lie between you and me, Barnes. I suppose you
  haven't seen red yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see red every day," Barnes said bitterly; "but my hands are clean,
  thank God. I can't think. I am wearied and worn out, and my brain is numb.
  Come over to the bungalow with me, like a good chap, and see what you can
  make of it."</p>

  <p>But it was very little that the American had to suggest. They carried the
  dead man into his room and covered him over with a sheet, and then Denton
  began to ask questions.</p>

  <p>"Tell me everything," he said, "and don't omit any detail, however small.
  There aren't many details in a case like this, and, if you don't mind, I'll
  take this razor home with me. I should like to put it under my microscope,
  and don't you forget that I am some naturalist as well as a collector of
  butterflies, and I know as much about this amazing household of yours as you
  do yourself. Now, there's only one thing for it. You go quietly off to bed
  and sleep, if you can, and I'll come and talk it over with you in the
  morning, and if you take my advice, you'll have a few grains of morphia
  yourself. If ever I saw anybody who needs a drug, you are the hairpin in
  question."</p>

  <p>It was about eleven the following morning when Denton lounged up to the
  bungalow, cool and collected as usual, with a smile on his face and a general
  suggestion of being master of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Well," Barnes said wearily&mdash;"well?"</p>

  <p>"I think I've got it," Denton said. "I worried it all out last night, and
  I found something on the handle of that razor that confirms my suspicions.
  Where's Crim?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how do I know? And what on earth has the chimpanzee got to do with
  it? As a matter of fact, I haven't seen him this morning."</p>

  <p>"Now, you just come with me and bring a gun. When we have found Crim, I'll
  go on with the story."</p>

  <p>Since the previous evening the chimpanzee had not been seen. He had not
  even come in for his breakfast. They found him presently high up in the
  centre of a clump of cocoa-nut palms, from which he nodded and chattered and
  showed his teeth in defiance. He seemed to be filled with a rage and terror
  that was quite foreign to his usual friendly and peaceful demeanour. Without
  a word, Denton raised his gun and shot the simian clean through the
  heart.</p>

  <p>"That's as good as murder!" Barnes cried, aghast. "What did you do that
  cold-blooded thing for?"</p>

  <p>"Waal, I guess we couldn't haul Crim up before a court of justice," Denton
  said. "We couldn't bring him before a jury and the rest of the fixings. In
  these parts, when you meet a murderer, you just shoot him. It's
  rough-and-ready justice, but it's just as effective. And I shot your
  chimpanzee, because he it was who murdered Gride. Not that I care anything
  about Gride, but when an animal takes to that kind of thing, he never stops.
  Now, look here, sonny, it's like this. When you told me all those details
  last night, I began to see my way. To a certain extent I was rather fond of
  Crim&mdash;he was as near a human as makes no matter, and he hated Gride
  almost as much as you did. Look how the poor brute had suffered at the hands
  of that cold-blooded piece of human machinery. Look at the times he has been
  operated upon without an anassthetic, and him big and strong enough to
  strangle Gride as easy as I can stick a pin through a butterfly. I tell you,
  Crim was waiting his chance. Didn't he see the little banana monkey have its
  throat cut? And wasn't everything ready to his hand when Gride went to sleep
  on the balcony last night? Why, it was as if that chap had been giving Crim
  an object-lesson. And Crim took advantage of it. He watched Gride till he
  went to sleep, and then he took the razor and cut the throat of the man that
  he had hated and feared and loathed more than anything that crawled on earth.
  And he had his revenge all right."</p>

  <p>"Seems almost incredible," Barnes said. "But how are you going to prove
  it?"</p>

  <p>Denton took an envelope from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I told you I was a naturalist," he said. "Anyway, I've studied the habits
  of the simian, and I know what he's capable of. Besides, I took that razor
  home last night for a purpose, and in the haft I found what I expected to
  find&mdash;a few hairs, which I have examined under the microscope. And those
  hairs came from Crim, beyond the shadow of a doubt. And I think that ought to
  satisfy you, as well as it satisfies me. At any rate, you are free now, and
  if any man ever earned his money, that man's name is Wilfred Barnes."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY G.C. WILMSHURST</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLIV, Sep 1916, pp
  383-390</h3><br>

  <p class="first">IT was a beautiful prison in which Angela Patton lived, but
  it was a prison, all the same. Not that she had done anything wrong, from the
  point of view of the Draconian creed, but, to begin with, she was alone and
  friendless in the world, a slim, little, somewhat fragile creature, with the
  heart of a poet and the mind of a child who has yet learnt something in the
  hard school of adversity. She knew the bitterness of the bread of charity,
  and though the bread that she ate now was thin and white and exquisitely
  buttered, it was as if it had been dipped in the waters of Marah and
  flavoured with servitude.</p>

  <p>She was fair enough, and sweet in her own dainty way, with a pleasant
  smile and a wistful glance in those grey eyes of hers, so that the young man
  who came from the library occasionally to change Sir John Osborne's books,
  and who had an artistic mind of his own, compared her to the Huguenot maiden
  in Millais' famous picture&mdash;in which the young man from the bookshop was
  entirely right, and wiser than he knew. For the rest, she was discreet and
  sane in her maidenly way, and those deep grey eyes of hers were pensive and
  thoughtful and full of a quiet intellectuality, that touch of soul which was
  one of her greatest charms. In happier circumstances she would have been
  beloved and popular, and, perhaps, when the good fairy came along, she was
  marked out to be the happy mother of children and the helpmeet of some good
  man, who would have loved her, and never been conscious of the fact that she
  was growing old.</p>

  <p>As it was, she was a girl who had been educated, ever since she could
  recollect, in a big institution devoted to the orphans of artists and
  literary people and other improvidents who take no heed of the morrow, and
  are content to gather their rosebuds as they blossom casually by the
  roadside. For Angela had lost her parents many, many years ago, and of them
  she had only the dimmest recollection. There had been a little mother with
  blue eyes and a mass of golden hair, and a tall man with a brown beard, who
  made everybody laugh, and whom everybody liked, even the tradesmen who waited
  upon his doorstep in vain for the promised cheque that never came. But all
  this was a tangled mass of recollection, like a half-waking dream in the
  early sunlight of a summer morning. And now Angela was secretary and
  amanuensis to a selfish old valetudinarian, who wrote books that nobody read,
  and sent learned treatises to newspapers that never published them. The work
  was easy enough, for Sir John confined his efforts to two hours in the
  morning, so that Angela had the rest of the day to herself. She had her own
  small suite of rooms, and a servant to wait upon her, so that she was free to
  devote the balance of her time to her own literary work. Some day or other
  she would make a reputation as a writer of short stories, and then she would
  turn her back upon this lonely, dreary London, and take a delightful little
  cottage in the country. That was her dream, the one thing she had to live
  for; but it was a long way off yet, for the acceptances were few and far
  between, and the balance in the savings bank was a long way short of the
  hundred pounds which Angela had decided must be the amount of her capital
  before she cut herself adrift from Queen's Hostel, the old house in Chelsea
  where her employer lived. Meanwhile she was entirely alone in the world, not
  exactly unhappy, for she ived in an atmosphere of her own, but full of those
  vague longings and ambitions that every well-balanced girl in the same
  condition must feel.</p>

  <p>It was a delightful atmosphere, too, a glorious old house hidden away not
  far from the Chelsea Embankment, a house that, in its day, had been famous as
  the twin residence of a man who had writ his name large in history, and whose
  tragedy had inspired many a writer of romance&mdash;a glorious old house,
  with big, rambling rooms with oak panels and painted ceilings, and quaint
  ingle-nooks with the same Jacobean furniture, none of which had been
  disturbed for the past century or two, and in itself represented a fortune.
  As a matter of fact, the Queen's Hostel had originally been two houses thrown
  into one, and now it was two houses again, the exact counterpart of one
  another, and somewhere on the wide landing, with its bedrooms leading from a
  broad gallery, was a panelled frame of a doorway which had once given access
  to the premises which, in the modern phrase, was now merely "next door." And
  it was this world "next door" that interested Angela so deeply, and around
  which she had spun more than one of those delightfnl little fantasies which
  had found their way into print, and which had induced one discerning editor,
  at least, to ask for more.</p>

  <p>Angela had not the least idea who lived next door. She could have found
  out, of course, by consulting "The Post Office Directory," but that prosaic
  proceeding would have taken the romantic flavour out of it altogether. She
  liked to imagine that the white-haired lady next door, with her tall,
  commanding figure and black silks and flashing diamonds, was a French
  marquise of the old nobility, who had come there to hide some secret sorrow,
  and it would have been a terrible thing to have discovered that she was Mrs.
  Smith or Jones, or that she was the widow of some City knight who had made a
  fortune in cheese or butter, because the lady next door looked the part to
  perfection. She was wealthy, beyond the shadow of a doubt, for she had a
  houseful of servants, and a big car or two, in one of which she drove out
  most afternoons. Then there was an extremely nice-looking young man who came
  to the house next door most days, and who occasionally accompanied the
  white-haired lady on her drives. That a deep affection existed between these
  two, Angela had no doubt. She could see that from the way in which the two
  tenderly embraced when they met, and parted, for the young man did not live
  in the house, and occasionally he did not come near for days together. Quite
  half a dozen of Angela's short stories were written around the white-haired
  lady next door. And the romance was heightened by the fact that no other
  visitors called, so far as Angela could see.</p>

  <p>And so it was that the whole thing grew upon the girl. It was the one spot
  of light and romance in her life, the one little link that connected her with
  the great world beyond. And so there gradually grew upon the girl's mind an
  almost overwhelming desire to know the lady next door. This was not idle
  curiosity on Angela's part&mdash; merely the working of the artistic mind in
  its search for the necessary material. Angela knew that the house next door
  was the exact counterpart of the one in which she lived&mdash;she had found
  out that her neighbour had purchased her house, as Sir John had done his,
  just as it stood, with its beautiful furniture and artistic treasures
  intact&mdash;so that she was enabled to visualise in her romantic mind a good
  deal that was going on upon the other side of that piece of panelling. She
  knew, too, that in the large room looking into the quadrangle the lady next
  door had her own sitting-room, in which was a piano, for many an hour had she
  stood on the landing there, listening to the strains of Chopin and
  Mendelssohn and the elder musicians, that came from the other side of the
  oaken barrier. And Angela was filled with a longing desire to see what was
  going on in the world next door. She had a sort of uncanny consciousness that
  her own escape into the golden universe of flowers and sunshine lay that
  way.</p>

  <p>And one sunny afternoon she made a great discovery. The rays of light
  played upon the wall, and it was in these circumstances that Angela found out
  that what she took to be oak panelling was really a sliding door. It was some
  little time before she could get it to work, but she succeeded at last, and
  as the quaint-carved woodwork slipped back in its socket, she found herself
  gazing with wondering eyes into a room beyond.</p>

  <p>It was not a very large room, and had evidently been divided at some
  recent period from the rest. It had all the same charm of age and mellowness
  as the remainder of the house&mdash;a room panelled with oak throughout, the
  walls lined with beautiful velvety soft mezzotints and quaint cabinets of
  blue china, with a square Persian carpet on the floor, and in the centre a
  writing-table, on which stood a photograph in an old silver frame. In one
  corner of the room was a small-model grand piano littered with music, most of
  it in manuscript, faded with age and faintly scented with lavender. It was
  all so beautiful and restful, all so home-like and inviting that, just for
  the moment, Angela forgot that she was a trespasser, and a mere curious
  spectator should have had no business there at all. She stood there,
  forgetful of all this, drinking in the beauty of it eagerly, heedless of the
  fact that she might be discovered at any moment, and then she stole across
  the room and bent eagerly over the photograph. This was so conspicuous and
  arresting that she felt instinctively that it must be something, some
  dominant note which, perhaps, had a bearing on the white-haired lady with the
  sad face. And then Angela forgot everything else in the thrill of a great and
  arresting discovery.</p>

  <p>For the photograph was that of her own mother. She could not have been
  mistaken, because, upstairs in her own bedroom, she had another copy of the
  same picture, the one thing that she had left to remind her of her mother and
  the days which had now become no more than a blurred and occasionally
  tear-stained memory. The photograph was inscribed with the words: "Yours
  affectionately, Angela," and nothing more.</p>

  <p>How long Angela stood gazing down at that picture, she did not know. It
  might have been ten minutes, it might have been an hour. Then she came back
  to herself with a start, and, with tingling cheeks and a flushed face, she
  suddenly realised the enormity of her offence. She closed the panel behind
  her again and fled incontinently to her bedroom, her cheeks ablaze and her
  heart aflame, and tingling from head to foot with all the dread delight of
  one who has made a great discovery.</p>

  <p>For here was romance indeed&mdash;romance warm and palpitating to the
  finger-tips, a charming mystery beyond anything she had ever evolved in that
  nimble little brain of hers. She took out her own photograph of that dead
  mother of hers from her slender store of secret treasures, and any lingering
  doubts she might have had in her mind were set at rest. And then, for days to
  come, she pondered over this strange thing, wondering what the connection
  could be between that misty mother of hers and the sad-faced lady next
  door.</p>

  <p>She was like a child who has wandered into a new and strange world&mdash;a
  world full of tender romance and mystery&mdash;much as if she had been
  another Alice. But though all this was delightful, it led Angela no further.
  Then gradually she found herself entering into the heart of the conspiracy.
  Every spare moment at her disposal was devoted to watching the movements of
  the lady next door. She became acquainted with the stranger's name. She was a
  Mrs. de Courcey, a widow, who was supposed to have had a good deal of trouble
  in her time, and who devoted her large fortune to works of charity. And more
  than once, when Mrs. de Courcey was out, Angela timidly made her way through
  the sliding panel into the mysterious room next door. She must have gone
  there a dozen times at least before the accident happened. She knew now that
  there was a spring attached to the sliding panel, and, when the great
  disaster happened, the panel had been pulled so far back that the spring
  refused to act, and the heroine found herself a prisoner in that delightful
  room, quite in the approved manner of dramatic precedent. In vain she
  struggled, till her finger-tips were sore and her nails were broken. She
  ventured out on to the landing, but a maid in the hall below drove her back
  into the oak-panelled room again, frightened and hunted, half unconscious
  with fear. And there she waited, till at length, almost with a feeling of
  relief, she heard a faint footfall coming up the stairs before the door
  opened again, and the nice-looking young man with the pleasant face entered.
  He stood for a moment with his back to the closed door, startled and
  surprised, and yet with something in his eyes that was almost fear.</p>

  <p>"Who are you," he asked, "and how did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"I-I don't know," Angela stammered. "Of course, I <i>do</i> know, but it's
  so difficult to explain. You see, I live next door. I am Sir John Osborne's
  secretary, and he dictates all his work to me. And I&mdash;I wrote stories in
  my spare time. The old house appeals to me, and I have thought about it till
  I have come to live in a sort of romance of my own. And I wanted to know Mrs.
  de Courcey so badly. She looks so kind and gentle, and I haven't a friend in
  the world. But that's not explaining. I discovered a few days ago, when I
  stood on the landing, that what I thought was panelling was really a sliding
  door leading from one house to the other, and I tried to see if I could open
  it. I did open it, and found myself in here."</p>

  <p>Angela paused, with the colour flaming in her cheeks. She was conscious of
  a desire to suppress the whole truth. The pleasant-faced young man smiled
  with an imp of mischief dancing in his dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"To-day, you mean, I suppose?" he asked. "Well, no," Angela faltered. "To
  be quite truthful, I have been here several times. I come when Mrs. de
  Courcey is out. And I didn't realise what a shameful thing I have been doing
  till you came into the room. Do you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," the young man said. "When you look at me like that, I
  must believe anything you say. And, after all, there is no harm done. And I
  want you to regard me as your friend. I want you to tell me everything. For
  instance, has that photograph standing on the table anything to do with your
  visits?"</p>

  <p>Here was the touch of romance again, here was the hero who had placed his
  finger unerringly on the very heart of the mystery. Angela felt herself
  expanding like a flower.</p>

  <p>"How did you guess that?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Surely you must be aware of the extraordinary likeness between yourself
  and that photograph," the young man said. "If you were dressed in the same
  way, and your hair was, done in the same fashion, you might pass for the
  original. And that's why you startled me so much when I came into the room.
  And I suppose you don't know that this room is a shrine, and that photograph
  there stands on an altar. But of course you don't. Perhaps I had better
  explain. Mrs. de Courcey is a distant relative of mine&mdash;in fact, she
  believes that I am her only relative in the world. She is very rich and
  kind-hearted and charitable, as I know, because she honours me with the
  spending of all her money. Some day it will come to me as a sacred trust, and
  I think I shall know what to do with it. You see, I happen to have money of
  my own, and therefore I have no ulterior motives. But when I knew Mrs. de
  Courcey first&mdash;twenty-five years ago&mdash;she was very different to
  what she is now. She was a woman in the pride of her beauty, witty and
  accomplished and much sought after&mdash;proud, too, as proud as a Lucifer.
  She married a man older than herself, and from him she inherited her fortune.
  He died in the course of a year or two, and left my relative with an only
  child, a daughter. It seems strange that I should be telling you these
  things, after I have only known you for a few minutes, but you will see
  presently how necessary it all is."</p>

  <p>"I think I see it now," Angela murmured. "I am beginning to comprehend.
  And presently I will try and make you understand that I am not what you take
  me to be."</p>

  <p>"I don't," the young man said, with a whimsical smile. "I want you to know
  how delightful and charming the whole thing is, and how glad I am to meet you
  in this unconventional fashion. It is the most charming story in the world!
  And to think that, if it had not been for the accident to that panel, we
  might never have met! Let me confess I know something about you. I have seen
  you going in and out of the house next door, and, being a young man
  of&mdash;er &mdash;susceptible temperament, I made a few inquiries. I know
  the sort of life you must lead with that selfish old beast Osborne. But I had
  never before met you face to face. If I had, I should certainly have stopped
  you, at the risk of giving offence, and asking you if you were any relation
  to the artist who was known as Giles Patton." "He was my father!" Angela'
  cried. "I knew it. I knew it directly I saw you standing there, like a
  beautiful picture in an old oak frame. And I knew, too, that my gracious lady
  downstairs had found what she has been praying for in this sanctuary of hers
  any time in the last twenty years. It seems almost like a sacrilege for us to
  be standing here, like two figures in a modern comedy, in a shrine which is
  devoted to tears and penitence. And now, my dear Angela &mdash;your mother's
  name was Angela&mdash;cannot you guess the name and identity of the lady who
  rules this house, or shall I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Angela cried, "don't spoil it like that! I have dreamt some
  beautiful dreams in my time&mdash;dreams which I have in vain tried to put
  down on cold paper, but they never satisfy me afterwards. Let me tell you.
  That photograph is my mother's, beyond all doubt. I have one, too, in my
  bedroom, and more than once I have compared them. And now I know that Mrs. de
  Courcey is my grandmother."</p>

  <p>"Of course. No other conclusion could be possible. There could be no other
  ending to a romance like this. Won't you sit down? You have a right in this
  sanctuary, if anybody has."</p>

  <p>Angela was thankful enough' to drop into a chair, for she was trembling
  from head to foot with the surprise and joy and happiness of the moment, and
  the whole world was swaying unsteadily about her. Two unshed tears stood in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are very, very good to me," she said, "and I am not used to it. You
  don't know what it is to find a friend when you have lived all your life
  amongst strangers, who regard you as a mere unit in a garden of children.
  For, you see, my mother died when I was very small, and my father followed
  her very soon afterwards. And then some artist friends of his managed to get
  me into a school which looks after the orphans of painters and musicians, and
  then I became a mere number. I suppose I was always shy and retiring, so that
  I was forced into a sort of world of my own till the time came when I had to
  get my own living. But, oh, if you only knew how lonely it was! It wasn't
  that the other girls were unkind, but that they did not understand me,
  because they could not enter into my little kingdom. And then, in the
  fullness of time, I came here, where, at any rate, I have a comfortable home
  and a not uncongenial occupation. And I have time on my hands to write my
  little stories and realise my ambition of saving a hundred pounds to take a
  little cottage in the country. I don't know why I tell you all this, except
  because you are so kind and sympathetic, and my heart is calling out for
  friendship."</p>

  <p>The young man broke in hastily. He could see that Angela was on the verge
  of tears, and her frankness touched him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I understand," he said hastily. "Mine was largely a lonely
  youth, too. And now it is my turn to speak again. Your mother met your father
  at an art school, and fell in love with him. Of course, that was long ago, in
  the days when your grandmother was full of family pride and in the zenith of
  her popularity. And when she found out everything, she was furious. She was
  still more furious when Giles Patton ran away with your mother and married
  her. And from that moment mother and daughter never met. Outwardly, at any
  rate, Mrs. de Courcey did not seem to feel her loss&mdash;she never mentioned
  anything to her dearest friends&mdash;but the wound rankled and festered, and
  went deeper as the years rolled by. For behind that outward coldness Mrs. de
  Courcey dearly loved her only child, and the time came when she fought with
  her pride and conquered it. All too late. When she set out to find your
  mother, it was only to discover that the erring daughter was dead, and that
  the cause of all the mischief was dead, too. Inquiries were made about you,
  but you had been taken away by another Bohemian, who was also dead, and Mrs.
  de Courcey was under the impression that you had eventually disappeared
  somewhere in the wilds of Australia. She spent any amount of money in
  advertising for you, and, no doubt, if an effort had been made to hide you,
  you would have been found; but, as no such thing had happened, it was
  impossible to trace you. The police told us at the time that such was often
  the case. And so Mrs. de Courcey, humbled and chastened, gave up the world,
  and came to live in this quiet street, where I could look after her, and she
  could spend her time and money in helping the very class of people to which
  you belong, or did belong a few minutes ago. And now you must come down and
  see her. She has not been out for a day or two&mdash;in fact, she is confined
  to her room at the present moment. You are not afraid to come, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am horribly afraid," Angela confessed through her tears. "What will she
  think of me when she knows?"</p>

  <p>"She will see that it was the hand of Providence. When you come to think
  of it, it can be nothing else. Now, come along, and make a noble old soul
  happy."</p>

  <p>Angela found herself presently in a big, sunny bedroom on the far side of
  the landing, standing blushing before an armchair, in which the grey-haired
  lady with the sad face was seated. She looked white and frail, but she looked
  whiter still as her eyes fell on the girl's flushed face. She half started to
  rise, and dropped back into her seat again.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean, Edgar?" she asked. "Is there something the matter
  with my eyes, or is this child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, pray be calm," Edgar de Courcey said soothingly. "The most
  extraordinary and amazing thing has happened. I went upstairs just now into
  that sanctum of yours to fetch down the photograph, as you asked me, and what
  should I find there but the original itself. Here is the original as she must
  have looked twenty years ago, staring, as I found her, at her counterpart
  like a beautiful little ghost. Yes, you've guessed it. This is your
  grandchild, Angela Patton."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301051h-images/TheWorldNextDoor.jpg"
         title="This is your grandchild, Angela Patton.">
  </div>

  <p>"Indeed, indeed, I am," Angela said. "Can you ever forgive me? And yet I
  cannot regret the vulgar curiosity that led me into your sitting-room."</p>

  <p>"You had better explain, Edgar," the grey-haired lady said faintly. "I am
  afraid I don't quite understand."</p>

  <p>The young man proceeded to tell his story. He told it well and humorously,
  with artistic little touches that served to check the tears and bring the
  smiles back again to the lips of both listeners. And when he had finished he
  faded quietly and unostentatiously from the room, leaving the two women
  alone, with Angela seated on a stool at her grandmother's knee, and the slim,
  white, faded hand, with its flashing diamonds, resting tenderly on the girl's
  sunny hair.</p>

  <p>"It is all so wonderful," Mrs. de Courcey murmured, "that I can hardly
  believe it. All these years I have been praying for a miracle something like
  this&mdash;praying in the illogical way that woman does, and almost despising
  herself in her own heart for her romantic folly. And yet I knew that you were
  in the world somewhere. I knew that you would come back to me, and give me
  back some of my lost youth and the happiness that I deliberately shattered,
  if only my penitence were deep and sincere enough. And Heaven only knows how
  deep and sincere it has been. It was my pride that held me back&mdash;a pride
  that I look back upon now with horror. It is the coldest thing that a woman
  can hug to her heart, and well I know it. But I won't say any more about it
  now. I can guess what sort of a youth yours has been, and it shall be my task
  to wipe out the recollection of it. You must come to me at once&mdash;you
  must tell your employer that my need is greater than his&mdash;then we will
  go off to a delightful house of mine in the country that I am longing for,
  and where I never go, because your mother was born there, and there her
  happiest days were spent. And we will take Edgar with us&mdash;Edgar, the
  good and kind, whom I cannot do without. And perhaps, later on, when you come
  to know him better "</p>

  <p>Angela smiled behind her blushes. And, when the proper time came, it was
  Edgar himself who saw to that.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE lay there with his head on his hands, spent to the world
  and weary to the verge of collapse. He had drifted in, earlier in the
  evening, out of the whirl and flurry of the blizzard, and, though the snow
  had melted from his cap and the bulky fur coat about his shoulders, his heavy
  boots were still caked and white, for the heat of the stove struck upwards,
  and even those in the corner of the saloon playing euchre steamed and stewed
  in the moisture, though their feet were almost frozen as they sat. Outside, a
  white world tossed and moaned; outside, the gale volleyed and hissed against
  the window-panes, and the reeling world trembled and staggered before the
  force of the storm. Beyond the saloon was a clump of pines, that bent and
  tossed before the stress of it all, and groaned and shivered like human
  bodies in agony. For the time, at least, the little mining camp on the Ekon
  River was wiped out, everything was at a standstill, and the miners gathered
  in the saloon, driven there for warmth and company, had taken their lives in
  their hands in crossing the shoulder of the bluff that lay not a quarter of a
  mile away.</p>

  <p>There were, perhaps, twenty-five of them altogether, rough and uncouth men
  gathered from all parts of the world in search of the grinning little yellow
  god for whom they were all prepared to pledge their souls. In the vernacular,
  it was a pretty tough crowd, and, for the most part, every man there was
  content to hide his name under some modest pseudonym. There were Jakes and
  Bills and Broncho Charlies, full of rough friendship for one another, and yet
  each prepared to cut the other's throat cheerfully for the sake of that same
  grinning little yellow god that sets men mad and fires all the worst
  instincts that beset poor humanity.</p>

  <p>But for the time being, at any rate, the fitful fever of the chase had
  faded out of men's minds, and they were huddled together there in the saloon
  for warmth and sporting companionship, like so many wild beasts freshly fed
  and watered, and for the moment at peace with all the world. Half a dozen of
  them lounged against the bar, talking and smoking, whilst the rest, poring
  over their greasy and fly-blown cards, were lost to their surroundings in the
  tense excitement of the moment. So it had come about that the tired and
  sodden waif lying there with his head on the table had drifted into the
  saloon without exciting the least curiosity, and without a word of greeting
  from anyone. He had poured a measure of some fiery spirit down his throat, he
  had eaten wolfishly, like one who has fasted to the verge of collapse, then
  he had thrown his head forward upon his hands, and was sleeping now as if the
  end of the world had come, and as if he were no more than a microcosm
  floating in illimitable cosmos. Just now and again a miner flung a glance at
  him over his shoulder, and the bar-keeper smiled carelessly. No one wanted to
  disturb him&mdash;every man had been through the same thing himself more than
  once&mdash;and if the sleeper had a story to tell, then they would hear it
  all in good time. And so he slept and slept while the gale roared outside and
  the pines tossed like things in pain.</p>

  <p>Then the door of the saloon opened again with a flurry of snow and a keen,
  icy draught that set the stinking kerosene lamps dancing, and three other men
  entered. They glanced carelessly about the room through the low, drifting
  smoke for some point where they might rest, for they, too, carried the marks
  of the storm, and for the most part seemed to be almost as spent and weary as
  the sodden fur-clad figure lying there with his head on the table. And it was
  to this table they drifted eventually, and sat down and were calling for
  drinks, which were brought to them, and paid for by the big man with the
  clean-shaven, hatchet face and the keen black eyes. The big man had come in
  with a smaller man by his side&mdash;a smaller man who walked close by him,
  so that their coat-sleeves seemed to touch&mdash;and a close observer might
  have observed that there was reason for this, inasmuch as a link of steel
  bound one left wrist to the right of the other. Still, there was no
  ostentation about this connection, and apparently the big man with the
  glittering eyes was doing his best to shield the fact from general
  observation. The third individual slouched behind the other two, looking
  repugnant and truculent enough, though his eyelids drooped ever and anon, and
  there was a nervous grin on his lips that bespoke a mind none too much at
  ease. Had a novelist who knew the ropes been present, he would have said that
  here was the sheriff in possession of a prisoner, and that the third man
  making up the group was the informant who had brought the arrest about, in
  which the novelist would have been entirely correct, for the Sheriff, Michel
  Thornton, had just arrested George Setro for the murder of Jim Cuddis, and
  the man with the shifty eyes stood as King's evidence. And Setro, as he
  dropped into his chair opposite the slumbering man, knew that his shrift was
  short, and that, unless a miracle happened, rude justice would be dealt him
  before daylight, and his place in the cosmic scheme know him no more. All of
  which was mighty hard upon Setro, for the man was innocent, black as the
  evidence was against him, and he was fighting hard for his life.</p>

  <p>It was quite characteristic of that rough-and-ready locality that sheriff
  and prisoner and leading evidence for the prosecution should sit round the
  table and drink together much as if they were partners in some lawful
  enterprise. And as they sat they chatted, more or less in a friendly manner,
  taking no heed of the sodden stranger who snored upon the table. And as to
  the rest of the men gathered there, they hardly glanced up from their cards,
  and the new-comers were forgotten.</p>

  <p>"What's the next move?" the prisoner asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>He put the question carelessly, but he was far from feeling as indifferent
  as he appeared. Characteristically enough, he had no emotion of animosity
  against the man to whom he was linked by that slender steel chain. All the
  rage and fear and anger that boiled within him were kept for the other man
  with the uneasy grin, who had talked glibly enough as they had come along on
  that perilous journey through the snow, for Setro, the Englishman, had an
  uneasy sort of feeling that it was this third man who had brought about all
  the trouble. But for the moment, at any rate, he took a pull at himself as he
  turned eagerly to Thornton, the Sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Waal, I hardly know," Thornton drawled. "You see, it all depends. Stands
  to reason as it is my duty to take you down to Carton City. But to get there,
  we've got to pass through the Gulch, and if the boys there take matters in
  their own hands&mdash;waal, I guess they'll save the State the trouble of
  putting you on trial. Because, you see, Jim Cuddis, he was some popular down
  there in the Gulch, and the boys are annoyed with you, Setro, and they ain't
  making no secret of the fact. So I calculate that they'll take matters in
  their own hands."</p>

  <p>The prisoner was grimly of the same opinion. And the worst of it was that
  appearances were dead against him. For a year or more he and Cuddis had been
  partners up yonder on the snow-line, where they had lived, almost apart from
  the rest of humanity, working their successful claim, and merely going down
  to the Gulch from time to time in search of provisions. In that inclement
  region for long periods together the partners were cut off from the rest of
  the world by the ramparts of the winter snows, and when, in the early spring,
  the first break had come, the man with the shifty eyes had gone up into the
  hills to see Cuddis on business.</p>

  <p>He had come back at the end of a month or two with a strange story. He had
  found the miners' shack deserted, and no sign of Cuddis or Setro to be seen,
  but he had discovered, half a mile from the hut, the skeleton of a man with a
  bullet-hole in the centre of his forehead, and, from certain bits of evidence
  picked up in the vicinity, he had been forced to the conclusion that this was
  the skeleton of Jim Cuddis, picked clean by the wolves and the birds of prey
  that hovered over the mountains. At the same time there was no trace of Setro
  to be seen, and for many months no man set eyes upon him. Beyond doubt he had
  murdered his partner and gone off East with the heavy burden of gold dust
  which had been cleaned in the claim during the past year or so. And the man
  with the shifty eyes was indignant. He professed to be on intimate terms with
  the murdered man, and, indeed, he was known to have transacted business with
  him on several occasions. According to his story, he had gone up to the
  mountain to meet Cuddis in connection with an investment that the latter was
  contemplating, and in conjunction with which he held the papers, and it was
  this action on the part of the man with the shifty eyes that had led to the
  discovery of the murder.</p>

  <p>The strange part of it was that, knowing his own guilt, and having got
  safely away with the plunder, Setro should have the temerity to return. Very
  likely he had come back for more spoil which he had been forced to leave
  behind him at the time he had committed the crime. The excuse that he had
  gone to England on business in connection with his partner and himself was
  held to be weak and flimsy, and, indeed, the more Sheriff Thornton examined
  it, the more damning did the admission seem, especially as Setro obstinately
  declined to divulge precisely what that business was.</p>

  <p>"Better own up," the man with the shifty eyes suggested. "And there ain't
  much time, for sure. When the boys down at the Gulch lay hands on you
  to-morrow, they won't give you another chance. Let's have it, Setro."</p>

  <p>"You shut up, Philpin!" Setro said savagely. "It isn't as if your hands
  were too clean. It's the truth I'm telling you, Sheriff, whether you believe
  it or not. When I came down from the mountains about a year ago, my partner
  was alive and well, and I thought it was all right till you came and laid
  hands upon me yesterday. I don't care what Philpin says&mdash;he's a
  poisonous skunk, as everybody knows. And I'm not saying he didn't see my
  partner from time to time when I was away, and I'm not saying that he didn't
  put some of his affairs in Philpin's hands. Still, if you give me a chance, I
  can prove that I was in England the best part of last year."</p>

  <p>"There won't be time, sonny," the Sheriff said grimly. "And, besides, that
  don't prove that you didn't bore a hole in your own partner. He must have
  been lying dead there in the snow months before he was found.
  Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Setro shrugged his shoulders helplessly. It would take months to prove the
  truth of his story, and he knew the boys at the Gulch well enough to feel
  that they would not wait as many hours. And, again, what was there to gain by
  betraying the confidence of his old partner? What avail to tell these
  rough-and-ready men that Cuddis had been an Englishman who had left his
  country under a cloud in circumstances that precluded his return, and that he
  had a daughter in England who had just left school, and that he (Setro) had
  gone all those miles to see her and explain exactly how matters stood? Of
  what avail to tell them that he and his partner had been successful beyond
  their wildest dreams, and that he had managed to clear up the trouble at
  home, and had come back to take Cuddis to the Old Country once again? Or that
  a pair of dewy grey eyes had looked into his with something more than
  gratitude in them, and that those grey eyes were drawing him like a magnet
  even at that hour of his deadly peril? So he sat there shrugging his
  shoulders indifferently, with the bitterness of death in his heart, and a
  growing feeling at the back of his brain that the whole thing had been set up
  for him by the man with the shifty eyes, who could have told a good deal more
  if he had pleased, but who was bent upon getting him out of the way; and if
  once this was done, then Stella Cuddis would never see a brass farthing of
  that gold for which the partners had worked so hard. It was all over now, the
  Fates were against him, and it was useless to struggle any longer.</p>

  <p>His mind had suddenly grown vividly tense and clear. He was conscious of
  the acrid smell of the smoke in the saloon, the heavy breathing of the
  gamblers as they bent over their filthy cards, the mingled smell of sour
  humanity and the reek of cheap spirit. And this he saw all the more clearly
  because he knew surely enough that this would be his last outlook on life,
  that had grown all the sweeter and cleaner since his visit to England. As he
  bent forward, he could feel the packet of letters&mdash; those warm,
  affectionate letters from Stella Cuddis&mdash;crackling in his.
  breast-pocket. He found himself, in his heart, envying the sodden wisp of
  humanity lying there with his head on the table, unconscious of the grim
  tragedy that was running its course within a few feet of the straggling grey
  hair fringed round the edge of his battered fur cap. And as Setro looked up
  and caught the nervous grin on Philpin's face, he had a wild desire to reach
  over and batter those repulsive features out of all human semblance. Then the
  Sheriff spoke again. There was no feeling in his speech.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you'd better own up," he said. "The cards are all against you,
  Setro."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" Setro asked. "Well, I don't know. Seems to me that it's
  only Philpin's word against mine."</p>

  <p>"And the evidence," Thornton went on. "Don't you go forgetting that we
  found the body of your partner with a hole in his skull. I ain't denying he'd
  been dead for months, and I ain't sayin' as how he wasn't picked clean by the
  crows and the timber wolves. But there he was, and you'd cleared out without
  sayin' nothin' to a soul. An' you comes back in the same quiet way without
  goin' near the Gulch, an' it's bad, Setro, it's bad."</p>

  <p>"I'm not denying it," Setro said curtly, "and I am not blind to what's
  likely to happen when we get back to the Gulch. But, as I said before, it's
  only Philpin's word against mine. And how long has he had a reputation to be
  proud of? Is there one of the boys would sit down and play a game of cards
  with him? Is there one of them who wonld trust him as far as they could throw
  him? And that's the creature who wants the world to believe that my good old
  partner trusted him, and told him that he was afraid of me!"</p>

  <p>"And so he did," Philpin protested. "Sent for me, he did, in secret, when
  you was down at the Gulch. And what he says to me was this: 'I'm not trustin'
  my partner Setro no longer. He's plannin' to rob me, an', mark my words, one
  night he'll put a bullet into me and skip with the boodle. An' I wants you to
  be my friend, Philpin. I wants you to take all these papers and documents,
  an' act for my relations in case I meet with an accident. There ain't no one
  to know this but myself, an' if I do pass in my checks, an' Setro comes
  along, talking about accidents an' snivellin' over the dear departed, you can
  just confront him with this here letter wot I've written and signed for you,
  an' makin' you my executor.' An' that's wot he says, an' I've got the letter
  to prove it."</p>

  <p>Setro listened calmly enough; he was holding himself in now, conscious of
  the new peril that lay before him.</p>

  <p>"You've got that letter in your pocket?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You bet I have, sonny," Philpin replied.</p>

  <p>"Written by Cuddis himself?"</p>

  <p>"I see him do it. In my presence it were, and handed over to me in the
  exact words wot I told you."</p>

  <p>For the first time since the men had been sitting round the table Setro
  smiled. He was about to speak, when the man seated there with his head on the
  table stirred uneasily, and his right hand lay exposed for a moment before it
  slipped down listlessly to his side. Setro seemed to gurgle in the back of
  his throat, and his whole body twitched convulsively as if something were
  choking him. Then he grew calm again.</p>

  <p>"I am not denying that it sounds convincing," he said. "But if it comes to
  that, let me put it in another way. I told you just now that I went to
  England on business, and that's as true as anything I ever said. And no one
  knew I was going, and why, except my own partner. But you found it out,
  Philpin, and used the knowledge for your own purposes. And you had plenty of
  time to work out your scheme while I was away. I am not accusing you of
  anything yet, but I can make out a case, too, if the Sheriff isn't in a
  hurry, and I don't see how we can leave the saloon before daylight. You went
  up to the shack in the early part of the winter, and you lured poor old
  Cuddis up there over the back of the divide. And you left him there amongst
  the snows&mdash;left him in the cache where we had stored food for distant
  expeditions, left him there treacherously whilst he slept, and got away with
  the dogs and sledges in a snowstorm, so that the trail would be obliterated.
  I say you did all this deliberately, knowing full well that you had abandoned
  a good man and a good friend to certain death, and then you came down to the
  shack. You found Spotted Fox there "</p>

  <p>"Spotted Fox!" Philpin stammered. "Who's he?"</p>

  <p>"The Indian trapper who worked for us from time to time, and helped us in
  the summer. Oh, come, don't tell me you never heard of Spotted Fox!"</p>

  <p>"I seem to sense the name, Setro."</p>

  <p>"Of course you do. Now, what I suggest is this: You shot Spotted Fox
  before you came down to the Gulch, just on the heels of the first big
  snowfall of the year, and the trail was nigh wiped out, and you shot that
  Indian deliberately, knowing that his bare bones would be found after the
  long winter was over, and knowing that the boys would assume that it was the
  skeleton of my old friend and partner, Jim Cuddis. With that idea uppermost
  in your mind, you shot Spotted Fox through the brain, and left him there
  outside the hut, and waited for me to come back again. And all through a long
  winter you had the time to drop your poison by degrees into the ears of the
  boys, and build up your case against me, knowing perfectly well that I should
  come back again. Isn't that true, Sheriff? Hasn't this man been with you
  again and again with scraps of circumstantial evidence against me, and
  stirring up the boys to lynch me as soon as I showed my face in the
  settlement again?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't denying it," Thornton drawled.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Mind you, I'm not bringing this accusation deliberately
  against Philpin, but what I am trying to prove is that a case can be made out
  against him as black as his case against me. After all, it's a pure matter of
  surmise in either respect. And if it comes to clean records in the past, then
  I'll back mine against Philpin's any day."</p>

  <p>"That's so," the Sheriff said impartially.</p>

  <p>"I'm obliged to you," Setro said dryly. "And don't forget that the man who
  accuses me has admitted that he himself found the skeleton of my old partner.
  And he has declared that Cuddis left everything in his hands, and that in
  certain circumstances my partner's wealth belongs to him. And I'm not denying
  that there is plenty of that wealth. We worked hard, and, between us, Cuddis
  and myself must be worth close on a million dollars. My share is in England,
  but most of Cuddis's money is in the bank at Carton City. And this man claims
  that he has the right to deal with every penny of it."</p>

  <p>"So I have," Philpin said parenthetically.</p>

  <p>"The right conferred upon you by a letter written and signed by my
  partner, and handed over by him months ago."</p>

  <p>"You've played the ace," Philpin grinned.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. For the moment I am prepared to admit that the statement
  is true. But now tell me, either of you, what has become of Spotted Fox?
  Where is the Indian who was always hanging around the shack, except for the
  month or two when the snow was frozen hard, and he was out looking after his
  traps? Where has Spotted Fox vanished? What has become of him? He knew the
  country well, he was a man of infinite resource, and no snow or cold had any
  terror for him. He was an honest man, too and gold had no temptation for that
  faithful Indian. Then where is he? What has become of him? Why isn't he here
  to give evidence? I'll tell you. Because he's dead. Because he was shot by
  that yellow-faced scoundrel grinning at me, for the reason I have told you,
  and my dear old partner is lying somewhere up in the mountains, where he was
  treacherously lured to his death by Philpin, and where some day he may be
  found. But not yet&mdash;not yet. Not till I have paid the penalty of a crime
  I never committed, and yonder greasy ruffian has got away with his ill-gotten
  gains beyond the reach of the rightful vengeance of the boys. And there's
  just a chance that Cuddis is not dead at all; there is just a chance there
  was food enough in the cache to keep him alive till the summer, when he may
  return too late to save the gold he has struggled so hard for. And I tell you
  why he has slaved and worked all these years, denying himself everything
  except the mere necessities of life. There's many a good man here has proved
  himself to be a man who dare not show his face where he was bred and
  born."</p>

  <p>"That's so," Thornton said candidly. "I don't mind saying that I'm one of
  them myself."</p>

  <p>"And that is Cuddis's case," Setro went on. "He didn't leave much in
  England behind him that he missed, but he had a child&mdash;a girl of whom he
  was very fond. And nothing was good enough for her. His one idea was to make
  her a lady, and, by Heaven, he did it! It was to see her and explain
  everything that I went to England last year. And when I saw her&mdash;well, I
  could understand my partner's feelings."</p>

  <p>The Sheriff looked up eagerly, scenting romance.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say," he asked, "that you and she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What business is that of anybody's?" Setro asked fiercely. "But it's
  true, all the same. And if you lay violent hands upon me&mdash; Still, it's
  no use talking like this. And I've done. I've got no more to say."</p>

  <p>"Because there ain't nothin' to be said," Philpin sneered. "I've got the
  letter in my pocket&mdash;the letter wot Cuddis give to me when he told me I
  was the best friend he had in the world, and asked me to look after his
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"Written and signed by himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, pard, and in my presence, too."</p>

  <p>"You lie, you dirty dog, you lie!" Setro shouted. "Cuddis never wrote a
  letter in his life. He never learnt to write. He could only read simple
  words. Out of your own mouth you are convicted, you murderous reptile!"</p>

  <p>The man sleeping on the table suddenly raised his head and smiled at
  Thornton.</p>

  <p>"Guess that's true, Sheriff," he said. "I never could write, more shame to
  me. And it seems to me as if you've got that steel bracelet on the wrong
  wrist."</p><br>

     name="story6">6.&mdash;THE LESSON THE ANTS TAUGHT</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY CHARLES CROMBIE</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLV, Dec 1916, pp
  101-107</h3>

  <p class="first">CROSFIELD looked across the camp fire at his friend Norton
  with the light of battle gleaming in his eyes. They were away up there on the
  veldt, not a hundred miles from Kimberley, and the fruits of three years'
  unremitting toil lay in the hollow of Crosfield's hand. To the untutored eye
  they represented no more than half a dozen round stones like big marbles, but
  an expert would have had no difficulty in recognising the fact that those
  pebbles were diamonds of the purest quality&mdash;six bits of glorified glass
  that represented a king's ransom.</p>

  <p>To all practical purposes these were the absolute property of the
  partners, though lawyers and people of that kind learned in the mysteries and
  devious ways of legislation might have held a contrary opinion. At any rate,
  there they were, and between them they represented a fortune of something on
  the outside of a hundred thousand pounds. They represented something more
  than that&mdash;they stood for the entire worldly wealth of those men, they
  stood for three years' unremitting toil and danger, thirty-six sweating,
  blistering months endured under a tropical sun and accompanied by every
  hardship and danger that is known in the vocabulary of the pioneer. Those
  dull stones meant peace and happiness in England, home and friends, and
  everything that those two had set out to win for themselves. And yet there
  was much to be done before Crosfield and Norton found themselves on the high
  seas in search of English woods and meadows and all that life holds most
  dear. Hence the hard glitter in the eyes of the two men, hence the fact that
  they were discussing the future in whispers with the air of conspirators
  against the law.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose they are worth?" Norton asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, there ought to be fifty thousand pounds for us each here,"
  Crosfield replied; "and, by every moral law, these stones belong to us."</p>

  <p>"It isn't moral law we've got against us," Norton said dryly. "You may
  depend upon it that that rascal Blatter won't leave a stone unturned to get
  those diamonds back. He knows by this time that they are in our
  possession&mdash;in fact, he told me so last night. When D'Jin came here and
  sold us our own stones, we ought to have kept him and taken him down to Cape
  Town with us. It is fatal to have paid him before we had booked our
  passages."</p>

  <p>"What's the boy been up to?" Crosfield asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you paid him fifty pounds for smuggling those stones through,
  didn't you&mdash; fifty pounds to a greasy nigger boy who has never
  previously seen a gold coin in his life? And what does D'Jin do? Bought
  himself a couple of wives and a bunch of cattle, and set up as a local
  magnate. Of course, Blatter was on him like a shot. He guessed at once that
  D'Jin had been handling diamonds, and he laid out for that conceited nigger.
  As far as I could gather, D'Jin gave the whole show away, and, when you were
  out after springbok this morning, Blatter came over here, foaming with rage,
  and asked for his stones back."</p>

  <p>"They are our stones right enough," Crosfield said, "and if D'Jin did find
  them, they were on our land."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but Blatter is prepared to swear that when he took this holding off
  our hands, we sold him the patch of blue ground as well. And he has got some
  sort of a map to prove his claim, and he is prepared to swear that the blue
  ground that runs from Hodder's Spruit to Hagfontein is part of his purchase.
  He says he bought all the land that Jan van Beers trekked in 1874, and that
  <i>slim</i>* Dutchman is ready to back him up. There's only one thing to be
  done."</p>

  <p>[* <i>slim</i> (Afrikaans) - bad, nasty, worthless. ]</p>

  <p>Crosfield's lips tightened ominously. They had sunk every penny they had
  there, and it was only quite lately that they had found traces of diamonds on
  that hitherto despised patch of ground of theirs; and this corner of the
  property they had reserved when, sick at heart and in desperate need of
  money, they had sold their holding to the wily Karl Blatter. But that
  <i>slim</i> German had known what he was doing, and he had laid his plans
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>"So that's the game, is it?" Crosfield said, when he had heard everything
  his partner had to say. "Old man, I am not going to fight that fat blackguard
  in the local courts, and I am not going to give up those stones, either. They
  are as much my property and yours as the rifle that I hold in my hand. If we
  made this a legal matter, I can see that we are done. We shall never be able
  to stand up before all those perjured witnesses, and, so far as I can see, we
  have got everything in the way of diamonds that the blue clay yonder is
  likely to yield us. I can see the little place I'm after at home in my mind's
  eye as I sit here now, and you've got a girl over yonder, and I've got a girl
  yonder, and&mdash;well, I needn't say any more."</p>

  <p>Crosfield lighted his pipe and set about preparing the simple mid-day
  meal. But there was danger ahead, and he knew it perfectly well; but the
  knowledge only gave zest to the adventure. And how near that danger was,
  transpired a little later in the afternoon, when the adventurers, sitting
  round their camp fire, were intruded on by a stranger, who came across the
  river riding a useful-looking horse, and who dismounted without further
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>He was a stranger to the partners, a hard, lean, muscular man with grim
  jaw and penetrating grey eyes. From the way he rode, and from the fashion in
  which he carried himself, the partners rightly judged that the stranger had
  seen service.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said. "Maybe you're not knowing who I am? But me name's
  Commissioner Costigan. An' I believe I am talking to Mr. Crosfield and his
  partner?"</p>

  <p>"You've hit it," Crosfield said. "I don't remember ever having had the
  pleasure of seeing Captain Costigan before, but I am pleased to meet. 'The
  Goat' after all these years."</p>

  <p>The stranger threw back his head and laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"Bedad," he said, "an' ye have the advantage of me! I haven't heard that
  name since I was at Eton, twenty-odd years ago. And, now, shure I know you
  both. Wasn't I in the boat with you the year we won that Ladies' Plate at
  Henley? And if me eyes don't deceive me, that's Nobby Norton? Well, well,
  it's a queer old world we live in. And when I was faggin' for you both all
  those years ago, it's little I thought I should ever be out here, chasing
  niggers and hunting round after Old Etonians who had so far forgotten
  themselves as to be robbing a hard-working German&mdash;bad luck to
  him!&mdash;of the fruits of his toil."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the old school-fellows were sitting round the camp
  fire, exchanging reminiscences. Then, as the shadows deepened, the merry
  twinkle died out of the Irishman's eyes, and he grew serious.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen here, boys," he said. "I rode over to-day, knowing that you
  were clean and decent Englishmen, to see if I couldn't put this matter right.
  I suppose you know that I could have brought half a dozen troopers, and have
  had you locked up. Now, I know that one of you has got those diamonds on him,
  and, for your own sake, I am going to ask you to hand them over."</p>

  <p>"We are not denying it," Norton said quietly; "but those stones belong to
  us. You know that Blatter is a blackguard, and that we have been
  swindled."</p>

  <p>"An' who was sayin' you were not?" Costigan demanded. "But I must report
  the matter, and once you are in Cape Colony you will have no 'Goat' to look
  after you. And, mark my words, you will live to be sorry for it."</p>

  <p>"We are going to risk all that," Crosfield said.</p>

  <p>"Very well, me boy, then I won't say any more. Shure, there's no finer
  detective force in the world than the I.D.B. Preventative Force at Cape Town.
  Do you mind Jimmy Forsyth, who was in Caxton's House? Yes, I see you do. And
  a cunninger young devil never got out of an imposition. Well, he took a hand
  in the sport, and to-day he's serving ten years' sentence on the breakwater
  at Cape Town. I know it's hard, but it will be harder still if you try to run
  what you've got in your pockets through the harbour at Cape Town."</p>

  <p>With which Costigan filled his pipe again and began to talk about other
  things. It was getting late now&mdash;so late that Costigan accepted an
  invitation to share the evening meal and a blanket for the night by the camp
  fire. And, as he talked on, Crosfield, opposite him, grew more and more quiet
  and thoughtful, as if he were debating some heavy problem in his mind. He sat
  there gazing into the fire, until presently Norton, who knew his every mood
  and fancy, saw a sudden gleam in his eyes and the faint whimsical smile that
  trembled on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Costigan," he said suddenly, "you were always a good sportsman. Did you
  ever shoot an elephant?"</p>

  <p>"Bedad, I never did," Costigan replied.</p>

  <p>"We've spotted two," Crosfield said. "There's a big rogue of a chap that's
  done a lot of damage here. Now, I've got a couple of elephant guns here and a
  box of shells, and we might have a cut at him. Are you game?"</p>

  <p>"Faith, I never laid hands on an elephant except in kindness," Costigan
  said solemnly; "but I don't mind acting as an umpire. So if you'll put me in
  a comfortable place with a pair of good glasses, it's happy I'll be to oblige
  you."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, then," Crosfield said. "We'll show you a bit of sport,
  and then we'll all go down country together."</p>

  <p>"It's leavin' here you are to-morrow?" Costigan asked.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of staying?" Crosfield retorted. "We've sold our
  property, and the sooner I'm back in England, the better I'll be
  pleased."</p>

  <p>"It's no good, old fellow," the Irishman said solemnly. "Blatter has sold
  his rights in your late property to the Diamond Fields Amalgamated, and
  they'll have your gore, if it costs them a million. There's too much of the
  rich red blood of Israel in that clan for you chaps to butt up against. But
  there&mdash; I've warned you enough already!"</p>

  <p>"We're going through with it, all the same," Crosfield said doggedly.
  "Give me those cartridges, Norton."</p>

  <p>Norton fished out a box of shells and the two elephant guns, and for the
  next quarter of an hour or so Crosfield was busy with a file and a small
  vice, which he attached to a broken bench. He was making dum-dum bullets, he
  explained; he was going to run no risks, so far as that rogue elephant was
  concerned, and, besides, he was just a little doubtful as to the driving
  power behind those German-made explosive bullets.</p>

  <p>"They're all right, as a rule," Crosfield explained, "but occasionally a
  shell fails to explode, and you can't afford that sort of melodrama when you
  are fooling with an African elephant."</p>

  <p>Costigan replied that it was all the same to him, so long as he was
  watching the sport from a safe distance through a pair of glasses, and with
  that the camp fire was made up for the night, and the three men rolled
  themselves up in their blankets. Very soon Costigan's regular breathing
  testified of the fact that he was asleep. Norton turned over and edged
  himself a little nearer to the side of his companion.</p>

  <p>"What's the little game, old man?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"You leave that to me," Crosfield replied. "We are going to the Cape, and
  there were going to stay as long as the authorities care to detain us. But
  they won't find those stones, because they will be hidden where no man on
  earth will ever find them, and you can gamble on that."</p>

  <p>Not another word would Crosfield say. They breakfasted leisurely enough
  the following morning, and, everything being ready, proceeded to call the
  handy Kaffir boy D'Jin into their counsel.</p>

  <p>News had come in that the big rogue had raided a mealie field by the side
  of the waterhole during the night, and he was now resting in a patch of scrub
  half a mile or so on the other side of the stream. This being so, it would be
  no great matter to rouse the big beast and drive him in the direction of the
  scrub.</p>

  <p>"All right," Crosfield said. "You can go and work the beast round to the
  scrub, and dig a pit in front. Do you hear? If anything goes, wrong, he will
  flounder into it, and we shall have him safe. Directly you get a move on, one
  of you boys had better come back and look after the ponies. They'll be on top
  of the knoll yonder. Off you go."</p>

  <p>Crosfield led the way, closely followed by Norton, whom he posted on the
  left, whilst he himself went forward, being the better shot of the two, and
  took up his position upon the far bank of the stream opposite a belt of deep,
  swampy ground that bordered the patch of scrub in which the Kaffir boys
  declared the elephant was lying.</p>

  <p>"Now% you stay here," Crosfield directed, "and wait. If he does break this
  way, you'll be able to stop him, though it's long odds that he will come
  straight across the brush directly he catches sight of me. I suppose
  Costigan's got a good view from the knoll yonder."</p>

  <p>"He ought to be able to see everything, and there is no better pair of
  glasses in the colony than mine."</p>

  <p>Crosfield crept on until he had come to the spot where he intended to take
  up his stand. Already on the far side of the swamp the Kaffir boys were
  moving in the scrub. The noise of their cries came down the wind, and
  Crosfield smiled grimly as he heard them. Then the patch of reeds opposite
  him seemed to move bodily, and a moment later the big elephant loomed in
  sight. He was obviously alarmed and uneasy, for he was trumpeting wildly as
  he came blundering towards the bush, his head up and his big tusks gleaming
  in the sunshine. Then he canght sight of the man standing there, and charged
  down upon him violently.</p>

  <p>Apparently the scrub was less holding than Crosfield had anticipated, for
  it merely served to check the speed of the great pachyderm. He came ambling
  across the brush before Crosfield could get his rifle to his shoulder; then
  the huge beast swerved to one side, and kicked up his enormous legs like some
  colt might have done.</p>

  <p>It was a broadside shot now, and obviously it was up to the marksman to
  get his prey behind the ear. He fired one shot, then another, and another,
  and as Norton heard it he started uneasily. To his trained ear there was
  something wrong, something perilously inadequate in the bursting charge of
  those shells. Three times more did Crosfield fire, and neither shot was
  followed by the clear report that should have gone with a properly-filled
  cartridge. It was obvious, too, that beyond arousing the elephant to a pitch
  of pain and madness, no vital mischief had been done.</p>

  <p>It was up to Norton now to take a hand swore aloud. He was cursing that
  ineffective German ammunition by all his gods. He would have shouted to his
  companion, but already Crosfield had realised the danger.</p>

    <img src="1301051h-images/TheLessonTheAntsTaught1.jpg"
         title="Crosfield had realised the danger.">
  </div><br>

  <p>He dropped his gun and sprinted along the open in Norton's direction as if
  all the fiends from the bottomless pit were after him. At the same time the
  practically uninjured elephant caught sight of his quarry, and charged after
  him through the scrub. Then, just as Norton got in a shell between the two
  wicked little eyes, the big rogue pitched forward and crashed headlong to the
  bottom of the pit that D'Jin and the other boy had so cunningly prepared for
  him. He lay there a huddled mass of flesh, past all mischief now.</p>

         title="The practically uninjured elephant charged through the scrub.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Well, that's the last time I ever use a German cartridge," Crosfield
  exclaimed. "What did you think of it, Costigan?"</p>

  <p>"Be jabers, not much," Costigan grinned, "and it's glad I am that I didn't
  take a hand at the game. What are you going to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Let him lie where he is," Crosfield said. "Of course, we are going to
  give you the tusks as a souvenir of the occasion, and a nice little present,
  too, if you only knew it. Get 'em off, D'Jin. And throw a few boughs and a
  big log or two over the brute's body. If you do the work properly, it'll be
  quite safe as far as any prowling beast of prey is concerned."</p>

  <p>"What's the game, boss?" the grinning D'Jin asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want that skull, at any rate. We are going down south presently,
  and we'll come back for it in a month or two. If you do what I ask you
  properly, the ants will see to the rest. What's that, Costigan? Oh, yes,
  you'd hardly believe it, but within a few weeks there won't be a scrap of
  that elephant left, once the ants get to it. When we come back, the skeleton
  will be polished as white as ivory. And now, then, we'll get down to the Cape
  as soon as D'Jin has finished."</p>

  <p>It was three days later when, still accompanied by Costigan, the two
  friends crossed into Cape Colony by train. They were met on the border by a
  man who gave his name as Buckley, and who informed them, in a curt official
  way, that they could regard themselves as his prisoners on a charge of
  offences committed against the I.D.B. Act; also that in this particular case
  the information had been laid by the representative of the Diamond Fields
  Amalgamated. To which Crosfield listened with a smile on his face, and the
  information that the authorities could do as they pleased. Neither he nor his
  friend had any diamonds about them, nor were they ready to admit that they
  had ever handled anything of the kind. To all of which Buckley listened with
  a twinkle in his eye and a request to know if there was anybody in Cape Town
  who would be likely to come forward and offer bail. Crosfield responded that
  he didn't care, and that, so far as he was concerned, he was not prepared to
  ask favours from anyone.</p>

  <p>For the next few weeks Crosfield and Norton spent their time as guests of
  the Government. They were searched with a thoroughness that allowed no
  loophole for escape, they wrote no letters, and were permitted to receive
  none. And so far no regular charge had been made against them, for the simple
  reason that there was no material evidence to go upon. But they were treated
  well enough, and had nothing to grumble about beyond the loss of their
  liberty.</p>

  <p>It was only after they were released that they realised how thorough the
  search had been, not only as regards their persons, but also as concerned the
  neighbourhood from which they had come, and, indeed, Costigan subsequenUy
  reported that D'Jin had grown thin and haggard under the merciless
  cross-examination to which he had been subjected. But everything comes to an
  end in time, and there came a day when the adventurers were released, and
  were told that they could go where they pleased.</p>

  <p>"Back to where we came from, perhaps?" Crosfield asked the discomfited
  Buckley politely.</p>

  <p>"You can go to the devil, as far as I am concerned," that worried official
  responded. "Let me tell you this. I've been at this game for fifteen years,
  and I've had some bright intellects through my hands, but this is the first
  time I've been badly done. And if ever we meet in England, where you'll be
  safe, I shall be greatly obliged if you will tell me how the thing was
  worked."</p>

  <p>"England's a long way off," Crosfield said. "But if we do meet there,
  perhaps you'll come and dine with Norton and myself at the Oxford and
  Cambridge Club, and then we might find ourselves in a position of greater
  freedom and less responsibility. For the present, good-bye, Buckley."</p>

  <p>Ten days later the two friends were back again within half a mile of the
  spot where they had given their futile exhibition for Costigan's benefit.
  They had ascertained the night before, from the grinning D'Jin, that nothing
  had happened of any importance during the last month or so, and that, so far
  as he knew to the contrary, the body of the elephant was still in the pit
  that he had prepared for it. He was fain to admit that he had not been near
  the place himself, to which characteristic confession Crosfield listened with
  a smile. He dismissed the Kaffir presently, and, with Norton, made his way
  across the bush in the direction of the spot where the skeleton lay. It was
  just as he had expected. The ants had done their work thoroughly enough, and
  down there, in the bottom of the hole under the logs and brushwood, was a
  great gleaming heap of bones picked dry and clear. And Crosfield nodded
  approvingly; his smile was almost irritating to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Now, perhaps, you will tell me what the game is," Norton said. "Why this
  interesting ceremony?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Crosfield smiled, "we have come after our diamonds, which I told
  you were so safely hidden that no man could find them. And so they are. They
  are down there in that hole under that heap of bones. Ants can destroy most
  things, but they, can't eat diamonds. Now, don't stand there staring at me.
  Lend a hand and get all those logs and brushwood away, and help me to remove
  the skeleton. And go gently, because in the dust there the diamonds are
  lying, or we are the two unluckiest chaps in Africa to-day."</p>

  <p>It was all done at length. The bones were carefully removed, and then
  Crosfield, on his hands and knees, began to sift amongst the dust. At the end
  of half an hour he straightened himself up and held out a trembling hand to
  his companion. In his grimy hand lay the six precious stones, the diamonds
  beyond the shadow of a doubt. Norton could do no more than gaze open-mouthed
  at his friend, and wait till the latter explained.</p>

  <p>"It was like this," he said. "When Costigan turned up, I thought we were
  done. I had the diamonds on me, and he knew it. Of course, he played the game
  like the good fellow that he is, but he had his duty to think of, and it was
  a case of his wits against mine. And I knew perfectly well that he was not in
  the least likely to lose sight of us until he had handed us over to Buckley.
  If we had attempted to get away, he would have taken out a warrant for our
  arrest. So the obvious game was to go down to Cape Town and bluff it out. But
  that was no good unless we could save the stones. Then the inspiration came
  to me as the three of us were sitting here round the camp fire. Under
  Costigan's very eyes I extracted part of the bursting charge and shoved the
  diamonds into the cartridge cases in place of the bullets. Everything was in
  our favour&mdash;that bit of brush might have been placed there on purpose.
  So, when the time came, I just fired those stones into the shoulder of our
  four-footed friend and left the rest to chance. My idea was to come back here
  when those chaps yonder had to admit themselves beaten, and pick up the
  stones just as we have done. The odds were a million to one against anybody
  finding them in the meantime. At any rate, I knew those lazy Dutch devils
  wouldn't, and&mdash;well, there you are. There's only one thing now, and
  that's to get home."</p>

  <p>"Not through Cape Town," Norton grinned.</p>

  <p>"Not much," Crosfield said emphatically, "though I don't suppose they'd
  touch us again now if we did go that way. Still, we'd better be on the safe
  side. So I suggest that we make our way across country to Delagoa Bay and
  join a tramp steamer there. Carried unanimously?"</p>

  <p>And there, down in Cape Town, Chief Inspector Buckley is still trying to
  puzzle out the manner in which those diamonds eluded him and found their way
  eventually to Chicago, where they now adorn the white throat of one of the
  greatest heiresses whose father ever made his pile in pork.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY STEVEN SPURRIER</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLV, Dec 1916-May 1917, pp
  393-398</h3>

  <p class="first">HEATHER took the drifting spray that sifted over the table
  like a cloud of mauve butterflies and crushed it ruthlessly in his hand.
  Later on he would realise that those delicate blooms represented a guinea's
  worth of orchids, and that they would certainly figure in his bill, for he
  had ordered a special dinner for two there at "The Majestic," and it was no
  fault of the management that Sir Thomas Salter, the great engineering
  magnate, had failed to keep his appointment. As a matter of fact, he had put
  Heather off at the very last moment by means of a telephone message to the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>There was no help for it&mdash;Heather would have to sit down alone to an
  elaborate menu and the trilogy of extravagant wines, which even now were in
  the wine cooler by his side. Neither did it matter much that George Heather
  had practically his last ten pound note in his pocket. It had been an
  audacious thing on his part to ask the great man to dine with him at all; but
  then Heather was an engineer, and audacity builds many bridges. He had hoped
  to get a snug appointment from the great man, but now it looked as if he
  would have to go back to the Gold Coast and sweat out another five precious
  years of his life amidst the scum of humanity in a reeking atmosphere of
  filth and fever and all the soul-destroying degradation of that forbidding
  climate.</p>

  <p>Well, it didn't matter much&mdash;nothing seemed to matter at that
  particular moment. It was more hard on Kitty than on anybody else&mdash;dear
  little Kit, with whom he had discussed the future so buoyantly in Kensington
  Gardens only an hour or two before. Well, that dream was ended&mdash;for the
  present, at any rate. He would go back to the Gold Coast next week,
  and&mdash; Well, in the meantime he might just as well eat the extravagant
  dinner that he had ordered, and make the best of what the Fates had in store
  for him. Now that the worst was past, he ate his way calmly through the
  elaborate menu until he reached the coffee and the 1820 brandy, and there
  began to steal over him the benign feeling of satisfaction that only a good
  dinner can give.</p>

  <p>He lay back in his chair presently, watching his neighbours with a certain
  hard and cynical amusement. And then presently it seemed to him that a man
  seated by himself a little distance off was regarding him with a close
  attention that was almost flattering.</p>

  <p>The individual in question was beautifully turned out, and had about him
  that faint, indescribable air of prosperity that is implied more than spoken.
  He was a young man&mdash;no older than Heather himself&mdash;though his hair
  was thinning at the top, and there were certain lines about the corner of his
  mouth and round those unsteady eyes of his that told their own tale. A moment
  later the stranger rose from his seat and came in the direction of Heather's
  table. A fine moisture was standing out on his forehead in beads, and the
  hand that held his cigarette was shaking strangely.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to you?" he asked. "Thanks. Waiter, bring me a liqueur
  brandy. Well, I see that you recognise me. You do, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure of that?" Heather asked.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful how small a place the world is," the stranger went on. "Queer
  how often you meet the very last person you expect to see."</p>

  <p>"It is very awkward at times," Heather said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it? Especially when you were quite sure that the other chap
  had been dead and buried for the last two or three months."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you thought I was dead, did you?"</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, I was absolutely sure of it. When I got down to the camp,
  after Brass and Crossley had been done in, I found nothing but the remains of
  your hut, all burnt to a cinder, and your guns all broken and useless. Most
  of your papers were charred beyond recognition, and, besides, that native boy
  of yours told me that the hut had been attacked by the niggers, and that you
  had been shot and thrown into the flames. If it hadn't been for the
  photograph of you and the girl, I might have had my doubts, because, you see,
  I never happen to have met you face to face. But there was that photograph in
  a leather case, and, of course, I had a description of you. You know who I
  am, don't you&mdash;Wilberforce?"</p>

  <p>Heather hesitated just for a moment. He hadn't the remotest notion who
  this man was, but the story had a familiar ring about it. It was a common
  type of story along that awful coast, which Heather knew almost as well as he
  knew Piccadilly. And there was something more behind it&mdash;of that he felt
  certain. Moreover, he had done a certain amount of magazine work himself, and
  here he appeared to have stumbled over the edge of a romance which might be
  well worth the telling. And undoubtedly this man with the shifty eyes and
  moist, clammy skin was telling no more than half the truth. He had the air of
  one who was trying to justify himself in the face of a serious accusation.
  And he, somehow or other, had come into possession of one of those
  photographs of Heather and Kitty which had been taken three years ago by
  Lesterre. Obviously the thing was worth going into.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you are Wilberforce?" he asked. "Really? And you picked up my
  photograph when you got down to the hut that evening?"</p>

  <p>"I did," the other man said. "Directly I got it in my hand I said to
  myself, 'It's Chambers&mdash;Chambers and his girl, beyond the shadow of a
  doubt.' So I put it in my pocket, thinking that perhaps it would be useful
  later on. Of course, I was absolutely certain that you had perished with all
  the rest of them when those traders turned the natives against us and tried
  to rob us of the ivory. Now, how on earth did you manage to get away,
  Chambers?"</p>

  <p>Heather hesitated just for a moment. That there was something sinister
  about this, and that there was more to come, he had not the shadow of a
  doubt. He could see that in the shifty eye and the sinister smile on the
  other man's face. "We will come to that presently," he said. "Meanwhile, it
  doesn't follow that the name you know a man under in Africa is the same under
  which he passes in London. So perhaps you had better address me as
  Heather."</p>

  <p>"I am Wilberforce still, at any rate," the other man said.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you," Heather said dryly, "And what really became of our
  friends Brass and Crossley after I was done with? You are not going to tell
  me that you did not get the ivory through all right?"</p>

  <p>The man called Wilberforce seemed to be swallowing something at the back
  of his throat. His shifty eyes dropped again, and once more that peculiar
  ingratiating and sinister smile creased the corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>"If anyone tells you that I played the dirty on the other chaps, it's a
  lie. I did nothing of the sort. I am not exactly a plaster saint, but&mdash;
  Well, those chaps are dead and gone now, and I can give you no more than my
  bare word. And I don't know that their names really were Brass and Crossley.
  They only knew me as Wilberforce because I said that was my name. As a matter
  of fact, it is; but out yonder, as you know, we are not particular about that
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Heather did know it, and smiled accordingly. Whoever this man was, and
  however credible his tale might be, he was listening to a man who was
  familiar with every inch of the ground they were talking about.</p>

  <p>"But the other fellows had good friends amongst the natives, I suppose?"
  he asked. "For instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are going to speak of Mombassa. I had forgotten Mombassa for the
  moment. I suppose it was that faithful nigger who helped you to get
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you what he told me?" Heather asked. Who Mombassa was, he
  had not the least idea, but he was in the mood to get to the bottom of this
  thing now. "Or perhaps you are not curious to hear?"</p>

  <p>A queer green tinge spread over the other man's face. Then the rusty spur
  of a bankrupt self-respect pricked him, and he spurted into a little spate of
  anger like damp gunpowder fizzling on a hot plate.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," he said, "if you prefer to take the word of a nigger to mine,
  of course&mdash; Don't be annoyed, old chap. My nerves are not what they
  were, and I am doing far too much of that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>He flicked a shaky forefinger in the direction of his liqueur glass, which
  the waiter had already refilled more than once, and the uneasy,
  self-conscions grin was on his face again. He did not, perhaps, know that
  Heather was reading him like an open book, and that he stood before the other
  perfectly self-confessed as a scoundrel who had betrayed his three colleagues
  into the hands of the natives, sent them to their death so that he could get
  off with the spoil And that he had done so was evident by the fact that he
  was dining here, dressed in purple and fine linen, evidently a welcome and
  honoured guest, and obviously a man of means. He was telling Heather plainly
  enough that he had deliberately planned the murder of his comrades, or, at
  the very best, he had stood coldly on one side, and had got away with the
  spoil whilst the other men were fighting for their lives. And there was
  another thing. Who was the man called Chambers, and how on earth had that
  photograph of Kitty and himself found its way into that solitary hut previous
  to the tragedy? Heather had been proud of the photograph at the time, and had
  given a dozen or more to his friends, scattered all over the world, but, so
  far as he could remember, not one of those photographs had found its way to
  the Dark Continent.</p>

  <p>"What can a chap do when he's all alone in the world?" Wilberforce went
  on. "I admit I've been a bit of a rotter. I was one at Harrow, and they fired
  me there. And they fired me out of the Army, too, and so I gradually got down
  to this. I suppose I ought to be happy enough. When I got back from Africa
  with all that stuff and sold it, I was worth nearly a hundred thousand
  pounds. But my mind's going, my boy. The doctor told me that, if I didn't
  leave the brandy alone, I should die of softening of the brain. But I can't,
  old chap, I can't! I'm a lonely man, and I sit at home and dream. And when I
  dream, I must drink. I can't go back to my own people. They are rich and
  respectable, and only yesterday my own sister cut me in the street. They
  would be glad to know that I was dead, and they'll have their wish before
  long, And, you know, though it gave me a fearful turn when I saw you
  to-night, sitting at this table like a man come back from the dead, I was
  glad to have a chance to talk to you. And I don't care much what Mombassa
  told you&mdash;I don't care much about anything. But this is something like
  the truth. We got wind of what those niggers were after, we knew they were
  going to attack us that night, and we knew that the Arabs had bribed our boys
  and armed them against us. So they sent me up from the camp to the place on
  the river where the ivory and the rest of the stuff was waiting in the
  canoes, and I was to bring the lot down to the camp. As a matter of fact,
  most of the valuables had been stored on the raft, which we were going to
  float down the river to the fort. You remember the spot? There's a fork in
  the stream just above Comba, and here the river divides, and joins again
  about a mile lower down. There isn't a faster-running drop of water in
  Africa. You know it?"</p>

  <p>Heather nodded. He knew that atmosphere well; he could feel the pressure
  of it on his shoulders like a thick grey blanket, stifling his breath and
  taking all the elasticity out of his limbs.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know it," he said. "I can smell the odour of those infernal
  crushed marigolds even now. But go on."</p>

  <p>"I emptied the canoe off the raft and shoved it down into the stream. And
  then, somehow, in the darkness and the confusion&mdash;put it down to my own
  state of funk, if you like&mdash;I took the wrong bend in the stream where it
  forked, and when I got opposite the camp, on a little island, instead of
  being close to my pals, as I had expected, and where they would have had a
  chance to join me, I found myself on the other side of the eyot, quite four
  hundred yards away from the others, and I give you my word of honour that I
  never realised what had happened till I discovered my mistake. But I couldn't
  have gone back if I would. No man born of woman could have hauled the raft
  back up against the stream."</p>

  <p>Heather nodded, and the other man went on.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I had to go forward. I managed to stay the course of the raft
  for a minute or two, and look through the bushes towards the camp. Then a
  fire blazed out from somewhere, and everything became as light as day. I saw
  the camp rushed by our boys and some of the Arabs. I saw Brass shot through
  the heart, and Crossley cut to pieces. And I don't hold myself guilty in the
  least. Not that it much matters now, anyway. When I got down to your little
  dug-out, I found nothing but what I told you, and after that I set off down
  stream, and reached the fort about daylight. And&mdash;and that's all. What
  do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>"A, very plausible story," Heather said coldly. "The phrase is not
  original; it is occasionally used by a judge after he has listened to a
  prisoner giving evidence on his owm behalf. I repeat, a very plausible
  story."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe a word of it?" Wilberforce asked.</p>

  <p>"Only a few details. No doubt you meant well enough at first, but you
  don't ask me to believe that a man who knew every inch of the ground as well
  as you did took the wrong fork in the river? You didn't. You got away with
  the spoil, and your pals lost their lives. No, it doesn't matter in the least
  how the man you call Chambers got away. It's not a pleasant story, Mr.
  Wilberforce, and it isn't a pleasant object who is telling it, as you would
  admit if you could see yourself in the looking-glass. Still, it isn't for me
  to judge you. Now, have you done anything to make amends? I suppose you knew
  something about your friends?"</p>

  <p>"About as much, as I wanted to know"&mdash;Wilberforce laughed
  harshly&mdash;"and they knew much the same about me. I knew they had both
  been in trouble in this country, and that Brass and Crossley were assumed
  names. They were under the impression that mine was, too, and we let it go at
  that. Curiosity out yonder is not the sort of weakness people are given to.
  So there was nothing for it but to come back home and settle down to a life
  of pleasure. Pleasure! Good Heavens! And all I can do is that." He touched
  his liqueur glass again and smiled bitterly. "I come here every night and
  dine in solitary state, and afterwards I go to bed and sleep as best I can.
  And some night I shall die in my sleep, so the doctor tells me. I ought not
  to touch a drop of alcohol&mdash;it's fair poison to me. But I can't let it
  alone. And until I met you to-night I have never had a chance. Of course, you
  are entitled to half that money, and you can have it to-morrow with pleasure.
  Would you like to come round to my rooms now and talk it over? What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have a look at that photograph, at any rate," Heather said. "And as
  to the rest, I have got a little confession to make to you."</p>

  <p>Wilberforce rose with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Not now," he said. "Not here. Waiter, order me a taxi at once. Come
  along. Chambers, or Heatger, as you like to call yourself. It's all the same
  to me."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Heather was seated in a luxuriously appointed
  dining-room in Carlisle Mansions, with the photo by Lesterre in his hand.
  Beyond doubt it was the same that he and Kitty had had taken before he had
  gone out on that last job to West Africa three years ago. He waved
  Wilberforce's cigarettes and whisky and soda on one side.</p>

  <p>"Presently," he said. "Now, listen to me, Mr. Wilberforce. That is my
  photograph all right, and also that of the lady whom I am engaged to. It was
  taken by Lesterre when we were first engaged, on the eve of my departure for
  Africa. There were about two dozen done altogether, and I suppose I must have
  given away quite half of them to various friends. And I have friends in my
  line all over the world. But how that photograph found its way into the hut
  you speak of, I have not the remotest idea. It is one of the things that no
  one can understand. Not that it matters."</p>

  <p>"You left it in the hut yourself, of course. Could any explanation
  possibly be easier?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't, because I was never there. I told you my name was Heather, and
  it always has been. I am not Chambers&mdash;I don't know anything about him.
  When you met me to-night, you jumped to the conclusion that I was Chambers
  because you recognised me from the photograph. Well, I'm not. I know the
  locality you speak of, because business has taken me there&mdash;a vile hole
  I was only too glad to get out of&mdash;but I assure you that we have never
  met before to-night, I am not the man you take me for, and your confession
  has been merely wasted. No, stop a minute. I need not say that I shall
  respect your secret. I'll go away presently, and there's no reason why we
  should ever meet again."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," Wilberforce almost pleaded, "and don't despise me more
  than you can help. Heavens, if you only knew what a relief it has been to me
  to get that confession off my soul! Try and realise how lonely I am, and
  there is no place in the world where you can be so lonely as in London. And I
  swear to you. Heather, that you are wrong. I didn't deliberately betray those
  chaps. I had drunk my nerves into fiddlestrings, and, when the pinch came, I
  was no better than a white-livered coward, and that is why I more or less
  left the others to their fate. And they weren't worth saving, either. They
  were no better than myself. And you won't leave me? Look here, I gather you
  are up against it, I gather that you are going out to that infernal place
  again because you are in need of a job. Well, don't go. Stay here with me,
  and I will make it worth your while. As things go, I am a rich man, but I
  would sacrifice cheerfully every penny I have for a real friend. I'll lend
  you the money, if you like, or I'll give it to you, and you can purchase
  yourself a sound partnership at some engineering firm here at home. It won't
  be for long, because I am done for. A few weeks at the outside, and my
  troubles will be all ended. I have disregarded what the doctor told me; I
  drink and drink, and my heart is hopelessly gone. One of these nights I shall
  go to bed, and when they come to call me in the morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wilberforce waved his hand comprehensively. Beyond doubt he was an object
  of pity, a thing to be sorry for, despite all his enviable surroundings, and
  Heather found himself more moved towards him than he cared to confess.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," Wilberforce went on, "I won't press you any further. But if
  you could come and see me now and then, I should be more than grateful. And I
  must do something with that money. I want someone to have it who will make
  better use of it than I have done. Do you know what I was going to
  do&mdash;what I had done, practically? I was going to leave everything to the
  girl in that photograph. For a year that photograph has been on my desk, and
  gradually I have fallen in love with the girl in it. You have no idea what a
  companion she has been to me. Of course, you will say I am talking hysterical
  nonsense, but this is the first time in two years that I have confided in a
  soul. Now, I am a dying man. I am going to the sea to-morrow, to stay a spell
  in a home. I know perfectly well that I shall never come back. It's too late,
  my boy. If I had met a man like you a year ago, perhaps But why go on? Will
  you do me a little favour? Will you tell that young lady my story, and bring
  her round here to see me when I come back, if ever I do come back? She won't
  want any persuading. A girl with a face like hers would never hesitate to
  give a kind word or a helping hand even to the most degraded wretch who ever
  found himself in the gutter. Now, will you do this for me?"</p>

  <p>"I will," Heather said impulsively. "I have heard some strange stories in
  my time, and I have mixed with some strange people, but I have never had so
  remarkable an experience as this, and, though it may not sound common-sense,
  I believe what you say. I believe you are telling me the truth. I believe
  this all the more because I know what that awful climate and what the stuff
  men drink out there can bring the best of chaps to in time. I am not going to
  preach, Wilberforce. And&mdash;well, you go off to the seaside, as you have
  arranged, and in a week or so I'll come down and see you. And I promise you
  that I'll bring Miss Vaughan along; I know she'll be interested in your
  story. And it may not be too late yet if you will only try and hold yourself
  in hand. You are a rich man, and, from what I gather, it is not impossible
  for you to discover anyone who is entitled to a share of that money. Don't be
  down-hearted. With any luck, there should be many years of usefulness before
  you yet. Now, give me the address where you are going to, and leave the rest
  to me."</p>

  <p>"You are a good fellow, Heather," Wilberforce said unsteadily. "Now, if
  you will, in return, give me Miss Vaughan's address, I won't bother you any
  more to-night."</p>

  <p>For some time after Heather had gone Wilberforce sat down to his desk and
  was busy writing. Then he rose with a sigh of weariness and satisfaction, and
  glanced hesitatingly in the direction of the spirit stand. It was only for a
  moment that he hesitated, then he poured himself out half a tumbler of neat
  spirit and drank it greedily.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he muttered. "It can make no difference now&mdash;nothing can
  make any difference now&mdash;and perhaps&mdash;nay, certain&mdash; it is all
  for the best."</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Heather and his companion alighted at Southbourne, and made their way
  through the broad, leafy streets in the direction of Cliff House. There was a
  sparkle of expectation in Kitty Vaughan's blue eyes and a tender smile upon
  those sensitive lips of hers, for she and Heather had been discussing
  Wilberforce on the way down, and Kitty's heart was full to overflowing with
  the pity she was feeling for the lonely man who was so eagerly awaiting their
  arrival. She was not thinking of herself or Heather just then, she had
  forgotten that before long George would be on his way to West Africa again,
  and that the waiting years lay before her once more. That was not Kitty's way
  when others were in trouble.</p>

  <p>A neat servant-man threw open the door of the pleasant house standing in
  the gardens back from the cliff, and his face was solemn as he read the card
  that Heather handed to him.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Westcott will be very pleased to see you, sir," he said. "I

  tell you, sir, that Mr. Wilberforce is dead. He died in his sleep last night.
  We found some papers by the side of his bed which were addressed to you. I

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY STEVEN SPURRIER</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLV, Mar 1917, pp
  445-450</h3>

  <p class="first">THE individual known from Great Barrier Reef to the New
  Hebrides, and from Trobiand to the Three Kings as "Buck 'o the Islands"
  lounged on the deck of the yacht <i>Nevermore</i> discoursing learnedly upon
  the beauty of Aristophanes, one of whose plays lay on his immaculate knee.
  Over against him in another deck-chair sat Hilary Drake, known through the
  islands as "Pintail," listening good-naturedly to what he did not understand.
  But then Drake always was a good-natured man, a man of qualities and
  quantities, especially the latter, and perhaps the best-tempered pirate in
  the whole of the Coral Seas. He was by way of being the right-hand man of Jim
  Lovelace&mdash;" Buck o' the Islands" aforesaid&mdash;Chief of Staff, High
  Commissioner&mdash;in fact, a sort of Pooh Bah to the expeditionary force
  which had its headquarters on board the <i>Nevermore</i>.</p>

  <p>To put it quite frankly, from the point of view of effete Western
  civilisation, the owner and crew of the <i>Nevermore</i> were pirates, and
  the <i>Nevermore</i> had been nosing about in those golden seas for the last
  few weeks, seeking for adventure, and it seemed to Lovelace as if he had
  found it. They were really lying up now on the lee of Discovery Island,
  waiting for events. They had passed, late in the afternoon, between two
  pillars of basaltic rock into the lagoon beyond, and lay there in the
  sweltering heat on a sheet of water as smooth and flawless as a mirror. There
  was no beach there, nothing but the volcanic rampart, some sixty feet in
  height, sheer at the edge as if it had been cut by a knife, except for one
  flight of steps leading up to the island&mdash;a flight of steps that could
  have been defended by one man against a ship's crew, and this Lovelace did
  not fail to notice. Above the terrace of shining rock were the cocoanut
  palms, and beyond that the jewel beauties of Discovery Island, flashing and
  glittering like some great gem flung down there on the bosom of the South
  Pacific. The lagoon itself, with its trending shore, was not less than
  gifteen miles in diameter, and a land-locked harbour large enough to hold the
  fleets of the world. And it was this rampart that Lovelace and his crew were
  going to storm presently, if the god of battle smiled on their side.</p>

  <p>Lovelace jerked a finger over his left shoulder towards three boats that
  lay in the west of the lagoon.</p>

  <p>"There they are," he said. "The Yankee and the Spaniard and tbe Chinaman
  are all there, waiting for their prey. They will land at dusk. Nobody lands
  here in the daylight, because Hellmer only knows the way up the cliffs, and
  no white man has ever been along those cliffs in daylight. I wormed that out
  of Lin Chin. They are landed in boats after dusk, and taken up to Hellmer's
  bungalow, where they are filled up to the chin with 'square-face,' after
  which the auction begins. But no one stays the night. The business is knocked
  off in an hour or so, and those chaps are escorted back to their boats by a
  dozen or so of specially-selected Kanakas armed with Lee-Enfields. Oh,
  Hellmer is pretty thorough, like all the rest of his accursed race."</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" Drake asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, at present I haven't any plans," Lovelace confessed. "Here, take
  these glasses and see if you can spot any place all round the lagoon where it
  is possible to land."</p>

  <p>Drake took the powerful Goetz binoculars and carefully swept the ten miles
  or so of sheer basalt that fringed the blue waters of the lagoon. But that
  keen eye of his could make out no sign of a break anywhere. So the two men
  sat there on deck till the darkness began to fall, and they were still
  debating the knotty point as the graceful lines of the yacht faded into the
  gloom, and night shot down upon them like a violet blanket. In the stillness
  they could bear the sound of oars as the boats put out from the three other
  craft lying there on the face of the lagoon. Precious time was passing, and
  as yet nothing had been done. Then Lovelace, who had ears like a hare, lifted
  his head suddenly and held up a warning finger.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear anything?" he whispered. "Call for lights and keep the deck
  clear. Unless I am mistaken, somebody is swimming out to us from the
  shore."</p>

  <p>The ship's lantern was placed on the deck by the side of the big chairs,
  and the two men sitting round it waited. Then in the gloom something seemed
  to move up the ladder, and a shadowy outline came towards the light.</p>

  <p>As the figure emerged into the yellow circle, a quick exclamation broke
  from Lovelace as he rose to his feet. Accustomed as he was to quick, dramatic
  surprises, here was one that shook him for a moment out of his studied
  calm.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens," he exclaimed, "it's a woman&mdash;an European woman, and a
  beautiful one at that!"</p>

  <p>She stood there panting for a moment in the circle of light, a slim,
  graceful figure, golden brown as to her limbs and black as to the hair that
  streamed over her shoulders. She wore a simple bathing-dress of some black
  material, cut low in the neck and high above the knees. She was exceedingly
  fair to look upon, absolutely self-possessed, with the free manner of the
  Southern Sea, and yet with that daintiness and charm that marks birth and
  refinement all the world over. She was utterly devoid of self-consciousness,
  too, with a suggestion of one who passes a deal of her time in the water.
  Indeed, she could not have swum less than six miles, and that in a sea which
  is not free from the wandering shark.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to alarm you," she said, speaking in slightly broken English
  with a French accent, "but I saw your boat, or I should say your yacht, and,
  behold, I knew you were different to the men who come here. So, when it got
  dark, I made up my mind to swim out and ask you to help me."</p>

  <p>"It will be a distinct pleasure," Lovelace said. "Here, Drake, go and get
  a wrap from somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I will take no harm on a hot night like this," the girl said, with a
  charming smile. "Half my time I live in the water. It is, alas, the only
  place that is left to me. But surely I am speaking to Mr. Lovelace."</p>

  <p>"The same, at your service," the bewildered Lovelace responded. "I am
  desolate&mdash;I am ashamed to say that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you have forgotten me, is it not? The last time I saw you I was
  staying with the Treehawks. Lady Treehawk was at school with me in Paris, and
  before I came back here she asked me to visit her. Now do you remember?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all coming back to me now," Lovelace lied politely. "I have
  forgotten your name,"</p>

  <p>A charming little smile rippled on the girl's cheek.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see you have," she said demurely. "I am Vivette Lesterre, the
  daughter of Antoine Lesterre of this island."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Lovelace exclaimed. "But I thought&mdash;What about the German,
  Hellmer. Isn't he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was my father's overseer. Eighteen months ago he murdered my father,
  and I have been kept a prisoner on this island ever since. Would it fatigue
  you if I told you the story?"</p>

  <p>It was all coming back to Lovelace now. He began to remember the story of
  the little French beauty whom he had met just before the bottom fell out of
  his universe, and what Lady Treehawk had told him about her. She was the
  daughter of a brilliant French statesman, who had in some way entangled
  himself in a financial scandal, and had subsequently disappeared, to be heard
  of fitfully from time to time as a central figure in a romantic story set in
  the Coral Seas. He had apparently done well there, and had subsequently sent
  his only daughter home to Paris to be educated. It had all been nebulous
  enough at the time, but it was crystal clear now, on the deck of the
  <i>Nevermore</i>, in the violet darkness under the Southern Cross. And as
  Lovelace listened, his face softened strangely, though his lips were grimly
  set and there was a fighting light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This must be looked to, Drake," he said. "Now, my dear young lady, I
  think you can trust me. I take it that you have some secret means of reaching
  the beach which is unknown to the genial pirate who governs Discovery
  Island?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Vivette said eagerly. "There are many things that Hellmer does
  not know. Our bungalow he has taken for himself, and I have a tiny place some
  two miles away, where I am left entirely to myself, with one or two of my
  faithful natives. Hellmer does not trouble me. His one object is money, and
  when he has made enough he will probably go back to his Fatherland and leave
  the island to me. There is a way down to the beach from the brush at the back
  of my bungalow&mdash;a secret passage through the volcanic rock&mdash;that is
  known only to me and the Kanakas whom I can trust. And if you will follow me
  presently, I will show you the way, but not till I have prepared my people
  for your coming. Then away to the right yonder, in a line with the high peak,
  you will see a light. Pull for that light, and I will await you there."</p>

  <p>With which the girl rose to her feet and strode across the deck of the
  <i>Nevermore</i> in the direction of the ladder. She laughed to scorn the
  idea that she would come to any harm as she let herself down the side of the
  yacht and dropped quietly into the smooth, warm water.</p>

  <p>"Well," Lovelace said, "this looks like being some adventure. We are going
  to be the squire of dames. Now let's go below and tell the boys all about
  it."</p>

  <p>It was just over an hour later that a boat put off from the
  <i>Nevermore</i> in the direction of a tiny light that gleamed from the foot
  of the cliff some four miles away. In the boat were Lovelace and Drake and
  one Captain Blossom, the latter a thick-set Englishman, with a chest like
  Hercules and the bull-dog strength of an international Rugger player, which,
  indeed, he had been in the past, though not known to his contemporaries by
  the name of Blossom. There were four other men in the boat, equally reckless
  and equally prepared to do anything in the way of a fight that came along.
  They pulled silently in the direction of the light, and beached their boat
  presently on the tiny spit of white sand where Vivette was awaiting them. In
  the background were one or two dusky shadows, evidently the friendly Kanakas
  whom the girl had mentioned. Then one by one they faded away in the darkness
  along a tiny cleft in the basalt rock that led upwards by rude steps to the
  cliffs beyond, and here Lovelace's fair guide halted.</p>

  <p>"The hut is just over there," she explained. "I think I will wait till you
  return. Two of my boys shall guide you in the direction of the bungalow, and
  show you where Hellmer has placed his sentries."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," said Lovelace cheerfully. "In an hour we shall be
  back here with your fortune. And then, perhaps, you may honour me with being
  my guest on the yacht, so that I can pilot you back between the New Hebrides,
  and in a day or two pick up the steamer which will take you to New Zealand.
  Am I impertinent, or would you mind telling me where you would go, once you
  find yourself back in England again?"</p>

  <p>"To Lord and Lady Treehawk," the girl said. "I think I could trust him,
  don't you, Mr. Lovelace?"</p>

  <p>"I should think so. If there is an honest man in the world&mdash;and in
  that respect I am on all fours with the late lamented Mr. Diogenes&mdash;then
  I should say that man is Jack Treehawk. By all means go back to him and tell
  him what has happened. Tell him anything so long as you keep my name out of
  it, and the names of my friends on the <i>Nevermore</i>.</p>

  <p>They plunged on presently, with the Kanaka leading in the direction of the
  bungalow that they could see through the palms, one blaze of electric light.
  Then Lovelace, with his faithful band of followers behind him, stepped
  noiselessly on to the verandah and looked through the open windows into the
  dining-room beyond. There were only four men, all told, sitting in that
  luxurious apartment, with Hellmer, big and bloated and glistening in his thin
  vest and unstarched trousers, sprawling at the head of the long table, with
  Pardon, the Yankee skipper, Doggone, the Spaniard, and Lin Chin, the
  Chinaman, big and sturdy, yellow as a guinea, and wrinkled like the skin of a
  melon. On the table was a choice assortment of bottles of all sorts, and it
  was evident, from the noise and laughter that was going on, that the pearl
  dealers had been drinking heavily.</p>

  <p>Upon this noisy, rowdy, blasphemous group Lovelace descended, bland,
  smiling, and immaculate, a monocle glistening in his eye, and his spotless
  white dandy clothes in fine contrast to the dingy garments of the rest.</p>

         title="Upon this noisy, rowdy, blasphemous group Lovelace descended.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Salaam, sahibs," Lovelace said coolly. "I trust my presence is no
  intrusion."</p>

  <p>Hellmer lifted his huge bulk and swore floridly,</p>

  <p>"Buck o' the Islands!" he grunted. "Now, what in thunder are you doing
  here? This ain't no safe place for strangers, and so I tell you."</p>

  <p>As the German spoke, he reached over in the direction of an electric bell
  on the wall. Lovelace put up his hand.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't do that if I were you," he said quietly. "I am not armed
  myself, but there are others behind me in the darkness who are more
  fortunate. And if you want your sentries, then I tell you frankly they are
  otherwise engaged. Come, Herr Hellmer, there is no occasion to quarrel. I
  also have a fancy to do a little dabbling in pearls, and I think my financial
  credit is at least equal to that of the gentlemen I see around me. Won't you
  sit down?"</p>

  <p>The question was almost a threat, and Hellmer, with an uneasy laugh,
  dropped into his chair again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," he muttered. "And if you like to bid for some of the
  pearls on yonder table&mdash;well, it is not for me to complain."</p>

  <p>Lovelace's quick eye noted approvingly the mass of pearls laid out in
  glistening profusion on wash-leather bags lying on a little table. In any
  open market they would have realised at least a hundred thousand pounds, and
  one of them&mdash;three magnificent pearls fused together in the rough form
  of a cross&mdash;might easily have fetched a quarter that sum; and as
  Lovelace's eye fell upon it, his lips tightened and his brows gathered into
  an ominous frown.</p>

  <p>"When are we going to begin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Now," the German snapped. "We will take the first lot. Mr. Lin Chin, 2hat
  do you say?"</p>

  <p>The Chinaman opened modestly, and by quick bids five thousand dollars was
  reached. Then the Spaniard bid another hundred, and Pardon, the American,
  capped it with fifty. But with every lot, as it came along, and with every
  bid, Lovelace went one better, until practically the whole of the glittering
  objects on the table had become his property at a price that staggered the
  local ring. They were not accustomed to do business with a man like this, and
  if looks could have killed the immaculate figure in the white ducks, he would
  have dropped dead at their feet. They were whispering ominously amongst
  themselves, and presently Lovelace noticed that a couple of revolvers lay on
  the table. It was the American who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"I guess we're going to have no more of this," he said. "Say, stranger,
  what's the game? We haven't been running this show all these years to be
  bluffed by a guy like you. You are cramping the market. Clear whilst the
  going's healthy!"</p>

  <p>Lovelace waved the suggestion aside pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he said. "Fact is, we're only just beginning. And I guess
  my money's as good as yours, though Mr. Hellmer will have to take my
  cheque."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," the German growled. "Cheques don't go in Discovery
  Island. If you can't put down the dollars, then it's no deal."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you'll take my cheque," Lovelace said quietly. "Any other
  man in the islands would, as you know very well."</p>

  <p>"Put up the big lot, Mr. Hellmer," the Chinaman said persuasively. "It was
  him what I come for. I'll offer you ten thousand dollee for um on the
  spot."</p>

  <p>"I am going to have it for less than that," Lovelace said
  crisply&mdash;"in fact, I'm going to have it for nothing. That cluster of
  pearls belongs to me, and don't you forget it. Here, look at this, Mr.
  Hellmer. It's a photograph&mdash;a photograph of that cluster of pearls taken
  eighteen months ago by the late Antoine Lesterre, and shown to me by him on
  Loyalty Island. He'd only just found it, and because he wanted to buy a new
  steamer in a hurry, and hadn't the ready money on him, I advanced him ten
  thousand dollars on that pearl, and I've got his receipt for it in my pocket
  at this moment. If any of you blackguards like to see it, here it is."</p>

  <p>The little group round the long table shuffled uneasily. They knew bluff
  when they saw it, but there was no bluff here, as every one of those hardened
  ruffians knew only too well. Hellmer boiled over, furious and foaming.</p>

  <p>"You lie, you dog, you lie!" he hissed. "If that is so, why was the pearl
  not delivered to you?"</p>

  <p>"It would have been if you hadn't murdered the owner in cold blood,"
  Lovelace said coolly. "You came here broke and penniless, hunted from one
  island to another, hated and feared by every fellow-scoundrel in the Coral
  Seas, and Antoine Lesterre gave you a roof and work to do. And when the time
  came, you collected those half dozen ruffians of yours from New Caledonia,
  and shot your benefactor down as he sat at the table where you are sitting
  now. You can't deny it, and, even if you did, my proofs are beyond question.
  And now you know. All those pearls there belong to me&mdash;every one of
  them. Not that I am going to keep them&mdash;I shall merely hold them in
  trust for the daughter of the man whom you treated so vilely, the girl who
  has so long been a prisoner on this island. I am sorry to disappoint you,
  gentlemen, but disappointment is the common lot of all of us, and, besides, I
  have behind me an argument which you will appreciate, the only argument that
  goes in the Coral Seas&mdash;the logic of force. And now, you cold-blooded
  murderer, what are you going to do? What have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>The big German was saying nothing. His great, bloated face wet and
  ghastly, and his huge limbs trembling with fear, he rose to his feet and
  backed steadily away from the table in the direction of the desk that stood
  in the angle of the wall. Just for a moment Lovelace could not quite
  comprehend what was going on, till he saw the German turn with a swiftness
  almost incredible for one of his bulk, and a second later the Englishman had
  a vision of the blue rim of a revolver in the direct line of his head. It had
  all happened as quickly as a flash of lightning, but out there in the velvet
  darkness someone, looking into the blazing room, had been quicker still.
  Before the German could crook his finger iu the trigger, there was a little
  whiplike crack and a tiny spit of flame from the gloom, and the big German
  collapsed like some great empty sack on the floor. He lay there quite dead,
  with a neat little blue mark plumb in the centre of his great beetling
  forehead.</p>

  <p>The three men sitting round the table stirred uneasily, but none of them
  moved. It was up to them to take no hand in the game, and as the American
  muttered in his beard, "it was no funeral of his." The German had been fool
  enough to try force in the face of a superior foe, and he had paid the
  penalty accordmg to the unwritten law of the island. It was the inevitable
  end of all of them, the one sure thing they had to look forward to, and in
  all probability they were safe enough if they played the game according to
  the recognised formula. It was the American who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Waal, I guess he asked for that, Mr. Lovelace," he said. "It was bound to
  come sooner or later, and, anyways, it was a neat shot. If you'll kindly
  untie one of them guards, I guess I'll be getting back to my boat."</p>

  <p>There was nothing more to be said or done, there was no further comment on
  what was, after all, the commonplace of the islands. Lovelace called his men
  in and gave them the necessary instructions. And then, as if he had been no
  better than a dead dog, three of the boat's crew picked up the carrion lying
  on the floor and took it out and buried it. Lovelace gathered up the pearls
  from the table and shovelled them carelessly into his pocket. Then he turned
  the lights out in the bungalow, and, with a friendly Kanaka to guide them,
  made his way back in the direction of the hut where Vivette was awaiting
  him.</p>

  <p>"We have been quite successful," he explained, "and all that remains to
  you is now in my pocket. You will be troubled no more with Hellmer. He tried
  treacherously to shoot me, but one of my crew was a bit too previous for him.
  We buried him half an hour ago. And now, my dear young lady, if you are quite
  ready, we will get back to the <i>Nevermore</i>."</p>

  <p>The golden days went on for a week or more, as the <i>Nevermore</i> swam
  in an azure sea through the New Hebrides in the direction of Loyalty Island.
  And day by day, until the mail steamer was sighted, Lovelace sat on deck
  talking to his fair companion, who listened as Desdemona listened to Othello,
  oft-times with grateful tears in her eyes. And then at length, when the
  steamer had been sighted, and Vivette's belongings had been put on board, she
  stood by the ladder with her hand in Lovelace's for the last time.</p>

  <p>"I can never thank you," she said. "Ah, what a friend you have been to me!
  When I think that I am leaving the <i>Nevermore</i> for ever, and that I
  shall not see you again, I could sit down and cry my heart out!"</p>

  <p>"Dear lady," Lovelace said, as he stood by the side with his hat in his
  hand, "dear lady, no woman has ever shed tears for me. And, besides, it is no
  very far cry to London."</p>

  <p>"I regard that as a promise," the girl said, with shining eyes. "Not
  to-morrow, perhaps, but some day."</p>

  <p>"He'll keep it," Drake chuckled. "He never broke a promise to a woman
  yet."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY STEVEN SPURRIER</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLV, Apr 1917, pp
  653-658</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE island of Bavia lay fused like some rare pearl in the
  heart of the golden Java Sea, that stretched away to the trembling horizon,
  with Ketapang looming out of it like a broken harp. Sea and sky blended
  together in a golden mist that lay light as thistledown upon an ocean of
  pathless blue, and everywhere was a suggestion of that golden land where it
  is always afternoon. And, looking down upon it from the back of the sloping
  beach, where the great tree-ferns trembled overhead, a man and a woman sat,
  as they had been sitting the last hour or more. He was young and lean and
  brown, with the sanguine eyes of youth that is ever seeking something, and
  not discouraged because so far he has not found it. And the girl by his side
  was small and dark and exquisitely made, a sort of Spanish Venus, in fact,
  with the dreamy sleepiness in her eyes that she inherited, perhaps, from some
  Velasquez ancestress. She was plainly dressed enough, in a linen skirt and
  jacket, and her luxuriant mass of dusky hair was innocent of any covering;
  her feet were bare, too, and the skirt of her dress came only a little below
  her knees, for she and her companion had been paddling in the lagoon at their
  feet in search of rare anemones, and, anyhow, it was Inez Barrington's mood
  never to wear shoes if it could possibly be avoided. She was at heart a
  creature of the fields and the woods, but there was breeding and pride of
  race in every line of her. She could speak freely enough, if she liked, of
  those Spanish ancestors of hers, and time had been when she had known the
  restrictions of school life in San Francisco; but that was before she had
  come out there to look after her father's house and keep that dreamy widower
  under some sort of affectionate subjection.</p>

  <p>All that had happened five years ago, and in that time she had seen John
  Barrington's more or less prosperous tobacco plantation drifting into decay,
  and the army of workers driven away, one by one, till not more than half a
  dozen of them remained. She had been long enough there to see the hacienda
  become little better than a creeper-clad ruin, picturesque enough, no doubt,
  behind its luxurious blaze of blossoms, and still comfortable in a Bohemian
  sort of way. For, sooth to say, John Barrington was a dreamer and a
  visionary, and ever a seeker after the will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

  <p>The two sitting there, looking out over the lagoon, had been discussing
  the shiftless Barrington, and, incidentally, the girl's future. There was
  just a tiny cloud now in those glorious dark eyes of hers, and a droop of the
  proud scarlet lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is a paradise, all right," Frank Preston said&mdash;"a paradise
  where I should be quite prepared to linger on, but for thought of the future.
  You know, we are all alike, Miss Barrington&mdash;all of us ever grasping for
  the phantom fortune and ignoring the chances that lie at our feet. I am the
  last man in the world to reproach your father."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed gently and turned those velvety eyes upon Preston's face
  for a moment. There was something in that glance that stirred his heart just
  a little.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said simply, "and sometimes I have meant to speak to you
  about it. Do you know, I never quite understood why you came here at all,
  and, for some reason, I have always regarded you as a man of independent
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"Haven't a cent," Preston said lazily. "I am a sort of object-lesson, a
  kind of idle apprentice. For ten years I have been floating about the world,
  seeking my fortune, but not very strenuously, I must own. I drifted here
  through Burma and Siam, looking for the Dawnstar."</p>

  <p>"So I have heard you say before," Inez smiled. "Mr. Preston, what
  precisely is the Dawnstar?"</p>

  <p>"I am not altogether sure that such a thing exists," Preston explained.
  "It's a sort of religion, I believe, like the famous gold mines in the Yukon,
  or the fabulous diamond that someone is always going to find in South Africa.
  They talked of it in Siam, under a different name, and they whisper of it in
  Borneo. It's like those pearls your father is always talking about&mdash;the
  pearls that he firmly believes lie at the bottom of the lagoon at our
  feet."</p>

  <p>"But his late partner found them," Inez said.</p>

  <p>"Blind luck," Preston replied&mdash;"absolutely blind luck. There! Now
  listen to me. What right have I to blame your father because he has wasted
  his life trying to find pearls that don't exist, when I am doing exactly the
  same thing with regard to the Dawnstar? In our heart of hearts, neither of us
  believes that there are either pearls or Dawnstars."</p>

  <p>"And yet my father's late partner found the pearls here," Inez said. "Not
  that I believe there are any left. But tell me&mdash; what is the
  Dawnstar?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a fabulous orchid. Wherever I go in this archipelago, I can
  always find some superstitious native who has heard of it, or who has heard
  of somebody who has seen it. No doubt there is some basis to the legend, and
  I have been fool enough to spend the best part of a year in these parts
  trying to verify it."</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of truth in what Preston said, but it was not the
  whole truth. He would never have stayed there so long, with the wanderer's
  virus in his veins, had it not been that he had given his heart to Inez
  Barrington, and that he was lingering there awaiting events. He perfectly
  understood how near the dreamy Englishman was to the verge of ruin, and how
  near he stood on the edge of the grave, and what would become of Inez
  afterwards was a problem that troubled Preston a great deal more than his
  search after the elusive Dawnstar. He had come there to investigate the
  legend, but it seemed to him that he had found something much more precious
  instead. And gradually his whole mind had become absorbed in Inez's future.
  He had been there for months, staying in the ruined old hacienda, seeing Inez
  day by day, studying all the beauties of that open mind of hers, and vainly
  regretting all his lost opportunities. There were the nights, of course, when
  he went out looking for the visionary Dawnstar, that was supposed to bloom
  only in the early hours between dusk and dawn; but so far he had not found
  it.</p>

  <p>He smiled with an air of superior wisdom when he saw Barrington wasting
  his time and neglecting his property over the brooding hours he spent on the
  lagoon in search of those mystic pearls, and occasionally he was conscious of
  a certain contempt for his own weakness. And day by day he could see that the
  dread consumption that was sapping Barrington's life was advancing nearer and
  nearer, and the problem of Inez's future troubled him more and more.</p>

  <p>"Let us be practical for once," Inez said. "What real good would the
  Dawnstar do for you if you found it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it would make my fortune, for one thing," Preston said. "It might
  be worth anything up to a hundred thousand pounds. There are men in England
  who tbink nothing of paying twenty thousand pounds for a new orchid. If I
  could get a few Dawnstars and distribute them judiciously, I should be a rich
  man. And, mind you, the thing actually does exist, because an Indian raja had
  one. It was destroyed by fire, but the thing undoubtedly was there, because a
  German collector I once met actually saw it. A lovely thing, Inez. Picture to
  yourself a plant that blooms in the early dawn or by artificial light, a
  plant that grows on slender threads no thicker than a cobweb, but strong
  enough to carry a cloud of blooms that resemble a collection of tropical
  butterflies. Twenty different blends of gorgeous colouring on one plant, and
  every separate bloom distinct. It rises in the primrose dusk from a handful
  of flat leaves, much as the Rose of Sharon blooms before it drops back into
  nothingness and leaves behind it what appear to be a few dusty, dead leaves.
  I believe it is an epiphyte&mdash;that is, a tree parasite&mdash;in other
  words, it clings to a dead stump. Or possibly it is a tuber. But I don't
  know. I am only telling you what I have been told. We might even be sitting
  on it at the present moment. You may laugh at me, if you like, but I believe
  it is here somewhere, and, if it is, I am going to find it. I wonder if your
  father has heard of the thing?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is exceedingly probable," Inez smiled. "He has never mentioned
  it, but then he knows I have not much sympathy with those dreams of his. He
  is full of all sorts of stories of that kind&mdash;pearls in the lagoon,
  buried treasure, and all that sort of thing. I am perfectly convinced that,
  if my father had lived in the time of Jason, he would have volunteered to go
  off in search of the Golden Fleece. We will ask him, if you like. I am sure
  he will be enthusiastic."</p>

  <p>They turned their backs on the golden sea presently, and wandered through
  the tree-ferns to the verandah of the house, where, amongst the bowery blooms
  that hung like dazzling jewels, they found Barrington, with his coffee and
  cigarettes, awaiting them. He was a small, slender man, with an eye of a
  dreamer and the peculiar waxen complexion of one who is far gone in
  consumption. With his scientific knowledge, it was patent enough to Preston
  that the end was not far off. For a little time they sat there talking,
  before Inez introduced the subject of the Dawnstar. Barrington's eyes lighted
  eagerly as he listened. At the same time his smile was one of toleration for
  the weakness of another.</p>

  <p>"I have heard something about it," he said. "Indeed, I am not so sure I
  haven't seen the thing. When I go down to the lagoon in the early morning,
  dredging for those big oysters, I seem to notice certain flowers that are not
  familiar to me; and, when I come back, they are no longer there. But it is
  only in one place&mdash;as you go down ^ the path by the spring where Inez
  grows some of those rare ferns she is so fond of. There used to be some trees
  at the back of the spring, and I believe that the stumps of them are there
  still. But it's no use asking me. You are only wasting your time, Preston.
  Now, if you will come with me some night down to the lagoon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The dreamer was mounted on his hobby now, and for some time he babbled
  more or less incoherently of the treasures that lay in the depths of the
  lagoon, if only it was possible to find them. He told his audience for the
  fiftieth time how his partner had accidentally come upon a strata of
  pearl-bearing oysters in the lagoon, where it had been possible to dredge
  them up, and how that aforesaid partner had returned to England with a
  fortune in his pocket. But he did not know, or he forgot to say, that for a
  year or two afterwards every idle native who could command a canoe and a
  dredge had raked the floor of the lagoon until there was not a single bivalve
  left. It was all very pathetic and a little ridiculous, but Preston, looking
  across at that beautiful face opposite him, could see nothing but the tragic
  side of the situation.</p>

  <p>And it did not seem ridiculous to him, as he lay awake that night; to
  think that Barrington's story had been the means of stirring his own latent
  hopes. Surely the Dawnstar was there somewhere, if he could only find it.
  And, if he could, then his problem and the problem of Inez's future would be
  solved. If he could once come upon the track of the Dawnstar, he would be
  able to speak the words which had been trembling on his lips for months, and
  put his fortune to the test. Not that he was afraid of what the answer would
  be, for Inez's nature was too frank and free to leave him with any illusions
  on that score. But come what may, and poor as he was, he was not going to
  turn his back upon the island of Bavia until he knew what was going to happen
  with regard to the woman whom he loved.</p>

  <p>As he lay on his bed, waiting for the dawn, his mind was troubled with
  many things. He had not been quite candid with Inez when he had spoken to her
  in that detached way about the Dawnstar. He had not told her, for instance,
  that the search for that elusive flower was almost as great an obsession with
  him as the treasures of the lagoon were with John Barrington. He had not told
  her that he had been following up a legend for years. He had tracked it in
  various ways and in various languages half through Asia and, by way of Siam,
  to the island of Borneo. He believed in its existence thoroughly, though he
  would have been ashamed to admit it. Indeed, a certain deceased German
  collector had actually seen it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in all the months that Preston had been on Bavia, he had been
  looking for the Dawnstar night after night. Ever since the first day that he
  had entered the hacienda and had become a member of that somewhat Bohemian
  household, he had been out before dawn in the swamps and round the lagoon,
  always looking for the Dawnstar. And yet he was deeply sorry for Barrington,
  whom he could not but regard as a fool and a visionary. He was the only man
  about the place who knew that Barrington spent half his nights in secret
  visits to the lagoon, where he was wearing out the little strength that
  remained to him in dredging up oyster shells, and, apparently, never tired of
  his pursuit. If Barrington had devoted a tithe of his time to his estate, he
  might by this time be a prosperous man. But the pathetic part of the tragedy
  lay in the fact that Barrington had no illusions on the matter of his health,
  and that he was doing all this in the forlorn hope of being able to leave a
  competence to his only child.</p>

  <p>And this was going on night after night; it went on still for weeks after
  the day when Preston had told Inez the history of the Dawnstar. It went on
  till one early dawn when Preston was out on his eternal search, and hanging
  more or less disconsolately around the spring, at the back of the lagoon,
  from whence the house derived its water supply. It was still dark, with the
  first suggestion of pallid rose in a morning sky, as Preston wandered down
  towards the lagoon in the aimless fashion that had become habitual to
  him&mdash;the aimless fashion of a man who begins to despair of his object.
  As he sat there, with a half-made cigarette between his fingers, Barrington
  passed him so closely that he could actually have touched him. The elder man
  was carrying some appliance on his back, and then, as Preston looked at him,
  he saw that the other was walking in his sleep.</p>

  <p>So it had come to that, Preston thought. Barrington was obviously worn
  out; his face was pale and drawn, and ever and again a hollow cough broke
  from him. It was bad for him to be out there in the dews of the early
  morning&mdash;fatally bad, no doubt&mdash;but he crept along down to his boat
  like a man in the last stages of exhaustion, a man whose will was evidently
  stronger than his body. He made his way slowly and laboriously into the
  middle of the lagoon, and from the bank Preston watched him for some time
  until suddenly he saw the dark figure collapse and crumble as if it had been
  an empty sack, and then there followed the sound of a faint splash.</p>

  <p>Preston was on his feet in a moment. He plunged headlong into the lagoon
  and swam out to the floating figure. It was a strenuous fight, but he had
  Barrington on the sand at length, still breathing, so he gathered the
  shrunken figure in his arms and carried him towards the house like a
  child.</p>

  <p>His mind was set now only on getting Barrington into bed, so that any
  thought of the Dawnstar was very far away just then. But as he was passing
  along the little hollow amongst the tree-ferns at the back of the spring, a
  solitary flower, all gold and azure, that seemed to be floating invisibly in
  the air, a foot or two from the ground, caught his attention and held him
  there for a moment absolutely motionless. Then he turned his face resolutely
  away and plodded on doggedly in the direction of the hacienda.</p>

  <p>He would not think of it. He would not believe anything till he had the
  burden in his arms safe between a pair of blankets. It must have been some
  figment of imagination, some phantasm born of the early dawn.</p>

  <p>So presently he laid Barrington on his bed and warmed him, and forced
  brandy between his lips until the sick man opened his eyes and feebly asked
  what had happened. Preston made him comprehend presently&mdash; indeed, told
  Barrington how he had been watched night by night, whilst the latter listened
  and nodded before he sat up and grasped Preston by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Not a word of this to Inez," he whispered. "I am a fool, perhaps, but
  then I have always been a fool&mdash;ever grasping for the shadow and
  neglecting the substance. Did you ever know an Irishman who did anything
  else? But I shall find it&mdash;I shall find it before I have done&mdash;yes,
  long before you find that Dawnstar that you were telling me about the other
  night."</p>

  <p>Preston smiled almost bitterly. He knew that hopeful outlook only too
  well. He crept away presently to his own room, and slept far into the
  morning. For the rest of the day he seemed rather to avoid Inez. He sat on
  the verandah in the evening, listening whilst she sang to him, and retired
  early to bed, but not to sleep. He tossed about from side to side till it
  seemed to him that the window frame in his bedroom began to stand out sharply
  against the darkness, and he arose and crept from the house like a thief, and
  made his way down to the spring. For a long time he sat there watching, as
  far as possible, the dusky area where he had seen that spirit blossom the
  night before. He watched until the ebony dusk turned to violet, and the
  tree-ferns behind him looked like gigantic feathers grotesquely painted on
  the sombre sky. He watched until his eyes began to ache and water stood in
  them. Then very slowly and gradually, like an amazing conjuring trick that he
  had witnessed in some Eastern bazaar, a faint intangible something&mdash;a
  collection of intangible somethings&mdash;began to materialise slowly and
  mysteriously against an opaque purple background.</p>

  <p>They came one by one, darting here and there like spirits, intangible,
  floating in nebulous space, and yet arranged in a sort of symmetrical order,
  one above the other, like so many painted blooms indented by an unseen hand
  in a great vase. They were detached, and at the same time formed, part of
  some harmonious whole, as if a painter had placed them there without
  supports. And, as Preston watched, he stiffened with an excitement that
  seemed to paralyse his very breathing.</p>

  <p>He could see the colours of the blooms by now&mdash;azure, purple, violet,
  pink, all the hues of the rainbow with their various blends and shades. There
  must have been five-and-twenty blooms at least, magnificent, glowing, full of
  life and beauty, and yet apparently living alone in the air. There must be a
  support somewhere, as Preston knew, but the stems were so fine and slender as
  to be absolutely invisible. They were flowers of Paradise, nothing less, a
  gleam of beauty and colouring surpassing naturalist's dreams.</p>

  <p>Preston dragged himself to his feet and took from his pocket a tiny
  glow-lamp to which a small dry battery was attached. Still trembling from
  head to foot in his excitement and admiration, he examined his treasure
  carefully and with the critical eye of the expert. He could see now, by the
  aid of the lamp, that those black filaments binding the glorious bouquet
  together were as fine and yet as strong as the metal filaments in an electric
  lamp. And then, as the dawn suddenly broke like a violet bombshell from
  behind the morning mists over the lagoon, those amazing blooms collapsed like
  a soap bubble, and nothing was left but a handful of tight green leaves
  clinging to a log of wood about the size of a man's thigh. Preston knelt
  almost reverently and raised the rotting log in his arms. A few minutes later
  it was hidden away in a dark corner of his bedroom and covered with a damp
  cloth.</p>

  <p>He had found it now, the search of years was finished, and the future lay
  plainly before him. Being a naturalist, he had seen quite enough to know that
  the plant he had secured was a large one, and that, in the hands of any wise
  horticulturist, the thing was capable of subdivision. It meant that, once he
  was safely home again, a fortune awaited him. And yet, even in that moment,
  he was conscious of the fact that he probably owed his amazing luck entirely
  to the other man, whose failure had brought about his own splendid
  chance.</p>

  <p>He said nothing about his find for the moment, and all the more so because
  Barrington was still confined to his bed, and likely to remain there for a
  day or two. But when dinner was over, and night had fallen at length, Preston
  expressed a desire to have his coffee on the verandah, and there, in the
  dusk, with Inez by his side, told her what he had seen the night before.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand what I mean," he said. "We must get your father away
  from here. If he doesn't go, he will die. He must go back to England; he must
  have a winter in Switzerland. If we could get him back to some bracing
  climate, he might live for years. As it is--"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know, I know!" Inez sighed. "But what can we do?"</p>

  <p>"You must let me do it for you," Preston said. "You really must. Did it
  never occur to you how kind you have been to me? I have been here for a year.
  I came as a total stranger, and you took me at my own valuation. I shall
  never forget it, Inez. And I believe I can help you."</p>

  <p>"You have found the Dawnstar?" Inez asked demurely.</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Preston rose and, going to his room, returned presently
  with the log, which he laid carefully down on the verandah. Then he turned
  upon it the light of the glow-lamp, which gleamed in the darkness through a
  violet shade exactly like the rays of the early dawn.</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"
     name="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="1301051h-images/TheDawnstar.jpg"
         title="Then he turned upon it the light of the glow-lamp.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Watch!" he whispered. "Watch!"</p>

  <p>Very gradually the mass of dusty leaves on the log began to expand until
  they turned over and showed their glossy undersides uppermost. Then a bloom
  appeared, followed by another and another a little higher up, until the whole
  glorious thing leaped into life, a creation of such beauty and tenderness and
  exquisite colouring that Inez cried aloud.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," she said. "There was never anything like it since the
  beginning of the world. Tell me all about it, Frank. How did you find it, and
  where? I wonder if I might touch it, or would it fade away like a dream?"</p>

  <p>Preston snapped off the light, and in a few moments the dusty leaves lay
  at his feet again. He carried the log into his room, and returned presently
  to the lighted dining-room, where Inez eagerly awaited him.</p>

  <p>"You have seen it now, and must believe,"' he said. "Inez, you have seen
  our fortune and our happiness."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he looked into the girl's shining eyes, and she came forward
  and threw an arm around his neck.</p>

  <p>"You mean that, Frank?" she whispered. "And you know&mdash;oh, yes, I have
  been waiting to hear you say that for a long time. And you know it, too."</p>

  <p>Preston drew her close and kissed her. "Yes," he said simply, "I did. But
  can't you see that I could not speak before? I had no right to speak. But now
  it is all different. Now I have found something that is infinitely more
  precious to me than all the Dawnstars that ever bloomed. Not that I am
  indifferent to it, either, because it means happiness and fortune to us, and,
  I hope, many years of life yet for your father, because he is going to share
  it, because without him there would never have been you, and without him
  there never would have been a Dawnstar to light us on our way."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY STEVEN SPURRIER</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLV, May 1917, pp
  731-736</h3>

  <p class="first">GORDON HARLEY was thinking it over. He sat there alone
  outside the camp, on the high ground overlooking the fever-stricken valley,
  where that distinguished patriot Don Miguel del Carados was constructing the
  railway which was eventually to make the State of Tigua prominent amongst
  nations. But that was a long way off yet&mdash;as far off as was the
  civilisation that the soul of Gordon Harley coveted. Just at that
  moment&mdash;in fact, at any moment during the last month or two&mdash;he was
  fed up with the man who had lured him away from Western joys to this, the
  most beautiful and at the same time the most monotonous spot on the continent
  of South America.</p>

  <p>And that fat and oily Spaniard had been so plausible about the whole
  thing, too. He had painted Tigua as a sporting paradise&mdash;just the very
  place for a man of means who was looking for things to kill; just the sort of
  thing for a man who had recently come into a lot of money, and who had turned
  his back joyfully on the medical profession, and who hoped never to handle a
  stethoscope or study the colour scheme of a human tongue again. This had all
  taken place one starry night in the patio of a Charlestown hotel, where Del
  Carados was taking in stores for his pet railway. And, besides, he wanted a
  doctor badly. There were fifteea hundred workmen of sorts on the railway,
  mostly natives, with a few Europeans gathered without testimonials from
  various quarters of the globe, and if there was one drawback to that earthly
  paradise in question, it was an occasional outbreak of malaria in the rainy
  season.</p>

  <p>"You come, along with me, my friend," the Spaniard had said. "You come and
  stay just as long as you like&mdash;a week, a month. I will put you up, and
  you shall be my honoured guest. The valley is a sporting paradise."</p>

  <p>And Harley, having nothing else to do, and in the first flush of his new
  fortune, had gladly consented. He had come there by sea, of course, and up a
  yellow river flowing through a swampy country to the valley where the few
  miles of rails were under construction. It was a tedious journey, and a
  somewhat intricate one, but Harley had not worried himself much about that at
  the time, for his mind was full of jaguars and crocodiles, and such wild
  game, and, indeed, for the time being, he had all the sport he needed.</p>

  <p>And then gradually the truth began to dawn upon him. Those fifteen hundred
  or so of men who toiled and sweated in that mango swamp, where the miasma
  rose at evening, and the whole universe reeked with the smell of rotting
  vegetation, were no more than so many prisoners. They were well fed, it was
  true, they had strong things to drink and pungent tobacco to smoke, and, as
  to the few Europeans, they were perfectly happy in the knowledge that they
  were well outside the long arm of the law. But without money it was
  impossible to get away. Even if they had possessed the necessary funds, it
  would have been equally difficult, because nobody but Del Carados and one or
  two of his trusted Mexicans knew the secret of the way down the river, for
  the Rava had many tributaries, and all but one of them led to the mud swamps,
  which meant desolation and death and the feasting of the vultures that
  abounded there.</p>

  <p>But all this had come to Harley gradually. There was nothing brutal about
  the Spaniard, nothing of the slave-driver, for he was inclined to be fat and
  scant of breath, and, moreover, possessed a fine fund of humour of his own.
  He was candid, too. The scheme was to complete the railway up there into the
  mountains, and bring the copper ore down to the coast to be smelted. Once
  this was down, then the copper proposition was placed on a paying basis. This
  represented considerable wealth to the little tin Repubhc of Tigua, and in
  time much <i>kudos</i> for Del Carados, who began to see his way to the
  presidency of that delectable Republic, For Del Carados was a politician more
  than a statesman, which comes to much the same thing, and is a better paying
  proposition in the long run. And Del Carados had no ambitions. He did not
  want statuea in his honour, he did not hanker to become permanent President
  of the Republic&mdash;six months' manipulation of the national treasury funds
  filled up the measure of his ambition. In fine, he was a cheery, fairly
  good-natured rascal, who loved but two things in the world&mdash;his own
  comfort and a particularly fiery brand of Scotch whisky which was known in
  violent circles as the Clan MacTavish.</p>

  <p>It was impossible, therefore, for anyone to leave the valley of the Rava
  River and the work on the railway save at the Spaniard's good-will and
  pleasure. He was essentially monarch of all that he surveyed, and before very
  long, it became quite plain to Harley that he might, unless some
  extraordinary piece of luck came his way, regard his appointment as medical
  officer to the forces as a permanent one. In other words, he was as much a
  prisoner as the humblest labourer who wielded a pick or a spade.</p>

  <p>So far, there had been no outbreak of hostilities between the two men,
  though they perfectly understood one another, and Del Carados would smile his
  most genial smile when Harley crept back into the camp after three days'
  absence, a mere mass of skin and bone. Despite his weakness, and the fact
  that he had been looking death in the face for the last twenty-four hours, he
  had spoken his mind quite freely to Del Carados as they sat in the latter's
  hacienda over the evening meal. A bottle of the Clan MacTavish stood
  hospitably on the table, but Harley had waved it aside contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me," he said. "I have had about enough of this. I came
  here for two or three weeks as your guest, and to do a bit of shooting, also
  to act generally as a doctor until you could get someone to replace me."</p>

  <p>"I could never do that," the Spaniard said genially. There was a menace in
  his tone at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's what you mean, is it?" Harley said between his teeth. "Well,
  it's just as well we should understand one another. I am a prisoner here. You
  know I can't get away without your consent, and I suppose I can stay here and
  rot, for all you care. I am not concerned with your native workmen, because
  they are happy enough, and as to your European scum I hold no brief. But
  you're a blackguard, Del Carados, and you know it. If you have no sort of
  sympathy with me, you might, at any rate, send those Americans down to the
  coast."</p>

  <p>"And do without my evening's entertainment," Del Carados said, with a
  pained expression. "They came here cheerfully enough. I found them at
  Charlestown, stranded high and dry, with not a dollar between them. And am I
  not paying them fifty dollars a week? What more would you have?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you are promising them fifty dollars a week, but Mrs. Vansittart
  tells me that neither she nor her husband have ever seen the colour of your
  money. Send <i>them</i> off, at any rate."</p>

  <p>Del Carados smiled as he rolled himself a fresh cigarette. The humour of
  the situation evidently appealed to him. The Americans in question were two
  vaudeville artistes who had found themselves stranded owing to the
  backsliding of a manager and the subsequent disappearance of the treasury.
  They had been literally starving in Charlestown when the genial Spaniard had
  found them, and were only too glad to avail themselves of his glowing offer,
  which, it must be confessed, had been painted in alluring colours by one who
  was an artist in words. They sang and danced and played the Spaniard's
  jangling piano for his amusement night after night, what time he sat
  listening, soaked in his beloved Clan MacTavish, and applauded with
  large-hearted generosity and fine discrimination. The engagement of these
  people had been a stroke of genius on Del Carados's part, and he was not
  anxious to see the last of them.</p>

  <p>"No, no, my friend," he said. "They are quite happy here; they have been
  happy here for nearly a year. What more could they have? They are well paid
  and well fed, and they have only to amuse me for an hour or so after dinner.
  And look you, Senor Harley, don't you go too far. We have been good friends
  up to now, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And so for the moment Harley gave it up as a bad job. He was sitting out
  there, in the afternoon, under the shade of a big palm tree, chewing the cud
  of sweet and bitter reflection. He was contrasting himself, in his soiled and
  ragged linen suit, with the happy man who had set out, a year ago, to see the
  world, rich in health and pocket. And here he was, just as much a prisoner as
  if he had been legally sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. And there
  was no escape; he had tried that once, and he had no stomach to repeat the
  operation, for the horrors of that eight-and-forty hours in the mango swamps,
  with the snakes and the mud and the dull speculation in the eyes of the
  crocodiles, was still upon him. It was no wonder, therefore, that Del Carados
  was prepared to take risks, for he was safe enough, and far beyond the reach
  of any pro-consul.</p>

  <p>Harley took a photograph of himself from his pocket and gazed at it with
  the sentimental eye of one who regards the features of some beloved
  dead-and-gone departed.</p>

  <p>"And so that's me!" he murmured. "Good Heavens, impossible!"</p>

  <p>"I was just asking myself much the same question," a voice broke in, as a
  woman came down the slope and seated herself by Harley's side. "I don't think
  my friends in New York would recognise me, Mr. Harley."</p>

  <p>It was the vaudeville artiste who called herself Muriel Vansittart who
  spoke. She was slight and pretty enough, light-hearted and vivacious in the
  ordinary way, but pale and thin now, though there was a certain gleam of
  courage in her eyes that Harley had learnt to admire.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's pretty rotten, isn't it?" he said. "But what can we do? Try and
  escape? I have had some, thank you. I prefer to stay where I am."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," the woman said. "Bill and myself&mdash;that is, my husband,
  Vivian Vansittart&mdash;have had over a year of it. Mr. Harley, I am going
  out of my mind. I can't put up with this much longer. You don't know what
  it's like when the rainy season comes on. The weather breaks up suddenly, the
  glass drops about twenty degrees in five minutes, and half the camp is down
  with ague. They would have been all dead long before now if it wasn't for the
  quinine. Why, I've seen them swallow as much as would stand on a dollar! I
  haven't had it, and Bill hasn't had it, because we are both absolutely T.T.
  But it's dreadful, and I can't stand another rainy season here."</p>

  <p>"Pretty close now, isn't it?" Harley asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the rains may come at any time. Now, Mr. Harley, listen to me. I
  have got an idea. You're a doctor, and know all about drugs. You have the run
  of the store, and you do pretty well what you like. Oh, I have worked the
  whole thing out; I have been lying awake at night, thinking it over for a
  week. Now, supposing one of these early nights, when that fat old scoundrel
  is enjoying himself and is full of whisky, you drop a few grains of something
  soothing in his glass."</p>

  <p>"What good would that do?" Harley. asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am coming to that presently. Now, I've been making inquiries,
  asking artless questions, and I have discovered that Del Carados has only got
  two cases of whisky left. In about a week he will be sending down to the
  coast for another supply."</p>

  <p>"You mean we might try&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I don't mean anything of the kind," the actress said impatiently.
  "Now, whisper!"</p>

  <p>For a minute or two Mrs. Vansittart murmured eagerly into Harley's
  sympathetic ear. Gradually a smile that was cousin to a grin creased his
  lean, brown features.</p>

  <p>"Well; it's worth trying," he said at length. "It's risky, but Del Carados
  would do anything rather than go short of the Clan MacTavish. We'll try it
  the very first day that the weather shows signs of breaking up."</p>

  <p>That night, as they say on the cinematograph picture screens, the
  thermometer dropped nearly a score of points, and for a space Harley was busy
  in handing out doses of quinine to the shivering natives who clamoured about
  his hut. Then he crossed over to the hacienda and dined more or less
  riotously with his genial host and the two American artistes. It was nearly
  midnight before the Clan MacTavish had got in its genial work, aided by a few
  drops from a bottle in Harley's drug store, and the Spaniard slept peacefully
  in his chair. A few moments later the carefully-guarded key of the storeroom
  was abstracted from his pocket, and for the next hour or two Harley and his
  companions were exceedingly busy. Then they went off to their respective
  quarters, hoping for the best.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301051h-images/ADoseOFQuinine.jpg"
         title="The key was abstracted from his pocket.">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was well towards midday before the Spaniard burst into Harley's hut. He
  was wild and unshaven, untrussed as to his points, and generally bearing
  about him the unmistakable signs of what is graphically described as "the
  morning after the night before." The illuminating metaphor can go no
  further.</p>

  <p>"What you've done?"he foamed. "You've robbed me, you've swindled me! You
  break into my storeroom, you steal all my Clan MacTavish, you evaporate every
  grain of quinine! Is it a joke? Because it is like to be expensive. You dog,
  you tell me where those go, or I shoot you!"</p>

  <p>The Spaniard's careful English had disappeared in the stress of his
  emotion. He was truculent enough, but at the same time there was an imploring
  gleam in his eye that was not distasteful to his prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you've found out, have you?" he said coolly. "Well, now, listen to
  me. You can shoot me, if you like, you yellow dog, and you can murder that
  plucky little American woman and her husband, but it won't bring your whisky
  back again, and you can't live without it. You'll be dead in three days
  without your diurnal bottle of Clan MacTavish. And that's not the worst of
  it, my cheerful old sport. You let those peons know that you've run out of
  quinine just at the beginning of the rainy season, and they'll tear you in
  little bits. Now, take my advice and look at the thing in a rational light.
  You lured me here under false pretences, and made a prisoner of me, just as
  you did those two American artistes. You haven't the least intention that any
  of us shall see the coast again until this railway of yours is finished."</p>

  <p>"You will never see the coast again!" the Spaniard hissed " You will all
  be shot in an hour!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think so, dear old thing. You daren't do it. Just think of
  having to live without your beloved whisky for a whole fortnight! No more
  long amber-coloured drinks dashed with soda and cooled with chunks of ice, no
  more happy evenings when you are beautifully fuddled with that comfortable
  Charles Dickens sort of feeling under that big yellow waistcoat of yours! My
  dear chap, you really couldn't do it. Now, don't check that natural humour of
  yours, but try and recognise the funny side of the situation. No drinks and
  no quinine, and a big riot amongst the peons the first time the glass goes
  down! Look here, I'll make a bargain with you. I've worked the whole thing
  out, and it's just like this. You send us down the river this morning as far
  as the Great Mango Delta. Give us a canoe and some provisions and one of your
  paddlers to put us on the right way. When we get down to the delta, we shall
  be all right. Now, if you'll do that, I'll promise on my word of honour to
  send you back word where the quinine and whisky are to be found. If you like
  to refuse, and you think you can do without your beloved Clan MacTavish for a
  fortnight, and you don't mind running the risk of being torn to pieces by the
  peons, well and good. It's for you to say."</p>

  <p>Del Carados swore and threatened, he wept and cursed, and called down the
  vengeance of all the saints in his calendar on Harley's head, but the latter
  merely smiled. Then the Spaniard went away with a final threat of instant
  dissolution, only to return in an hour or two, looking more haggard and
  dejected than before, and prepared to make terms. He came with the Americans,
  possibly in the shape of hostages, but they were both as determined as was
  Harley himself. And so another hour or two passed in fruitless negotiation,
  till lunch-time arrived, finding Harley still master of the situation.</p>

  <p>"It's no use," he said. "We've had this over half a dozen times already.
  And my friends here are just as determined as I am. Now, sit down, like a
  sensible man and the born humorist that you are, and talk the matter over.
  Have some lunch; help yourself to some of that chicken."</p>

  <p>"I could not eat a mouthful," Del Carados said, in hollow tones. "I have
  eaten nothing to-day. My mouth, he is parched, and my tongue, he is dry as a
  piece of leather. Now, come, my dear friend, this joke has been carried far
  enough. Tell me where that whisky is, and where you've hidden the quinine,
  and all shall be forgiven."</p>

  <p>"It is forgiven now," Harley said drily. "Even your bitterest enemy would
  be sorry for you if he caught sight of that face of yours at the present
  moment. But it's no good, Del Carados. We can't die more than once. Neither
  can you, but your death promises to be a lingering one."</p>

  <p>Del Carados collapsed into a chair and openly bewailed the day that he was
  born. He tore his hair, he lapsed into strange tongues in a vocabulary that
  suggested the past master in the art of profanity, but all to no avail,</p>

  <p>"If I could do that," Vansittart drawled, "guess I could command a record
  salary in one of the New York theatres. Say, Don, what's your figure for a
  course of lessons?"</p>

  <p>Del Carados sat up suddenly. There was a certain air of dignity about him
  now as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am beaten," he said., "Other great men have been beaten before me, but
  few of them know how to recognise it. Ladies and gentlemen, you have got the
  best of the future President of the State of Tigua. Behold, I
  capitulate&mdash;it shall be just as you desire. But before I accompany you
  myself as far as the Great Mango Delta, in the name of Heaven, I implore yon
  to find me one little drink, a ghost of a one "</p>

  <p>"Not a drop," Harley said firmly. "No, the sheen of Clan MacTavish shall
  not shine for you until you have earned it. Now go off and get everything
  ready."</p>

  <p>It was barely an hour later before a properly equipped and provisioned
  canoe dropped down the river, past the alligator swamps, in the direction of
  the delta. At the prow two stalwart paddlers were being urged on by the
  dejected Spaniard, whose melancholy, however, did not seem to interfere with
  his flow of expletives, so that it wanted still an hour to sundown when at
  length the Mango Delta was reached. From this point the Spaniard and his
  peons would make their way back on foot, and Harley calculated with grim
  amusement that Del Carados would have earned the cherished Clan MacTavish
  before he got it.</p>

  <p>"We shall be quite all right now, Don, thank you," he said. "The way is
  clear enough. Now, you and your men had better get out, and we will tell you
  where to find that which is lost. You tell him, Mrs. Vansittart."</p>

  <p>There was a pleasant smile on the little actress's face and a sparkle of
  amusement in her eyes as she leant forward and addressed the man standing on
  the bank.</p>

  <p>"You won't have very far to look," she said sweetly. "You'll find your two
  cases of whisky hidden away in the storeroom behind other empty cases; and,
  as to the quinine, it is packed up in blue paper parcels and mixed with your
  sugar rations. You'll know it by the taste easily enough. You see, we hadn't
  any time to hide the stuff anywhere else, and we knew perfectly well that the
  storeroom was the last place where you would look for it. Good-bye, Don
  Miguel del Carados, good-bye, and, if we ever meet again, then I'll probably
  stand in the witness-box and give evidence against you. You don't look
  particularly happy now, and you'll look less happy still when an American
  gunboat comes nosing up the river, asking awkward questions."</p>

  <p>Del Carados, from the bank, made a profound bow in his best Spanish
  manner, but the smile on his face was a sickly one, and the language that he
  used under his breath is, perhaps, best left to the imagination.</p><br>
