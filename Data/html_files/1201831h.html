  <h3>First published in <i>The Ladies' Home Journal</i>, June 1923</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">TAPPAN gazed down upon the newly-born little burro with
  something of pity and consternation. It was not a vigorous offspring of the
  redoubtable Jennie, champion of all the numberless burros he had driven in
  his desert prospecting years. He could not leave it there to die. Surely it
  was not strong enough to follow its mother. And to kill it was beyond
  him.</p>

  <p>"Poor little devil!" soliloquized Tappan. "Reckon neither Jennie nor I
  wanted it to be born...I'll have to hold up in this camp a few days. You can
  never tell what a burro will do. It might fool us an' grow strong all of a
  sudden."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Tappan left Jennie and her tiny, gray lopeared baby to
  themselves, and leisurely set about making permanent camp. The water at this
  oasis was not much to his liking, but it was drinkable, and he felt he must
  put up with it. For the rest the oasis was desirable enough as a camping
  site. Desert wanderers like Tappan favored the lonely water holes. This one
  was up under the bold brow of the Chocolate Mountains, where rocky wall met
  the desert sand, and a green patch of palo verdes and mesquites proved the
  presence of water. It had a magnificent view down a many-leagued slope of
  desert growths, across the dark belt of green and the shining strip of red
  that marked the Rio Colorado, and on to the upflung Arizona land, range
  lifting to range until the saw-toothed peaks notched the blue sky.</p>

  <p>Locked in the iron fastnesses of these desert mountains was gold. Tappan,
  if he had any calling, was a prospector. But the lure of gold did not bind
  him to this wandering life any more than the freedom of it. He had never made
  a rich strike. About the best he could ever do was to dig enough gold to
  grubstake himself for another prospecting trip into some remote corner of the
  American Desert. Tappan knew the arid Southwest from San Diego to the Pecos
  River and from Picacho on the Colorado to the Tonto Basin. Few prospectors
  had the strength and endurance of Tappan. He was a giant in build, and at
  thirty-five had never yet reached the limit of his physical force.</p>

  <p>With hammer and pick and magnifying glass Tappan scaled the bare ridges.
  He was not an expert in testing minerals. He knew he might easily pass by a
  rich vein of ore. But he did his best, sure at least that no prospector could
  get more than he out of the pursuit of gold. Tappan was more of a naturalist
  than a prospector, and more of a dreamer than either. Many were the idle
  moments that he sat staring down the vast reaches of the valleys, or watching
  some creature of the wasteland, or marveling at the vivid hues of desert
  flowers.</p>

  <p>Tappan waited two weeks at this oasis for Jennie's baby burro to grow
  strong enough to walk. And the very day that Tappan decided to break camp he
  found signs of gold at the head of a wash above the oasis. Quite by chance,
  as he was looking for his burros, he struck his pick into a place no
  different from a thousand others there, and hit into a pocket of gold. He
  cleaned out the pocket before sunset, the richer for several thousand
  dollars.</p>

  <p>"You brought me luck," said Tappan, to the little gray burro staggering
  round its mother. "Your name is Jenet. You're Tappan's burro, an' I reckon
  he'll stick to you."</p>

  <p>Jenet belied the promise of her birth. Like a weed in fertile ground she
  grew. Winter and summer Tappan patroled the sand beats from one trading post
  to another, and his burros traveled with him. Jenet had an especially good
  training. Her mother had happened to be a remarkably good burro before Tappan
  had bought her. And Tappan had patience; he found leisure to do things, and
  he had something of pride in Jenet. Whenever he happened to drop into
  Ehrenberg or Yuma, or any freighting station, some prospector always tried to
  buy Jenet. She grew as large as a medium-sized mule, and a
  three-hundred-pound pack was no load to discommode her.</p>

  <p>Tappan, in common with most lonely wanderers of the desert, talked to his
  burro. As the years passed this habit grew, until Tappan would talk to Jenet
  just to hear the sound of his voice. Perhaps that was all which kept him
  human.</p>

  <p>"Jenet, you're worthy of a happier life," Tappan would say, as he unpacked
  her after a long day's march over the barren land. "You're a ship of the
  desert. Here we are, with grub an' water, a hundred miles from any camp. An'
  what but you could have fetched me here? No horse! No mule! No man! Nothin'
  but a camel, an' so I call you ship of the desert. But for you an' your kind,
  Jenet, there'd be no prospectors, and few gold mines. Reckon the desert would
  be still an unknown waste...You're a great beast of burden, Jenet, an'
  there's no one to sing your praise."</p>

  <p>And of a golden sunrise, when Jenet was packed and ready to face the cool,
  sweet fragrance of the desert, Tappan was wont to say:</p>

  <p>"Go along with you, Jenet. The mornin's fine. Look at the mountains yonder
  callin' us. It's only a step down there. All purple an' violet! It's the life
  for us, my burro, an' Tappan's as rich as if all these sands were
  pearls."</p>

  <p>But sometimes, at sunset, when the way had been long and hot and rough,
  Tappan would bend his shaggy head over Jenet, and talk in different mood.</p>

  <p>"Another day gone, Jenet, another journey ended&mdash;an' Tappan is only
  older, wearier, sicker. There's no reward for your faithfulness. I'm only a
  desert rat, livin' from hole to hole. No home! No face to see...Some sunset,
  Jenet, we'll reach the end of the trail. An' Tappan's bones will bleach in
  the sands. An' no one will know or care!"</p>

  <p>When Jenet was two years old she would have taken the blue ribbon in
  competition with all the burros of the Southwest. She was unusually large and
  strong, perfectly proportioned, sound in every particular, and practically
  tireless. But these were not the only characteristics that made prospectors
  envious of Tappan. Jenet had the common virtues of all good burros magnified
  to an unbelievable degree. Moreover, she had sense and instinct that to
  Tappan bordered on the supernatural.</p>

  <p>During these years Tappan's trail crisscrossed the mineral region of the
  Southwest. But, as always, the rich strike held aloof. It was like the pot of
  gold buried at the foot of the rainbow. Jenet knew the trails and the water
  holes better than Tappan. She could follow a trail obliterated by drifting
  sand or cut out by running water. She could scent at long distance a new
  spring on the desert or a strange water hole. She never wandered far from
  camp so that Tappan had to walk far in search of her. Wild burros, the bane
  of most prospectors, held no charm for Jenet. And she had never yet shown any
  especial liking for a tame burro. This was the strangest feature of Jenet's
  complex character. Burros were noted for their habit of pairing off, and
  forming friendships for one or more comrades. These relations were permanent.
  But Jenet still remained fancy free.</p>

  <p>Tappan scarcely realized how he relied upon this big, gray, serene beast
  of burden. Of course, when chance threw him among men of his calling he would
  brag about her. But he had never really appreciated Jenet. In his way Tappan
  was a brooding, plodding fellow, not conscious of sentiment. When he bragged
  about Jenet it was her good qualities upon which he dilated. But what he
  really liked best about her were the little things of every day.</p>

  <p>During the earlier years of her training Jenet had been a thief. She would
  pretend to be asleep for hours just to get a chance to steal something out of
  camp. Tappan had broken this habit in its incipiency. But he never quite
  trusted her. Jenet was a burro.</p>

  <p>Jenet ate anything offered her. She could fare for herself or go without.
  Whatever Tappan had left from his own meals was certain to be rich dessert
  for Jenet. Every meal time she would stand near the camp fire, with one great
  long ear drooping, and the other standing erect. Her expression was one of
  meekness, of unending patience. She would lick a tin can until it shone
  resplendent. On long, hard, barren trails Jenet's deportment did not vary
  from that where the water holes and grassy patches were many. She did not
  need to have grass or grain. Brittle-bush and sage were good fare for her.
  She could eat greasewood, a desert plant that protected itself with a sap as
  sticky as varnish and far more dangerous to animals. She could eat cacti.
  Tappan had seen her break off leaves of the prickly pear cactus, and stamp
  upon them with her forefeet, mashing off the thorns, so that she could
  consume the succulent pulp. She liked mesquite beans, and leaves of willow,
  and all the trailing vines of the desert. And she could subsist in an arid
  waste land where a man would have died in short order.</p>

  <p>No ascent or descent was too hard or dangerous for Jenet, provided it was
  possible of accomplishment. She would refuse a trail that was impassable. She
  seemed to have an uncanny instinct both for what she could do, and what was
  beyond a burro. Tappan had never known her to fail on something to which she
  stuck persistently. Swift streams of water, always bugbears to burros, did
  not stop Jenet. She hated quicksand, but could be trusted to navigate it, if
  that were possible. When she stepped gingerly, with little inch steps, out
  upon thin crust of ice or salty crust of desert sink hole, Tappan would know
  that it was safe, or she would turn back. Thunder and lightning, intense heat
  or bitter cold, the sirocco sand storm of the desert, the white dust of the
  alkali wastes&mdash;these were all the same to Jenet.</p>

  <p>One August, the hottest and driest of his desert experience, Tappan found
  himself working a most promising claim in the lower reaches of the Panamint
  Mountains on the northern slope above Death Valley. It was a hard country at
  the most favorable season; in August it was terrible.</p>

  <p>The Panamints were infested by various small gangs of
  desperadoes&mdash;outlaw claim jumpers where opportunity afforded&mdash;and
  out-and-out robbers, even murderers where they could not get the gold any
  other way.</p>

  <p>Tappan had been warned not to go into this region alone. But he never
  heeded any warnings. And the idea that he would ever strike a claim or dig
  enough gold to make himself an attractive target for outlaws seemed
  preposterous and not worth considering. Tappan had become a wanderer now from
  the unbreakable habit of it. Much to his amaze he struck a rich ledge of free
  gold in a canyon of the Panamints; and he worked from daylight until dark. He
  forgot about the claim jumpers, until one day he saw Jenet's long ears go up
  in the manner habitual with her when she saw strange men. Tappan watched the
  rest of that day, but did not catch a glimpse of any living thing. It was a
  desolate place, shut in, red- walled, hazy with heat, and brooding with an
  eternal silence.</p>

  <p>Not long after that Tappan discovered boot tracks of several men adjacent
  to his camp and in an out-of-the-way spot, which persuaded him that he was
  being watched. Claim jumpers who were not going to jump his claim in this
  torrid heat, but meant to let him dig the gold and then kill him. Tappan was
  not the kind of man to be afraid. He grew wrathful and stubborn. He had six
  small canvas bags of gold and did not mean to lose them. Still, he was
  worried.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's best to do?" he pondered. "I mustn't give it away that I'm
  wise. Reckon I'd better act natural. But I can't stay here longer. My claim's
  about worked out. An' these jumpers are smart enough to know it...I've got to
  make a break at night. What to do?"</p>

  <p>Tappan did not want to cache the gold, for in that case, of course, he
  would have to return for it. Still, he reluctantly admitted to himself that
  this was the best way to save it. Probably these robbers were watching him
  day and night. It would be most unwise to attempt escaping by traveling up
  over the Panamints.</p>

  <p>"Reckon my only chance is goin' down into Death Valley," soliloquized
  Tappan, grimly.</p>

  <p>The alternative thus presented was not to his liking. Crossing Death
  Valley at this season was always perilous, and never attempted in the heat of
  day. And at this particular time of intense torridity, when the day heat was
  unendurable and the midnight furnace gales were blowing, it was an enterprise
  from which even Tappan shrank. Added to this were the facts that he was too
  far west of the narrow part of the valley, and even if he did get across he
  would find himself in the most forbidding and desolate region of the Funeral
  Mountains.</p>

  <p>Thus thinking and planning, Tappan went about his mining and camp tasks,
  trying his best to act natural. But he did not succeed. It was impossible,
  while expecting a shot at any moment, to act as if there was nothing on his
  mind. His camp lay at the bottom of a rocky slope. A tiny spring of water
  made verdure of grass and mesquite, welcome green in all that stark iron
  nakedness. His camp site was out in the open, on the bench near the spring.
  The gold claim that Tappan was working was not visible from any vantage point
  either below or above. It lay back at the head of a break in the rocky wall.
  It had two virtues&mdash;one that the sun never got to it, and the other that
  it was well hidden. Once there, Tappan knew he could not be seen. This,
  however, did not diminish his growing uneasiness. The solemn stillness was a
  menace. The heat of the day appeared to be augmenting to a degree beyond his
  experience. Every few moments Tappan would slip back through a narrow defile
  in the rocks and peep from his covert down at the camp. On the last of these
  occasions he saw Jenet out in the open. She stood motionless. Her long ears
  were erect. In an instant Tappan became strung with thrilling excitement. His
  keen eyes searched every approach to his camp. And at last in the gully below
  to the right he discovered two men crawling along from rock to rock. Jenet
  had seen them enter that gully and was now watching for them to appear.</p>

  <p>Tappan's excitement gave place to a grimmer emotion. These stealthy
  visitors were going to hide in ambush, and kill him as he returned to
  camp.</p>

  <p>"Jenet, reckon what I owe you is a whole lot," muttered Tappan. "They'd
  have got me sure...But now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tappan left his tools, and crawled out of his covert into the jumble of
  huge rocks toward the left of the slope. He had a six-shooter. His rifle he
  had left in camp. Tappan had seen only two men, but he knew there were more
  than that, if not actually near at hand at the moment, then surely not far
  away. And his chance was to worm his way like an Indian down to camp. With
  the rifle in his possession he would make short work of the present
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Lucky Jenet's right in camp!" said Tappan, to himself. "It beats hell how
  she does things!"</p>

  <p>Tappan was already deciding to pack and hurry away. On the moment Death
  Valley did not daunt him. This matter of crawling and gliding along was work
  unsuited to his great stature. He was too big to hide behind a little shrub
  or a rock. And he was not used to stepping lightly. His hobnailed boots could
  not be placed noiselessly upon the stones. Moreover, he could not progress
  without displacing little bits of weathered rock. He was sure that keen ears
  not too far distant could have heard him. But he kept on, making good
  progress around that slope to the far side of the canyon. Fortunately, he
  headed the gully up which his ambushers were stealing. On the other hand,
  this far side of the canyon afforded but little cover. The sun had gone down
  back of the huge red mass of the mountain. It had left the rocks so hot
  Tappan could not touch them with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>He was about to stride out from his last covert and make a run for it down
  the rest of the slope, when, surveying the whole amphitheater below him, he
  espied the two men coming up out of the gully, headed toward his camp. They
  looked in his direction. Surely they had heard or seen him. But Tappan
  perceived at a glance that he was the closer to the camp. Without another
  moment of hesitation, he plunged from his hiding place, down the weathered
  slope. His giant strides set the loose rocks sliding and rattling. The men
  saw him. The foremost yelled to the one behind him. Then they both broke into
  a run. Tappan reached the level of the bench, and saw he could beat either of
  them into the camp. Unless he were disabled! He felt the wind of a heavy
  bullet before he heard it strike the rocks beyond. Then followed the boom of
  a Colt. One of his enemies had halted to shoot. This spurred Tappan to
  tremendous exertion. He flew over the rough ground, scarcely hearing the
  rapid shots. He could no longer see the man who was firing. But the first one
  was in plain sight, running hard, not yet seeing he was out of the race.</p>

  <p>When he became aware of that he halted, and dropping on one knee, leveled
  his gun at the running Tappan. The distance was scarcely sixty yards. His
  first shot did not allow for Tappan's speed. His second kicked up the gravel
  in Tappan's face. Then followed three more shots in rapid succession. The man
  divined that Tappan had a rifle in camp. Then he steadied himself, waiting
  for the moment when Tappan had to slow down and halt. As Tappan reached his
  camp and dove for his rifle, the robber took time for his last aim, evidently
  hoping to get a stationary target. But Tappan did not get up from behind his
  camp duffel. It had been a habit of his to pile his boxes of supplies and
  roll of bedding together, and cover them with a canvas. He poked his rifle
  over the top of this and shot the robber.</p>

  <p>Then, leaping up, he ran forward to get sight of the second one. This man
  began to run along the edge of the gully. Tappan fired rapidly at him. The
  third shot knocked the fellow down. But he got up, and yelling, as if for
  succor, he ran off. Tappan got another shot before he disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Ahuh!" grunted Tappan, grimly. His keen gaze came back to survey the
  fallen robber, and then went out over the bench, across the wide mouth of the
  canyon. Tappan thought he had better utilize time to pack instead of pursuing
  the fleeing man.</p>

  <p>Reloading the rifle, he hurried out to find Jenet. She was coming in to
  camp.</p>

  <p>"Shore you're a treasure, old girl!" ejaculated Tappan.</p>

  <p>Never in his life had he packed Jenet, or any other burro, so quickly. His
  last act was to drink all he could hold, fill his two canteens, and make
  Jenet drink. Then, rifle in hand, he drove the burro out of camp, round the
  corner of the red wall, to the wide gateway that opened down into Death
  Valley.</p>

  <p>Tappan looked back more than he looked ahead. And he had traveled down a
  mile or more before he began to breathe more easily. He had escaped the claim
  jumpers. Even if they did show up in pursuit now, they could never catch him.
  Tappan believed he could travel faster and farther than any men of that ilk.
  But they did not appear. Perhaps the crippled one had not been able to reach
  his comrades in time. More likely, however, the gang had no taste for a chase
  in that torrid heat.</p>

  <p>Tappan slowed his stride. He was almost as wet with sweat as if he had
  fallen into the spring. The great beads rolled down his face. And there
  seemed to be little streams of fire trickling down his breast. But despite
  this, and his labored panting for breath, not until he halted in the shade of
  a rocky wall did he realize the heat.</p>

  <p>It was terrific. Instantly then he knew he was safe from pursuit. But he
  knew also that he faced a greater peril than that of robbers. He could fight
  evil men, but he could not fight this heat.</p>

  <p>So he rested there, regaining his breath. Already thirst was acute. Jenet
  stood near by, watching him. Tappan, with his habit of humanizing the burro,
  imagined that Jenet looked serious. A moment's thought was enough for Tappan
  to appreciate the gravity of his situation. He was about to go down into the
  upper end of Death Valley&mdash;a part of that country unfamiliar to him. He
  must cross it, and also the Funeral Mountains, at a season when a prospector
  who knew the trails and water holes would have to be forced to undertake it.
  Tappan had no choice.</p>

  <p>His rifle was too hot to hold, so he stuck it in Jenet's pack; and,
  burdened only by a canteen of water, he set out, driving the burro ahead.
  Once he looked back up the wide-mouthed canyon. It appeared to smoke with red
  heat veils. The silence was oppressive.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned the last corner that obstructed sight of Death Valley.
  Tappan had never been appalled by any aspect of the desert, but it was
  certain that here he halted. Back in his mountain-walled camp the sun had
  passed behind the high domes, but here it still held most of the valley in
  its blazing grip. Death Valley looked a ghastly, glaring level of white, over
  which a strange dull leaden haze drooped like a blanket. Ghosts of mountain
  peaks appeared to show dim and vague. There was no movement of anything. No
  wind! The valley was dead. Desolation reigned supreme. Tappan could not see
  far toward either end of the valley. A few miles of white glare merged at
  last into leaden pall. A strong odor, not unlike sulphur, seemed to add
  weight to the air.</p>

  <p>Tappan strode on, mindful that Jenet had decided opinions of her own. She
  did not want to go straight ahead or to right or left, but back. That was the
  one direction impossible for Tappan. And he had to resort to a rare
  measure&mdash;that of beating her. But at last Jenet accepted the inevitable
  and headed down into the stark and naked plain. Soon Tappan reached the
  margin of the zone of shade cast by the mountain and was now exposed to the
  sun. The difference seemed tremendous. He had been hot, oppressed, weighted.
  It was now as if he was burned through his clothes, and walked on red-hot
  sands.</p>

  <p>When Tappan ceased to sweat and his skin became dry, he drank half a
  canteen of water, and slowed his stride. Inured to desert hardship as he was,
  he could not long stand this. Jenet did not exhibit any lessening of vigor.
  In truth what she showed now was an increasing nervousness. It was almost as
  if she scented an enemy. Tappan never before had such faith in her. Jenet was
  equal to this task.</p>

  <p>With that blazing sun on his back, Tappan felt he was being pursued by a
  furnace. He was compelled to drink the remaining half of his first canteen of
  water. Sunset would save him. Two more hours of such insupportable heat would
  lay him prostrate.</p>

  <p>The ghastly glare of the valley took on a reddish tinge. The heat was
  blinding Tappan. The time came when he walked beside Jenet with a hand on her
  pack, for his eyes could no longer endure the furnace glare. Even with them
  closed he knew when the sun sank behind the Panamints. That fire no longer
  followed him. And the red left his eyelids.</p>

  <p>With the sinking of the sun the world of Death Valley changed. It smoked
  with heat veils. But the intolerable constant burn was gone. The change was
  so immense that it seemed to have brought coolness.</p>

  <p>In the twilight&mdash;strange, ghostly, somber, silent as
  death&mdash;Tappan followed Jenet off the sand, down upon the silt and borax
  level, to the crusty salt. Before dark Jenet halted at a sluggish belt of
  fluid&mdash;acid, it appeared to Tappan. It was not deep. And the bottom felt
  stable. But Jenet refused to cross. Tappan trusted her judgment more than his
  own. Jenet headed to the left and followed the course of the strange
  stream.</p>

  <p>Night intervened. A night without stars or sky or sound, hot, breathless,
  charged with some intangible current! Tappan dreaded the midnight furnace
  winds of Death Valley. He had never encountered them. He had heard
  prospectors say that any man caught in Death Valley when these gales blew
  would never get out to tell the tale. And Jenet seemed to have something on
  her mind. She was no longer a leisurely, complacent burro. Tappan imagined
  Jenet seemed stern. Most assuredly she knew now which way she wanted to
  travel. It was not easy for Tappan to keep up with her, and ten paces beyond
  him she was out of sight.</p>

  <p>At last Jenet headed the acid wash, and turned across the valley into a
  field of broken salt crust, like the roughened ice of a river that had broken
  and jammed, then frozen again. Impossible was it to make even a reasonable
  headway. It was a zone, however, that eventually gave way to Jenet's instinct
  for direction. Tappan had long ceased to try to keep his bearings. North,
  south, east, and west were all the same to him. The night was a
  blank&mdash;the darkness a wall&mdash;the silence a terrible menace flung at
  any living creature. Death Valley had endured them millions of years before
  living creatures had existed. It was no place for a man.</p>

  <p>Tappan was now three hundred and more feet below sea level, in the
  aftermath of a day that had registered one hundred and forty-five degrees of
  heat. He knew, when he began to lose thought and balance&mdash;when only the
  primitive instincts directed his bodily machine. And he struggled with all
  his will power to keep hold of his sense of sight and feeling. He hoped to
  cross the lower level before the midnight gales began to blow.</p>

  <p>Tappan's hope was vain. According to record, once in a long season of
  intense heat, there came a night when the furnace winds broke their schedule,
  and began early. The misfortune of Tappan was that he had struck this
  night.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed that the air, sodden with heat, began to move. It had
  weight. It moved soundlessly and ponderously. But it gathered momentum.
  Tappan realized what was happening. The blanket of heat generated by the day
  was yielding to outside pressure. Something had created a movement of the
  hotter air that must find its way upward, to give place for the cooler air
  that must find its way down.</p>

  <p>Tappan heard the first, low, distant moan of wind and it struck terror to
  his heart. It did not have an earthly sound. Was that a knell for him?
  Nothing was surer than the fact that the desert must sooner or later claim
  him as a victim. Grim and strong, he rebelled against the conviction.</p>

  <p>That moan was a forerunner of others, growing louder and longer until the
  weird sound became continuous. Then the movement of wind was accelerated and
  began to carry a fine dust. Dark as the night was, it did not hide the pale
  sheets of dust that moved along the level plain. Tappan's feet felt the slow
  rise in the floor of the valley. His nose recognized the zone of borax and
  alkali and niter and sulphur. He had reached the pit of the valley at the
  time of the furnace winds.</p>

  <p>The moan augmented to a roar, coming like a mighty storm through a forest.
  It was hellish&mdash;like the woeful tide of Acheron. It enveloped Tappan.
  And the gale bore down in tremendous volume, like a furnace blast. Tappan
  seemed to feel his body penetrated by a million needles of fire. He seemed to
  dry up. The blackness of night had a spectral, whitish cast; the gloom was a
  whirling medium; the valley floor was lost in a sheeted, fiercely seeping
  stream of silt. Deadly fumes swept by, not lingering long enough to suffocate
  Tappan. He would gasp and choke&mdash;then the poison gas was gone on the
  gale. But hardest to endure was the heavy body of moving heat. Tappan grew
  blind, so that he had to hold to Jenet, and stumble along. Every gasping
  breath was a tortured effort. He could not bear a scarf over his face. His
  lungs heaved like great leather bellows. His heart pumped like an engine
  short of fuel. This was the supreme test for his never proven endurance. And
  he was all but vanquished.</p>

  <p>Tappan's senses of sight and smell and hearing failed him. There was left
  only the sense of touch&mdash;a feeling of rope and burro and
  ground&mdash;and an awful insulating pressure upon all his body. His feet
  marked a change from salty plain to sandy ascent and then to rocky slope. The
  pressure of wind gradually lessened: the difference in air made life
  possible; the feeling of being dragged endlessly by Jenet had ceased. Tappan
  went his limit and fell into oblivion.</p>

  <p>When he came to, he was suffering bodily tortures. Sight was dim. But he
  saw walls of rocks, green growths of mesquite, tamarack, and grass. Jenet was
  lying down, with her pack flopped to one side. Tappan's dead ears recovered
  to a strange murmuring, babbling sound. Then he realized his deliverance.
  Jenet had led him across Death Valley, up into the mountain range, straight
  to a spring of running water.</p>

  <p>Tappan crawled to the edge of the water and drank guardedly, a little at a
  time. He had to quell terrific craving to drink his fill. Then he crawled to
  Jenet, and loosening the ropes of her pack, freed her from its burden. Jenet
  got up, apparently none the worse for her ordeal. She gazed mildly at Tappan,
  as if to say: "Well, I got you out of that hole."</p>

  <p>Tappan returned her gaze. Were they only man and beast, alone in the
  desert? She seemed magnified to Tappan, no longer a plodding, stupid
  burro.</p>

  <p>This was the supreme test for his never proven endurance. And he was all
  but vanquished.</p><a id="ill-02"

  </div><br>

  <p>"Jenet, you&mdash;saved&mdash;my life," Tappan tried to enunciate. "I'll
  never&mdash;forget."</p>

  <p>Tappan was struck then to a realization of Jenet's service. He was
  unutterably grateful. Yet the time came when he did forget.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>Tappan had a weakness common to all prospectors: Any tale of a lost gold
  mine would excite his interest; and well-known legends of lost mines always
  obsessed him.</p>

  <p>Peg-leg Smith's lost gold mine had lured Tappan to no less than half a
  dozen trips into the terrible shifting-sand country of southern California.
  There was no water near the region said to hide this mine of fabulous wealth.
  Many prospectors had left their bones to bleach white in the sun, finally to
  be buried by the ever blowing sands. Upon the occasion of Tappan's last
  escape from this desolate and forbidding desert, he had promised Jenet never
  to undertake it again. It seemed Tappan promised the faithful burro a good
  many things. It had been a habit.</p>

  <p>When Tappan had a particularly hard experience or perilous adventure, he
  always took a dislike to the immediate country where it had befallen him.
  Jenet had dragged him across Death Valley, through incredible heat and the
  midnight furnace winds of that strange place; and he had promised her he
  would never forget how she had saved his life. Nor would he ever go back to
  Death Valley! He made his way over the Funeral Mountains, worked down through
  Nevada, and crossed the Rio Colorado above Needles, and entered Arizona. He
  traveled leisurely, but he kept going, and headed southeast towards Globe.
  There he cashed one of his six bags of gold, and indulged in the luxury of a
  complete new outfit. Even Jenet appreciated this fact, for the old outfit
  would scarcely hold together.</p>

  <p>Tappan had the other five bags of gold in his pack; and after hours of
  hesitation he decided he would not cash them and entrust the money to a bank.
  He would take care of them. For him the value of this gold amounted to a
  small fortune. Many plans suggested themselves to Tappan. But in the end he
  grew weary of them. What did he want with a ranch, or cattle, or an
  outfitting store, or any of the businesses he now had the means to buy? Towns
  soon palled on Tappan. People did not long please him. Selfish interest and
  greed seemed paramount everywhere. Besides, if he acquired a place to take up
  his time, what would become of Jenet? That question decided him. He packed
  the burro and once more took to the trails.</p>

  <p>A dim, lofty, purple range called alluringly to Tappan. The Superstition
  Mountains! Somewhere in that purple mass hid the famous treasure called the
  Lost Dutchman gold mine. Tappan had heard the story often. A Dutch prospector
  struck gold in the Superstitions. He kept the location secret. When he ran
  short of money, he would disappear for a few weeks, and then return with bags
  of gold. Wherever his strike, it assuredly was a rich one. No one ever could
  trail him or get a word out of him. Time passed. A few years made him old.
  During this time he conceived a liking for a young man, and eventually
  confided to him that some day he would tell him the secret of his gold mine.
  He had drawn a map of the landmarks adjacent to his mine. But he was careful
  not to put on paper directions how to get there. It chanced that he suddenly
  fell ill and saw his end was near. Then he summoned the young man who had
  been so fortunate as to win his regard. Now this individual was a
  ne'er-do-well, and upon this occasion he was half drunk. The dying Dutchman
  produced his map, and gave it with verbal directions to the young man. Then
  he died. When the recipient of this fortune recovered from the effects of
  liquor, he could not remember all the Dutchman had told him. He tortured
  himself to remember names and places. But the mine was up in the Superstition
  Mountains. He never remembered. He never found the lost mine, though he spent
  his life and died trying. Thus the story passed into the legend of the Lost
  Dutchman.</p>

  <p>Tappan now had his try at finding it. But for him the shifting sands of
  the southern California desert or even the barren and desolate Death Valley
  were preferable to this Superstition Range. It was a harder country than the
  Pinacate of Sonora. Tappan hated cactus, and the Superstitions were full of
  it. Everywhere stood up the huge sahuaro, the giant cacti of the Arizona
  plateaus, tall like branchless trees, fluted and columnar, beautiful and
  fascinating to gaze upon, but obnoxious to prospector and burro.</p>

  <p>One day from a north slope Tappan saw afar a wonderful country of black
  timber, above which zigzagged for many miles a yellow, winding rampart of
  rock. This he took to be the rim of the Mogollon Mesa, one of Arizona's
  freaks of nature. Something called Tappan. He was forever victim to yearnings
  for the unattainable. He was tired of heat, glare, dust, bare rock, and
  thorny cactus. The Lost Dutchman gold mine was a myth. Besides, he did not
  need any more gold.</p>

  <p>Next morning Tappan packed Jenet and worked down off the north slopes of
  the Superstition Range. That night about sunset he made camp on the bank of a
  clear brook, with grass and wood in abundance&mdash;such a camp site as a
  prospector dreamed of but seldom found.</p>

  <p>Before dark Jenet's long ears told of the advent of strangers. A man and a
  woman rode down the trail into Tappan's camp. They had poor horses, and led a
  pack animal that appeared too old and weak to bear up under even the meager
  pack he carried.</p>

  <p>"Howdy!" said the man.</p>

  <p>Tappan rose from his task to his lofty height and returned the greeting.
  The man was middle-aged, swarthy, and rugged, a mountaineer, with something
  about him that Tappan instinctively distrusted. The woman was under thirty,
  comely in a full-blown way, with rich brown skin and glossy dark hair. She
  had wide-open black eyes that bent a curious possession-taking gaze upon
  Tappan.</p>

  <p>"Care if we camp with you?" she inquired, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>That smile changed Tappan's habit and conviction of a lifetime.</p>

  <p>"No indeed. Reckon I'd like a little company," he said.</p>

  <p>Very probably Jenet did not understand Tappan's words, but she dropped one
  ear, and walked out of camp to the green bank.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, stranger," replied the woman. "That grub shore smells good." She
  hesitated a moment, evidently waiting to catch her companion's eye, then she
  continued. "My name's Madge Beam. He's my brother Jake...Who might you happen
  to be?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Tappan, lone prospector, as you see," replied Tappan.</p>

  <p>"Tappan! What's your front handle?" she queried, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Fact is, I don't remember," replied Tappan, as he brushed a huge hand
  through his shaggy hair.</p>

  <p>"Ahuh? Any name's good enough."</p>

  <p>When she dismounted, Tappan saw that she had a tall, lithe figure, garbed
  in rider's overalls and boots. She unsaddled her horse with the dexterity of
  long practice. The saddlebags she carried over to the spot the man Jake had
  selected to throw the pack.</p>

  <p>Tappan heard them talking in low tones. It struck him as strange that he
  did not have his usual reaction to an invasion of his privacy and solitude.
  Tappan had thrilled under those black eyes. And now a queer sensation of the
  unusual rose in him. Bending over his camp-fire tasks he pondered this and
  that, but mostly the sense of the nearness of a woman. Like most desert men,
  Tappan knew little of the other sex. A few that he might have been drawn to
  went out of his wandering life as quickly as they had entered it. This Madge
  Beam took possession of his thoughts. An evidence of Tappan's preoccupation
  was the fact that he burned his first batch of biscuits. And Tappan felt
  proud of his culinary ability. He was on his knees, mixing more flour and
  water, when the woman spoke from right behind him.</p>

  <p>"Tough luck you burned the first pan," she said. "But it's a good turn for
  your burro. That shore is a burro. Biggest I ever saw."</p>

  <p>She picked up the burned biscuits and tossed them over to Jenet. Then she
  came back to Tappan's side, rather embarrassingly close.</p>

  <p>"Tappan, I know how I'll eat, so I ought to ask you to let me help," she
  said, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't need any," replied Tappan. "You sit down on my roll of
  beddin' there. Must be tired, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not so very," she returned. "That is, I'm not tired of ridin'." She spoke
  the second part of this reply in lower tone.</p>

  <p>Tappan looked up from his task. The woman had washed her face, brushed her
  hair, and had put on a skirt&mdash;a singularly attractive change. Tappan
  thought her younger. She was the handsomest woman he had ever seen. The look
  of her made him clumsy. What eyes she had! They looked through him. Tappan
  returned to his task, wondering if he was right in his surmise that she
  wanted to be friendly.</p>

  <p>"Jake an' I drove a bunch of cattle to Maricopa," she volunteered. "We
  sold 'em, an' Jake gambled away most of the money. I couldn't get what I
  wanted."</p>

  <p>"Too bad! So you're ranchers. Once thought I'd like that. Fact is, down
  here at Globe a few weeks ago I came near buyin' some rancher out an' tryin'
  the game."</p>

  <p>"You did?" Her query had a low, quick eagerness that somehow thrilled
  Tappan. But he did not look up.</p>

  <p>"I'm a wanderer. I'd never do on a ranch."</p>

  <p>"But if you had a woman?" Her laugh was subtle and gay.</p>

  <p>"A woman! For me? Oh, Lord, no!" ejaculated Tappan, in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Are you a woman hater?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that," replied Tappan, soberly. "It's just&mdash;I
  guess&mdash;no woman would have me."</p>

  <p>"Faint heart never won fair lady."</p>

  <p>Tappan had no reply for that. He surely was making a mess of the second
  pan of biscuit dough. Manifestly the woman saw this, for with a laugh she
  plumped down on her knees in front of Tappan, and rolled her sleeves up over
  shapely brown arms.</p>

  <p>"Poor man! Shore you need a woman. Let me show you," she said, and put her
  hands right down upon Tappan's. The touch gave him a strange thrill. He had
  to pull his hands away, and as he wiped them with his scarf he looked at her.
  He seemed compelled to look. She was close to him now, smiling in good
  nature, a little scornful of man's encroachment upon the housewifely duties
  of a woman. A subtle something emanated from her&mdash;a more than kindness
  or gayety. Tappan grasped that it was just the woman of her. And it was going
  to his head.</p>

  <p>"Very well, let's see you show me," he replied, as he rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>Just then the brother Jake strolled over, and he had a rather amused and
  derisive eye for his sister.</p>

  <p>"Wal, Tappan, she's not overfond of work, but I reckon she can cook," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Tappan felt greatly relieved at the approach of this brother. And he fell
  into conversation with him, telling something of his prospecting since
  leaving Globe, and listening to the man's cattle talk. By and by the woman
  called, "Come an' get it!" Then they sat down to eat, and, as usual with
  hungry wayfarers, they did not talk much until appetite was satisfied.
  Afterward, before the camp fire, they began to talk again, Jake being the
  most discursive. Tappan conceived the idea that the rancher was rather
  curious about him, and perhaps wanted to sell his ranch. The woman seemed
  more thoughtful, with her wide black eyes on the fire.</p>

  <p>"Tappan, what way you travelin'?" finally inquired Beam.</p>

  <p>"Can't say. I just worked down out of the Superstitions. Haven't any place
  in mind. Where does this road go?"</p>

  <p>"To the Tonto Basin. Ever heard of it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the name isn't new. What's in this Basin?"</p>

  <p>The man grunted. "Tonto once was home for the Apache. It's now got a few
  sheep an' cattlemen, lots of rustlers. An' say, if you like to hunt bear an'
  deer, come along with us." &gt;</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I don't know as I can," returned Tappan, irresolutely. He was not
  used to such possibilities as this suggested.</p>

  <p>Then the woman spoke up. "It's a pretty country. Wild an' different. We
  live up under the rim rock. There's mineral in the canyons."</p>

  <p>Was it that about mineral which decided Tappan or the look in her
  eyes?</p>

  <p>Tappan's world of thought and feeling underwent as great a change as this
  Tonto Basin differed from the stark desert so long his home. The trail to the
  log cabin of the Beams climbed many a ridge and slope and foothill, all
  covered with manzanita, mescal, cedar, and juniper, at last to reach the
  canyons of the Rim, where lofty pines and spruces lorded it over the under
  forest of maples and oaks. Though the yellow Rim towered high over the site
  of the cabin, the altitude was still great, close to seven thousand feet
  above sea level.</p>

  <p>Tappan had fallen in love with this wild wooded and canyoned country. So
  had Jenet. It was rather funny the way she hung around Tappan, mornings and
  evenings. She ate luxuriant grass and oak leaves until her sides bulged.</p>

  <p>There did not appear to be any flat places in this landscape. Every bench
  was either up hill or down hill. The Beams had no garden or farm or ranch
  that Tappan could discover. They raised a few acres of sorghum and corn.
  Their log cabin was of the most primitive kind, and outfitted poorly. Madge
  Beam explained that this cabin was their winter abode, and that up on the Rim
  they had a good house and ranch. Tappan did not inquire closely into
  anything. If he had interrogated himself, he would have found out that the
  reason he did not inquire was because he feared something might remove him
  from the vicinity of Madge Beam. He had thought it strange the Beams avoided
  wayfarers they had met on the trail, and had gone round a little hamlet
  Tappan had espied from a hill. Madge Beam, with woman's intuition, had read
  his mind, and had said: "Jake doesn't get along so well with some of the
  villagers. An' I've no hankerin' for gun play." That explanation was
  sufficient for Tappan. He had lived long enough in his wandering years to
  appreciate that people could have reasons for being solitary.</p>

  <p>This trip up into the Rim Rock country bade fair to become Tappan's one
  and only adventure of the heart. It was not alone the murmuring, clear brook
  of cold mountain water that enchanted him, nor the stately pines, nor the
  beautiful silver spruces, nor the wonder of the deep, yellow-walled canyons,
  so choked with verdure, and haunted by wild creatures. He dared not face his
  soul, and ask why this dark-eyed woman sought him more and more. Tappan lived
  in the moment.</p>

  <p>He was aware that the few mountaineer neighbors who rode that way rather
  avoided contact with him. Tappan was not so dense that he did not perceive
  that the Beams preferred to keep him from outsiders. This perhaps was owing
  to their desire to sell Tappan the ranch and cattle. Jake offered to let it
  go at what he called a low figure. Tappan thought it just as well to go out
  into the forest and hide his bags of gold. He did not trust Jake Beam, and
  liked less the looks of the men who visited this wilderness ranch. Madge Beam
  might be related to a rustler, and the associate of rustlers, but that did
  not necessarily make her a bad woman. Tappan sensed that her attitude was
  changing, and she seemed to require his respect. At first, all she wanted was
  his admiration. Tappan's long unused deference for women returned to him, and
  when he saw that it was having some strange softening effect upon Madge Beam,
  he redoubled his attentions. They rode and climbed and hunted together.
  Tappan had pitched his camp not far from the cabin, on a shaded bank of the
  singing brook. Madge did not leave him much to himself. She was always coming
  up to his camp, on one pretext or another. Often she would bring two horses,
  and make Tappan ride with her. Some of these occasions, Tappan saw, occurred
  while visitors came to the cabin. In three weeks Madge Beam changed from the
  bold and careless woman who had ridden down into his camp that sunset, to a
  serious and appealing woman, growing more careful of her person and
  adornment, and manifestly bearing a burden on her mind.</p>

  <p>October came. In the morning white frost glistened on the split-wood
  shingles of the cabin. The sun soon melted it, and grew warm. The afternoons
  were still and smoky, melancholy with the enchantment of Indian summer.
  Tappan hunted wild turkey and deer with Madge, and revived his boyish love of
  such pursuits. Madge appeared to be a woman of the woods, and had no mean
  skill with the rifle.</p>

  <p>One day they were high on the Rim, with the great timbered basin at their
  feet. They had come up to hunt deer, but got no farther than the wonderful
  promontory where before they had lingered.</p>

  <p>"Somethin' will happen to me to-day," Madge Beam said, enigmatically.</p>

  <p>Tappan never had been much of a talker. But he could listen. The woman
  unburdened herself this day. She wanted freedom, happiness, a home away from
  this lonely country, and all the heritage of woman. She confessed it
  broodingly, passionately. And Tappan recognized truth when he heard it. He
  was ready to do all in his power for this woman and believed she knew it. But
  words and acts of sentiment came hard to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you goin' to buy Jake's ranch?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Is there any hurry?" returned Tappan.</p>

  <p>"I reckon not. But I think I'll settle that," she said, decisively.</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Jake hasn't got any ranch," she answered. And added hastily, "No
  clear title, I mean. He's only homesteaded one hundred an' sixty acres, an'
  hasn't proved up on it yet. But don't you say I told you."</p>

  <p>"Was Jake aimin' to be crooked?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon...An' I was willin' at first. But not now."</p>

  <p>Tappan did not speak at once. He saw the woman was in one of her brooding
  moods. Besides, he wanted to weigh her words. How significant they were!
  To-day more than ever she had let down. Humility and simplicity seemed to
  abide with her. And her brooding boded a storm. Tappan's heart swelled in his
  broad breast. Was life going to dawn rosy and bright for the lonely
  prospector? He had money to make a home for this woman. What lay in the
  balance of the hour? Tappan waited, slowly realizing the charged
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Madge's somber eyes gazed out over the great void. But, full of thought
  and passion as they were, they did not see the beauty of that scene. But
  Tappan saw it. And in some strange sense the color and wildness and sublimity
  seemed the expression of a new state of his heart. Under him sheered down the
  ragged and cracked cliffs of the Rim, yellow and gold and gray, full of caves
  and crevices, ledges for eagles and niches for lions, a thousand feet down to
  the upward edge of the long green slopes and canyons, and so on down and down
  into the abyss of forested ravine and ridge, rolling league on league away to
  the encompassing barrier of purple mountain ranges.</p>

  <p>The thickets in the canyons called Tappan's eye back to linger there. How
  different from the scenes that used to be perpetually in his sight! What riot
  of color! The tips of the green pines, the crests of the silver spruces,
  waved about masses of vivid gold of aspen trees, and wonderful cerise and
  flaming red of maples, and crags of yellow rock, covered with the bronze of
  frostbitten sumach. Here was autumn and with it the colors of Tappan's
  favorite season. From below breathed up the low roar of plunging brook; an
  eagle screeched his wild call; an elk bugled his piercing blast. From the Rim
  wisps of pine needles blew away on the breeze and fell into the void. A wild
  country, colorful, beautiful, bountiful. Tappan imagined he could quell his
  wandering spirit here, with this dark-eyed woman by his side. Never before
  had Nature so called him. Here was not the cruelty or flinty hardness of the
  desert. The air was keen and sweet, cold in the shade, warm in the sun. A
  fragrance of balsam and spruce, spiced with pine, made his breathing a thing
  of difficulty and delight. How for so many years had he endured vast open
  spaces without such eye-soothing trees as these? Tappan's back rested against
  a huge pine that tipped the Rim, and had stood there, stronger than the
  storms, for many a hundred years. The rock of the promontory was covered with
  soft brown mats of pine needles. A juniper tree, with its bright green
  foliage and lilac-colored berries, grew near the pine, and helped to form a
  secluded little nook, fragrant and somehow haunting. The woman's dark head
  was close to Tappan, as she sat with her elbows on her knees, gazing down
  into the basin. Tappan saw the strained tensity of her posture, the heaving
  of her full bosom. He wondered, while his own emotions, so long darkened,
  roused to the suspense of that hour.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she flung herself into Tappan's arms. The act amazed him. It
  seemed to have both the passion of a woman and the shame of a girl. Before
  she hid her face on Tappan's breast he saw how the rich brown had paled, and
  then flamed.</p>

  <p>"Tappan!...Take me away...Take me away from here&mdash;from that life down
  there," she cried, in smothered voice.</p>

  <p>"Madge, you mean take you away&mdash;and marry you?" he replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;marry me, if you love me...I don't see how you
  can&mdash;but you do, don't you?&mdash;Say you do."</p>

  <p>"I reckon that's what ails me, Madge," he replied, simply.</p>

  <p>"Say so, then," she burst out.</p>

  <p>"All right, I do," said Tappan, with heavy breath. "Madge, words don't
  come easy for me...But I think you're wonderful, an' I want you. I haven't
  dared hope for that, till now. I'm only a wanderer. But it'd be heaven to
  have you&mdash;my wife&mdash;an' make a home for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Oh!" she returned, wildly, and lifted herself to cling round his
  neck, and to kiss him. "You give me joy...Oh, Tappan, I love you. I never
  loved any man before. I know now...An' I'm not wonderful&mdash;or good. But I
  love you."</p>

  <p>The fire of her lips and the clasp of her arms worked havoc in Tappan. No
  woman had ever loved him, let alone embraced him. To awake suddenly to such
  rapture as this made him strong and rough in his response. Then all at once
  she seemed to collapse in his arms and to begin to weep. He feared he had
  offended or hurt her, and was clumsy in his contrition. Presently she
  replied:</p>

  <p>"Pretty soon&mdash;I'll make you&mdash;beat me. It's your love&mdash;your
  honesty&mdash;that's shamed me...Tappan, I was party to a trick to&mdash;sell
  you a worthless ranch...I agreed to&mdash;try to make you love me&mdash;to
  fool you&mdash;cheat you...But I've fallen in love with you.&mdash;An' my
  God, I care more for your love&mdash;your respect&mdash;than for my life. I
  can't go on with it. I've double-crossed Jake, an' all of them...Now, am I
  worth lovin'? Am I worth havin'?"</p>

  <p>"More than ever, dear," he said.</p>

  <p>"You will take me away?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere&mdash;any time, the sooner the better."</p>

  <p>She kissed him passionately, and then, disengaging herself from his arms,
  she knelt and gazed earnestly at him. "I've not told all. I will some day.
  But I swear now on my soul&mdash;I'll be what you think me."</p>

  <p>"Madge, you needn't say all that. If you love me&mdash;it's enough. More
  than I ever dreamed of."</p>

  <p>"You're a man. Oh, why didn't I meet you when I was eighteen instead of
  now&mdash;twenty-eight, an' all that between...But enough. A new life begins
  here for me. We must plan."</p>

  <p>"You make the plans an' I'll act on them."</p>

  <p>For a moment she was tense and silent, head bowed, hands shut tight. Then
  she spoke:</p>

  <p>"To-night we'll slip away. You make a light pack, that'll go on your
  saddle. I'll do the same. We'll hide the horses out near where the trail
  crosses the brook. An' we'll run off&mdash;ride out of the country."</p>

  <p>Tappan in turn tried to think, but the whirl of his mind made any reason
  difficult. This dark-eyed, full-bosomed woman loved him, had surrendered
  herself, asked only his protection. The thing seemed marvelous. Yet she knelt
  there, those dark eyes on him, infinitely more appealing than ever, haunting
  with some mystery of sadness and fear he could not divine.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Tappan remembered Jenet.</p>

  <p>"I must take Jenet," he said.</p>

  <p>That startled her.</p>

  <p>"Jenet&mdash;Who's she?"</p>

  <p>"My burro."</p>

  <p>"Your burro. You can't travel fast with that pack beast. We'll be trailed,
  an' we'll have to go fast...You can't take the burro."</p>

  <p>Then Tappan was startled. "What! Can't take Jenet?&mdash;Why, I&mdash;I
  couldn't get along without her."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. What's a burro? We must ride fast&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Madge, I'm afraid I&mdash;I must take Jenet with me," he said,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible. I can't go if you take her. I tell you I've got to get
  away. If you want me you'll have to leave your precious Jenet behind."</p>

  <p>Tappan bowed his head to the inevitable. After all, Jenet was only a beast
  of burden. She would run wild on the ridges and soon forget him and have no
  need of him. Something strained in Tappan's breast. He did not see clearly
  here. This woman was worth more than all else to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm stupid, dear," he said. "You see I never before ran off with a
  beautiful woman...Of course my burro must be left behind."</p>

  <p>Elopement, if such it could be called, was easy for them. Tappan did not
  understand why Madge wanted to be so secret about it. Was she not free? But
  then, he reflected, he did not know the circumstances she feared. Besides, he
  did not care. Possession of the woman was enough.</p>

  <p>Tappan made his small pack, the weight of which was considerable owing to
  his bags of gold. This he tied on his saddle. It bothered him to leave most
  of his new outfit scattered around his camp. What would Jenet think of that?
  He looked for her, but for once she did not come in at meal time. Tappan
  thought this was singular. He could not remember when Jenet had been far from
  his camp at sunset. Somehow Tappan was glad.</p>

  <p>After he had his supper, he left his utensils and supplies as they
  happened to be, and strode away under the trees to the trysting-place where
  he was to meet Madge. To his surprise she came before dark, and, unused as he
  was to the complexity and emotional nature of a woman, he saw that she was
  strangely agitated. Her face was pale. Almost a fury burned in her black
  eyes. When she came up to Tappan, and embraced him, almost fiercely, he felt
  that he was about to learn more of the nature of womankind. She thrilled him
  to his depths.</p>

  <p>"Lead out the horses an' don't make any noise," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Tappan complied, and soon he was mounted, riding behind her on the trail.
  It surprised him that she headed down country, and traveled fast. Moreover,
  she kept to a trail that continually grew rougher. They came to a road, which
  she crossed, and kept on through darkness and brush so thick that Tappan
  could not see the least sign of a trail. And at length anyone could have seen
  that Madge had lost her bearings. She appeared to know the direction she
  wanted, but traveling upon it was impossible, owing to the increasingly
  cut-up and brushy ground. They had to turn back, and seemed to be hours
  finding the road. Once Tappan fancied he heard the thud of hoofs other than
  those made by their own horses. Here Madge acted strangely, and where she had
  been obsessed by desire to hurry she now seemed to have grown weary. She
  turned her horse south on the road. Tappan was thus enabled to ride beside
  her. But they talked very little. He was satisfied with the fact of being
  with her on the way out of the country. Some time in the night they reached
  an old log shack by the roadside. Here Tappan suggested they halt, and get
  some sleep before dawn. The morrow would mean a long hard day.</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-morrow will be hard," replied Madge, as she faced Tappan in the
  gloom. He could see her big dark eyes on him. Her tone was not one of a
  hopeful woman. Tappan pondered over this. But he could not understand,
  because he had no idea how a woman ought to act under such circumstances.
  Madge Beam was a creature of moods. Only the day before, on the ride down
  from the Rim, she had told him with a laugh that she was likely to love him
  madly one moment and scratch his eyes out the next. How could he know what to
  make of her? Still, an uneasy feeling began to stir in Tappan.</p>

  <p>They dismounted, and unsaddled the horses. Tappan took his pack and put it
  aside. Something frightened the horses. They bolted down the road.</p>

  <p>"Head them off," cried the woman, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Even on the instant her voice sounded strained to Tappan, as if she were
  choked. But, realizing the absolute necessity of catching the horses, he set
  off down the road on a run. And he soon succeeded in heading off the animal
  he had ridden. The other one, however, was contrary and cunning. When Tappan
  would endeavor to get ahead, it would trot briskly on. Yet it did not go so
  fast but what Tappan felt sure he would soon catch it. Thus walking and
  running, he put some distance between him and the cabin before he realized
  that he could not head off the wary beast. Much perturbed in mind, Tappan
  hurried back.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the cabin Tappan called to Madge. No answer! He could not
  see her in the gloom nor the horse he had driven back. Only silence brooded
  there. Tappan called again. Still no answer! Perhaps Madge had succumbed to
  weariness and was asleep. A search of the cabin and vicinity failed to yield
  any sign of her. But it disclosed the fact that Tappan's pack was gone.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he sat down, quite overcome. He had been duped. What a fierce
  pang tore his heart! But it was for loss of the woman&mdash;not the gold. He
  was stunned, and then sick with bitter misery. Only then did Tappan realize
  the meaning of love and what it had done to him. The night wore on, and he
  sat there in the dark and cold and stillness until the gray dawn told him of
  the coming of day.</p>

  <p>The light showed his saddle where he had left it. Near by lay one of
  Madge's gloves. Tappan's keen eye sighted a bit of paper sticking out of the
  glove. He picked it up. It was a leaf out of a little book he had seen her
  carry, and upon it was written in lead pencil:</p>

  <p>"I am Jake's wife, not his sister. I double-crossed him an' ran off with
  you an' would have gone to hell for you. But Jake an' his gang suspected me.
  They were close on our trail. I couldn't shake them. So here I chased off the
  horses an' sent you after them. It was the only way I could save your life."
  Tappan tracked the thieves to Globe. There he learned they had gone to
  Phoenix&mdash;three men and one woman.</p>

  <p>Tappan had money on his person. He bought horse and saddle, and, setting
  out for Phoenix, he let his passion to kill grow with the miles and hours. At
  Phoenix he learned Beam had cashed the gold&mdash;twelve thousand dollars. So
  much of a fortune! Tappan's fury grew. The gang separated here. Beam and his
  wife took stage for Tucson. Tappan had no trouble in trailing their
  movements.</p>

  <p>Gambling dives and inns and freighting posts and stage drivers told the
  story of the Beams and their ill-gotten gold. They went on to California,
  down into Tappan's country, to Yuma, and El Cajon, and San Diego. Here Tappan
  lost track of the woman. He could not find that she had left San Diego, nor
  any trace of her there. But Jake Beam had killed a Mexican in a brawl and had
  fled across the line.</p>

  <p>Tappan gave up for the time being the chase of Beam, and bent his efforts
  to find the woman. He had no resentment toward Madge. He only loved her. All
  that winter he searched San Diego. He made of himself a peddler as a ruse to
  visit houses. But he never found a trace of her. In the spring he wandered
  back to Yuma, raking over the old clues, and so on back to Tucson and
  Phoenix.</p>

  <p>This year of dream and love and passion and despair and hate made Tappan
  old. His great strength and endurance were not yet impaired, but something of
  his spirit had died out of him.</p>

  <p>One day he remembered Jenet. "My burro!" he soliloquized. "I had forgotten
  her...Jenet!"</p>

  <p>Then it seemed a thousand impulses merged in one drove him to face the
  long road toward the Rim Rock country. To remember Jenet was to grow
  doubtful. Of course she would be gone. Stolen or dead or wandered off! But
  then who could tell what Jenet might do? Tappan was both called and driven.
  He was a poor wanderer again. His outfit was a pack he carried on his
  shoulder. But while he could walk he would keep on until he found that last
  camp where he had deserted Jenet.</p>

  <p>October was coloring the canyon slopes when he reached the shadow of the
  great wall of yellow rock. The cabin where the Beams had lived&mdash;or had
  claimed they lived&mdash;was a fallen ruin, crushed by snow. Tappan saw other
  signs of a severe winter and heavy snowfall. No horse or cattle tracks showed
  in the trails.</p>

  <p>To his amaze his camp was much as he had left it. The stone fireplace, the
  iron pots, appeared to be in the same places. The boxes that had held his
  supplies were lying here and there. And his canvas tarpaulin, little the
  worse for wear of the elements, lay on the ground under the pine where he had
  slept. If any man had visited this camp in a year he had left no sign of
  it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Tappan espied a hoof track in the dust. A small
  track&mdash;almost oval in shape&mdash;fresh! Tappan thrilled through all his
  being.</p>

  <p>"Jenet's track, so help me God!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>He found more of them, made that morning. And, keen now as never before on
  her trail, he set out to find her. The tracks led up the canyon. Tappan came
  out into a little grassy clearing, and there stood Jenet, as he had seen her
  thousands of times. She had both long ears up high. She seemed to stare out
  of that meek, gray face. And then one of the long ears flopped over and
  drooped. Such perhaps was the expression of her recognition.</p>

  <p>Tappan strode up to her.</p>

  <p>"Jenet&mdash;old girl&mdash;you hung round camp&mdash;waitin' for me,
  didn't you?" he said, huskily, and his big hands fondled her long ears.</p>

  <p>Yes, she had waited. She, too, had grown old. She was gray. The winter of
  that year had been hard. What had she lived on when the snow lay so deep?
  There were lion scratches on her back, and scars on her legs. She had fought
  for her life.</p>

  <p>"Jenet, a man can never always tell about a burro," said Tappan. "I
  trained you to hang round camp an' wait till I came back...'Tappan's burro,'
  the desert rats used to say! An' they'd laugh when I bragged how you'd stick
  to me where most men would quit. But brag as I did, I never knew you, Jenet.
  An' I left you&mdash;an' forgot. Jenet, it takes a human bein'&mdash;a
  man&mdash;a woman&mdash;to be faithless. An' it takes a dog or a horse or a
  burro to be great...Beasts? I wonder now...Well, old pard, we're goin' down
  the trail together, an' from this day on Tappan begins to pay his debt."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Tappan never again had the old wanderlust for the stark and naked desert.
  Something had transformed him. The green and fragrant forests, and brown-
  aisled, pine-matted woodlands, the craggy promontories and the great colored
  canyons, the cold granite water springs of the Tonto seemed vastly preferable
  to the heat and dust and glare and the emptiness of the waste lands. But
  there was more. The ghost of his strange and only love kept pace with his
  wandering steps, a spirit that hovered with him as his shadow. Madge Beam,
  whatever she had been, had showed to him the power of love to refine and
  ennoble. Somehow he felt closer to her here in the cliff country where his
  passion had been born. Somehow she seemed nearer to him here than in all
  those places he had tracked her.</p>

  <p>So from a prospector searching for gold Tappan became a hunter, seeking
  only the means to keep soul and body together. And all he cared for was his
  faithful burro Jenet, and the loneliness and silence of the forest land.</p>

  <p>He was to learn that the Tonto was a hard country in many ways, and
  bitterly so in winter. Down in the brakes of the basin it was mild in winter,
  the snow did not lie long, and ice seldom formed. But up on the Rim, where
  Tappan always lingered as long as possible, the storm king of the north held
  full sway. Fifteen feet of snow and zero weather were the rule in dead of
  winter.</p>

  <p>An old native once warned Tappan: "See hyar, friend, I reckon you'd better
  not get caught up in the Rim Rock country in one of our big storms. Fer if
  you do you'll never get out."</p>

  <p>It was a way of Tappan's to follow his inclinations, regardless of advice.
  He had weathered the terrible midnight storm of hot wind in Death Valley.
  What were snow and cold to him? Late autumn on the Rim was the most perfect
  and beautiful of seasons. He had seen the forest land brown and darkly green
  one day, and the next burdened with white snow. What a transfiguration! Then
  when the sun loosened the white mantling on the pines, and they had shed
  their burdens in drifting dust of white, and rainbowed mists of melting snow,
  and avalanches sliding off the branches, there would be left only the
  wonderful white floor of the woodland. The great rugged brown tree trunks
  appeared mightier and statelier in the contrast; and the green of foliage,
  the russet of oak leaves, the gold of the aspens, turned the forest into a
  world enchanting to the desert-seared eyes of this wanderer.</p>

  <p>With Tappan the years sped by. His mind grew old faster than his body.
  Every season saw him lonelier. He had a feeling, a vague illusive
  foreshadowing that his bones, instead of bleaching on the desert sands, would
  mingle with the pine mats and the soft fragrant moss of the forest. The idea
  was pleasant to Tappan.</p>

  <p>One afternoon he was camped in Pine Canyon, a timber-sloped gorge far back
  from the Rim. November was well on. The fall had been singularly open and
  fair, with not a single storm. A few natives happening across Tappan had
  remarked casually that such autumns sometimes were not to be trusted.</p>

  <p>This late afternoon was one of Indian summer beauty and warmth. The blue
  haze in the canyon was not all the blue smoke from Tappan's campfire. In a
  narrow park of grass not far from camp Jenet grazed peacefully with elk and
  deer. Wild turkeys lingered there, loth to seek their winter quarters down in
  the basin. Gray squirrels and red squirrels barked and frisked, and dropped
  the pine and spruce cones, with thud and thump, on all the slopes.</p>

  <p>Before dark a stranger strode into Tappan's camp, a big man of middle age,
  whose magnificent physique impressed even Tappan. He was a rugged, bearded
  giant, wide-eyed and of pleasant face. He had no outfit, no horse, not even a
  gun.</p>

  <p>"Lucky for me I smelled your smoke," he said. "Two days for me without
  grub."</p>

  <p>"Howdy, stranger," was Tappan's greeting. "Are you lost?"</p>

  <p>"Yes an' no. I could find my way out down over the Rim, but it's not
  healthy down there for me. So I'm hittin' north."</p>

  <p>"Where's your horse an' pack?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon they're with the gang thet took more of a fancy to them than
  me."</p>

  <p>"Ahuh! You're welcome here, stranger," replied Tappan. "I'm Tappan."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Heard of you. I'm Jess Blade, of anywhere. An' I'll say, Tappan, I
  was an honest man till I hit the Tonto."</p>

  <p>His laugh was frank, for all its note of grimness. Tappan liked the man,
  and sensed one who would be a good friend and bad foe.</p>

  <p>"Come an' eat. My supplies are peterin' out, but there's plenty of
  meat."</p>

  <p>Blade ate, indeed, as a man starved, and did not seem to care if Tappan's
  supplies were low. He did not talk. After the meal he craved a pipe and
  tobacco. Then he smoked in silence, in a slow realizing content. The morrow
  had no fears for him. The flickering ruddy light from the camp fire shone on
  his strong face. Tappan saw in him the drifter, the drinker, the brawler, a
  man with good in him, but over whom evil passion or temper dominated.
  Presently he smoked the pipe out, and with reluctant hand knocked out the
  ashes and returned it to Tappan.</p>

  <p>"I reckon I've some news thet'd interest you," he said.</p>

  <p>"You have?" queried Tappan.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you're the Tappan who tried to run off with Jake Beam's
  wife."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm that Tappan. But I'd like to say I didn't know she was
  married."</p>

  <p>"Shore, I know thet. So does everybody in the Tonto. You were just meat
  for thet Beam gang. They had played the trick before. But accordin' to what I
  hear thet trick was the last fer Madge Beam. She never came back to this
  country. An' Jake Beam, when he was drunk, owned up thet she'd left him in
  California. Some hint at worse. Fer Jake Beam came back a harder man. Even
  his gang said thet."</p>

  <p>"Is he in the Tonto now?" queried Tappan, with a thrill of fire along his
  veins.</p>

  <p>"Yep, thar fer keeps," replied Blade, grimly. "Somebody shot him."</p>

  <p>"Ahuh!" exclaimed Tappan with a deep breath of relief. There came a sudden
  cooling of the heat of his blood.</p>

  <p>After that there was a long silence. Tappan dreamed of the woman who had
  loved him. Blade brooded over the camp fire. The wind moaned fitfully in the
  lofty pines on the slope. A wolf mourned as if in hunger. The stars appeared
  to obscure their radiance in haze.</p>

  <p>"Reckon thet wind sounds like storm," observed Blade, presently.</p>

  <p>"I've heard it for weeks now," replied Tappan.</p>

  <p>"Are you a woodsman?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm a desert man."</p>

  <p>"Wal, you take my hunch an' hit the trail fer low country."</p>

  <p>This was well meant, and probably sound advice, but it alienated Tappan.
  He had really liked this hearty-voiced stranger. Tappan thought moodily of
  his slowly ingrowing mind, of the narrowness of his soul. He was past
  interest in his fellow men. He lived with a dream. The only living creature
  he loved was a lop-eared, lazy burro, growing old in contentment.
  Nevertheless that night Tappan shared one of his two blankets.</p>

  <p>In the morning the gray dawn broke, and the sun rose without its
  brightness of gold. There was a haze over the blue sky. Thin, swift-moving
  clouds scudded up out of the southwest. The wind was chill, the forest shaggy
  and dark, the birds and squirrels were silent.</p>

  <p>"Wal, you'll break camp to-day," asserted Blade.</p>

  <p>"Nope. I'll stick it out yet a while," returned Tappan.</p>

  <p>"But, man, you might get snowed in, an' up hyar thet's serious."</p>

  <p>"Ahuh! Well, it won't bother me. An' there's nothin' holdin' you."</p>

  <p>"Tappan, it's four days' walk down out of this woods. If a big snow set
  in, how'd I make it?"</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better go out over the Rim," suggested Tappan.</p>

  <p>"No. I'll take my chance the other way. But are you meanin' you'd rather
  not have me with you? Fer you can't stay hyar."</p>

  <p>Tappan was in a quandary.</p>

  <p>Some instinct bade him tell the man to go. Not empty handed, but to go.
  But this was selfish, and entirely unlike Tappan as he remembered himself of
  old. Finally he spoke:</p>

  <p>"You're welcome to half my outfit&mdash;go or stay."</p>

  <p>"Thet's mighty square of you, Tappan," responded the other, feelingly.
  "Have you a burro you'll give me?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've only one."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Then I'll have to stick with you till you leave."</p>

  <p>No more was said. They had breakfast in a strange silence. The wind
  brooded its secret in the tree tops. Tappan's burro strolled into camp, and
  caught the stranger's eye.</p>

  <p>"Wal, thet's shore a fine burro," he observed. "Never saw the like."</p>

  <p>Tappan performed his camp tasks. And then there was nothing to do but sit
  around the fire. Blade evidently waited for the increasing menace of storm to
  rouse Tappan to decision. But the graying over of sky and the increase of
  wind did not affect Tappan. What did he wait for? The truth of his thoughts
  was that he did not like the way Jenet remained in camp. She was waiting to
  be packed. She knew they ought to go. Tappan yielded to a perverse devil of
  stubbornness. The wind brought a cold mist, then a flurry of wet snow. Tappan
  gathered firewood, a large quantity. Blade saw this and gave voice to earnest
  fears. But Tappan paid no heed. By nightfall sleet and snow began to fall
  steadily. The men fashioned a rude shack of spruce boughs, ate their supper,
  and went to bed early.</p>

  <p>It worried Tappan that Jenet stayed right in camp. He lay awake a long
  time. The wind rose, and moaned through the forest. The sleet failed, and a
  soft, steady downfall of snow gradually set in. Tappan fell asleep. When he
  awoke it was to see a forest of white. The trees were mantled with blankets
  of wet snow, the ground covered two feet on a level. But the clouds appeared
  to be gone, the sky was blue, the storm over. The sun came up warm and
  bright.</p>

  <p>"It'll all go in a day," said Tappan.</p>

  <p>"If this was early October I'd agree with you," replied Blade. "But it's
  only makin' fer another storm. Can't you hear thet wind?"</p>

  <p>Tappan only heard the whispers of his dreams. By now the snow was melting
  off the pines, and rainbows shone everywhere. Little patches of snow began to
  drop off the south branches of the pines and spruces, and then larger
  patches, until by mid-afternoon white streams and avalanches were falling
  everywhere. All of the snow, except in shaded places on the north sides of
  trees, went that day, and half of that on the ground. Next day it thinned out
  more, until Jenet was finding the grass and moss again. That afternoon the
  telltale thin clouds raced up out of the southwest and the wind moaned its
  menace.</p>

  <p>"Tappan, let's pack an' hit it out of hyar," appealed Blade, anxiously. "I
  know this country. Mebbe I'm wrong, of course, but it feels like storm.
  Winter's comin' shore."</p>

  <p>"Let her come," replied Tappan, imperturbably.</p>

  <p>"Say, do you want to get snowed in?" demanded Blade, out of patience.</p>

  <p>"I might like a little spell of it, seem' it'd be new to me," replied
  Tappan.</p>

  <p>"But man, if you ever get snowed in hyar you can't get out."</p>

  <p>"That burro of mine could get me out."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy. Thet burro couldn't go a hundred feet. What's more, you'd
  have to kill her an' eat her."</p>

  <p>Tappan bent a strange gaze upon his companion, but made no reply. Blade
  began to pace up and down the small bare patch of ground before the camp
  fire. Manifestly, he was in a serious predicament. That day he seemed subtly
  to change, as did Tappan. Both answered to their peculiar instincts, Blade to
  that of self-preservation, and Tappan, to something like indifference. Tappan
  held fate in defiance. What more could happen to him?</p>

  <p>Blade broke out again, in eloquent persuasion, giving proof of their
  peril, and from that he passed to amaze and then to strident anger. He cursed
  Tappan for a nature loving idiot.</p>

  <p>"An' I'll tell you what," he ended. "When mornin' comes I'll take some of
  your grub an' hit it out of hyar, storm or no storm."</p>

  <p>But long before dawn broke that resolution of Blade's had become
  impracticable. Both men were awakened by a roar of storm through the forest,
  no longer a moan, but a marching roar, with now a crash and then a shriek of
  gale! By the light of the smouldering camp fire Tappan saw a whirling pall of
  snow, great flakes as large as feathers. Morning disclosed the setting in of
  a fierce mountain storm, with two feet of snow already on the ground, and the
  forest lost in a blur of white.</p>

  <p>"I was wrong," called Tappan to his companion. "What's best to do
  now?"</p>

  <p>"You damned fool!" yelled Blade. "We've got to keep from freezin' an'
  starvin' till the storm ends an' a crust comes on the snow."</p>

  <p>For three days and three nights the blizzard continued, unabated in its
  fury. It took the men hours to keep a space cleared for their camp site,
  which Jenet shared with them. On the fourth day the storm ceased, the clouds
  broke away, the sun came out. And the temperature dropped to zero. Snow on
  the level just topped Tappan's lofty stature, and in drifts it was ten and
  fifteen feet deep. Winter had set in without compromise. The forest became a
  solemn, still, white world. But now Tappan had no time to dream. Dry firewood
  was hard to find under the snow. It was possible to cut down one of the dead
  trees on the slope, but impossible to pack sufficient wood to the camp. They
  had to burn green wood. Then the fashioning of snowshoes took much time.
  Tappan had no knowledge of such footgear. He could only help Blade. The men
  were encouraged by the piercing cold forming a crust on the snow. But just as
  they were about to pack and venture forth, the weather moderated, the crust
  refused to hold their weight, and another foot of snow fell.</p>

  <p>"Why in hell didn't you kill an elk?" demanded Blade, sullenly. He had
  become darkly sinister. He knew the peril and he loved life. "Now we'll have
  to kill an' eat your precious Jenet. An' mebbe she won't furnish meat enough
  to last till this snow weather stops an' a good freeze'll make travelin'
  possible."</p>

  <p>"Blade, you shut up about killin' an' eatin' my burro Jenet," returned
  Tappan, in a voice that silenced the other.</p>

  <p>Thus instinctively these men became enemies. Blade thought only of
  himself. Tappan had forced upon him a menace to the life of his burro. For
  himself Tappan had not one thought.</p>

  <p>Tappan's supplies ran low. All the bacon and coffee were gone. There was
  only a small haunch of venison, a bag of beans, a sack of flour, and a small
  quantity of salt loft.</p>

  <p>"If a crust freezes on the snow an' we can pack that flour, we'll get out
  alive," said Blade. "But we cant take the burro."</p>

  <p>Another day of bright sunshine softened the snow on the southern
  exposures, and a night of piercing cold froze a crust that would bear a quick
  step of man.</p>

  <p>"It's our only chance&mdash;an' damn slim at thet," declared Blade.</p>

  <p>Tappan allowed Blade to choose the time and method, and supplies for the
  start to get out of the forest. They cooked all the beans and divided them in
  two sacks. Then they baked about five pounds of biscuits for each of them.
  Blade showed his cunning when he chose the small bag of salt for himself and
  let Tappan take the tobacco. This quantity of food and a blanket for each
  Blade declared to be all they could pack. They argued over the guns, and in
  the end Blade compromised on the rifle, agreeing to let Tappan carry that on
  a possible chance of killing a deer or elk. When this matter had been
  decided, Blade significantly began putting on his rude snowshoes, that had
  been constructed from pieces of Tappan's boxes and straps and burlap
  sacks.</p>

  <p>"Reckon they won't last long," muttered Blade.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Tappan fed Jenet some biscuits and then began to strap a
  tarpaulin on her back.</p>

  <p>"What you doin'?" queried Blade, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Gettin' Jenet ready," replied Tappan.</p>

  <p>"Ready! For what?"</p>

  <p>"Why, to go with us."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" shouted Blade, and he threw up his hands in helpless rage.</p>

  <p>Tappan felt a depth stirred within him. He lost his late taciturnity and
  silent aloofness fell away from him. Blade seemed on the moment no longer an
  enemy. He loomed as an aid to the saving of Jenet. Tappan burst into
  speech.</p>

  <p>"I can't go without her. It'd never enter my head. Jenet's mother was a
  good faithful burro. I saw Jenet born way down there on the Rio Colorado. She
  wasn't strong. An' I had to wait for her to be able to walk. An' she grew up.
  Her mother died, an' Jenet an' me packed it alone. She wasn't no ordinary
  burro. She learned all I taught her. She was different. But I treated her
  same as any burro. An' she grew with the years. Desert men said there never
  was such a burro as Jenet. Called her Tappan's burro, an' tried to borrow an'
  buy an' steal her...How many times in ten years Jenet has done me a good turn
  I can't remember. But she saved my life. She dragged me out of Death
  Valley...An' then I forgot my debt. I ran off with a woman an' left Jenet to
  wait as she had been trained to wait...Well, I got back in time...An' now
  I'll not leave her here. It may be strange to you, Blade, me carin' this way.
  Jenet's only a burro. But I won't leave her."</p>

  <p>"Man, you talk like thet lazy lop-eared burro was a woman," declared
  Blade, in disgusted astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I don't know women, but I reckon Jenet's more faithful than most of
  them."</p>

  <p>"Wal, of all the stark, starin' fools I ever run into you're the
  worst."</p>

  <p>"Fool or not, I know what I'll do," retorted Tappan. The softer mood left
  him swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you sense enough to see thet we can't travel with your burro?"
  queried Blade, patiently controlling his temper. "She has little hoofs, sharp
  as knives. She'll cut through the crust. She'll break through in places. An'
  we'll have to stop to haul her out&mdash;mebbe break through ourselves. Thet
  would make us longer gettin' out."</p>

  <p>"Long or short we'll take her."</p>

  <p>Then Blade confronted Tappan as if suddenly unmasking his true meaning.
  His patient explanation meant nothing. Under no circumstances would he ever
  have consented to an attempt to take Jenet out of that snow-bound wilderness.
  His eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"We've a hard pull to get out alive. An' hard-workin' men in winter must
  have meat to eat."</p>

  <p>Tappan slowly straightened up to look at the speaker.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>For answer Blade jerked his hand backward and downward, and when it swung
  into sight again it held Tappan's worn and shining rifle. Then Blade, with
  deliberate force, that showed the nature of the man, worked the lever and
  threw a shell into the magazine. All the while his eyes were fastened on
  Tappan. His face seemed that of another man, evil, relentless, inevitable in
  his spirit to preserve his own life at any cost.</p>

  <p>"I mean to kill your burro," he said, in voice that suited his look and
  manner.</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Tappan, shocked into an instant of appeal.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am, an' I'll bet, by God, before we get out of hyar you'll be glad
  to eat some of her meat!"</p>

  <p>That roused the slow-gathering might of Tappan's wrath.</p>

  <p>"I'd starve to death before I'd&mdash;I'd kill that burro, let alone eat
  her."</p>

  <p>"Starve an' be damned!" shouted Blade, yielding to rage.</p>

  <p>Jenet stood right behind Tappan, in her posture of contented repose, with
  one long ear hanging down over her gray meek face.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to kill me first," answered Tappan, sharply.</p>

  <p>"I'm good fer anythin'&mdash;if you push me," returned Blade,
  stridently.</p>

  <p>As he stepped aside, evidently so he could have unobstructed aim at Jenet,
  Tappan leaped forward and knocked up the rifle as it was discharged. The
  bullet sped harmlessly over Jenet. Tappan heard it thud into a tree. Blade
  uttered a curse. And as he lowered the rifle in sudden deadly intent, Tappan
  grasped the barrel with his left hand. Then, clenching his right, he struck
  Blade a sodden blow in the face. Only Blade's hold on the rifle prevented him
  from falling. Blood streamed from his nose and mouth. He bellowed in hoarse
  fury,</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you&mdash;fer thet!"</p>

  <p>Tappan opened his clenched teeth: "No, Blade&mdash;you're not man
  enough."</p>

  <p>Then began a terrific struggle for possession of the rifle. Tappan beat at
  Blade's face with his sledge-hammer fist. But the strength of the other made
  it imperative that he use both hands to keep his hold on the rifle. Wrestling
  and pulling and jerking, the men tore round the snowy camp, scattering the
  camp fire, knocking down the brush shelter. Blade had surrendered to a wild
  frenzy. He hissed his maledictions. His was the brute lust to kill an enemy
  that thwarted him. But Tappan was grim and terrible in his restraint. His
  battle was to save Jenet. Nevertheless, there mounted in him the hot physical
  sensations of the savage. The contact of flesh, the smell and sight of
  Blade's blood, the violent action, the beastly mien of his foe changed the
  fight to one for its own sake. To conquer this foe, to rend him and beat him
  down, blow on blow!</p>

  <p>Tappan felt instinctively that he was the stronger. Suddenly he exerted
  all his muscular force into one tremendous wrench. The rifle broke, leaving
  the steel barrel in his hands, the wooden stock in Blade's. And it was the
  quicker- witted Blade who used his weapon first to advantage. One swift blow
  knocked Tappan down. As he was about to follow it up with another, Tappan
  kicked his opponent's feet from under him. Blade sprawled in the snow, but
  was up again as quickly as Tappan. They made at each other, Tappan waiting to
  strike, and Blade raining blows on Tappan. These were heavy blows aimed at
  his head, but which he contrived to receive on his arms and the rifle barrel
  he brandished. For a few moments Tappan stood up under a beating that would
  have felled a lesser man. His own blood blinded him. Then he swung his heavy
  weapon. The blow broke Blade's left arm. Like a wild beast, he screamed in
  pain; and then, without guard, rushed in, too furious for further caution.
  Tappan met the terrible onslaught as before, and watching his chance, again
  swung the rifle barrel. This time, so supreme was the force, it battered down
  Blade's arm and crushed his skull. He died on his feet&mdash;ghastly and
  horrible change!&mdash;and swaying backward, he fell into the upbanked wall
  of snow, and went out of sight, except for his boots, one of which still held
  the crude snowshoe.</p><a id="ill-01"

    <p class="caption">He fell into the upbanked wall of snow,<br>
    and went out of sight, except for his boots..."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Tappan stared, slowly realizing.</p>

  <p>"Ahuh, stranger Blade!" he ejaculated, gazing at the hole in the snow bank
  where his foe had disappeared. "You were goin' to&mdash;kill an'
  eat&mdash;Tappan's burro!"</p>

  <p>Then he sighted the bloody rifle barrel, and cast it from him. He became
  conscious of injuries which needed attention. But he could do little more
  than wash off the blood and bind up his head. Both arms and hands were badly
  bruised, and beginning to swell. But fortunately no bones had been
  broken.</p>

  <p>Tappan finished strapping the tarpaulin upon the burro; and, taking up
  both his and Blade's supply of food, he called out, "Come on, Jenet."</p>

  <p>Which way to go! Indeed, there was no more choice for him than there had
  been for Blade. Towards the Rim the snowdrift would be deeper and impassable.
  Tappan realized that the only possible chance for him was down hill. So he
  led Jenet out of camp without looking back once. What was it that had
  happened? He did not seem to be the same Tappan that had dreamily tramped
  into this woodland.</p>

  <p>A deep furrow in the snow had been made by the men packing firewood into
  camp. At the end of this furrow the wall of snow stood higher than Tappan's
  head. To get out on top without breaking the crust presented a problem. He
  lifted Jenet up, and was relieved to see that the snow held her. But he found
  a different task in his own case. Returning to camp, he gathered up several
  of the long branches of spruce that had been part of the shelter, and
  carrying them out he laid them against the slant of snow he had to surmount,
  and by their aid he got on top. The crust held him.</p>

  <p>Elated and with revived hope, he took up Jenet's halter and started off.
  Walking with his rude snowshoes was awkward. He had to go slowly, and slide
  them along the crust. But he progressed. Jenet's little steps kept her even
  with him. Now and then one of her sharp hoofs cut through, but not to hinder
  her particularly. Right at the start Tappan observed a singular something
  about Jenet. Never until now had she been dependent upon him. She knew it.
  Her intelligence apparently told her that if she got out of this snow-bound
  wilderness it would be owing to the strength and reason of her master.</p>

  <p>Tappan kept to the north side of the canyon, where the snow crust was
  strongest. What he must do was to work up to the top of the canyon slope, and
  then keeping to the ridge travel north along it, and so down out of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Travel was slow. He soon found lie had to pick his way. Jenet appeared to
  be absolutely unable to sense either danger or safety. Her experience had
  been of the rock confines and the drifting sands of the desert. She walked
  where Tappan led her. And it seemed to Tappan that her trust in him, her
  reliance upon him, were pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Well, old girl," said Tappan to her, "it's a horse of another color
  now&mdash;hey?"</p>

  <p>At length he came to a wide part of the canyon, where a bench of land led
  to a long gradual slope, thickly studded with small pines. This appeared to
  be fortunate, and turned out to be so, for when Jenet broke through the crust
  Tappan had trees and branches to hold to while he hauled her out. The labor
  of climbing that slope was such that Tappan began to appreciate Blade's
  absolute refusal to attempt getting Jenet out. Dusk was shadowing the white
  aisles of the forest when Tappan ascended to a level. He had not traveled far
  from camp, and the fact struck a chill upon his heart.</p>

  <p>To go on in the dark was foolhardy. So Tappan selected a thick spruce,
  under which there was a considerable depression in the snow, and here made
  preparation to spend the night. Unstrapping the tarpaulin, he spread it on
  the snow. All the lower branches of this giant of the forest were dead and
  dry. Tappan broke off many and soon had a fire. Jenet nibbled at the moss on
  the trunk of the spruce tree. Tappan's meal consisted of beans, biscuits, and
  a ball of snow, that he held over the fire to soften. He saw to it that Jenet
  fared as well as he. Night soon fell, strange and weirdly white in the
  forest, and piercingly cold. Tappan needed the fire. Gradually it melted the
  snow and made a hole, down to the ground. Tappan rolled up in the tarpaulin
  and soon fell asleep.</p>

  <p>In three days Tappan traveled about fifteen miles, gradually descending,
  until the snow crust began to fail to hold Jenet. Then whatever had been his
  difficulties before, they were now magnified a hundredfold. As soon as the
  sun was up, somewhat softening the snow, Jenet began to break through. And
  often when Tappan began hauling her out he broke through himself. This
  exertion was killing even to a man of Tappan's physical prowess. The
  endurance to resist heat and flying dust and dragging sand seemed another
  kind from that needed to toil on in this snow. The endless snow-bound forest
  began to be hideous to Tappan. Cold, lonely, dreary, white,
  mournful&mdash;the kind of ghastly and ghostly winter land that had been the
  terror of Tappan's boyish dreams! He loved the sun&mdash;the open. This
  forest had deceived him. It was a wall of ice. As he toiled on, the state of
  his mind gradually and subtly changed in all except the fixed and absolute
  will to save Jenet. In some places he carried her.</p>

  <p>The fourth night found him dangerously near the end of his stock of food.
  He had been generous with Jenet. But now, considering that he had to do more
  work than she, he diminished her share. On the fifth day Jenet broke through
  the snow crust so often that Tappan realized how utterly impossible it was
  for her to get out of the woods by her own efforts. Therefore Tappan hit upon
  the plan of making her lie on the tarpaulin, so that he could drag her. The
  tarpaulin doubled once did not make a bad sled. All the rest of that day
  Tappan hauled her. And so all the rest of the next day he toiled on, hands
  behind him, clutching the canvas, head and shoulders bent, plodding and
  methodical, like a man who could not be defeated. That night he was too weary
  to build a fire, and too worried to eat the last of his food.</p>

  <p>Next day Tappan was not unalive to the changing character of the forest.
  He had worked down out of the zone of the spruce trees; the pines had thinned
  out and decreased in size; oak trees began to show prominently. All these
  signs meant that he was getting down out of the mountain heights. But the
  fact, hopeful as it was, had drawbacks. The snow was still four feet deep on
  a level and the crust held Tappan only about half the time. Moreover, the lay
  of the land operated against. Tappan's progress. The long, slowly descending
  ridge had failed. There were no more canyons, but ravines and swales were
  numerous. Tappan dragged on, stern, indomitable, bent to his toil.</p>

  <p>When the crust let him down, he hung his snowshoes over Jenet's back, and
  wallowed through, making a lane for her to follow. Two days of such heart-
  breaking toil, without food or fire, broke Tappan's magnificent endurance.
  But not his spirit! He hauled Jenet over the snow, and through the snow, down
  the hills and up the slopes, through the thickets, knowing that over the next
  ridge, perhaps, was deliverance. Deer and elk tracks began to be numerous.
  Cedar and juniper trees now predominated. An occasional pine showed here and
  there. He was getting out of the forest land. Only such mighty and
  justifiable hope as that could have kept him on his feet.</p>

  <p>He fell often, and it grew harder to rise and go on. The hour came when
  the crust failed altogether to hold Tappan and he had to abandon hauling
  Jenet. It was necessary to make a road for her. How weary, cold, horrible,
  the white reaches! Yard by yard Tappan made his way. He no longer sweat. He
  had no feeling in his feet or legs. Hunger ceased to gnaw at his vitals. His
  thirst he quenched with snow&mdash;soft snow now, that did not have to be
  crunched like ice. The pangs in his breast were terrible&mdash;cramps,
  constrictions, the piercing pains in his lungs, the dull ache of his
  overtaxed heart.</p>

  <p>Tappan came to an opening in the cedar forest from which he could see
  afar. A long slope fronted him. It led down and down to open country. His
  desert eyes, keen as those of an eagle, made out flat country, sparsely
  covered with snow, and black dots that were cattle. The last slope! The last
  pull! Three feet of snow, except in drifts; down and down he plunged, making
  way for Jenet! All that day he toiled and fell and rolled down this
  league-long slope, wearing towards sunset to the end of his task, and
  likewise to the end of his will.</p>

  <p>Now he seemed up and now down. There was no sense of cold or weariness.
  Only direction! Tappan still saw! The last of his horror at the monotony of
  white faded from his mind. Jenet was there, beginning to be able to travel
  for herself. The solemn close of endless day found Tappan arriving at the
  edge of the timbered country, where wind-bared patches of ground showed long,
  bleached grass. Jenet took to grazing.</p>

  <p>As for Tappan, he fell with the tarpaulin, under a thick cedar, and with
  strengthless hands plucked and plucked at the canvas to spread it, so that he
  could cover himself. He looked again for Jenet. She was there, somehow a
  fading image, strangely blurred. But she was grazing. Tappan lay down, and
  stretched out, and slowly drew the tarpaulin over him.</p>

  <p>A piercing cold night wind swept down from the snowy heights. It wailed in
  the edge of the cedars and moaned out towards the open country. Yet the night
  seemed silent. The stars shone white in a deep blue sky&mdash;passionless,
  cold, watchful eyes, looking down without pity or hope or censure. They were
  the eyes of Nature. Winter had locked the heights in its snowy grip. All
  night that winter wind blew down, colder and colder. Then dawn broke, steely,
  gray, with a flare in the east.</p>

  <p>Jenet came back where she had left her master. Camp! As she had returned
  thousands of dawns in the long years of her service. She had grazed all
  night. Her sides that had been flat were now full. Jenet had weathered
  another vicissitude of her life. She stood for a while, in a doze, with one
  long ear down over her meek face. Jenet was waiting for Tappan.</p>

  <p>But he did not stir from under the long roll of canvas. Jenet waited. The
  winter sun rose, in cold yellow flare. The snow glistened as with a crusting
  of diamonds. Somewhere in the distance sounded a long-drawn, discordant bray.
  Jenet's ears shot up. She listened. She recognized the call of one of her
  kind. Instinct always prompted Jenet. Sometimes she did bray. Lifting her
  gray head she sent forth a clarion: "Hee-haw hee-haw-haw&mdash;hee-haw
  how-e-e-e!" That stentorian call started the echoes. They pealed down the
  slope and rolled out over the open country, clear as a bugle blast, yet
  hideous in their discordance. But this morning Tappan did not awaken.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">II.&mdash;THE GREAT SLAVE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Ladies' Home Journal</i>, December 1920</h3>

  <p class="first">A VOICE on the wind whispered to Siena the prophecy of his
  birth. "A chief is born to save the vanishing tribe of Crows! A hunter to his
  starving people!" While he listened, at his feet swept swift waters, the
  rushing, green-white, thundering Athabasca, spirit-forsaken river; and it
  rumbled his name and murmured his fate. "Siena! Siena! His bride will rise
  from a wind kiss on the flowers in the moonlight! A new land calls to the
  last of the Crows! Northward where the wild goose ends its flight Siena will
  father a great people!"</p>

  <p>So Siena, a hunter of the leafy trails, dreamed his dreams; and at sixteen
  he was the hope of the remnant of a once powerful tribe, a stripling chief,
  beautiful as a bronzed autumn god, silent, proud, forever listening to voices
  on the wind.</p>

  <p>To Siena the lore of the woodland came as flight comes to the
  strong-winged wild fowl. The secrets of the forests were his, and of the
  rocks and rivers.</p>

  <p>He knew how to find the nests of the plover, to call the loon, to net the
  heron, and spear the fish. He understood the language of the whispering
  pines. Where the deer came down to drink and the caribou browsed on moss and
  the white rabbit nibbled in the grass and the bear dug in the logs for
  grubs&mdash;all these he learned; and also when the black flies drove the
  moose into the water and when the honk of the geese meant the approach of the
  north wind.</p>

  <p>He lived in the woods, with his bow, his net, and his spear. The trees
  were his brothers. The loon laughed for his happiness, the wolf mourned for
  his sadness. The bold crag above the river, Old Stoneface, heard his step
  when he climbed there in the twilight. He communed with the stern god of his
  ancestors and watched the flashing Northern Lights and listened.</p>

  <p>From all four corners came his spirit guides with steps of destiny on his
  trail. On all the four winds breathed voices whispering of his future;
  loudest of all called the Athabasca, god-forsaken river, murmuring of the
  bride born of a wind kiss on the flowers in the moonlight.</p><a id="ill-03"

  </div><br>

  <p>On all the four winds breathed voices whispering of his future.</p>

  <p>It was autumn, with the flame of leaf fading, the haze rolling out of the
  hollows, the lull yielding to moan of coming wind. All the signs of a severe
  winter were in the hulls of the nuts, in the fur of the foxes, in the flight
  of waterfowl. Siena was spearing fish for winter store. None so keen of sight
  as Siena, so swift of arm; and as he was the hope, so he alone was the
  provider for the starving tribe. Siena stood to his knees in a brook where it
  flowed over its gravelly bed into the Athabasca. Poised high was his wooden
  spear. It glinted downward swift as a shaft of sunlight through the leaves.
  Then Siena lifted a quivering whitefish and tossed it upon the bank where his
  mother Ema, with other women of the tribe, sun-dried the fish upon a
  rock.</p>

  <p>Again and again, many times, flashed the spear. The young chief seldom
  missed his aim. Early frosts on the uplands had driven the fish down to
  deeper water, and as they came darting over the bright pebbles Siena called
  them by name.</p>

  <p>The oldest squaw could not remember such a run of fish. Ema sang the
  praises of her son; the other women ceased the hunger chant of the tribe.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a hoarse shout pealed out over the waters.</p>

  <p>Ema fell in a fright; her companions ran away; Siena leaped upon the bank,
  clutching his spear. A boat in which were men with white faces drifted down
  toward him.</p>

  <p>"Hal-loa!" again sounded the hoarse cry.</p>

  <p>Ema cowered in the grass. Siena saw a waving of white hands; his knees
  knocked together and he felt himself about to flee. But Siena of the Crows,
  the savior of a vanishing tribe, must not fly from visible foes.</p>

  <p>"Palefaces," he whispered, trembling, yet stood his ground ready to fight
  for his mother. He remembered stories of an old Indian who had journeyed far
  to the south and had crossed the trails of the dreaded white men. There
  stirred in him vague memories of strange Indian runners telling camp-fire
  tales of white hunters with weapons of lightning and thunder.</p>

  <p>"Naza! Naza!" Siena cast one fleeting glance to the north and a prayer to
  his god of gods. He believed his spirit would soon be wandering in the shades
  of the other Indian world.</p>

  <p>As the boat beached on the sand Siena saw men lying with pale faces upward
  to the sky, and voices in an unknown tongue greeted him. The tone was
  friendly, and he lowered his threatening spear. Then a man came up the bank,
  his hungry eyes on the pile of fish, and he began to speak haltingly in
  mingled Cree and Chippewayan language:</p>

  <p>"Boy&mdash;we're white friends&mdash;starving&mdash;let us buy
  fish&mdash;trade for fish&mdash;we're starving and we have many moons to
  travel."</p>

  <p>"Siena's tribe is poor," replied the lad; "sometimes they starve too. But
  Siena will divide his fish and wants no trade."</p>

  <p>His mother, seeing the white men intended no evil, came out of her fright
  and complained bitterly to Siena of his liberality. She spoke of the menacing
  winter, of the frozen streams, the snow-bound forest, the long night of
  hunger. Siena silenced her and waved the frightened braves and squaws back to
  their wigwams.</p>

  <p>"Siena is young," he said simply; "but he is chief here. If we
  starve&mdash;we starve."</p>

  <p>Whereupon he portioned out a half of the fish. The white men built a fire
  and sat around it feasting like famished wolves around a fallen stag. When
  they had appeased their hunger they packed the remaining fish in the boat,
  whistling and singing the while. Then the leader made offer to pay, which
  Siena refused, though the covetous light in his mother's eyes hurt him
  sorely.</p>

  <p>"Chief," said the leader, "the white man understands; now he offers
  presents as one chief to another."</p>

  <p>Thereupon he proffered bright beads and tinseled trinkets, yards of calico
  and strips of cloth. Siena accepted with a dignity in marked contrast to the
  way in which the greedy Ema pounced upon the glittering heap. Next the
  paleface presented a knife which, drawn from its scabbard, showed a blade
  that mirrored its brightness in Siena's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Chief, your woman complains of a starving tribe," went on the white man.
  "Are there not many moose and reindeer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But seldom can Siena creep within range of his arrow."</p>

  <p>"A-ha! Siena will starve no more," replied the man, and from the boat he
  took a long iron tube with a wooden stock.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked Siena.</p>

  <p>"The wonderful shooting stick. Here, boy, watch! See the bark on the camp
  fire. Watch!"</p>

  <p>He raised the stick to his shoulder. Then followed a streak of flame, a
  puff of smoke, a booming report; and the bark of the camp fire flew into
  bits.</p>

  <p>The children dodged into the wigwams with loud cries, the women ran
  screaming, Ema dropped in the grass wailing that the end of the world had
  come, while Siena, unable to move hand or foot, breathed another prayer to
  Naza of the northland.</p>

  <p>The white man laughed and, patting Siena's arm, he said: "No fear." Then
  he drew Siena away from the bank, and began to explain the meaning and use of
  the wonderful shooting stick. He reloaded it and fired again and yet again,
  until Siena understood and was all aflame at the possibilities of such a
  weapon.</p>

  <p>Patiently the white man taught the Indian how to load it, sight, and
  shoot, and how to clean it with ramrod and buckskin. Next he placed at
  Siena's feet a keg of powder, a bag of lead bullets, and boxes full of caps.
  Then he bade Siena farewell, entered the boat with his men and drifted round
  a bend of the swift Athabasca.</p>

  <p>Siena stood alone upon the bank, the wonderful shooting stick in his
  hands, and the wail of his frightened mother in his ears. He comforted her,
  telling her the white men were gone, that he was safe, and that the prophecy
  of his birth had at last begun its fulfillment. He carried the precious
  ammunition to a safe hiding place in a hollow log near his wigwam and then he
  plunged into the forest.</p>

  <p>Siena bent his course toward the runways of the moose. He walked in a kind
  of dream, for he both feared and believed. Soon the glimmer of water,
  splashes and widening ripples, caused him to crawl stealthily through the
  ferns and grasses to the border of a pond. The familiar hum of flies told him
  of the location of his quarry. The moose had taken to the water, driven by
  the swarms of black flies, and were standing neck deep, lifting their muzzles
  to feed on the drooping poplar branches. Their wide-spreading antlers, tipped
  back into the water, made the ripples.</p>

  <p>Trembling as never before, Siena sank behind a log. He was within fifty
  paces of the moose. How often in that very spot had he strung a feathered
  arrow and shot it vainly! But now he had the white man's weapon, charged with
  lightning and thunder. Just then the poplars parted above the shore,
  disclosing a bull in the act of stepping down. He tossed his antlered head at
  the cloud of humming flies, then stopped, lifting his nose to scent the
  wind.</p>

  <p>"Naza!" whispered Siena in his swelling throat.</p>

  <p>He rested the shooting stick on the log and tried to see over the brown
  barrel. But his eyes were dim. Again he whispered a prayer to Naza. His sight
  cleared, his shaking arms stilled, and with his soul waiting, hoping,
  doubting, he aimed and pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>High the moose flung his ponderous head, to crash down upon his knees, to
  roll in the water and churn a bloody foam, and then lie still.</p>

  <p>"Siena! Siena!"</p>

  <p>Shrill the young chief's exultant yell pealed over the listening waters,
  piercing the still forest, to ring back in echo from Old Stoneface. It was
  Siena's triumphant call to his forefathers, watching him from the
  silence.</p>

  <p>The herd of moose plowed out of the pond and crashed into the woods,
  where, long after they had disappeared, their antlers could be heard cracking
  the saplings.</p>

  <p>When Siena stood over the dead moose his doubts fled; he was indeed god
  chosen. No longer chief of a starving tribe! Reverently and with immutable
  promise he raised the shooting stick to the north, toward Naza who had
  remembered him; and on the south, where dwelt the enemies of his tribe, his
  dark glance brooded wild and proud and savage.</p>

  <p>Eight times the shooting stick boomed out in the stillness and eight moose
  lay dead in the wet grasses. In the twilight Siena wended his way home and
  placed eight moose tongues before the whimpering squaws.</p>

  <p>"Siena is no longer a boy," he said. "Siena is a hunter. Let his women go
  bring in the meat."</p>

  <p>Then to the rejoicing and feasting and dancing of his tribe he turned a
  deaf ear, and in the night passed alone under the shadow of Old Stoneface,
  where he walked with the spirits of his ancestors and believed the voices on
  the wind.</p>

  <p>Before the ice locked the ponds Siena killed a hundred moose and reindeer.
  Meat and fat and oil and robes changed the world for the Crow tribe.</p>

  <p>Fires burned brightly all the long winter; the braves awoke from their
  stupor and chanted no more; the women sang of the Siena who had come, and
  prayed for summer wind and moonlight to bring his bride.</p>

  <p>Spring went by, summer grew into blazing autumn, and Siena's fame and the
  wonder of the shooting stick spread through the length and breadth of the
  land.</p>

  <p>Another year passed, then another, and Siena was the great chief of the
  rejuvenated Crows. He had grown into a warrior's stature, his face had the
  beauty of the god chosen, his eye the falcon flash of the Sienas of old. Long
  communion in the shadow of Old Stoneface had added wisdom to his other gifts;
  and now to his worshiping tribe all that was needed to complete the prophecy
  of his birth was the coming of the alien bride.</p>

  <p>It was another autumn, with the wind whipping the tamaracks and moaning in
  the pines, and Siena stole along a brown, fern-lined trail. The dry smell of
  fallen leaves filled his nostrils; he tasted snow in the keen breezes. The
  flowers were dead, and still no dark-eyed bride sat in his wigwam. Siena
  sorrowed and strengthened his heart to wait. He saw her flitting in the
  shadows around him, a wraith with dusky eyes veiled by dusky wind-blown hair,
  and ever she hovered near him, whispering from every dark pine, from every
  waving tuft of grass.</p>

  <p>To her whispers he replied: "Siena waits."</p>

  <p>He wondered of what alien tribe she would come. He hoped not of the
  unfriendly Chippewayans or the far-distant Blackfeet; surely not of the
  hostile Crees, life enemies of his tribe, destroyers of its once puissant
  strength, jealous now of its resurging power.</p>

  <p>Other shadows flitted through the forest, spirits that rose silently from
  the graves over which he trod, and warned him of double steps on his trail,
  of unseen foes watching him from the dark coverts. His braves had repeated
  gossip, filterings from stray Indian wanderers, hinting of plots against the
  risen Siena. To all these he gave no heed, for was not he Siena, god-chosen,
  and had he not the wonderful shooting stick?</p>

  <p>It was the season that he loved, when dim forest and hazy fernland spoke
  most impellingly. The tamaracks talked to him, the poplars bowed as he
  passed, and the pines sang for him alone. The dying vines twined about his
  feet and clung to him, and the brown ferns, curling sadly, waved him a
  welcome that was a farewell. A bird twittered a plaintive note and a loon
  whistled a lonely call. Across the wide gray hollows and meadows of white
  moss moaned the north wind, bending all before it, blowing full into Siena's
  face with its bitter promise. The lichen-covered rocks and the rugged-barked
  trees and the creatures that moved among them&mdash;the whole world of earth
  and air heard Siena's step on the rustling leaves and a thousand voices
  hummed in the autumn stillness.</p>

  <p>So he passed through the shadowy forest and over the gray muskeg flats to
  his hunting place. With his birchbark horn he blew the call of the moose. He
  alone of hunting Indians had the perfect moose call. There, hidden within a
  thicket, he waited, calling and listening till an angry reply bellowed from
  the depths of a hollow, and a bull moose, snorting fight, came cracking the
  saplings in his rush. When he sprang fierce and bristling into the glade,
  Siena killed him. Then, laying his shooting stick over a log, he drew his
  knife and approached the beast.</p>

  <p>A snapping of twigs alarmed Siena and he whirled upon the defensive, but
  too late to save himself. A band of Indians pounced upon him and bore him to
  the ground. One wrestling heave Siena made, then he was overpowered and
  bound. Looking upward, he knew his captors, though he had never seen them
  before; they were the lifelong foes of his people, the fighting Crees.</p>

  <p>A sturdy chief, bronze of face and sinister of eye, looked grimly down
  upon his captive. "Baroma makes Siena a slave."</p>

  <p>Siena and his tribe were dragged far southward to the land of the Crees.
  The young chief was bound upon a block in the center of the village where
  hundreds of Crees spat upon him, beat him, and outraged him in every way
  their cunning could devise. Siena's gaze was on the north and his face showed
  no sign that he felt the torments.</p>

  <p>At last Baroma's old advisers stopped the spectacle, saying: "This is a
  man!"</p>

  <p>Siena and his people became slaves of the Crees. In Baroma's lodge, hung
  upon caribou antlers, was the wonderful shooting stick with Siena's powder
  horn and bullet pouch, objects of intense curiosity and fear.</p>

  <p>None knew the mystery of this lightning-flashing, thunder-dealing thing;
  none dared touch it.</p>

  <p>The heart of Siena was broken; not for his shattered dreams or the end of
  his freedom, but for his people. His fame had been their undoing. Slaves to
  the murderers of his forefathers! His spirit darkened, his soul sickened; no
  more did sweet voices sing to him on the wind, and his mind dwelt apart from
  his body among shadows and dim shapes.</p>

  <p>Because of his strength he was worked like a dog at hauling packs and
  carrying wood; because of his fame he was set to cleaning fish and washing
  vessels with the squaws. Seldom did he get to speak a word to his mother or
  any of his people. Always he was driven.</p>

  <p>One day, when he lagged almost fainting, a maiden brought him water to
  drink. Siena looked up, and all about him suddenly brightened, as when
  sunlight bursts from cloud.</p>

  <p>"Who is kind to Siena?" he asked, drinking.</p>

  <p>"Baroma's daughter," replied the maiden.</p>

  <p>"What is her name?"</p>

  <p>Quickly the maiden bent her head, veiling dusky eyes with dusky hair.
  "Emihiyah."</p>

  <p>"Siena has wandered on lonely trails and listened to voices not meant for
  other ears. He has heard the music of Emihiyah on the winds. Let the daughter
  of Siena's great foe not fear to tell of her name."</p>

  <p>"Emihiyah means a wind kiss on the flowers in the moonlight," she
  whispered shyly and fled.</p>

  <p>Love came to the last of the Sienas and it was like a glory. Death
  shuddered no more in Siena's soul. He saw into the future, and out of his
  gloom he rose again, god chosen in his own sight, with such added beauty to
  his stern face and power to his piercing eye and strength to his lofty frame
  that the Crees quailed before him and marveled. Once more sweet voices came
  to him, and ever on the soft winds were songs of the dewy moorlands to the
  northward, songs of the pines and the laugh of the loon and of the rushing,
  green-white, thundering Athabasca, godforsaken river.</p>

  <p>Siena's people saw him strong and patient, and they toiled on, unbroken,
  faithful. While he lived, the pride of Baroma was vaunting. "Siena waits"
  were the simple words he said to his mother, and she repeated them as wisdom.
  But the flame of his eye was like the leaping Northern Lights, and it kept
  alive the fire deep down in their breasts.</p>

  <p>In the winter when the Crees lolled in their wigwams, when less labor fell
  to Siena, he set traps in the snow trails for silver fox and marten. No Cree
  had ever been such a trapper as Siena. In the long months he captured many
  furs, with which he wrought a robe the like of which had not before been the
  delight of a maiden's eye. He kept it by him for seven nights, and always
  during this time his ear was turned to the wind. The seventh night was the
  night of the midwinter feast, and when the torches burned bright in front of
  Baroma's lodge Siena took the robe and, passing slowly and stately till he
  stood before Emihiyah, he laid it at her feet.</p>

  <p>Emihiyah's dusky face paled, her eyes that shone like stars drooped behind
  her flying hair, and all her slender body trembled.</p>

  <p>"Slave!" cried Baroma, leaping erect. "Come closer that Baroma may see
  what kind of a dog approaches Emihiyah."</p>

  <p>Siena met Baroma's gaze, but spoke no word. His gift spoke for him. The
  hated slave had dared to ask in marriage the hand of the proud Baroma's
  daughter. Siena towered in the firelight with something in his presence that
  for a moment awed beholders. Then the passionate and untried braves broke the
  silence with a clamor of the wolf pack.</p>

  <p>Tillimanqua, wild son of Baroma, strung an arrow to his bow and shot it
  into Siena's hip, where it stuck, with feathered shaft quivering.</p>

  <p>The spring of the panther was not swifter than Siena; he tossed
  Tillimanqua into the air and, flinging him down, trod on his neck and
  wrenched the bow away. Siena pealed out the long-drawn war whoop of his tribe
  that had not been heard for a hundred years, and the terrible cry stiffened
  the Crees in their tracks.</p>

  <p>Then he plucked the arrow from his hip and, fitting it to the string,
  pointed the gory flint head at Tillimanqua's eyes and began to bend the bow.
  He bent the tough wood till the ends almost met, a feat of exceeding great
  strength, and thus he stood with brawny arms knotted and stretched.</p>

  <p>A scream rent the suspense. Emihiyah fell upon her knees. "Spare
  Emihiyah's brother!"</p>

  <p>Siena cast one glance at the kneeling maiden, then, twanging the bow
  string, he shot the arrow toward the sky.</p>

  <p>"Baroma's slave is Siena," he said, with scorn like the lash of a whip.
  "Let the Cree learn wisdom."</p>

  <p>Then Siena strode away, with a stream of dark blood down his thigh, and
  went to his brush tepee, where he closed his wound.</p>

  <p>In the still watches of the night, when the stars blinked through the
  leaves and the dew fell, when Siena burned and throbbed in pain, a shadow
  passed between his weary eyes and the pale light. And a voice that was not
  one of the spirit voices on the wind called softly over him, "Siena! Emihiyah
  comes."</p>

  <p>The maiden bound the hot thigh with a soothing balm and bathed his fevered
  brow.</p>

  <p>Then her hands found his in tender touch, her dark face bent low to his,
  her hair lay upon his cheek. "Emihiyah keeps the robe," she said.</p>

  <p>"Siena loves Emihiyah," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Emihiyah loves Siena," she whispered.</p>

  <p>She kissed him and stole away.</p>

  <p>On the morrow Siena's wound was as if it had never been; no eye saw his
  pain. Siena returned to his work and his trapping. The winter melted into
  spring, spring flowered into summer, summer withered into autumn.</p>

  <p>Once in the melancholy days Siena visited Baroma in his wigwam. "Baroma's
  hunters are slow. Siena sees a famine in the land."</p>

  <p>"Let Baroma's slave keep his place among the squaws," was the reply.</p>

  <p>That autumn the north wind came a moon before the Crees expected it; the
  reindeer took their annual march farther south; the moose herded warily in
  open groves; the whitefish did not run, and the seven-year pest depleted the
  rabbits.</p>

  <p>When the first snow fell Baroma called a council and then sent his hunting
  braves far and wide.</p>

  <p>One by one they straggled back to camp, footsore and hungry, and each with
  the same story. It was too late.</p>

  <p>A few moose were in the forest, but they were wild and kept far out of
  range of the hunter's arrows, and there was no other game.</p>

  <p>A blizzard clapped down upon the camp, and sleet and snow whitened the
  forest and filled the trails. Then winter froze everything in icy clutch. The
  old year drew to a close.</p>

  <p>The Crees were on the brink of famine. All day and all night they kept up
  their chanting and incantations and beating of tom-toms to conjure the return
  of the reindeer. But no reindeer appeared.</p>

  <p>It was then that the stubborn Baroma yielded to his advisers and consented
  to let Siena save them from starvation by means of his wonderful shooting
  stick. Accordingly Baroma sent word to Siena to appear at his wigwam.</p>

  <p>Siena did not go, and said to the medicine men: "Tell Baroma soon it will
  be for Siena to demand."</p>

  <p>Then the Cree chieftain stormed and stamped in his wigwam and swore away
  the life of his slave. Yet again the wise medicine men prevailed. Siena and
  the wonderful shooting stick would be the salvation of the Crees. Baroma,
  muttering deep in his throat like distant thunder, gave sentence to starve
  Siena until he volunteered to go forth to hunt, or let him be the first to
  die.</p>

  <p>The last scraps of meat, except a little hoarded in Baroma's lodge, were
  devoured, and then began the boiling of bones and skins to make a soup to
  sustain life. The cold days passed and a silent gloom pervaded the camp.
  Sometimes a cry of a bereaved mother, mourning for a starved child, wailed
  through the darkness. Siena's people, long used to starvation, did not suffer
  or grow weak so soon as the Crees. They were of hardier frame, and they were
  upheld by faith in their chief. When he would sicken it would be time for
  them to despair. But Siena walked erect as in the days of his freedom, nor
  did he stagger under the loads of firewood, and there was a light on his
  face. The Crees, knowing of Baroma's order that Siena should be the first to
  perish of starvation, gazed at the slave first in awe, then in fear. The last
  of the Sienas was succored by the spirits.</p>

  <p>But god-chosen though Siena deemed himself, he knew it was not by the
  spirits that he was fed in this time of famine. At night in the dead
  stillness, when even no mourning of wolf came over the frozen wilderness,
  Siena lay in his brush tepee close and warm under his blanket. The wind was
  faint and low, yet still it brought the old familiar voices. And it bore
  another sound&mdash;the soft fall of a moccasin on the snow. A shadow passed
  between Siena's eyes and the pale light.</p>

  <p>"Emihiyah comes," whispered the shadow and knelt over him.</p><a id=
  "ill-04"
        name="ill-04"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1201831h-images/Tappan4.jpg"
         title="Illustration 4">

    <p class="caption">"Emihiyah comes," whispered the shadow and knelt over
    him.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She tendered a slice of meat which she had stolen from Barorna's scant
  hoard as he muttered and growled in uneasy slumber. Every night since her
  father's order to starve Siena, Emihiyah had made this perilous errand.</p>

  <p>And now her hand sought his and her dusky hair swept his brow. "Emihiyah
  is faithful," she breathed low.</p>

  <p>"Siena only waits," he replied.</p>

  <p>She kissed him and stole away.</p>

  <p>Cruel days fell upon the Crees before Barorna's pride was broken. Many
  children died and some of the mothers were beyond help. Siena's people kept
  their strength, and he himself showed no effect of hunger. Long ago the Cree
  women had deemed him superhuman, that the Great Spirit fed him from the happy
  hunting grounds.</p>

  <p>At last Baroma went to Siena. "Siena may save his people and the
  Crees."</p>

  <p>Siena regarded him long, then replied: "Siena waits."</p>

  <p>"Let Baroma know. What does Siena wait for? While he waits we die."</p>

  <p>Siena smiled his slow, inscrutable smile and turned away.</p>

  <p>Baroma sent for his daughter and ordered her to plead for her life.</p>

  <p>Emihiyah came, fragile as a swaying reed, more beautiful than a rose
  choked in a tangled thicket, and she stood before Siena with doe eyes veiled.
  "Emihiyah begs Siena to save her and the tribe of Crees."</p>

  <p>"Siena waits," replied the slave.</p>

  <p>Baroma roared in his fury and bade his braves lash the slave. But the
  blows fell from feeble arms and Siena laughed at his captors.</p>

  <p>Then, like a wild lion unleashed from long thrall, he turned upon them:
  "Starve! Cree dogs! Starve! When the Crees all fall like leaves in autumn,
  then Siena and his people will go back to the north."</p>

  <p>Baroma's arrogance left him then, and on another day, when Emihiyah lay
  weak and pallid in his wigwam and the pangs of hunger gnawed at his own
  vitals, he again sought Siena. "Let Siena tell for what he waits."</p>

  <p>Siena rose to his lofty height and the leaping flame of the Northern Light
  gathered in his eyes. "Freedom!" One word he spoke and it rolled away on the
  wind.</p>

  <p>"Baroma yields," replied the Cree, and hung his head.</p>

  <p>"Send the squaws who can walk and the braves who can crawl out upon
  Siena's trail."</p>

  <p>Then Siena went to Baroma's lodge and took up the wonderful shooting stick
  and, loading it, he set out upon snowshoes into the white forest. He knew
  where to find the moose yards in the sheltered corners. He heard the bulls
  pounding the hard-packed snow and cracking their antlers on the trees. The
  wary beasts would not have allowed him to steal close, as a warrior armed
  with a bow must have done, but Siena fired into the herd at long range. And
  when they dashed off, sending the snow up like a spray, a huge black bull lay
  dead. Siena followed them as they floundered through the drifts, and whenever
  he came within range he shot again. When five moose were killed he turned
  upon his trail to find almost the whole Cree tribe had followed him and were
  tearing the meat and crying out in a kind of crazy joy. That night the fires
  burned before the wigwams, the earthen pots steamed, and there was great
  rejoicing. Siena hunted the next day, and the next, and for ten days he went
  into the white forest with his wonderful shooting stick, and eighty moose
  fell to his unerring aim.</p>

  <p>The famine was broken and the Crees were saved.</p>

  <p>When the mad dances ended and the feasts were over, Siena appeared before
  Baroma's lodge. "Siena will lead his people northward."</p>

  <p>Baroma, starving, was a different chief from Baroma well fed and in no
  pain. All his cunning had returned. "Siena goes free. Baroma gave his word.
  But Siena's people remain slaves."</p>

  <p>"Siena demanded freedom for himself and people," said the younger
  chief.</p>

  <p>"Baroma heard no word of Siena's tribe. He would not have granted freedom
  for them. Siena's freedom was enough."</p>

  <p>"The Cree twists the truth. He knows Siena would not go without his
  people. Siena might have remembered Baroma's cunning. The Crees were ever
  liars."</p>

  <p>Baroma stalked before his fire with haughty presence. About him in the
  circle of light sat his medicine men, his braves and squaws. "The Cree is
  kind. He gave his word. Siena is free. Let him take his wonderful shooting
  stick and go back to the north."</p>

  <p>Siena laid the shooting stick at Baroma's feet and likewise the powder
  horn and bullet pouch. Then he folded his arms, and his falcon eyes looked
  far beyond Baroma to the land of the changing lights and the old home on the
  green- white, rushing Athabasca, god-forsaken river. "Siena stays."</p>

  <p>Baroma started in amaze and anger. "Siena makes Baroma's word idle.
  Begone!"</p>

  <p>"Siena stays!"</p>

  <p>The look of Siena, the pealing reply, for a moment held the chief mute.
  Slowly Baroma stretched wide his arms and lifted them, while from his face
  flashed a sullen wonder. "Great Slave!" he thundered.</p>

  <p>So was respect forced from the soul of the Cree, and the name thus wrung
  from his jealous heart was one to live forever in the lives and legends of
  Siena's people.</p>

  <p>Baroma sought the silence of his lodge, and his medicine men and braves
  dispersed, leaving Siena standing in the circle, a magnificent statue facing
  the steely north.</p>

  <p>From that day insult was never offered to Siena, nor word spoken to him by
  the Crees, nor work given. He was free to come and go where he willed, and he
  spent his time in lessening the tasks of his people.</p>

  <p>The trails of the forest were always open to him, as were the streets of
  the Cree village. If a brave met him, it was to step aside; if a squaw met
  him, it was to bow her head; if a chief met him, it was to face him as
  warriors faced warriors.</p>

  <p>One twilight Emihiyah crossed his path, and suddenly she stood as once
  before, like a frail reed about to break in the wind. But Siena passed on.
  The days went by and each one brought less labor to Siena's people, until
  that one came wherein there was no task save what they set themselves.
  Siena's tribe were slaves, yet not slaves.</p>

  <p>The winter wore by and the spring and the autumn, and again Siena's fame
  went abroad on the four winds. The Chippewayans journeyed from afar to see
  the Great Slave, and likewise the Blackfeet and the Yellow Knives. Honor
  would have been added to fame; councils called; overtures made to the somber
  Baroma on behalf of the Great Slave, but Siena passed to and fro among his
  people, silent and cold to all others, true to the place which his great foe
  had given him. Captive to a lesser chief, they said; the Great Slave who
  would yet free his tribe and gather to him a new and powerful nation.</p>

  <p>Once in the late autumn Siena sat brooding in the twilight by Ema's tepee.
  That night all who came near him were silent. Again Siena was listening to
  voices on the wind, voices that had been still for long, which he had tried
  to forget. It was the north wind, and it whipped the spruces and moaned
  through the pines. In its cold breath it bore a message to Siena, a hint of
  coming winter and a call from Naza, far north of the green-white, thundering
  Athabasca, river without a spirit.</p>

  <p>In the darkness when the camp slumbered Siena faced the steely north. As
  he looked a golden shaft, arrow-shaped and arrow-swift, shot to the
  zenith.</p>

  <p>"Naza!" he whispered to the wind. "Siena watches."</p>

  <p>Then the gleaming, changing Northern Lights painted a picture of gold and
  silver bars, of flushes pink as shell, of opal fire and sunset red; and it
  was a picture of Siena's life from the moment the rushing Athabasca rumbled
  his name, to the far distant time when he would say farewell to his great
  nation and pass forever to the retreat of the winds. God chosen he was, and
  had power to read the story in the sky.</p>

  <p>Seven nights Siena watched in the darkness; and on the seventh night, when
  the golden flare and silver shafts faded in the north, he passed from tepee
  to tepee, awakening his people. "When Siena's people hear the sound of the
  shooting stick let them cry greatly: Siena kills Baroma! Siena kills
  Baroma!"</p>

  <p>With noiseless stride Siena went among the wigwams and along the lanes
  until he reached Baroma's lodge. Entering in the dark he groped with his
  hands upward to a moose's antlers and found the shooting stick. Outside he
  fired it into the air.</p>

  <p>Like a lightning bolt the report ripped asunder the silence, and the
  echoes clapped and reclapped from the cliffs. Sharp on the dying echoes Siena
  bellowed his war whoop, and it was the second time in a hundred years for
  foes to hear that terrible, long-drawn cry.</p>

  <p>Then followed the shrill yells of Siena's people: "Siena kills
  Baroma...Siena kills Baroma...Siena kills Baroma!"</p>

  <p>The slumber of the Crees awoke to a babel of many voices; it rose hoarsely
  on the night air, swelled hideously into a deafening roar that shook the
  earth.</p>

  <p>In this din of confusion and terror when the Crees were lamenting the
  supposed death of Baroma and screaming in each other's ears, "The Great Slave
  takes his freedom!" Siena ran to his people and, pointing to the north, drove
  them before him.</p>

  <p>Single file, like a long line of flitting specters, they passed out of the
  fields into the forest. Siena kept close on their trail, ever looking
  backward, and ready with the shooting stick.</p>

  <p>The roar of the stricken Crees softened in his ears and at last died
  away.</p>

  <p>Under the black canopy of whispering leaves, over the gray, mist-shrouded
  muskeg flats, around the glimmering reed-bordered ponds, Siena drove his
  people.</p>

  <p>All night Siena hurried them northward and with every stride his heart
  beat higher. Only he was troubled by a sound like the voice that came to him
  on the wind.</p>

  <p>But the wind was now blowing in his face, and the sound appeared to be at
  his back. It followed on his trail as had the step of destiny. When he
  strained his ears he could not hear it, yet when he had gone on swiftly,
  persuaded it was only fancy, then the voice that was not a voice came
  haunting him.</p>

  <p>In the gray dawn Siena halted on the far side of a gray flat and peered
  through the mists on his back trail. Something moved out among the shadows, a
  gray shape that crept slowly, uttering a mournful cry.</p>

  <p>"Siena is trailed by a wolf," muttered the chief.</p>

  <p>Yet he waited, and saw that the wolf was an Indian. He raised the fatal
  shooting stick.</p>

  <p>As the Indian staggered forward, Siena recognized the robe of silver fox
  and marten, his gift to Emihiyah. He laughed in mockery. It was a Cree trick.
  Tillimanqua had led the pursuit disguised in his sister's robe. Baroma would
  find his son dead on the Great Slave's trail.</p>

  <p>"Siena!" came the strange, low cry.</p>

  <p>It was the cry that had haunted him like the voice on the wind. He leaped
  as a bounding deer.</p>

  <p>Out of the gray fog burned dusky eyes half-veiled by dusky hair, and
  little hands that he knew wavered as fluttering leaves. "Emihiyah comes," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Siena waits," he replied.</p>

  <p>Out of the gray fog burned dusky eyes half veiled by dusky
  hair&mdash;"Emihiyah comes," she said. "Siena waits," he replied.</p>

  <p>Far to the northward he led his bride and his people, far beyond the old
  home on the green-white, thundering Athabasca, god-forsaken river; and there,
  on the lonely shores of an inland sea, he fathered the Great Slave Tribe.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">SUNSET&mdash;it was the hour of Yaqui's watch. Chief of a
  driven remnant of the once mighty tribe, he trusted no sentinel so well as
  himself at the end of the day's march. While his braves unpacked the tired
  horses, and his women prepared the evening meal, and his bronze-skinned
  children played in the sand, Yaqui watched the bold desert horizon.</p>

  <p>Long years of hatred had existed between the Yaquis of upland Sonora and
  the Mexicans from the east. Like eagles, the Indian tribe had lived for
  centuries in the mountain fastnesses of the Sierra Madre, free, happy,
  self-sufficient. But wandering prospectors had found gold in their country
  and that had been the end of their peace. At first the Yaquis, wanting only
  the wildness and loneliness of their homes, moved farther and farther back
  from the ever encroaching advance of the gold diggers. At last, driven from
  the mountains into the desert, they realized that gold was the doom of their
  tribe and they began to fight for their land. Bitter and bloody were the
  battles; and from father to son this wild, free, proud race bequeathed a
  terrible hatred.</p>

  <p>Yaqui was one of the last great chiefs of his once great tribe. All his
  life he remembered the words of his father and his grandfather&mdash;that the
  Yaquis must find an unknown and impenetrable hiding place or perish from the
  earth. When Mexican soldiers at the decree of their government made war upon
  this tribe, killing those who resisted and making slaves of the captured,
  Yaqui with his family and followers set out upon a last journey across the
  Sonoran wilderness. Hateful and fearful of the east, whence this blight of
  gold diggers and land robbers appeared to come, he had fled toward the
  setting sun into a waste of desert land unknown to his people&mdash;a desert
  of scorching heat and burning sand and tearing cactus and treacherous lava,
  where water and wood and grass seemed days apart. Some of the youngest
  children had died on the way and all except the strong braves were wearing
  out.</p>

  <p>Alone, on a ridge of rising ground, Yaqui faced the back trail and watched
  with falcon eyes. Miles distant though that horizon was, those desert eyes
  could have made out horses against the clear sky. He did not gaze steadily,
  for the Indian method was to flash a look across the spaces, from near to
  far, and to fix the eye momentarily, to strain the vision and magnify all
  objects, then to avert the gaze from that direction and presently flash it
  back again.</p><a id="ill-05"

  </div><br>

  <p>Alone on a ridge of rising ground Yaqui faced the back trail and watched
  with falcon eyes.</p>

  <p>Lonely, wild, and grand, the scene seemed one of lifelessness. Only the
  sun lived, still hot, as it burned red-gold far away on the rugged rim of
  this desert world. Nothing breathed in that vastness. To Yaqui's ear the
  silence was music. The red sun slipped down and the desert changed. The
  golden floor of sand and rock shaded cold to the horizon and above that the
  sky lost its rose, turning to intense luminous blue. In the far distance the
  peaks dimmed and vanished in purple. The fire of the western heavens paled
  and died, and over all the rock-ribbed, sand-encumbered plateau stole a
  wondrous gray shade. Yaqui watched until that gray changed to black and the
  horizon line was lost in night. Safe now from pursuers were he and his people
  until the dawn.</p>

  <p>Then, guided by a speck of camp-fire light, he returned to his silent men
  and moaning women and a scant meal that he divided. Hunger was naught to
  Yaqui, nor thirst. Four days could he travel the desert without drink, an
  endurance most of his hardy tribe were trained to. And as for toil, the
  strength of his giant frame had never reached its limit. But strong chief
  that he was, when he listened to the moaning women and gazed at the silent,
  set faces of the children under the starlight he sagged to the sands and,
  bowing his head, prayed to his gods. He prayed for little&mdash;only life,
  freedom, loneliness, a hidden niche where his people would hear no steps and
  fear no specters on their trail. Then with unquenchable faith he stretched
  his great length on the sands; and the night was as a moment.</p>

  <p>In the gray of a dawn cold, pure, and silent, with the radiant morning
  star shining like a silver moon, the long file of Yaquis rode and tramped
  westward, on down the rugged bare slopes of this unknown desert.</p>

  <p>And out of the relentless east, land of enemies, rose the glaring sun.
  Like magic the frost melted off the rocks and the cool freshness of morning
  changed to a fiery breath. The sun climbed, and the leagues were as long as
  the hours. Down into a broad region of lava toiled the fugitives. Travel over
  the jagged crusts and through the poison-spiked cholla lamed the horses and
  made walking imperative. Yaqui drove his people before him, and some of the
  weakest fell by the way.</p>

  <p>Out of the hot lava and stinging cactus the Indians toiled and entered a
  region of bare stone, cut by wind and water into labyrinthine passages where,
  even if they had left tracks on the hard rocks, few pursuers could have
  followed them. Yaqui told this to his people, told them he saw sheep on the
  peaks above and smelled water, and thus urged them on and on league after
  league toward distant purple heights. Vast and hard as had been the desert
  behind them, this strange upflung desert before them seemed vaster and
  grimmer. The trackless way led ever upward by winding passages and
  gorges&mdash;a gloomy and weird region of colored stone. And over all reigned
  the terrible merciless sun.</p>

  <p>Yaqui sacrificed horses to the thirst and hunger of his people and
  abandoned the horror of toil under the sun to a slower progress by night.
  Blanched and magnified under the great stars, the iron-bound desert of riven
  rock, so unreal and weird, brought forth a chant from the lips of Yaqui's
  women. His braves, stoic like himself, endured and plodded on, lightening
  burdens of the weaker and eventually carrying the children. That night passed
  and a day of stupor in the shade of sun-heated rock; another night led the
  fugitives onward and upward through a maze of shattered cliffs, black and
  wild. Day dawned once more, showing Yaqui by the pitiless light that only his
  men could endure much more of this dragging on.</p>

  <p>He made camp there and encouraged his people by a faith that had come to
  him during the night&mdash;a whisper from the spirit of his
  forefathers&mdash;to endure, to live, to go to a beautiful end his vision
  could not see. Then Yaqui stalked alone off into the fastnesses of the rocks
  and prayed to his gods for guidance. All about him were silence, desolation,
  a gray barren world of rock, a black barren world of lava. Far as his falcon
  eye could see to the north and east and south stretched the illimitable
  glaring desert, rough, peaked, spiked, riven, ghastly with yellow slopes,
  bleak with its bare belts, terrible with its fluted and upflung plateaus,
  stone faced by endless ramparts and fast bound to the fading distance. From
  the west, up over the dark and forlorn heights, Yaqui heard the whispers of
  his dead forefathers.</p>

  <p>Another dawn found Yaqui on the great heights with the sunrise at his back
  and with another and more promising world at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Land of our forefathers!" he cried out sonorously to his people, gazing
  mutely down into the promised land. A vast gray-green valley yawned at their
  feet. Leagues of grassy, rock-ribbed, and tree-dotted slopes led down to a
  gleaming white stream, winding like a silver ribbon down the valley, to lose
  itself far in the lower country, where the colored desert merged into an
  immense and boundless void of hazy blue&mdash;the sea.</p>

  <p>"Great Water, where the sun sleeps," said Yaqui with long arm
  outstretched. "Yaqui's father's father saw it."</p>

  <p>Yaqui carried the boy and led the way down from the heights. Mountain
  sheep and wild horses and deer and quail that had never before seen man
  showed no fear of this invasion of their wild home. And Yaqui's people,
  footsore and starved, gazed round them and, in the seeming safety of this
  desert-locked valley with its grass and water and wood and abundant game,
  they took hope again and saw their prayers answered and happiness once more
  possible. New life flushed their veins. The long slopes, ever greener as they
  descended, were welcome to aching eyes so tired of the glaring expanses of
  the desert.</p>

  <p>For an encampment Yaqui chose the head of the valley. Wide and gently
  sloping, with a rock-walled spring that was the source of the stream, and
  large iron wood trees and pines and paloverdes, this lonely hidden spot
  satisfied the longing in Yaqui's heart. Almost his joy was complete. But
  never could he feel wholly secure again, even had he wings of an eagle. For
  Yaqui's keen eyes had seen gold in the sands of the stream; and gold spelled
  the doom of the Indian. Still Yaqui was grateful and content. Not soon indeed
  would his people be tracked to this fastness, and perhaps never. He cautioned
  his braves to save their scant gun ammunition, sending them out with bows and
  arrows to kill the tame deer and antelope. The weary squaws no longer chanted
  the melancholy songs of their woe. The long travel had ended. They unpacked
  their stores under the wide-spreading pines, made fires to roast the meat
  that would soon be brought, and attended to the ailments of the few children
  left to them. Soon the naked little ones, starved and cut and worn as they
  were, took to the clear cool water like goslings learning to swim.</p>

  <p>Yaqui, carrying his rifle, stalked abroad to learn more of this wonderful
  valley. Stretching at length along the stream, he drank deeply, as an Indian
  who loved mountain water. The glint of gold in the wet sand did not please
  him as had the sweetness of the cold water. Grasping up a handful of sand and
  pebbles, he rubbed and washed it in his palm. Tiny grains of gold and little
  nuggets of gold! Somewhere up at the head of this valley lay the mother lode
  from which the gold had washed down.</p>

  <p>Yaqui knew that here was treasure for which the white men would spill
  blood and sell their souls. But to the Indians&mdash;the Papagos, the Yumas,
  the man- eating Seris, and especially to the Yaquis&mdash;gold was no more
  than rock or sand, except that they hated it for the curse of white hunters
  it lured to the desert. Yaqui had found many a rich vein and ledge and placer
  of gold. He had hated them, and now more than any other he hated this new
  discovery. It would be a constant peril to his people. In times of flood this
  mountain stream would carry grains of gold as far as it flowed down on the
  desert. Yaqui saw in it a menace. But there was hope in the fact that many
  treasures of the desert heights would never be seen by white men. His father
  had told him that. This gray valley was high, cradled in the rocky uplands,
  and it might be inaccessible from below.</p>

  <p>Yaqui set out to see. His stride was that of the strongest and tallest of
  his tribe, and distance meant little to him. Hunger gnawed at his vitals, but
  the long march across the wastes and heights had not tired him. Yaqui had
  never known exhaustion. Before the sun stood straight overhead he had
  ascertained that this valley of promise was shut off from the west and that
  the stream failed in impassable desert. From north and east he had traveled,
  and therefore felt a grim security. But to the south he turned apprehensive
  eyes. Long he tramped and high he climbed, at last to see that the valley,
  this land of his forefathers, could be gained from the south. Range and ridge
  sloped gradually to a barren desolate land of sun and cacti, far as his
  desert eyes could see. That must be the land of the Seris, the man-eaters.
  But it was a waterless hell in summer. No fear from the south till the winter
  rains fell! Yaqui returned to his camp, reaching there at sunset. There was
  joy in the dusky welcoming eyes of his young wife as she placed fresh meat
  before him.</p>

  <p>"Yaqui's only son will live," she said, and pointed to the frail boy as he
  slept. The chief gazed somberly at the little brown face of his son, the last
  of his race.</p>

  <p>Days passed. With rest and food and water the gloomy spirit of the Yaquis
  underwent a gradual change. The wild valley was an Indian's happy hunting
  ground, encompassed by lofty heights known only to sheep and eagles. Like
  wild animals, all savages, in the peace and loneliness of a secluded region,
  soon forgot past trials and fears. Still, the chief Yaqui did not forget, but
  as time passed and nothing disturbed the serenity of this hiding place his
  vigilance slowly relaxed. The wind and the sun and the solitude and the
  presence of antelope and wild horses always within sight of camp&mdash;these
  factors of primitive nature had a healing effect upon his sore heart. In the
  canyons he found graves and bones of his progenitors.</p>

  <p>Days passed into weeks. The scarlet blossoms flamed at the long ends of
  the ocatilla; one morning the pale vordes, which had been bare and shiny
  green, appeared to have burst into full bloom, a yellow flowering that
  absorbed the sunlight; cacti opened great buds of magenta; from the canyon
  walls, on inaccessible ledges, hung the exquisite and rare desert flowers,
  lluvia d'oro, shower of gold; and many beautiful flowers lifted their faces
  out of the tall grasses. This magic of spring did not last long. The flowers
  faded, died, and blew away on the dry wind; the tall grasses slowly yellowed
  and bleached. Summer came. The glaring sun blazed over the eastern ramparts,
  burned white down over the still solemn valley, and sank like a huge ball of
  fire into the distant hazy sea. With the torrid heat of desert Sonora came a
  sense of absolute security to the chief Yaqui. His new home was locked in the
  furnace of the sun-blasted waste land. The clear spring of mountain water
  sank lower and lower, yet it did not fail. The birds and beasts that visited
  the valley attested to the nature of the surrounding country. So the time
  came when Yaqui forgot the strange feeling of distant steps upon his
  trail.</p>

  <p>When autumn came all the valley was dry and gray and withered, except the
  green line along the stream and the perennial freshness of the cactus plants
  and the everlasting green of the paloverdes. With the winter season came the
  rains, and a wave of ever-brightening green flushed the vast valley from its
  eastern height of slope to the far distant mouth, where it opened into the
  barren breaks of the desert.</p>

  <p>Manifestly the god of the Yaquis had not forgotten them. As the months
  passed child after child was born to the women of the tribe. Yaqui's
  dusky-eyed wife bore him a healthy girl baby. As the chief balanced the tiny
  brown form in his great hand he remembered speech of his own father's: "Son,
  let the Yaquis go back to the mountains of the setting sun&mdash;to a land
  free from white men and gold and fire water, to the desert valley where deer
  graze with horses. There let the Yaquis multiply into a great people or
  perish from the earth."</p>

  <p>Yaqui watched his girl baby with a gleam of troubled hope lighting in his
  face. His father had spoken prophecy. There waved the green grass of the
  broad valley, dotted with wild horses, antelope, and deer grazing among his
  stock. Here in his hand lay another child&mdash;a woman child&mdash;and he
  had believed his son to be the last of his race. It was not too late. The god
  of the Indian was good. His branch of the Yaquis would mother and father a
  great people. But even as he fondled his babe the toe of his moccasin stirred
  grains of gold in the sand.</p>

  <p>Love of life lulled Yaqui back into his dreams. To live, to have his
  people round him, to see his dusky-eyed wife at her work, to watch the little
  naked children playing in the grass, to look out over that rolling, endless
  green valley, so wild, so lonely, so fertile&mdash;such a proof of god in the
  desert&mdash;to feel the hot sun and the sweet wind and the cool night, to
  linger on the heights watching, listening, feeling, to stalk the keen-eyed
  mountain sheep, to eat fresh meat and drink pure water, to rest through the
  solemn still noons and sleep away the silent melancholy nights, to enjoy the
  games of his forefathers&mdash;wild games of riding and running&mdash;to
  steal off alone into the desert and endure heat, thirst, cold, dust,
  starvation while he sought the Indian gods hidden in the rocks, to be free of
  the white man whom he recognized as a superior and a baser being&mdash;to
  live like the eagles&mdash;to live&mdash;Yaqui asked no more.</p>

  <p>Yaqui laid the baby back in the cradle of its mother's breast and stalked
  out as a chief to inspire his people.</p>

  <p>In that high altitude the morning air was cold, exhilarating, sweet to
  breathe and wonderful to send the blood racing. Some winter mornings there
  was just a touch of frost on the leaves. The sunshine was welcome, the day
  was short, the night was long. Yaqui's people reverted to their old order of
  happy primitive life before the white man had come with greed for gold and
  lust to kill.</p>

  <p>The day dawned in which Yaqui took his son out and put him upon a horse.
  As horsemen the Yaquis excelled all other Indian tribes of the Southwest.
  Boys were given lessons at an early age and taught to ride bareback. Thus as
  youths they developed exceeding skill and strength.</p>

  <p>Some of the braves had rounded up a band of wild horses and had driven
  them into a rough rock-walled triangle, a natural trap, the opening of which
  they had closed with a rude fence. On this morning the Yaquis all assembled
  to see the wild horses broken. Yaqui, as an inspiration to his little son and
  to the other boys of the tribe, chose the vicious leader of the band as the
  horse he would first ride and break. High on the rocky wall perched the
  black-eyed boys, eager and restless, excited and wondering, some of them
  naked and all of them stretching out tousled black heads with shining ragged
  hair flying in the wind. The women and girls of the tribe occupied another
  position along the outcropping of gray wall, their colorful garments lending
  contrast to the scene.</p>

  <p>The inclosure was wide and long, containing both level and uneven ground,
  some of which was grass and some sand and rock. A few ironwood trees and one
  huge paloverde, under which Indians were lolling, afforded shade. At the edge
  of the highest slope began a line of pine trees that reached up to the bare
  gray heights.</p>

  <p>Yaqui had his braves drive the vicious leader of the wild horses out into
  the open. It was a stallion, of ungainly shape and rusty color, no longer
  young. With ugly head high, nostrils distended, mouth open and ears up,
  showing the white of vicious, fiery eyes, it pranced in the middle of the
  circle drawn by its captors.</p>

  <p>Yaqui advanced with his long leather riata, and, once clear of the ring of
  horsemen inclosing the stallion, he waved them back. Then as the wild steed
  plunged to and fro, seeking for an opening in that circle, Yaqui swung the
  long noose. He missed twice. The third cast caught its mark, the snarling
  nose of this savage horse. Yaqui hauled the lasso taut. Then with snort of
  fright the stallion lunged and reared, pawing the air. Yaqui, hauling hand
  over hand, pulled him down and approached him at the same time. Shuddering
  all over, breathing with hard snorts, the stallion faced his captor one
  moment, as if ready to fight. But fear predominated. He leaped away. At the
  end of that leap, so powerful was the strain on him, he went down in the
  sand. Up he sprang, wilder than ever, and dashed forward, dragging the
  Indian, gaining yards of the lasso. But the mounted Yaquis blocked his
  passage; he had to swerve; and as he ran desperately in a circle once more
  the giant chief hauled hand over hand on the rope. Suddenly Yaqui bounded in
  and with a tremendous leap, like the leap of a huge panther, he gained the
  back of the stallion and seemed to become fixed there. He dropped the lasso,
  and with the first startled jump of the stallion the noose loosened and
  slipped off. Except for Yaqui's great, long brown legs, with their strung
  bands of muscle set like steel, the stallion was free.</p>

  <p>The stallion bolted for the open. Only the rock wall checked his headlong
  flight. Then he wheeled and ran along the wall, bounding over rocks and
  ditches, stretching out until, with magnificent stride, he was running at his
  topmost speed. Along one wall and then the other he dashed, round and round
  and across, until the moment came when panic succeeded to fury, and then his
  tremendous energies were directed to the displacement of his rider. Wildly he
  pitched. With head down, legs stiff, feet together, he plunged over the sand,
  plowing up the dust, and bounding straight up. But he could not unseat his
  inexorable rider. Yaqui's legs banded his belly and were as steel. Then the
  stallion, now lashed into white lather of sweat and froth, lunged high to paw
  the air and scream and plunge down to pitch again. His motions soon lost
  their energy, though not their fury. Then he reached back with eyes of fire
  and open mouth to bite. Yaqui's huge fist met him, first on the right, then,
  as he turned, on the left. Last he plunged to his knees and with rumbling
  heave of anger he fell on his side, meaning to roll over his rider. But the
  Yaqui's leg on that side flashed high while his hands twisted hard in the
  long mane. When the foiled horse rose again Yaqui rose with him, again fixed
  tight on his back. Another dash and burst of running, wild and blind this
  time and plainly losing speed, showed the weakening of the stallion. And the
  time arrived when, spent and beaten, he fell in the sand.</p>

  <p>"Let Yaqui's son learn to ride like his father," said the chief to his
  gleeful, worshiping son.</p>

  <p>Then the chief again stalked forth, drawn irresistibly by something in the
  hour.</p>

  <p>"Let Yaqui's son watch and remember to tell his son's son," he said.</p>

  <p>He scattered his riders to block the few passages out of the valley and he
  ordered his son and all the women of the tribe and their children again to
  climb high on the rocks, there to watch. The Indian gods said this day marked
  the rejuvenation of their tribe. Let his son, who would be chief some day,
  and his people, see the great runner of the Yaquis.</p>

  <p>Naked except for his moccasins, the giant chief broke into a slow trot
  that was habitual with him when alone on a trail; and he crossed the stream
  and the plots of sand, and headed out into the grassy valley where deer
  grazed with the horses. Yaqui selected the one that appeared largest and
  strongest of the herd and to it he called in a loud voice, meant as well for
  the spirit of his forefathers and for his gods, watching and listening from
  the heights: "Yaqui runs to kill!"</p>

  <p>The sleek gray deer left off their grazing and stood at gaze, with long
  ears erect. Then they bounded off. Yaqui broke from his trot into a long,
  swinging lope and the length of his stride was such that he seemed to fly
  over the ground. Up the valley the deer scattered and Yaqui ran in the trail
  of the one to which he had called. Half a mile off it halted to look back.
  Then it grazed a little, but soon lifted its head to look again. Yaqui ran on
  at the same easy, distance-devouring stride. Presently the deer dashed away
  and kept on until it was a mere speck in Yaqui's eyes. It climbed a deer
  trail that led over the heights, to be turned back there by one of Yaqui's
  braves. Then it crossed the wide valley to be turned back by insurmountable
  cliffs. Yaqui kept it in sight and watched it trot and stop, run and walk and
  stop again, all the way up the long grassy slope toward the head of the
  valley.</p>

  <p>Here among rocks and trees Yaqui lost sight of his quarry, but he trailed
  it with scarcely a slackening of his pace. At length, coming out upon a level
  open bench, he saw the deer he had chosen to run to death. It was looking
  back.</p>

  <p>Down the grassy middle of the vast valley, clear to the mouth where the
  stream tumbled off into space, across the wide level from slope to slope,
  back under the beetling heights, Yaqui pursued the doomed deer.</p>

  <p>Leagues and leagues of fleet running had availed the deer nothing. It
  could not shake off the man. More and more the distance between them
  lessened. Terror now added to the gradual exhaustion of the four-footed
  creature, designed by Nature to escape its foes. Yaqui, perfect in all the
  primal attributes of man, was its superior. The race was not to the swift but
  to the enduring.</p>

  <p>Within sight of his people and his little son Yaqui overtook the
  staggering deer and broke its neck with his naked hands. Then for an instant
  he stood erect over his fallen quarry, a tall and gaunt giant, bathed in the
  weird afterglow of sunset; and he lifted a long arm to the heights, as if
  calling upon his spirits there to gaze down upon the victory of the red
  man.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>It was toward evening of another day, all the hours of which had haunted
  Yaqui with a nameless oppression. Like a deer that scented a faint strange
  taint on the pure air Yaqui pointed his sensitive nose toward the east,
  whence came the soft wind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his strong vision quivered to the movement of distant objects on
  the southern slope. Halting, he fixed his gaze. Long line of moving dots!
  Neither deer nor sheep nor antelope traveled in that formation. The objects
  were men. Yaqui's magnified sight caught the glint of sunset red on shining
  guns. Mexican soldiers! That nameless haunting fear of the south, long
  lulled, now had its fulfillment.</p>

  <p>Yaqui leaped with gigantic bounds down the slope. Like an antelope he
  sprang over rocks and dips, and once on the grassy downs he ran the swiftest
  race of his life. His piercing yells warned his people in time to save them
  from being surprised by the soldiers. The first shots of combat were fired as
  he hurdled the several courses of the stream. Yaqui saw the running and
  crawling forms of men in dusty blue&mdash;saw them aim short
  carbines&mdash;saw spurts of flame and puffs of smoke.</p>

  <p>Yaqui's last few bounds carried him into the stonewalled encampment, and
  the whistling bullets that missed him told how the line of soldiers was
  spreading to surround the place. Yaqui flung himself behind the wall and
  crawled to where his braves knelt with guns and bows ready. Some of them were
  shooting. The women and children were huddled somewhere out of sight.
  Steel-jacketed bullets cracked on the rocks and whined away. Yaqui knew how
  poor was the marksmanship of the Mexicans; nevertheless it seemed to him they
  were shooting high. The position of the Indians was open to fire from several
  angles.</p>

  <p>During a lull in the firing a hoarse yell pealed out. Yaqui knew Spanish.
  "Surrender, Yaquis!" was the command. The Yaquis answered by well-aimed
  bullets that brought sharp cries from the soldiers. Soon the encampment
  appeared entirely surrounded. Reports came from all sides and bullets
  whistled high, spatting into the trees. Then occurred another lull in the
  firing. Again a voice pealed out: "Surrender, Yaquis, save your lives!"</p>

  <p>The Indians recognized their doom. Each man had only a few shells for his
  gun. Many had only bows and arrows. They would be shot like wolves in a trap.
  But no Yaqui spoke a word.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when darkness put an end to their shooting there were only a
  few who had a shell left. The Mexicans grasped the situation and grew bold.
  They built fires off under the trees. They crept down to the walls and threw
  stones into the encampment and yelled derisively: "Yaqui dogs!" They kept up
  a desultory shooting from all sides as if to make known to the Indians that
  they were surrounded and vigilantly watched.</p>

  <p>At dawn the Mexicans began another heavy volleying, firing into the
  encampment without aim but with deadly intent. Then, yelling their racial
  hatred of the Yaquis, they charged the camp. It was an unequal battle.
  Outnumbered and without ammunition the Yaquis fought a desperate but losing
  fight. One by one they were set upon by several, sometimes by half a dozen,
  Mexicans and killed or beaten into insensibility.</p>

  <p>Yaqui formed the center of several storms of conflict. With clubbed rifle
  he was like a giant fighting down a horde of little men.</p>

  <p>"Kill the big devil!" cried a soldier.</p>

  <p>From the thick of that melee sounded Spanish curses and maledictions and
  dull thuds and groans as well. The Yaqui was a match for all that could
  surround him. A Mexican fired a pistol. Then the officer came running to
  knock aside the weapon. He shouted to his men to capture the Yaqui chief. The
  Mexicans pressed closer, dodging the sweeping rifle, and one of them plunged
  at the heels of the Indian. Another did likewise and they tripped up the
  giant, who was then piled upon by a number of cursing soldiers. Like a mad
  bull Yaqui heaved and tossed, but to no avail. He was overpowered and bound
  with a lasso, and tied upright to the paloverde under which he had so often
  rested.</p>

  <p>His capture ended the battle. And the Mexicans began to run about,
  searching. Daylight had come. From under a ledge of rock the Indian women and
  children were driven. One lithe, quick boy eluded the soldiers. He slipped
  out of their hands and ran. As he looked back over his shoulder his dark face
  shone wildly. It was Yaqui's son. Like a deer he ran, not heeding the stern
  calls to halt. "Shoot!" ordered the officer. Then the soldiers leveled rifles
  and began to fire. Puffs of dust struck up behind, beside and beyond that
  flying form. But none hit him. They shot at him until he appeared to be out
  of range. And all eyes watched him flee. Then a last bullet struck its flying
  mark. The watchers heard a shrill cry of agony and saw the lad fall.</p>

  <p>All the Indians were tied hand and foot and herded into a small space and
  guarded as if they had been wild cattle.</p>

  <p>After several hours of resting and feasting and celebrating what
  manifestly was regarded as a great victory, the officer ordered the capture
  of horses and the burning of effects not transportable. Soon the beautiful
  encampment of the Yaquis was a scene of blackened and smoking ruin. Then,
  driving the Yaquis in a herd before them, the Mexicans, most of them now
  mounted on Indian horses, faced the ascent of the slope by which they had
  entered the valley.</p>

  <p>Far down that ragged mountain slope the Mexicans halted at the camp they
  had left when they made their attack on the Yaquis. Mules and burros,
  packsaddles and camp duffel occupied a dusty bench upon which there grew a
  scant vegetation. All round were black slopes of ragged lava and patches of
  glistening white cholla.</p>

  <p>The Yaquis received but little water and food, no blankets to sleep on, no
  rest from tight bonds, no bandaging of their fly-tormented wounds. But they
  bore their ills as if they had none.</p>

  <p>Yaqui sat with his back to a stone and when unobserved by the guards he
  would whisper to those of his people nearest to him. Impassively but with
  intent faces they listened. His words had some strange, powerful, sustaining
  effect. And all the time his inscrutable gaze swept down off the lava heights
  to the hazy blue gulf of the sea.</p>

  <p>Dawn disclosed the fact that two of the Yaquis were badly wounded and
  could not be driven to make a start. Perhaps they meant to force the death
  that awaited them farther down the trail; perhaps they were absorbed in the
  morbid gloom of pain and departing strength. At last the officer, weary of
  his subordinate's failure to stir these men, dragged at them himself, kicked
  and beat them, cursing the while. "Yaqui dogs! You go to the henequen
  fields!"</p>

  <p>The older of these wounded Indians, a man of lofty stature and mien,
  suddenly arose. Swiftly his brown arm flashed. He grasped a billet of wood
  from a packsaddle and struck the officer down. The blow lacked force. It was
  evident that the Yaqui, for all his magnificent spirit, could scarcely stand.
  Excitedly the soldiers yelled, and some brandished weapons. The officer
  staggered to his feet, livid and furious, snarling like a dog, and ordering
  his men to hold back, he drew a pistol to kill the Yaqui. The scorn, the
  contempt, the serenity of the Indian, instead of rousing his respect,
  incurred a fury which demanded more than death.</p>

  <p>"You shall walk the cholla torture!" he shrieked, waving his pistol in the
  air.</p>

  <p>In northwest Mexico, for longer than the oldest inhabitant could remember,
  there bad been a notorious rumor of the cholla torture that the Yaquis meted
  out to their Mexican captives. This cholla torture consisted of ripping the
  skin off the soles of Mexicans' feet and driving them to walk upon the cactus
  beds until they died.</p>

  <p>The two wounded Indians, with bleeding raw feet, were dragged to the
  cholla torture. They walked the white, glistening, needle-spiked beds of
  cholla blind to the cruel jeers and mute wonderment and vile maledictions of
  their hereditary foes. The giant Yaqui who had struck down the officer
  stalked unaided across the beds of dry cholla. The cones cracked like live
  bits of steel. They collected on the Yaqui's feet until he was lifting pads
  of cactus. He walked erect, with a quivering of all the muscles of his naked
  bronze body, and his dark face was set in a terrible hardness of scorn for
  his murderers.</p>

  <p>Then when the mass of cactus cones adhering to the Yaqui's feet grew so
  heavy that he became anchored in his tracks the Mexican officer, with a fury
  that was not all hate, ordered his soldiers to dispatch these two Indians,
  who were beyond the reach of a torture hideous and appalling to all Mexicans.
  Yaqui, the chief, looked on inscrutably, towering above the bowed heads of
  his women.</p>

  <p>This execution sobered the soldiers. Not only extermination did they mean
  to mete out to the Yaqui, but an extermination of horrible toil, by which the
  Mexicans were to profit.</p>

  <p>Montes, a Brazilian, lolled in the shady spot on the dock. The hot sun of
  Yucatan was more than enough for him. The still air reeked with a hot pungent
  odor of henequen. Montes had learned to hate the smell. He was in Yucatan on
  a mission for the Brazilian government and also as an agent to study the
  sisal product&mdash;an advantageous business for him, to which he had devoted
  himself with enthusiasm and energy.</p>

  <p>But two unforeseen circumstances had disturbed him of late and rendered
  less happy his devotion to his tasks. His vanity had been piqued, his pride
  had been hurt, his heart had been stormed by one of Merida's coquettish
  beauties. And the plight of the poor Yaqui Indians, slaves in the henequen
  fields, had so roused his compassion that he had neglected his work.</p>

  <p>So, as Montes idled there in the shade, with his legs dangling over the
  dock, a time came in his reflection when he was confronted with a choice
  between the longing to go home and a strange desire to stay. He gazed out
  into the gulf. The gunboat Esyeranza had come to anchor in the roads off
  Progreso. She had a cargo of human freight&mdash;Yaqui Indian prisoners from
  the wild plateaus of Northern Sonora&mdash;more slaves to be broken in the
  terrible henequen fields. At that moment of Montes's indecision he espied
  Lieutenant Perez coming down the dock at the head of a file of rurales.</p>

  <p>Gazing at Perez intently, the Brazilian experienced a slight cold shock of
  decision. He would prolong his stay in Yucatan. Strange was the nameless
  something that haunted him. Jealous curiosity, he called it, bitterly. Perez
  had the favor of the proud mother of Seqorita Dolores Mendoza, the coquettish
  beauty who had smiled upon Montes. She cared no more for Perez than she cared
  for him or any of the young bloods of Merida. But she would marry Perez.</p>

  <p>Montes rose and stepped out of the shade. His commission in Yucatan put
  him on common ground with Perez, but he had always felt looked down upon by
  this little Yucatecan.</p>

  <p>"Buenos dias, seqor," replied Perez to his greeting. "More Yaquis."</p>

  <p>A barge was made fast to the end of the dock and the Yaquis driven off and
  held there in a closely guarded group.</p>

  <p>The time came when Perez halted the loading of henequen long enough to
  allow the prisoners to march up the dock between files of rurales. They
  passed under the shadows of the huge warehouses, out into a glaring square
  where the bare sand radiated veils of heat.</p>

  <p>At an order from Perez, soldiers began separating the Yaqui women and
  children from the men. They were formed in two lines. Then Perez went among
  them, pointing out one, then another.</p>

  <p>Montes suddenly grasped the significance of this scene and it had strange
  effect upon him. Yaqui father and son&mdash;husband and wife&mdash;mother and
  child did not yet realize that here they were to be parted&mdash;that this
  separation was forever. Then one young woman, tall, with striking dark face,
  beautiful with the grace of some wild creature, instinctively divined the
  truth and she cried out hoarsely. The silence, the stoicism of these Indians
  seemed broken. This woman had a baby in her arms. Running across the aisle of
  sand, she faced a huge Yaqui and cried aloud in poignant broken speech. This
  giant was her husband and the father of that dusky-eyed baby. He spoke, laid
  a hand on her and stepped out. Perez, who had been at the other end of the
  aisle, saw the movement and strode toward them.</p>

  <p>"Back, Yaqui dogs!" he yelled stridently, and he flashed his bright
  sword.</p>

  <p>With tremendous stride the Yaqui reached Perez and towered over him.</p>

  <p>"Capitan, let my wife and child go where Yaqui goes," demanded the Indian
  in deep voice of sonorous dignity. His Spanish was well spoken. His bearing
  was that of a chief. He asked what seemed his right, even of a ruthless
  enemy.</p>

  <p>But Perez saw nothing but affront to his authority. At his order the
  rurales clubbed Yaqui back into his squad. They would have done the same for
  the stricken wife, had she not backed away from their threatening advances.
  She had time for a long agonized look into the terrible face of her husband.
  Then she was driven away in one squad and he was left in the other.</p>

  <p>Montes thought he would forever carry in memory the tragic face of that
  Yaqui's wife. Indians had hearts and souls the same as white people. It was a
  ridiculous and extraordinary and base thing to be callous to the truth.
  Montes had spent not a little time in the pampas among the Gauchos and for
  that bold race he had admiration and respect. Indeed, coming to think about
  it, the Gauchos resembled these Yaquis. Montes took the trouble to go among
  English and American acquaintances he had made in Progreso, and learned more
  about this oppressed tribe.</p>

  <p>The vast plateau of northwestern Mexico, a desert and mountainous region
  rich in minerals, was the home of the Yaquis. For more than one hundred and
  sixty years there had been war between the Yaquis and the Mexicans. And
  recently, following a bloody raid credited to the Yaquis, the government that
  happened to be in power determined to exterminate them. To that end it was
  hunting the Indians down, killing those who resisted capture, and sending the
  rest to the torture of the henequen fields.</p>

  <p>But more interesting was the new information that Montes gathered. The
  Yaquis were an extraordinary, able-bodied, and intelligent people. Most of
  them spoke Spanish. They had many aboriginal customs and beliefs, but some
  were Roman Catholics. The braves made better miners and laborers than white
  men. Moreover, they possessed singular mechanical gifts and quickly learned
  to operate machines more efficiently than most whites. They possessed
  wonderful physical development and a marvelous endurance. At sixty years
  Yaquis had perfectly sound white teeth and hair as black as night. These
  desert men could travel seventy miles on foot in one day with only a bag of
  pinole. Water they could do without for days. And it was said that some of
  the Yaqui runners performed feats of speed, strength, and endurance beyond
  credence. Montes, remembering the seven-foot stature of that Yaqui chief and
  the spread of shoulders and the wonder of his spare lithe limbs, thought that
  he could believe much.</p>

  <p>The act of Perez in deliberately parting the chief from his loved ones was
  cruel and despicable; and it seemed to establish in Montes's mind an excuse
  for the disgust and hate he had come to feel for the tyrannical little
  officer. But, being frank with himself, Montes confessed that this act had
  only fixed a hate he already had acquired.</p>

  <p>The Brazilian convinced himself that he had intuitively grasped a portent
  apparently lost on Perez. One of those silent, intent-faced Yaquis was going
  to kill this epauleted scion of a rich Yucatecan house. Montes had read it in
  these faces. He had lived among the blood-spilling Gauchos and he knew the
  menace of silent fierce savages. And he did not make any bones about the
  admission to himself that he hoped some Yaqui would kill the peacocked
  Mexican. Montes had Spanish in him, and something of the raw passion of the
  Gauchos he admired; and it suited him to absorb this morbid presentiment. The
  Yaqui chief fascinated him, impelled him. Montes determined to learn where
  this giant had been sent and to watch him, win his confidence, if such a
  thing was possible. Quiin sabe? Montes felt more reasons than one for his
  desire to get under the skin of this big Yaqui.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>In the interior of Yucatan there were vast barren areas of land fit only
  for the production of henequen. Nothing but jungle and henequen would grow
  there. It was a limestone country. The soil could not absorb water. It soaked
  through. Here and there, miles apart, were cenotes, underground caverns full
  of water, and usually these marked the location of a hacienda of one of the
  rich planters. The climate was hot, humid, and for any people used to high
  altitudes it spelled death.</p>

  <p>The plantation of Don Sancho Perez, father of the young lieutenant,
  consisted of fifty thousand acres. It adjoined the hundred-thousand-acre
  tract of Donna Isabel Mendoza. The old Don was ambitious to merge the
  plantations into one, so that he could dominate the fiber output of that
  region. To this end he had long sought to win for his son the hand of Donna
  Isabel's beautiful daughter.</p>

  <p>The big Yaqui Indian who had been wantonly separated from his wife by
  young Perez was in the squad of prisoners that had been picked out by the
  young officer to work on his father's plantation.</p>

  <p>They were manacled at night and herded like wild beasts into a pen and
  watched by armed guards. They were routed out at dawn and put to work in the
  fiber fields. For food they had, each of them, a single lump of coarse soggy
  bread&mdash;one lump once every day. When the weaker among them began to lag,
  to slow down, to sicken, they were whipped to their tasks.[*]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Recently the Mexican government changed its policy
  toward peon labor in Yucatan, and the Yaquis in Sonora. These Indians are now
  in the regular Mexican army. (AUTHOR'S NOTE.)]</p>

  <p>Yaqui knew that never again would he see his wife and baby&mdash;never
  hear from them&mdash;never know what became of them. He was worked like a
  galley slave, all the harder because of his great strength and endurance. He
  would be driven until he broke down.</p><a id="ill-06"

    <p class="caption">Yaqui knew that never again would he see his wife and
    baby...</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Yaqui's work consisted of cutting henequen fiber leaves. He had a curved
  machete and he walked down the endless aisles between the lines of great
  century plants and from each plant he cut the lower circle of leaves. Each
  plant gave him a heavy load and he carried it to the nearest one of the hand-
  car tracks that crossed the plantation. The work of other Indians was to push
  hand cars along these tracks and gather the loads.</p>

  <p>It took Yaqui six days to cut along the length of one aisle. And as far as
  he could see stretched a vast, hot, green wilderness with its never-ending
  lines and lanes, its labyrinthine maze of intersecting aisles, its hazy,
  copper-hued horizons speared and spiked by the great bayonet-like leaves. He
  had been born and raised on the rugged mountain plateaus far to the north,
  where the clear, sweet, cold morning air stung and the midday sun was only
  warm to his back, where there were grass and water and flowers and trees,
  where the purple canyons yawned and the black peaks searched the sky. Here he
  was chained in the thick, hot, moist night, where the air was foul, and
  driven out in the long day under a fiery sun, where the henequen reeked and
  his breath clogged in his throat and his eyes were burning balls and his bare
  feet were like rotting hoofs.</p>

  <p>Yaqui knew that never again would he see his wife and baby&mdash;never
  hear from them&mdash;never know what became of them.</p>

  <p>The time came when Montes saw that the Yaqui looked no more toward that
  northland which he would never see again. He dreamed no more hopeless dreams.
  Somehow he knew when his wife and baby were no more a part of him on the
  earth. For something within him died and there were strange, silent voices at
  his elbow. He listened to them. And in the depths of his being there boiled a
  maelstrom of blood. He worked on and waited.</p>

  <p>At night in the close-crowded filthy pen, with the dampness of tropical
  dews stealing in, and all about him the silent prostrate forms of his
  stricken people, he lay awake and waited enduringly through the long hours
  till a fitful sleep came to him. By day in the henequen fields, with the
  furnace blasts of wind swirling down the aisles, with the moans of his beaten
  and failing comrades full in his ears, he waited with a Yaqui's patience.</p>

  <p>He saw his people beaten and scourged and starved. He saw them sicken and
  fail&mdash;wilt under the hot sun&mdash;die in the henequen aisles&mdash;and
  be thrown like dogs into ditches with quicklime. One by one they went and
  when they were nearly all gone another squad took their places. The Yaqui
  recognized Indians of other tribes of his race. But they did not know him. He
  had greatly changed. Only the shell of him was left. And that seemed
  unbreakable, deathless. He did not tell these newcomers to the fields what
  torture lay in store for them. He might have been dumb. He only waited,
  adding day by day, in the horror of the last throes of his old comrades,
  something more to that hell in his blood. He watched them die and then the
  beginning of the end for his new comrades. They were doomed. They were to be
  driven till they dropped. And others would be brought to fill their places,
  till at last there were no Yaquis left. The sun was setting for his race.</p>

  <p>The Yaqui and his fellow toilers had one day of rest&mdash;the Sabbath.
  There was no freedom. And always there were guards and soldiers. Sunday was
  the day of bull fights in the great corral at the hacienda. And on these
  occasions Yaqui was given extra work. Montes knew the Indian looked forward
  to this day. The old Don's son, Lieutenant Perez, would come down from the
  city to attend the fight. Then surely Yaqui fed his dark soul with more
  cunning, more patience, more promise.</p>

  <p>It was the Yaqui's work to help drag disemboweled and dying horses from
  the bull ring and to return with sand to cover up the gory spots in the
  arena. Often Montes saw him look up at the crowded circle of seats and at the
  box where the gray old Don and his people and friends watched the spectacle.
  There were handsome women with white lace over their heads and in whose dark
  and slumberous eyes lurked something the Yaqui knew. It was something that
  was in the race. Lieutenant Perez was there leaning toward the proud
  seqorita. The Indian watched her with strange intensity. She appeared
  indifferent to the efforts of the picadores and the banderilleros, those men
  in the arena whose duty it was to infuriate the bull for the artist with the
  sword&mdash;the matador. When he appeared the beautiful seqorita wakened to
  interest. But not until there was blood on the bright blade did she show the
  fire and passion of her nature. It was sight of blood that quickened her. It
  was death, then, that she wanted to see.</p>

  <p>And last the Yaqui let his gaze rivet on the dark, arrogant visage of
  young Perez. Did not the great chief then become superhuman, or was it only
  Montes's morbid fancy? When Yaqui turned away, did he not feel a promise of
  fulfillment in the red haze of the afternoon sun, in the red tinge of the
  stained sand, in the red and dripping tongue of the tortured bull? Montes
  knew the Yaqui only needed to live long enough and there would be something.
  And death seemed aloof from this Indian. The ferocity of the desert was in
  him and its incalculable force of life. In his eyes had burned a seared
  memory of the violent thrust with which Perez had driven his wife and baby
  forever from his sight.</p>

  <p>Montes's changed attitude evidently found favor in the proud seqorita's
  eyes. She had but trifled with an earnest and humble suitor; to the advances
  of a man, bold, ardent, strange, with something unfathomable in his wooing,
  she was not indifferent. The fact did not cool Montes's passion, but it
  changed him somehow. The Spanish in him was the part that so ardently loved
  and hated; his mother had been French, and from her he had inherited
  qualities that kept him eternally in conflict with his instincts.</p>

  <p>Montes had his living quarters in Merida, where all the rich henequen
  planters had town houses. It was not a long horseback ride out to the
  haciendas of the two families in which Montes had become most interested. His
  habit of late, after returning from a visit to the henequen fields, had been
  to choose the early warm hours of the afternoon to call upon Seqorita
  Mendoza. There had been a time when his calls had been formally received by
  the Donna Isabel, but of late she had persisted in her siesta, leaving Montes
  to Dolores. Montes had grasped the significance of this&mdash;the future of
  Dolores had been settled and there no longer was risk in leaving her alone.
  But Montes had developed a theory that the future of any young woman was an
  uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The Mendoza town house stood in the outskirts of fashionable Merida. The
  streets were white, the houses were white, the native Mayan women wore white,
  and always it seemed to Montes as he took the familiar walk that the white
  sun blazed down on an immaculate city. But there were dark records against
  the purity of Merida and the Yaqui slave driving was one of them. The Mendoza
  mansion had been built with money coining from the henequen fields. It stood
  high on a knoll, a stately white structure looking down upon a formal garden,
  where white pillars and statues gleamed among green palms and bowers of red
  roses. At the entrance, on each side of the wide flagstone walk, stood a huge
  henequen plant.</p>

  <p>On this day the family was in town and Montes expected that the seqorita
  would see him coining. He derived pleasure from the assurance that, compared
  with Perez, he was someone good to look at. Beside him the officer was a
  swarthy undersized youth. But Montes failed to see the white figure of the
  girl and suffered chagrin for his vanity.</p>

  <p>The day was warm. As he climbed the high, wide stone steps his brow grew
  moist and an oppression weighed upon him. Only in the very early morning here
  in Yucatan did he ever have any energy. The climate was enervating. No wonder
  it was that servants and people slept away the warmer hours. Crossing the
  broad stone court and the spacious outside hall, Montes entered the dim,
  dark, musty parlors and passed through to the patio.</p>

  <p>Here all was colorful luxuriance of grass and flower and palm, great still
  ferns and trailing vines. It was not cool, but shady and moist. Only a soft
  spray of falling water and a humming of bees disturbed the deep silence. The
  place seemed drowned in sweet fragrance, rich and subtle, thickening the air
  so that it was difficult to breathe. In a bower roofed by roses lay Seqorita
  Mendoza, asleep in a hammock.</p>

  <p>Softly Montes made his way to her side and stood looking down at her. As a
  picture, as something feminine, beautiful and young and soft and fresh and
  alluring, asleep and therefore sincere, she seemed all that was desirable.
  Dolores Mendoza was an unusual type for a Yucatecan of Spanish descent. She
  was blond. Her hair was not golden, yet nearly so; she had a broad, low,
  beautiful brow, with level eyebrows, and the effect of her closed lids was
  fascinating with their promise; her nose was small, straight, piquant, with
  delicate nostrils that showed they could quiver and dilate; her mouth, the
  best feature of her beauty, was as red as the roses that drooped over her,
  and its short curved upper lip seemed full, sweet, sensuous. She had the oval
  face of her class, but fair, not olive-skinned, and her chin, though it did
  not detract from her charms, was far from being strong. Perhaps her greatest
  attraction, seen thus in the slumber of abandon, was her slender form,
  round-limbed and graceful.</p>

  <p>Montes gazed at her until he felt a bitterness of revolt against the
  deceit of Nature. She gladdened all the senses of man. But somehow she seemed
  false to the effect she created. If he watched her long in this beautiful
  guise of sleep he would deaden his intelligence. She was not for him. So he
  pulled a red rose and pushed it against her lips, playfully tapping them
  until she awoke. Her eyes unclosed. They were a surprise. They should have
  been blue, but they were tawny. Sleepy, dreamy, wonderful cat eyes they were,
  clear and soft, windows of the truth of her nature. Montes suddenly felt safe
  again, sure of himself,</p>

  <p>"Ah, Seqor Montes," she said. "You found me asleep. How long have you been
  here?"</p>

  <p>"A long time, I think," he replied, as he seated himself on a bench near
  her hammock. "Watching you asleep, I forgot time. But alas! time
  flies&mdash;and you awoke."</p>

  <p>Dolores laughed. She had perfect white teeth that looked made to bite and
  enjoy biting. Her smile added to her charm.</p>

  <p>"Sir, one would think you liked me best asleep."</p>

  <p>"I do. You are always beautiful, Dolores. But when you are asleep you seem
  sincere. Now you are&mdash;Dolores Mendoza."</p>

  <p>"Who is sincere? You are not," she retorted. "I don't know you any more.
  You seem to try to make me dissatisfied with myself."</p>

  <p>"So you ought to be."</p>

  <p>"Why? Because I cannot run away with you to Brazil?"</p>

  <p>"No. Because you look like an angel but are not one. Because your beauty,
  your charm, your sweetness deceive men. You seem the incarnation of love and
  joy."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried, stretching out her round arms and drawing a deep breath
  that swelled her white neck. "You are jealous. But I am happy. I have what I
  want. I am young and I enjoy. I love to be admired. I love to be loved. I
  love jewels, gowns, all I have, pleasure, excitement, music, flowers. I love
  to eat. I love to be idle, lazy, dreamy. I love to sleep. And you, horrid
  man, awake me to make me think."</p>

  <p>"That is impossible, Dolores," he replied. "You cannot think."</p>

  <p>"My mind works pretty well. But I'll admit I'm a little animal&mdash;a
  tawny-eyed cat. So, Montes, you must stroke me the right way or I will
  scratch."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd rather you scratched," said Montes. "A man likes a woman who
  loves him tenderly and passionately one moment and tears his hair out the
  next."</p>

  <p>"You know, of course, seqor," she replied mockingly. "The little Alva
  girl, for instance. You admired her. Perhaps she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is adorable," he returned complacently. "I go to her for
  consolation."</p>

  <p>Dolores made a sharp passionate gesture, a contrast to her usual
  languorous movements. Into the sleepy, tawny eyes shot a dilating fire.</p>

  <p>"Have you made love to her?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Dolores, do you imagine any man could resist that girl?" he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Have you?" she repeated with heaving breast.</p>

  <p>Montes discarded his tantalizing lightness. "No, Dolores, I have not. I
  have lived in a torment lately. My love for you seems turning to hate."</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried, extending her hands. She softened. Her lips parted. If
  there were depths in her, Montes had sounded them.</p>

  <p>"Dolores, tell me the truth," he said, taking her hands. "You have never
  been true."</p>

  <p>"I am true to my family. They chose Perez for me to marry&mdash;before I
  ever knew you. It is settled. I shall marry him. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But! Dolores, you love me?"</p>

  <p>She drooped her head. "Yes, seqor&mdash;lately it has come to that. Ah!
  Don't&mdash;don't! Montes, I beg of you! You forget&mdash;I'm engaged to
  Perez."</p>

  <p>Montes released her. In her confession and resistance there was proof of
  his injustice. She was no nobler than her class. She was a butterfly in her
  fancies, a little cat in her greedy joy of physical life. But in her
  agitation he saw a deeper spirit.</p>

  <p>"Dolores, if I had come first&mdash;before Perez&mdash;would you have
  given yourself to me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, seqor, with all my heart!" she replied softly.</p>

  <p>"Dearest&mdash;I think I must ask you to forgive me for&mdash;for
  something I can't confess. And now tell me&mdash;this reception given
  to-morrow by your mother&mdash;is that to announce your engagement to
  Perez?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and I will be free then till fall&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When you will be married?"</p>

  <p>She bowed assent and hesitatingly slid a white hand toward him.</p>

  <p>"Fall! It's a long time. Dolores, I must go back to Brazil."</p>

  <p>"Ah, seqor, that will kill me! Stay!" she entreated.</p>

  <p>"But it would be dangerous. Perez dislikes me. I hate him. Something
  terrible might come of it."</p>

  <p>"That is his risk. I have consented to marry him. I will do my duty before
  and after. But I see no reason why I may not have a little happiness&mdash;of
  my own&mdash;until that day comes. Life for me will not contain all I could
  wish. I told you; now I am happy. But you were included. Seqor, if you love
  me you will remain."</p>

  <p>"Dolores, can you think we will not suffer more?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I know we will afterward. But we shall not now."</p>

  <p>"Now is perilous to me. To realize you love me! I did not think you
  capable of it. Listen! Something&mdash;something might prevent your
  marriage&mdash;or happen afterward. All&mdash;all is so uncertain."</p>

  <p>"Quiin sabe?" she whispered; and to the tawny, sleepy languor of her eyes
  there came a fancy, a dream, a mystic hope.</p>

  <p>"Dolores, if Perez were lost to you&mdash;one way or another&mdash;would
  you marry me?" he broke out huskily. Not until then had he asked her hand in
  marriage.</p>

  <p>"If such forlorn hope will make you stay&mdash;make you happy&mdash;yes,
  Seqor Montes," was her answer.</p>

  <p>There came a time when Yaqui was needed in the factory where the henequen
  fiber was extracted from the leaves. He had come to be a valuable
  machine&mdash;an instrument of toil that did not run down or go wrong. One
  guard said to another: "That big black peon takes a lot of killing!" and then
  ceased to watch him closely. He might have escaped. He might have crossed the
  miles and miles of henequen fields to the jungle, and under that dense cover
  had made his way northward to the coast. Yaqui had many a chance. But he
  never looked toward the north.</p>

  <p>At first they put him to feeding henequen leaves into the maw of a
  crushing machine. The juicy, sticky, odorous substance of the big twenty
  -pound leaf was squeezed into a pulp, out of which came the white glistening
  threads of fiber. These fibers made sisal rope&mdash;rope second in quality
  only to the manila.</p>

  <p>By and by he was promoted. They put him in the pressing room to work on
  the ponderous iron press which was used to make the henequen bales. This
  machine was a high, strange-looking object, oblong in shape, like a box,
  opening in the middle from the top down. It had several distinct movements,
  all operated by levers. Long bundles of henequen were carried in from the
  racks and laid in the press until it was half full. Then a lever was pulled,
  the machine closed on the fiber and opened again. This operation was repeated
  again and again. Then it was necessary for the operator to step from his
  platform upon the fiber in the machine and stamp it down and jump upon it and
  press it closely all round. When this had been done the last time the machine
  seemed wide open and stuffed so full that it would never close. But when the
  lever was pulled the ponderous steel jaws shut closer and closer and locked.
  Then the sides fell away, to disclose a great smooth bale of henequen ready
  for shipment.</p>

  <p>The Yaqui learned to operate this press so skillfully that the work was
  left to him. When his carriers went out to the racks for more fiber he was
  left alone in the room.</p>

  <p>Some strange relation sprang up between Yaqui and his fiber press. For him
  it never failed to operate. He knew to a strand just how much fiber made a
  perfect bale. And he became so accurate that his bales were never weighed.
  They came out glistening, white, perfect to the pound. There was a strange
  affinity between this massive, steel-jawed engine and something that lived in
  the Yaqui's heart, implacable and immutable, appalling in its strength to
  wait, in its power to crush.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>There seemed no failing of the endurance of this primitive giant, but his
  great frame had wasted away until it was a mere hulk. Owing to his value now
  to the hacienda, Yaqui was given rations in lieu of the ball of soggy bread;
  they were not, however, what the Indian needed. Montes at last won Yaqui's
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Seqor, if Yaqui wanted to eat it would be meat he needed," said the
  chief. Then Montes added meat to the wine, bread, and fruit he secretly
  brought to the Indian.</p>

  <p>When Montes began covert kindnesses to the poor Yaqui slaves the chief
  showed gratitude and pathos: "Seqor Montes is good&mdash;but the sun of the
  Yaquis is setting."</p>

  <p>Perez in his triumphant arrogance evidently derived pleasure from being
  magnanimous to the man he instinctively knew was his rival.</p>

  <p>One day at the hacienda when Montes rode up to meet Donna Isabel and
  Dolores he found them accompanied by Perez and his parents. Almost
  immediately the young officer suggested gayly:</p>

  <p>"Seqor, pray carry Dolores off somewhere. My father has something to plan
  with Donna Isabel. It must be a secret from Dolores. Take her a
  walk&mdash;talk to her, seqor&mdash;keep her excited&mdash;make love to
  her!"</p>

  <p>"I shall be happy to obey. Will you come, seqorita?" said Montes.</p>

  <p>If they expected Dolores to pout, they were mistaken. Her slow, sleepy
  glance left the face of her future husband as she turned away silently to
  accompany Montes. They walked along the palm-shaded road, out toward the
  huge, open, sunny space that was the henequen domain.</p>

  <p>"I hate Perez," she burst out suddenly. "He meant to taunt you. He thinks
  I am his slave&mdash;a creature without mind or heart. Seqor, make love to
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You will be his slave&mdash;soon," whispered Montes bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Never!" she exclaimed passionately.</p>

  <p>They readied the end of the shady road. The mill was silent. Montes saw
  the Indian standing motionless close at hand, in the shade of the henequen
  racks.</p>

  <p>"Dolores, did you mean what you just said?" asked Montes eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That I will never be Perez's slave?"</p>

  <p>"No; the other thing you said."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," she replied. "Make love to me, seqor. It was his wish. I
  must learn to obey."</p>

  <p>With sullen scorn she spoke, not looking at Montes, scarcely realizing the
  actual purport of her speech. But when Montes took her in his arms she
  started back with a cry. He held her. And suddenly clasping her tightly he
  bent his head to kiss the red lips she opened to protest.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" she begged wildly. "Oh&mdash;I did
  not&mdash;mean&mdash;Montes, not so! Do not make me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kiss me!" whispered Montes hoarsely, "or I'll never let you go. It was
  his wish. Come, I dare you&mdash;I beg you!"</p>

  <p>One wild moment she responded to his kiss, and then she thrust him
  away.</p>

  <p>"Ah, by the saints!" she murmured with hands over her face. "Now I will
  love you more&mdash;my heart will break."</p>

  <p>"Dolores, I can't let Perez have you," declared Montes miserably.</p>

  <p>"Too late, my dear. I am to be his wife."</p>

  <p>"But you love me, Dolores?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! too true. I do. Oh, I never knew how well!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Let us run away," he implored eagerly.</p>

  <p>Mournfully she shook her head, and looking up suddenly she espied the
  Yaqui. His great burning cavernous eyes, like black fire, were fixed upon
  her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that terrible Yaqui," she whispered. "It is he who watches us at the
  bull fights&mdash;Let us go, Montes&mdash;Oh, he saw us&mdash;he saw
  me&mdash;Come!"</p>

  <p>Upon their return to the house the old Don greeted them effusively. He
  seemed radiant with happiness. He had united two of the first families of
  Yucatan, which unison would make the greatest henequen plantation. The
  beautiful seqorita had other admirers. But this marriage had unusual
  advantages. The peculiar location and productiveness of the plantations and
  the obstacles to greater and quicker output that would be done away with, and
  the fact that Lieutenant Perez through his military influence could work the
  fields with peon labor&mdash;these facts had carried the balance in favor of
  the marriage. The old Don manifestly regarded the arrangement as a victory
  for him which he owed to the henequen, and he had decided to make the wedding
  day one on which the rich product of the plantation should play a most
  important part.</p>

  <p>"But how to bring in the henequen!" he concluded in perplexity. "I've
  racked my brain. Son, I leave it to you."</p>

  <p>Young Perez magnificently waved the question aside. Possessing himself of
  his fiancee's reluctant hand, he spoke in a whisper audible to Montes. "We
  planned the wedding presents. That was the secret. But you shall not
  see&mdash;not know&mdash;until we are married!"</p>

  <p>Montes dropped his eyes and his brow knit thoughtfully. Later, as a peon
  brought his horse, he called Perez aside.</p>

  <p>"I've an idea," he said confidentially. "Have Yaqui select the most
  perfect henequen fiber to make the most beautiful and perfect bale of
  henequen ever pressed. Have Yaqui place the wedding presents inside the bale
  before the final pressing. Then send it to Donna Isabel's house after the
  wedding and open it there."</p>

  <p>Young Perez clapped his hands in delight. What a capital plan! He
  complimented Montes and thanked him and asked him to keep secret the idea.
  Indeed, the young lieutenant waxed enthusiastic over the plan. It would be
  unique; it would be fitting to the occasion. Perez would have Yaqui pick over
  and select from the racks the most perfect fibers, to be laid aside. Perez
  would go himself to watch Yaqui at his work. He would have Yaqui practice the
  operation of pressing, so at the momentous hour there could be no hitch. And
  on the wedding day Perez would carry the presents himself. No hands but his
  own would be trusted with those jewels, especially the exquisite pearls that
  were his own particular gift.</p>

  <p>At last the day arrived for the wedding. It was to be a holiday. Yaqui
  alone was not to lie idle. It was to fall to him to press that bale of
  henequen and to haul it to the bride's home.</p>

  <p>But Perez did not receive all his gifts when he wanted them. Messengers
  arrived late and some were yet to come. He went to the mill, however, and put
  Yaqui to work at packing the henequen in the press and building it up. The
  Indian was bidden to go so far with the bale, leaving a great hole in the
  middle for the gifts and to have the rest of the fiber all ready to pack and
  press. Perez would not trust anyone else with his precious secret; he himself
  would hurry down with the gifts, and secretly, for the manner of presentation
  was to be a great surprise.</p>

  <p>Blue was the sky, white gold the sun, and the breeze waved the palms. But
  for Montes an invisible shadow hovered over the stately Mendoza mansion where
  Dolores was to be made a bride. The shadow existed in his mind and took
  mystic shape&mdash;now a vast, copper-hazed, green-spiked plain of henequen,
  and then the spectral gigantic shape of a toiling man, gaunt, grim, and
  fire-eyed.</p>

  <p>Montes hid his heavy heart behind smiling lips and the speech of a
  courtier. He steeled himself against a nameless and portending shock, waiting
  for it even when his mind scorned the delusion. But the shock did not come at
  sight of Seqorita Dolores, magnificently gowned in white, beautiful, serene,
  imperious, with her proud, tawny eyes and proud, red lips. Nor when those
  sleepy strange eyes met his. Nor when the priest ended the ceremony that made
  her a wife.</p>

  <p>He noted when Lieutenant Perez laughingly fought his way out of the crowd
  and disappeared. Then the unrest of Montes became a haunting suspense.</p>

  <p>By and by the guests were directed out to the shaded west terrace, where
  in the center of the wide stoned space lay a huge white glistening bale of
  henequen. Beside it stood the giant Yaqui, dark, motionless, aloof. The
  guests clustered round.</p>

  <p>When Montes saw the Yaqui like a statue beside the bale of henequen, he
  sustained the shock for which he had been waiting. He slipped to the front of
  the circle of guests.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the old Don, eying the bale of henequen with great
  satisfaction. "This is the surprise our son had in store for us. Here is the
  jewel case&mdash;here are the wedding presents!"</p>

  <p>The guests laughed and murmured their compliments.</p>

  <p>"Where is Seqor Perez?" demanded the Don as he looked round.</p>

  <p>"The boy is hiding," replied Donna Isabel. "He wants to watch his bride
  when she sees the gifts."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he would not be there," declared the old Don in perplexity.
  Something strange edged into his gladness of the moment. Suddenly he wheeled
  to the Yaqui. But he never spoke the question on his lips. Slowly he seemed
  to be blasted by those great black-fired orbs, as piercing as if they had
  been lightnings from hell.</p>

  <p>"Hurry, open the bale," cried the bride, her sweet voice trilling above
  the gay talk.</p>

  <p>Yaqui appeared not to hear. Was he looking into the soul of the father of
  Lieutenant Perez? All about him betrayed almost a superhuman intensity.</p>

  <p>"Open the bale," ordered the bride.</p>

  <p>Yaqui cut the wire. He did not look at her. The perfectly folded and
  pressed strands of fiber shook and swelled and moved apart as if in relief.
  And like a great white jewel case of glistening silken threads the bale of
  henequen opened.</p>

  <p>It commanded a stilling of the gay murmur&mdash;a sudden silence that had
  a subtle effect upon all. The beautiful bride, leaning closer to look, seemed
  to lose the light of the tawny proud eyes. Her mother froze into a creature
  of stone. The old Don, in slow strange action, as if his mind had feeble sway
  over body, bent his gray head away from the gaunt and terrible Yaqui.
  Something showed blue down under the center strands of the glistening fiber.
  With a swift flash of his huge black hand, with exceeding violence, Yaqui
  swept the strands aside. Then from his lips pealed an awful cry. Instead of
  the jewels, there, crushed and ghastly, lay the bridegroom Perez.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">IV.&mdash;TIGRE</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"YES, I've a power over animals. Look at Tigre there! But
  the old women in Micas say I've found one wild thing I'll never tame."</p>

  <p>"And that, seqor?" asked Muella.</p>

  <p>"My young and pretty wife."</p>

  <p>She tossed her small head, so that her black curls rippled in the
  sunlight, and the silver rings danced in her ears.</p>

  <p>"Bernardo, I'm not a parrot to have my tongue slit, or a monkey to be
  taught tricks, or a jungle cat to be trained. I'm a woman, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and I am old," he interrupted bitterly. "Look,
  Muella&mdash;there on the Micas trail!"</p>

  <p>"It's only Augustine, your vaquero."</p>

  <p>"Watch him!" replied Bernardo.</p>

  <p>Muella watched the lithe figure of a man striding swiftly along the trail.
  He was not going to drive cattle up to the corrals, for in that case he would
  have been riding a horse. He was not going toward the huts of the other
  herders. He faced the jungle into which ran the Micas trail.</p>

  <p>Surely he could not be on his way to Micas! The afternoon was far advanced
  and the village many miles away. No vaquero ever trusted himself to the
  dangers of the jungle at night. Even Augustine, the boldest and strongest of
  Bernardo's many herders, would scarcely venture so much. Yet Augustine kept
  on down the trail, passed the thatched bamboo fence, went through the grove
  of palms, and disappeared in the green wall of jungle.</p>

  <p>"He's gone!" cried Bernardo. "Muella, I sent Augustine away."</p>

  <p>She saw a dull red in her husband's cheeks, a dark and sinister gleam in
  his eyes; and her surprise yielded to misgiving.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He loved you."</p>

  <p>No! No! Bernardo, if that's why you sent him away, you've wronged him. Of
  all your vaqueros, Augustine alone never smiled at me&mdash;he cared nothing
  for me."</p>

  <p>"I say he loved you," returned Bernardo hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Bernardo, you are unjust!"</p>

  <p>"Would you lie to me? I know he loves you. Girl, confess that you love
  him. Tell it! I won't bear this doubt another day!"</p>

  <p>Muella stood rigid in his grasp, her eyes blazing the truth that her lips
  scorned to speak.</p>

  <p>"I'll make you tell!" he shouted, and ran to a cage of twisted vines and
  bamboo poles.</p>

  <p>As he fumbled with the fastening of a door, his brown hands shook. A loud
  purr, almost a cough, came from the cage; then an enormous jaguar stepped out
  into the sunlight.</p>

  <p>"Now, girl, look at Tigre!"</p>

  <p>Tigre was of huge build, graceful in every powerful line of his yellow,
  black- spotted body, and beautiful. Still, he was terrible of aspect. His
  massive head swung lazily; his broad face had one set expression of brute
  ferocity.</p>

  <p>The eyes of any jaguar are large, yellow, cold, pale, cruel, but Tigre's
  were frightful. Every instant they vibrated, coalesced, focused, yet seemed
  always to hold a luminous, far-seeing stare. It was as if Tigre was gazing
  beyond the jungle horizon to palm-leaf lairs which he had never seen, but
  which he knew by instinct. And then it was as if a film descended to hide
  their tawny depths. Tigre's eyes changed&mdash;they were always changing,
  only there was not in them the life of vision; for the jaguar was blind.</p>

  <p>Bernardo burst into rapid speech.</p>

  <p>"The taunting old crones of Micas were right when they said I could not
  tame the woman; but I've tamed every wild creature of the Taumaulipas jungle.
  Look at Tigre! Who beside Bernardo ever tamed a jaguar? Look! Tigre is my
  dog. He loves me. He follows me, he guards me, he sleeps under my hammock.
  Tigre is blind, and he is deaf, yet never have I trained any beast so well.
  Whatever I put Tigre to trail, he finds. He never loses. He trails slowly,
  for he is blind and deaf, but he never stops, never sleeps, till he
  kills!"</p>

  <p>Bernardo clutched the fur of the great jaguar and leaned panting against
  the thatch wall of the cage.</p>

  <p>"I'll soon know if you love Augustine!" he went on passionately. "Look
  here at the path&mdash;the path that leads out to the Micas trail. See!
  Augustine's sandal- prints in the dust! Now, girl, watch!"</p>

  <p>He led Tigre to the path and forced the nose of the beast down upon
  Augustine's footmarks. Suddenly the jaguar lost all his lax grace. His long
  tail lashed from side to side. Then, with head low, he paced down the path'
  He crossed the grassy plot, went through the fence, along the trail into the
  jungle.</p>

  <p>"He's trailing Augustine!" cried Muella.</p>

  <p>She felt Bernardo's gaze burning into her face.</p>

  <p>"Tigre will trail him&mdash;catch him&mdash;kill him!" her husband
  said.</p>

  <p>Muella screamed.</p>

  <p>"He's innocent! I swear Augustine does not love me! I swear I don't love
  him! It's a horrible mistake. He'll be trailed&mdash;ah, he'll be torn by
  that blind brute!" Muella leaped back from her husband. "Never! You jealous
  monster! For I'll run after Augustine&mdash;I'll tell him&mdash;I'll save
  him!"</p>

  <p>She eluded Bernardo's fierce onslaught, and, fleet as a frightened deer,
  she sped down the path. She did not heed his hoarse cries, nor his heavy
  footsteps.</p>

  <p>Bernardo was lame. Muella had so little fear of his catching her that she
  did not look back. She passed the fence, sped through the grove, and entered
  the jungle.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>The trail was hard-packed earth, and ahead it lost its white line in the
  green walls. Muella ran swiftly, dodging the leaning branches, bowing her
  head under the streamers of moss, striking aside the slender palm leaves.
  Gay-plumaged birds flitted before her, and a gorgeous butterfly crossed her
  path. A parrot screeched over her head.</p>

  <p>She strained her gaze for the trailing jaguar. Then she saw him, a long
  black and yellow shape moving slowly under the hanging vines and
  creepers.</p>

  <p>When Muella caught up with Tigre, she slackened her pace, and watched for
  a wide place in the trail where she could pass without touching him.</p>

  <p>"I must pass him," she muttered. "He can't hear me&mdash;I can do it
  safely&mdash;I must!"</p>

  <p>But still she did not take advantage of several wide places.</p>

  <p>Presently the trail opened into a little glade. Twice she started forward,
  only to hang back. Then desperately she went on, seeing nothing but the great
  spotted cat just in front of her.</p><a id="ill-07"
        name="ill-07"></a><br>

  <div align="center">

         title="Illustration7">

    <p class="caption">Twice she started forward, only to hang back.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Twice she started forward, only to hang back.</p>

  <p>Sharp spear-point palm leaves stung her face, and their rustling increased
  her terror. She flashed by Tigre so close that she smelled him.</p>

  <p>Muella uttered a broken cry and began to run, as if indeed she were the
  wild creature Bernardo had called her. She looked over her shoulder to see
  the sinuous yellow form disappear round a bend of the trail. Then she
  gathered courage. For a long time her flying feet pattered lightly on the
  trail. She was young, supple, strong, and it took much to tire her. She ran
  on and on, until her feet were heavy, her breath was almost gone, and her
  side pierced by a sharp pain. Then she fell to a walk, caught her breath, and
  once more ran.</p>

  <p>Fears began to beset her. Had Augustine left the trail? How swiftly he had
  walked! It seemed as if she had run several miles. But that was well, for,
  the larger the distance the farther she would get ahead of the jaguar.</p>

  <p>Shadows began to gather under the overhanging vines and creepers. Only the
  tips of the giant ceibas showed a glint of sunlight. The day was fast
  closing. Once more she ran on and on; and then, as she turned a curve, a
  tall, dark form stood out of the green, and blurred the trail.</p>

  <p>"Augustine! Wait! Wait!" she cried.</p>

  <p>The man swung round, and ran back. Muella, panting for breath and with her
  hand pressed over her heart, met him.</p>

  <p>"Seqora! What has happened?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wait! My breath's gone!" she gasped. "Wait! But keep on&mdash;we&mdash;we
  mustn't stop!"</p>

  <p>Muella took a fleeting upward glance at him. It was so hurried that she
  could not be positive, but she thought she had caught a strange, paling flush
  of his bronzed face and a startled look of his dark eyes. Why should his
  meeting her unexpectedly cause more than surprise or concern?</p>

  <p>As she trotted along, she shot another quick glance up at him. He seemed
  unmistakably agitated; and this disconcerted her. She heard his amazed
  questions, but they were mostly unintelligible.</p>

  <p>She had thought of nothing save to catch up with him and to blurt out that
  Tigre was on his trail, and why. The words now halted on her lips. It was not
  easy to tell him. What would he say&mdash;what would he do? A few moments
  back, he had been only one of Bernardo's herders&mdash;the best, truly, and a
  man whom it was pleasing to look upon, but he had been nothing to her. He
  alone of the vaqueros had not smiled at her, and this piquing of her pride
  had gained him notice which otherwise he might never have got.</p>

  <p>As she pattered on, slowly regaining her breath, the presence of the man
  seemed to grow more real. It was well that she knew Augustine cared nothing
  for her, else she could not have told him of Bernardo's unjust
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>The trail opened into a clearing, where there were several old
  palm-thatched huts, a broken-down corral, and a water hole. The place had
  once been used by Bernardo's herders, but was now abandoned and partly
  overgrown. At this point, Augustine, who for a time had silently stalked
  beside Muella, abruptly halted her.</p>

  <p>"Seqora, what is wrong? Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Going!" She uttered a little laugh. "Why, I don't know. I
  followed&mdash;to warn you. Bernardo put Tigre on your trail!"</p>

  <p>"Tigre? Santa Maria!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I ran, and ran, and passed him. He must be far back now. He's slow
  at first, but he's sure, and he's trailing you. Hurry on! You mustn't stop
  here!"</p>

  <p>"Seqora! You ran&mdash;you risked so much to save me? Oh, may our Blessed
  Lady reward you!"</p>

  <p>"Man, I tell you, don't stop. Go on! You have only your machete. Why did
  you start into the jungle without a gun?"</p>

  <p>"Bernardo drove me off. I owned nothing at the hacienda except my blanket
  and machete."</p>

  <p>"He's selfish&mdash;he was beside himself. Why, Augustine, he was jealous.
  He&mdash;he told me he drove you away because you&mdash;you cared for me. I'm
  ashamed to tell you. But, Augustine, he's growing old. You mustn't
  mind&mdash;only hurry to get safe from that terrible brute!"</p>

  <p>"I forgive him, seqora. It's his way to fall in a rage; but he quickly
  repents. And you, seqora&mdash;you must take this old trail back to the
  hacienda. Go swiftly, for soon it will be night."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going back," said Muella slowly. "I won't live any longer with
  Bernardo. Take me to Micas&mdash;to my sister's home!"</p>

  <p>With one long stride Augustine barred the trail and stood over her.</p>

  <p>"You must go back. It's best you should know the truth. Bernardo spoke
  truth when he told you I loved you!"</p>

  <p>"Augustine, you're telling a lie&mdash;just to frighten me back to
  him!"</p>

  <p>"No. Bernardo asked me for the truth; so I told him."</p>

  <p>Muella's eyes dilated and darkened with shadows of amaze, wonder, and
  pain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why did you tell him? I didn't know. Oh, I swore by the Virgin that
  you had no thought of me. He'll believe that I lied."</p>

  <p>"Seqora, you are innocent, and Bernardo will learn it. You know
  him&mdash;how hotheaded he is, how quickly he is sorry. Go back. Take this
  old cattle road&mdash;here&mdash;and hurry. The sun has set. You must run.
  Have no fear for me!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going back to Bernardo." She straightened up, pale and composed,
  but as she stepped forward to pass the vaquero in the trail she averted her
  eyes. "Take me to Micas!"</p>

  <p>With a passionate gesture Augustine stopped her.</p>

  <p>"But, seqora, consider. Darkness is upon us. Micas is a long way. You're
  only a girl. You can't keep up. You've forgotten that Tigre is on my
  trail."</p>

  <p>"I forget nothing," she replied coldly. "I've begged you to hurry."</p>

  <p>"Muella, go back at once. To-morrow&mdash;after a night in the
  jungle&mdash;with me&mdash;you can't go. It'll be too late!"</p>

  <p>"It's too late now," breathed the girl. "I can't go back&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>"Go first, then," he said, whipping out the long machete. "I'll wait here
  for Tigre."</p>

  <p>"Seqor, there are other tigres. There are panthers, too, and wild boars. I
  may lose the trail. Will you let me go alone?"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Augustine whispered the name of a saint, and turning his dark face toward
  where the trail led out of the clearing, he strode on without sheathing his
  machete.</p>

  <p>Muella kept close to him, and entered the enclosing walls of jungle
  verdure. She felt indeed that she was the untamed thing Bernardo had called
  her, and now she was hunted. Light as dropping leaves, her feet pattered in
  the trail. Augustine loomed beside her, striding swiftly, and now and then
  the naked blade he carried, striking against a twig or branch, broke the
  silence with a faint ring.</p>

  <p>The green walls became hovering shadows and turned to gray. Muella had an
  irresistible desire to look back. The darkening menace of the gloom before
  and on each side was nothing to that known peril behind. She saw nothing,
  however, but a dull, gray, wavering line fading into the obscurity of the
  jungle. She strained her hearing. Except for the soft swishing of her skirt
  on the brush, and the occasional low ring of Augustine's machete, there was
  absolutely no sound.</p>

  <p>She noted that her companion never turned his head. Had he no fear? Quick
  flashes of memory recalled stories of this herder's daring. How tall and
  powerful he was&mdash;how swiftly he strode&mdash;how dark and stern and
  silent he seemed! He must know full well the nature of Bernardo's pet, the
  terrible blind brute that never failed on a trail.</p>

  <p>All at once the jungle grew into two ragged walls of black separated by a
  narrow strip of paler shade. Night had fallen; and with it came a blinking of
  stars through dense foliage overhead, and the lighting of fireflies. Insects
  began to hum. Rustlings in the brush augmented Muella's sensitiveness. A
  strange call of a night bird startled her, and instinctively she shrank
  closer to Augustine. She wished to speak to him, to make the silence
  bearable; but stealthy steps off to the right made her heart leap and her
  tongue mute.</p>

  <p>Augustine heard, for he struck the leaves with his machete. From the
  enshrouding blackness came the snapping of twigs, pattering little steps, the
  rush of animals running through grass or ferns, and soft rustlings in the
  brush. Then the night silence awoke to strange cries&mdash;squall of cat and
  scream of panther, squeaks and grunts and squeals of peccaries, and
  inexpressibly wild sounds, too remote to distinguish.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Augustine!" whispered Muella, fear at last unlocking her lips.
  "Listen! All before us&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Seqora, we have not greatly to fear ahead," he replied. "But
  behind&mdash;a trailing tigre warms with the night! We must not lag!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not tired. I can walk so, all night; but the steps, the cries,
  frighten me. It grows darker, and I stumble."</p>

  <p>She fancied she saw him reach out as if to help her, and then draw
  suddenly back. The darkness became so thick that she could scarcely see him.
  Like a tall specter he moved on.</p>

  <p>She groped for his arm, found it, and slipped her hand down to his.
  Instantly she felt his strong fingers convulsively close round hers. The warm
  clasp helped and cheered her.</p>

  <p>So, mile after mile, Muella kept tireless pace with the herder; and when
  the jungle creatures ceased their hue and quest, and the dead silence once
  more settled thickly down, the strange night flight lost its reality and
  seemed a dream. The black shadows lifted and paled to opaque gloom. A
  whiteness stole into the jungle; silver shafts gleamed through the trees. The
  moon was rising. Muella hailed it with joy, for it meant that the night was
  far advanced, and that their way would be lightened.</p>

  <p>Soon all about her was a radiant, encompassing world of silver shadows and
  gleams. It was a beautiful night. The cold fear weighting her heart lessened,
  seemed momentarily to be thrilled and warmed away. She loved that great,
  silver- orbed, golden-circled moon; and now she looked up at it through a
  streaked and fringed and laced web.</p>

  <p>She wondered if Augustine saw the beauty of the sharp-cut palms, the
  delicate- leaved bamboos, and the full-foliaged ceibas, all festooned with
  long silver streamers of moss. Gnarled branches of a dead monarch of the
  forest, silhouetted against the deep blue of the sky, showed orchids and
  aloes and long, strangling vines&mdash;parasites that had killed it. Every
  unshadowed leaf along the trail glistened white with dew. The glamor of the
  white night was upon Muella.</p>

  <p>Augustine's voice broke the spell.</p>

  <p>"You are tiring, but we must not lag. Shall I carry you?"</p>

  <p>"No, no! I can keep up."</p>

  <p>His words and the glint of his naked machete brought her back to
  actuality. She slipped her hand from his.</p>

  <p>Slowly a haze overspread the moon. The brightness failed, and then the
  moonlit patches imperceptibly merged into the shadows, until all was gray.
  The jungle trees rose dim and weird and lost their tips in clouds of mist. A
  chicolocki burst into song, and the broken notes heralded the coming of
  day.</p>

  <p>"Augustine, it is near dawn," said Muella. "Oh, how good the light will
  be! I'm so cold&mdash;so wet. We shall be safe in Micas soon, shall we
  not?"</p>

  <p>The herder mumbled a reply that she did not understand.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>Swiftly upon the gray dawn came the broad daylight. The clouds of creamy
  mist rose and broke and rolled away, letting the sunshine down into the
  jungle. The balmy air rang with the melodies of birds. Flocks of parrots
  passed overhead, screeching discordant clamor.</p>

  <p>Presently it struck Muella that the trail was growing narrow and rough and
  overgrown. She had journeyed to Micas often enough to be familiar with the
  trail, and this, so wild and crooked, was not the right one.</p>

  <p>"Augustine, have you missed the way?" she queried anxiously.</p>

  <p>Briefly he replied that he was making a short cut. Muella did not believe
  him. She walked on, and began again to look back. When she caught Augustine
  doing likewise, she gave way to dread.</p>

  <p>The morning wore on, the sun grew warm, and with the heat of day came the
  jungle flies and mosquitoes. Augustine was inured to their attacks, but
  Muella impatiently fought them, thus adding to her loss of energy.</p>

  <p>When, at the crossing of a network of trails, Augustine chose one at
  random, Muella was certain of the worst. She asked him about it, and he
  admitted he was off the course, but as he was sure of his direction there was
  no need of fear. He assured her that he would have her at her sister's home
  in Micas by noon.</p>

  <p>Noon found them threading a matted jungle where they had to bend low along
  the deer and peccary trails. The character of the vegetation had changed. It
  was now dry, thorny, and almost impenetrable.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Muella jerked her hand away from a swinging branch, which she had
  intended to brush aside.</p>

  <p>"Look, Augustine, on my hand. Garapatas! Ugh, how I loathe them!"</p>

  <p>Her hand and wrist were dotted with great black jungle ticks. Augustine
  removed them, and as he did so, Muella saw his fingers tremble. The
  significance of his agitation did not dawn upon her until she was free of the
  pests, and then she fancied that her touch had so moved him. It was
  wonderful, it warmed her blood, and she stole a glance at him. But Augustine
  was ashen pale; his thoughts were far from the softness and beauty of a
  woman's hand.</p>

  <p>"Augustine! You have lost your way!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Gloomily he dropped his head, and let his silence answer.</p>

  <p>"Lost in the jungle! We're lost! And Tigre is on our trail!" she
  shrieked.</p>

  <p>Panic overcame her. She tottered and fell against him. Her whole slender
  length rippled in a violent trembling. Then she beat her hands frantically on
  Augustine's shoulders, and clutched him tight, and besought him with
  inarticulate speech.</p>

  <p>"Listen, seqora, listen," he kept saying. "If you give up now, I can't
  save you. We're lost, but there's a way out. Listen&mdash;don't tear at me
  so&mdash;there's a way out. Do you hear? You go on alone&mdash;follow these
  deer tracks till you come to water. Soon they'll lead to water. That water
  will be the Santa Rosa. Follow up the stream till you come to Micas. It'll be
  hard, but you can do it."</p>

  <p>"Go on alone! And you?" she said brokenly.</p>

  <p>"I'll turn on our back trail. I'll meet Tigre and stop him."</p>

  <p>"Tigre will kill you!"</p>

  <p>"He is blind and deaf. I shall be prepared. I've a chance, at least, to
  cripple him."</p>

  <p>"At the end of a trail Tigre is a demon. He has been trained to kill the
  thing he's put to trail. You&mdash;with only a machete! Ah, seqor, I've heard
  that you are brave and strong, but you must not go back to meet Tigre. Come!
  We'll follow the deer tracks together. Then if Tigre catches us&mdash;well,
  he can kill us both!"</p>

  <p>"Seqora, I can serve you best by going back."</p>

  <p>"You think that if you took me to Micas the old women would
  talk&mdash;that my good name would be gone?" she asked searchingly.</p>

  <p>"Seqora, we waste time, and time is precious," he protested.</p>

  <p>Muella studied the haggard, set face. This man meant to sacrifice his life
  for her. Deep through the fire of his eyes she saw unutterable pain and
  passion. If she had doubted his love, she doubted no more. He must be made to
  believe that she had followed him, not alone to save him from Tigre, but
  because she loved him. Afterward he would be grateful for her deceit. And if
  her avowal did not break his will, then she would use a woman's charm, a
  woman's sweetness.</p>

  <p>"Seqor, you told Bernardo the truth&mdash;and I lied to him!" she
  said.</p>

  <p>Stranger than all other sensations of that flight was the thrill in her as
  she forced herself to speak.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Augustine.</p>

  <p>"He asked you if you loved me. You told the truth. He asked me if&mdash;if
  I loved you. And&mdash;I lied!"</p>

  <p>"Santa Maria!" the man cried, starting up impulsively. Then slowly he fell
  back. "Seqora, may the saints reward you for your brave words. I know! You
  are trying to keep me from going back. We waste precious time&mdash;go
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Augustine, wait, wait!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Running blindly, she flung herself into his arms. She hid her face in his
  breast, and pressed all her slender, palpitating body close to his. As if he
  had been turned to stone, he stood motionless. She twined her arms about him,
  and her disheveled hair brushed his lips. She tried to raise her
  face&mdash;failed&mdash;tried again, and raised it all scarlet, with eyes
  close shut and tears wet on her cheeks. Blindly she sought his mouth with her
  lips&mdash;kissed him timidly&mdash;tremulously&mdash;and then
  passionately.</p>

  <p>With that, uttering a little gasp, she swayed away and turned from him,
  her head bowed in shame, one beseeching hand held backward to him.</p>

  <p>"Don't go! Don't leave me!"</p>

  <p>"Dios!" whispered Augustine.</p>

  <p>Presently he took the proffered hand, and, leading her, once more plunged
  into the narrow trail.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>For hours Muella walked with lowered eyes. She plodded on, bending her
  head under the branches, and constantly using her free hand to fight the
  pests.</p>

  <p>Her consciousness, for the while, was almost wholly absorbed with a
  feeling of an indefinable difference in herself. She seemed to be in a
  condition of trembling change, as if the fibers of her soul were being unknit
  and rewoven. Something illusive and strange and sweet wavered before
  her&mdash;a promise of joy that held vague portent of pain. This inexplicable
  feeling reminded her of fancies, longings, dreams of her girlhood.</p>

  <p>At length sensations from without claimed full share of Muella's
  attention. The heat had grown intense. She was becoming exhausted. Her body
  burned, and about her ankles were bands of red-hot fire. Still she toiled on,
  because she believed that Micas was close at hand.</p>

  <p>The sun went down, and night approached. There was no sign of water.
  Augustine failed to hide his distress. He was hopelessly lost in the jungle.
  All the trails appeared to lead into the same place&mdash;a changeless yellow
  and gray jungle.</p>

  <p>The flies pursued in humming wheel, and clouds of whining mosquitoes rose
  from the ground. The under side of every leaf, when brushed upward, showed a
  red spot which instantly disintegrated, and spilled itself like a bursting
  splotch of quicksilver upon the travelers. And every infinitesimal red pin
  point was a crawling jungle pest. The dead wood and dry branches were black
  with innumerable garapatas.</p>

  <p>Muella had been born a hill native, and she was not bred to withstand the
  savage attack of the jungle vermin. The time came when she fell, and implored
  Augustine to put her out of her misery with his machete. For answer he lifted
  her gently and moved on, carrying her in his arms.</p>

  <p>Night came. Augustine traveled by the stars, and tried to find trails that
  led him in a general direction northward. By and by Muella's head rolled
  heavily, and she slept.</p>

  <p>At length the blackness and impenetrable thicket hindered his progress. He
  laid Muella down, covered her with his blanket, and stood over her with drawn
  machete till the moon rose.</p>

  <p>The light aiding him, he found a trail, and, taking up his burden, he went
  on. And that night dragged to dawn.</p>

  <p>Muella walked little the next day. She could hardly stand. She had
  scarcely strength to free her hair from the brush as it caught in passing.
  The burning pain of her skin had given place to a dull ache. She felt fever
  stealing into her blood.</p>

  <p>Augustine wandered on, over bare rocks and through dense jungles, with
  Muella in his arms. He was tireless, dauntless, wonderful in his grim
  determination to save her. Worn as she was, sick and feverish, she yet had
  moments when she thought of him; and at each succeeding thought he seemed to
  grow in her impression of strength and courage.</p>

  <p>But most of her thoughts centered on the trailing Tigre. The serpents and
  panthers and peccaries no longer caused Muella concern; she feared only the
  surely gaining jaguar.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>Night closed down on them among tangled mats and labyrinthine webs of
  heavy underbrush.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" whispered Muella suddenly, with great black eyes staring out of
  her white face.</p>

  <p>From far off in the jungle came a sound that was like a cough and growl in
  one.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Augustine, did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Was it a tigre?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"A trailing tigre?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but surely that could not have been Bernardo's. His tigre would not
  give cry on a trail."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Tigre is deaf and blind, and he has been trained, but he has all
  the jungle nature. He has Bernardo's cruelty, too!"</p>

  <p>Again the sound broke on the still night air. Muella slipped to the ground
  with a little gasp. She heard Augustine cursing against the fate that had
  driven them for days under trees, trees, trees, and had finally brought them
  to bay in a corner where there was no tree to climb. She saw him face about
  to the trail by which they had come; and stand there with his naked blade
  upraised. He blocked the dim, narrow passageway.</p>

  <p>An interminable moment passed. Muella stopped breathing, tried to still
  the beating of her heart so that she could listen. There was no sound save
  the low, sad hum of insects and the rustle of wind in leaves. She seemed to
  feel Tigre's presence out there in the blackness. Dark as it was, she
  imagined she saw him stealing closer, his massive head low, his blind eyes
  flaring, his huge paws reaching out.</p>

  <p>A slight rustling checked all motion of her blood. Tigre was there, ready
  to spring upon Augustine. Muella tried to warn him, but her lips were dry and
  dumb. Had he lost his own sense of hearing?</p>

  <p>Her head reeled and her sight darkened; but she could not swoon. She could
  only wait, wait, while the slow moments wore on.</p>

  <p>Augustine loomed over the trail, a dark, menacing figure. Again there came
  a rustling and a stealthy step, this time in another direction; and Augustine
  turned toward it.</p>

  <p>Long silence followed; even the humming of insects and the moaning of the
  wind seemed to grow fainter. Then came more tickings of the brush and a
  padded footfall. Tigre had found them&mdash;was stalking them!</p>

  <p>Muella lay there, helplessly waiting. In the poignancy of her fear far
  Augustine, expecting momentarily to see the huge jaguar leap upon him, she
  forgot herself. There was more in her agony of dread than the sheer primitive
  shrinking of the flesh, the woman's horror of seeing death inflicted. Through
  that terrible age-long flight through the jungle, Augustine had come to mean
  more than a protector to her.</p>

  <p>She watched him guardedly facing in the direction of every soft rustle in
  the brush. He was a man at the end of his resources, ready to fight and die
  for a woman.</p>

  <p>The insects hummed on, the wind moaned in the leaves, the rustlings came
  from one point and another in the brush, but Tigre did not appear. The black
  night lightened and the moon rose. Muella now distinctly saw
  Augustine&mdash;disheveled and ragged, white and stern and wild, with his
  curved blade bright in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>Then the gray mist crept up to obscure the white stars and the moon, and
  at last the blue vault. The rustlings ceased to sound in the brush. From far
  off rasped the cough of a tigre. It appeared to come from the same place as
  when first heard. Hope had new birth in Muella's heart.</p>

  <p>Moments like hours passed; the insects ceased to hum and the wind to moan.
  The gray shadows fled before a rosy dawn.</p>

  <p>Augustine hewed a lane through the dense thicket that had stopped him, and
  presently he came upon a trail. He hurried back to Muella with words of
  cheer. Strength born of hope returned to her, and she essayed to get up.</p>

  <p>Helping her to her feet, he half led and half carried her into the trail.
  They went on for a hundred paces, to find that the path suddenly opened into
  a wide clearing. To Muella it had a familiar look, and Augustine's
  exclamation assured her that he had seen the place before. Then she
  recognized a ruined corral, some old palm-thatched huts, and a water hole as
  belonging to the clearing through which they had long before passed.</p>

  <p>"We've traveled back in a circle!" exclaimed Augustine. "We're near the
  hacienda&mdash;your home!"</p>

  <p>Muella leaned against him and wept. First of all was the joy of
  deliverance.</p>

  <p>"Muella, you are saved," Augustine went on. "The distance is short&mdash;I
  can carry you. Bernardo will forgive&mdash;you know how he flies into a
  passion, and then how he repents."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. I'll go back to him&mdash;tell him the truth&mdash;ask his
  mercy!"</p>

  <p>From the center of the clearing came a rustling of dry leaves, then a loud
  purr, almost a cough. Augustine stiffened, and Muella clutched frantically at
  him.</p>

  <p>For a long moment they stood, dark eyes staring into dark eyes, waiting,
  listening. Then Augustine, releasing his hold on the trembling girl,
  cautiously stepped upon a log and peered over the low palms. Almost instantly
  he plunged down with arms uplifted.</p>

  <p>"Santa Maria! Tigre! He's there!" he whispered. "He's there, beside the
  body of something he's killed. He's been there all night. He was there when
  we first heard him. We thought he was trailing. Muella, I must see closer.
  Stay back&mdash;you must not follow!"</p>

  <p>But as he crept under the low palms she followed him. They came to the
  open clearing. Tigre lay across the trail, his beautiful yellow and black
  body stretched in lax grace, his terrible sightless eyes riveted on a dead
  man beside him.</p>

  <p>"Muella&mdash;stay back&mdash;I fear&mdash;I fear!" said Augustine.</p>

  <p>He crept yet a little farther, and returned with pale face and quivering
  jaw.</p>

  <p>"Muella, it's Bernardo! He's dead&mdash;has been dead for days. When you
  started off that day to warn me, Bernardo must have run round by the old
  wagon road to head off Tigre. The blind brute killed him!"</p>

  <p>"Bernardo repented!" moaned Muella. "He repented!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">V.&mdash;THE RUBBER HUNTER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Popular Magazine</i>, June 15, 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">IQUITOS was a magnet for wanderers and a safe hiding-place
  for men who must turn their faces from civilization. Rubber drew adventurers
  and criminals to this Peruvian frontier town as gold lured them to the
  Klondike.</p>

  <p>Among the motley crowd of rubber hunters boarding the Amazonas for the up-
  river trip was a Spaniard, upon whom all eyes were trained. At the end of the
  gangplank, Captain Valdez stopped him and tried to send him back. The rubber
  hunter, however, appeared to be a man whom it would be impossible to turn
  aside.</p>

  <p>"There's my passage," he shouted. "I'm going aboard."</p>

  <p>No one in Iquitos knew him by any other name than Manuel. He headed the
  list of outlaw rubber hunters, and was suspected of being a slave hunter as
  well. Beyond the Andes was a government which, if it knew aught of the slave
  traffic, had no power on that remote frontier. Valdez and the other boat
  owners, however, had leagued themselves together and taken the law into their
  own hands, for the outlaws destroyed the rubber trees instead of tapping
  them, which was the legitimate work, and thus threatened to ruin the rubber
  industry. Moreover, the slave dealers alienated the Indians, and so made them
  hostile.</p>

  <p>Captain Valdez now looked doubtfully at Manuel. The Spaniard was of
  unusual stature; his cavernous eyes glowed from under shaggy brows; his thin
  beard, never shaven, showed the hard lines of his set jaw. In that crowd of
  desperate men he stood out conspicuously. He had made and squandered more
  money than any six rubber hunters on the river; he drank chicha and had a
  passion for games of chance; he had fought and killed his men.</p>

  <p>"I'm going aboard," he repeated, pushing past Valdez.</p>

  <p>"One more trip, then, Manuel," said the captain slowly. We're going to
  shut down on you outlaws."</p>

  <p>"They're all outlaws. Every man who has nerve enough to go as far as the
  Pachitier is an outlaw. Valdez, do you think I'm a slaver?"</p>

  <p>"You're suspected&mdash;among others," replied the captain warily.</p>

  <p>"I never hunted slaves," bellowed Manuel, waving his brawny arms. "I never
  needed to sell slaves. I always found cowcha more than any man on the
  river."</p>

  <p>"Manuel, I'll take you on your word. But listen&mdash;if you are ever
  caught with Indians, you'll get the chain gang or be sent adrift down the
  Amazon."</p>

  <p>"Valdez, I'll take my last trip on those terms," returned Manuel. "I'm
  going far&mdash;I'll come in rich."</p>

  <p>Soon after that the Amazonas cast off. She was a stern wheeler with two
  decks&mdash;an old craft as rough-looking as her cargo of human freight. On
  the upper deck were the pilot house, the captain's quarters, and a small,
  first-class cabin, which was unoccupied. The twenty-four passengers on board
  traveled second-class, down on the lower deck. Forward it was open, and here
  the crew and passengers slept, some in hammocks and the rest sprawled on the
  floor. Then came the machinery. Wood was the fuel used, and stops were made
  along the river when a fresh supply was needed.</p>

  <p>Aft was the dining saloon, a gloomy hole, narrow and about twelve feet
  long, with benches running on two sides. At meal times, the table was lowered
  from the ceiling by a crude device of ropes and pulleys.</p>

  <p>The night of the departure this saloon was a spectacle. The little room,
  with its dim, smelly lamp and blue haze of smoke, seemed weirdly set between
  the vast reaches of the black river. The passengers crowded there, smoking,
  drinking, gambling. These hunters, when they got together, spoke in very loud
  tones, for in the primeval silence and solitude of the Amazonian wilderness
  they grew unaccustomed to the sound of their own voices. Many languages were
  spoken, but Spanish was the one that gave them general intercourse.</p>

  <p>It was a muggy night, and the stuffy saloon reeked with the odors of
  tobacco and perspiration and the fumes of chicha. The unkempt passengers sat
  coatless, many of them shirtless, each one adding to the din around the
  gambling board.</p>

  <p>Presently the door of the saloon was filled by the form of a powerful man.
  From his white face and blond hair he might have been taken for an
  Englishman. The several gambling groups boisterously invited him to play. He
  had a weary, hunted look that did not change when he began to gamble. He
  played indifferently, spoke seldom, and lost at every turn of the cards.
  There appeared to be no limit to his ill luck or to his supply of money.</p>

  <p>Players were attracted from other groups. The game, the stakes, the din,
  the flow of chicha&mdash;all increased as the night wore on.</p>

  <p>Like the turn of the tide, the silent man's luck changed. After nearly
  every play he raked in the stakes. Darker grew those dark faces about the
  board, and meaning glances glittered. A knife gleamed low behind the winner's
  back, clutched in a lean hand of one of the gamesters. Murder might have been
  done then, but a big arm swept the gamester off his feet and flung him out of
  the door, where he disappeared in the blackness.</p>

  <p>"Fair play!" roared Manuel, his eyes glowing like phosphorus in the dark.
  The sudden silence let in the chug of machinery, the splashing of the paddle
  wheel, the swishing of water. Every eye watched the giant Spaniard. Then the
  game recommenced, and, under Manuel's burning eyes, continued on into the
  night.</p>

  <p>At last he flipped a gold piece on the table and ordered chicha for
  all.</p>

  <p>"Men, drink to Manuel's last trip up the river," he said. "I'm coming in
  rich."</p>

  <p>"Rubber or Indians?" sarcastically queried a weasel-featured Spaniard.</p>

  <p>"Bustos, you lie in your question," replied Manuel hotly. "You can't make
  a slave hunter of me. I'm after rubber. I'll bring in canoes full of
  rubber."</p>

  <p>Most of the outlaws, when they could not find a profitable rubber forest,
  turned their energies to capturing Indian children and selling them into
  slavery in the Amazonian settlements.</p>

  <p>"Manuel, where will you strike out?" asked one.</p>

  <p>"For the headwaters of the Palcazu. Who'll go with me?"</p>

  <p>Few rubber hunters besides Manuel had ever been beyond the junction of the
  Pachitea and the Ucayali; and the Palcazu headed up in the foothills of the
  Andes. Little was known of the river, more than that it marked the territory
  of the Cashibos, a mysterious tribe of cannibals. None of the men manifested
  a desire to become Manuel's partner. He leered scornfully at them, and cursed
  them for a pack of cowards.</p>

  <p>After that night he had little to do with his fellow passengers, used
  tobacco sparingly, drank not at all, and retreated sullenly within himself.
  Manuel never went into the jungle out of condition.</p>

  <p>The Amazonas turned into the Ucayali, and day and night steamed up that
  thousand-mile river, stopping often for fuel, and here and there to let off
  the rubber hunters. All of them bade Manuel good-by with a jocund finality.
  At La Boca, which was the mouth of the Pachitea and the end of Captain
  Valdez's run, there were only three passengers left of the original
  twenty-four&mdash;Bustos, Manuel, and the stranger who seemed to have nothing
  in common with the rubber hunters.</p>

  <p>"Manuel," said Bustos, "you've heard what the Palcazu is&mdash;fatal
  midday sun, the death dews, the man-eating Cashibos. You'll never come in.
  Adios!"</p>

  <p>Then Captain Valdez interrogated Manuel.</p>

  <p>"Is it true you are going out to the Palcazu?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, captain."</p>

  <p>"That looks bad, Manuel. We know Indians swarm up there&mdash;the Chunchus
  of the Pachitea, and farther out the Cashibos. We've never heard of rubber
  there."</p>

  <p>"Would I go alone into a cannibal country if I hunted slaves?"</p>

  <p>"What you couldn't do has yet not been proven. Remember, Manuel&mdash;if
  we catch you with Indian children, it's the chain gang or the Amazon."</p>

  <p>Manuel, cursing low, lifted his pack and went down the gangplank. As he
  stepped upon the dock a man accosted him.</p>

  <p>"Do you still want a partner?"</p>

  <p>The question was put by the blond passenger. Manuel looked at him keenly
  for the first time, discovering a man as powerfully built as himself, whose
  gray eyes had a shadow, and about whom there was a hint of recklessness.</p>

  <p>"You're not a rubber hunter?" asked Manuel.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to go with me? You heard what kind of a country it is
  along the Palcazu?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard. That's why I want to go."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Manuel curiously. "Seqor, what shall I call you?"</p>

  <p>"It's no matter."</p>

  <p>"Very well, it shall be Seqor."</p>

  <p>Manuel carried his pack to a grove of palms bordering the river, where
  there was a fleet of canoes. Capmas Indians lounged in the shade, waiting for
  such opportunity to trade as he presented. Evidently Manuel was a close
  trader, for the willing Indians hauled up several canoes, from which he
  selected one. For a canoe, its proportions were immense; it had been hollowed
  from the trunk of a tree, was fifty feet long, three wide, and as many
  deep.</p>

  <p>"Seqor, I'm starting," said Manuel, throwing his pack into the canoe.</p>

  <p>"Let's be off, then," replied Seqor.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you still want to go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I've taken out strangers to these parts&mdash;and they never came
  back."</p>

  <p>"That's my chance."</p>

  <p>"Seqor, up the Pachitea the breeze seldom blows. It's hot. Sand flies
  humming all day long&mdash;mosquitoes thicker than smoke&mdash;creeping
  insects&mdash;spiders, snakes, crocodiles, poison dews, and fevers&mdash;and
  the Cashibos. If we get back at all, it will be with tons of rubber. I ask no
  questions. I, too, have gone into the jungle and kept my secret. Seqor, do
  you go?"</p>

  <p>Seqor silently offered his hand; and these two, outlaw and wanderer, so
  different in blood and the fortunes of life, exchanged the look that binds
  men in the wilderness. Whereupon Manuel gave one of the eighteen-foot,
  wide-bladed paddles to his companion, and, pushing the canoe off the sand,
  began to pole upstream close to the bank. None but the silent Campas Indians
  saw their departure, and soon they, and the grove of palms, and the thatched
  huts disappeared behind a green bend of the river.</p>

  <p>The Pachitea, with its smooth current, steamed under the sun. The voyagers
  kept close to the shady side. The method of propelling the canoe permitted
  only one to work at a time. Beginning at the bow, he sunk his paddle to the
  bottom, and, holding it firmly imbedded, he walked the length of the canoe.
  When he completed his walk to the stern, his companion had passed to the bow.
  Thus the momentum of their canoe did not slacken, and they made fast
  time.</p>

  <p>Gradually the strip of shade under the full-foliaged bank receded until
  the sun burned down upon them. When the tangled balls of snakes melted off
  the branches, and the water smoked and the paddles were too hot to handle,
  Manuel shoved the canoe into the shade of overhanging vines. It was a time
  when all living things, except the heat-born sand flies, hid from the direct
  rays of the midday sun. While the Spaniard draped a net over the bow of the
  canoe these sand flies hummed by like bullets. Then Manuel motioned his
  comrade to crawl with him under cover, and there they slept away those hours
  wherein action was forbidden.</p>

  <p>About the middle of the afternoon they awoke to resume their journey;
  leisurely at first, and then, as the sun declined, with more energy. Fish and
  crocodiles rippled the surface of the river, and innumerable wild fowl
  skimmed its green width.</p>

  <p>Toward sunset Manuel beached on a sandy bank, where there was a grove of
  siteka trees. He had gone into the jungle at this point and brought out
  rubber. The camp site was now waist deep in vegetation, which Manuel mowed
  down with his machete. Then he built two fires of damp leaves and wood, so
  they would smoke and somewhat lessen the scourge of mosquitoes. After that he
  carried up the charcoal box from the canoe and cooked the evening meal.</p>

  <p>Manuel found it good to unseal the fountain of speech, that always went
  dry when he was alone in the jungle. It took him a little while to realize
  that he did all the talking, that Seqor was a silent man who replied only to
  a direct question, and then mostly in monosyllables. Slowly this dawned upon
  the voluble Spaniard, and slowly he froze into the silence natural to him in
  the wilderness.</p>

  <p>They finished the meal, eating under their head nets, and then sat a while
  over the smoky fires, with the splash of fish and the incessant whining hum
  of mosquitoes in their ears. When the stars came out, lightening the ebony
  darkness, they manned the canoe again, and for long hours poled up the misty
  gloom of the river.</p>

  <p>In the morning they resumed travel, slept through the sweltering noon, and
  went on in the night. At the end of the fifth day's advance, Manuel pointed
  out the mouth of a small tributary.</p>

  <p>"So far I've been. Beyond here all is strange to me. White men from Lima
  have come down the river; but of those who have gone up farther than this,
  none have ever returned."</p>

  <p>What a light flashed from the eyes of his partner! Manuel was slow to see
  anything singular in men. But this served to focus his mind on the strangest
  companion with whom he had ever traveled.</p>

  <p>Seqor was exceedingly strong and implacably tireless; a perfect fiend for
  action. He minded not the toil, nor the flies, nor the mosquitoes, nor the
  heat; nothing concerned him except standing still. Seqor never lagged, never
  shirked his part of the labor, never stole the bigger share of food, which
  was more than remarkable in the partner of a rubber hunter.</p>

  <p>So Manuel passed through stages of attention, from a vague stirring of
  interest to respect and admiration, and from these to wonder and liking,
  emotions long dormant within him. The result was for him to become absorbed
  in covert observation of his strange comrade.</p>

  <p>Seqor ate little, and appeared to force that. He slept only a few hours
  every day, and his slumbers were restless, broken by turning and mumbling.
  Sometimes Manuel awakened to find him pacing the canoe or along a sandy strip
  of shore. All the hot hours of their toil he bent his broad shoulders to the
  paddle, wet with sweat. Indeed, he invited the torture of the sun and flies.
  His white face, that Manuel likened to a woman's, was burned red and bitten
  black and streaked with blood.</p>

  <p>When Manuel told him to take the gun and kill wild fowl, he reached
  instinctively for it with the action of a man used to sport, and then he drew
  back and let his companion do the shooting. He never struck at one of the
  thousands of snakes, or slapped at one of the millions of flies, or crushed
  one of the millions of flies, or one of the billions of mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>When Manuel called to Seqor, as was frequently necessary in the management
  of the canoe, he would start as if recalled from engrossing thought. Then he
  would work like an ox, so that it began to be vexatious for Manuel to find
  himself doing the lesser share. Slowly he realized Seqor's intensity, the
  burning in him, the tremendous driving power that appeared to have no
  definite end.</p>

  <p>For years Manuel had been wandering in wild places, and, as the men with
  whom he came in contact were brutal and callous, answering only to savage
  impulses, so the evil in him, the worst of him, had risen to meet its like.
  But with this man of shadowed eye Manuel felt the flux and reflux of old
  forces, dim shades drawn from old memories the painful resurrection of dead
  good, the rising of the phantom of what had once been the best in him.</p>

  <p>The days passed, and the Pachitea narrowed and grew swifter, and its green
  color took on a tinge of blue.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" cried Manuel. "The Palcazu is blue. We must be near the mouth.
  Listen."</p>

  <p>Above the hum of the sand flies rose a rumble, like low thunder, only a
  long, unending roll. It was the roar of rapids. The men leaned on their
  paddles and trudged the length of the canoe, steadily gliding upstream,
  covering the interminable reaches, winding the serpentine bends. The rumble
  lulled and swelled, and then, as they turned a bend, burst upon their ears
  with clear thunder. The Palcazu entered the larger river by splitting round a
  rocky island. On one side tumbled a current that raced across the Pachitea to
  buffet a stony bluff. On the other side sloped a long incline of beautiful
  blue-green water, shining like painted glass.</p>

  <p>Manuel poled up the left shore as far as possible, then leaped out to wade
  at the bow. Seqor waded at the stern, and thus they strove against the
  current. It was shallow, but so swift that it made progress laboriously slow,
  and it climbed in thin sheets up the limbs of the travelers. Foot by foot
  they ascended the rapid, at last to surmount it and beach the canoe in a
  rocky shore.</p>

  <p>"Water from the Andes!" exclaimed Manuel. "It's years since I felt such
  water. Here's a bad place to float a canoe full of rubber."</p>

  <p>"You'll have jolly sport shooting this rapid," replied Seqor.</p>

  <p>"We're entering Cashibos country now. We must eat fish&mdash;no firing the
  guns."</p>

  <p>Wild cane grew thick on the bank; groves of the white sitekas led to the
  dark forest where the giant capirona trees stood out, their tall trunks bare
  and crimson against the green; and beyond ranged densely wooded hills to far
  distant purple outline of mountains or clouds.</p>

  <p>"There's cowcha here, but not enough," said Manuel.</p>

  <p>They rested, as usual during the blistering noon hours, then faced up the
  Palcazu. Before them stretched a tropical scene. The blue water reflected the
  blue sky and the white clouds, and the hanging vines and leaning
  orchid-tufted, creeper-covered trees. Green parrots hung back downward from
  the branches, feeding on pods; macaws of gaudy plumage wheeled overhead;
  herons of many hues took to lumbering flight before the canoe.</p>

  <p>The placid stretch of river gave place to a succession of rapids, up which
  the men had to wade. A downpour of rain joined forces with the stubborn
  current in hindering progress. The supplies had to be covered with palm
  leaves; stops had to be made to bail out the canoe; at times the rain was a
  blinding sheet. Then the clouds passed over and the sun shone hot. The rocks
  were coated with a slime so slippery that sure footing was impossible.</p>

  <p>Manuel found hard wading; and Seqor, unaccustomed to such locomotion, slid
  over the rocks and fell often. The air was humid and heavy, difficult to
  breathe; the trees smoked and the river steamed. Another chute, a mill race
  steep as the ingenuity of the voyagers, put them to tremendous exertions.
  They mounted it and rested at the head, eyes down the glancing descent.</p>

  <p>"What jolly sport you'll have shooting that one!" exclaimed Seqor; and he
  laughed for the first time; not mirthfully, rather with a note that rang
  close to envy.</p>

  <p>Manuel gazed loweringly from under his shaggy brows. This was the second
  time Seqor had spoken of the return trip. Manuel's sharpening wits divined a
  subtle import&mdash;Seqor's consciousness that for himself there would be no
  return. The thing fixed itself on Manuel's mind and would not be shaken.
  Blunt and caustic as he was, something withheld his speech; he asked only
  himself, and knew the answer. Seqor was another of those men who plunge into
  the unbroken fastnesses of a wild country to leave no trace. Wanderers were
  old comrades to Manuel. He had met them going down to the sea and treading
  the trails; and he knew there had been reasons why they had left the comforts
  of home, the haunts of men, the lips of women. Derelicts on the drifting
  currents had once been stately ships; wanderers in the wilds had once swung
  with free stride on sunny streets.</p>

  <p>"He's only another ruined man," muttered Manuel, under his breath. "He's
  going to hide. After a while he will slink out of the jungle to become like
  all the others&mdash;like me!"</p>

  <p>But Manuel found his mind working differently from its old habit; the
  bitterness that his speech expressed could not dispel a yearning which was
  new to him.</p>

  <p>While making camp on a shelf of shore he was absorbed in his new thoughts,
  forgetting to curse the mosquitoes and ants.</p>

  <p>When the men finished their meal, twilight had shaded to dusk. Owing to
  the many rapids, travel by night had become impossible. Manuel drooped over
  one smoky fire and Seqor sat by another. After sunset there never was any
  real silence in the jungle. This hour was, nevertheless, remarkably quiet. It
  wore, shaded, blackened, into wild, lonely night. The remoteness of that spot
  seemed to dwell in the sultry air, in the luminous fog shrouding the river,
  in the moving gloom under the black trees, in the odor of decaying vegetable
  life.</p>

  <p>Manuel nodded and his shoulders sagged. Presently Seqor raised his head,
  as if startled.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he whispered, touching his comrade's arm.</p>

  <p>Then in the semidarkness they listened. Seqor raised his head net above
  his ears.</p>

  <p>"There! Hear it?" he breathed low. "What on earth&mdash;or in hell? What
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing," replied Manuel.</p>

  <p>Seqor straightened his tall form and stood with clenched hands.</p>

  <p>"If that was fancy&mdash;then&mdash;" He muttered deep in his chest. All
  at once he swayed to one side. And became strung in the attitude of
  listening. "Again! Hear it! Listen!"</p>

  <p>Out of the weird darkness wailed a soft, sad note, to be followed by
  another, lower, sweeter, and then another still fainter.</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing." repeated Manuel. This time, out of curiosity and
  indefinable portent, he lied.</p>

  <p>"No! You're sure?" asked Seqor huskily. He placed a shaking hand on
  Manuel. "You heard no cry&mdash;like&mdash;like&mdash;" He drew up sharply.
  "Perhaps I only thought I heard something&mdash;I'm fanciful at times."</p>

  <p>He stirred the camp fire and renewed it with dry sticks. Evidently he
  wanted light. A slight blaze flickered up, intensifying the somber dusk. A
  vampire bat wheeled in the lighted circle. Manuel watched his companion,
  studying the face, somehow still white through the swollen fly blotches and
  scorch of sun, marveling at its expression. What had Seqor imagined he had
  heard?</p>

  <p>Again the falling note! Clearer than the clearest bell, sweeter than the
  saddest music, wailed out of a succession of melancholy, descending tones, to
  linger mournfully, to hold the last note in exquisite suspense, to hush away,
  and leave its phantom echo in the charged air. A woman, dying in agony and
  glad to die, not from disease or violence, but from unutterable woe, might
  have wailed out that last note to the last beat of a broken heart.</p>

  <p>Seqor gripped Manuel's arm.</p>

  <p>"You heard that&mdash;you heard it? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that what you meant? Surely I heard it," replied Manuel. "That's
  only the Perde-alma."</p>

  <p>"Perde-alma?" echoed Seqor.</p>

  <p>"Bird of the Lost Soul. Sounded like a woman, didn't it? We rubber hunters
  like his song. The Indians believe he sings only when death is near. But that
  signifies nothing. For above the Pachitea life and death are one. Life is
  here, and a step there is death! Perde-alma sings seldom. I was years on the
  river before I heard him."</p>

  <p>"Bird of the Lost Soul! A bird! Manuel, I did not think that cry came from
  any living thing."</p>

  <p>He spoke no more, and paced to and fro in the waning camp-fire glow,
  oblivious to the web of mosquitoes settling on his unprotected head.</p>

  <p>Manuel pondered over the circumstance till his sleepy mind refused to
  revolve another idea. In the night he awoke and knew from the feeling of his
  unrested body that he had not slept long. He had been awakened by his comrade
  talking in troubled slumber.</p>

  <p>"Lost soul&mdash;wandering&mdash;never to return! Yes! Yes! But oh let me
  forget! Her face! Her voice! Could I have forgotten if I had killed her?
  Driven, always driven&mdash;never to find&mdash;never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So Seqor cried aloud, and murmured low, and mumbled incoherently, till at
  last, when the black night wore gray, he lay silent.</p>

  <p>"A woman!" thought Manuel. "So a woman drove him across the seas to the
  Palcazu. Driven&mdash;driven! How mad men are!"</p>

  <p>Seqor had turned his face from his world, to drift with the eddying stream
  of wanderers who follow no path and find no peace, to be forgotten, to end in
  evil, to die forlorn&mdash;all for a woman.</p>

  <p>In the darkness of this Peruvian forest, Seqor lay amid the crawling
  vermin unconsciously muttering of a woman. Night spoke aloud thoughts deep
  hidden by day. Seqor had a sailor's eye, a soldier's mien; he had not shrunk
  from the racking toil, the maddening insects, the blood-boiling heat; he was
  both strong and brave; yet he was so haunted by a woman that he trembled to
  hear the fancied voice of his ghost of love in the wailing note of a jungle
  bird. That note was the echo of his haunting pain. Seqor's secret was a
  woman.</p>

  <p>Manuel understood now why he had been inexplicably drawn to this man. A
  ghost had risen out of his own dead years. It rolled back time for Manuel,
  lifting from the depths a submerged memory, that, like a long-sunken bell,
  rang the muffled music of its past.</p>

  <p>Out of the gray jungle gloom glided the wraith of one he had loved long
  ago. She recalled sunny Spain&mdash;a grassy hill over the blue
  bay&mdash;love&mdash;home&mdash;dark in his inner eye. And the faint jungle
  murmuring resembled a voice. Thus after absence of years, Manuel's ghost of
  love and life had come to him again. It had its resurrection in the agony of
  his comrade. For Manuel there was only that intangible feeling, the sweetness
  of remembered pain. Life had no more shocks to deal him, he thought; that
  keen ache in the breastbone, that poignant pang could never again be his.
  Manuel was life worn. He felt an immunity from further affliction, and
  consciousness of age crept across the line of years.</p>

  <p>How different from other mornings in the past was the breaking of this
  gray dawn! The mist was as hard to breathe, the humidity as oppressive, the
  sun as hot, and the singing spiteful, invisible, winged demons stung with the
  same teeth of poisoned fire&mdash;all the hardship of jungle travel was as
  before, yet it seemed immeasurably lessened.</p>

  <p>For many years Manuel had slaved up these smoky rivers, sometimes with men
  who hated him, and whom he learned to hate. But no man could have hated
  Seqor. In these enterprises of lonely peril, where men were chained together
  in the wilderness, with life strained to the last notch, there could be no
  middle course of feeling. A man must either hate his companion and want to
  kill him, or love him and fight to save him.</p>

  <p>So Manuel loved Seqor, and laughed at the great white wonder of it,
  lightening it all; and once again the sealed fountain of his speech broke and
  flowed. Back in the settlement chicha had always loosed Manuel's tongue,
  liberated wild mirth, incited fierce passions; here in the jungle the
  divining of another's pain, such as had seared him years before, pierced to
  the deeps of his soul, and brought forth kind words that came haltingly
  through lips long grimly set to curse.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of that new kinship, Seqor looked in amaze upon his
  changed comrade, and asked if he had fever. Manuel shook his shaggy head.
  Seqor then fell silent; but he listened, he had to listen, and, listening,
  forgot himself. A new spirit fused the relation of these men.</p>

  <p>"Seqor, we are hunters," said Manuel. "I for gold that I do not want and
  shall easily find, you for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace, Manuel, peace, that I ceaselessly want, but will never find."</p>

  <p>Onward the voyagers poled and waded up the blue Palcazu. The broken waters
  held them to five miles a day. Only giants could have made even so many. The
  slimy rocks over which floundered the hydra-headed balls of snakes, the
  stench of hot ponds behind the bars, the rush of current to be fought inch by
  inch, the torrents of rain, the bailing of the canoe, the merciless heat, and
  the ever-whirling, steel-colored bands of venomous flies&mdash;these made day
  a hell, rest a time of pain, sleep a nightmare; but the hunters, one grim,
  the other gay, strengthened with the slow advance.</p>

  <p>Often Manuel climbed the banks, to return saying there was cowcha, more
  than he had seen, yet still not enough. They must go higher, to richer soil.
  They camped where sunset overtook them. As they sat over the smoky fires or
  fished in the river or lay side by side under the tent, Manuel talked. He had
  gone over the vast fund of his wilderness knowledge, experience in that
  sun-festered world, stories of river and jungle, of fights and fevers.
  Circling back on his seafaring life, as castaway, mariner, smuggler, he
  dredged memory of the happenings of those years till he reached the
  catastrophe that had made him a wanderer.</p>

  <p>"What made me a caucho outlaw?" he queried, whipping his big hand through
  the flying swarm about his face. "A woman! What sends most wandering men down
  the false trails of the world? What drove you, comrade? Perhaps a woman!
  Quien sabe? I loved a girl. She had eyes like night&mdash;lips of
  fire&mdash;she was as sweet as life. See my hand tremble! Seqor, it was years
  ago&mdash;five, maybe ten, I don't remember&mdash;what are years? We were
  married, and had a cottage on a grassy hill above the bay, where the wind
  blew, and we could see the white ripples creeping up the sand. Then a sailor
  came from over the sea; a naval man, Seqor, of your country. He had seen the
  world; lie could fascinate women&mdash;and women change their love. She
  walked with me along the beach in the twilight. The wind tossed her hair. I
  repeated gossip, accused her of loving this man I had never seen. She
  acknowledged her love; proudly, I thought bravely; surely without shame.
  Seqor, with these same hands I forced her to her knees, stifled her
  cry&mdash;and slowly, slowly watched the great staring eyes grow fixed and
  awful&mdash;the lips fall wide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You strangled her?" burst from Seqor in passionate force.</p>

  <p>"I was a fiend," went on the Spaniard. "I felt nothing except that her
  love had changed. I fled over the seas. For long my mind was dark, but
  clearness came, and with it truth. How I knew it I can't say&mdash;these
  things abide in mystery&mdash;but my girl was innocent. Then hell gaped for
  me. Burning days&mdash;endless nights under the hateful stars&mdash;no
  rest&mdash;her last cry, like the Perde-alma, Seqor&mdash;her great, wide
  eyes&mdash;the beat, the beat, the eternal beat of pain, made him you see a
  thing of iron and stone.</p>

  <p>"What was left, Seqor? Only a wild life. You see the wanderer with crimes
  on him thick as his gray hairs. Ah! What I might have done&mdash;might have
  been! I see that in your eyes. What a man might have been! Holy Mercy! A
  braver part no man ever had chance to play. I could have left her free. I
  would not have heard the hound of remorse ever baying my trail. I could have
  hidden like a stricken deer, and died alone. But I was a blind coward. Men
  see differently after years go by. What is love? What is this thing that
  makes one woman all of life to a man? Constant or fickle, she is fair to him.
  Bound or free, she answers to nameless force.</p>

  <p>"Where did you&mdash;all this happen?" asked Seqor hurriedly and low.</p>

  <p>"It was at Malaga, on the Mediterranean."</p>

  <p>Seqor stalked off into the gloom, whispering.</p>

  <p>Manuel did not notice his comrade's agitation; he was in the rude grip of
  unfamiliar emotions. His story had been a deliberate lie, yet it contained
  truth enough to recall the old feeling out of its grave. He thought he had
  divined Seqor's secret, his sacrifice, the motive behind his wandering in a
  God- forsaken land. He believed it was to leave a woman free and to forget.
  He felt the man's burning regret that he had not spilled blood in vengeance.
  So he had lied, had made himself a murderer, that by a somber contrast Seqor
  might see in forgiveness and mercy the nobler part.</p>

  <p>Deep in Manuel's bitter soul he knew how he had lied&mdash;for that woman
  of his youth had not been innocent; he had not harmed her, and he had left
  her free. Seqor would believe his fabricated tragedy, and, looking on this
  hulk of a man, this wandering wretch, haunted by what he might have been,
  and, thanking God for his clean hands, might yet see the darkness
  illumined.</p>

  <p>More days the hunters poled and pulled up the Palcazu, to enter, at
  length, the mouth of a deep estuary coming in from the north.</p>

  <p>This water was a blue-green reflection of sky and foliage. It was a
  beautiful lane, winding between laced and fringed, woven and flowered walls.
  The heavy perfume of overluxuriance was sickening. Life was manifold. The
  estuary dimpled and swelled and splashed&mdash;everywhere were movements and
  sounds of water creatures. Gorgeous parrots screeched from the trailing
  vines; monkeys chattered from the swishing branches. Myriads of
  bright-plumaged birds, flitting from bank to bank, gave the effect of a
  many-colored net stretched above the water. Dreamy music seemed to soar in
  the rich, thick atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The estuary widened presently into a narrow, oval lake, with a sandy shore
  on the north. Crocodiles basked in the sun, and, as Manuel turned the canoe
  shoreward, they raised themselves on stumpy legs, jaws wide, grotesque and
  hideous, and lunged for the water.</p>

  <p>"Cayman! I never saw so many," exclaimed Manuel, striking right and left
  with his paddle. "Where I find caymans, there's always cowcha. Seqor, I
  believe here is the place."</p>

  <p>They ascended the bank, and threaded a maze of wild cane rising to higher
  ground. The soil was a rich alluvial. Manuel dug into it with his hands, as
  if, indeed, he expected to find gold there. The ridge they mounted was not
  thickly forested. Manuel made two discoveries&mdash;they were on the
  borderland of the eastern Andes, and all about them were rubber trees.
  Whether or not Manuel cared for the fortune represented by one hundredth part
  of the rubber he could see, certain it was that he ran from one tree to
  another clasping each in a kind of ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"Iquitos will go mad," he cried. "A thousand tons of cowcha in sight! It's
  here. Look at the trees&mdash;fifty, sixty feet high! Seqor, we shall go in
  rich, rich, rich!"</p>

  <p>They packed the supplies up from the river to escape the sand flies, and
  built a shack, elevating it slightly on forked sticks to evade the marching
  ants and creeping insects. Inside the palm-leaf walls they hung the net,
  fitting it snugly in the cramped space. By clearing away the underbrush and
  burning the ground bare, they added still more to the utility of their camp
  site, and, as far as it was possible in that jungle, approached comfort.</p>

  <p>A troop of monkeys took refuge in the tops of some palms and set up a
  resentful chattering; parrots and macaws swelled the unwelcoming chorus; a
  boa wound away from the spot, shaking a long line of bushes; and an anteater
  ran off into the sitekas.</p>

  <p>Manuel caught up his gun, making as if to pursue the beast, then slowly
  laid the weapon down.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten. We're in Cashibos country now. I've seen no signs, but we
  had best be quiet. At that we may have to shoot the jaguars. They stalk a
  man."</p>

  <p>The rubber hunters worked from dawn till the noonday heat, rested through
  the white, intense hours, resumed their tasks in the afternoon, and continued
  while the light lasted. The method of honest rubber hunters was to tap a tree
  in the evening and visit it the next morning to get the juice. This was too
  slow a process for Manuel&mdash;as it took several days for a flow of a few
  ounces.</p>

  <p>He was possessed with exceeding skill in the construction of clay vessels
  to catch the milky juice and in extracting rubber. He carried water from the
  river and fashioned large clay repositories, one for so many rubber trees;
  also he made small vessels and troughs. These baked hard in the sun. Then he
  cut the trees so the sap would flow freely. They would die; but that was of
  no moment to the outlaw. He had brought a number of kettles, in which he made
  a thick steam by heating palm nuts. Taking a stick with a clay mold on the
  end, he dipped it first in the milk, and then dried the milk in the stream.
  From a vessel full of milk, he got one third its weight in rubber.</p>

  <p>"Seqor," he said proudly, "I can make a hundred pounds of rubber in a
  day."</p>

  <p>It was a toil-filled time, in which the united efforts of Manuel and Seqor
  were given to making an immense cargo of rubber. Swiftly the days passed into
  weeks, the weeks summed months, and the rainy season was at hand. Soon the
  rubber hunters must expect a daily deluge, a flooded, sticky forest,
  intolerable humidity, and sun like an open furnace door.</p>

  <p>Manuel awoke from his lust for rubber.</p>

  <p>"The canoe won't hold another layer," he said. "She'll be loggy enough
  now. We can rest and drift clear to Iquitos. How good! We must be
  starting."</p>

  <p>Like a flitting shadow, a strange, sad smile crossed Seqor's face. Its
  meaning haunted Manuel, and recalled the early days of the trip, before the
  craze for rubber had driven all else from his mind. A wonderful change had
  come over Seqor. He gave all his strength to the gathering of rubber, but no
  longer with a madness for sheer action. He no longer invited the torture of
  the stinging pests. He ate like a hungry man, and his sleep was untroubled.
  Even his silence had undergone change. The inward burning, the intensity of
  mind forever riveted upon the thing that had been the dividing spear of his
  life, had given place to austere tranquillity.</p>

  <p>Other enlightenment flashed into Manuel's darksome thought. The fancy grew
  upon him that he had come to be to Seqor what Seqor was to him. He sensed it,
  felt it, finally realized it.</p>

  <p>Pondering this man's deep influence, he tried to judge what it meant.
  Something shook his pulse, some power from without; some warm, living thing
  drew him to Seqor. It was more than the intimate bond of men of like caliber,
  alone in the wilds, facing peril carelessly, dependent upon one another. Too
  subtle it was for Manuel, too mysterious for his crude reasoning; always it
  kept aloof, in the fringe of his mind. He floundered in thought, and seemed
  to go wandering in the realms of imagery, to become lost in memory, where the
  unreal present mingled with the actual past, through both of which ran
  Seqor's baffling, intangible hold on his heartstrings.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I've got a touch of fever," he soliloquized.</p>

  <p>Another day went by, and still he hesitated to speak the word for
  departure. More and more the task grew harder, for added watching, thought,
  realization, strengthened his conviction that Seqor intended to remain alone
  on the Palcazu. Had the man come to hide in the jungle, to face his soul in
  the solitude, to forget in the extremes of endurance? Yes, but more! He
  sought the end&mdash;annihilation!</p>

  <p>Manuel had never feared to use his tongue, yet now he could not speak. It
  was midday, and he lay beside Seqor in the shack, sheltered from the torrid
  heat. Usually absolute silence prevailed at this hour. On this day, however,
  gentle gusts of wind beat the fronds of the palms. What a peculiar sound! It
  had no similarity to the muffled beating of the heart heard in the ear; yet
  it suggested that to Manuel, and wrought ominously upon his superstition.</p>

  <p>He listened. Sudden, soft gust&mdash;gentle beat, beat, beat hastening at
  the end! Was it the wind? How seldom had he heard wind in the jungle! Was it
  the fronds of the palms or the beating of his heart or of Seqor's? His blood
  did beat thick in his ears. Then a chill passed over him, a certainty of some
  calamity about to be, beyond his comprehension; and he wrenched decision out
  of his wavering will, and swore that he would start down the Palcazu on the
  morrow, if not with this strange companion, then alone.</p>

  <p>Manuel fell into a doze. He awakened presently, and sat up, drowsy and
  hot. He was alone in the shack. Then a hand protruded under the flap of the
  netting and plucked at him.</p>

  <p>"Hurry! Hurry!" came the hoarse whisper. "Don't speak&mdash;don't make a
  noise!"</p>

  <p>Wide awake in a second, Manuel swept aside the flap and straightened up
  outside. Seqor stood very close to him. On the instant, low, whirring sounds
  caught his ear. From the green wall of cane streaked little things that he
  took for birds. Bright and swift the glints of light shot through the yellow
  sunshine. All about him they struck with tiny, pattering thuds and spats.
  Suddenly the shack appeared to be covered with quivering butterflies. They
  were gaudy, feathered darts from blowguns of the cannibals.</p>

  <p>"Cashibos!" yelled Manuel.</p>

  <p>"Run! Run!" cried Seqor. He thrust his coat over Manuel and turned him
  with a violent push. "Run for the river!"</p>

  <p>The frenzy of his voice and will served almost to make Manuel act
  automatically. But he looked back, then stood with suspended breath and
  leaden feet.</p>

  <p>Bronze shadows darted through the interstices of the cane. Then the open
  sunlight burnished small, naked savages, lean, wild, as agile and bounding as
  if they were made of the rubber of their jungle home.</p>

  <p>Seqor jerked Manuel's machete from a log of firewood, and rushed to meet
  them. His back was covered with gaudy butterfly darts. The sight held Manuel
  stricken in his tracks. Seqor had made his broad body a shield, had stood
  buffer between his comrade and the poisoned darts of the Cashibos.</p>

  <p>Like a swarm of copper bees shining in the sun, the cannibals poured out
  of the cane, incredibly swift and silent, leveling their blowguns and
  brandishing their spears.</p>

  <p>Seqor plunged at them, sweeping the machete. A row of nimble bodies wilted
  before him, went down as grain before a scythe. Again the blade swept
  backward, to whistle forward and describe a circle through tumbling,
  copper-colored bodies.</p>

  <p>Rooted in horror, Manuel saw the first spear point come out of Seqor's
  back. Another and another! They slipped out as easily as if coming through
  water. Seqor dropped the machete, and swaying, upheld by spears, he broke
  that silent fight with a terrible cry. It pealed out, piercingly shrill with
  pain, horrible in its human note of death, but strange and significant in its
  ringing triumph. Then he fell, and the Cashibos hurdled his body.</p>

  <p>Animal instinct to survive burst the bonds that held Manuel as paralyzed.
  One leap carried him behind the shack, another into the cane, where he sprang
  into headlong flight. The cane offered little resistance to his giant bounds.
  Soon he reached the bank of the river. The canoe was gone. Rows of caymans
  lay along the beach. So swiftly he leaped down that he beat them into the
  water. Then, drawing Seqor's coat tight around his head and shoulders, he
  plunged out with powerful strokes.</p>

  <p>He had gained the middle of the estuary, when he saw arrowy gleams glance
  before him. Like hissing hail, a shower of darts struck the water. Then it
  seemed that gaudy butterflies floated about his face. Diving deep, he swam
  until compelled to rise for breath.</p>

  <p>As he came up, a crocodile rolled menacingly near. Manuel hit it a blow
  with his fist, and dove again. The coat hindered rapid swimming under water.
  He rose again to hear the crocodile swirling behind him. Darts splashed big
  drops on his cheeks, tugged at his head covering, streaked beyond him to
  skitter along the surface of the estuary.</p>

  <p>Reaching shallow water, he crawled into the reeds. White-mouthed snakes
  struck at him. The bank was low and overhung with rank growths. Manuel
  scrambled through to the solid ground; and then turned to have a look at his
  pursuers.</p>

  <p>Up and down the sandy beach a hundred or more Cashibos were running. How
  wild they were, how springy and fleet! How similar to the hungry, whirling
  sand flies! For a moment the disturbed caymans threshed about in the estuary,
  holding the cannibals back. Presently several of the most daring waded in
  above the commotion; then others entered below.</p>

  <p>Manuel breasted the dense jungle. Before him rose an apparently
  impenetrable wall of green. He dove into it, tore through it, leaving a trail
  of broken branches, twisted vines, and turned leaves. In places he ran
  encumbered by clinging creepers; in others he parted the thick growths with
  his hands and leaped high to separate them. Again he bent low to crawl along
  the peccary trails.</p>

  <p>Despite the obstacles, he went so swiftly that the jungle pests could not
  get at him; the few which did could not keep their hold, because of the
  scraping brush. Soon he ran out of a vine-webbed canebrake into a grove of
  sitekas, rubber trees, and palms. At every bound he sank into the moist
  earth, still he kept on running. He heard a scattering of animals before him,
  and saw a blur of flapping birds.</p>

  <p>The day seemed to darken. He looked up to see trees branching at a height
  of two hundred feet, and intermingling their foliage to obscure sun and sky.
  Here was the dim shade of the great forest of the Amazon tributaries.
  Sheering off to the right, he ran until the clinging earth clogged his
  feet.</p>

  <p>The forest was like a huge, dim hall full of humming life. Lines of
  shrieking monkeys hung on the ropelike vines that reached from the ground to
  green canopy overhead. Birds of paradise sailed like showers of gold through
  the thick, hazy air. Before him fled boas, peccaries, ant-eaters, spotted
  cats, and beasts that he could not name.</p>

  <p>Manuel chose the oozy ground, for there the underbrush was not higher than
  his knees. On and on he wallowed through the moist labyrinth of intricate
  thickets, of aisles lined by the red capironas, of peccary trails worn in the
  earth, of glades starry with exquisite orchids. A fragrance of nauseous
  sweetness, like that of rotting jessamine and tuberose, mingled with fetid
  odor of wet, hot earth, of ripe life and luxuriance. The forest was steeped
  in a steam from overheat, overmoisture, overgrowth.</p>

  <p>The gloom deepened. Somewhere back of Manuel rasped out the cough of a
  jaguar. He quickened his weary steps, soon to strike rising ground and pass
  out of the dark forest into groves of sitekas. The day was waning. He
  ascended a ridge, following the patches of open ground where the baked clay
  shone white. This hard ground would hide his trail from the cannibals, but he
  had no hope of eluding the jaguars. Still, he could climb out of reach of the
  hunting cats. It was the little, winged devils, the tiny, creeping fiends
  that most menaced his life.</p>

  <p>He strode on till the shadows warned him of approaching night. Selecting a
  group of palms with tops interlocking, he climbed one, and perched in the
  midst of the stems of the leaves. Laboriously he broke stem after stem, bent
  and laid them crosswise in the middle of the tree. Then he straddled another
  stem, let his feet hang down, and lay back upon the rude floor he had
  constructed. Finally, wrapping head and face in Seqor's coat and hiding his
  hands, he composed himself to rest.</p>

  <p>He was dripping wet, hot as fire, pulsating, seething, aching, his whole
  body inflamed. Gradually the riot of his nerves, the race of hot blood
  subsided and cooled. Night set in, and the jungle awoke to the hue and cry of
  its bloody denizens. Mosquitoes swarmed around his perch with a continuous
  hum not unlike the long, low roll of a drum. Huge bats whizzed to and fro,
  brushing the palm leaves. Light steps on the hard clay, rustling of brush and
  snapping of twigs attested to the movement of peccaries. These sounds
  significantly ceased at the stealthy, padded tread of a jaguar. From distant
  points came the hungry snarl, the fighting squall, the ominous cough of the
  jungle cats.</p>

  <p>Sometime late in the night Manuel fell asleep. When he awoke the fog
  clouds were mustering, bulging, mushrooming all in a swirl as they lifted.
  Like a disk of molten silver, the sun glared through the misty curtain. The
  drip, drip, drip of dew was all the sound to break the silence. Manuel's
  cramped muscles made descending to the ground an awkward task.</p>

  <p>He estimated that his flight had taken him miles into the interior.
  Evidently for the time being he had eluded the Cashibos. However, his
  situation was gravely critical, and he would never be safe until he got clear
  of Palcazu territory. It was impossible for him to protect himself from the
  jungle parasites. His instant and inflexible determination was to make his
  way back to the river, find his canoe, or steal one from the cannibals, and,
  failing both, lash some logs together and trust to the current.</p>

  <p>The rains were due; soon the rivers would be raging floods; he would make
  fast time. Manuel had no fear of starvation, of the deadly heat, the fatal
  dews, the rainy season fever, or of the Cashibos. What he feared was the
  infernal flies, ticks, ants, mosquitoes&mdash;the whole blood-sucking horde.
  Well he knew that they might bite him blind, poison his blood, drive him mad,
  actually kill him before he got out of the jungle.</p>

  <p>As he was about to start, a small leather pocketbook fell from Seqor's
  coat. Manuel picked it up. He saw again those broad shoulders covered with
  the gaudy butterfly darts. He drew his breath with a sharp catch. Fingering
  the little book, unaccountably impelled, he opened it. Inside was a
  picture.</p>

  <p>He looked down into the dark, challenging eyes, the piquant, alluring face
  of the woman who had been his sweetheart wife!</p>

  <p>Manuel smiled dreamily. How clear was the vision! But almost instantly he
  jerked up his head, hid the picture, and gazed furtively about him, trembling
  and startled. The glaring jungle was no lying deceit of the fancy.</p>

  <p>Slowly he drew forth the picture. Again the proud, dark eyes, the sweet
  lips, the face arch with girl's willfulness, importunate with woman's
  charm!</p>

  <p>Manuel shifted his straining gaze to Seqor's coat.</p>

  <p>"Seqor! He was the man&mdash;that sailor from over the sea&mdash;whom she
  loved at Malaga! What does it all mean? I felt his secret&mdash;I
  lied&mdash;I hatched that murderous story to help him. But he knew I did not
  kill her!"</p>

  <p>Manuel pitched high his arms, quivering, riven by the might of the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"He recognized me! He knew me all the time! He saved my life!"</p>

  <p>Manuel fell backward and lay motionless, with his hands shutting out the
  light. An hour passed. At last he arose, half dazed, fighting to
  understand.</p>

  <p>With Seqor's coat and the picture before him, he traced the wonderful
  association between them and him. There were the plain facts, as clear in his
  sight as the pictured face of the woman who had ruined him, but they were
  bewildering: he could feel but not comprehend them. They obscured their
  meaning in mystery, in the inscrutable mystery of human life. He had freed
  her, had left her to be happy with the man she loved.</p>

  <p>Had she betrayed him, too? It was not impossible that a woman who had
  ceased to love one man would cease to love his successor. Some subtle meaning
  pervaded the atmosphere of that faded coat, that leather book, that woman's
  face, with its smile, and by the meaning Manuel knew Seqor had suffered the
  same stunning stroke that had blighted him. Seqor had cried out in the night:
  "Oh God, let me forget!"</p>

  <p>It was the same story&mdash;hell in the mind, because one day on a woman's
  face shone that mysterious thing, a light, a smile for him alone, and on the
  next day it vanished. Fever in the blood, madness to forget, wandering, a
  hunt for peace, and the wasting years&mdash;how he knew them!</p>

  <p>Manuel thought of Seqor, of his magnificent strength, of the lion in him
  as he sprang to meet the Cashibos, of the gaudy butterfly darts imbedded in
  his back, of the glory and pathos of his death. What his life might have
  been! A strung cord snapped in Manuel's breast; his heart broke. Bitter salt
  tears flowed for Seqor, for himself, for all miserable wretches for all time.
  In that revealing moment he caught a glimpse of the infinite. He saw the
  helplessness of man, the unintelligible fatality of chance, motive, power,
  charm, love&mdash;all that made up the complexity of life.</p>

  <p>How little it mattered, from the view of what made life significant to
  him, that he was a rubber hunter, lost in the jungle, hunted by cannibals,
  tortured by heat, thirst, hunger, vermin! His real life was deep-seated in
  the richly colored halls of memory; and when he lived at all, it was when he
  dreamed therein. His outside existence, habits of toil, and debauchery were
  horrors that he hated. On the outside he was a brutalized rubber hunter,
  unkempt and unwashed, a coarse clod, given over to gaming and chicha. In that
  inner life he lived on a windy hill, watching white sails on a blue sea,
  listening to a woman's voice.</p>

  <p>But some change had come that would now affect his exterior life;
  something beautiful crowned the hideous span of years. His companionship with
  Seqor had softened him, and the tragedy, with its divine communication of
  truth, was a lightning flash into the black gulf of his soul.</p>

  <p>By its light he felt pity for her, for Seqor, for himself, for all who
  lived and loved and suffered. By its light he divined the intricate web and
  tangle and cross and counter-cross of the instincts and feelings of human
  nature&mdash;all that made love transient in one heart, steadfast in another,
  fleeting as the shadow of a flitting wing&mdash;wonderful, terrible,
  unquenchable as the burning sun.</p>

  <p>By its light he saw woman, the mother of life, the source of love, the
  fountain of joy, the embodiment of change&mdash;nature's tool to further her
  unfathomable design, forever and ever to lure man by grace and beauty, to win
  him, to fetter him in unattainable, ever-enthralling desires. By its light he
  saw himself another man, a long-tried, long-failing man, faithful to his
  better self at the last.</p>

  <p>Manuel set forth toward the river, keeping in the shade of trees, walking
  cautiously, with suspicious eyes ever on the outlook. He walked all day,
  covering twice the distance he calculated he had fled inland. When night
  fell, he went on by the light of the stars until the fog obscured them. The
  rest of the night he walked round a tree with covered head. In the morning
  the sun rose on the side he had thought was west. He had become lost in the
  jungle.</p>

  <p>Heretofore panic had always seized him on a like occasion; this time it
  did not. Taking the direction he thought right, he pressed on till the midday
  sun boiled his blood. Succulent leaves and the pith of small palms served as
  food. He moistened his parching mouth with the sap of trees. Lying down, he
  covered himself with the coat and a pile of brush and slept; then awoke to
  trudge on, fighting the flies.</p>

  <p>He entered the great jungle forest, and sought his back trail, but did not
  find it. Swampy water allayed his thirst, and a snake served for meat. The
  jaguars drove him out of the forest. He began to wander in a circle; and that
  night and the following day and the next were but augmented repetitions of
  what had gone before.</p>

  <p>The rains did not come. The fronds of the palms beat in the still air.
  Manuel heard in them a knell. Bitten blind, flayed alive by pests, he fell at
  last with clouded mind. The whizzing wheel of flies circled lower; the armies
  of marching ants spread over him; the red splotches of ticks on the leaves
  spilled themselves upon him like quicksilver. He crawled on through the hot
  bushes. The light of his mind wavered, and he raved of infernal fires. He was
  rolling in fire; forked tongues of flame licked at his flesh; red sparks ate
  into his brain. Down, down under the heated earth, through hot vapors blown
  by fiery gusts! It was a jungle with underbrush of flame, trees in the image
  of pillars of fire, screeching red monkeys in service as imps, birds of
  dazzling coals; and over all and under all and through all a vast humming
  horde of living embers that bit with white-hot teeth.</p>

  <p>As Manuel's reason flickered, ready to go out forever, the rain descended,
  and it cooled him and washed him clean of insects. It slaked his thirst and
  soothed his blinded eyes. At length the tropical cloudburst roared away,
  leaving the jungle drenched. Manuel followed a rushing stream of water that
  he knew would lead him to the river. In him resurged effort and
  resistance.</p>

  <p>By nightfall he had come to the border of cane. Like an eel through grass,
  he slipped between the stalks to the river. On the opposite shore faint
  lights twinkled. At first he took them for fireflies. But dark forms moving
  across the lights told him he had stumbled upon an encampment of the
  Cashibos.</p>

  <p>The river seemed uneasy, stirring. It was rising fast. By dawn it would be
  bank full with a swift current. Under the pale stars the water shimmered,
  steely black in the shade of overhanging shore, dead silver in the center,
  where the fish swirled and the crocodiles trailed dimpling wakes.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Manuel stepped into the water, noiselessly sinking
  himself to his neck. With his ear level with the surface, he subordinated
  every sense to that of hearing. The river was a sounding board, augmenting
  the faint jungle sounds. Crossing would be as safe for him then as it would
  ever be.</p>

  <p>Grim as death, Manuel trusted himself to the river. He glided off the
  shoal without making a ripple, and swam deep with guarded strokes. Fish
  sported before him; spiders and snakes grazed his cheeks; caymans floated by
  with knotty snout parting the current, and lines of bubbles bursting with
  hollow sound betrayed the underwater passage of more of the lazy
  reptiles.</p>

  <p>Once Manuel felt the swirl and heave of water disturbed by a powerful
  force. A soft river breeze wafted to him the smell of burning wood and the
  dull roar of distant rapids. He crossed the shimmering space between the
  shadows of shore. Looking backward, he descried a circle of black snouts
  lazily closing in upon him. He quickened his strokes. The twinkling lights
  disappeared. All before him was black. He felt slimy reeds touch his face,
  and, lowering his feet, found the bottom, and cautiously waded out. Then he
  crouched down to rest to gather all his wit and strength for the final
  move.</p>

  <p>Toward the bank he could not see his hand before his face; riverward there
  was a glancing sheen of water that made the gloom opaque. He began to crawl,
  feeling in the darkness for a canoe. Moving downstream, he worked out of the
  marshy sedge to ground worn smooth and hard. It was a landing place for
  canoes.</p>

  <p>He strained his eyes. All about him were shadowy, merging shades without
  shape. The low murmur of strange voices halted him; he was within hearing of
  the cannibals. Then in him awoke the stealth and savage spirit of a jaguar
  stalking prey. Gliding up the trail, he peeped over the bank. Fires flickered
  back in the blackness, lighting wan circles that were streaked and shadowed
  by moving, dark forms. With fateful eyes Manuel watched.</p>

  <p>Below him a slight splash drew his attention. He fancied it too thin, too
  hard and dead, to be made by water creature. Again it broke the silence,
  unnatural to his trained ear. It was the splash of a paddle. Soundless as the
  shadows about him, Manuel glided down to the edge of the river and lay flat,
  hugging the sand.</p>

  <p>A long, low canoe, black against the background of the river gloom, swept
  in to the landing gloom, swept in to the landing, grated on the sand, and
  spread gentle, lapping waves against the beach. A slender form, smooth and
  wild in outline, stepped out within a yard of Manuel.</p>

  <p>Like a specter Manuel loomed up, and his hands closed vise-tight around
  the neck of the cannibal. He lifted him clear of the ground, and there held
  him, wrestling, wriggling till fierce struggles ceased in spasmodic
  convulsions and these subsided in a slow, trembling stretch.</p>

  <p>When the body hung limp, Manuel laid it down, and looked up the dim trail
  leading to the camp of the Cashibos. Upon him was the spell to kill. He saw
  again the gaudy butterfly darts in Seqor's back; he heard again that strange,
  terrible cry of triumph. Over him surged Seqor's grand disdain of life.
  Almost he yielded to an irresistible impulse to make that the end.</p>

  <p>"If I had my machete&mdash;" he thought. Then he threw off the insidious
  thrall, and, stepping into the canoe, picked up the paddle and pushed out
  into the river. The twinkling lights vanished in the foliage. There was no
  sound of pursuit; the dreamy jungle hum remained unbroken. He paddled the
  light canoe swiftly with the current.</p>

  <p>The moon rose, whitening the river lane. A breeze bore the boom of the
  Palcazu in flood. Once upon that river of rapids, Manuel would scorn pursuit.
  Slackening current told him that backwater had swelled the estuary. Soon his
  ears filled with the rumbling of waters, and he turned out of the estuary
  into the sliding, moon-blanched Palcazu.</p>

  <p>As he dipped into the glistening channel of the first rapid, the canoe,
  quivering and vibrating, seemed to lurch into the air. Shock on shock kept
  the bow leaping. Manuel crouched low in the stern. It took all the strength
  of his brawny arms to keep the canoe straight. Whirling suck holes raced with
  him; frothy waves curled along the gunwales. One rapid led into another,
  until the Palcazu was a thundering succession of broken waters. It ran wild
  for freedom. In the plunging inclines, the silver-crested channels, the
  bulging billows, were the hurry and spirit of the river. The current,
  splitting on black-headed stones, hissed its hatred of restraint. Manuel
  guided the canoe from side to side, glancing along the gulfs, fringing the
  falls, always abreast of the widest passages.</p>

  <p>A haze crept over the moon and thickened to gray fog. Shadows shrouded the
  river, hanging lower and lower, descending to mingle with the spray. Manuel
  paddled on while the hours passed.</p>

  <p>The fog curtain lightened to the coming of dawn. Manuel evinced no
  surprise to find himself gazing upon the misty flood of the wide Pachitea. He
  had run the Palcazu in one night. Paddling ashore, he beached the canoe to
  bail out water he had shipped in that wild ride.</p>

  <p>All night he had felt a balancing of some kind of cargo in the bow. Upon
  investigating, he found the bottom of the bow covered with palm leaves. These
  he lifted to discover two naked little savages cowering on a mat of woven
  reeds.</p>

  <p>"Cashibos!" ejaculated Manuel. "Boy and girl. They were in the canoe last
  night when I strangled that fellow, their father, probably. What's to be done
  with them?"</p>

  <p>The boy was a dark copper color; his hair grew straight down over his low
  forehead; he was pot-bellied and altogether ugly. The girl was younger,
  lighter in color, slim and graceful, and pretty in a wild way, like a bronze
  elf of the jungle.</p>

  <p>"What'll I do with them?" repeated Manuel. "I can't kill them, or leave
  them here to starve or be eaten by jaguars. I'll take them down the Pachitea
  and turn them over to a Campas tribe."</p>

  <p>Having decided, Manuel folded a palm leaf and used it to bail out the
  canoe. In the bottom he found a bunch of dwarfish bananas and some dried
  fish. Here was good fortune in the way of food. He arranged the palm leaves
  across the gunwales, making a sun, rain, and dew shield. Then, pushing off,
  he paddled into the swollen current.</p>

  <p>The blazing sun rose; the sand flies wheeled with the drifting canoe; the
  afternoon rain poured; night came, with its cloud of singing mosquitoes, its
  poison dews and fogs.</p>

  <p>That day passed, and another like it. Every hour the canoe drifted speedy
  as the current. The Cashibos children lost their fear of Manuel. The boy
  jabbered and played; the girl smiled at Manuel, which persuaded him not to
  give them to a Campas tribe, but to take them home and care for them
  himself.</p>

  <p>Three more days and nights the canoe drifted. Manuel's strength had
  returned, but it troubled him to think. Something had happened up the river.
  He had for his pillow a ragged coat that fascinated him, and which he
  treasured.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning he turned the green bend at La Boca to come
  abruptly upon the Amazonas, lying at the dock. Men shouted from her decks;
  there was a thudding of bare feet.</p>

  <p>"Look! Look!"</p>

  <p>"Is it the outlaw?''</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Those shoulders and arms&mdash;it's he!"</p>

  <p>Manuel's blotched face, swollen out of all proportions, was
  unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>Captain Valdez leaned hard over the rail. "Manuel, is it you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, captain."</p>

  <p>"Where's your cowcha?"</p>

  <p>"Lost, captain, lost! A great rubber forest, captain&mdash;I had tons of
  cowcha&mdash;it's lost&mdash;all lost!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," replied Valdez ironically. "That's a fine cargo to pay
  you&mdash;two half-grown Indian kids. The nerve of you, Manuel, dropping into
  La Boca with slaves."</p>

  <p>"Slaves!" echoed from Manuel. His gaze traveled from Valdez's face to the
  little bronze Cashibos, once more huddling, frightened, in the bow. "Slaves?
  Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Manuel, you had your choice," went on the captain, "and now you must
  abide by it. I've caught some of you slave hunters this trip. There's Bustos
  in irons. Your choice Manuel&mdash;the chain gang, or the river?"</p>

  <p>"The river for me!" said Manuel. "Only up instead of down!"</p>

  <p>"Up! But, Manuel, there's a chance down the Amazon. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rubber hunter faced up the wide Pachitea. His stentorian cry froze the
  words upon Captain Valdez's lips. It rolled out, a strange, trenchant call to
  something beyond the wild, silent river.</p>

  <p>"Fever," whispered one of the fettered slave dealers.</p>

  <p>"Bitten crazy," said another.</p>

  <p>Manuel started the canoe upstream. He did not look back.</p>

  <p>Captain and crew and prisoners on the boat thrilled to Bustos's mocking
  farewell.</p>

  <p>"Adios, Manuel!"</p><br>
