  <p class="blurb">Into the night-shrouded swamp went Walter Parton, seeking
  the girl who long since had told him she was not fit to receive his love.
  Behind him sounded the shrill, devil-piping of that grinning god of hell,
  summoning his gold-horned beasts. And in his ears echoed the ghastly screams
  of Rose Loran from that hidden hut of evil where, people whispered, the marks
  of cloven hoofs had put Satan's signature.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; SWAMP TERROR</h2>

  <p class="first">OUT of the night a scream rose, high and thin and quivering.
  For a long minute it held, a scarlet thread of sound. Then it ended, and
  there was nothing but the rustle of breeze-stirred foliage and the shrill
  grating of the crickets, screeching an obbligato to terror.</p>

  <p>Rose Loran was icily motionless, staring across vague lamplight at the
  black oblong of the window through which the shriek had come. In her cold
  hands the dishes she had just removed from the cluttered supper table rattled
  tinily, shivering with the uncontrollable tremble of her slight frame. A
  precariously balanced tumbler jittered against the edge of the tray, toppled,
  smashed to the floor. The kitchen door behind the girl crashed open.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" Aunt Faith chattered. "Rose! Where&mdash;I thought
  you..."</p>

  <p>Rose twisted, the older woman's gibbering fright paradoxically restoring
  control over muscles momentarily paralyzed by the horror of that scream.
  Faith Loran, tall and spare, her drawn, thin face ash-colored and twitching,
  clung to the door-jamb. Her grey, tired eyes were wide-pupilled, staring, and
  her gaunt neck was corded with fear.</p>

  <p><i>"</i>I&mdash;I don't know." The words rasped Rose's parched throat.
  "Someone in the garden. Someone&mdash;it&mdash;it didn't sound like anything
  human."</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;the garden." The woman's pallid lips parted only slightly to
  let out the whispered syllables. "Elmer... I sent Elmer... to the well."</p>

  <p>"Oh Aunt Faith!" The exclamation was sharply rebuking. "In the dark! When
  you know he can hardly see in bright sunlight!"</p>

  <p>But there was relief in Rose's voice, too. Now she understood that scream.
  The decrepit old man who was their one servant had stumbled, fallen hard, and
  screamed. That was all it was. There was no reason for this fear that tore at
  her, that squeezed her pounding heart. Rose turned, snatched up the lamp from
  the table, started for the great arched opening at the other end of the
  high-ceilinged, huge dining hall.</p>

  <p>"Rose!" Aunt Faith's bony fingers clutched her biceps, digging in with
  convulsive strength. "Rose! Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Out to Elmer. He's hurt. I've got to..."</p>

  <p>"No!" It was a tenuous, almost voiceless gust of sound. "Don't go out
  there! Don't go out there&mdash;in the dark."</p>

  <p>"The dark!" Rose jerked away, exasperatedly. "I'm not a child. I'm not
  afraid of the dark."</p>

  <p>She was, though. She was eerily terrified by the moonless murk out there.
  Aunt Faith had made her afraid of it, in the past few weeks. The way her aunt
  had insisted on locking all the doors and windows at nightfall; the way she
  would stand for hours staring out into the sightless gloom&mdash;these things
  had their effect on the girl's nerves. She began to believe that her aunt
  expected to see something&mdash;dreadful...</p>

  <p>Only yesterday Rose had told Walter about Faith's queer behavior. Big
  shouldered, stalwart Walter Parton, the man who loved her and whom she loved.
  He had laughed, and then suddenly a tender fierceness had masked his
  broad-planed face. "Why don't you let me take you away from all this, Rose?" he had
  growled. "From this rotting house and this half-crazy aunt of yours."</p>

  <p>"I can't, Walter," the girl had sobbed. "Why do you keep coming back and
  asking me? You know I can't marry you. You know I can't marry anyone. I
  daren't."</p>

  <p>"I'll keep coming back, and I'll keep asking you till you say yes." How
  she had wanted to snuggle into those great arms of his, to feel his lips on
  hers! But she had pulled away and had told him to go, and he had climbed into
  his roadster and driven it away at reckless speed toward his home in
  Loranton. And she had gone slowly back to the shadows of Loran Hall and to
  the dread that had settled down upon it...</p>

  <p>The dim gleam of her lamp could not fill the vast expanse of the entrance
  foyer. It slid over the lower steps of a baronial staircase, along papered
  walls whose intricate patterns were faded and drab, stopped at the patinaed,
  dark oak of a towering door. Rose went to the portal, tugged at its heavy
  bolt.</p>

  <p>Aunt Faith was alongside her, was plucking fearfully at her sleeve. "Don't
  open it. For God's sake don't open it."</p>

  <p>The girl thrust her shoulder against the aged spinstress, shoved her away.
  "Please, Aunt Faith. You're hysterical. Elmer..." The bolt came out of its
  socket, and the heavy door creaked slowly inward to her pull. The lamp-flame
  flickered, sent a filament of black smoke curling upward, then burned
  steadily in the lifeless air. A rotted board in the floor of the broad porch
  sagged under Rose's slight weight. The roof-high pilasters fronting the house
  were a row of pallid, gigantic spectres marching away on either side into
  obscurity. A peculiar, hushed oppression closed in on her, and the pungent
  aroma of lush greenery was in her nostrils, tainted with the miasmic breath
  of Gorham's Swamp that held the Loran Estate within the crescent sweep of its
  putrescent bog.</p>

  <p>Rose hesitated, listening tautly. The night walled in the sphere of her
  feeble light, and reptilian tendrils of uncared for vegetation crawled over
  the verandah edge. A sound bubbled up through the sibilant sea of rural
  silence, a burbling, liquid moan. The girl's head jerked to it and it came
  again.</p>

  <p>"Elmer! Where are you, Elmer?" Thick-clustered, rank foliage took her cry,
  swallowed it. Brambles tore at her dress as she ran down the thudding path,
  rosebush thorns sliced the skin of her bare arms. Rose stopped suddenly, her
  heart pounding.</p>

  <p>Ahead something entered the rim of light, something that was moving.
  Something that writhed, agonizingly, and then was still.</p>

  <p>"Elmer!" Rose could only whisper the name as dread clutched at her larynx.
  She drove herself a hesitant step forward&mdash;and then her feet went out
  from under her, sliding in the slippery mud. She rolled, got to her
  knees.</p>

  <p>The lamp, jarred from her hand, had miraculously landed upright in the
  muck. Its light painted Elmer Stone's wrinkled face, twisted and almost
  unrecognizable. His face was drawn into lines of agony. His chest was a
  weltering horror of ripped overall cloth purplish with viscid, glutinous
  blood that spilled out of a deep and horrible gash torn raggedly through his
  breast. The memory of a bull-gored farmer she had seen once, years ago, came
  to Rose's fainting mind. This jagged wound was like that. But there was no
  bull inside the high iron fence Faith had insisted on erecting around the
  place, and whose tall gate she made a ceremonial of locking at dusk. There
  was no animal of any kind... What then, could have done this?</p>

  <p>A bubbling moan pulled her staring gaze back to the tortured countenance.
  Elmer's eyelids were blue, ghastly membranes drawn tight over the bulging
  round of his old eyes. His seamed skin was wax-pale with the filming of
  death. But his blue lips twisted and words came bubbling out.</p>

  <p>Rose bent closer, shuddering. Meaningless sounds came out of writhing
  agony. "Goat goatem..." Meaningless sounds that suddenly were drowned by a
  spew of blood. The racked body arced with a spasm of uttermost anguish, flung
  over in its final, terrible convulsion. A lax arm flopped down in the mud and
  lay still. Elmer Stone didn't move any more. Rose knew that he would never
  move again.</p>

  <p>"The goat&mdash;the goat man," a wire-edged voice screamed over Rose's
  head and splintered into high-pitched laughter, into a cacchination utterly
  mad. <i>"The piper has come for his pay."</i></p>

  <p>The girl surged to her feet, swung about to face her aunt. Faith Loran's
  head was thrown back. The crazed laugh shrieked from her wide-open, contorted
  mouth. One thin, satin-sleeved arm was thrust stiffly out in front of her and
  a bony forefinger pointed rigidly&mdash;not at the shattered corpse but at
  something beyond. Rose whirled and saw a pallid, grotesque specter the
  lamplight just reached.</p>

  <p>Panic struck at Rose for a frantic, ghastly moment, and then she knew what
  it was at which the spinstress pointed. A statue of Pan the wood-god,
  haunched on shaggy goat legs, reed pipes at his saturninely grinning mouth.
  Curving horns jutted out of the touselled disorder of the carved hair.
  <i>Horns.</i> Good God! Was the stain darkening one of them only moss
  or...</p>

  <p>"The night&mdash;," Faith screeched between peals of crazed
  laughter&mdash;"The night of the Lorans... only us left to pay the piper. We
  who did not dance must pay him... The sins of the fathers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rose couldn't see the stone pedestal on which Pan squatted, but she knew
  what Aunt Faith meant. There was a rhyme graven into it, a lilting rhyme from
  over whose deep, angular letters a boyish Walter Parton had once scraped
  green slime so that they could read:</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">Dance ye mornyng, dance ye noon,<br>
  Dance ye sunlit hours away.<br>
  Length'nyng shadowes tell that soone<br>
  I will come to ask my paye.</p>

  <p>The old woman's screaming laugh tore at Rose's nerves. It was harder to
  bear than even the sight of the mutilated corpse at her feet.</p>

  <p>The Lorans had danced. God knew they had danced! Roy Loran the second had
  brought to the paradise the first Roy had carved out of wilderness, carousing
  young bloods and complaisant ladies from the distant city. Roy the third,
  Faith's father and Rose's grandsire, had added new and terrible vices to the
  orgies of Loran Hall. He had died raving, calling down curses on the fourth
  Roy, who had killed Rose's parents in a drunken, wild auto ride and
  disappeared into the unknown.</p>

  <p>"The bill is overdue and we must pay&mdash;" Pan seemed to be listening to
  Faith Loran's wild cries with his cocked head. He seemed amused, with cruel
  lines around his mouth belying his grin, with evil puckering his tiny eyes...
  Suddenly Rose felt that she was going as mad as Faith.</p>

  <p>"Stop it," she screamed. "Stop it." Her hand struck out and its palm
  slapped stingingly across her aunt's sere cheek. "Stop it."</p>

  <p>The shrill laugh cut off, something like reason returned to the woman's
  staring eyes. She touched the red blotch left on her cheek by the girl's
  blow. "What happened to him?" she said haltingly. "Oh, Rose. What could have
  done it?"</p>

  <p>The girl shuddered. "Gored," she whispered. "A bull..."</p>

  <p>Faith shook her head. "No bulls anywhere near. And the gate is locked.
  Look." She clawed at her breast, pulled out a black ribbon through the seam
  of her blouse. A twisted, archaic key hung at its end. "I locked it and the
  only key has been with me all the time."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;what then...?" Rose shuddered, made herself look down again at
  Elmer. At the ground around the tragic heap drenched by water spilled from
  the bucket he had been carrying, by water and by...</p>

  <p>She was staring, staring unbelieving at the trampled mire. At black mud
  trampled and churned by feet whose imprints were glaringly, starkly plain in
  the light of the lamp set down among them. At sharply defined indentations
  that were filling with a slow seep of red-tinted moisture.</p>

  <p>They were unmistakable. They were prints of cloven hooves. Of hooves too
  small to be a bull's or a cow's. They might have been made by goat
  feet....</p>

  <p>A liquid ripple of shrill melody skirled out of the darkness, clotting the
  girl's thoughts. It changed to laughter&mdash;a sound of shrill, mocking
  glee. Such weird laughter as Pan's pipes might make if Pan were laughing into
  them.</p>

  <p>Something darted across the light&mdash;a small stone smashing into the
  lamp. Its chimney crashed and darkness blotted out the scene.</p>

  <p>"The goat man," Faith screamed. "Oh God..."</p>

  <p>A vast, formless bulk surged out of the darkness! Rose whirled, leaped
  into a frantic, desperate run. She sped up the path on the wings of fear. She
  ran endlessly through dank blackness filled with the stinging whiplash of
  unpruned branches, with the tripping tangle of untended vines. A hoarse
  breath panted behind her, and the thud, thud of ponderous, pursuing feet.
  Always behind her, and closer, closer...</p>

  <p>The house loomed ahead, its facade vaguely luminous. Across its porch
  Faith's vague form flitted, wild arms flailing above her head. She vanished
  into the gaping black maw of the open portal, and suddenly the dark oblong
  was narrowing, narrowing...</p>

  <p>"Don't," Rose screamed. "Don't close it. Don't close the door on me!" Her
  frantic feet pounded on wood, the single shallow step to the verandah, and
  something twitched at her dress from behind. A savage, bestial howl roared in
  her ears. A chattering howl of triumph.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; LIVING NIGHTMARE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE feral roar goaded the frantic girl to a frenzied leap.
  It carried her across the porch and through a narrow opening left by the
  closing door. Metal, the rusted lockbolt, gashed her arm, but she squeezed
  through. She sprawled, breathless, and heard the dull thud of the shutting
  door, the rattle of its bolt, the sound of a heavy body against it. <i>A
  sound</i> <i>like rock pounding against the wood.</i> The house shook to the
  impact, but the great door held.</p>

  <p>"The window," Faith screamed. "The window in the dining hall. The
  shutter."</p>

  <p>Rose jerked around, staggered to her feet. She dived through blackness
  into the great room where they ate, flung herself across the floor to the
  open window. Her hand clawed for the handle of the iron shutter that had been
  put there for protection against Indian attack when the hall was built. She
  pulled at it, tugged it down. Feet pounded outside, and a face glared in at
  her. Small eyes glittered malevolently under a leathery low forehead. She
  glimpsed wide-nostrilled, swarthy features, a pointed, straggly beard, and
  then the clanging metal cut them off from her vision.</p>

  <p>Rose pushed the hooked fastening home, reeled, clutching the sill to keep
  from falling. She pulled great sobbing breaths into her tortured lungs, and
  fought nausea twisting her stomach, fought madness swirling within her skull.
  Mad! She must be mad! For she had thought horns had projected from the brow
  of that evil countenance. She had thought it the visage of Pan, come
  alive.</p>

  <p>Pan, alive and malevolent! It was her nightmare suddenly become real, the
  nightmare from which time and again had driven her into shrieking
  wakefulness, and left her trembling in her bed.</p>

  <p>When she had been a lonely little child in this great house with only
  those two for company&mdash;her granite-faced grandfather with the agonies of
  hell smouldering in his eyes, and her dour-visaged aunt&mdash;she had used to
  pretend the sculptured godlet was a rollicking playmate, her own
  'boy-friend.' When Walter Parton had come to play with her, there had been
  the three of them. Then had come her grandfather's last, terrible night, his
  shouted obscenities booming through the hollow emptiness of Loran Hall,
  booming through the locked door behind which she had cringed, shaken and
  terrified.</p>

  <p>After it was over, after the old man had shouted his last curse and his
  profane lips were forever sealed, Aunt Faith had come to the cowering,
  white-faced fifteen-year-old. Trembling, distressed, she had told the girl
  the wild history of her ancestors.</p>

  <p>The founder of the line had come here from the sea. He had purchased the
  good land from one Stannard Gorham for a song, leaving Gorham only the
  useless swamp. He had brought workmen from far away Providence to erect this
  mansion. When it was finished he had married a girl twenty years his junior.
  She had died giving birth to his son.</p>

  <p>As if in defiance of Fate the first Loran had lavished all the luxuries
  the time afforded on his heir. There had been money to buy them with, gold
  money and silver from some mysterious, apparently inexhaustible store. Coins
  of alien mintage, some green and worn, some brightly new. The men who had
  built Loran Hall settled on Roy Loran's land. Loranton became a thriving
  community. Stannard Gorham repented of his bargain, came demanding
  restitution. He crawled away, after a while, broken in body and mind by that
  which had been done to him.</p>

  <p>The inevitable had happened. Rose's great-grandfather had grown up a
  waster and a profligate. His son, the man whom Death had just claimed, had
  outdone him. And <i>his</i> oldest son had attained the apex of
  evil&mdash;and brought the house crashing down. The last that had been heard
  of the fourth Roy Loran, of Rose's Uncle Roy, was a report of his death in a
  speakeasy brawl on New York's Bowery. Grandfather had refused to claim the
  body.</p>

  <p>"He said Potter's Field was too good for him," Faith had finished. "And
  that is the way the Loran line ended. We are all that are left and the Loran
  heritage must die with us. Love and children are not for us."</p>

  <p>It had dawned on Rose why Faith had never married. "Oh," she had sobbed.
  "Let's go away from here. Let's go away from this awful place."</p>

  <p>"We can't," the woman had replied. "My poor darling, we can't. Grandfather
  has willed the Hall to us and what's left of the estate. But that is all
  there is. There isn't any money left. Those who went before us have danced,
  and we must pay the piper."</p>

  <p>It was then that Rose understood why Stannard Gorham had astonishingly
  appeared during the festivities of the second Roy's marriage and presented
  the statue of Pan as a peace-offering. A peace-offering! He had mockingly
  placed his threat and his curse on the very lawn of his enemy. It was his
  hand that had graven that verse:</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">Dance ye mornyng, dance ye noon,<br>
  Dance ye sunlit hours away.<br>
  Length'nyng shadowes tell that soone<br>
  I will come to ask my paye.</p>

  <p>And when she had at last sobbed herself to exhausted sleep the dream had
  first terrified her... The smell of goat-flesh in blackness... A leering,
  lustful face close above her own&mdash;a man-face that was also the bearded
  and horned visage of a goat... Calloused, irresistible hands gripping her
  shoulders, forcing her down. A hairy, repulsive hide pressed against her
  skin, flaying her with its shaggy roughness...</p>

  <p>The next day Rose, white-faced, her eyes downcast, a slime of evil seeming
  to her to foul her slender body, had sent Walter away. He had returned again
  and again through the three long years, and again and again she had dismissed
  him.</p>

  <p>Each time she had fled to her room, weeping, reviling the fate that denied
  love to her...</p>

  <p>A fumbling rasp along the edge of the shutter at which she stared seemed
  to scrape the raw edges of her throbbing nerves. The corrugated metal bent
  inward a bit. Rose glanced frantically around the room, searching for some
  weapon, for anything that might serve to put up a futile battle against the
  dread thing that sought entrance. There was nothing...</p>

  <p>Dull pound of ponderous footfalls pulled her gaze back to the window. They
  faded. Had the killer, the&mdash;goat man&mdash;given up? Was he baffled by
  the defences Aunt Faith's senile mania had erected against him? <i>Against
  him!</i> She had known, then, that he was coming! <i>How had she
  known?</i></p>

  <p>He was not gone! Rose whirled to the sound of his probing fingers at the
  chamber's other window. He was making a circuit of the house. He was
  searching for a way in...</p>

  <p>The archway to the foyer filled with light, and then Faith was standing in
  it. From somewhere she had drawn courage, and she was again prim, stiffly
  erect in lustrous black satin, a high-boned collar jabbing into the parchment
  dryness of her skin, grey hair pulled tightly back from a brow whose fine
  mesh of wrinkles it could not smooth. The lamp in her hand was rock-steady.
  But her eyes were veiled. Rose knew that the dull curtain hid fear. Fear that
  had been a brooding threat for days, that was now a livid reality.</p>

  <p>"Rose! Did...?"</p>

  <p>"No. I got the shutter down in time. Aunt Faith&mdash;we've got to get
  help. We can't stay here with&mdash;that&mdash;outside."</p>

  <p>"Help! How?" The thin line of her mouth twisted with what might have been
  a bitter smile. "We dare not go&mdash;out there. And the telephone was taken
  out last week. They wouldn't let us have a telephone without paying for it.
  Our credit isn't good any more."</p>

  <p>"Credit! But you had money. You sold the last of the silver..."</p>

  <p>"And bought food with it. Wasted it on food we'll never eat. He'll get
  in... Rose... he'll find a way to get in. We can't escape him."</p>

  <p>It wasn't so much what she said that sent chills shivering up Rose's
  spine; it was her tone, dull, flat, utterly hopeless. Pregnant with the same
  grim fatalism with which she had once said, "We must never marry. We must die
  friendless and alone."</p>

  <p>"He! What&mdash;who is he? Who is the man with the horned head?" The
  question was wrung from her. "You know, Aunt Faith. You have been expecting
  this."</p>

  <p>A muscle twitched in the sunken, age-yellowed cheek. "I? How should I
  know? The Lorans had many sins and many enemies. For each sin an enemy.
  Perhaps&mdash;a horned head! Have you forgotten your Shakespeare, child? Have
  you forgotten that horns on a man's forehead are the brand of a cuckold?"</p>

  <p>A cuckold&mdash;a betrayed husband. What was the story of Uncle Roy's last
  escapade before the one that had ruined him? Of the girl he had met in the
  swamp&mdash;the wife of Gant Gorham...?</p>

  <p>Gant Gorham! Elmer's gasping, unintelligible message came back. Gant
  Gorham! Was it that he had tried to say? Had he been accusing the descendant
  of Stoddard Gorham who lived in the morass that was his inheritance, alone
  and half-mad in some foul shack on an island of harder ground? Rose had never
  seen him, but...</p>

  <p>"Aunt Faith! I can get help. I can get Walter! The roof&mdash;it's copper!
  I'll build a fire up there. Walter will see it. He'll come..."</p>

  <p>"No. It isn't any use. The roof isn't high enough..."</p>

  <p>"It is. I've been up there and I could see his house over the trees
  between."</p>

  <p>Action, any action, was a relief from dread. Rose ran into the kitchen,
  snatched up an armful of firewood, matches. She was out in the foyer again,
  was running up the great staircase, through a passageway, up narrower steps.
  She wanted no light, every inch of the old house was familiar. Here was the
  ladder to the roof.</p>

  <p>She got the heavy trapdoor open. Wind beat in on her from the black pall
  of a cloud-filled sky. A storm wind. She dropped her kindling on the flat
  roof. Her shaking hands made a small tent of the firewood sticks. She fumbled
  in the little pocket of her frock for the matches.</p>

  <p>The rustle of breeze-tossed leaves came to her, and a curious pattering
  like the quick beat of raindrops. But it wasn't raining yet. Rose rose to her
  feet, ran toward the parapet overlooking the garden. Reached it and leaned
  over the crumbling rail. Jagged lightning split the clouds, and the tangled
  brush below was vivid with blue glare.</p>

  <p>Vivid and alive with movement. The pattering came from down there, the
  rapid scamper of many feet. Another lightning streamer showed. Rose knew what
  made it. Little animals, dozens of them, were running through the brush,
  running toward the house. Small black beasts. One of them was in the path.
  Rose gasped. It was a goat, an ebony skinned, bearded goat. But there was
  something grotesque about it. Something weirdly <i>wrong.</i></p>

  <p>Not in its shape or the manner of its pattering run. In its color. In the
  color of its horns and its hooves. They were not grey as a normal goat's
  should be. They were brightly golden. They were gilded... The beast vanished,
  and the beat of its weird feet came up from the porch.</p>

  <p>She must have been mistaken. Some freak of the fitful lightning had
  deluded her... There was another&mdash;a female. Its horns, too, gleamed,
  indescribably eerie.</p>

  <p>Rose's hands clenched on the rail, her fingers trembling. For a moment she
  could not move, could not think. The murdered man, the weird pursuing figure,
  had already made that garden a place of fear. But it was something other than
  that now. It was an enclosure visited by an ancient terror, invaded by beings
  that were goat-form and yet were not goats. Tag ends of shivery legends slid
  across her pulsing brain, traditions of whispered horror. They were under
  her, just under her, filling the broad verandah of Loran Hall, their hoofs
  making a small thunder on its rotting boards. A thunder nearer than the
  mutter of the approaching storm.</p>

  <p>Then there was another sound. All her life she had heard it, but in this
  moment it seared her with appalling dismay. The sound of creaking hinges came
  up to her&mdash;the creak of the great door's opening hinges. She could not
  be mistaken...</p>

  <p>And there were voices. Faith's harsh accents, and a bass rumble she could
  not recognize... But it could be only the voice of Elmer's murderer!</p>

  <p>Oh God! It had been Faith who had sent old Elmer out to his death! It had
  been Faith who but for her own frantic, incredible leap would have shut her
  out, helpless in the grip of the terror! It had been Faith who had pointed to
  the veiled prophecy on Pan's pedestal and laughed! Laughed in the presence of
  horrible death!</p>

  <p>Faith had known of the coming of the beast and had waited for it, not with
  fear but with impatience. Faith had argued against the signal Rose had come
  up here to set, calling for help. Faith was opening the door now to let in
  the beast before Wally could come!</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; MAN TRAP</h2>

  <p class="first">A MIST of red wrath wavered before Rose Loran's eyes. Faith
  Loran&mdash;Aunt Faith&mdash;had known of some awful vengeance descending on
  Loran Hall. To save herself she had offered Elmer as a sacrifice, and Rose.
  She was making that bargain now, down there, offering her niece, her ward, in
  exchange for her own safety. It was damnable.</p>

  <p>The girl's small fists clenched, she whirled away from the parapet,
  sobbing with choked anger. They would not get away with it. She went back to
  the hatchway. She knelt to the fire she had laid and thrust a flaming match
  into the shavings at its base. The tinder caught&mdash;</p>

  <p>A scream shrilled up from below, a high, quavering, scream exactly like
  Elmer's last cry from the darkness. But this was not followed by silence. It
  was quenched, rather, by a sudden blatting chorus of goat-cries, and by the
  skirling laughter of the Pan pipes.</p>

  <p>Rose forgot her anger. She spun about, remembering only that Aunt Faith
  had been a mother to her, that Aunt Faith needed her now. She caught up a
  thick bludgeon, hurled herself down the ladder and the stairs, hurtled along
  the dark second floor corridor, snatched at the newel-post of the main
  stairway to twist herself to that last broad flight. Then she stopped,
  peering down, trembling...</p>

  <p>Light flickering in through the open door showed her the foyer floor.
  Showed her the gilt-horned goats milling around something on that floor,
  something twisted, and bloody, and horrible.</p>

  <p>She saw the bronzed, naked back of a man crouched over the gory body of
  Aunt Faith. <i>If it was a man.</i> His hair was tight curled, shaggy. His
  haunches&mdash;what she could see of them&mdash;were black-furred, shaggy,
  bestial. His hands, spatulate, hairy, were busy with the body of the woman on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>"No!" shrieked Aunt Faith. "You won't get it out of me. It's done enough
  damage already." Her voice was edged with terror and agony.</p>

  <p>Rose's arm arced upward, swept down. The heavy stick flew down through the
  dark. She heard it crash into the creature's skull. Its thud sickened the
  girl, but the blow that would have dropped an ordinary man only brought a
  howl from the one below. He raised up, twisted about. In a new flash Rose saw
  the face staring up at her that had glared in through the window. The
  sharp-chinned, satyr's countenance. Were those horns on his brow or...?
  Before she could make sure darkness had smashed in again with a brain-shaking
  peal of awesome thunder.</p>

  <p>It seemed to come in the house and roll up the stairs beneath her. But it
  wasn't thunder, it was the pound of Pan's feet coming up to her. Rose
  whirled, leaped into a frenzied dash for safety. Where was there safety in
  this house invaded by terror? The roof? If she could get to the roof, fling
  herself over. Death, any death rather than...</p>

  <p>A hole in the frayed carpeting caught her heel, flung her down. She
  sprawled, despair exploding in her brain. She rolled... The smell of goat
  flesh gusted out of the blackness. Calloused, irresistible hands gripped her
  shoulders. A hairy, repulsive hide was against her quivering skin. Through
  the thin fabric of her frock it flayed her with its roughness...</p>

 <h3>*</h3>

  <p>A rolling peal of thunder died away. Lightning flashed in through the
  windows once more, and the electric lamp by which Walter Parton was trying to
  read dimmed, flared up again. He slammed his book down on the floor, unfolded
  his lank, loose-knit length, stood on heavy-thewed, spraddled legs. A frown
  creased his tanned forehead and in his brown eyes pain slept, pain that had
  not been long out of them through the years since Rose Loran had first told
  him she was not for him.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a storm coming up," he muttered in the habit of one who is much
  alone. "If lightning hits that old house..."</p>

  <p>Damn it. If Rose would only get over that foolish idea of hers. If she
  would only let him take care of her. From that window he could just see the
  roof of Loran Hall... About time he got over his kid habit of gazing at it
  for long hours, heartsick with love denied... He strode across the
  room...</p>

  <p>He was staring out into pitch blackness... What the hell! An orange spark
  splashed the night. It grew momentarily brighter, was unmistakably the
  flicker of a flame. <i>There was nothing over there but Rose's home!</i></p>

  <p>Parton whirled, threw himself down the stairs. He ran to the 'phone in the
  hall, frantically twirled its handle to call the firehouse in distant
  Loranton. There was no sound in the receiver slammed against his ear. No
  sound at all. Damnation! The rickety line was out again. Every time there was
  a storm it did that! Walter hurled the useless cylinder of hard rubber
  against the wall. He ran out of the house, leaped into the seat of his
  rattletrap roadster, breathing a prayer of thankfulness that he had been too
  lazy to garage it.</p>

  <p>The slam of the door, the whir of the starter, the clash of gears and the
  roar of a hard-pushed motor merged into one continuous sound. Headlights
  leaped out to snatch a rushing ribbon of rutted road out of the darkness.
  Malformed, grotesque trees flicked by. The world lit up with a quivering blue
  glare of lightning and vanished again with a detonation of deafening
  thunder.</p>

  <p>Underbrush scraped the flivver's sides. Boards of a narrow bridge rattled
  swiftly underneath. Parton's foot pounded down on the brake pedal as a great
  black gap in the bridge deck leaped into the glare of his headlights. The car
  squealed protest and the seat dropped away underneath Parton. Checked
  momentum slammed him forward. Windshield glass crashed. As weltering,
  nauseous blackness stabbed him with excruciating pain he thought he heard
  shrill laughter somewhere near&mdash;skirling laughter...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">FILTHY, lecherous fingers tore at Rose Parton's clothing. A
  scream of nightmare horror ripped her throat.</p>

  <p>"You devil," Faith shrieked from below. "Let her alone. I'll tell. I'll
  tell if you leave her."</p>

  <p>Through retching oblivion that swept in on her Rose was vaguely conscious
  that the hands were no longer tearing at her. She crawled&mdash;tried to
  crawl. She was going down, down into nothingness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">PARTON battled with unconsciousness, fought it off. Dazedly
  he pulled himself out from under the twisted steering wheel. Throbbing pain
  streaked across his cheek and the taste of his own blood was salty on his
  lips. An electric flicker showed him the grotesquely slanted hood of his car,
  the crumpled radiator crushed against a heavy board at the other side of the
  gap in the bridge. Painfully he got out on the running board, crept along it,
  dragged himself over the hood's hot metal. He was on firm ground again. He
  was running, running madly along a road lit only fitfully by sky-rending
  flashes.</p>

  <p>And with him ran dread. For he had seen, as he struggled to get across the
  opening his wrecked flivver bridged, fresh scars of wood that could have been
  made only by an ax. That gap was not an accident of rotted timbers fallen in.
  It was man-made, made by someone who purposely had intended to block the road
  to Loran Hall.</p>

  <p>Gasping, he reached the high iron fence around the Loran Estate. The
  turretted silhouette of the ancient mansion bulked against the blacker dark
  of the sky, and tiny flames flickered on its roof. Even as he clung, shaken
  and distrait, to the locked gate they were gone. Queer, he thought dully. The
  fire had put itself out.</p>

  <p>And then he remembered that that roof was of copper, was impervious to
  flame. Remembered Rose's troubled recounting of her aunt's unaccountable
  fear, and the strange circumstance of the wrecked bridge. Good Lord! That
  fire had been a signal, a desperate call for help. The danger, whatever
  danger Faith Loran had feared, had descended upon Loran Hall! Rose needed
  him&mdash;and the fence, the locked gate, barred him out.</p>

  <p>"Rose!" he shouted. "Rose! I'm coming. Hold on! I'm coming." He backed
  away, crouched. His leg-muscles uncoiled like unleashed springs, hurtled him
  at the barrier. His hands gripped the spikes at the top. They pierced him
  with new tortures. He held on, his biceps cracked, swelling, but his lifted
  foot groped for and found the top-rail of the fence. He was over.</p>

  <p>He ran through the tangle of the un-kept garden. A pale wraith looming
  above him was the statue of Pan for which Rose had taken an inexplicable
  dislike, right after her grandfather died. That had been part of the queer
  change in her that had caused him so much distress. He passed it, skidded in
  mud. Fell and his hand clutched into clammy flesh. He rolled away,
  shuddering. A lightning flash showed him horror!</p>

  <p>He was on his feet again, reached the porch, and dashed through the door.
  The <i>open</i> door. Good Lord! What had happened here! What fiendish
  thing?</p>

  <p>Walter Parton's mouth set into a grim line across his pallid face, as he
  paused, tensely listening. The musty dead smell of the ancient house was all
  about him. Eerie, fitful flashes of light from the lightning of the nearing
  storm was the only illumination in the shrouded, funereal entrance hall.</p>

  <p>"Rose!" he shouted frantically.</p>

  <p>Walter listened to the echoing diminuendo with which the mansion mocked
  him. There was no answer, but he sensed some presence here that was dread
  made tangible, that waited for his burning, wide-pupilled eyes to find it in
  the gloom. His sleeves tightened over bulging biceps, his fists knotted as if
  to meet an attack. And then he saw it, far back in the vague foyer; a dark
  mound, a motionless dark pile. He moved, stiff-legged and tensed, across the
  uncarpeted floor; fearing to scan the limp heap closer yet knowing that he
  must do so. His cold hand fumbled in a pocket, came out with a wood match as
  he got to the dark form. His thumb rasped across the match-head, and a little
  flame spurted from the splinter. Its light spilled down.</p>

  <p>Pent breath popped from between Walter's icy lips in a choked gasp, and
  the match dropped from his nerveless fingers&mdash;dropped hissing into
  viscid liquid still oozing redly from the corpse.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; CLUTCH OF THE SWAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">HORROR quivered in deepening darkness, in silence thick with
  dread. In Walter's temples a pulse pounded against the steel band of terror
  that constricted his forehead, and his hand seemed mittened, clumsy as he
  groped for another match.</p>

  <p>Dancing, minute light forced the lurking shadows back a little way.
  Queerly, even in the brutal death that had come to her, even with her skull
  crushed in and her thin frame contorted in final agony, something of the
  rigid austerity of her spinsterhood still clung to Faith Loran. But on the
  pallid fabric under the woman's scrawny neck, on the yellow of her skin, on
  the scrubbed whiteness of the wooden floor all about her, tiny footprints
  showed, the twin small ovals of goats' cloven hoofs stamped in thin blood!
  Parton caught the taint of their odor in the quivering, stifling air he
  pulled into his lungs. Goats! What mocking, derisive thing was this? What
  outer horror had invaded this old house? What incredible thing was it that
  had slain old Elmer and Faith? <i>Where was Rose?</i></p>

  <p>He shouted her name, sprang toward the stairs. His feet pounded up the
  great staircase, resounded through the ominous, shadowy reaches above.
  <i>"Rose!"</i> His shouted, frantic call echoed through emptiness. He dashed
  back to the entrance-hall again, staggering, grey despair masking his working
  face, cold sweat dripping from it. Rose was gone, was somewhere in the hands
  of the vicious killer. Rose was gone...</p>

  <p>Lightning framed the doorway in blue glare, vanished. It seemed to the
  frantic man that the inimical, haunched statue of Pan had been silhouetted
  right there in the opening. So real the impression was that he crouched to
  meet it. A foul, animal-like odor engulfed him, and a hard fist crashed
  against his shoulder. With appalling suddenness Parton was involved in a
  maelstrom of fierce combat, was fighting for his life with an eerily huge
  antagonist who had about him some macabre weirdness that made Walter's blood
  run cold within him even as he fought.</p>

  <p>The smash of hairy fists, impacting on his bones as though the cushion of
  his flesh and muscle had been stripped away, pounded excruciating agony
  through him. Walter sidestepped, got home with his own fist, might veritably
  have been battling the stone monument for all the effect it had. His
  adversary was gigantic, seemed possessed of supernormal strength and gave
  vent to grunting, animal sounds that tightened its unearthly,
  terror-inspiring quality. Parton rained futile blows on the monstrous thing that
  sought his destruction. Skinned knuckles were the reward of his efforts, and
  pain that shot up his arms, paralyzed his muscles.</p>

  <p>The thing that had come out of the night closed in; relentless,
  implacable. Parton felt shaggy arms wrap around his weakening body, and he
  was hugged tight to a steel-hard torso. The hands that clamped him
  constricted, drove the breath from his chest. He felt his ribs caving in, his
  tortured spine cracking. His eyes bulged, he tasted the salt of blood on his
  lips...</p>

  <p>The world exploded in a tremendous blast that swallowed Loran Hall in a
  coruscation of electricity gone mad! Flame spurted&mdash;was it in his own
  head? Walter carommed into a corner, slammed against a papered wall. He slid
  to the floor. He knew that the gargoylesque shape whose attack had so nearly
  destroyed him had rushed to the back of the house, had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Acrid smoke stung his nostrils.</p>

  <p>Afterwards Walter wondered that he was able to force himself to his feet,
  to reel after his late antagonist. It was the thought of Rose that spurred
  him past the stairs, through the wavering flames of the fire the
  lightning-flash had set&mdash;the thought that this being would lead him to
  Rose.</p>

  <p>A blank wall confronted Parton, but to his right there was a door. He
  whirled to it, flung it open. Lurid firelight flared in, lit up wooden,
  descending steps. Walter threw himself down those steps, saw a stone-vaulted
  basement receding into shadow, heard a grating noise and the faint echo of a
  taunting laugh.</p>

  <p>Fire-glare set his long shadow dancing on tamped-down earth that showed no
  trace of any passing. Lightning flicked through a high-up small window,
  revealed the cellar from end to end, from side to side. It was starkly empty.
  Cobwebs hung undisturbed from beamed rafters, the dust of years was clotted
  on grimly grey foundation stones that were its walls.</p>

  <p>A racking cough seized Walter, doubled him up with its paroxysm. His eyes
  were streaming, misted. He was aware that smoke was pouring down the stairs
  behind him, heard the crackle of flames. He twisted about, saw red firelight
  darting ominously through a billowing smoke-cloud. He was caught by the fire,
  caught down here to be cremated in a raging furnace, to end with the end of
  Loran Hall...</p>

  <p>Heat beat on Walter Parton's back like the breath of a Moloch. Flames
  hissed, then roared hungrily as old wood caught and blazed. Jagged fingers,
  yellow and orange and oddly green, reached for him out of the rolling murk,
  snatched at him hungrily. Impossible to return up those fiery
  stairs&mdash;and there was no other way out of this basement. He was cut off,
  doomed!</p>

  <p>Parton groaned, dropped, crawled along the earthen cellar-floor on hands
  and knees, his head low to seek what little clearer air there was down here.
  Strength seeped from him. He couldn't breathe. Suffocation would claim him in
  minutes now. At least he would be unconscious when the raging flames reached
  him.</p>

  <p>His head struck stone, rough stone of the farther wall. Walter lay still,
  gasping, despair a leaden weight at his stomach-pit.</p>

  <p>The smoke lifted over him, seemed to be drawn upward so as to give him a
  slightly greater space of comparatively clean air to breathe. It was being
  drawn upward! He could see the curl of the tendrils, their ascending current,
  remembered the high-placed window. Luck, or some guiding Providence, had
  brought him just beneath it. But that window was ten feet above him, beyond
  his reach and, perhaps, too small to permit his passage.</p>

  <p>Parton filled his lungs, scrambled to his feet. His clawing fingers found
  chinks in the masonry, his toes scraped, caught in tiny interstices. He
  climbed painfully up the rough wall. His hand found the window-sill,
  agonizing effort got his knees onto the narrow ledge.</p>

  <p>A chink between sash and frame gave him time for another breath, but it
  was smoke-tainted, cut his chest with its knife-edge stab. A cough tore at
  his throat. He fought it, fearful that it might jar him from his frail hold.
  He felt grimy glass, smashed it, felt the shards cut his fists but did not
  feel the pain.</p>

  <p>The opening pulled smoke, heat, over and around him. Walter shoved his
  head through, but his shoulders caught. He squirmed. Jagged glass ripped his
  shirt, his flesh. The taper of his frame to the waist made passage easier
  when his shoulders were through and he was out, was sprawling in dry grass.
  The fire roared like a disappointed demon, and almost continuous thunder
  answered it.</p>

  <p>Parton staggered erect. The weed-grown grounds were luminous with the blue
  flicker of lightning and the red glare of the blazing house. He sought the
  statue of Pan. It was in its accustomed place. But it seemed to have turned
  on its pedestal to face him, and its grin to have become a smirk of evil,
  leering triumph.</p>

  <p>The heavens burst into electric flame. Cataclysmic sound shook the earth.
  Beyond Pan a dark figure moved, raised itself over the fence, vanished into
  the encroaching woods. How had he gotten out of the basement and across the
  grounds? Parton shuddered. There was something ungodly about the distorted
  creature.</p>

  <p>The iron fence was too high for him to climb in his weakness. Memory came
  to his aid, he found a depression that had served him long ago, wriggled
  under the barrier.</p>

  <p>Thick-knit leaf-ceiling overhead quenched lightning-flicker; intervening
  trunks blocked the glare of the fire and impenetrable gloom swallowed him.
  But there was the threshing of a heavy body ahead for him to follow, the dull
  thudding of footfalls unnaturally ponderous.</p>

  <p>The footing grew soft. Moisture-drenched soil sucked at Parton's heels. He
  was, he realized, on the edge of Gorham's Swamp. That was where the thing
  ahead of him was going. The lay of land here, the playground of his boyhood,
  was familiar to him as the palm of his hand. The guiding sounds had vanished
  but he didn't need them any longer. There was only one way into the morass.
  Foot-wide, masked by cattails and rushes, a single causeway of solid earth
  meandered across the bog, widening to make the island where Gant Gorham's
  shanty stood.</p>

  <p><i>Gant Gorham!</i> Enlightenment burst on Parton. Gant Gorham, implacable
  enemy of the Lorans, was behind this, although the monstrous shape that had
  lurched in through the Hall's doorway at him was not that of the
  swamp-dweller.</p>

  <p>Furtive sounds behind him, a strange sensation of inimical eyes watching,
  prickled the nape of his neck with fear. Parton whirled. Nothing was there.
  Nothing but the silent, gloom-shrouded forest, the distorted bulks of
  malformed trees.</p>

  <p>Overcast, black sky came again into view as the woods thinned at the bleak
  edge of the swamp. Here was the cairn of stones that he had helped to erect
  as a boy, to mark the entrance of the natural causeway. It lay ahead,
  tortuous, but his feet remembered every twisted curve of it.</p>

  <p>Walter was tight-faced as he set out on the dangerous passage, his eyelids
  narrowed to thread-like slits, muscle-ridges lumping along his blunt jaw.
  Rose was on that island just ahead, and the swart-visaged killer who had
  stolen her for some mad purpose of a twisted mind. Gorham was there... Walter
  swore between white lips that neither Gorham nor the devil himself could
  stand between him and the girl he loved.</p>

  <p>The swamp was not silent, things slithered through it&mdash;ominous things
  of slime and scum. A bubble plopped in thick mud, and a small creature
  shrieked as quicksand caught it. Walter was in the center of the morass,
  moving cautiously despite his haste, drawing on memory for the path he must
  tread to avoid foul death waiting on either side.</p>

  <p>The shrilly liquid skirling of pipes laughed behind him, changed quickly
  to goat-call. Wally started to run, twisted back as the quick patter of tiny
  hooves came to him from the island ahead. Black against black, a small form
  rushed out on the causeway. Another. Lightning lit up the world and Parton
  saw that the narrow path was alive with black-skinned goats, with a shoving,
  pell-mell rush of ruminants whose hooves and horns were gilded. The weird
  sight struck a sudden, queasy terror into Parton, filled him with a sense
  that powers other than human were battling against him for the body and the
  soul of the girl he loved.</p>

  <p>The pipes called again, blurring, shrieking with a queer madness. Maddened
  bleating answered. The grotesquely ornamented goats, crazed by the Hamelin
  piping, stampeded toward him. They piled up, shoving one another from the
  causeway, screaming with almost human agony as the black mud and the
  quicksand caught them, screaming till their shrieks blubbed into silence.</p>

  <p>Ten, a dozen of the onrushing small animals were thrust to muddy death,
  but the others came on as the skirling of the Pan-pipes crescendoed. They
  came on, an irresistible avalanche of gilt-horned destruction that must
  surely throw him from the path, into the slow, strangling death of the
  quicksand.</p>

  <p>He could not stop them, no power on earth could stop them. Man or devil he
  would have fought on that precarious footing, would have fought and flung
  into the quaking bog, but these horned creatures, these miniature
  incarnations of a world gone insane, he was powerless against.</p>

  <p>He turned to run, to give them passage and return after they had
  passed&mdash;and recoiled as a gargoylesque dark mass hurtled toward him from
  the swamp-edge whence he had just come. The thing that had attacked him in
  the old house was plunging along the path. Its grotesque, gigantic goat-shape
  was more noisome than the swamp; its shaggy arms flailing against the
  tempest-lit sky were like fungus-coated limbs of a dead tree come to unholy
  life.</p>

  <p>Walter's lips grimaced in a snarl of hate, and he lunged to meet the weird
  attack. But the momentary halt was fatal. Horns, a hard head, catapulted into
  him from behind, battered him from the causeway. He arced through muggy air,
  sprawled into black mud that geysered as his frame splashed into it. Mud
  slapped across his face, blinded him, thrust its stinking mush into his
  nostrils, his mouth, his ears. Instinct pulled his head up and back, out of
  the half-liquid slime. Instinct betrayed him as the movement drove his legs
  down and the sliding, granular mass of quicksand clamped his feet and ankles.
  He was trapped, caught in the quicksand, and terror tore at his throat.</p>

  <p>Above him Pan-pipes laughed gloatingly. The woods, cowering beneath the
  impending onslaught of the gale, caught up the laughter and tossed it from
  contorted bole to writhing limb. Slime-born things slithered close around
  him, and clammy coldness whipped across his hand.</p>

  <p>The pipes laughed again, their laughter trilled into goat cry. The hairy
  little things that had encompassed his destruction&mdash;those that
  remained&mdash;wheeled and scampered back to the island, vanished. More
  slowly the piper lurched after them.</p>

  <p>Between Walter and the island an enmeshed goat screamed in agony. Its
  scream was poignant, human. Again the quivering sound came. But this time it
  was not a goat that screamed. It was a woman. It was Rose!</p>

  <p>Rose was screaming in terror as the goat-man followed his creatures into
  islets mystery, and Parton only yards away, could not help her. The quicksand
  ran away from beneath his feet like the slow, inevitable ebbing of grains in
  an hourglass measuring the short space of life left to him. Surface slime
  already chilled his calves, lapped slowly higher.</p>

  <p>Rose's scream stopped short, as if a hairy palm had thudded across her
  mouth. And the Pan-pipes laughed on the island, trilled obscene glee as
  jelled mud quivered slowly upward to the trapped man's slim waist.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE END OF THE LORANS</h2>

  <p class="first">JAGGED blue split the universe from horizon to horizon, and
  the riven cosmos crashed together again with devastating sound.</p>

  <p>The encompassing cloud opened and belched its contents. The air was
  suddenly solid with the cataract, the earth flattened by the downpour.
  Walter's world was the inexorable clutch of mud and sand about his legs, his
  waist, his abdomen. His body throbbed with pain and despair.</p>

  <p>If only, he thought, that lightning had struck the island and killed Rose,
  he could die content. Perhaps it had&mdash;God grant that it had.</p>

  <p>Water swirled about his chest and his neck, boiled over his tight lips;
  water lashed to foam by more water that descended in flooding torrents.</p>

  <p>In seconds now it would be over his nostrils, and that would be the end.
  Rose...</p>

  <p>The slow creep of the quicksand was halted. The lift of the two-foot layer
  of new water covering the swamp was sufficient to balance its sucking.</p>

  <p>But that water would drown him. It was a cleaner death, but death
  nevertheless. Why not duck his head the inch it would take to meet that
  death?</p>

  <p>Something bumped against him. His finger clutched shaggy hair, horns
  scraped his side.</p>

  <p>It was a goat, and the creature was moving, moving strongly. The water
  that had been sufficient only to keep Parton from sinking had pulled the
  animal's slim legs free of the mud, and the goat was half-swimming,
  half-running parallel to the causeway.</p>

  <p>Walter reached for the ruminant's horns. The goat's forelegs found firmer
  ground almost at once. It bleated, surged strongly ahead. That surge was just
  sufficient to pull Walter free of the mire, to drag him, too, to where he
  could find firm enough foothold for the final effort that released him from
  the bog's lethal grip. Ahead of him was a rain-lashed clearing; but from
  somewhere came a faint glimmer, and Walter Parton could see the herd of goats
  huddled against unpainted boards of Gorham's shack. Above them a thin
  right-angle of yellow light came from within, otherwise cut off by some
  covering that blanketed the window.</p>

  <p>Parton knew he must get to that window, must peer through it. But the
  goats were right there, their scattering would betray his presence. Already
  they were restless, bleating.</p>

  <p>A door creaked open on the other side of the shack. Small heads tossed, a
  billy blatted. The herd wheeled, crashed into the woods.</p>

  <p>Parton lay close to the muddy, stinking ground waiting for discovery. But
  the hidden door shut again, and no threatening form loomed around the corner
  of the decrepit hut. Parton squirmed to it, raised himself to the window.</p>

  <p>The slit that was the only aperture for his spying was threadlike, and a
  little way from it, within, something blocked Walter's vision.</p>

  <p>He moved a bit, brought into sight a recumbent head, an unshaven, brutal
  mustached countenance beneath whose leathery skin death-pallor showed.
  Wally's forehead knitted. This was Gorham, Gant Gorham. But the man was
  unconscious or dead. Who then...?</p>

  <p>Someone moaned within, moaned with hopeless pain. Walter's scalp
  tightened. That whimper of agony came from Rose's throat, or he had never
  heard her voice. His decision was made in an instant. He turned about to get
  to the door of the shack... Something crashed against the back of his neck,
  against his head, and oblivion swept over his senses.</p>

 <h3>*</h3>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know," Rose was screaming. "I don't know and I can't
  tell you."</p>

  <p>Her agonized voice pulled Walter out of the pain and the darkness in which
  he weltered, pulled him up to the throbbing torture of torn body, and nerves.
  His eyes opened...</p>

  <p>Gant Gorham lay motionless on a pallet of rags just under the window that
  was blinded by a tattered quilt. Lamplight flickered across his face, giving
  it a semblance of life, but the black hilt of a knife protruded from his
  bloody chest. A twisted man-creature crouched, blocking Wally's further view.
  It moved...</p>

  <p>Rose hung against the wall, her wrists bound by rope to rusted spikes
  driven deep into the wood, her arms straight lines of tensed anguish. Her
  chestnut hair framed a face that was strained and lined with suffering. Her
  body writhed&mdash;its clean sun-browned curves naked except for a lacy wisp
  pendent between waist and thighs. Muscles across her drawn-in abdomen pulsed,
  and the strained lines of her arms were repeated in the terrific straining of
  her legs as her toetips touched the grimy floor.</p>

  <p>Parton pulled silently at ropes that were tight around his ankles, that
  bound his arms to his flanks. His efforts were futile. An expert hand had
  knotted them, the hair-covered, long-nailed hand hanging now beside a shaggy,
  curiously formed haunch. That hand opened and closed as Parton watched it.
  Every line of its grotesque owner betrayed evil malevolence incarnate.</p>

  <p>The rasping, hoarse voice that answered the girl's defiance was as
  animal-like, as weirdly bestial as his macabre form. "You know, damn you. You know
  where Faith hid the Loran treasure. She opened the door to beg me to go away
  and then she fooled me, the devil take her rotten soul. There wasn't anything
  under the Pan statue. If I hadn't killed her I would have made her tell what
  she did with it; but I'll get it out of you if I have to strip every inch of
  skin from your cursed body." His other arm jerked into Walter's vision,
  swishing. It was a whip that swished, a thick whip of corded snake-skin. The
  cruel lash whistled, cracked across the girl's taut abdomen. A livid weal
  oozed blood...</p>

  <p>Walter rolled, thumped against the hairy legs of the torturer. The monster
  staggered. Parton managed to squirm his legs about those hairy ones and the
  gigantic form collapsed upon him. It jolted over. Thick, hard thumbs closed
  on the bound man's throat, dug in. Walter's breath was cut off. His eyes were
  bulging. Darkness, the darkness of death, swirled about him...</p>

  <p>"Don't Uncle Roy," Rose screamed. "Don't."</p>

  <p>Her own fierce pains were forgotten as she stared at the terrible thing on
  the floor, as she saw Walter's tortured face turn purple, then blacken... And
  then new horror swamped her as the dead man on the pallet moved. Incredibly
  he was rising from the cot...</p>

  <p>The corpse's grimy hand jerked up with a horrible, mechanical motion,
  closed on the knife-handle jutting from his chest. A spurt of clotted blood
  followed the blade as he pulled it out. The dagger arced through the air,
  plunged into the back of the murderer. Gorham collapsed on top of the man he
  had come back from death to kill, and Walter was drowned in the spate of
  scarlet blood gushing over him from both writhing forms.</p>

  <p>The storm was over, and a pallid moon looked down on two half-naked
  figures, a man's and a girl's, that staggered out of the woods cloaking
  Gorham's Swamp. "Gorham wasn't dead, then," Walter muttered. "The knife kept
  the wound it had made closed, and he wasn't dead."</p>

  <p>"He was probably conscious for a long time, waiting for the chance you
  gave him. Oh, Walter, you were so brave..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that... Here, we can crawl under the fence right here... You
  called that&mdash;that <i>thing</i> Uncle Roy."</p>

  <p>"He was Uncle Roy, the man we all thought dead. Do you remember in the
  newspaper account of the fight in which he was supposed to have been killed
  it spoke of another one who was badly wounded and taken to the hospital
  unconscious?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That was Roy Loran. He told me all about it while he carried me through
  the swamp after he heard you shouting out by the gate. But he might as well
  have been dead, for years. One bullet chipped his skull, depressed a bit of
  bone that pressed into his brain and wiped out his memory. He was sent to an
  institution, escaped, and found work somewhere not far from here as a
  goat-herd.</p>

  <p>"Then he had another accident, and he recalled who he was. He wrote to
  Aunt Faith, about a month ago, telling her all this and demanding a great
  deal of money to remain unknown. She replied to tell him there was no money
  and he answered that he knew the first Loran had a fortune hidden somewhere
  on the ground, that he was coming to wring the secret out of her lying
  throat.</p>

  <p>"She didn't tell me a word of this, hoping he was bluffing, but he did
  come. What he suspected was true enough. Faith knew of the hiding place, in a
  tunnel from the basement of the Hall to an exit under the Pan statue..."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Wally interrupted. "That was why he ran when the lightning
  struck. He was afraid the fire would block him from it."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Faith told him the secret to save me from him. Then he heard your
  shout and carried me off to the hut in the swamp. Gorham came in, went for
  him, and he stabbed him...</p>

  <p>"He went out again, probably to look in the tunnel for the treasure. The
  blatting of the goats drove me mad..."</p>

  <p>"The goats! What on earth..."</p>

  <p>"I imagine his darkened mind must have retained some memory of the Pan
  statue. He had painted their horns and their hooves and trained them to
  answer his piping. When he returned he brought his herd along."</p>

  <p>Wally shuddered, held Rose close to him. "Somehow they were the worst of
  the whole business. There was something incredibly evil about them."</p>

  <p>"Terribly! They were like little imps from hell itself... I was frantic,
  bound there, alone, not knowing what to expect. And then, when the storm
  broke, he burst in, frothing at the mouth and raving that Faith and I had
  robbed the cache and hidden the treasure somewhere else. He hung me up as I
  was when you found me, swearing that he would torture me till I told him
  where it was. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about it any more sweetheart. It's all done for, finished. The
  Lorans are finished&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rose smiled demurely. "You forget, Wally, that I am a Loran."</p>

  <p>"We'll change that as soon as we get to the Reverend Wilkin's house,"
  Walter grinned. "Rose Parton is a much better name."</p>

  <p>Loran Hall was a mass of charred timbers, of black, drenched coals. But
  Pan was still on his pedestal, and the moon seemed to touch the inscription
  with a ghostly, meaningful hand. The lovers paused briefly to read it. Rose
  sighed through her tears. "The Lorans have paid the piper, all right, for all
  their dances. There are no more Lorans."</p>
