<h2><a id="ch0" name="ch0">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

<p class="first">'STRATEGY,' growled the General, 'is the
comfort of heroes.'</p>

<p>'And the science of Generals,' piped the little girl sitting
crossed-legged at his feet.</p>

<p>The old man looked down at her suspiciously under his white
shaggy brows and chuckled.</p>

<p>'I wish you were a boy,' he complained. The little girl
laughed shrilly and looked up at her grandfather with big
shining eyes, for if Katharine Westhanger adored any human being
in the world, it was the grim old man, white-maned and
eagle-faced, whose constant companion she was.</p>

<p>They sat under a big elm on a hot day in June.</p>

<p>From where they sat there was as cheerful a view as County
Galway could offer. On their left was the ancient home of the
Masserfields, of which General Sir Shaun Masserfield, that great
strategist, was the last representative in the tail male. Beyond
the house lay a big black field where leisurely labourers were
digging and stacking the peat. In a smaller field with broken
stone walls grazed four cows which formed the last of the
Masserfield stock.</p>

<p>It was a poor house and a poor estate. Poverty showed in the
broken windows of the east wing&mdash;visible from where they
sat&mdash;which had been long since abandoned to rats and mice
and lumber, in the peeling plaster work, in the unkempt garden,
even in the General's own shiny attire.</p>

<p>He looked down at the girl and smiled.</p>

<p>'Faith,' he said, 'ye've been reading strategy, have ye?'</p>

<p>Katharine nodded.</p>

<p>'Tis a wonderful science,' said Sir Shaun with a sigh. 'I've
written six books on the subject, and I've been robbed on every
one of 'em!'</p>

<p>An old man with bowed shoulders came out of the house, and
without hurrying made his way through the garden to pick those
dead leaves which caught and offended his eye. He came up to the
two and knuckled his forehead.</p>

<p>'The dinner is sarved, ye'r honour's lordship.'</p>

<p>The General got up with the aid of his stick.</p>

<p>'The dinner is sarved, Kate,' he repeated solemnly and hand
in hand they went back to the house, and over a leg of
pork&mdash;most untempting meal for a hot day, yet the General
and his granddaughter did it full justice&mdash;they resumed
their discussion on what was to the General the profoundest
subject that civilization offered.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that General Sir Shaun Masserfield
was an authority. His books, particularly his Modern Artillery
as Applied to the Principles of Strategy, have been translated
into every language. He was for many years at the head of a
department at the War Office, and at least two of his works have
been adopted as text-books for the Italian army.</p>

<p>The girl listened in silence as the old man waxed more and
more eloquent on his favourite subject, 'Napoleon's defeat of
Schwarzenberg' and those wonderful battles which led to the
armistice of 1814, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>'It seems such a waste,' she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her.</p>

<p>'Waste,' he roared, '&mdash;waste of what?'</p>

<p>'Of life and money and everything,' she said.</p>

<p>'Ye're a silly little donkey,' he growled. 'What can you know
about it, a child of thirteen!'</p>

<p>'Colonel Westhanger says&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Colonel Westhanger,' snapped the old man, 'is a fool and a
rascal! He is a bigger fool, and a bigger rascal, than your
father,' he added violently. 'The Westhangers are all fools, and
Molly Maguires. Bad luck to them! If teeth were diamonds, ye'd
have to live on pap!'</p>

<p>The little girl listened unmoved to this tirade against her
nearest relations.</p>

<p>'Colonel Westhanger says,' she continued, 'that if all the
genius which was put into war&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's little he has put in,' sneered the old man, 'the bould
militiaman!'</p>

<p>'He is in the regular army,' corrected the girl.</p>

<p>'It's nothing for the army to be proud of,' countered the
General, thumping the table with the handle of his knife; 'and
did he talk about strategy? The poor stupid man!'</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head laughingly. 'Oh, General,' she said
(she never called him by any other term), 'of course he didn't
talk about strategy. He only said what a waste it was of money,
and life, and everything.'</p>

<p>'And he put money first, I'll swear.'</p>

<p>'Of life and everything,' said the girl, not noticing the
interruption, 'when all the science and cleverness could be
applied to making money.'</p>

<p>'To making money!' repeated the General triumphantly. 'That
is the sort of fool he is. He couldn't make money by strategy or
anything else. God knows what is going to happen to you when I
die, for this estate goes to my own brother's son, a miserable
reptile of an Orangeman, and your father is no more capable of
keeping you than I am of being dishonest.'</p>

<p>He cut himself another thick slice of pork before he spoke
again, and then he asked a little curiously, as though he had
been turning the matter over in his mind&mdash;'And how would
a knowledge of strategy help a man to make money?' he asked.</p>

<p>The girl rolled up her serviette before she replied.</p>

<p>'There are many ways,' she said quietly, 'but I don't think
that Colonel Westhanger or father could make it. They aren't
great strategists like us,' she said calmly.</p>

<p>The old man chuckled.</p>

<p>'Us!' he repeated; 'and how would you make money?'</p>

<p>Katharine Westhanger shook her head. 'I cannot tell you right
off,' she said; 'there are so many ways.'</p>

<p>'Give me one,' asked the General, pushing back his chair.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said slowly, 'suppose we sent Terence down to the
railway station and took the grease cap off his wheel, and when
he got to the road past the O'Gormans' the wheel came off. What
would Terence do?'</p>

<p>She looked up at the ceiling and worked out each development
of the situation in slow, even tones.</p>

<p>'First of all Terence would go up to the O'Gormans' house,
and the Major's agent would lend him his grand new chaise.'</p>

<p>'Well, we could borrow it anyway,' said the General, 'so
what's the good of that foolery?'</p>

<p>'All the world would know we had borrowed the chaise to
impress the gentleman who is coming down from Dublin to buy your
pictures.'</p>

<p>'How did you know I was selling the pictures?' asked the
General sharply. It was a subject on which he was rather sore.
The two Vandykes which hung in the gaunt entrance hall of the
house represented the last of his valuable possessions, and only
the eccentric behaviour of certain Mexican stocks in which he
had invested many years before, and the consequent stoppage of
his income&mdash;he had long since mortgaged his
pension&mdash;would have induced him to part with these relics
of Masserfield prosperity.</p>

<p>'How did I know?' she answered; 'how does a General know what
is happening out of sight?'</p>

<p>'You have been spying,' he accused, but she shook her
head.</p>

<p>'Never mind how I know, dear,' she said; 'let me go on with
the story. Terence brings the fine stranger back, and we meet
him near the O'Gormans'. We go up to the O'Gormans' grand house
and we ask for the Major, who, being a good Irish landlord, is
now in London with Mrs. O'Gorman and the children.'</p>

<p>'The Major said I could use the house while he was away. He
has a fine library,' said the General.</p>

<p>'Take him to the library and show him the books. Have the
pictures waiting for him there&mdash;it's the surroundings that
count. Mrs. O'Shea, the Major's housekeeper, will do anything
for me.'</p>

<p>'Where's the strategy?' asked the old man.</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>'&ldquo;To compel the enemy to fight on chosen ground secures
for the attacker an advantage&mdash;&rdquo;'</p>

<p>'She's quoting my own book at me,' said the General in
despair; 'but why make a mystery of it? Why not go straight away
to Mrs. O'Shea, and tell her what you want to do?'</p>

<p>'We should then be there by design. Otherwise we shall be
there by accident,' said the girl decisively. 'If by design, the
enemy will know, for we shall be at the mercy of any chance word
which Mrs. O'Shea might drop. If by accident, our presence at
the Hall will be understood by both parties.'</p>

<p>'A tricky business,' growled the General. 'Kate, there's
either a great strategist, or a great criminal, lost in
you.'</p>

<p>She got up and pulled her skirts down over her thin legs.</p>

<p>'I don't think anything is lost yet,' she said
complacently.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THIS is one little glimpse of Katharine
Westhanger's childhood. It was a childhood spent almost entirely
in the company of old Shaun Masserfield, for the visits to her
disreputable father and her no less questionable uncle were few
and far between.</p>

<p>They were legally her trustees for the small property which
her mother had left, but which the General suspected, and the
girl knew, had long since been dissipated by her 'guardians,'
and it was necessary from time to time that they should make
some show of conferring with her. In the main she was alone,
'completing her education in Ireland,' as her father would
glibly explain.</p>

<p>She read much, thought a great deal, and she had the vast
experience of her grandfather to draw upon.</p>

<p>A year before his death, when she was nearing fifteen, an
event occurred which probably did more to shape the after-course
of her remarkable life than any other. There was a
jack-of-all-trades employed about the house who was variously
gardener, coachman, valet and general factotum to Sir Shaun.</p>

<p>Terence (he seems to have had no other name) was a townsman.
He had been born, and lived the earlier years of his life, in
the city of Dublin. Whatever might be his faults, he was devoted
to the girl, and there was no service which mortal man could
render that he hesitated to give.</p>

<p>One afternoon Kate was waited upon by an inspector of police.
Her grandfather had gone to bed with an attack of rheumatism,
and she received the officer of the law in the poverty-stricken
drawing-room with its framed photographs and mahogany
furniture.</p>

<p>'Good afternoon, Miss Westhanger,' said the inspector with a
cheery smile. 'I am sorry to bother you, but we are having a
little trouble in this neighbourhood, and I thought you might
help me.'</p>

<p>She knew well enough what the trouble was, before he began to
speak.</p>

<p>'In three weeks there have been three burglaries in this
neighbourhood, and it is very clear that the work is being done
by a local man. Major O'Gorman's, Lord Pretherston's and Mr.
Castlereigh's houses have been broken into and property has been
taken. All the stations have been watched and the roads have
been patrolled, and no strangers have been seen here or
hereabouts.'</p>

<p>'And do you think it is grandfather?' she asked
innocently.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>'No, miss,' he said; 'but it is very possible that it is
somebody in this house.'</p>

<p>'Me?' she asked with affected alarm.</p>

<p>'I put all my cards on the table, Miss. I think it is your
man Terence. He has had a conviction in Dublin, as I suppose you
know.'</p>

<p>'For burglary?'</p>

<p>'For petty larceny,' said the inspector. 'Can you tell me
where he was last night?'</p>

<p>She nodded. 'I can tell you almost all his movements between
six o'clock and eleven,' she said readily.</p>

<p>'The burglary was committed at ten, if you will excuse the
interruption, so that if you can account for Terence between
nine and ten that will satisfy me.'</p>

<p>'Won't you sit down, inspector?' She seated herself. 'At nine
o'clock, or perhaps it was ten minutes to nine, because the
dining-room clock is ten minutes fast, Terence came in with my
supper. The General was in bed, and Cassidy and his wife had
gone to see his mother, who is ill.'</p>

<p>'So that there were only you and Terence in the house?'</p>

<p>'And the General,' she smiled; 'but the General was in bed.
At half-past nine Terence cleared away, and at a quarter to ten
I rang the bell for my coffee. Then I remembered that the bell
was out of order, and went to the kitchen. When Terence brought
the coffee I was writing a letter, and I asked him to wait till
I had finished it because the bell not being in good working
order I didn't want to go down into the kitchen again as I did
for my coffee. The clock had struck ten before I had finished my
letter, and I then began another letter to Mullins the grocer,
which was finished by ten minutes past ten. Terence left the
house&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's all right,' interrupted the inspector, obviously
disappointed; 'it cannot be Terence, because the burglar was
seen to leave from the balcony of Lord Pretherston's house at
five minutes to ten. He was shot at when he was crossing the
lawn. I am sorry to have bothered you. By the way, where is he
now?' he asked.</p>

<p>'He is in the stable. Shall I call him?'</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated.</p>

<p>'No, it is not necessary. May I ask you not to mention the
fact that I called?'</p>

<p>She waited until she saw the police officer mount his horse
and, riding through the drive, go galloping along the ugly road
that led to the village, and then she rang the bell. The old
servitor appeared.</p>

<p>'Tell Terence I want him,' she said.</p>

<p>Terence came in a little apprehensively, a lank young man
with a smiling eye and with well-plastered hair. Terence had the
reputation of being a local dandy.</p>

<p>'Close the door, Terence,' said the girl quietly. 'What is
the matter with your hand?'</p>

<p>'I cut it, m'lady,' said Terence, putting the bandaged hand
behind him.</p>

<p>'You were shot,' said the girl calmly; 'you were shot while
you were crossing Lord Pretherston's lawn. Where do you keep the
loot?'</p>

<p>The man turned a sickly white. 'I'll swear...!'</p>

<p>'Don't be silly, Terence,' said the girl. 'Show me all you
have stolen.'</p>

<p>'For the Virgin's sake, Miss, don't betray me!' gasped
Terence. 'I must have been mad...!'</p>

<p>'You are being mad now,' said the girl coolly.</p>

<p>'Gee up. Don't make an exhibition of yourself! Show me where
all the things are you have stolen. You were out last night from
eight to ten-thirty. I saw you sneaking back to the house from
my window.'</p>

<p>At the back of the house was a big tool shed where the
peat-cutters kept their implements, and in the floor of this a
square hole had been dug, which had been cunningly framed in and
covered by a trap-door. The trap in its turn was hidden by a
large chest which had been drawn across it. Terence alone had
the key, and only Terence ever entered the little building.</p>

<p>'It took me a month to dig and fix it,' said Terence with
dismal pride. 'Oh, whirra!'</p>

<p>From the interior of the 'safe deposit' Terence extracted
three small handbags. Two of them were new, and one the girl
recognized as the property of her grandfather.</p>

<p>'Bring them to the house,' she said. She led the way to her
room, ushered him in and closed and locked the door. 'Now, we
will see what you have.'</p>

<p>It was a remarkable display, for the man's operations had
been thorough, and since most of his robberies had been
committed in a restricted period of time before the alarm had
spread, and householders had paid extra attention to the
fastening of their windows and the security of their valuables,
the haul had been amazingly big.</p>

<p>There was a pearl collar and a pearl necklace which the girl
recognized as Mrs. O'Gorman's. There were two big wads of
banknotes, and as far as the girl could judge about £200 in gold
contained in a little wash-leather bag.</p>

<p>'How could you get rid of the jewellery?' she asked.</p>

<p>The young man, a dejected figure sitting on the edge of a
chair, shook his melancholy head. 'Sure, 'twas a bad day for me
entirely when I came here,' he moaned.</p>

<p>'Listen, you wretched creature,' said the girl impatiently,
'how can you get rid of this jewellery?'</p>

<p>'I'd be selling it in Dublin, miss. There's an ould
man&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That will do,' she said. With skilful fingers she separated
the jewellery and packed it securely in a large cardboard box,
wrapping each jewel in paper.</p>

<p>'Where do you live in Dublin? Have you an address?' she
asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>'I stay wid my brother,' he said.</p>

<p>'Write his address down here.'</p>

<p>She gave him a sheet of paper, and after a moment's
hesitation he crossed to her little writing-table and
laboriously wrote.</p>

<p>'Now fill in this form,' she said. She took from her
stationery case a yellow parcels' post label and stood over the
man directing him. When he had finished she blotted the form,
took £5 from the heap of gold and handed it to him. Then she sat
down, her hands folded on her lap, her two steady eyes fixed
upon him.</p>

<p>'Terence,' she said, 'there is a train leaves Galway for
Dublin at eight o'clock tonight. It will take you three hours to
walk to Galway, or you can put the pony in the car and drive
over and leave it with Donoghue.'</p>

<p>He stared at her with mouth wide open.</p>

<p>'What will ye be afther doing, miss?' he whispered.</p>

<p>'I shall send these things on by parcels post. Go to your
brother's house. You should receive the parcel tomorrow
afternoon,' she said calmly. 'My advice to you is to sell the
jewels and get out of Ireland as quickly as you can. America is
a good place for a man with your ability.'</p>

<p>'And you are not sending for the police?' he asked after a
long pause.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>A slow cunning smile dawned on his face.</p>

<p>The arrogant thought which flowed through his shallow brain
was revealed when he said with a smirk, 'You may be getting
yourself into trouble for my sake, m'lady?'</p>

<p>She looked him up and down, and he wilted under the scorn in
her eyes.</p>

<p>'I shall have my reward, Terence,' she said steadily. 'I am
taking the money as my share.' She opened the drawer of her
table and swept the package of notes and the bag of gold into
its interior, then closed the drawer with a snap.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head in a gesture of bewilderment.</p>

<p>'Sure, miss, ye're joking!' he gasped. 'Why, if ye are found
out&mdash;if I give ye away...!'</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>'Go quickly, Terence,' she said quietly. 'If you walk you've
got three hours to consider what chance you have of being
believed.'</p>

<p>It took longer than three hours for Terence to settle the
matter to his satisfaction. He was still wrestling with the
problem a week later, from the deck of the big Cunarder when she
swung out of Queenstown Harbour.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE Earl of Flanborough pressed a bell-push by
the side of his study table, and, after an interval of exactly
three seconds, pressed it again, though the footman's lobby
could not have been far short of fifty yards from the library,
and the serving-man was never born who could sprint that
distance in three seconds.</p>

<p>Yet, in such awe was his lordship held that morning by his
man-servants, his maid-servants and everything within his gates,
that Sibble, the first footman, made the distance in five.</p>

<p>'Why the dickens didn't you answer my bell when I rang?'
snapped the Earl and glared at his red-faced servant. Sibble did
not reply, knowing by experience that, even as silence was
insolence, speech could be nothing less than impertinence.</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough was slightly over middle age, thin, bald and
dyspeptic. His face was mean and insignificant, and if you
looked for any resemblance to the somewhat pleasant faces of the
Feltons and Flanboroughs of past generations which stared mildly
or fiercely, or (as in the case of the first Baron Felton and
Flanborough, a poet and contemporary of Lovelace) with gentle
melancholy from their massive frames in the long hall, you
looked in vain. For George Percy Allington Felton, Earl of
Flanborough, Baron Felton and Baron Sedgely of Waybrook, was
only remotely related to the illustrious line of Feltons, and
had inherited the title and the heavily mortgaged estates of his
great-uncle by sheer bad luck. This was the uncharitable view of
truer Feltons who stood, however, more remotely in the line of
succession.</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough had been Mr. George Felton of Felton,
Heinrich &amp; Somes, a firm which controlled extensive mining
properties in various parts of the world, and the one bright
spot in his succession to the peerage lay in the fact that he
brought some two millions sterling to the task of freeing the
estates of their encumbrances. He was a shrewd man, and an
unpleasant man, but he had never been so objectionably
unpleasant until he assumed the style and title of Flanborough;
and never so completely and impossibly unpleasant in the period
of his lordship as he had been that morning.</p>

<p>'Now, what did I want you for?' asked Lord Flanborough in
vexation, 'I rang for something&mdash;if you had only answered
at once instead of dawdling about, I should&mdash;ah, yes
&mdash;tell Lady Moya that I wish to see her.'</p>

<p>Sibble made his escape thankfully. Lord Flanborough pulled at
his weedy moustache and looked at the virgin sheet of paper
before him. Then he took up his pen and wrote&mdash;</p>

<p>'LOST OR STOLEN</p>

<p>'Valuable pearl chain, consisting of eighty-three graduated
pearls. Any person giving information which will lead to its
recovery will receive a reward of two hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>He paused, scratched out 'two hundred pounds' and substituted
'one hundred pounds.' This did not satisfy him, and he altered
the sum to 'fifty pounds.' He sat considering even this modest
figure, and eventually struck out that amount and wrote, 'will
be suitably rewarded.'</p>

<p>He heard the door click, and looked up. 'Ah&mdash;Moya. I am
just tinkering away at an advertisement,' he said with a smile.
The Lady Moya Felton was twenty-two and pretty. She recollected
in her admirable person many of the traditional family graces
which had so malignantly avoided her parent. Well-shaped and of
a gracious carriage, though no more than medium in height, the
face with its delicacy of moulding was wholly Felton. If the
stubborn chin, the firm mouth and the china-blue eyes had come
from the dead and gone Sedgelys, the hair of bronze gold was
peculiarly Feltonesque. When she spoke, however, the carping
critic might complain that the voice lacked the rich quality
upon which the family prided itself, for the Feltons were
orators in those days when a parliamentary speech read like
something out of a book. Moya's voice was a trifle hard and
without body; it was also just a little unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough boasted with good cause that his daughter
was a 'practical little woman,' and at least one man beside her
father could testify to this quality.</p>

<p>'Dear, don't you think it is a little
absurd&mdash;advertising?' asked the girl. She seated herself at
the other side of the desk and, reaching out her hand, opened a
silver box and helped herself to one of her father's
cigarettes.</p>

<p>'Why absurd, darling?' asked Lord Flanborough testily. 'Lost
property has been found, before now, by means of advertising. I
remember, years ago when I was in the city, there was a fellow
named Goldberg&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Please forget all about the city for a moment,' she smiled
lighting her cigarette, 'and review all the circumstances.
Firstly, I had the pearls when I was at Lady Machinstone's
house. I danced with quiet, respectable people&mdash;Sir Ralph
Sapson, Sir George Felixburn, Lord Fethington, Major Aitkens,
and that awfully nice boy of Machinstones'. They didn't steal
them. I had the pearls when I left, because I saw them as I was
fastening my fur cloak. I had them in the car, because I touched
them just before we reached the house. I don't remember taking
them off&mdash;but then I was dead tired and hardly remember
going to bed. Obviously, Martin is the thief. She is the only
person who has access to my room, she helped me undress; it is
as plain as a pikestaff.'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough tapped his large white teeth with his
pen-holder, a practice of his which annoyed his daughter beyond
words, though at the moment she deemed it expedient to overlook
the fault. The loss had frightened her, for the pearls were
worth three thousand pounds, and she was one of those people
whose standard of values had a currency basis.</p>

<p>'I have asked Scotland Yard to send their very best man,'
said Lord Flanborough importantly. 'Where is Martin?'</p>

<p>'Locked in her room. I have told Fellows to sit outside her
door,' said the girl, and then interestedly, 'When will the
detective arrive?'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough picked up an open telegraph form from the
table. '&ldquo;Sending Inspector Pretherston&rdquo;&mdash;by
Jove!' He blinked across the desk at his daughter.</p>

<p>'Pretherston,' she repeated thoughtfully, 'isn't it
strange?'</p>

<p>'Pretherston&mdash;hum,' said her father, and looked at her
again. If he expected to see any confusion, any heightening of
colour, even so much as a faltering of glance, he was relieved,
for she met his gaze steadfastly, save that there was a far-away
look in her eyes, and a certain speculative narrowing of
lids.</p>

<p>The romance was five years old, and if she cherished the
memory of it, it was the charity which she might show to a
favoured piece in her china cupboard; it was something to be
taken out and dusted at intervals.</p>

<p>Michael Pretherston was a bad match from every point of view,
though his invalid cousin was a peer of the realm and Michael
would one day be Pretherston of Pretherston. He was hideously
poor, he was casual, he had no respect for wealth, he held the
most outrageous views on the church, society and the state; he
was, in fact, something as nearly approaching an anarchist as
Lord Flanborough ever expected or feared to meet. His wooing had
been brief but tempestuous. The girl had been overwhelmed and
had given her promise. Recovering her reason in the morning, and
realizing (as she said) that love was not 'everything,' she had
written him a letter of fourteen pages in which she had
categorically set forth the essential conditions to their union.
These called for the abandonment of all his principles, the
re-establishment of all his shattered beliefs and an estimate of
the cost of placing Pretherston Court in a state of repair for
the reception of the Lady Moya Pretherston (née Felton).</p>

<p>To her fourteen pages, he had returned a thirty-two-page
letter which was at once an affront and a justification for
anarchy. It was not a love-letter, rather was it something
between a pamphlet by Henry George and a treatise by Jean
Jacques Rousseau, interspersed with passionate appeals to her
womanhood and offensive references to her 'huckster-souled'
father.</p>

<p>'He was always a wild sort of chap,' said Lord Flanborough;
shaking his head darkly. 'I understood that he had gone
abroad.'</p>

<p>'I suppose there are other Pretherstons,' said the girl;
'still it is strange, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Do you ever feel...?' began her father awkwardly. She
smiled and laid down her cigarette on the crystal ash-tray.</p>

<p>'He was wholly impossible,' she agreed. There came a gentle
tap at the door and a girl entered. She was dressed neatly in
black, and her prettiness was of a different type to that of her
employer (for Lady Moya indulged in the luxury of a
secretary).</p>

<p>It was a beautiful face, with a hint of tragedy in the
downturned lips, and, it seemed, a history of mild sorrow in her
big grey eyes. Yet of sorrow she knew nothing, and such tragedy
as she had met had left her unmoved. Her abundant hair was of a
rich brown, the hand that clasped a note-book to her bosom was
small and artistic. She was an inch taller than Lady Moya, but
because she did not show the same erectness of carriage, she
seemed shorter.</p>

<p>'Father, you asked me to let you have Miss Tenby this
morning,' said Lady Moya, with a nod for the girl. 'I don't know
whether you will still want her!'</p>

<p>'I am so sorry this dreadful thing has happened, Lord
Flanborough,' said the girl in a low voice; 'it must be terrible
to feel that there is a thief in the house.'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough smiled good-humouredly.</p>

<p>'We shall recover the pearls, I am certain,' he said. 'Don't
let it worry you, Miss Tenby&mdash;I hope you are
comfortable?'</p>

<p>'Very, Lord Flanborough,' said the girl gratefully.</p>

<p>'And the work is not too hard, eh?'</p>

<p>The girl smiled slightly.</p>

<p>'It is nothing&mdash;I feel awfully ashamed of myself
sometimes. I have been with you a month, and have hardly earned
my salt.'</p>

<p>'That's all right,' replied his lordship with great
condescension, 'You have already been of the greatest assistance
to me and we shall find you plenty of other work. I was glad to
see you in church on Sunday. The vicar tells me that you are a
regular attendant.'</p>

<p>The girl inclined her head, but said nothing. For a while she
waited, and then at a word of polite dismissal she left the
library.</p>

<p>'Deuced nice girl, that,' said his lordship approvingly.</p>

<p>'She works well and quickly, and she can read French
beautifully&mdash;I was very fortunate,' said Moya
carelessly.</p>

<p>'What were we talking about when she came in? Oh, yes&mdash;
Michael Pretherston. I wonder now&mdash;'</p>

<p>The door opened and a footman announced&mdash;'Inspector
Pretherston, m'lord.'</p>

<p>'Inspector Michael Pretherston, you silly ass,' corrected the
annoyed young man in the doorway. It was Michael then!</p>

<p>A little older, a little better-looking, a little more
decisive&mdash;but Michael as impetuous and irresponsible as
ever.</p>

<p>'He spoilt my entrance, Moya,' he laughed as he came with
rapid strides toward the girl. 'How are you after all these
years?&mdash;as pretty as ever, confound you! Ah, Lord
Flanborough, you're wearing well&mdash;I read your speech in the
House of Lords on the Shipping Bill&mdash;a fine speech, did you
make it up your self?'</p>

<p>Moya laughed softly, and saved what might have been a most
embarrassing situation&mdash;for his lordship was framing a
dignified protest against the suggestion that he had shared the
honours of authorship.</p>

<p>'You are not changed, Michael,' she said, looking at him with
undisguised, but none the less detached admiration; 'but what on
earth are you doing in the police force?'</p>

<p>'Extraordinary,' murmured Lord Flanborough, and added
humorously, 'and an anarchist, too!'</p>

<p>'It is a long story,' said Michael. 'I really received my
promotion in the Special Branch&mdash;the Foreign Office
branch&mdash;and was transferred to the C.I.D. after we caught
the Callam crowd, the continental confidence tricksters. It is
disgraceful that I should be an inspector, isn't it? But merit
tells!'</p>

<p>He chuckled again, then of a sudden grew serious.</p>

<p>'I'm forgetting I've a job to do&mdash;what's the
trouble?'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough explained the object of his urgent call, and
a look of disappointment appeared upon Michael Pretherston's
face.</p>

<p>'A miserable little larceny,' he said reproachfully. 'I
thought at least Moya had been kidnapped. Now, tell me all that
happened on the night you lost the pearls.'</p>

<p>Step by step the girl related her movements, and the periods
at which she had evidence that the pearls were still with
her.</p>

<p>'And then you reached your bedroom,' said Michael, 'and what
happened there? First of all, you took your fur wrap off.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' nodded the girl.</p>

<p>'Were you in a cheerful frame of mind or were you rather
cross?'</p>

<p>'Does that matter?' she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'Everything matters to the patient and systematic officer of
the law. Temperamental clues are as interesting and material as
any other.'</p>

<p>'Well, if the truth were told,' she confessed, 'I was rather
cross and very tired.'</p>

<p>'Did you take your cloak off, or did your woman?'</p>

<p>'I took it off myself,' she said, after a pause, 'and hung it
up.'</p>

<p>He asked her few more questions.</p>

<p>'Now we will see the sorrowful Martin,' he said; 'and let me
tell you this, Moya, that if this girl is innocent, she has
grounds for action against you for false imprisonment.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' demanded Lord Flanborough with asperity.
'I have a perfect right to detain anybody I think is guilty of
theft.'</p>

<p>'You have no more right to lock a woman in a room,' said the
other calmly, 'than I have to stand you on your head. But that
is beside the point. Lead me to the prisoner.'</p>

<p>The prisoner was very pale and very tearful, a middle-aged
woman who felt her position acutely, and between sobs and wails
made an incoherent protest of her innocence.</p>

<p>'I suppose you have searched everywhere?' asked Michael,
turning to the girl.</p>

<p>'Everywhere,' she replied emphatically. 'I have had every box
and every corner of the room examined.'</p>

<p>'Suppose the string of the pearls broke, would they all fall
off?'</p>

<p>'No, they would still remain on, because each pearl was
secured. Father gave them to me as a birthday present, and he
was very particular on that point.'</p>

<p>'I would like to bet,' said Michael suddenly, 'that those
pearls are not out of this room. Show me your wardrobe.'</p>

<p>The girl's wardrobe occupied the whole of one wall of her
dressing-room, and the tearful Martin opened the rosewood doors
for his inspection.</p>

<p>'This your fur coat, I presume? Did you examine this after
the loss?'</p>

<p>'Examine the cloak!' said Lady Moya in surprise; 'of course
not. What has the cloak to do with the loss? There are no
pockets in it.'</p>

<p>'But if I know anything about the fur cloaks that are
fashionable this season,' said Michael wisely, 'I should say
that there is a possibility that this luxurious garment had a
great deal to do with the loss. In fact, my dear Moya,' he said,
'your mysterious loss has been duplicated and triplicated this
year. In two cases the police were called in, and in the other
case the owner had the intelligence to find her lost trinket
without assistance.' He lifted the cloak down very carefully and
opened it to show the silk lining, and there, caught in one of
the long flat hooks, dangled the pearls.</p>

<p>The girl uttered an exclamation of delight and slipped them
from its fastening.</p>

<p>'Wonderful, isn't it?' said Michael drily. 'That is what has
happened, not three times but half a dozen times since these
flat hooks have been introduced. You take the cloak off in a bad
temper, the hook catches the chain, breaks it, you bundle the
cloak in your wardrobe, and there you have the beginning of a
great jewel mystery.'</p>

<p>'I can't tell you how delighted I am,' said the girl.
'Michael, you're wonderful!'</p>

<p>Michael did not reply. He turned to the frightened waiting
woman with a kindly smile. 'I am so sorry you have been worried
about this, Mrs. Martin,' he said; 'but when people lose very
valuable property they are also inclined to lose their very
valuable heads. I am sure Lady Moya is sorry, and will make you
due compensation for any inconvenience you have been put
to.'</p>

<p>The girl stared at him resentfully.</p>

<p>'Of course, I am awfully sorry, Martin,' she said coldly.</p>

<p>'Oh, my lady,' said the woman eagerly, 'I am only too pleased
that you have recovered your chain. The worry of it has made me
quite ill.'</p>

<p>'You can have a week's holiday,' said Lord Flanborough
magnificently. 'I will get you a free railway ticket to
Seahampton,' he added.</p>

<p>'So you see, Mrs. Martin,' said Michael, with that bland air
of his which scarcely veiled the sarcasm so irritating to his
lordship, 'your generous employers will leave no stone unturned
to minister to your comfort, regardless of expense. And when you
are at Seahampton, Mrs. Martin (I trust you will not lose the
return half of your free ticket) you will be allowed to walk up
and down the promenade on equal terms with the aristocracy and
breathe the ozone which, ordinarily, is created for your
betters. You may sit on the free seats and watch the pageant of
life step past you, and, reflecting upon the generosity of your
betters, you may appreciate the good fortune which brought you
into hourly contact with the aristocracy of England. And on
Sundays, Mrs. Martin, you may go to church where quite a number
of the seats are also free and may even share a hymn-book with a
Gracious Person who is so vastly above you in social standing
that he will never recognize you again, and there, I trust, you
will pray with a new fervour that the deliberations of the House
of Lords may receive divine inspiration.'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed I will, sir,' said Mrs. Martin, almost stunned by
his eloquence. He left the woman overwhelmed, and returned with
a very ruffled Lord Flanborough and an indignant Moya to the
library.</p>

<p>'What utter nonsense you talk, Michael!' said the girl
angrily. 'I don't think it was kind of you to attempt to set my
servants against me.'</p>

<p>'Beastly bad taste,' said Lord Flanborough, 'and really,
Pretherston, you came here as an officer of the law and not as
an old acquaintance, and I think that you exceed your duties, if
you don't mind my saying so.'</p>

<p>'Old acquaintances,' said Michael, picking up his hat and his
coat from a chair where he had put them before the interview,
'are especially made to be forgotten, a peculiarity of which one
is reminded in that Bacchanalian anthem which is sung at all
public dinners where sobriety is bad form. I was merely
endeavouring to inculcate into the mind of your slave a few
moral principles, beneficial to you, and to society.'</p>

<p>'Don't tell me that,' growled Lord Flanborough, 'as though I
didn't recognize your sarcasm.'</p>

<p>'Children, and the lower orders, never recognize sarcasm,'
said Michael with a broad smile. He held out his hand and
somewhat reluctantly his lordship extended his own flabby
paw.</p>

<p>'Before I go,' he said, 'I suppose I had better take a full
account of this case. You haven't a secretary or anybody to whom
you can dictate the circumstances? You see, I have to make a
report to my cold-blooded superiors.'</p>

<p>Moya had reached the stage where the remains of her
friendship with Michael Pretherston had not only died, but had
been cremated in the fires of her smothered anger, and she was
as anxious to see the end of this interview as was her
father.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you will ring for Miss Tenby,' she said after a
pause. Her father pressed the bell and the waiting Sibble
answered it.</p>

<p>'Send Miss Tenby,' said his lordship.</p>

<p>'And I do hope, Michael,' said the girl severely, 'that when
Miss Tenby is here you will not make such extravagant comments
as you did before Martin.'</p>

<p>'Miss Tenby,' interposed Lord Flanborough, 'will not welcome
such talk. She is a young girl with&mdash;er&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know, I know,' said Michael solemnly, 'she is genteel. She
does forty words a minute on the typewriter and goes to church,
filling in her odd moments with needlework and accompanying you
on the piano.'</p>

<p>'It must be a wonderful thing to be a detective,' said Moya
sarcastically. 'As a matter of fact, Miss Tenby is one of the
fastest typists in the world.'</p>

<p>Michael swung round on her with an odd look on his face.</p>

<p>'Fastest typists in the world,' he repeated, with all the
humour gone out of his tone. 'Does she sing?'</p>

<p>It was the girl's turn to be astonished.</p>

<p>'Yes, she does, and very beautifully.'</p>

<p>'Does she prefer Italian opera?' he asked.</p>

<p>At this the girl laughed aloud. 'Somebody has been telling
you all about her, and you are trying to be mysterious,' she
accused. Further conversation was cut short by the arrival of
the girl, who walked in, closed the door, and came straight to
the desk.</p>

<p>She stopped dead at the sight of Michael. Moya saw the
meeting, saw the girl stiffen and her sorrowful eyes fixed upon
the detective's face.</p>

<p>'Why, Kate!' said Michael Pretherston softly. 'Well, well,
well! and to think that we meet again under such noble
auspices.'</p>

<p>Miss Tenby said nothing.</p>

<p>'And what is the great game?' asked Michael banteringly.
'What beautiful impulse brought you to this sheltered home, and
how is the Colonel and friend Gregori and all those dear boys?
By the way, the Colonel must be out by now, Kate. What did he
get&mdash;three years?'</p>

<p>Still Miss Tenby made no reply.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this?' demanded Lord Flanborough,
feeling that the moment had arrived to assert himself. 'Do you
know this lady?'</p>

<p>'Do I know her?' said Michael ecstatically. 'Why, I am one of
her greatest admirers; am I not, Kate?'</p>

<p>The girl's sad face softened to a smile which showed the
regular lines of her white teeth. She spoke, and her voice was
gentle and appealing.</p>

<p>'It is perfectly true, Lord Flanborough,' she said quietly,
'Mr. Pretherston knows me. He also knows that my uncle, Colonel
Westhanger, was mixed up in a very serious scandal which brought
him within the reach of the law. It is perfectly true that when
I was a little girl I was known as Kate. It is just as true that
I am trying now to live down my association with law-breakers,
and am trying to rehabilitate myself in the world.'</p>

<p>'H'm!' murmured Lord Flanborough, a little taken aback, 'very
creditable.'</p>

<p>Moya turned to Michael indignantly.</p>

<p>'I suppose that you think you are rendering a great service
to the world, in trying to drag this poor girl down to the
gutter, in exposing her to her employers, and in obtaining her
dismissal from honest employment.'</p>

<p>'I do,' said Michael shamelessly.</p>

<p>'I think it is a barbarous thing to do!' said Moya angrily.
She had not yet decided in her own mind as to what steps she
would take in face of this revelation. In view of her own
character, it is possible that 'Miss Tenby' would have a very
short shift at her hands. But for the moment the opportunity for
the display of benevolence and Christian charity was not to be
passed over. She saw the girl's appealing eyes and clasped
hands, and, for a moment, she felt a sincere thrill of pity for
a brave sister struggling to escape the octopus tentacles of law
and crime; for a moment she felt a genuinely unselfish desire to
help another.</p>

<p>If she expected Inspector the Hon. Michael
Pretherston&mdash;for such was his incongruous title&mdash;to
wilt under her reproaches, she was disappointed. Michael had not
taken his eyes from the secretary, nor had the twinkle in those
eyes abated. He nodded to 'Miss Tenby.'</p>

<p>'Kate,' he said, 'you are really a wonder, and to think that
you have never yet come into the clutches of the law until
now.'</p>

<p>'Until now,' said the girl, quickly raising her voice.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'The Prevention of Crimes Act,' murmured Michael. 'I can take
you'&mdash;he emphasized the 'can'&mdash;'on a charge of
obtaining employment with forged letters of recommendation, also
with being a Suspected Person.'</p>

<p>The girl dropped her attitude of humility, threw back her
head and laughed, showing her even white teeth.</p>

<p>'Oh, you Mike!' she railed him. 'Oh, you busy fellow!'</p>

<p>Her amusement did not last long, for instantly her face was
set again and the grey eyes blazed with rage. 'One of these days
you will be too clever,' she said bitterly. 'I have seen better
men than you, and cleverer men than you, go out, Michael
Pretherston. You and your Prevention of Crimes Act! You can't
put that bluff over me. The Act does not come into operation
until you have a conviction against my name, and that you will
never get, you brute!'</p>

<p>'Kate, Kate!' murmured Michael, 'there's a lady present!'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'I guess I'll get my kit together,' she said; 'it hasn't been
exactly a holiday trip.'</p>

<p>'My sympathies are entirely with you,' said Michael; 'it must
have been awfully dull after the gay orgies of Crime
Street.'</p>

<p>'There is one thing I have always wanted to know,' said the
girl, pinching her lip thoughtfully. She walked to the desk, and
Lord Flanborough was too much taken aback to arrest her
progress. Without a word she opened the silver box on the table
and took out a cigarette. 'I have always wanted to know what
kind of dope this dear old gentleman smoked.'</p>

<p>She looked at the cigarette critically, and with an
exclamation of disgust threw it back on the desk.</p>

<p>'Gold Flavours!' she said scornfully. 'Can you beat it, Mike?
And he has a hundred thousand a year!'</p>

<p>'You must make allowances for the decadence of the governing
classes,' said the soothing Michael. He turned and nodded
farewell to Moya, and with Miss Tenby's arm in his, he passed
out of the room, and Lord Flanborough and his daughter looked at
one another in speechless amazement.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="first">'YOU might do worse than lunch with me,' said
Michael Pretherston. He stood outside Felton House with the
girl, whose belongings in one small Gladstone bag had been
deposited on the kerb, pending the arrival of a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>'Why should I lunch with you?' she asked insolently. 'I
thought you were going to pinch me.'</p>

<p>'Your vulgarity is appalling!' said Michael, shaking his head
in reproof. 'I cannot pinch you in the vulgar sense. I have no
desire to perform that operation in the corporeal sense. You had
better compromise and lunch with me.'</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. 'Think of my reputation,' she said.</p>

<p>'Thoughts of your reputation keep me awake at night,'
answered Michael lightly, and called a taxi.</p>

<p>They found a little restaurant in Soho, and in an underground
cellar where the bad ventilation was compensated for by a blaze
of light, they ate their simple little meal.</p>

<p>'Now, Kate, I want to ask you what your little game is,' said
Michael, 'and I need the information because I know it isn't a
little game.'</p>

<p>'I was scared sick over those pearls,' said the girl,
ignoring the question; 'it would have been horribly bad luck to
have been taken for a job I had nothing to do with, and such a
paltry job too!'</p>

<p>'You owe me something,' said Michael.</p>

<p>'I owe you more than I can ever repay you,' said the girl
significantly.</p>

<p>'I suppose one of these days,' suggested the detective, after
an interval of thought, 'you will instruct some of your hired
pals, Gregori or the Colonel or little Stockmar, to inflict on
me a painful injury.'</p>

<p>'You!' said the girl scornfully; 'if there were not men like
you in the police, we should have been destroyed years ago! You
are a sort of an insurance scheme, and it pays us to keep you
alive and well. Why, Crime Street would go into mourning the day
you were buried.'</p>

<p>'You are not trying to be rude to me, are you?' he asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him slyly from under her long lashes, and her
eyes were dancing with fun.</p>

<p>'Why do you think I went to Lord Flanborough?' she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. 'I'm blessed if I know,' he confessed. 'Of
course I knew it was you the moment I heard of the rapid
typewriting and the Italian songs. Now listen: I am not trying
to speak to you for your good ...'</p>

<p>'Don't!' she said laconically.</p>

<p>'But I have often wondered why a well-educated girl and a
nice girl, as far as I know to the contrary, should prefer the
life of a crook to ...'</p>

<p>'To earning £2 or £3 a week and working all day to earn it,'
she finished for him. 'To living my life in one little room on a
top floor in Bloomsbury, waiting my turn every morning for my
bath. To being made love to by the assistant manager! I have had
the experience for professional purposes and I don't like it a
bit, Mike.' She looked at him straight in the eyes. She had
dropped her air of flippancy, her slang; the voice that spoke
was not to be distinguished from that of any other
gentlewoman.</p>

<p>'You see, a woman is differently circumstanced to a man. She
wants nice things, and her attitude toward life, and indeed the
whole of her conduct, depends entirely upon the degree of
niceness she requires. Men don't do things for women for
nothing. They lend to their men friends all the money in the
world, and are grateful if they get it back. They expect nothing
more than their money, and are surprised when they get it. But
if I were a typist in a city office, and I borrowed £2 from the
assistant manager or from the chief book-keeper, or a fiver from
one of the partners, why, Mike, I should be booked for supper on
Wednesday. Suppose a man lent you £2 and asked you in exchange,
not only to repay the money, but to renounce all your dearest
principles for the sake of the loan; if he asked you to betray
the friends you had been loyal to, and lie where you had been
truthful; break your word where you had been faithful, be a
thief where you had been honest&mdash;would you surrender every
reticence, every honourable instinct, every precious faith?'</p>

<p>Mike said nothing. For there was nothing to say. He paid the
bill and escorted the girl to a cab.</p>

<p>'I am not going to be sorry for you,' he said. 'You are
having The Life. One of these days I shall come along and take
you; but I shall hate it. Hop it, Kate!'</p>

<p>Kate literally hopped into the waiting taxi, waved her hand
in farewell and was gone.</p>

<p>Michael Pretherston stood for fully five minutes on the edge
of the pavement meditating upon what the girl had said. She had
struck a responsive note in his soul, for she spoke no more than
was the truth, as he knew. He went, a little sadly, back to
headquarters, remembering en route that he had forgotten to
write the report.</p>

<p>Should he go back to the Yard and compose it from memory, or
should he return to the unsympathetic atmosphere of Felton
House?</p>

<p>He decided upon the latter, and surprised Lord Flanborough in
the act of taking an afternoon nap.</p>

<p>Michael was full of apologies and was so unusually respectful
that his lordship forgot to be annoyed.</p>

<p>'Moya's out,' he explained.</p>

<p>'I will endeavour to bear up,' replied Michael, seating
himself at his lordship's desk, and preparing to take a note of
the circumstances which had led to his lordship's call for
assistance. He finished the report, blotted and folded it and
placed the document in his pocket.</p>

<p>'I want to ask you one or two questions, and they concern
Kate&mdash;or Miss Tenby as you call her. I'm afraid I gave you
a shock this morning.'</p>

<p>'It was certainly a surprise,' admitted Lord Flanborough
cautiously. 'Who is this Kate? We have made a very careful
search of the house, but nothing is missing so far as we can
tell.'</p>

<p>Mike laughed.</p>

<p>'You needn't worry about that. Kate is not a pilferer. Her
real name is Katharine Westhanger; they call her Kate and she is
the Colonel's niece. Her age is nineteen or twenty, and from a
child she has been brought up to regard the world as her oyster.
Her mother was a wholesome parson's daughter; her father was a
rascal who was kicked out of the army in '89 for an offence
against the law of property. Her maternal grandfather was
General Sir Shaun Masserfield, who was a neighbour of my
brother's in Ireland and the greatest strategist the British
army has ever held&mdash;Kate inherits his genius, but has not
learnt his code. Her father died when she was sixteen, and her
uncle, who is a greater scoundrel than her father was&mdash;the
family on the Westhanger side has a criminal history which goes
back at intervals for two hundred years&mdash;completed her
education. Kate has been brought up to be a thief, but a big
thief. She is, I believe the brains of the biggest criminal
organization in the world. Every member of the gang has been
taken, but no evidence has ever been offered against Kate. She
plans the big swindles, and each one is bigger than the
last&mdash;but never once have we traced the offence to her
door.'</p>

<p>'Why is it that the police&mdash;?' began Lord
Flanborough.</p>

<p>'The police, my dear Flanborough,' said Michael wearily, 'are
human beings who have to deal with human beings. They are not
angels, nor thought-readers, nor are they clairvoyant. The laws
of this country are so framed that the criminal has six chances
to every one possessed by his enemy. We know Kate was concerned
in that big bank-smashing exploit which took two million crowns
from the treasury of the Bank of Holland. It was Kate who
organized the raid upon the London jewellers in June of last
year. Kate is the mother of Crime Street. You don't know that
thoroughfare, but one of these days I'll introduce you to it, if
you are curious&mdash;but I warn you that if you expect to steep
your soul in sordidness, you will be disappointed&mdash;it is
the most respectable street in London. Her ingenuity is
remarkable, her patience beyond praise, and that is partly why I
have come back; I want to know why she was here, and what she
was doing?'</p>

<p>'As I say&mdash;' began Lord Flanborough again.</p>

<p>'For Heaven's sake,' interrupted Michael, 'don't tell me that
you haven't missed things! I tell you Kate would not touch a pin
in your house. In the first place she is a well-off woman. Why
in Heaven's name should she bother her head about your
belongings? I don't suppose, if she had the full run of your
house, she could find £100 worth of realizable property! No,
that is not why Kate came to you. How long has she been
here?'</p>

<p>'Nearly a month,' said Lord Flanborough, a little annoyed
that the result of his own private investigations had so utterly
failed to impress a representative of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>'What work has she been doing?'</p>

<p>'Ordinary secretarial work for Moya. She came with excellent
letters of recommendation.'</p>

<p>'You can forget those,' interrupted Michael testily. 'The
gentleman who wrote them lives at Number 9, Crime Street, and
his name is Millet.'</p>

<p>'She was a wonderful typist,' began his lordship, who was
seeking about in his own mind for some excuse which would
explain why he had been deceived.</p>

<p>'That I also know. She is, as you say, one of the fastest
typists in the world. In fact, no aspect of her education has
been neglected. She speaks five languages, and read French
fluently when she was nine. What work has she done for you?'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough considered for a while.</p>

<p>'She has copied a few letters and reports.'</p>

<p>'What kind of reports?'</p>

<p>'Reports from our South African companies. You see, Michael,
I still retain the direction of most of my old interests.'</p>

<p>'Were they very important&mdash;the reports, I mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes and no,' replied Lord Flanborough slowly, 'they were
merely reports of output, cost of production and projected
shipments.'</p>

<p>'On what other work was she employed?'</p>

<p>'Let me think,' said Lord Flanborough.</p>

<p>'I am letting you!' replied Michael tartly. 'You used to have
a very private code-book if I remember rightly.'</p>

<p>'That is true,' said Lord Flanborough, 'but of course she did
not see that.'</p>

<p>'Where did you keep it?'</p>

<p>'In my desk,' said Lord Flanborough.</p>

<p>'Is it possible that she could have seen it!'</p>

<p>'It is possible, but wholly impossible that she could have
copied it.'</p>

<p>'For how long a time together was she left alone?'</p>

<p>'Five minutes was the longest period she was left in the
library alone,' said his lordship after consideration.</p>

<p>Michael fingered his chin.</p>

<p>'Did you ever come into the library and find her in a
semi-fainting condition?' he asked.</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough looked at him with open-mouthed
amazement.</p>

<p>'Did she tell you?'</p>

<p>Michael shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, she has told me nothing. I gather from your question
that there was such an occurrence?'</p>

<p>'It is remarkable that you should ask the question,' said his
lordship. 'I did come in one morning to find the poor
girl&mdash;er&mdash;the wretched girl&mdash;in a state of
collapse.'</p>

<p>'And you went out and got her a glass of water and sent for
your housekeeper, I suppose,' said Michael, his lip curling.</p>

<p>'Yes, I did,' admitted his lordship.</p>

<p>'Which means, in plain language,' smiled Michael, 'that you
surprised her in the act of examining some of your private
documents, and that whilst you were getting the water and
calling assistance, she was replacing whatever she was looking
at where she had found it. Did she on any other occasion draw
your attention, on your entering the room, to some peculiar
circumstance, such as one of the pictures not hanging straight
or a broken vase?'</p>

<p>Again Lord Flanborough looked astounded.</p>

<p>'Yes, once she pointed to the china cupboard, and asked me
who cracked the glass. As a matter of fact, the glass was not
cracked at all,' he explained.</p>

<p>'But you went over and examined it?'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said his lordship.</p>

<p>'That was exactly the same trick,' said Michael. 'Whilst you
were making your inspection she was able to replace any
documents she had been examining and close the drawer&mdash;if
they were in a drawer. Now, I wonder what her game is?'</p>

<p>'You don't suggest,' began his lordship in alarm, 'that she
is scheming to rob me?'</p>

<p>'I hope not,' said Michael gravely. 'From the idea of your
being robbed, the imagination reels.'</p>

<p>'I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic. I am afraid you have
never quite forgiven Moya&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I bless Moya every time I think of her,' said Michael
quickly. 'She rendered me the greatest service that one human
being could render to another, when she refused me. I hope to do
better than Moya. As Moya's father, you utter a pained protest.
I know, I know,' said Michael, and he waved his hand cheerfully
from the door.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="first">MICHAEL PRETHERSTON was back at the Yard in
time to catch his chief before he departed for the day.</p>

<p>Commissioner T.B. Smith, to whose recommendation this young
scion of the aristocracy owed his promotion was not helpful.</p>

<p>'If we took Kate on any charge it would not prevent the
swindle going forward,' he said. 'You may be sure she has
mobilized all her resources, and her little army is ready to the
last button of the last gaiter. There is supposed to be a fellow
watching her all the time, but he seems to have missed her
rather cleverly. Anyway, I don't think there is much to be
gained from shadowing her, because she knows she is under
observation and acts accordingly. But I have a word of advice to
you, my young Hibernian friend, and that is to keep a sharp eye
on your own precious life. Kate is afraid of you.'</p>

<p>'She didn't give me that impression this afternoon,' said
Michael sadly.</p>

<p>'Kate is a bluff; you mustn't take any notice of what she
says. You accept a friend's advice, and go very carefully to
work. I am not so sure that you didn't behave indiscreetly this
afternoon.'</p>

<p>'That is impossible!' said Michael stoutly, and T.B. Smith
laughed.</p>

<p>'The thing to have done was not to have recognized her, and
to have kept her under observation, pursuing your inquiries in
the usual way.'</p>

<p>'If you can suggest any method by which I could have
prevented her from recognizing me, and recognizing the fact that
I recognized her, I will admit that I was wrong,' and T.B. Smith
agreed.</p>

<p>'You may be right,' he said; 'any way, look after
yourself.'</p>

<p>Michael promptly forgot his chief's advice, and spent his
evening making a solitary reconnaissance of Crime Street. Crime
Street does not appear upon any plan of London, but if you will
look at any large survey of the Hampstead district, you will
find in a somewhat irregular tangle of buildings within a
stone's throw of the Heath, a curious oval which is conspicuous
on the plan, not only by its own symmetry but by the graceful
lines of the thoroughfares which radiate therefrom.</p>

<p>This is Amberscombe Gardens. The centre of the oval is
occupied by four houses&mdash;Numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8; the
northern side of the gardens by five houses&mdash;Numbers 1,
3, 5, 7 and 9. Into Amberscombe Gardens from the north run three
roads, the first of which (opening into the oval between Numbers
1 and 3) is called The Approach; the second, dividing Numbers 5
and 7, called Bethburn Avenue; the third, between Numbers 7 and
9, Coleburn Avenue. On the south side of the oval the
arrangement of the streets is very similar. Originally the
central space had been occupied by nine houses, but these had
been pulled down by the proprietors of the remaining four, and a
private garden, common to all four houses, had been laid out by
the owners of these properties. So that on the southern side of
the central oval there were no buildings but a wall bisected at
regular intervals by plain garden doors which form such a common
feature of London suburban residences.</p>

<p>In reality, the roadway to the north and south of the plot is
all Amberscombe Gardens, but the oval which curves round to the
north was at the period this story covers known to the police as
'Crime Street,' and in his description the nine houses on both
sides of the northern curve were involved.</p>

<p>Number 1, the most modest of all the buildings, was in the
occupation of Dr. Philip Garon, an American practitioner who
made frequent visits across the Atlantic and invariably returned
to deposit a very handsome surplus in the local branch of the
London and Western Counties Bank. Dr. Garon was successful as a
result of the sublime assurance of every ocean-going passenger,
that the notice, conspicuously displayed in the smoking-room
warning passengers not to play cards with strangers, did not
apply to him.</p>

<p>Number 3, a pretty house smothered in clematis in the proper
season of the year, with its white window sashes and its sober
red front, was the town house of Mr. Cunningham, who,
apparently, had no initial and no Christian name. He was known
to his intimate friends as Mush, the derivation of which is a
little obscure. Mr. Cunningham described himself as
'Independent,' which meant no more than that he was independent
of the ordinary necessities of making an honest living. In a
sense, he was by far the best known of the colony, for Mush had
served two terms of penal servitude, one in an English and one
in a French prison. He had the reputation of being able to cut
holes in steel safes with a greater rapidity than any other
gentleman in his profession, and it is said, probably with
truth, that he had improved upon the oxyhydrogen jet and had
introduced a new element which shortened the work by half.</p>

<p>The tenant of Number 5 was a gentleman, benign of
countenance, and very good to the poor. He was called the Bishop
by friends and foes alike. His real name was Brown, and he had
been concerned in more bank swindles than any of the other
colonists, though he had only one conviction to his discredit,
and that a comparative fleabite of nine months hard labour.</p>

<p>The owner of Number 7 was described as 'Mr. Colling Jacques,
Civil Engineer,' in the local directories. The 'official' police
Who's Who noted that he was a wonderful pistol shot, and
recorded, in parenthesis, that on the occasion of his arrest in
connection with the smashing of the Bank of Holland, no weapon
was found upon him. It was also added that there was no
conviction against him in England, though he, too, had seen the
inside of a French prison.</p>

<p>Number 9 was pointed out to sight-seers with a certain amount
of local pride by the guide, as the home of Millet the forger,
who had received on one occasion a fifteen years' sentence, but
had been released after serving two years; an act of grace on
the part of the authorities which earned for him a certain
unpopularity with his peers, and was held to be not unconnected
with the subsequent arrest of a few of his former associates;
the suggestion being that Mr. Millet had turned King's
evidence.</p>

<p>At Number 2 on the 'oval' side of the street, lived H.
Mulberry, a respectable and methodical man, who went to his
little office in Chancery Lane every morning of his life by the
9.15 a.m. and returned to his home at exactly 5.30 p.m. year in
and year out. Mulberry was a begging letter writer on a
magnificent scale. He had a wonderful literary style which
seldom failed to extract the necessary emolument which he
sought.</p>

<p>Number 4, a much larger house, indeed the second largest in
Crime Street, was the habitat of 'Senor Gregori, a teacher of
languages.' Unfortunately for him, he had in the course of his
thrilling career taught other things than the liquid tongue of
Spain. For example, he had taught the Bank of Chile that their
'unforgeable' notes, which, it was boasted, defied photographic
reproduction, could be turned out by the tens of thousands, and
that the six tints in which a gold bond was printed, offered no
insuperable difficulty to a clever craftsman with an artist's
eye and a sense of colour.</p>

<p>In Number 8 lived the two brothers Thomas and Francis
Stockmar, of Austrian extraction, who were described as
political refugees, but were undoubtedly criminals of a
peculiarly dangerous type. The Stockmars were dour, white-faced
men with short bristling hair and were certainly the least
presentable of all the colonists.</p>

<p>Number 6 has been left to the last, for this was the most
important house in Crime Street. It was a storey higher than any
other, built squarely with no attempt at beauty. It is said that
the third floor consisted of one room, and that from its many
windows it was possible to command not only all the approaches
to the northern side of the gardens, but those to the south; it
has even been suggested that it was so planned, that in case of
necessity the house could be converted into a fortress, from the
third floor of which a last desperate stand might be made. This,
then, was Number 6, the abiding-place of Colonel Westhanger and
his brilliant niece.</p>

<p>Michael Pretherston was no stranger to Crime Street. He had
made many visits to this locality, and it was at his initiative
that the roadway of Amberscombe Gardens had been dug up one fine
morning by a gang of road-breakers, and there had been revealed
that remarkable subterranean passage which connected the one
side of the street with the other. The passage-way led from the
summer-house in the gardens of the oval to a stable in Number
3.</p>

<p>The colonists, however, swore stoutly that they knew nothing
whatever of the existence of this passage, and that it must have
existed years before they came to the street. The civil
engineer, Colling Jacques, pointed out to the district surveyor
that the very character of the passage suggested that this was
some storm-water drain which had been laid down and forgotten by
the contractor. Or else it had been laid down in error and the
contractor had been either too lazy, or too rushed, to break it
up, There were many other explanations, none of which were
wholly acceptable.</p>

<p>Michael, swinging his stick, passed that portion of the road
in which the passage had run and wondered with a reminiscent
smile where the new tunnel was, for that there was a new one he
did not doubt.</p>

<p>Night was falling and Dr. Philip Garon's dining-room widows
blazed with light. Mr. Mulberry's on the right was more modestly
illuminated. Mr. Cunningham's house was in darkness, as also was
'The Bishop's. There were lights in the bedroom at Number 7, but
Number 6 was black, as also was Number 8.</p>

<p>He saw Millet, who was smoking, standing at his garden gate,
and crossed the road toward him, realizing that the keen-eyed
gentleman had already observed his presence. Millet, a florid
man with a genial, almost fulsome manner, met him with a
friendly nod.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Mr. Pretherston,' he said. 'I hope you are not
looking for trouble.'</p>

<p>Michael leant on the top bar of the gate and shook his head.
'I shouldn't come here for trouble,' he said. 'This is the most
law-abiding spot in London.'</p>

<p>Mr. Millet sighed, and murmured something about misfortunes
which overtake mankind, and added a pious expression of his
desire to forget the past and to end his days in that security
and peace which sin denies its votaries.</p>

<p>'Very pretty,' said Michael blandly; 'and how are all our
good neighbours? I was thinking of taking a house here myself.
By the way,' he added innocently, 'I suppose you don't know any
that are to let?'</p>

<p>Mr. Millet shook his head.</p>

<p>'I am all alone here,' he said. 'If you were really serious
about wishing to live in this neighbourhood, you could have a
couple of rooms in my house. I should be honoured to act as your
host, Mr. Pretherston.'</p>

<p>'And how is Kate?' demanded Michael, ignoring the
invitation.</p>

<p>'Kate?' asked the puzzled Mr. Millet. 'Oh, you mean Miss
Westhanger. I haven't seen her for several days&mdash;I think
it was last Tuesday afternoon I saw her last.'</p>

<p>'Yes, at 2.30&mdash;in the afternoon,' mocked Michael. 'She
was wearing a blue dress with white spots, and a green hat with
an ostrich feather. You remember her distinctly because she
dropped her bag and you crossed to pick it up. You needn't start
the alibi factory working, Millet; I have nothing against Kate
for the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Millet laughed softly.</p>

<p>'You will have your joke,' he said.</p>

<p>'I will,' said Michael with grim emphasis, 'but it is going
to be a long time developing. I haven't seen the Stockmars
lately either.'</p>

<p>'I never see them at all,' Mr. Millet hastened to state. 'I
have very little in common with foreigners. Whatever there is
against me, Mr. Pretherston, I am a patriot through and through.
I am proud to be English, and I don't take kindly to foreign
gentlemen, and never will.'</p>

<p>'Your patriotism does you credit, Millet,' said the detective
drily, as he prepared to move on. 'I wish you would be patriotic
enough to give me a tip as to what game is on.' He lowered his
voice. 'You know all that is happening here, and you might do
yourself a little bit of good.'</p>

<p>'If I knew anything,' said the other earnestly, 'I would tell
you in a moment, Mr. Pretherston; but here I am out of the
world, so to speak. Nobody ever consults me, and I am glad they
don't. I want to be left alone to forget the past&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Cut all that little Eva stuff out, Uncle Tom,' said Michael
coarsely.</p>

<p>Other eyes had watched Michael, from behind blinds, through
unsuspected peep-holes; a dozen pairs of eyes had followed him
as he took his slow promenade along Crime Street.</p>

<p>Colonel Westhanger, a tall grey man, stood in that big room
on the third floor of his house, his hands folded behind him,
his chin upon his breast, following every movement of the
detective. Gregori, handsome and lithe, stood at his elbow,
shading the glow of his cigarette in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>'Colonel mio,' he said softly, 'I would give much for an
opportunity of meeting that gentleman in a nice dark passage, in
one of those old Harrison Ainsworth houses which were so
providentially built over a river.'</p>

<p>'You will have your wish one of these days,' said the Colonel
gruffly. 'I don't like that fellow. He is not one of the
ordinary run of policemen. They are bad enough, but this fellow
knows too much.'</p>

<p>He nibbled his white moustache, shook his head and turned
away from the window as Michael took his farewell of the
forger.</p>

<p>'Watch him on the other side,' he said, 'and send one of the
boys out to follow him.' He descended the thickly carpeted
stairs to the first floor, which was the living-suite. The
drawing-room into which he turned was a beautifully furnished
apartment, and the girl who had been sitting at the piano, her
nimble hands running over the keys, looked up as he
appeared.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="first">'WHERE did he go?' she asked.</p>

<p>'He went to Millet,' said the Colonel, throwing himself down
to a divan and biting off the end of a fresh cigar. 'I wonder
what the dickens he wants?' he mused.</p>

<p>Kate Westhanger made a little grimace.</p>

<p>'You can never tell whether a policeman finds his duty a
pleasure, or his pleasure a duty,' she said. 'I suppose he is
just renewing acquaintance with Crime Street.'</p>

<p>'Don't use that phrase,' snapped her uncle.</p>

<p>'I shall use whatever phrase I wish,' she said calmly. 'You
are getting nervous. Why?'</p>

<p>'I'm not nervous,' he protested loudly. 'I am getting old, I
suppose, and the job is such a big one. It is almost too big for
me, and if I occupied the position I had a few years ago, Kate,
I would drop it. After all, we have made a good deal of money,
and we might as well all of us live to enjoy it.'</p>

<p>She was back at the piano again, and was playing with the
soft pedal down.</p>

<p>'Can't you find anything more cheerful than the &ldquo;Death
of Asa&rdquo;?' growled her relative. 'It is nerves, of course;
I am awfully sorry.'</p>

<p>She got up and closed the piano with a bang which made him
jump.</p>

<p>'I don't know what to do about Mike,' she mused.</p>

<p>'Gregori has a solution,' said the Colonel.</p>

<p>'To cut his throat, I suppose,' said the girl coolly.
'Gregori is so elemental and so horrific! I can't imagine that
he ever has cut a throat in his life. But I suppose he feels
that it is in keeping with his sunny southern nature to talk
like that. No, Colonel mio,' she mimicked, 'we have stopped
short of murder so far, and I think we will remain on the safe
side. My theory coincides with Mike's. I was reading an article
of his in a Socialistic paper the other day, and it was all
about the Right to Live. I don't believe in killing people. I
believe in bleeding those who have grown apoplectic with their
money, and I don't even know whether I believe in that.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean'?' The Colonel looked up at her under his
shaggy brows. She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>'I mean,' she said slowly, 'I never know whether my views are
my own views, or whether they are just your views, which I
reflect like a mirror. You see, dear,' she said, 'I am very
young, but I have a logical mind, and my logical mind tells me
that no girl can have any very definite views at nineteen
&mdash;not of her own, I mean. Perhaps when I am twenty-five I
shall look upon you as a terrible person, and all this'&mdash;
she spread her hands out&mdash;'as something to think of with
a shudder.'</p>

<p>'In the meantime,' said her uncle practically, 'you are Miss
Ali Baba, chief strategist of our little army and a very exigent
young lady&mdash;by the way, Gregori is kicking.'</p>

<p>She looked at him with a contemptuous little twist of her
lips.</p>

<p>'There is a great centre forward lost in Gregori,' she said.
'What has moved that dago's feet?'</p>

<p>'Hush, hush, my child,' cautioned her uncle. 'Our admirable
friend is upstairs, and anyway, it doesn't do to speak
disrespectfully of one's criminal associates. There is a certain
punctilio in our profession which you may have noticed.'</p>

<p>'How queer it sounds,' she said, leaning forward and clasping
her knee. 'Do you know, uncle, I cannot think straight. Ever
since I was so high'&mdash;she stretched her hand out before
her&mdash;'I have never known a desire to secure anything I
wanted, save by taking it from somebody else. At the school in
Lausanne before I came back to Ireland I seemed to be amongst
the queerest people, and, honestly, although you had warned me,
I thought they were all mad. All their fathers made money in
business, which seems to be a slow method of stealing allowed by
the law. Think of the horrible monotony of working steadily day
after day without any holidays, with no excitement, no
adventures, save the artificial thrill of a theatre and the
adventures that meet you on your way home.'</p>

<p>'I didn't even know there were those kind of adventures,'
said the Colonel, fingering his trim moustache, and enjoying
with closed eyes the fragrance of his cigar.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' nodded the girl, 'you meet all sorts of men who
raise their hats and say &ldquo;Good evening, miss,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Haven't we met before?&rdquo; I don't think they have
ever said anything else,' she reflected thoughtfully; 'they all
belong to the &ldquo;Good evening&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Met you
before&rdquo; school, and they all want to know if you are
&ldquo;going their way.&rdquo;'</p>

<p>'What happens then?' asked the amused Colonel, carefully
removing his cigar in order that he might laugh without
detriment to the accumulating ash.</p>

<p>'I have only had one experience,' said Kate. 'It was with a
young man with a horribly weak chin. He had studied in both
schools, for his &ldquo;Good evening&rdquo; was followed by a
request for information upon my immediate plans, and I let him
walk with me. I expected something very dreadful, but he talked
mostly about his mother, and the difficulties he had about
getting a latchkey. He wanted to take my arm, but I told him it
wasn't done, and then he suggested that I should meet him on
Sunday. By this time I had learnt all about his family, his
mother, and the girl he was prepared to sacrifice to retain a
continuation of our intimacy. I also discovered his name was
Ernest, and that he was the cleverest man in his office.'</p>

<p>'He wanted to kiss you, I'll be bound,' said the Colonel.</p>

<p>'I think he did,' admitted the girl, 'but he didn't say so.
All he said was that he hoped it wouldn't rain, and asked if he
might write to me. I told him he might, but, unfortunately, he
forgot to ask me my address&mdash;</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly. 'What is Gregori kicking about?'</p>

<p>'That Madrid affair didn't go off as well as it might have
gone,' said the Colonel, avoiding her eye.</p>

<p>She nodded. 'I know; and Gregori blames me, I presume.'</p>

<p>'Gregori never blames you,' said the Colonel. 'I think
Gregori would knife anybody who said a word against you.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, nodding her head, her eyes fixed on the
opposite wall. 'The Madrid affair went badly, in spite of the
fact that there were forty-two sheets of manuscript, in Spanish
and English, giving the most elaborate directions. It was a
month's work for me, and it was all wasted, with the greater
part of a hundred thousand pesetas, because Gregori's trusted
Senor Rahboulla thought he could improve upon my instructions,
and joined the train at Cordova in a light grey suit when I told
him to wear the conventional black of the madrilleno and
insisted upon his making his entrance to Madrid from Toledo. I
knew that Cordova was watched by the French and Spanish police,
and I knew too that they would be looking for a stranger.
Rahboulla advertised himself, was arrested, and the chain which
I had carefully pieced together was broken. By the time he had
shaken off the police and arrived in Madrid the closing hour of
the Prado had been advanced from six to five, and the
consequence is that the Velasquez is still in the picture
gallery and we are a hundred thousand pesetas the poorer.'</p>

<p>The Colonel shook his head. 'You are a wonderful girl and I
will admit you are right. Heavens! the patience required to work
out these details!'</p>

<p>'The ideal criminal is a strategist,' said the girl. 'He
foresees every move of the enemy and forestalls him. He makes a
diversion at one point and his real attack at another. He
prepares the way for retreat at the same time as he is preparing
his advance. It took me six months to obtain all the information
I wanted, and it took six minutes for Rahboulla to upset our
plans.' She laughed. 'If things go wrong, you blame the
General,' she said. 'Two years ago, Gregori the Kicker
introduced an Italian into one of our schemes&mdash;the
business of the Nottingham Post Office. That went wrong
too.'</p>

<p>'There I admit you were right,' the Colonel hurried to say.
'Tolmini made a mess of it.'</p>

<p>'And tried to drag us all into it when he was caught,' said
the girl. 'He went to prison under the impression that I had led
him into a trap&mdash;though the fool was told the mail bags
were not to be touched until the night shift came on duty.'</p>

<p>'Why do you mention him now with such emphasis?' asked the
Colonel curiously.</p>

<p>'Because he's out of prison&mdash;and he'll be kicking
too,' she replied, 'just as Gregori kicks!'</p>

<p>'Let the dead bury the dead,' quoted the Colonel. 'And how's
the new scheme?'</p>

<p>'Much further advanced than you think. There are still one or
two roads to be made smooth, one or two outposts to be rushed,
some barbed wire to be cut.'</p>

<p>'By Gad!' cried the Colonel admiringly, 'you ought to have
been a soldier, Kate.'</p>

<p>She leant back in the chair with her hands clasped behind her
head and looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>'You were once a gentleman, uncle,' she said in that direct
way of hers, and Colonel Westhanger flushed and frowned.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear uncle,' she expostulated, 'you are not a
gentleman by the ordinary code now, are you?'</p>

<p>'I have certain instincts,' protested the Colonel gruffly.
'Hang it all, Kate, you don't let a fellow down very
lightly.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you are still something of a gentleman,' said the
girl reflectively. 'The mere fact that you are annoyed at the
suggestion that you are not, proves that. But what I mean to say
is this: there was a time when you obeyed another code, when you
thought stealing was a disgraceful thing and robbery under arms
a crime. You must have associated with men on whose word you
could rely and who would never commit a dishonest or a mean
action&mdash;men who were prepared in battle to give their
lives for you. And you must have commanded men who had the same
views and have punished soldiers who stepped aside from the
straight path and committed little crimes which, compared with
yours, were as pins' heads to the dome of St. Paul's.'</p>

<p>'I can't see why you want to talk about the past,' said the
Colonel irritably. He was still a fine figure of a man, grey
moustached, broad of shoulder, tall and straight of back, and
had about him that indefinable something which men who have
commanded men never entirely lose.</p>

<p>'I am merely comparing you with me,' she said. 'You have the
advantage of having seen both sides. Tell me, which is the
better?'</p>

<p>'Which do you think?' he demanded suspiciously. She tossed
her cigarette into the grate.</p>

<p>'I think this is the better,' she said frankly. 'It is very
pleasant and very exciting. And all the good people I have met
have been very dull. I think that is because all good people are
dull.'</p>

<p>'There are some good people,' said the Colonel virtuously,
'who are very interesting.'</p>

<p>'Not because of their goodness,' rejoined the girl quickly.
'If you meet a very popular good man it is because there is
something about him which is not absolutely good. If you hear a
man speak of a parson as a good fellow, you will generally
discover that be goes to the National Sporting Club and sees
boxing or rides to hounds or does something which is quite
unassociated with his professional duties or the exercise of his
innocent qualities. But you have not answered me. Which is
better?'</p>

<p>'If I had my life to live over again ...' began the
Colonel with a wry face.</p>

<p>'That's silly,' said the girl calmly. 'You won't have your
life to live over again, so why speculate upon the possibility?
Anyway, if you could live your life over again, you could not
possibly benefit by your present experience, because you would
not remember it. You have lived two lives; which is the
better?'</p>

<p>'You are in a queer mood tonight,' said Colonel Westhanger,
rising and stalking past her to the fireplace. 'Have you got
religion, or something?'</p>

<p>'Which is the better?' she asked again&mdash;'to be a free
thief, or to be in the dull bondage of honesty?'</p>

<p>'For your peace of mind the honest life is the better,' said
the Colonel. 'You have no sleepless nights, no agony of mind
which it is necessary to conceal with whatever skill you possess
at every knock at the door, no fear of the police, no wondering
what the next day is going to bring forth.'</p>

<p>'Really!' She looked up at him quizzically. 'Do honest men
never have any of those experiences? Do honest men get into
debt, for example, and dread the coming of the collector? Does
an honest man, who is getting grey, feel a little sickening
sensation in his heart every time his employer looks at him
thoughtfully?'</p>

<p>The Colonel turned round and snarled over his shoulder. 'As
you seem to have all your answers ready-made, I don't know why
you trouble to ask me,' he snapped. 'There are advantages and
disadvantages on both sides of the picture.'</p>

<p>The girl was in a restless mood, and presently she sprang up,
walked to the little window, opened the little square of shutter
and looked out into the darkening street. Then she crossed to
her little desk at one side of the fireplace. She sat down and
wrote for a while, then as suddenly she dropped her pen and got
up again.</p>

<p>'You are going to ask another question,' warned the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Only one,' she pleaded.</p>

<p>'Well, fire away,' he grumbled ungraciously.</p>

<p>'What would induce you to forsake your career and apply your
undoubted talents, as the assize judge said to poor dear Mr.
Mulberry, to better purpose?'</p>

<p>'Wealth,' said the Colonel promptly; 'enough stuff put aside
to bring me in a nice little income. And here again, let me say,
Kate, that you and I could well afford to knock off&mdash;'</p>

<p>She interrupted him. 'That is a purely material inducement,'
she said. 'What other&mdash;spiritual or ethical?'</p>

<p>'Oh, rot!' he snapped; 'why do you ask these fool
questions?'</p>

<p>'Because I am wondering,' she said, 'what influence could be
brought to bear upon me. The opinion of my fellow-creatures? No,
I don't care what they think. I know they are mostly fools, and
so why should they influence me? Wealth? No, if I were as rich
as Croesus I should go on for the sport of it. Punishment? No, I
should use my spare time in correcting the faults in me which
had resulted in my detection. I am afraid I am incorrigible,
uncle, for there is something about this life which appeals to
me no end&mdash;and now I am going to dress,' she said, making
for the door.</p>

<p>'Going out?' asked the Colonel in surprise.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'But Gregori&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Gregori can wait,' said Kate, 'and Gregori bores me. He is
always trying to make love.'</p>

<p>'Is that remarkable?' suggested the Colonel archly.</p>

<p>'It is remarkably annoying,' said the girl.</p>

<p>She flung open the door and stepped back. Gregori, politest
of cavaliers, stood deferentially in the entrance, and she
surveyed him coolly.</p>

<p>'Were you listening?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Señorita!' he said, shocked.</p>

<p>She laughed, and passed out.</p>

<p>Gregori watched her as she mounted the stairs till she turned
out of sight, then he closed the door and came across to the
Colonel.</p>

<p>'Our little friend is hard on me,' he said, but with no hint
of malice in his voice.</p>

<p>'She is a queer girl, Gregori,' replied the Colonel, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>'She is a queer girl,' repeated Gregori&mdash;'queer
indeed, yes.' He stroked his little black moustache. 'She
doesn't like me.'</p>

<p>'Whom does she like?' snapped the older man.</p>

<p>'You, I trust,' smiled the Spaniard.</p>

<p>The Colonel tossed his head despairingly. 'I hardly know,' he
said. 'What a reversal of positions!'</p>

<p>The Spaniard took the seat the girl had vacated.</p>

<p>'I know what you are thinking about,' he nodded. 'A few years
ago she was the obedient child absorbing our code&mdash;today,
the is the tyrannical mistress of the situation.' He deftly
unrolled and rolled a Spanish cigarette, licked its edges and
fumbled for a match in his waistcoat pocket. 'She is all brain,
our Kate,' he said admiringly; 'but her heart,&mdash;pouf!' He
puffed out a cloud of smoke to emphasize the word.</p>

<p>'There is no end to her energy,' he went on. 'Sometimes I
think she is dangerous, and then when I come to consider all
things it is impossible to say that she can be. After all, hers
is only the plan. The responsibility for the bungling is with us
&mdash;the plan is so perfect that you can hardly pick a hole
in it. She works out to the last minute detail the chronology of
a coup; she dresses it, rehearses it. She never fails. Yes, it
was Rahboulla,' he agreed, 'and I was wrong to kick. What was it
she called me?'&mdash;a &ldquo;centre forward&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;dago.&rdquo;' He laughed softly.</p>

<p>'She is very young,' said the Colonel apologetically, 'and a
little impetuous of speech; she talks too much, I think.'</p>

<p>'A pretty woman can never talk too much,' said the gallant
Gregori; 'she can think too much and talk too little. A person
who talks is like a lighted house with all the blinds up and the
doors open, you know where you are. Now, Colonel mio, how far
have we got with this new scheme?'</p>

<p>The Colonel brought a chair in one hand, and a light table in
the other, to where the Spaniard sat, produced from his
inside-pocket a bunch of memoranda, and in a few minutes the men
were deep in the discussion of the most remarkable, the most
startling and the most daring enterprise Crime Street had ever
undertaken.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="first">SEBO'S CLUB was crowded, for it was the dinner
hour and Sebo's is the most extensively patronized of the dining
clubs. Here, all that was beautiful, all that was smart, all
that was famous and brilliant in the world of society, letters
and the drama met on common ground&mdash;the inherent and
universal desire which humanity had for careless comfort. A
Cabinet Minister and his party sat at the next table to that
presided over by a great revue actress; the owner of a Derby
winner sat back to back against a famous Radical satirist. The
editor of a great London daily could look across his table, and,
without shifting his eyes, could count in his field of vision
the pretty dancer from the Empire-drome, a royal physician, a
peer of the realm and a ragtime singer.</p>

<p>The big dining-hall blazed with lights; the little tables
were crowded together so as scarcely to leave room for the
waiters, who, by some mysterious dispensation of Providence,
seemed able to thread their ways through impossible spaces. The
noisy coon band kept up its rhythmic pandemonium in one corner
of the room, but did not drown the rippling laughter and the
buzz of light-hearted talk. In the little vestibule, a young
man, very tall and very thin, paced the tessellated floor with
that evidence of resignation&mdash;which tells so eloquently the
story of the Unpunctual Guest. He was very fair, and very pink.
His countenance was vacant, and the vacancy was by no means
relieved when he screwed a gold-rimmed monocle into his right
eye.</p>

<p>Presently the glass doors swung and a girl came hurriedly
toward him, holding out her gloved hand.</p>

<p>'I am awfully sorry I am late, Reggie,' she said with easy
familiarity.</p>

<p>'If you were an hour late, or five hours late, or a day
late,' said the young man with gentle ecstasy, 'I should be
content to wait, Miss Flemming.'</p>

<p>She flashed a dazzling smile at him.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't be horribly shocked if you called me Vera,' she
said. The young man went pinker than ever, coughed, stuttered,
ran his gloved finger inside the high-upstanding collar about
his thin throat, dropped his eyeglass, retrieved it, and did all
this in the space of four seconds, thereby betraying his
perturbation and his gratitude.</p>

<p>'You have a table, I suppose,' said the girl when she had
returned from depositing her coat.</p>

<p>'Rather!' said the young man, and added after a second's
thought, 'rather!'</p>

<p>He fussily shepherded her through the mass of tables, for his
own attenuation enabled him to emulate the deeds of the agile
serving-man, and brought her to a corner table which was
smothered with rare flowers. Heads were turned, sharp eyes
focused the couple, some smiled, though for the girl the glances
held nothing but admiration or cold-blooded appraisement,
according to the sex of the observer.</p>

<p>'Reggie Boltover,' said one young man.</p>

<p>'Who is Reggie Boltover?' asked his companion.</p>

<p>'A human being loosely attached to a million,' was the
laconic description.</p>

<p>The girl was radiant, the smile hardly left her face, and the
eyes which glanced shyly up to her tall companion were full of
wonder and delight.</p>

<p>'So this is Sebo's,' she said; 'isn't it a dreadfully wicked
place?'</p>

<p>Reggie Boltover's face creased alarmingly&mdash;he, too,
was smiling.</p>

<p>'My dear Miss&mdash;my dear Vera,' he said boldly, 'should
I bring you to a wicked place? Now I ask you, should I bring you
to a wicked place, should I?'</p>

<p>His conversational powers were not brilliant, but his heart
was pure. He was not really a wicked young man about town, and
his chief wickedness lay in his implicit belief that he was. He
had met the girl one night by accident. A more daring friend of
his, and nearer approaching Reggie's own ideal of doggishness,
had induced him (he protesting feebly) to call at a stage door
where he was meeting a charming friend to take her to supper.
The charming friend, in the generous large-hearted way of
chorus-girls, had introduced her friend, Vera Flemming, a
new-comer to the ranks of the chorus, and they had all supped
together, and Vera had been very charming to Mr. Reggie
Boltover, and he had asked her to go with him up the river, and
had serious thoughts, because of her evident refinement, of
introducing her to his mother, which shows that Reggie had
reached the most dangerous stage of infatuation.</p>

<p>There was really nothing wrong about Reggie Boltover, and
nothing remarkably terrible about this strangely initiated
friendship. Chorus-girls are merely shop-girls with a taste for
caviar and peaches. They are no more sinful than their sisters
in the same social strata, and the only difference between them
is that, whilst they are exposed to similar temptations, the
chorus-girl has a larger field to pick from, and the candidates
are much more presentable. A shop-girl accepts the hospitality
of a tea-shop, the chorus-girl goes to the Fritz. Both have one
consuming passion, a desire for good food for which they do not
have to pay.</p>

<p>Reggie Boltover, who, to do him justice, knew everybody,
entertained the girl for half an hour by pointing out the
various celebrities in the room, and Vera Flemming was
interested without being enthusiastically so.</p>

<p>'I would rather you talked about yourself,' she said. 'You
are ever so much more interesting than these people.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' said Reggie, with a little giggle; 'oh, no!'</p>

<p>'You are, indeed, you are,' she said earnestly.</p>

<p>'Oh, come,' said Reggie, 'oh, come! no! I am not interesting,
oh, dear no!'</p>

<p>His life, he admitted frankly, was very ordinary. All that he
did was to sign a few cheques, liquidate a few debts, see a few
'fellows' about 'things,' and 'there you are,' said Reggie.</p>

<p>'It must be wonderful to be in a position of power,' said the
girl musingly. 'Of course, I come from a very poor family. We
only think in shillings, where you think in thousands of pounds.
And it is awfully hard to realize what it feels like to order
people to do things, instead of being ordered.'</p>

<p>Reggie Boltover, who had never ordered anybody to do anything
in his life, and would not have dared to dispute the judgment of
the innumerable managers and directors whom his sainted father
had appointed in his lifetime, wondered himself what it felt
like. He had often meditated, with a shudder, upon necessity,
which might one day arise, for his taking the initiative in the
conduct of his business. He dimly realized that in time, all his
managers and directors would die, and he had dimly speculated
upon the question as to who would replace them. He had a feeling
that perhaps one might go to Whiteleys and order some new ones,
but it had never occurred to him that at his autocratic word
managers and people of that description could be made out of
mud, or that an order affecting the business which he was
supposed to control, would be acted upon if he were to give that
order.</p>

<p>'Well, you know,' he said, 'I never really tell people to do
anything. You see, I never see them except very occasionally. Of
course, they make reports, and all that sort of thing, and I
have a man who reads them, so everything is all right, and I
just sign cheques and see a few fellows, and there you are.'</p>

<p>Under the genial influence of her sympathetic interest he
expanded a little, and proved that he was not as wholly
incompetent as he pretended to be. For instance, he knew that
the iron works and shipbuilding yard which still bore his
father's name, and incidentally his own, made 'a deuced lot of
money' every year, and that certain other properties made no
money.</p>

<p>There was one property of which he spoke with great
bitterness, but only because his father, in his lifetime, had
also spoken of that matter with similar violence and asperity.
Apparently, the one redeeming feature about Boltover's Cement
Works lay in the fact that it had no manager and therefore
produced no reports. It was, in fact, a deserted shell of a
building, so infamously unprofitable that Boltover senior (now
in heaven) had directed almost with his last breath, if you
believed Reggie, that his name should be erased from the
official designation of the company.</p>

<p>'You see, it was bad cement. You know how cement is made,
don't you?'</p>

<p>'I should love to,' said the girl, her eyes shining. 'I have
often wondered.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Reggie, looking round the table for something to
illustrate the object lesson, 'You dig in the river, and you
take out a lot of stuff, and you chuck it in a cart, and then
you chuck it into a fire, and you pull it out and do something
to it, and there you are! That's cement. Only our cement wasn't
cement, if you understand. That is what made the beastly thing
so awkward.'</p>

<p>'How wonderful!' said the girl; 'I shall always remember
that.'</p>

<p>'Of course, we've got our eyes open,' said Reggie, now fairly
launched upon the story of his life, 'and one of these days we
shall catch a mug.'</p>

<p>'Catch a&mdash;?' asked the girl, puzzled.</p>

<p>Reggie went very pink, but he was excited and grateful at
this demonstration of the girl's refinement. 'Forgive the
vulgarity, Miss&mdash;Vera; I mean we shall find a purchaser.
I once nearly sold the beastly thing for £10,000, and the day
the deed was to be signed, they took the poor chap away to a
lunatic asylum. Poor old bird, not right in his bead, you know.
That is why he wanted to buy our cement works. Comic, wasn't it?
D'you know,' said Mr. Boltover suddenly, 'when I came round to
the stage door that night, I never expected to meet you?'</p>

<p>She looked at him in innocent surprise. 'Didn't you really?'
she said incredulously, as though the idea had occurred to her
for the first time, and then, thoughtfully, 'I suppose you
didn't.'</p>

<p>'I didn't expect to meet you,' repeated Mr. Boltover, who,
when he had got hold of one complete sentence, held tight to it
until his groping mentality had reached out and securely grasped
another. 'No, I didn't expect to meet you, but I'm awfully glad.
I feel I owe that young lady more than I can ever repay.'</p>

<p>He said this with an unusual display of sentimentality. 'That
young lady,' was his companion's chorus-girl friend, who at that
moment was retailing to her youthful companion at the far side
of the room such details of Vera's life as she had been able to
secure in a seven-day acquaintance.</p>

<p>'Vera's not in our show now, of course,' she said. 'I don't
think she had ever been on the stage before. She's an awfully
fresh kid. Came late to rehearsals, and all that sort of thing,
but I like her immensely.'</p>

<p>She smiled and bowed to Vera, who, at that moment had caught
her eye.</p>

<p>'She's very pretty,' said her companion.</p>

<p>'Yes, isn't she?' agreed the girl, her interest in her friend
suddenly evaporating. But there was one in that crowded
dining-room whose every disengaged moment was employed in
watching the girl and her companion. It involved his getting into
the way of other waiters, and called down upon his head
execrations in Neapolitan, Sicilian, and the choicest slang of
the Montmartre. He was a man who had prayed for two years for
such a moment as this, and his soul rejected in savage exaltation
that so Heaven-sent an opportunity had come.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, his plan took a definite shape. For the
consequence he cared nothing. Here was his opportunity, here was
his enemy. He seized a moment, slipped through the service door
and passed down a flight of stone steps to the crowded kitchen
filled at that moment with a babble of sound as the orders were
repeated across the steaming brass pots and the blistering hot
plates. He passed through the kitchen to the larder department,
and found what he sought in the big cool vault where the
butchers worked. It was a long thin knife. He waited until the
butcher's back was turned and slipped it up his sleeve, passed
rapidly through the kitchen, ignoring the chef's demand as to
his business, and reached the warm bright restaurant again.</p>

<p>He had no time to waste.</p>

<p>The butcher might at any moment detect the theft, and the
thief be hauled into the service-room to explain his conduct. He
made his way across the room to where Mr. Reginald Boltover and
his fair companion sat.</p>

<p>Reggie thought the man had a message, but Vera, looking up,
saw the man's evil face&mdash;and knew. She half twisted, half
flung herself against Reginald Boltover as the waiter's hand
came up to strike. She saw the knife glitter for a space of a
second, and closed her eyes. Then there was the sound of a
struggle, and she opened them in time to see the vengeful man
flung backward to the floor, and an immaculate Michael
Pretherston standing over him examining the knife with some
interest. She met the inspector's eye and smiled, though the
smile was forced, for even as he bowed, she heard the mockery of
his surprise.</p>

<p>'Why, Kate!' he murmured, 'I'm always meeting you.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="first">'AT 9.40 on the night of the 15th instant I was
present at Sebo's Club. The room was full of diners, and amongst
them was Mr. Reginald Boltover and a girl giving the name of
Miss Vera Flemming, who was in reality Kate Westhanger. At 9.52
an Italian named Emil Tolmini, employed as waiter at Sebo's
Club, attempted to stab Kate Westhanger, but was prevented and
taken into custody. In the course of the struggle, in which he
was disarmed, he sustained a scalp wound, and permission was
given for him to be taken to the kitchen to have the wound
dressed. I regret to state that he succeeded in making his
escape. He is a convict on licence (record No. P.C.A./C.C.C.
85943). He is an old associate of the Crime Street gang, and was
obviously attempting to avenge himself upon the girl for some
injury, real or imaginary, which he had suffered.</p>

<p>'I made no attempt to warn Mr. Boltover as to the character
of his companion, but subsequently calling at his flat in
Piccadilly on the pretence that I wished to get information
about the attempted murder, I discovered that he had been
introduced to the girl at a theatre where she was posing as a
chorus-girl. She had evidently laid a deep plan to meet him, for
what reason it is not clear. He is a very wealthy man, and it
may be necessary at a later stage to warn him; but at present I
have taken upon myself the responsibility of refraining from
that act.'</p>

<p>Michael Pretherston ended off the report with his neat
signature, folded it and inserted it into an official envelope,
which he addressed to his chief. By good fortune he met that
brilliant man coming into Scotland House as he himself was going
out.</p>

<p>'I think you did right,' said T.B. after he had heard the
story.</p>

<p>'I wonder what her game is? I have a good mind to detail a
man to take the whole case up.'</p>

<p>'Let me do it,' said Michael eagerly. T.B. Smith pursed his
lips.</p>

<p>'You are rather a big man for a job like that, Michael,' he
said; 'It may turn out to be nothing more than a common or
garden chorus-girl's romance.'</p>

<p>'Kate isn't the chorus-girl type,' said Michael; 'if it is
big enough for her to be in it, it is quite big enough for
me.'</p>

<p>The chief thought for a moment.</p>

<p>'Very well then,' he said at length. 'You can take on the
job. Do it by yourself if you possibly can, for I haven't any
men to spare. But keep in touch with me. Blowing a whistle won't
be of any service to you if these people mean business and get
after you.'</p>

<p>He hesitated again.</p>

<p>'Confound Kate!' he said. 'I suppose you have circulated a
description of the ice-cream merchant?'</p>

<p>All Latin criminals came under this generic description with
T.B.</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>'Well, good luck,' said the chief; 'but be careful!'</p>

<p>When the young man had gone, T.B. beckoned to an officer who
was passing.</p>

<p>'You're the very man, Barr,' he said. 'Pick up Mr.
Pretherston and don't lose him&mdash;you may choose your own
opposite number.'</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted, and hurried out after his charge.</p>

<p>Michael went away with a light heart. It was the kind of job
that he liked better than any other. He had not told the chief
all his suspicions. Kate's game was a big one. High-flyer as she
was, she was out for a height record&mdash;that he realized.
There was some association between her month with Lord
Flanborough, and the careful cultivation of Reggie Boltover's
acquaintance. When he came to think of it she must have met
Boltover while she was still with Flanborough. He had taken it
for granted that the girl was a resident secretary, but possibly
he had arrived at this conclusion in error. So it proved next
morning when he called Lord Flanborough's house on the
telephone, and had a private conversation with the butler. The
young lady, during the time she had been at Felton House, had
left every afternoon at four o'clock.</p>

<p>A little talk with the stage manager at the theatre showed
that the girl had never attended any of the morning rehearsals
and had missed one of the matinees. Michael saw this part of the
scheme plainly enough. Kate, through her spies, had discovered
that Boltover had an acquaintance who had a friend at the
theatre. She had come to the stage with no other object than
making a friend of the girl who all unwittingly was the
instrument by which she was to meet Reggie.</p>

<p>The detective knew that this was no chance acquaintance. He
followed the manoeuvres of Kate through all their devious paths.
He took the opportunity in the afternoon to call upon Reggie at
his office, which was something between a board-room and a
boudoir.</p>

<p>Reggie's theoretical interests were multifarious. He was the
nominal head of a dozen different corporations which his
industrious father had created for his profit. In practice he
knew very little about any of them and nothing about some.</p>

<p>'I hope your lady was not alarmed,' said Michael with
spurious anxiety.</p>

<p>'Oh, no, the lady was not alarmed, oh, no,' said Reggie,
shaking his head violently, 'oh, dear no. She was not alarmed.
Of course, it would have been different if she had been alone;
but being with me, naturally she&mdash;er&mdash;she&mdash;
er&mdash;was not alone.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' agreed Michael.</p>

<p>'No, she was not alarmed,' said Mr. Boltover; 'in fact, she
was very cool, remarkably cool. I have never seen anybody so
cool.'</p>

<p>'I hope when you see her again,' said Michael, 'you will tell
her I asked.'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said Mr. Boltover heartily, 'certainly I shall
tell her you asked.' And he added after a moment, 'When I meet
her again.'</p>

<p>'She seemed, if you will forgive the impertinence, so
interested in everything,' encouraged Michael.</p>

<p>'You are quite right,' said Reggie eagerly, 'You are
perfectly right. That just describes her. She is interested in
everything.'</p>

<p>'It is nice to meet people who are interested in one's
business,' Michael went on artlessly. 'I never mind people being
interested in my business, do you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear no,' replied Mr. Boltover in alarm, as though the
very thought that anybody should be discouraged from an interest
in his affairs caused him acute mental unhappiness. 'Oh, dear
no. Certainly not. Not at all.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' smiled Michael, 'she could not very well
understand all the complexities of your business, Mr. Boltover
&mdash;it is such an enormous one.'</p>

<p>'Well,' hesitated the other, 'I don't know, I am not so sure.
She is a very intelligent young lady. I was talking to her about
my business when this dreadful affair happened, and she was so
calm that she just went on talking about it, don't you know. My
business, I mean. I thought it was a most remarkable instance of
coolness. I was telling one of our directors today, about it,
and he thought it was a remarkable instance of coolness. Yes,
even when I was taking her home she told me a lot about herself
and&mdash;things. Her grandfather is a very wealthy man, a
financier. I didn't know that.'</p>

<p>Michael might have said that he too was unaware of the fact,
but he knew just the moment when a tactless interpolation might
dry up the fount of Mr. Boltover's eloquence.</p>

<p>'Very intelligent lady indeed,' wandered Mr. Boltover; 'oh
yes, I was talking about her grandfather&mdash;he is a very rich
man. She thought that he might be able to take one of our
properties off our hands. I was awfully surprised. Naturally, I
did not think she had any money being in the chorus and all that
&mdash;I hope I haven't been indiscreet,' he asked anxiously.
'You possibly did not know that she was on the stage.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I did,' said Michael with a smile; 'you have
betrayed nothing, Mr. Boltover.'</p>

<p>'I am awfully glad,' replied the other, relieved. 'What was I
saying, about her grandfather, yes. I think I might sell him
that property. I hate parting with properties&mdash;we have
refused quite a number of good offers&mdash;sheer sentiment,
don't you know.'</p>

<p>'But perhaps this is not a paying property.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, not at all,' said Mr. Boltover, 'by no manner of
means whatever. Still we don't like parting with them. Of
course, I talk a lot of rot about people wanting to buy the
works, and I always tell that great joke about a lunatic&mdash;
ha, ha&mdash;but really it isn't true. No, not really true,
oh, no.'</p>

<p>Michael had never heard the great joke about the lunatic.
What he was anxious to hear were details of Kate's projected
purchase, but in this he was foiled. There was precious little
of the business man about Mr. Reggie Boltover, but one lesson he
had learnt, and learnt thoroughly, and that was the art of
silence. His revered father was wont to say, 'If you never open
your mouth Reggie, nobody will know what an ass you are'; and in
business, at any rate, Reggie most religiously lived up to this
injunction.</p>

<p>What was the girl's object? Michael was puzzled. Strangely
enough, the obvious never occurred to him, or if it did he
dismissed it without a second consideration. He did not look
upon Kate as the type that would find any amusement, whatever
the profit might be, in the inveigling of a young fool to the
altar. Kate wanted the excitement, not the money. That was her
history. He had first met her when he was in the Special
Department, and it had been over a little matter of a King's
messenger's despatch bag which on a cross-channel journey had
mysteriously disappeared, though it was practically handcuffed
to the owner's wrist, that he had first become acquainted with
the girl. He was interested in her, but only mildly so, because,
at the time, he arrived at a somewhat hasty judgment. It was
later, when the strong room of the Muranic was forced and
twenty-five packets of diamonds vanished in mid-ocean, and when
he had been in charge of the investigations which had resulted
in the imprisonment of Colonel Westhanger, that he had first
formed a true estimate of the girl's character&mdash;an
estimate which he had had cause to modify, but never to
change.</p>

<p>Michael lived in a big block of flats near Baker Street,
where he maintained a somewhat elaborate establishment for an
inspector of police. He had, however, a private income of his
own which he had inherited from his maternal grandmother, and as
he was a man of simple tastes and very extravagant needs, he was
able to live very comfortably indeed. He reached his home a
little before eight o'clock, and was astonished as he came
through the lobby of the flat to meet Beston, his man-servant,
clad in fine raiment and going forth.</p>

<p>'Hello, Beston, where are you off to?' he asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>The man touched his hat cheerfully. 'I am going to the
theatre, sir, and thank you very much for the tickets,' he said.
'Cook went ten minutes ago and I stayed behind to tidy things
up.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Cook went ten minutes ago, did she?' said Michael.
'That's good. When did the tickets arrive?'</p>

<p>'About an hour ago, sir, by a district messenger. It was very
kind of you to wire to us that you were sending them.'</p>

<p>Michael laughed softly.</p>

<p>'Your surprise at my consideration hurts me, Beston,' he
said. 'I always do things like that. By the way, did they spell
your name correctly in the telegram?'</p>

<p>'I think so, sir,' said the man in surprise. He fumbled in
his pocket, and produced the orange slip.</p>

<p>'I am sending you two tickets for the theatre tonight. May
not be home until tomorrow.&mdash;Pretherston.'</p>

<p>The wire had been handed in at the Strand Office. Beston
sensed some difficulty.</p>

<p>'I hope it's all right, sir?' he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Quite all right,' replied Michael with a cheerful nod.
'Don't wait for me now; I shall not be in very long.' He mounted
the carpeted stairs, opened the door of his flat and closed it
carefully behind him. He went straight to his study, pulled down
the blinds and drew the thick curtains across the windows, then
he turned on the light, took up the telephone, and gave a
Treasury number.</p>

<p>'Is that Sergeant Pears?' he asked. 'Is there a telegram
waiting at the Yard for me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the sergeant's voice.</p>

<p>Michael winked at the wall.</p>

<p>'Do you mind opening and reading it?'</p>

<p>There was a little pause and then the sergeant repeated into
the receiver:&mdash;</p>

<p>'To Inspector Michael Pretherston, Scotland House. Come up by
the earliest train. Am staying at Adelphi.&mdash;T.B.'</p>

<p>'Handed in at Manchester, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the sergeant, 'at three-fifteen.'</p>

<p>'Is the chief in Manchester?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, he went by the morning train.'</p>

<p>'Excellent,' said Michael. 'Thank you very much, sergeant.'
He hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>This was Kate's work&mdash;the beautiful detail of it, the
knowledge she possessed of T.B. Smith's movements. She had
probably sent a man up on the same train with the chief, and had
given him the telegram in advance, with exact instructions as to
the minute it was to be handed in. Yes, it was Kate. Yet he
became uncomfortable at the thought it was not like her to leave
things to chance. How came she to miss him at the Yard? He
returned to the telephone and again called up his assistant.</p>

<p>'What time did the telegram arrive?' be asked.</p>

<p>The sergeant was apologetic.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry, sir, I am afraid it arrived while you were
here, this afternoon. It was given to a messenger to take in to
you, and in some extraordinary way the constable forgot it. I
have reprimanded him.'</p>

<p>'That's all right,' said Michael, relieved. His relief,
curiously founded, he might have found it difficult to explain.
It was the relief which the matador feels when he sees the bull
which steps so proudly into the ring, will put up a good fight.
It was the relief of the huntsman when a strong fox breaks from
covert. He wanted Kate and that extraordinary organization which
he had set himself to conquer, to be at its best that his
victory might be the more satisfactory.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was five minutes past eight. He
knew that his visitor would give the servants an hour, and he
must employ that hour profitably. He began to write rapidly on a
pad of scribbling paper, tearing of the sheets as fast as he had
filled them. He had been working for an hour when he heard a
bell tinkle. Someone was at the front door. He switched out the
light, walked into the passage (he had already removed his
shoes) and listened. Whoever was coming had sent an agent in
advance to discover whether the flat was empty. Again the bell
rang. Michael made no sign. It rang a third and last time. The
detective made his way stealthily to the window, and slipped
behind the curtains. He had left the study door open, so that he
could hear every sound. He had a few seconds to wait before the
faint click of the lock told him that the door had been opened.
He knew that the visitor would come to the study last, and he
proved to be right. One minute passed&mdash;as near as he
could judge&mdash;before he caught the flash of a lamp which
was directed cautiously to the curtained window. The light
passed slowly along the floor until it reached the skirting,
travelled round until it found the lower edge of the drawn
curtain. Through the slit he had cut in the heavy velvet
hangings Michael witnessed the search. Presently the light went
out focusing itself upon the electric switch. There was a click
and the room was illuminated.</p>

<p>The girl who stood by the desk was soberly dressed, and was
apparently in no hurry. She pulled her gloves off slowly, whilst
she allowed her eyes to rove over the littered table. Half a
dozen sheets of writing attracted her attention, and when her
gloves removed she picked the papers up, pulled the big writing
chair to the table, and sat down to read. She read the notes
through carefully and once she smiled. When she had finished she
put them down, leant back in the chair and looked around the
room, then&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come out, Mike,' she said.</p>

<p>Michael stepped forth without embarrassment.</p>

<p>'I was nearly deceived,' she said, 'with your precious
account of the happening at Sebo's, and then I realized that
this could not have been written more than a few minutes before.
You forgot to blot the last sheet and the ink is still
damp.'</p>

<p>She rubbed her fingers over to prove the fact. 'Why aren't
you in Manchester?' she asked.</p>

<p>The staggering question nearly took his breath away.</p>

<p>'Well, if you aren't the real Kate!' he said admiringly.</p>

<p>'I'm in your chair, I'm afraid,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not a bit.' He dropped into a deep settee. 'Now tell me all
the news. But before we go any farther,' he said with mock
concern, 'wouldn't you like a chaperon?'</p>

<p>'Don't worry,' she replied, 'I have a chaperon.'</p>

<p>'Not in my flat, I hope,' he said in a tone of alarm. 'You, I
can trust, Kate; but the idea of your low thieving friends being
up against all my movable goods gives me a little pain.'</p>

<p>She fished in her bag, and produced a little gold case. She
opened it and took out a cigarette.</p>

<p>'You won't have one, of course?'</p>

<p>'Not one of yours, Kate,' he said reproachfully. 'No, I'll
have one of my own if you don't mind.'</p>

<p>'I think you are very rude,' she said, with a lift of her
brows.</p>

<p>'It's better to be rudely awake than politely asleep,' he
said meaningly. 'When one has to deal with clever criminals, one
to take all sorts of precautions.'</p>

<p>She laughed and looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>'I wonder what made you a policeman?'</p>

<p>'Nature,' he said promptly.</p>

<p>She was puzzled. 'I don't quite get your humour,' she
said.</p>

<p>'Nature provides all things with some form of protection. It
gives the oyster its shell and the tiger its stripes. It gives
the squid his ink-sac, and the shark his teeth. Nature always
produces antidotes. When criminals are stupid, they have stupid
policemen to deal with them. When criminals are extraordinarily
clever, nature provides the police force with an officer of
unusual intelligence. I came to the police in blind obedience to
the laws of nature.'</p>

<p>She laughed softly in his face.</p>

<p>'It's so nice to be able to discuss things with a man of
sensibility,' she said. 'Of course, some of my friends are
awfully clever, and my uncle is very philosophical; but then
they all take a very one-sided view of things, and I think it's
so much better to hear the other side of every question. You can
get two views on all subjects except crime,' she went on. 'If
you believe in Darwin's theory, you can meet hosts of clever
people who bitterly oppose it. If you are a Christian scientist,
you can meet hosts of theosophists. Even if you are a firm
believer in monogamy, you can generally hire a Mormon to argue
on the other side. It is only when we come down to crime that
you meet the truly insular view, held by people who know nothing
whatever about its finesse, or the genius necessary to break the
laws without leaving a big hole to show where you went in and
another to show where you came out. That is why I like you,
Mike,' she said frankly.</p>

<p>'Any appreciation is very gratifying to me,' said Michael,
'but that which is so enthusiastic that it leads my admirer to
break into my flat to ravish my secret thoughts, is a little
overwhelming.'</p>

<p>'I wanted to know what you were saying about me,' she said,
'though I ought to have known that you would not leave things
about for me to read&mdash;still,' she justified herself, 'to
do myself justice, I did not expect to find your confidential
reports on your desk.'</p>

<p>There was a big safe in one corner of the room. 'I was going
to open that.' She nodded towards the strong-box. Then she
turned the conversation suddenly.</p>

<p>'You saw me the other night.'</p>

<p>'At Sebo's&mdash;yes,' he said. 'I saw you.'</p>

<p>'What did you think?' she asked quietly.</p>

<p>'I thought you were with the loquacious Mr. Boltover for a
special reason of your own,' he said slowly.</p>

<p>'He is an orator, isn't he?' she agreed, 'but he's quite a
nice boy, really. God didn't give him brains, and it's not fair
to make fun of a man's deficiencies.'</p>

<p>'What did you want from Reggie?' asked Michael.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to know all about him,' she said. 'Those kind
of people are always interesting to me.'</p>

<p>'What did you want from Reggie?' he asked again.</p>

<p>'How insistent you are!' she laughed. She got up and began
strolling about the room, taking down books from the big
bookshelf, and examining their titles.</p>

<p>'What catholic tastes you have, Mike&mdash;and Tennyson,
too. How depraved!'</p>

<p>'You will find a Browning somewhere,' he said carelessly.</p>

<p>'That's more encouraging,' she smiled. 'It's an awfully
comfortable room. Quite like the room I thought you would
have.'</p>

<p>She looked at a book-plate on the cover of one volume. 'You
were at Winchester, I see. So was uncle.'</p>

<p>'The poison and the antidote!'</p>

<p>'You are not fair with uncle. He's a mental degenerate, too.
Crime is a disease with him.'</p>

<p>'And with you?' said Michael quickly.</p>

<p>'It's a hobby. It's a tremendous excitement.'</p>

<p>She put the book down, and turned to him.</p>

<p>'You don't know what it's like. To work things out and make
them happen, to cover a couple of sheets of paper with writing
and then see all sorts of things move in obedience to those
instructions, to see thousands and tens of thousands of pounds
change hands, to know that men are going on long journeys, that
special trains are being run, that telegraph wires are humming
all over the Continent, that a dozen brilliant thief-catchers
are working and worrying in a vain attempt to undo all that
twenty or thirty lines of writing have done.'</p>

<p>'This will be used in evidence against you,' warned Michael
flippantly. The girl was not posing. Of that he was convinced.
Her big grey eyes were brighter, her whole face was alight with
the excitement of the thought, her voice had a new thrill. She
was exalted, transfigured at the thought of the power which her
shrewd brain gave to her.</p>

<p>'What do you want from Reggie?' he asked again.</p>

<p>The light faded out of her eyes and she was her normal self
again.</p>

<p>'Oh, I wanted to pick his pocket,' she said mockingly, 'or,
no, I know something better&mdash;I wanted to marry him. He's
worth two million.'</p>

<p>'I don't think you will ever marry for money,' said
Michael.</p>

<p>'What makes you say that?' she asked quickly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. 'That is the estimate I have
formed of you. I may be wrong.'</p>

<p>'I shall never marry,' she said with decision. 'I'm not of
the marrying kind. I hate men in some ways. I hate them so much,
that it gives me a real joy to take away the one thing in the
world that they really love. You know the Claude Duval tradition
&mdash;I mean the idealized Claude Duval of tradition, not the
sneak-thief valet of actuality&mdash;of robbing the rich and
never robbing the poor&mdash;well, I rob men, and I never rob
women.'</p>

<p>'In fact, you rob the people who have the money,' said
Michael. 'That isn't clever.'</p>

<p>'No, but it sounds awfully good. I'm thinking of including it
in the great speech I shall deliver one of these days at the Old
Bailey.'</p>

<p>'What did you want from Reggie?' he asked.</p>

<p>'You are almost monotonous,' she laughed. 'Well, I wanted
information.'</p>

<p>She turned, and again he saw that bright light in her eye,
and that eager look in her face.</p>

<p>'I will tell you, Michael Pretherston,' she said, pointing a
white finger toward him. 'We will play fair. I am going to do a
big thing. I am going to make the most wonderful steal that the
world has ever known. That is why I found Reggie. That is why I
made a martyr of myself, and endured the boredom of Lord
Flanborough's society.'</p>

<p>She clapped her hands like a child.</p>

<p>'It's a big thing, Michael, but it's full of complications,
wonderfully full of strategy, and I am going to do it all with
your assistance.'</p>

<p>He jumped up, and flung out his hand.</p>

<p>'Put it there, Kate,' he said.</p>

<p>'This is going to be the big thing for both of us, and I am
going to be the victor. If I win, I have whatever I am after. If
you win, you have me,' she said with a little laugh.</p>

<p>He looked at her in silence.</p>

<p>'I can almost see you gripping my arm, and pushing me into
the steel pen,' she said. 'I can see you sitting in court in a
brown&mdash;no, a blue&mdash;overcoat, with your hat nicely
balanced on your knees, looking up at me in the dock, and
wondering how I am going to take it.'</p>

<p>A cloud passed over his face.</p>

<p>'You're a pessimistic little devil,' he growled. 'No, I
wasn't thinking about that.'</p>

<p>'What were you thinking about?' she asked, her eyes wide open
in surprise.</p>

<p>'I was thinking I'd marry you,' he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him in amusement.</p>

<p>'You're mad, aren't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said. 'Didn't you know?'</p>

<p>'Marry you?' she said scornfully. 'Great Heavens!'</p>

<p>'You might do worse,' he said with his cheerful smile.</p>

<p>'Can you name anything I could do that would be more
hopelessly degrading than marry a policeman?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'you might be an old maid and keep cats. You
take it for granted, of course,' he went on, 'that I am letting
you go now.</p>

<p>'Naturally,' she replied, 'I have given you something to live
for.'</p>

<p>'You may be right,' he said quietly, and opened the door for
her. They walked down the felt-covered passage to the front
door.</p>

<p>'I owe you something,' she said as they stood in the doorway.
'The young man from the South nearly put an end to my promising
career.'</p>

<p>'A little thing like that is hardly worth mentioning. Good
night, Kate. Are you sure it is safe for you to be out alone so
late?'</p>

<p>She made a little face at him, and went tripping down the
stairs. She turned into the street, but had not gone two paces
when a hand caught her arm.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said a voice. By the light of a street lamp she
recognized her captor as a detective sergeant from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>Before she could protest a voice spoke from the darkness of
the balcony above, and it was the voice of Michael.</p>

<p>'All right, sergeant,' he said. She shook herself free of the
man and looked wrathfully up at the dim figure.</p>

<p>'I forgot you'd have your nurse handy, Michael,' she
jeered.</p>

<p>'Good night, dear,' said the voice from the balcony, and to
her intense annoyance she felt an extraordinary sensation wholly
new to her, but which with her quick woman's wit she correctly
diagnosed, as she hurried angrily along the street.</p>

<p>For Kate Westhanger had blushed for the first time in her
life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="first">LORD FLANBOROUGH gave a dinner-party. He was a
methodical man, and invariably made his arrangements a long time
in advance, and he was not unnaturally annoyed when, at the
eleventh hour, his daughter suggested a change in the plans.</p>

<p>'My dear Moya,' he said testily, 'don't be absurd. Surely
after what has passed&mdash;after his extraordinary attitude
&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, Daddy, what nonsense!' said the girl. 'Michael is really
a good sort, and he will be amusing. I really cannot sit out a
dinner with all those boring people, and if you don't invite
him, I shall have a headache.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear,' protested her father, 'Sir Ralph will be
quite entertainment enough, surely?'</p>

<p>'Sir Ralph is the biggest bore of all,' she said calmly.
'Please let me have my way.'</p>

<p>So, to his surprise and amusement, Michael received an
invitation to dinner, couched in such gracious terms that he
formed the wholly incorrect impression that some other guest had
failed Moya and that he was being called in to relieve her of
the responsibility for thirteen people sitting at table.</p>

<p>It was even a more dreary dinner-party than Moya had
imagined. Sir Ralph Sapson was amusing in his own way, but his
own way was not Moya's way. He was a stout, handsome, young man
on the right side of thirty, immensely wealthy, and according to
her father, immensely capable. Though there had been no definite
arrangement, it was understood, mainly by Lord Flanborough, that
Sir Ralph desired a closer association with the Flanborough
family than his directorships gave him.</p>

<p>The remainder of the guests were even less entertaining than
Sir Ralph. There were three other members of the peerage: Old
Lord Katstock, who was a political lord who had once occupied a
position as Under-Secretary in some forgotten administration;
the Marquis of Cheddar, who was a sporting lord and had theories
on the Bruce Low system of breeding; Lord Dumburton, who was a
soldier lord, very poor and very wicked, unless rumour lied; and
an assortment of directors which included Mr. Reginald Boltover,
who recognized Michael with a guilty start, and took no interest
whatever in his dinner, but waited with bated breath for Michael
to reveal his guilty secret.</p>

<p>There were two or three ladies, who gave Michael the
impression that they had been dipped in diamonds by their
herculean maids, and there was a thin, dowdily dressed lady with
a hooked nose.</p>

<p>'Has the Duchess borrowed anything, Moya?' said Michael under
his breath.</p>

<p>'Not from me,' said the girl significantly, 'but father is
always susceptible. She's an awfully good sort really, but I do
wish she wouldn't take snuff.'</p>

<p>Michael knew, or was known to, them all.</p>

<p>'It's a rum idea of yours, going into the police,
Pretherston,' said Sir Ralph with that air of patronage which he
reserved for people poorer than himself.</p>

<p>'It's just as rum an idea as your going into trade and
keeping shops,' said Michael.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>'We have to do something to make an honest living,' he said.
'I suppose the reference to the shops is my association with the
Colonial Retail Stores. That makes a hundred thousand a year,
Pretherston.'</p>

<p>'Then you have a hundred thousand reasons for selling bad
jam,' said Michael. 'I've given up buying things at your
shops.'</p>

<p>'That is a tragedy,' said Ralph with heavy humour. 'Try us
again and we will endeavour to merit your patronage.'</p>

<p>'I have another bone to pick with you,' said Michael. He did
not like Sir Ralph Sapson. 'I came up the other day from
Seahampton; the railway carriage was beastly, hadn't been
cleaned for a month, and the train was fifty minutes late. The
London and Seahampton is another of your profitable ventures,
isn't it?'</p>

<p>'I am told that I have an interest in it,' said Sir Ralph,
with a smile at the girl; 'but, really, my dear Pretherston,
when you find a railway so badly conducted you ought to complain
to the police.'</p>

<p>This amused him so much that he laughed without restraint,
and was, as a result, compelled to explain his joke to fourteen
people who were anxious to share it.</p>

<p>Michael had to leave early. 'I should dearly love to stay and
play bridge with you,' he said.</p>

<p>'Michael, you are a little horrid, aren't you?' asked the
girl.</p>

<p>'Horrid!' he asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>'You are so practical; you weren't always like that.'</p>

<p>'And you weren't always unpractical,' he laughed.</p>

<p>She had hoped&mdash;she did not know exactly what she had
hoped, but the new Michael was so unlike the old that she could
almost have cried with vexation. Gone was the old recklessness,
the old extravagance (save in directions annoying to her guests)
and the old adoration which shone in his eyes. There was an
unpleasant feeling that he was laughing at her all the time, and
that did not add to her happiness.</p>

<p>'I don't think you're nice, anyway,' she said. 'Won't you
come more often to see us?'</p>

<p>'When you lose a pearl necklace, or find the hired lady
surreptitiously carrying off your provisions, drop a line to
Inspector Michael Pretherston, Room 26, Scotland House, and I
will be with you in a jiffy.'</p>

<p>'By which I understand you don't want to see us at all,' she
said petulantly.</p>

<p>'I am sorry I asked you tonight.'</p>

<p>'I, for my part, am very glad,' he said.</p>

<p>Later, when Michael had left, Sir Ralph was to find her a
very unamusing companion, though why she should be annoyed with
her sometime suitor, only a woman can understand. She did not
love him. In some ways she rather disliked him, and possibly the
underlying reason for her inviting him at all, was in order to
confirm and seal her indifference. If Michael had been in the
least way attentive, had shown the slightest desire to recover
the lost ground and to resume the old romance, she would have
found an intense satisfaction in checking him, and would have
gone to bed that night happy in the knowledge that she had
permanently attached to her, one for whom she had not the
slightest tenderness. This is the way of women who when offered
a dish, a dress, a colour, a material or a man, invariably say,
'I would like to see something else.'</p>

<p>Her abstraction was so marked that Sir Ralph thought she was
ill, which instantly produced the headache which it is every
woman's privilege to adopt at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>'You ought to take care of Moya, Flanborough,' he said to his
host at parting; 'she's not at all well.'</p>

<p>'I have noticed it,' said the dutiful parent, who had noticed
nothing of the kind, and had inwardly remarked that Moya was
sulking about something. 'You have an extraordinary eye for
things of that kind, Sir Ralph.'</p>

<p>'I understand human beings,' admitted Sir Ralph; 'it has been
my one engrossing study in life. It is almost a vice with me.
When a man comes into my office, I can generally sum up his
character, his business and his capabilities before he has
opened his mouth.'</p>

<p>'It's a great gift,' said Lord Flanborough solemnly.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Sapson was in a particularly cheerful mood that
night. In the brief interview which he had had with his future
father-in-law, he had not only secured a tacit agreement of his
right to be admitted to the family and an expression of Lord
Flanborough's approval, but he had clinched a very excellent
business arrangement which had been hanging fire for twelve
months&mdash;an arrangement which may be briefly summarized
&mdash;Lord Flanborough was the chairman of the Austral-African
Steamship Company which carried merchandise and passengers
between Cape Town and Plymouth. Sir Ralph was the chairman of
the London and Seahampton Railway and was also chairman and a
large shareholder in the Seahampton Dock Improvement Company.
The docks had improved much more rapidly than had the trade
which could justify their existence, and the deal which was
really a side-line to the more romantic business of a
matrimonial alliance, was that the ships of the A.-A. line
should shamelessly abandon Plymouth and Liverpool, and should
have their headquarters at Seahampton, an arrangement which
offered advantages on both sides, since Lord Flanborough was not
without interest in the Seahampton docks.</p>

<p>The night was chilly, a full moon rode serenely in the skies;
there was a touch of frost in the air, and more than a suspicion
of frost on the sidewalk. Sir Ralph Sapson's car was waiting,
but he ordered the chauffeur to drive home, saying that he would
prefer to walk. Sir Ralph lived in Park Lane, so that he had
nearly a mile to cover, but he was in that mood which made light
of so unusual an exercise. He reached the door of his imposing
residence, and his hand was on the bell when he heard his name
called. He had noticed, as he walked up to his door, that a
little distance along the road was a big motor-car, its head
lamps gleaming, and a chauffeur busy tinkering with the
engine.</p>

<p>'I am afraid you don't know me,' said a sweet voice.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph raised his hat. The girl who stood on the sidewalk
was obviously a lady. She was as obviously beautifully dressed,
and Sir Ralph, who had an appraising eye, valued the ermine
cloak she wore at something not far short of a thousand pounds.
A single broad collar of diamonds about her slender throat was
all the jewellery she wore.</p>

<p>'I am afraid I don't,' he said.</p>

<p>'I only met you once,' said the girl timidly, 'in Paris. You
were introduced to me in the foyer of&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, at the Opera, of course,' said Sir Ralph, who,
amongst other things, was a patron of the Arts. She nodded and
seemed pleased that he had remembered her, a compliment which
Sir Ralph did not fail to observe.</p>

<p>'My car has broken down,' she said, 'and I was wondering if I
could beg your hospitality. It is so horribly shivery here.' She
drew her cloak tighter around her.</p>

<p>'With all the pleasure in life,' said Sir Ralph heartily;
'but I have only a bachelor's establishment, you know,' he
laughed.</p>

<p>He rang the bell and the door was opened instantly.</p>

<p>'Put some lights in the drawing-room,' he said to the
servant. 'Is there a fire there?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir Ralph,' said the man. 'Can I get you some coffee or
a little wine?'</p>

<p>She had pulled a big chair up before the blaze, and was
resting her little white slippers upon the silver fender. Her
shapely hands were outspread to the fire, and Sir Ralph noted
that though many jewels glittered on her fingers there was no
sign of the plain gold circle of bondage.</p>

<p>'You will think it awfully rude of me, but I cannot recall
your name,' he said, when the servant had gone.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose you do; my name is rather a barbarous one,'
she laughed. 'I am the Princess Bacheffski.'</p>

<p>'Why, of course!' said Sir Ralph heartily, 'I remember
distinctly now.'</p>

<p>To do him justice, Russian princesses are not unusual
phenomena in Paris, and he had a very bad memory for foreign
names.</p>

<p>'I suppose I am being very unconventional,' she said with a
little grimace, and for the first time he noticed that she spoke
with the slightest accent; 'but needs must when the devil
drives, and I had either to sit in that cold car, or grasp the
good fortune which fate threw in my way. And you, Sir Ralph, are
looking just the same as when I saw you last. You are one of the
big business men of London, aren't you?'</p>

<p>'I have a few interests,' admitted Sir Ralph modestly. They
talked of Paris, which Sir Ralph knew, and of Russia through
which he had travelled on one occasion, and of London, and then
the coffee came and, a few minutes later, her chauffeur, to tell
her that the repairs had been effected.</p>

<p>'Before I go I want to ask you one favour, Sir Ralph,' she
said.</p>

<p>She was a little embarrassed and nervously twisted a ring on
her finger. Sir Ralph saw this and wondered.</p>

<p>'You have only to ask anything, Princess, and it is granted,'
he said gallantly.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment and bit her lip in thought. 'I am
going to take you into my confidence, and I know as a man of
honour'&mdash;Sir Ralph bowed&mdash;'you will not betray me.
I am in London, but I am not supposed to be in London.'</p>

<p>She looked at him anxiously as she made this confession.</p>

<p>'I understand,' said Sir Ralph, which was not true.</p>

<p>'You have probably noticed&mdash;you were so quick at
seeing those things&mdash;that I am not wearing my wedding
ring. Well'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;'Dimitri and I have
quarrelled, and I do not want him to find me. I haven't been to
the Embassy, or to call on any of my old friends.'</p>

<p>'You may be sure,' said Sir Ralph, 'that your secret is safe.
I may say,' he added, 'that this is not the first time I have
been entrusted with a confidence as delicate.'</p>

<p>'I know I can trust you,' she said, warmly gripping his hand.
'I am staying in a little furnished flat which I have taken in
Half Moon Street. I have a duenna with me for the sake of the
proprieties&mdash;Dimitri is so funny about those things
&mdash;so if a busy man can spare the time, I am always in
between four and five&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It will give me the greatest happiness to renew the
acquaintance,' said Sir Ralph and raised her hand to his lips.
Sir Ralph retired to rest more pleased with himself than
ever.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">NO man has ever understood a woman, for the
simple reason that woman is unintelligible even to her own kind.
If she were not, and if she were susceptible to explanation by
her own sisters, be sure that her own sisters would lose no time
in telling the first man she met all about her.</p>

<p>Lady Moya Felton possessed that rare combination of talents,
beauty and acumen. She dressed well, she spoke well, and she
looked well. She was a product of Newnham, an institution which,
more often than not, gives the world a being which is something
less than a woman and something more than a babu. This being is
crammed with erudition and for many years fights life with a
textbook. Sometimes she continues to the end, very self-assured,
very confident of the facts she has culled from the printed
page, and very determined that she will never surrender her
mechanical facts or her machine-made values. Sometimes she
succumbs to the humanizing influences which daily contact with
the verities of life bring to her and develops into a useful and
charming member of society.</p>

<p>Moya had absorbed just as much of life as she thought was
necessary to her comfort. She stopped short of the supreme
lesson which finds expression in cheerful sacrifice, but she was
an eminently pleasing person, and never discussed biological
justice or gave forth as her own the shoddy philosophies she had
acquired in hall. Therefore, she was bearable. Moreover, by
realizing&mdash;here her instinct served her&mdash;that
Newnham had turned her out fit for nothing better than a
church-going school-ma'am, she conveyed an impression of her
education rather than declaimed the fact.</p>

<p>Practical as she was, she had a guilty secret, not only a
very dear one, to be hugged tight to her heart, but one which
evoked the unusual emotion of profound disapproval in the more
ordered compartments of her mind. Moya was a dreamer, a
cold-blooded romanticist who had wonderful adventures with
wonderful people whenever she walked or rode abroad. In the
privacy of her big limousine, she would be absorbed in events
of her own creation, wholly monopolized by men and women who
bore no likeness to, and had no relation with, any person in her
somewhat extensive list of acquaintances. She would often find
herself in situations so absurdly impossible that even the penny
novelette reader would have rejected them with the scorn which
their crudity deserved. She did not dream of living people, the
mere mental suggestion&mdash;for the roving mind has a trick
of taking charge at times&mdash;that any of her visionary
heroes had his prototype in flesh and blood, ensured the
ejection of the offending dream-man and the substitution of
another, more wildly improbably, but at the same time more
unlikely to challenge relationship with anybody in the material
world.</p>

<p>She could dream and yet accept the cold practicality of a
Ralph Sapson, and calmly consider a marriage so hopelessly
prosaic.</p>

<p>That was inexplicable.</p>

<p>For an engaged lover Ralph had been singularly remiss. He had
called once since his unemotional declaration of love. To do him
justice he had skipped the tender demonstrations which usually
accompany even the most formal engagements, and had got down to
the question of settlement in the shortest space of time. This
was as Moya could wish, for she also was embarrassed at the
thought that a human being might possibly approach&mdash;
suffering in comparison&mdash;the extravagance, wordless and
intangible as it was, of her shadowy friends.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance that romance in concrete form
did not come to Moya, until the very week she engaged herself to
marry Sir Ralph Sapson. It came in a curious way. She had driven
to Leicester Square to see an exhibition of pictures. It was one
of those collections which dawn upon London, bringing in its
wake a name which has never been heard before, save in a very
select circle and is never heard again outside of that circle;
an orbit which swings beyond the ken of ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>She went into the gallery and found it a veritable desert.
Save for a young man and a small pinched and preoccupied girl,
wearing a large pendant in which was inserted the photograph of
her uninteresting fiancé, the place was empty. The girl with the
pendant carried her excuse in her hand, in the shape of a bunch
of catalogues. There was less excuse for the young man for he
was healthy in appearance, and it was not raining.</p>

<p>Moya began a conscientious inspection of the pictures,
chiefly remarkable for their colouring and for the atmosphere
which the artist had managed to secure. Indeed, the pictures
were all atmosphere. The girl made a slow progress along the
wall, comparing each framed atrocity with her catalogue and
striving to sense, dimly, something of the artist's honourable
intentions.</p>

<p>She looked round once to discover what effect the pictures
had upon her fellow sightseer. He was standing before a long
panel representing, if the catalogue had been rightly compiled,
'A Blue Wind on a Green Hill.' His face bore an expression of
the deepest gloom, his hat was tilted to the back of his head
and his hands were thrust deeply into his trousers pockets. The
longer he looked at the'Blue Wind on the Green Hill' the more
morose and unhappy did he appear.</p>

<p>This then was the attitude which the new colourist school
demanded, one of fierce but approving antagonism if the paradox
be permitted. She moved up till she was almost by his side,
never thinking that in the presence of the girl with the
programmes and the photographic miniature, he would dare address
her. Yet he did.</p>

<p>'What do you think of that one?' he asked without turning his
head.</p>

<p>She was taken aback and was prepared to be chilly and
non-committal. She looked at his face, and the nearer view was a
pleasing one. He was very fair, very good-looking, and had the
bluest eyes she had ever seen in a man. He was also unshaven,
and his collar was not clean, but he was well-dressed enough,
and his tone was wholly Oxford&mdash;and Balliol at that.</p>

<p>'I think it is rather weird,' she said.</p>

<p>'So do I,' he nodded vigorously, 'I think it is&mdash;
&ldquo;weird&rdquo; is the word. As a work of art how does it
strike you?'</p>

<p>She hesitated. She had a full range of studio jargon which
she had acquired in the course of her after-education, and could
speak glibly on atmosphere, tone and light. She knew that it was
possible to refer to a still-life study of a bunch of bananas as
being 'full of movement,' without being guilty of an absurdity.
In fact, she knew enough about art to have occupied a position
on any average newspaper as a critic.</p>

<p>'As a work of art,' she said, 'it is original and a little
eccentric.'</p>

<p>'Frankly?' he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>All the time he spoke he was glaring at the picture, and had
not turned his head toward her.</p>

<p>'Frankly,' she replied, 'I think these are
monstrosities.'</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>'I agree with you,' he said, 'and I know better than anybody
else how monstrous they are&mdash;I painted 'em!'</p>

<p>Moya gasped.</p>

<p>'I am awfully sorry,' she began.</p>

<p>'I am sorry too&mdash;that I painted them,' he replied. 'I
am not sorry that I exhibited them, because all my friends told
me that they were wonderful, and naturally I get some
satisfaction from proving that my friends are mentally
deficient.'</p>

<p>He turned round and looked at her, and was in turn
surprised.</p>

<p>'Hello,' he said, staring at her with his blue eyes wide
open, 'I thought you were much older.'</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>'The fact is I didn't look at you,' he confessed. 'How can
anybody look at anything with these beastly things staring one
in the face? Hi! Emma!'</p>

<p>Fortunately the programme girl was looking his way, and
realized that he was speaking to her. 'Your name is Emma, I
suppose?'</p>

<p>'No, sir,' said the girl impressively; 'my name is
Evangeline.'</p>

<p>He turned to the girl.</p>

<p>'Here is an Evangeline whom I thought was an Emma; and here
are my Emmas that I thought were Evangelines,' he said
despairingly. 'What made you come to this exhibition?'</p>

<p>'I saw a criticism of the pictures in yesterday's
papers.'</p>

<p>'In the Megaphone,' he said accusingly.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;it was a very flattering criticism, I thought,'
said Moya.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'I wrote it myself,' he said without shame.</p>

<p>He turned to the programme girl. 'Tell your master to shut up
the gallery, have the pictures packed away and sent home.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Moya in alarm, 'I hope my stupid views won't
influence you.'</p>

<p>'It isn't your stupid view,' he said; 'it is my original
stupid view. You see, I can't paint really. I know not the
slightest thing about art. I have never had an artistic
education or served under any master. I am a genius. These works
are works of a genius. The frames cost a lot of money, and the
amount of paint I have used is prodigious. There is everything
there'&mdash;he waved his hand to the covered
walls&mdash;'except the know-how.'</p>

<p>She murmured a conventional expression of sympathy, but he
did not invite sympathy, he invited condemnation, and seemed to
find a comfort in his own misfortune, and was obviously all the
happier that he had reached a decision on his own merits.</p>

<p>They walked out of the gallery together, and Moya wondered at
herself. That she had in so brief a space of time entered into
the aspirations and disappointments of a perfect stranger, and
now felt something of his chagrin, was truly amazing.</p>

<p>'I know you,' he said, breaking off in the midst of a
sardonic dissertation on art; 'you are Lady Moya Melton of
Pelton.'</p>

<p>'Felton,' she suggested, amused.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, Felton,' he nodded; 'I saw your portrait in the
academy, a very bad portrait too.'</p>

<p>'People thought it was rather good,' she demurred.</p>

<p>'Idealized, but lord, what do I know about art? This
char-à-banc de luxe is yours, I presume.' He pointed to the big
limousine.</p>

<p>'It does happen to be mine,' she said. 'My father gave it to
me on my twenty-first birthday.'</p>

<p>He inspected it critically.</p>

<p>'I wonder if I know as much about motor-cars as I know about
painting,' he said. 'I used to think I knew something about
both; but here, at any rate, is something real, it is a very
nice car.' He opened the door for her, and she offered her
hand.</p>

<p>'I am so sorry about the pictures,' she said.</p>

<p>'Don't worry,' he replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>She thought for a moment.</p>

<p>'Can I drop you anywhere?'</p>

<p>He fingered his unshaven chin.</p>

<p>'If you know of a nice deep pond where a man may drown
himself without interference, I shall be obliged if you will
take me there,' he said gravely; then, seeing the look of alarm
in her eyes, he laughed.</p>

<p>'You probably don't know my name,' he said.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she did not, and had been trying
throughout the interview to take a surreptitious look at the
catalogue. She knew it was something like Brixel.</p>

<p>'Fonso Blaxton,' he said shortly. '&ldquo;Fonso&rdquo;
stands for Alphonso&mdash;a perfectly rotten name, isn't it?
It would be quite all right for an artist. If there's any need
to send flowers, my address is Oxford Chambers.' He shook hands
abruptly, handed her into the car, and closed the door. He
waited only the briefest spell, and had lifted his hat and
vanished before the car had started.</p>

<p>Moya drove back with so much to occupy her thoughts that she
forgot to dream. So preoccupied was she, that she passed Sir
Ralph Sapson and his chic companion turning into the park before
she was aware that he was bowing to her, or had time to note
anything more about the lady than that she was very beautifully
gowned and that her sunshade was tilted at such an angle that it
was impossible to see her face.</p>

<p>'Who is your friend?'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph turned with a smirk.</p>

<p>'That, Princess,' he said, 'is Lady Moya Felton.'</p>

<p>'Oh, your fiancée,' said the girl. 'Isn't it a bore being in
London incognito? I should so much like to have met her.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps some day,' said Ralph.</p>

<p>'I should dearly love to,' murmured the girl; 'but please go
on, you interest me so much. I am beginning to realize why you
English are so successful. You seem to know every detail of your
business.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear no,' protested Sir Ralph good-humouredly. 'I am
rather a dunce if the truth be told, but one must know something
of the details.'</p>

<p>'Something!' said the girl, raising her eyebrows. 'I think
you are very modest. Why, you seem to know the workings of your
railway system from beginning to end.'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph stroked his moustache thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'One has to go into things,' he said vaguely, 'and of course
one takes a lot of credit for things which one is not entitled
to take credit for. But the gold train was my idea
altogether.'</p>

<p>'I never thought there was so much romance in business,' said
the Princess; then suddenly, 'Do you mind telling the driver to
turn about? I am tired of the park now.'</p>

<p>He leant forward and instructed the chauffeur and the big car
circled round.</p>

<p>'I am glad you suggested that,' he said.</p>

<p>'Why?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Did you notice a man in a grey felt hat talking to a lady in
a victoria?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'He's a weird bird,' said Sir Ralph; 'he is a policeman,
Michael Pretherston, Lord Pretherston's brother. I don't want to
meet him, apart from the fact that he might recognize you, even
through that veil of yours which would deny him so much
happiness,' he added gallantly.</p>

<p>'Tell me some more about the gold train,' she said.</p>

<p>Nothing loath, Sir Ralph explained. He told the story of the
Seahampton Docks, and the big liners which would be coming in,
and the new services he had inaugurated to meet the increased
traffic.</p>

<p>'We shall carry practically the whole of the gold which comes
from the Rand mines,' he said impressively. 'Naturally we have
to be very careful, although there is not much danger in
England. The gold train is really two big safes on wheels. To
outward appearance, they are just like ordinary closed railway
trucks. In reality they are steel boxes, burglar-proof and
fire-proof. Of course, nothing can go wrong, and even if we had
a smash the cars would be uninjured. But I have the best men on
the system to run the train.'</p>

<p>'How very fascinating!' she said, intensely interested. 'I
suppose you have a most elaborate timetable?'</p>

<p>'I have worked out every detail myself,' he said. He took out
a notebook from his pocket. 'I will show you, Princess,' he said
impressively.</p>

<p>He turned the gilt-edged leaves until he came to two pages
covered with his fine writing.</p>

<p>'You will get some idea of the work involved in the running
of a special train,' he said. 'Here are the times. There is the
driver's name, the fireman's name, the assistant fireman's name,
the names of the two guards.'</p>

<p>She looked at the book. 'I cannot read your writing very
well,' she laughed. 'You must not forget that my family was very
old-fashioned, and my dear father never allowed us to learn the
Roman alphabet until we were quite grown up. But I can see what
a very difficult business it is.'</p>

<p>She handed the book back to him with a little sigh.</p>

<p>'I am afraid I am very stupid,' she said. 'Figures always
bother me, and I can see that you revel in them. I hate writing,
but by the way your book is filled, it seems that you revel in
it! I cannot understand people who like to write. It is always
an agony for me to compose an ordinary letter. My thoughts come
so much faster than my poor hand can move.'</p>

<p>She took a pad and a pencil from the silver-mounted
stationary case in front of her. 'I will show you something,'
she said. She wrote rapidly, resting the pad on her knee, and he
watched her in astonishment as she proceeded to fill the
sheet.</p>

<p>'There,' she said triumphantly, 'that is what I can do
best.'</p>

<p>'It looks like shorthand,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is something like Russian shorthand,' said the girl, 'and
I am such a lazy person that I always use it whenever I want to
write a note. My secretary, who is the only person in the world
who understands it, transcribes it. I do it because I hate
writing.'</p>

<p>'So you are clever, after all, Princess.'</p>

<p>She reached out her little hand, and patted his arm.</p>

<p>'You don't know how clever I am,' she said, and they both
laughed together.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="first">COLONEL WESTHANGER looked at his watch.</p>

<p>'She's twenty minutes late already,' he said.</p>

<p>Gregori rolled another cigarette, and looked inquiringly at
Dr. Philip Garon, who was fingering his trim beard and talking
with some animation to the middle-aged pallid man, who was known
to the world as Mr. Cunningham, and to the police as an expert
safe breaker.</p>

<p>All Crime Street, with the exception of the admirable Mr.
Millet, was present. The Bishop with his large placid face was
playing bezique with Francis Stockmar. Colling Jacques, who had
the appearance of a prosperous butler who had settled down to
the management of his own private hotel was reading the
newspaper. Mr. Mulberry, that respectable man with his grey
side-whiskers and his sad dog-like eyes, was discussing
Renaissance architecture with the other Stockmar; and the
Colonel, pacing the room impatiently, stopped now and again to
fling a word to one or the other.</p>

<p>Presently there was a slight sound in the hall below, and the
Colonel went to the door of the room.</p>

<p>'She is here,' he said, and passed out to the landing to meet
Kate. She was wearing a dark coat-dress and a big black fox wrap
which she loosened and flung off as she came into the room. It
was notable that the Colonel, who had every right to complain of
her unpunctuality, did not attempt to criticize her for her late
arrival, other than to make a mild reference to the fact that he
had expected her earlier.</p>

<p>She looked round the room.</p>

<p>'Where is Millet?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Millet is working on the telegrams,' he said, and she
nodded, satisfied.</p>

<p>'Everything is ready now,' she said.</p>

<p>'Did you see Boltover, Mr. Mulberry?'</p>

<p>He rose and came toward her with that noiseless step of
his.</p>

<p>'A most amiable young man,' he said in his unctuous sing-song
voice, 'such a pleasant young man! We had a very long talk
together.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'We arranged everything.'</p>

<p>He took a long envelope from his pocket, pulled out a stiff
parchment, and handed it to her with the gravity and deference
of an ambassador delivering a treaty to his sovereign lady. She
ran her eyes quickly over the document, turned its crinkling
page and read rapidly to the last flourishing signatures.</p>

<p>'That's all right,' she said, and returned the document. The
long table had been placed in the middle of the room, and to
this, without instructions, the whole of the company had drawn.
Colonel Westhanger sat at one end and Kate at the other.
From her bag she took a thick roll of manuscript, cut the
strings that fastened it, and smoothed the sheets out before
her. One by one she called their names, at the same time handing
them, in some cases one, in other cases two or three sheets
covered with writing.</p>

<p>'You have a week to master all this,' she said, 'and in a
week's time we will meet again and I will see that everybody
understands.'</p>

<p>She caught Jacques' eye.</p>

<p>'About men?' she said. 'How many have you arranged for?'</p>

<p>'Sixty,' he said. 'I have been bringing them into England for
the past month.'</p>

<p>'Will sixty be enough?' she asked dubiously. 'How many did we
use for the Bank of Edinburgh?'</p>

<p>'That was a different job,' said Jacques. 'We had to cut
through thirty feet of concrete. I used two hundred and twenty
in relays of thirty.'</p>

<p>'Sixty will be quite enough,' she said after a moment's
thought. 'You will see that I have allowed only for fifty, but
if they are the right kind of people&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They are all good men, most of them from Italy, a few of
them from France, and one Portuguese. They are the pick of my
men, and represent years of organization.'</p>

<p>'You have full details there, Cunningham,' she said, turning
to that dour man. 'I took a shorthand note about the gold train,
the driver and the officials who will be on the train, and I
have all their addresses except one. You will find a cross
against that; I think the address is Berne Street, Seahampton,
but I had no time to verify it.'</p>

<p>'This will be easy,' said Cunningham, reading his
instructions. 'These times won't be altered, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'If they are, I shall know all about it,' said the girl.
'Every one must make a note of those instructions in his own
code, and must do it pretty quickly.'</p>

<p>'What's the hurry?' asked Westhanger, who alone of the men
about the table had received no paper.</p>

<p>'I want to see every sheet burnt before we leave the room,'
she said.</p>

<p>The Colonel frowned.</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'I want all the papers burnt before we leave the room,' she
said again emphatically.</p>

<p>Her uncle growled, but the others knew her well enough to
realize that she had an excellent reason.</p>

<p>Each man in his own way, some in notebooks, some on the back
of loose sheets of paper, faithfully transcribed the
instructions, using his own pet abbreviations, his own
particular symbols; and one by one, as fast as they completed
their copies, the girl collected the papers, heard the
instructions read over, corrected one, amended another, and
finally, gathering all the sheets in her hand, walked to the
fireplace, deposited them in the grate, and set a lighted match
to them. She watched them burn until they were black ash, and
put her foot upon them, crushing the embers to dust.</p>

<p>'Are you nervous?' asked the Colonel sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Are you?' she asked coolly.</p>

<p>'Well, it does seem a little&mdash;'</p>

<p>From the corner of the room came a soft but insistent purr.
The men jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>'Put away the tables quickly,' said the girl under her
breath.</p>

<p>They separated the tables into three parts. With an agility
remarkable in one of his years, the Colonel flung a cloth over
each, lifted a pot of flowers on to one, arranged a photograph
on another, and left the third to the bezique players. The girl
seated herself at the piano, opened it and began a soft movement
from Rigoletto.</p>

<p>'Sing,' she said under her breath. The obedient Mr. Mulberry
shuffled up to her side. He had a pleasing voice and the girl
picked up the strain ...</p>

<p>'I am sorry to disturb the harmony,' said Michael Pretherston
from the doorway.</p>

<p>'May I ask what is the meaning of this intrusion?' demanded
Colonel Westhanger haughtily, as half a dozen Scotland Yard men
crowded into the room behind their chief.</p>

<p>'It is what is vulgarly known as a raid,' said Michael.
'Everybody will remain where he is while I run a foot rule over
him. Parsons, you will take these gentlemen one by one into an
adjoining room and search them most thoroughly. Mrs. Gray'
&mdash;he called to the door and a stout middle-aged woman with
a pleasant face appeared&mdash;'you will perform the same kind
office for Miss Westhanger.'</p>

<p>'Why not &ldquo;Kate&rdquo;?' asked the girl scornfully. 'You
are getting polite in your old age, Mike.'</p>

<p>'Miss Westhanger,' he repeated suavely.</p>

<p>'Suppose I refuse to be searched?'</p>

<p>'Then I shall convey you to a vulgar police station,' said
Michael, 'and the process of search will be carried out in
uncongenial surroundings.'</p>

<p>'I take it that you have a warrant?' demanded Colonel
Westhanger.</p>

<p>'My dear Colonel!' said Michael, 'do you imagine I should
come without having gone through that little formality?'</p>

<p>He produced the document.</p>

<p>'Signed by two stipendiary magistrates to be absolutely
sure,' he said flippantly. 'Impound all documents you find,
Parsons.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the man, and led away the first of his
victims, which happened to be the docile Mr. Mulberry.</p>

<p>'It is an unpleasant business,' sighed Michael, as he watched
the girl pass from the room, followed by her searcher; 'but
then, you will understand, Colonel, that our profession is full
of heartrending moments. You are still on ticket of leave, I
understand?'</p>

<p>'Expired,' growled Colonel Westhanger.</p>

<p>'Pardon me,' said Michael, 'I have been misinformed. I would
like a word with you.'</p>

<p>He led the other to the corner of the room out of earshot,
and the good humour died out of his voice as he confronted the
older man.</p>

<p>'Westhanger,' he said, 'who was the tutor of this girl?'</p>

<p>'I don't quite get you.' said the other insolently.</p>

<p>'Who taught Kate to be a thief&mdash;is that plain enough
for you?'</p>

<p>'If she is a thief, it is a matter of aptitude. I deny that
she is a thief or that she is a party to any illegal act of
which my unfortunate friends may have been guilty&mdash;nobody
taught her.'</p>

<p>'You are a queer fellow,' said Michael. 'I suppose you are
just unmoral.'</p>

<p>'My personal character&mdash;' began the other.</p>

<p>'By unmoral I mean you have no sense of meum and tuum. In
other words, you are a born thief. You forgive me, but subtlety
seems to be wasted on you. I ask you again, who educated
Kate?'</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled.</p>

<p>'Kate has much to thank me for,' he said smugly. 'I have been
a father, and more than a father, to that child, and I assure
you, Mr. Pretherston, that you are altogether wrong when you
think that she is a thief. Why do you ask?' he demanded,
suddenly breaking off.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Michael, looking him steadily in the eye, 'I
believe that you have deliberately set yourself to exploit the
genius of a clever child for your own profit. I believe that
you, and you only, have so distorted her viewpoint that you have
destroyed her soul. I am not sure yet,' he admitted, 'but when I
am&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When you are,' sneered the Colonel.</p>

<p>'On one charge or another, I shall put you into prison,' said
Michael simply, 'and I shall keep you in prison until you are
dead. I will set myself the agreeable task of ensuring your end
in a prison infirmary&mdash;which, I understand, is not a very
cheerful place.'</p>

<p>The Colonel shuddered. There was something fateful, there was
something malignant, a scarcely suppressed expression of hate in
the police officer's tone. For a second the older man wilted and
shrunk back beneath the fierce intensity in Michael's voice, and
then, like the weakling that he was, he burst into a torrent of
abuse which was founded in fear and energized by rage.</p>

<p>'Hang you,' he hissed, 'threaten me...! I will have your
coat off your back, you rotten policeman...! You sneaking
slop...! Kate is what she is. She will beat you and all
your flat-footed pals! If she's bad, you can't make her anything
else. I made her; yes, I made her! She is going to beat you, do
you hear, and you will never catch her or me. I made her! You
can't scare me!'</p>

<p>His shrill voice trembled with anger; he was shaking from
head to foot, and the bony fist which shivered in Michael's face
was so tightly clenched that the knuckles stood out whitely.</p>

<p>'She is not the kind you can cure with psalms, Mr. Policeman!
You can't pray over her because she has nothing to pray to, do
you hear that? You caught me. You sent me to that hell at
Wandsworth, and I am going to get back on you, you and all
people like you. Kate's the biggest thing you have handled, and
she is going to break you, break you!'</p>

<p>'Uncle!'</p>

<p>He turned round to meet the white face of the girl.</p>

<p>'Are you mad?' she asked quietly.</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes before hers.</p>

<p>'He got me rattled,' he muttered.</p>

<p>Michael looked at the searcher, and the woman shook her head.
With a nod he dismissed her.</p>

<p>'Not guilty!' he said flippantly.</p>

<p>He looked at the trembling man in front of him with a calm
intensity.</p>

<p>'I shall remember a lot of what you said, Westhanger, and you
will hear from me one of these days.'</p>

<p>He walked over to the fireplace, for out of the tail of his
eye he had seen the burnt paper. He thrust a finger gently
through the ash.</p>

<p>'Still warm,' he said. 'I gather we were a little late.'</p>

<p>He scooped out a handful of the ash, and carried it to the
light. A word or two of the burnt instructions was still faintly
visible, but there was nothing to assist him. Nevertheless he
had the whole of the ashes carefully deposited in a box and
carried away&mdash;he himself being the last of the police to
leave.</p>

<p>He stood in the centre of the room, carefully smoothing the
nap of his felt hat, and Crime Street waited for the inevitable
warning. In this they were disappointed, for Michael addressed
himself solely to Kate.</p>

<p>'I will give you a chance, Miss Westhanger,' he said and they
wondered why he did not employ the more familiar style of
address. 'You are about to commit a crime which will render
every one of you liable to long terms of penal servitude. What
that crime is, I don't know, but I am certain it is what
Stockmar would call &ldquo;kolossal.&rdquo; It would not matter
to me if you all rotted in prison for the rest of your
lives.'</p>

<p>'Tank you,' said Mr. Stockmar, 'dat is fery goot of you!'</p>

<p>'When I say all,' said Michael, 'I exclude Kate. She is a
young girl, and if there is one of you who has any pretensions
to manhood, you will get her out of this gang before you go any
farther. If there is one of you who has a mother or a sister or
any woman in the world for whom he has the slightest respect, he
will try to save that child from herself. That is all.'</p>

<p>The meek Mr. Mulberry stood by the piano, his plump fingers
ranged across the keys producing a melancholy symphony.</p>

<p>'We will now sing Hymn 847,' he said, in his melancholy oily
voice, and it was in the burst of laughter that this sally
provoked that Michael Pretherston took his leave, followed at a
respectful distance down the stairs by Colonel Westhanger, who
did not breathe freely until the front door had clanged behind
his unwelcome visitor, and until the oiled bolts shot home in
their sockets.</p>

<p>'Where's Kate?'</p>

<p>'Such nonsense,' growled the elder Stockmar, 'she has to the
high-room gone to make scare mit Predderston.'</p>

<p>Michael, at the far end of Crime Street, was taking leave of
his assistants when there cut into the quiet night a sound
almost terrifying in its unexpectedness. It could only be
described as a hollow shriek which rose and fell from a wailing
scream to a throaty sob. It lasted no more than ten seconds and
stopped as unexpectedly as it began.</p>

<p>'What's that?' asked his startled sergeant. Michael scratched
his chin.</p>

<p>'The Colonel in hysterics,' he suggested callously.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the noise puzzled him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="first">MICHAEL took the card from the uniformed
constable, and raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p>'Sir Ralph Sapson,' he said, 'what the dickens does he
want?'</p>

<p>The constable made no reply, for he was neither
thought-reader nor inquisitive.</p>

<p>'Show him in,' said Michael.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Sapson had never before called at Scotland House,
or showed the slightest desire to improve his acquaintance with
Michael, and the visit was therefore a little puzzling. Ralph
bustled in, less important than usual, and probably somewhat
over-awed by the difficulty he had experienced in reaching his
objective.</p>

<p>'I daresay you wonder why I have called,' he said.</p>

<p>'As long as it isn't to take me out to lunch, I don't care,'
said Michael with a laugh. 'Sit down, Ralph, and tell me all
your troubles. By the way,' he said, as the thought occurred to
him, 'I suppose you are not in any kind of trouble, are
you?'</p>

<p>'That's just it, Michael,' said the other, depositing his
silk hat carefully on the ground. 'I am really worried over two
matters, and knowing what a good chap you are, and how very nice
you have been to me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't be silly,' said Michael kindly. 'I have not been nice
to you and I am not a good chap. Have you lost something?'</p>

<p>'I want to see you on two matters,' said Sir Ralph, who was
given to preambles; 'they are altogether different, and one, of
course, is not a police matter at all&mdash;I merely want your
advice as a friend. Do you know the Princess Bacheffski?'</p>

<p>'I don't know Her Royal Highness, Her Serene Highness, or Her
Nibs, as the case may be.'</p>

<p>'She is neither,' said the other; 'she is the wife of Prince
Dimitri Bacheffski, who is a large landowner in Poland.'</p>

<p>Michael shook his head. 'The world is filled with the wives
of princes who are large landowners in Poland,' he said.</p>

<p>'I met her in Paris,' exclaimed Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>'When I said the world,' said Michael, 'I meant Paris. What
has she done? Stolen your watch?'</p>

<p>'Please don't be an ass,' said the other testily. 'I tell you
she is a princess and enormously wealthy. She had a row with her
husband, came to London, and I have seen a great deal of her.
Yesterday, when I called to take her driving, I found that she
had gone away, left without a word, paid her bill at the
furnished flat she had taken and vanished&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Gone back to her husband, I suppose,' said Michael. 'I have
heard of such things happening. You will not hear from her until
a suit is filed for divorce, and then the newspapers will be
filled with grisly details, about your directorships, your early
life and your hobbies; also the Sunday papers will publish your
portrait.'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph wagged his head in despair. 'If I thought you would
have taken this kind of view, I would not have come,' he said
severely. 'There is nothing of that kind in this business. She
is just a lady whom I had helped very slightly, and who had been
kind enough to give me her confidence.'</p>

<p>'Do you want me to find her?' said the other in surprise.</p>

<p>'No, that isn't it,' said Sir Ralph. 'The story has a curious
sequel. This morning I was in the city, and I met a friend who
asked me to lunch with him. I had a lot of business to get
through, and it was not until ten to one that I was able to get
away. My car was not in the city, but I thought I should have no
difficulty in getting a taxi. When I got into the street,
however, it was pouring with rain, and not a taxi could be had
for love or money. It was only a few steps to the Bank station,
and I decided to go by tube.'</p>

<p>'Sensation!' said the admiring Michael.</p>

<p>'Well, to cut a long story short,' said Sir Ralph, 'I
travelled to Oxford Circus and changed into a train which took
me to the Thames Embankment. Here comes the extraordinary part
of the story,' he said impressively: 'As I came up the escalator
on the one side, the Princess passed down on the other.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' said Michael, unimpressed.</p>

<p>'She was plainly, even poorly dressed,' said Ralph. 'I raised
my hat to her, but she stared at me as though she had never seen
me before in her life.'</p>

<p>'You made a mistake probably,' said the other.</p>

<p>'I will swear it was she,' said Sir Ralph emphatically.
'There was no mistaking her. She has a very tiny mole just below
the right ear, which I had seen&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Eh?' Michael was all attention now. 'A tiny mole beneath the
right ear, dark grey eyes, large, well-marked eyebrows, very
delicate mouth and rounded chin?' he said.</p>

<p>'That is she. Good Lord!' cried Sir Ralph in amazement, 'do
you know her?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I know her,' said Michael grimly.</p>

<p>'Now let me hear the story of this Princess all over again.
How did you come to meet her?'</p>

<p>'I met her in Paris. She was introduced to me after the
opera,' said Sir Ralph patiently. 'As a matter of fact, I forgot
all about it until she reminded me of the fact.'</p>

<p>'Ah, this is where the story begins,' said Michael. 'When did
she remind you of the fact?'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph detailed briefly the unconventional character of
the meeting.</p>

<p>'I see,' said Michael, 'her car had broken down
providentially just outside your house. Beautiful and most
gorgeously arrayed, how could you resist her pathetic appeal?
And so that is how you met her, is it? Oh, Kate, Kate!' He shook
his head.</p>

<p>'Kate?' asked the bewildered magnate&mdash;'What on earth
are you talking about?'</p>

<p>Michael took no notice of the question. 'I must ask you to
give me a more detailed account of your meetings. Of course, you
met her afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I met her. And she was very charming,' said Sir
Ralph.</p>

<p>'And particularly interested in business?'</p>

<p>'No, she did not know much about business. There you are
wrong. You are trying to prove that she is an adventuress. She
knew nothing whatever about business,' said Sir Ralph
triumphantly; 'in fact, I had to explain things over and over
again.'</p>

<p>Michael leant over and patted his arm, as he might have done
to a distraught child. 'What things did you explain, little
man?' he asked.</p>

<p>Here, however, he lost the trail, either because Sir Ralph
could not or would not remember. He became very vague at this
point.</p>

<p>Michael sat at his desk, his head between his hands, thinking
rapidly. First Flanborough, then Boltover, and now Ralph Sapson,
what was the association?</p>

<p>'Have you any business dealings with Flanborough?' he
said.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked Ralph cautiously.</p>

<p>'Is there any connection between your companies?'</p>

<p>'My dear chap, what a question to ask,' said Sir Ralph. 'You
know, as well as I, that all business people who operate on a
big scale are associated in some way or other. I run railways
and quarries and things, and Flanborough runs ships and gold
mines. I am interested in his things, and he has shares in
mine.'</p>

<p>Being a business man he did not tell Michael of the
arrangement which he had entered into for the benefit of the
unthriving port of Seahampton, because it is the way of business
men to be mysterious and uninforming about the commonplaces of
commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>'Well, that's that,' said Michael, after waiting in vain for
some illuminating observation from his friend. 'And what is the
other matter?'</p>

<p>Here Sir Ralph found it more difficult to make a
beginning.</p>

<p>'It is rather a delicate subject, Michael,' he said, 'for it
touches my personal honour.'</p>

<p>'Dear, dear,' said Michael sympathetically, and, if the truth
be told, a little mechanically, because his mind was occupied
elsewhere with a greater and more important problem than with
the personal honour of the Sapsons.</p>

<p>'And not only that, but the honour of somebody we both
admire,' said Sir Ralph awkwardly. 'The fact is, Michael, I am
engaged to Moya. It isn't generally known, but it is so, and
naturally I haven't seen as much of her as I could have wished
in the past week. Also I have been a very busy man.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Michael sympathetically. 'You have already
told me about the Princess, you remember.'</p>

<p>'Well, you are a man of the world,' said Sir Ralph, going
very red, 'and you will understand. Anyway, I haven't seen as
much of Moya as I could have wished. The fact is,' he blurted
out, 'Moya is carrying on!'</p>

<p>'Carrying on,' said the puzzled Michael; 'carrying on what,
or whom?'</p>

<p>'She meets him every day in the park, and they go sketching
together in the country,' said Sir Ralph rapidly. 'I haven't
spoken to Flanborough about it, but it is all rather
rotten.'</p>

<p>'If by &ldquo;carrying on&rdquo; you mean that Moya is
indulging in a flirtation, it is not only very rotten, but it
must have been very awkward for you,' said Michael. 'Unless you
could be perfectly certain of your fiancée's movements, you and
your Princess were liable at any moment to run against her. It
was very inconsiderate of Moya. Who is her friend?'</p>

<p>'A beastly artist,' said Ralph savagely, 'a man who had an
exhibition of simply rotten pictures. I don't think he has a bob
in the world, and he's a most untidy looking person. I have seen
them together with my own eyes and he treats Moya outrageously.
And Moya seems to like it.'</p>

<p>'Does he beat her or anything?' asked Michael wearily. He was
growing tired of the interview, and wanted to be alone to work
out the new combinations which had been presented to him.</p>

<p>'He compromises her,' said Ralph with vehemence, 'holds her
hand and calls her &ldquo;child&rdquo; in public. It is simply
disgraceful!'</p>

<p>'You can trust Moya,' said Michael; 'she will do nothing
which jeopardizes her prospects.'</p>

<p>'She has plenty of money of her own,' interrupted Ralph.</p>

<p>'It is curious how your mind runs to money. I wasn't thinking
of that. I was thinking of her social prospects. She is a very
shrewd girl. A little romance will do her no harm, Ralph.'</p>

<p>'But, hang it, she's got me!' said Ralph wrathfully.</p>

<p>'I said &ldquo;romance&rdquo;,' said Michael with offensive
emphasis. 'You're not &ldquo;romance,&rdquo; you're
&ldquo;business&rdquo;.'</p>

<p>But Sir Ralph was not satisfied.</p>

<p>'Perhaps if you saw her and had a few words with her,' he
suggested, 'she might take a little notice.'</p>

<p>'I should leave her presence a mental and physical wreck,'
said Michael decidedly. 'No, Ralph, you must manage your own
love-making without calling in the&mdash;er&mdash;police.' (Sir
Ralph winced.) 'I don't know Moya well enough to give her advice
on so delicate a matter&mdash;I only proposed to her once, and
that has given me no right to urge your suit. One question I
should like to ask you before you go,' he said, as Sir Ralph
gathered up his hat and gloves; 'did the Princess question you
about any bank with which you are associated?'</p>

<p>'I can answer you definitely, that she did not,' replied Sir
Ralph. 'You have an altogether wrong impression of that
lady&mdash;in my judgment.'</p>

<p>'Your judgment!' said Michael scornfully, as he ushered him
out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a greater reason for Sir Ralph's
perturbation than either he knew or Michael guessed. Both might
have been enlightened, had they stood on Cannon Street Station
one Sunday morning and seen the distress of Mr. Alphonso Blaxton
as the big minute hand of the station clock grew nearer to nine.
The guard was closing the doors of the carriages and the
collector was preparing to shut the gate, when Moya came flying
breathlessly through the barrier.</p>

<p>'Oh, I am so sorry!' she gasped, 'my watch had stopped.'</p>

<p>Mr. Alphonso Blaxton bundled her into an empty first-class
carriage, and jumped in himself as the train moved.</p>

<p>'There's not another train for three hours,' he said
severely.</p>

<p>'We could have gone to church.'</p>

<p>'What a mind!' said the young man in admiration. 'I never
thought of church!'</p>

<p>'Anyway, I didn't lose the train,' she said tartly. 'Have you
brought everything?'</p>

<p>She looked round for the collapsible easel, the paint boxes
and the paraphernalia which usually accompanied their sketching
tours.</p>

<p>'I have brought nothing,' he said frankly.</p>

<p>'But how can you sketch?'</p>

<p>'I am not going to sketch,' he said. 'I decided that it was
too nice a day to waste.'</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and laughed.</p>

<p>'You will never be an artist,' she said, suddenly severe. 'To
what part of the country are we going?'</p>

<p>'I thought we would go to Maidmore. There are some lovely
drives from there. I've hired a motor-car to meet us at the
station, and I thought we would go through Sussex and lunch at
Seahampton.'</p>

<p>'Not Seahampton,' she said quickly. 'My father is at
Seahampton today.'</p>

<p>She might have added that Sir Ralph was also at Seahampton,
but, for reasons of her own, she kept that information to
herself, because Sir Ralph was not a subject which she had found
it necessary to discuss. She looked at her companion
approvingly.</p>

<p>'You are ever so much more presentable than I have ever seen
you before,' she said, 'and you have actually shaved! You are
getting less and less like an artist every day.'</p>

<p>He had a peculiarly sweet smile, and a laugh which was all
bubbling youth and happiness. He laughed like a girl, indeed it
nearly approached a giggle. He laughed now as the train sped
through the suburban stations, stretched out his feet on the
cushions opposite, and searched for a cigarette. She watched him
with glee as he produced, not the ornate case in which the men
of her acquaintances carried the expensive products of Egypt and
Syria, but a gaudy yellow carton containing fifty of the
cheapest cigarettes that ever brought credit to the fair State
of Virginia.</p>

<p>'Do you like those things?' she asked.</p>

<p>'These &ldquo;yellow perils&rdquo;? Rather!'</p>

<p>'Your taste is awfully uncultivated, isn't it?' she bantered.
'Why don't you&mdash;' She abruptly attempted to change the
subject by an incoherent reference to a cow which was grazing in
a field by the side of the line.</p>

<p>'Why don't I smoke gold-laced Machinopolos through an amber
and diamond cigarette holder?' he suggested. 'Because, little
Moya, I am a poor hard-working artist who has been saving up all
the week for this bust.'</p>

<p>'I am so sorry,' she said. 'I am awfully thoughtless. Won't
you forgive me?'</p>

<p>'I won't forgive you,' he said, 'unless you keep in your mind
the big fact that I am as immensely poor as you are immensely
rich.'</p>

<p>'Why should I keep that in my mind?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Because,' he said slowly, 'until you are immensely poor or I
am immensely rich we shall meet very occasionally and indulge in
very infrequent busts.'</p>

<p>'But what difference does money make?' she faltered. She
found it difficult to speak plainly or even clearly. There was a
lump in her throat which made her voice sound unnaturally
hoarse. She had a strange sinking feeling within her, and to her
amazement she found the hand that she put up to brush back a
stray curl trembling. She had never experienced any such
sensation before. Her heart was thumping quickly; she was
breathless, hot and cold by turns.</p>

<p>He did not answer. She was seated by his side, and she could
only see his face out of the corner of her eyes; then she felt
his arm slipping about her, and before she knew what had
happened, his lips were pressed to hers. This happened in a
first-class railway carriage on a non-stop train. It had
happened before to quite common people (as Moya had heard), but
she never thought it would possibly happen to her, or that so
vulgar a proceeding could be so wonderfully sweet.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SIR RALPH and Lord Flanborough had met the
local authorities. There had been a lunch and speeches in which
Sir Ralph had distinguished himself by likening the forthcoming
arrival of the Austral-African mail ship to the return of
Ulysses and the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. A wireless
message from the ship stated that she did not expect to make
harbour until nine o'clock in the evening, and this explained
the earlier festivities. That they were of a sober and
restricted nature was explained by the fact that the day was
Sunday. Later, it was intended that the sailings of the
Austral-African line from Cape Town should be timed to bring the
ships to port on the Saturday; but there had been no time to
alter the arrangements, for the Charter Queen had sailed before
Lord Flanborough and Sir Ralph had definitely decided the date
on which the new service should be inaugurated.</p>

<p>A few pressmen who had come down from London for the purpose,
with certain directors and their wives, were shown over the
docks; the new trains were admired, and particularly two
brand-new trucks, the peculiar character of which was exhibited
by Sir Ralph to a select few of his fellow-directors. A safe on
wheels was an excellent description for one of these. Specially
strengthened under-carriages, each truck supported by two
bogies, they were designed to carry a tremendous weight.</p>

<p>'I am sure Lord Flanborough doesn't mind my telling you,'
said Sir Ralph to the little party, 'that this will carry twenty
tons of bar gold tonight.'</p>

<p>'What will be the value of that?' asked one of the interested
audience.</p>

<p>'£2,867,200,' said Sir Ralph impressively, 'representing six
months' output of the whole of Lord Flanborough's gold
properties.'</p>

<p>The directors made appropriate noises to signify their
astonishment.</p>

<p>There were visitors to Seahampton interested in this great
transportation who were not invited to participate in the
function. One of these, a dark, foreign-looking man, went no
nearer to the docks than a little public house in the ancient
High Street. He was visited by a man who was pallid of face and
laconic of speech.</p>

<p>'It's all up!' he said under his breath.</p>

<p>'What is wrong?' said the other in the same tone.</p>

<p>'It is quite impossible to get the driver or the fireman.
They are two old servants of the company, both have money saved,
and would no more think of accepting a bribe than Flanborough
himself.'</p>

<p>'You didn't press the matter, I hope?' asked the other
quickly.</p>

<p>The pallid man shook his head.</p>

<p>'I went as far as I dared with the driver,' he said. 'I found
out he had a son in the army in India, and I told him that I had
met the boy, and got quite friendly with the old chap; but he is
a sea-green incorruptible, Gregori.'</p>

<p>'I will get on the'phone to Kate,' said the other. 'I suppose
we shall have to hold up the train somewhere&mdash;I don't
want to do any shooting if it can be avoided. Are the drivers
armed?'</p>

<p>'It is funny you should ask that,' said the pallid man,
sipping his beer. 'The old man is armed for the first time in
his life. He was full of it, and quite proud of his ability to
loose off a gun.'</p>

<p>Gregori looked very serious.</p>

<p>'Kate must be prepared with the alternative scheme,' he said;
'anyway, you will join me here with Cunningham at eight o'clock.
I am perfectly prepared for almost all contingencies. Millet has
given me a dozen authorities to meet almost any developments.
Did you see the train?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't get near it,' said the other. 'I left just before
Sapson brought his party to make their inspection.'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph had carried his guests from the siding to the
engine shed and shown them the brand-new Atlantic locomotive
which was to draw the train to London.</p>

<p>'They don't seem to have finished it yet,' said one of the
guests, and pointed to a workman busily drilling a hole in the
front plate.</p>

<p>Ralph laughed.</p>

<p>'They omitted to put a bracket for the lamp. You see, I
wanted three green lights in a line for the gold train&mdash;
it is very necessary that it should be very accurately and
easily distinguished and signalled. By some chance only two of
the brackets were in place when the engine came from the works.
It is all the more annoying, because I had already given
definite instructions upon that point; but we shall not go wrong
for a lamp,' he said humorously.</p>

<p>It is agreed that the three hours between two and five on a
Sunday afternoon are the three dullest in the hundred and
sixty-eight which constitute a week. After the guests had left
for London, Sir Ralph and Lord Flanborough remained at the little
station hotel&mdash;Ralph had already projected a more
palatial establishment to meet the increased traffic&mdash;for
it had been arranged that they should greet the Charter Queen on
her arrival.</p>

<p>At three o'clock that afternoon Ralph burst unceremoniously
into Lord Flanborough's sitting-room where his lordship sat
dozing.</p>

<p>'Have you had a wire?' he said. He held a pink form in his
own hand.</p>

<p>'A wire! What about?' asked Lord Flanborough, startled.</p>

<p>'Read this.'</p>

<p>The telegram was signed 'Michael' and ran&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">SIMULTANEOUS ATTEMPT MADE TO BURGLE YOUR
STRONG ROOM AT AUSTRAL-AFRICAN OFFICE AND FLANBOROUGH'S SAFE AT
HEADQUARTERS OF MINING CORPORATION. BOTH UNSUCCESSFUL. BOTH
DOORS BLOWN OUT BY NITRO-GELATINE. WILL CONFIRM BY PHONE.</p>

<br>

<p>Lord Flanborough looked at the other open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'This is very serious,' he said. 'I have ordered a special to
take us to town. We will wait till we get the 'phone message
through.'</p>

<p>Ten minutes after they were in communication with
Michael.</p>

<p>'Both doors have been blown out,' he repeated, 'and there are
one or two very puzzling features about the burglaries. Nobody
could have been present in either office when the explosions
occurred. There was no fire, and, so far as I can see, nothing
has been taken away. You had better come up and examine them for
yourself.'</p>

<p>'It is rather awkward,' said Sir Ralph thoughtfully, as
he hung up the receiver. 'My &ldquo;special&rdquo; driver is
also the driver of the gold special.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't require any great genius to drive a gold
special,' snapped Flanborough. 'Put another man on to work
tonight's train and let us get up to town as soon as we
can.'</p>

<p>The special was waiting in the station by the time they had
reached the platform. Sir Ralph stayed long enough to give a few
instructions to the superintendent, and then boarded the train
and was soon flying northward.</p>

<p>That Sunday morning had been an interesting one for
Michael.</p>

<p>He had been aroused by telephone at five o'clock only to
learn from an apologetic operator that the wrong number had been
called. Although it was two hours before he usually rose, he had
his bath and dressed and without waking his servants made
himself some coffee.</p>

<p>It was a bright morning, such as so often precedes a day of
rain, when he turned into the deserted street. He had no
particular aim or destination, but he was in that mood which
invites exercise. He walked along the Marylebone Road and
through Portland Place without meeting anybody save an
occasional policeman, and so came to Piccadilly Circus, where he
bought a Sunday newspaper from an early vendor and passed down
through Waterloo Place to the Park.</p>

<p>The gates had only just been opened, and beyond the
park-keepers and a slouching tramp he met nobody. He sat on one
of the garden seats by the side of the lake, pulled his overcoat
about his legs, for the morning was chilly, and began to scan
the headlines in the newspaper. There was nothing startling
here, but he read the columns conscientiously.</p>

<p>There was nothing in life which did not interest Michael
Pretherston. He, also, might have taken for his motto, homo sum;
humani nihil a me alienum puto. It was a saying of T.B. Smith's
that Michael could even write a readable volume on the
psychology of dog-fights. Every little larceny however sordid,
every tiny embezzlement however paltry, every swindle whether it
was carried out by the great confidence men who 'worked London',
or by the smaller fry in the half-crown line of business, gave
him food for reflection and some little scrap of information
which he stored away for future use.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of a long account of an East End arson
charge, when he heard his name called softly and looked up. He
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>'Why, Kate,' he said, 'haven't you got any home?'</p>

<p>The girl was standing a few feet from him with an odd look on
her face.</p>

<p>'I think it must be fate that brought me out this morning,'
she said. 'Sit down, Mike, and tell me all the news.'</p>

<p>She showed no sign of resentment of his uncavalier
treatment.</p>

<p>'Did you follow me here, or did I follow you?'</p>

<p>'I tell you it was fate,' she said. 'I could not sleep and I
drove my Mercedes down.'</p>

<p>'And how is the Princess Bacheffski?' he asked, as she seated
herself by his side.</p>

<p>'The Princess&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Bacheffski&mdash;poor old Ralph! What a thing to put over
him!'</p>

<p>She leant forward, her chin on her palm, her elbow on her
crossed knee.</p>

<p>'You frighten me sometimes,' she said. 'I have not been able
to make up my mind whether you are clever, or whether you are
lucky.'</p>

<p>'I am both lucky and clever,' he said. 'Tell me something
about your property in the Ural Mountains,' he said.</p>

<p>'In Poland,' she corrected him.</p>

<p>'Mines, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'There are no mines on my property,' she said calmly. 'Would
you be greatly surprised if I told you I had an estate in
Poland?'</p>

<p>'Nothing you said would surprise me, unless you told me you
were going to be a good girl and respect the law relating to
property.' He folded his paper and dropped it into a wire
receptacle provided for that purpose, and she followed the
operations with amusement.</p>

<p>'What a tidy soul you are,' she said. 'Fancy doing things you
are told, and obeying even by-laws.'</p>

<p>'We all obey by-laws. You are not so original as you think.
For instance, I observe that your dress is very short. You are
not wearing a Roman toga or a Grecian gown. Why? Because it is
against the by-laws. It is absurd to disobey one set and
slavishly obey another.'</p>

<p>'You are quaint!' was the only answer she gave.</p>

<p>'Will you tell me, Princess&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Don't call me &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; if you please,' she
said quietly.</p>

<p>'Well, will you tell me, my landowner, what was the game with
Ralph? He described you with the greatest enthusiasm by the way.
The night you met him you were all dolled up to kill. Did you
bring down your birds?'</p>

<p>'I got him,' she admitted.</p>

<p>She was not as bright as usual, he thought, and said as much.
'You are over-doing it; you are trying yourself too highly. Your
doctor would probably tell you that you ought not to commit more
than one burglary a month.'</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>'You are very quaint,' she said again.</p>

<p>'You don't feel like making a full and frank confession, I
suppose?' he suggested. 'You would not like to burst into tears
and sob out your young heart on my shoulder?'</p>

<p>'That sob stuff never did agree with me.'</p>

<p>He raised a disapproving hand.</p>

<p>'Kate,' he said, 'I have noticed a disposition in you to
adopt the slang which is employed exclusively by American
Newspaper reporters, vaudeville artistes, and other members of
the criminal classes.'</p>

<p>'I will tell you this,' she said, sitting upright and looking
him fully in the face; 'we are going to do a big thing. The most
colossal, the most daring that has ever been done, and we are
going to do it today. You want to know why I went to
Flanborough's, why I made up to that unspeakable person, Ralph
Sapson? Those are my two victims. I will tell you more than
this,' she said after a moment's thought; 'in order to ensure
the success of my scheme, I have arranged for those two
gentlemen to be out of London on this bright Sabbath day. I
can't tell you any more, Mike.'</p>

<p>'You are like a serial story; you finish at the most
interesting place,' he grumbled.</p>

<p>His keen grey eyes searched hers, and she met them
fairly.</p>

<p>'I wish you weren't,' he said.</p>

<p>'Weren't what?' she asked.</p>

<p>'In this business,' he nodded. 'I wish you weren't.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I will be good one of these days,' she said, 'and
then you can recommend me for a job at two-ten-per. I'd make an
ideal secretary for you, Mike; I know all the underworld by
name. You could cut out your finger-print department, and leave
it to Kate. What would happen, do you think?' she went on, 'if I
went to a Salvation Army officer and said, &ldquo;I have been
very wicked, but now I am going to be good. Will you please
assist me? I have no money, but I've a good heart&mdash;&rdquo;
Mike, he would put me to chopping wood for a week, and then he
would find me a place as under-secretary to a housemaid in a
strictly religious family which gave me two evenings and one
Sunday a month. You see, Mike, even at goodliness one has to
start at the bottom of the ladder; you can't break in on the
roof. I hate good people.'</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>'I hate good people, too,' he said, 'if they advertise their
goodness; but goodness is not hardness or sourness, it is just
&mdash;goodness. For example,' he went on, 'I am good.'</p>

<p>'And I am wicked,' she said, and appealed with outstretched
hands to a startled duck which had waddled to the railings,
'choose between us!'</p>

<p>He laughed, but was instantly serious again. 'Your confession
puts me in a dilemma. As you are a lady, I cannot believe you
are lying; as you are a criminal, I dare not take your word. I
am sufficiently acquainted with your methods to know that your
presence is not essential to the commission of a crime, so I can
gain nothing by pulling you in.'</p>

<p>'Poor Mike,' she said mockingly.</p>

<p>'Poor Kate,' he said, but the girl detected the note of
sincerity in his voice. 'Kate, you can't get away with it,' he
said; 'you have got to fall sooner or later. Think what it
means. Think of that horrible drab life in Aylesbury, where
every minute is an hour and every hour an eternity. Think of the
menial things they will set you to do&mdash;scrubbing floors,
washing shirts and sewing sacks. Think how you will be
marshalled to church every Sunday, and think how you will be
stared at and jeered at by friends of the Home Secretary who
come to visit the gaol.'</p>

<p>'When that happens I shall be dead,' she said. 'I believe you
mean kindly, Michael Pretherston, and I will tell you this, that
neither you nor any other human being can make me think or feel
any different to what I think and feel. There is no power on
earth that can tear out the foundations on which my life is
built. I have read everything, all the philosophies, Christian
and pagan, and all the arguments from the feeble evangelism of
the tract writer to the blatant nonsense of the professional
atheist; and I am just where I began. You can't touch me by
reason or by devotion, by faith or by prayers. I am all stone
&mdash;here.'</p>

<p>She laid her white hand upon her bosom and he saw the mocking
laughter in her eyes.</p>

<p>'Poor Michael!' she said; 'why, if devotion could change me,
think of the chances I have had! I could have taken Ralph
Sapson, and made of him a snake ring for my little finger. I
nearly had Flanborough on the point of proposing to me. He is
rather sentimental, did you know that?'</p>

<p>'All people with indigestion are sentimental between
paroxysms,' said Michael sagely. He gave his hand to the girl,
though it was unnecessary, and helped her to her feet, and they
walked out of the park together. Her little Mercedes was
unattended, and he cranked it up for her.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Michael,' she said, 'Au revoir,' said Michael, 'we
shall meet at the sessions.'</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT two o'clock that afternoon a constable on
duty in Moorgate Street heard the first of the two explosions
which agitated police circles that day. Michael was on the spot
half an hour later, and his brief examination led to the view
which he afterwards communicated to Ralph. It was then he
discovered that what the girl had told him was true, and that
both Lord Flanborough and Sir Ralph Sapson were out of town.
Curiously enough, though he had been impressed at the time, he
had dismissed the girl's statement as a piece of bravado on a
par with the badinage in which she usually indulged. He had
cursed his folly in ignoring the warning all the way from Baker
Street to the city, and it was a great relief to discover what
was evident, that no attempt had been made to rifle either the
safe in Bartholomew Close or the strong room in Moorgate Street.
The outrages were similar in character; in both cases the steel
doors had been burst open by the application of an infernal
machine. In neither case had the thieves benefited by their
crime. The constable who heard the first explosion said he had
been admitted by the caretaker of the building within three
minutes, but in that time he managed to send another policeman
who came up, to guard the back of the premises. Nobody had
either entered or left the building in that period.</p>

<p>The explosion in Bartholomew Close had blown a skylight into
the street. The safe was in a concrete cellar in which a light
had been burning day and night, and although this had been
extinguished by the force of the explosion, it was possible for
the constable who was outside to see the safe and secure a
fairly comprehensive view of the chamber. He, too, had asserted
that nobody had entered the room or left the building after the
explosion.</p>

<p>'It is very curious,' said Michael.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith had come at his urgent request, and the chief was
as puzzled as his subordinate. 'Did Flanborough say he would
come up?'</p>

<p>'He is on his way now,' replied Michael.</p>

<p>'Do you know what I think?' said T.B. after a moment's
thought, 'I think that this is a blind. That there was never any
intention of rifling either the strong room or the safe. There
is a big move on somewhere; Mike, call in all the reserves.'</p>

<p>This was an order which Michael heard with pleasure, for he
had already anticipated these instructions, and detectives were
at that moment flocking to Scotland Yard from every point of the
compass.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHATEVER distress animated the bosoms of
humanity on that fateful Sunday afternoon and evening, there
were two people riotously and supremely happy, though the car
which Alphonso Blaxton drove was an old one and badly sprung,
and though every hill it met reduced the two young adventurers
to breathless apprehension, for the car had a trick of stopping
with its goal in sight, and refusing to budge any farther.</p>

<p>They were happy, though no word of love had been spoken
between them from the moment she had drawn from his arms. And
their happiness was such that even a faulty cylinder and a
choked carburettor were matters of little moment.</p>

<p>They had eaten a very bad luncheon in Maidmore without
noticing the fact. They had encountered perils innumerable (the
steering gear had gone wrong, and temporary repairs had to be
effected without the aid of a tool chest), and were yet
cheerful. They had been bumped and shaken and jarred, but they
had had compensation. They had seen the uprising ridges of the
Kentish Rag, green and white, and starred with flowers. They had
looked through a golden haze across mysterious valleys. They had
heard the songs of birds, and had tasted the joys which come
only to those who love youth and young things.</p>

<p>If the clouds were banking up in the west and an occasional
puff of cold wind came to remind them of May's treachery, they,
for their part, saw no cloud in their sky, felt no chill winds
in their rosy world.</p>

<p>They reached the top of a particularly trying hill, and
Alphonso stopped the car and got down. Before them the road
dipped straightly down to a level crossing. A mile beyond the
railway there was a little hill which promised no distress of
mind.</p>

<p>'Wouldn't this be a lovely place to paint?' said the
girl.</p>

<p>'Don't let's talk about art,' he begged with a wry face. 'Let
us talk of beautiful things&mdash;such as tea and shrimps.'
She shrieked with merriment at his feeble jest.</p>

<p>'I wonder what is going to happen,' said the girl, becoming
grave.</p>

<p>'Happen, how, where?' he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'About us,' she said.</p>

<p>He took her two hands in his. 'I am going to be tremendously
rich.'</p>

<p>'Did I tell you I was engaged?' she asked timidly after a
long silence. It was nothing less than an act of heroism for her
to ask this question.</p>

<p>'I have a dim idea you said something about it a long time
ago,' he said.</p>

<p>'Did I really?' she asked, relieved. 'I had a
feeling&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You didn't tell me, I saw your ring,' he said, and she went
red because she had removed that ring after their second
meeting, and had never worn it again.</p>

<p>'I think I told you that I had £300 a year,' he went on. 'Now
that we are confessing our handicaps, I might as well own up to
mine.'</p>

<p>'You told me you were absolutely penniless,' she said
severely; '£300 a year is a fortune.'</p>

<p>'£300 a year is only a fortune to the immensely rich, to the
poor it is worse than poverty.'</p>

<p>'You can do a lot with £300 a year,' she said thoughtfully,
'and what shall I do with my money? I can't throw it away.'</p>

<p>'You will do nothing with it,' he said firmly. 'When my £300
a year has become £10,000 a year, we can do things.' She laughed
happily, twisting his watch-guard round her finger.</p>

<p>'I cannot understand myself,' she said. 'I have been such a
selfish mercenary pig. I didn't know there was any happiness in
the world.'</p>

<p>For the second time that day he slipped his arm around her,
raised her face to his and kissed her.</p>

<p>'Tea,' he said practically, started the engine and climbed
into the driver's seat, stretching out his hand to assist her to
his side. The car started with a jerk, but ran smoothly down the
hill.</p>

<p>'It is rather lucky that gate is open,' he said, as the
machine gathered speed; 'it would be rather comic if we couldn't
stop the car.'</p>

<p>A piercing shriek of an engine brought his head round.</p>

<p>'That must be another line,' he said uneasily and put his
hand on the brake; 'anyway, the gate is open,' he said,
relieved.</p>

<p>Again came the frenzied scream of the engine and he heard the
thunder of its wheels. He was fifty yards from the crossing when
he saw the gates begin to move. He pressed on the footbrake
without any diminution of speed, gripped the handbrake, pulled
it back until he felt the snap of the rotten handle as it broke.
There was nothing for it but to take a risk. He pushed over the
accelerator and the car leapt forward ...</p>

<p>Car and gate and train seemed to reach the spot
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The girl found herself flung headlong into a ditch,
fortunately landing in the soft mud at the bottom. Alphonso's
fall was broken by the quick-set hedge, which ripped his clothes
to ribbons and scarred his face and hands. He picked himself up
and went in search of the girl and found her as she was climbing
unsteadily on to the permanent way.</p>

<p>The train had pulled up with a jerk amidst a chaos of smashed
gate and mangled motor-car. Fortunately, it was slowing at the
closed gate at the time the collision occurred, otherwise these
two young people presenting a fantastic appearance might have
ended their promising careers.</p>

<p>'Are you hurt?' were the first words she asked. His face was
scratched and his clothes were torn, but though he had by far
the worst experience, his was not the woebegone appearance which
the girl presented. She was caked with mud, a dab of mud was on
her cheek, her hat was gone, and her long brown hair was flying
in all directions.</p>

<p>The passengers of the 'special' were perhaps more perturbed
than its victims.</p>

<p>'It is an accident. We have run into a motor-car,' reported
the conductor.</p>

<p>'Is anybody killed?' asked Sir Ralph in alarm.</p>

<p>'No, sir, a young man and a young woman who are more
frightened than hurt.'</p>

<p>'Let us go and look at them,' said Lord Flanborough, and
stepped down to the permanent way. It is a truism that there is
no such thing as a paternal instinct, and he would have indeed
been a wise father who recognized his child in such disarray. He
was speechless for a moment.</p>

<p>'Moya!' he gasped hollowly, 'Moya! Great heavens! What were
you doing here?'</p>

<p>He stared round at the scarecrow by her side, and at sight of
the young man, Sir Ralph, who had been struck dumb by the
apparition, found his voice.</p>

<p>'I see, I see,' he said bitterly.</p>

<p>'You have the advantage of me,' said the young man, 'for I
have got a little piece of Hampshire in my eye.'</p>

<p>The girl swung round to him, fumbling for her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>'It is nothing, dear,' said the young man, blissfully
unconscious of the identity of the well-fed gentleman who was
regarding him so sternly.</p>

<p>'But, darling, you might be blinded,' pleaded the girl.
'Please let me.'</p>

<p>'Moya,' said Lord Flanborough in a pained tone, 'may I ask
what is the meaning of this?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I want you to meet Mr. Blaxton,' said the girl, going
red and white. 'Fonso, this is papa.'</p>

<p>'I should be glad to see you,' said Fonso, groping wildly on
the blind side of him.</p>

<p>'&rdquo;Fonso&rdquo;?' repeated the enraged Flanborough; 'and
who, may I ask, is Fonso?'</p>

<p>She fastened back her unruly hair and rubbed her mud stained
cheek with her handkerchief before she replied. 'I suppose it
will come as a shock to you and a greater shock to Sir Ralph,
but Fonso and I are going to be married,' she said.</p>

<p>Alphonso Baxton blinked at her.</p>

<p>'I haven't asked you yet,' he said.</p>

<p>'That doesn't matter,' she replied calmly. 'You do want me,
don't you?' and before her horrified father and her promised
husband, Alphonso took her in his arms and hugged her.</p>

<p>It was an awkward journey back to town. Sir Ralph sat by
himself and rejected all Lord Flanborough's attempts to discuss
the matter. He was hurt in his pride, and if the truth be told,
hurt in his pocket, because an alliance with the family meant a
considerable addition to his fortune. It is a mistake to believe
that rich people do not care for money, or that a man with two
millions is wholly indifferent as to whether he has two or
three. Indeed, the reverse is the case. The man who thinks in
thousands is indifferent to a figure or two, the man who counts
his fortune in shillings seldom knows the number of shillings he
has.</p>

<p>Only your two-millionaire reaches the full value of money.
The thrift of the millionaire might well serve as an example to
the improvident poor.</p>

<p>'I shall speak to Moya when we get home,' said Lord
Flanborough. 'I have never been so distressed at anything so
much in my life. It is disgraceful, Ralph.'</p>

<p>But Ralph did not encourage sympathy. As a matter of fact,
his lordship spoke to the girl before the special ran into the
terminus. It required some courage on his part, for it meant
intruding upon the couple in the little state-room which
ordinarily served as a sleeping apartment when Sir Ralph's
private coach carried him on night journeys.</p>

<p>He found them a picture of decorum, sitting rigidly bolt
upright, one on either side of the carriage, looking out of the
window with fine unconcern; but this attitude was probably due
to the fact that the door of the compartment made a very loud
rattling noise when the handle was turned.</p>

<p>'I want to speak to you alone, Moya.'</p>

<p>'Run away, Fonso,' said the girl with a gaiety out of harmony
with her rigidity of attitude.</p>

<p>Alphonso stepped out of the saloon and closed the sliding
door behind him.</p>

<p>'Now, Moya,' said his lordship with a badly simulated air of
friendliness, 'perhaps you will explain?'</p>

<p>'Why I am going to marry Fonso?' she asked. 'Because I love
him. Why do you think that I should be marrying him?'</p>

<p>'This sounds very much like Michael. It is the way he would
talk,' said Lord Flanborough bitterly. 'This shows the danger of
letting your children associate with irregular people. You know
very well that you are engaged to Sir Ralph.'</p>

<p>'I know he gave me a ring and we agreed to get married,' she
said, 'but I have changed my mind.'</p>

<p>'But you can't change your mind,' stormed her father; 'it is
impossible that my daughter should marry a wretched artist.'</p>

<p>'He's not wretched, and he is not an artist,' said the girl.
'We have both agreed that he is not an artist, and he is going
to find something useful to do.'</p>

<p>'If you marry this man'&mdash;he pointed a trembling finger
at her&mdash;'I will not receive you as my daughter.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to be received at all. You married whom you
wanted to marry, didn't you?'</p>

<p>'I married,' said Lord Flanborough virtuously, 'in accordance
with the wishes of my parents.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say,' said the girl incredulously, 'that you
had no voice in it? I cannot imagine it. My dear Daddy, it is
preposterous to suggest that a person of your strong character
accepted the wife that somebody else found for him!'</p>

<p>'Well, I admit,' said her father, somewhat mollified, 'that I
had a say in the matter, but I had the sense to choose the right
person.'</p>

<p>'That is just what I am doing,' she cried in triumph,
'choosing the right person! And, Daddy, if you are rude to
Fonso, I shall be very rude to Ralph.'</p>

<p>'The man of course is a fortune hunter,' said Lord
Flanborough savagely. 'He knows that you have money in your own
right, and that I cannot save you from the consequence of your
folly.'</p>

<p>'What is Ralph getting with me?' she said tartly.</p>

<p>'Sir Ralph is a very rich man,' said her father with
emphasis.</p>

<p>'What does he get?' she asked again.</p>

<p>This was a question which Lord Flanborough did not find it
convenient to answer. He knew that marriage with his daughter
would bring to Sir Ralph a much greater fortune than she
possessed in her own right.</p>

<p>'Go and ask your disinterested friend if he will take me with
out a dot, and if I were to give my own income to found a
hospital for women.'</p>

<p>'I am sure Sir Ralph would answer in the affirmative,'
replied Lord Flanborough.</p>

<p>'Ask him,' she challenged.</p>

<p>He passed out of the compartment scowling at the offending
Fonso and made his way to Sir Ralph. He had not intended putting
the question, but some chance remark of the baronet's just
before the train reached London gave him an opportunity of
introducing the subject.</p>

<p>'Would you care to marry Moya without the settlement we
agreed, Ralph?'</p>

<p>'What on earth do you mean?' asked Sir Ralph, astonished out
of his sulks. Money was a subject which invariably aroused him
from the deepest lethargy.</p>

<p>'I mean,' said his future father-in-law, 'suppose I say,
&ldquo;You love Moya and all that sort of thing. You are a very
rich man, you can afford to keep her, take her without a
settlement,&rdquo; what would you answer?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not!' said Sir Ralph furiously, 'certainly not! I
don't understand this business at all, Flanborough; I really
don't understand it. We made an arrangement, and now, it seems,
you want to back out of it. What is the objection to the
settlement?'</p>

<p>'I have no objection at all,' admitted Lord Flanborough
uncomfortably, 'but Moya thinks that money is a big factor in
your choice of her.'</p>

<p>'Of course it is,' said Sir Ralph, with brutal directness. 'I
was very fond of Moya, but the settlement was a big
consideration.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Lord Flanborough incoherently. 'Moya's idea, of
course ...'</p>

<p>Michael met them at the station and noticed the constraint of
the party. He understood the reason when a bedraggled Moya and a
young man whose face was criss-crossed with scratches and whose
clothes were in shreds made their appearance. There was no
explanation possible, and Michael wisely asked for none. He
handed over Lord Flanborough and his friend to the care of the
city detective officer in charge of the case, and when they had
gone he turned to Moya.</p>

<p>'Have you two people been fighting?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Father's horribly angry with me,' she said, 'because I am
going to marry Fonso.'</p>

<p>He stared at her in amazement. 'Do you mean to tell me that
you are not going to marry Ralph?'</p>

<p>'I am not,' she said resolutely.</p>

<p>'And this is Fonso?' The girl nodded. Michael threw back his
head and filled the station with laughter.</p>

<p>'You don't know Fonso, do you?' she said. 'He's horribly
poor. Aren't you, dear?'</p>

<p>'Horribly,' admitted the young man, but did not seem
unhappy.</p>

<p>'And you are going to marry him,' said Michael.</p>

<p>'Of course I am going to marry him,' said the girl
wrathfully. 'I didn't expect that you would disapprove.'</p>

<p>'Disapprove?' he chuckled, and catching her up in his strong
arms he kissed her.</p>

<p>'We will all go along and have some grub,' he said. 'Dash
home and make yourself respectable, Moya. I see your father has
left his car for you. Meet me at Sebo's in an hour's time.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT is necessary to tell the story of what was
undoubtedly one of the strangest and most audacious crimes
recorded in the annals of crime with greater detail and at
greater length than is ordinarily necessary.</p>

<p>Le Flavier of the French police, who is surely the greatest
living authority on the subject of modern crime, has likened
Kate Westhanger's masterpiece (he does not refer to her, by the
way) to the first of the Napoleonic campaigns against Italy, and
has published an elaborate treatise showing the points of
resemblance which are not so far-fetched as some of the critics
in their hasty review of his work are justified in saying.
Kirschner, a little-quoted authority, but nevertheless a
brilliant and talented philocriminologist, has said that it
would be humanly impossible to reduplicate such a crime, and
that at any rate it would be wholly impossible to excel the
ingenuity which planned the strategies of the issue.</p>

<p>At 8.30 on the night of May 14th the Charter Queen, eight
thousand tons, commander T. Brown, came to her moorings in E
basin, No. 3 Quay of the Seahampton Docks. She carried a hundred
and twenty third-class, seventy-four second-class and fifty-nine
first-class passengers, a general cargo, and in her strong room
£44,800 of bar gold. They were made up of four hundred and
forty-eight £100 ingots, bearing the stamp of the Central Rand
Gold Extraction Company.</p>

<p>The passengers were landed and dispatched by special train to
London, preceded by another train carrying the mails. The mail
train left at 9.27, the passenger at 9.42. By 10.17 the gold
ingots had been landed, checked and conveyed to a waiting train,
where they were checked again under the superintendence of
Inspector K. Morris of the Dock police. At 10.22 the engine
backed into the train and was coupled up, and the superintendent
of the line being unavoidably absent (he was discovered locked
in an empty house the next morning), the driver received his
'right away' from Assistant-Inspector Thomas Massey, who had
arrived that day from London, and who spoke to the driver and
fireman before the train pulled out.</p>

<p>'You know this road, I suppose?' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' replied the driver, 'I have been down here
several times.'</p>

<p>The inspector was not wholly satisfied. In the first place,
he resented seeing 'foreign drivers' on his road, but the two
men had arrived from London bearing a letter from Sir Ralph to
the superintendent of the road, a letter which afterwards proved
to be a forgery. The letter instructed the superintendent to
give the men charge of the engine, offering, as a reason, their
reliability and the fact that they were two of the best drivers
on the North Central, which railway was also under the control
of Sir Ralph Sapson.</p>

<p>The train pulled out, and from this onward its adventures
began.</p>

<p>From the moment it left Seahampton Town station, the train
was never out of sight for longer than ten minutes. Every signal
box along the line bad received special instructions
particularly to note its passing, and in addition to the
conventional record which is kept of every train, specially to
notify not only to the next box, but to London the hour of its
dispatch. The road may be briefly described.</p>

<p>From Seahampton it ran straight to the market town of
Sevilley, and then over the S-shape road across to Tolbridge. It
may be remarked, in passing, that between Sevilley and Tolbridge
was the level crossing at which Moya had met with her accident.
Between Tolbridge and Pinham the road pushed straight through
uneven ground, passing successively under Tolbridge Hill,
Beckham Beacon and Pinham Heights, under each of which it passed
through tunnels, the tunnels being connected nearly all the way
by deep cuttings.</p>

<p>It was a rainy night, for the drizzle which set in at six in
the evening had continued until there was a veritable deluge.
Sevilley (East) signal box reported the gold train as having
passed at 11.7, and this fact was supported by the times given
by six signalmen between Tolbridge and Sevilley. The train
slowed at Tolbridge and entered Tolbridge tunnel. Between
Beckham tunnel and Tolbridge tunnel is a signal box which
reported the special at 11.32. The signal box was situated close
to the line and rather near the ground and the signalman states
that he not only saw the train pass him in the pelting rain, but
that he saw the tail-lights disappear into Beckham tunnel, which
is built on a curve.</p>

<p>The times are interesting. At 11.32 the train entered Beckham
tunnel. At 11.42 the signalman on the northern side of Pinham
tunnel reported the train as having passed. It was raining, but
owing to the unusual character of this new service and his
natural curiosity to see a £3,000,000 'special,' he had his
window open and saw the three green lights flash past and the
red tail-lights disappearing in the distance. Between Beckham
signal box and Pinham signal box the distance is five miles, but
the theory is that at this point the train slowed to thirty
miles an hour, which accounted for the unusual length of time it
took to traverse this short distance.</p>

<p>At Maidmore, Stanborn, Quexley Paddocks and Catford Bridge,
on the outskirts of London, the train was reported and timed.
The next station to Catford Bridge is Balham Hill, and the
signalman at Balham Hill stated at the subsequent inquiry that
he was given and accepted the gold special at 11.53 and lowered
the 'distant off' and the 'home' signals, at the same time
warning the next northern station, which was Kennington
Junction, that he had accepted the '.46 up,' which was the
official designation of the special.</p>

<p>He waited for ten minutes and saw no sign of the train,
whereupon he called Quexley Paddocks and asked if there had not
been a mistake, since the run was not more than seven minutes.
Quexley Paddocks replied that the train had passed through going
at fifty miles an hour at the moment she had been signalled. No
further news was received, and the Catford Bridge signalman,
becoming alarmed, reported to the stationmaster on duty, who
sent two platelayers along the line. They walked as far as
Quexley Paddocks, but saw no sign of a train. The gold special
had disappeared as though the earth had opened and received
it.</p>

<p>All these times had been verified. Every signalman and
station-master was interrogated, without in any way shaking the
veracity of the witnesses. When the platelayers reached Quexley
Paddocks and reported the disappearance of the train, London was
informed. Between Quexley Paddocks and Catford Bridge the line
runs through market gardens, and what is very unusual so close
to London, it passes over a level crossing, the gates of which
are electrically controlled from Quexley Paddocks signal
box.</p>

<p>And here is the most remarkable of the statements that were
made. The signalman, Henry George Wallis, states that after the
gold special had passed and he had brought his signals back to
danger, he had noticed a strange disturbance on the dial of the
electrical apparatus by which the gates were opened or closed,
and it was discovered the next morning, when he endeavoured to
open the gates to allow an army traction-engine to pass, that
the gates refused to work. That happening, however, was very
thoroughly investigated on the following day.</p>

<p>Michael had dined and supped with Moya and Fonso Blaxton, and
they had had a riotous and wholly joyous evening. He had
returned to his flat at half-past eleven, calling en route at
the Yard, for he was still very uneasy about Kate's threat, and
he was anxious also to find out if there had been any discovery
made in connection with the outrage of the morning. The case was
not in his hands, since the crime had been committed within the
jurisdiction of the city police, and the City Criminal
Investigation Department had control of the investigations.</p>

<p>T.B. was at the office, and had no news to give. Michael went
home and to bed. He was aroused at half-past twelve by
telephone. It was the voice of T.B. Smith.</p>

<p>'They've done it, Mike. Come down at once.'</p>

<p>'What have they done?' asked Michael with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p>'They've pinched the blooming train!' said T.B.
vulgarly.</p>

<p>A special train had been made up for the police, and Michael
was on the platform of Catford Bridge station by half-past one,
and was reading the reports which had been transmitted by the
various signalmen. To add to the mystery, a mineral train from
Seahampton which had followed the gold special at half an hour's
interval, but at a slower pace, had come straight through
without noticing anything unusual. It had crossed the down empty
at Tolbridge, and that was the only other train that was met
until it reached the suburbs of London, where the night traffic
was more general. Sir Ralph was one of the party that went down
to Catford Bridge, and a very distressed and worried man he
was.</p>

<p>'I asked that fellow Flanborough to come,' he wailed, 'and
what do you think the selfish beast said? He said it was my
responsibility. Can you imagine anything more brutal?'</p>

<p>'Is the gold insured?'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>'Not wholly: it was fully insured as far as Seahampton,' he
said grimly. 'After that the responsibility is partly mine, and
partly Flanborough's, and partly the underwriters'. Isn't it too
awful for words?'</p>

<p>T.B. came into the waiting-room at that moment, clad in
oilskins and sou'wester.</p>

<p>'You had better take complete charge of this case, Mike,' he
said. 'Sir Ralph will give you any assistance, I'm sure.'</p>

<p>'Can I have a break-down train?'</p>

<p>'I can bring one down here in twenty minutes,' said Sir
Ralph.</p>

<p>'Is it equipped with searchlights?'</p>

<p>Sir Ralph consulted an official.</p>

<p>'We've naptha flares. Will they do?'</p>

<p>'They will do,' said Michael. 'Put a truck in front of the
engine and arrange the flares so that they light up the
line.'</p>

<p>He spent the night in an open truck, slowly passing down the
line searching for some clue which would afford a solution to
the mystery. Particularly thorough was his search of the three
tunnels, but they yielded nothing, and he reached Seahampton as
the dawn was breaking without having made any discovery which
would help him.</p>

<p>He went back to town by the break-down train, sleeping in the
guard's caboose and reached Quexley in time to receive from the
retiring signalman the story of his eccentric gates. Michael was
interested, and with the man for a guide, he followed the course
of the controlling wire which passed through a length of iron
piping from the signal box to the gate.</p>

<p>'The electrician tells me that the wire has been cut
somewhere,' said the man. 'He has tried his instrument on
it.'</p>

<p>'The wire cannot be cut if it is inside the iron casing,'
said Michael.</p>

<p>'It is either cut or fused,' said the man.</p>

<p>The detective walked very slowly, pausing now and again to
examine the black painted pipe. Presently he stopped. He had
detected something and stopped to examine the pipe more closely.
It was clear that it had been freshly painted. He passed his
hand round it slowly, and suddenly he felt an unexpected
softness.'This isn't iron,' he said.</p>

<p>He took out his pocket-knife and scraped. A little hole had
been burnt into the steel by a portable blow-pipe, and the wires
inside had been fused together by the heat.</p>

<p>'That explains it,' said Michael. 'What effect would this
have on the gates?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Well, you couldn't open them from the box,' said the man.
'Could you open them by hand?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. We've got a chap on duty now who does nothing but
open and shut them,' said the man. 'While the current is on,
they are locked. They work like ordinary gates, except that you
have to be very careful when you lock them.'</p>

<p>Michael waited until a train had passed and then
experimented. The gates opened and closed easily enough.</p>

<p>'What do you mean when you tell me that you have to be
careful with the catch?'</p>

<p>'Well, ordinarily, when you use it without the current,' said
the man, 'the catch falls, and cannot be lifted except by
electric control.'</p>

<p>Michael made an inspection of the 'catch.' It was a steel
block working on a pivot and obviously operated
magnetically.</p>

<p>'It doesn't go up or down, now,' said Michael after testing
it.</p>

<p>'It looks to me,' said the man, 'as though it has been forced
up.'</p>

<p>There was no doubt that what he said was true, for the
detective saw the unmistakable mark of a jemmy on the wooden
casing about the lock. But why on earth did they want to open
the gate? If the train had been found rifled on this stretch of
line the need for an open gate would have been easy to explain.
The train would have been stopped here and, supposing they could
force the locks of the safe, the thieves could have loaded their
gold and got away&mdash;but no train had been found.</p>

<p>Michael passed through the turnstile and examined the road
for something to guide him to a solution. It had been raining
throughout the night, and more than one traction engine had
passed, as was evident from the wheel marks. He explored the
road for a hundred yards and found nothing. Then he tried the
other gate and found that there the catch had also been forced.
The first twenty yards of the road was soft and the wheel tracks
were indistinguishable. At the end of this patch, however, the
going was harder, the crown of the road had drained off the rain
and even the traction engine had left no great impression.</p>

<p>Michael walked a pace or two, then stopped and whistled and
well might he whistle, for there plain to be seen, and not to be
confused with any other track, was the deep and narrow furrow
and the broad impression which could have only been made by
railway wheels. He followed the track for another hundred yards
where it struck the main road and a tram line, and from there
every track disappeared.</p>

<p>Very weary and dishevelled, he presented himself to T.B.
Smith and made his report.</p>

<p>'You don't seriously suggest that they took a railway train
off the line and put it on the road, do you?' asked T.B. in
wonder. 'It's impossible!'</p>

<p>'Of course it's impossible,' said Michael irritably, 'the
whole thing is impossible. You can't steal a railway train
&mdash;but they've done it!'</p>

<p>He found with the assistant commissioner Sir Ralph whose
agitation was pathetic.</p>

<p>'It's pretty rough on me, old man,' said the baronet, with
that friendliness which the superior person invariably adopts in
a moment of his misfortune. 'I have lost a wife and a railway
train in twenty-four hours. What the dickens are you laughing
at?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' said Michael, recovering his gravity. 'It was
almost worth everything to see your face!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="first">BY six o'clock that evening Michael Pretherston
was back again at his work, passing down from station to station
on a pilot engine, questioning and cross-examining the officials
concerned.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith picked him up at Maidmore, going down by the
ordinary train.</p>

<p>'Have you found anything?'</p>

<p>'I have a theory,' said Michael. 'I'd like you to listen to
what the station-master here has to say.'</p>

<p>'Have you questioned him?'</p>

<p>'Not yet,' said Michael, 'but I have an idea he will say
exactly what the man at Stanborn said.'</p>

<p>The inspector, who had been on night duty at the time the
train passed, proved to be a very intelligent and observant man.
He told the same story, that the rain was falling very heavily
and that he had seen the distant lights of the gold special,
which had flown through the dark station at an incredible
pace.</p>

<p>'Is it not a fact,' said Michael, 'that it passed you before
you realized it was gone?'</p>

<p>The man was surprised.</p>

<p>'That is so, sir. It seemed as though I had hardly seen the
head-lights come into the station before I saw the tail-lights
going out.'</p>

<p>'Did it whistle as it passed through?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the man, 'a deafening whistle. I remarked to
my porter at the time that it must be trying a new kind of
&ldquo;shrieker.&rdquo; It made the most fiendish row, and you
could hear nothing else.'</p>

<p>'It whistled through all the stations where there was
somebody on duty,' said Michael, turning to T.B. Smith. 'It is a
curious fact that at Stanborn halt and Merchley, which are
closed for the night, they made no noise at all. Was the station
in darkness?' he said, turning to the inspector.</p>

<p>'Practically so, sir,' said the man. 'There was one light on
the down platform where I was standing, but it was a very dark
night and it was impossible to distinguish anything on the other
platform. All that we saw was the flash of lights, and the train
had passed before one had realized that it had gone.'</p>

<p>The inspector at Pinham Heights station had a similar story
to tell. But the Tolbridge Junction signalman and the Tolbridge
assistant station-master did not report any whistle or any
unusual happening.</p>

<p>T.B. and Michael spent the night at Tolbridge, and resumed
their journey at daybreak. It was a slow and laborious business.
Once between Pinham and Beckham Beacon, Michael had stopped the
train and switched it on to a sidetrack.</p>

<p>'Why is there a sidetrack here?' he asked.</p>

<p>The railway official who accompanied him, and who by this
time was very weary of the whole business, explained vaguely
that it was partly to provide a very necessary relief for any
congestion on this section, and partly to connect up a 'chalk
pit or something' which now, however, was no longer used.</p>

<p>Michael walked along the rusted rails for a quarter of a
mile. They led toward a low line of hills about three miles
away. Rank vegetation grew between the sleepers, for it had been
many years since its private owners had taken the trouble to put
this little branch line in working order. The road ended
abruptly with a big buffer made of sleepers, and behind this the
rail drooped limply over a great hole as though there had been a
subsidence of the earth.</p>

<p>Michael turned back and joined T.B.</p>

<p>'It could not have passed over here. The rail is rusty and
runs into a large-sized hole at the other end,' said Michael in
despair. 'Well, go on, driver.'</p>

<p>It was a day of inquiries which led nowhere, and Michael
returned that night to town, weary and sick at heart.
Nevertheless, he had the dim beginnings of a theory which,
however, he refused to communicate to his chief.</p>

<p>'It is rather fantastic,' he excused himself; 'but then, the
whole thing is fantastic. It is obviously impossible to steal a
railway train and carry it through the streets of London without
somebody being attracted by the novelty of the spectacle.'</p>

<p>'Will you see Sir Ralph?' asked T.B. 'He has been waiting
here for an hour to meet you.'</p>

<p>'Hasn't he got a home?' asked Michael irritably. He saw the
distracted baronet, but could offer him little hope.</p>

<p>'It is impossible they can get away with it,' said Sir Ralph.
'My expert tells me that it will take them two days to break
through the steel walls whatever they use.'</p>

<p>A thought struck Michael. 'Have you a large scale map of your
southern railway system?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I will have it sent round to you tonight,' said the baronet.
'What chance do you think there is?' he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'I think a very poor chance,' said Michael frankly. 'You see
Kate doesn't take any risk.'</p>

<p>'Kate?' said the baronet.</p>

<p>'You call her the &ldquo;Princess Bacheffski.&rdquo;
Flanborough calls her &ldquo;Miss Tenby.&rdquo; As &ldquo;Miss
Tenby&rdquo; she secured Flanborough's code, and through some of
her agents in the telegraph office learned about the shipment.
As &ldquo;Princess Bacheffski&rdquo; she wheedled from you the
whole of your wonderful scheme for bringing gold from
Seahampton, and probably discovered the nature of the steel you
use.'</p>

<p>'Good heavens!' Sir Ralph sank into a chair and turned pale.
'You don't mean to tell me&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'That is what I mean to tell you. Didn't you realize that the
whole thing was a put-up job? Why should the car of the Princess
break down at your front door?'</p>

<p>'But she was so beautifully dressed.'</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't she be beautifully dressed?' asked Michael
mercilessly. 'She probably carried twenty thousand pounds worth
of diamonds. Wasn't it worth it? Didn't you give her information
which she could not have bought for the money?'</p>

<p>'Then you mean to say that she is a common swindler?'</p>

<p>'She is a very uncommon swindler,' said Michael. 'There's
only one thing that puzzles me,' he said, half to himself; 'what
did she want of Reggie?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Boltover was interrupted in the delicate
business of dressing for dinner by a peremptory demand that an
officer of Scotland Yard should be admitted. He was relieved to
discover that it was nothing more formidable than Michael.</p>

<p>'I have come to ask you about your friend Vera.'</p>

<p>Mr. Boltover winced.</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' he said, 'don't mention that lady's name.
It is a sore subject. Don't mention her, dear old fellow,
don't.'</p>

<p>'Don't be an ass,' said Michael good-humouredly. 'You must
give me an idea of the questions which she asked you. What did
she talk about?'</p>

<p>But Mr. Boltover's mind was a blank. It was his boast that he
did not know there was such a thing as yesterday.</p>

<p>'Did she ask you to give her any information about things you
are interested in?'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' said Reggie Boltover, shaking his head, 'if
she did I have forgotten it. All I know is that she very
seriously compromised me. I have not been to Sebo's since.'</p>

<p>'As you are such a perfectly hopeless person,' said Michael,
'will you give me a note to your secretary or your factotum or
whatever human substitute for mentality you possess, instructing
him to give me a full list of your properties?'</p>

<p>'With the greatest pleasure in life, with every happiness,'
said Reggie earnestly, 'with the greatest alacrity!'</p>

<p>Armed with this, Michael called the next morning at the
office of one who was frequently referred to by journalists as a
'merchant prince,' and when he came out into Threadneedle Street
his step was lighter and his eye was brighter than it had been
for weeks.</p>

<p>'Now, Kate,' he said between his teeth, 'this is where you
finish.'</p>

<p>He could have had all the men he wanted, but he preferred
making his investigation without assistance. He went home and
changed into a knickerbocker suit, took his oldest overcoat, a
walking stick and a Browning pistol with two spare magazines. He
did not ask for a special engine, but travelled to Pinham
Heights station by ordinary train. He showed his authority to
the station-master, who, however, recognized him.</p>

<p>'I don't want anybody to know that I am down here,' he said,
'and I must rely upon your discretion to see that my wishes in
this respect are carried out. Am I likely to meet any
platelayers or people on the line between here and
Tolbridge?'</p>

<p>'You will meet nobody until you come to Tolbridge box; but be
very careful,' warned the station-master, 'the down express goes
through the tunnel in ten minutes. I should advise you not to
leave until that has passed.'</p>

<p>This advice Michael thought it expedient to accept, and not
until the rocking train had shrieked through the station, and
the receding red lamps were disappearing in the darkness of the
tunnel, did he walk down the sloping platform into the six-foot
way and pass into the smoking tunnel. He could have reached his
destination by the high road which runs from Pinham round the
foot of the Beacon, but for reasons of his own, he preferred to
accept the discomforts of the darker way and the uneven going.
He passed through the tunnel after a seemingly interminable walk
and came to the switch line where his engine had been
side-tracked. He followed this until he came to the buffer and
the deep hole beyond.</p>

<p>He examined the buffer very carefully, retraced his
footsteps, and examined the rail. It was as he had seen before,
red with rust. Nevertheless, he went on his knees and examined
the rail through a magnifying glass. Then he wetted his finger,
and drew it along the red surface. He looked at his finger. It
was red. But it was not the red of rust.</p>

<p>He walked back, carefully examining every inch of the rail
until he found what he sought. At one place by the side of the
actual rail was a little red spot. It was no larger than a
three-penny-piece and it was to all appearance rust. But rust
does not develop on a wooden sleeper, and he found the
counterpart of this spot, a trifle larger, on the wood. Again he
wetted his finger and was satisfied. For this was not rust, but
a very common form of distemper employed by builders.</p>

<p>He went back to the buffer and the sagging rail, and climbed
down the hole which was about six feet deep. He had noticed that
a quantity of green stagnant water at the bottom of the hole
advertised its age. Again he drew his hand along the water and
examined his palm. It was green, but his strongest magnifying
glass (and he had one of peculiarly high power) failed to reveal
any sign of that fluorescence which forms on the surface of
water, and gives it its peculiar vivid green. Instead, he saw a
number of irregular specks, which were undoubtedly crystals.</p>

<p>'Which means,' said Michael to himself, 'that Kate is an
artist even if Fonso isn't.'</p>

<p>The green scum which had deceived him at first had been
artificially created. Some chemical had been dissolved and had
re-crystallized on the surface. He dug into the soft earth on
the other side without securing any data as to when the hole had
been made, but nearer the surface and on the rim, he saw the
white tendrils of growing coltsfoot which was still humid. One
tentacle had been shaved away, but the plant had not yet begun
to die, nor the exposed root to blacken.</p>

<p>'This hole was dug on the night of the robbery,' said
Michael, 'and the earth was artistically removed. Kate would
depend upon the railway officials not having bothered to inspect
this bit of line.'</p>

<p>As matter of fact, this was so. It was on private property,
and after it left the edge of the railway land, it ceased to be
their responsibility. The buffer was also newly erected. He
found this when he had dug down to its foundation. The wood was
still dry, and there were blades of grass and tiny fragments of
plant in the earth beneath. He walked round the little pit and
reached the rails on the opposite side. They were rusted as
artistically as their fellows. The line twisted and curved
across level country for a mile before it turned the shoulder of
a hill and disappeared into a gorge, evidently excavated in the
course of the working. Behind this was another chalk hole, and
he gathered from an examination on the map, that along this
further ridge ran a road.</p>

<p>The abandoned cement works had been so built that they were
not in view from the railway itself. Possibly the philanthropic
purchaser had pulled down the one remaining smoke stack on his
occupation and the whitened buildings did not stand out against
the chalky soil behind them.</p>

<p>He had all the evidence he wanted before he had traversed
one-half of the two miles which separated him from the chalk
pits. The mark of the heavy wheels was visible now. In places
the weeds which grew thickly between the sleepers had been
crushed by their passage. He now left the rail and began moving
round in a wide semicircle that would bring him to a low neck in
the hill. His plan was to climb the hill from here, and work his
way back along its crest until he overlooked the works.</p>

<p>He was now in the danger zone. He shifted his stick to his
left hand and slipped out his pistol and pulled back the
cover.</p>

<p>It took him an hour to gain the crest of the neck. He found
it more difficult to climb than he had thought. Evidently chalk
had been quarried here, and save in one or two places, he was
faced by a sheer unscaleable wall. It was hard climbing all the
way, and he was hot and thirsty by time he reached the top.</p>

<p>From the neck he could only secure a partial view of the
works. He had taken the precaution to bring a pair of prismatic
glasses, and with these he surveyed the ground. There was no
sign of the train and for a moment his heart sank. Then he
picked up the trail, and followed it yard by yard, and he could
scarcely restrain himself from a yell of joy when he saw the
rail led to a big shed, the gates of which were closed.</p>

<p>Originally, this may have been the mill house, but the new
tenants had re-laid the line so that it passed into the
building. He replaced his glasses and continued his climb. He
was halfway between the neck and the point which would directly
overlook the works when he heard the hum of a motor-car, and
dropped flat.</p>

<p>He was within fifty yards of the road which was slightly
above him, and looking up very cautiously he saw a car dash
past, and disappear over the rise. There was no mistaking its
occupant. It was the Spaniard, Gregori. He rose cautiously and
continued his progress, keeping a sharp look-out for the
sentries which he knew would be posted on the road. The path he
followed was a beaten track. He realized this before he had gone
much farther, and sought to find a way either to the left or the
right, but without success.</p>

<p>He halted and debated with himself the question as to whether
he should go back. It was madness to attempt to make the capture
alone. Even now, he may have been detected, but if this was the
case, by the time he went back and procured assistance, the
whole gang would have gone, and probably the gold with them. Of
the two risks he decided to take the first.</p>

<p>Little time was given to him to regret this decision. He had
taken three paces when he heard the unmistakable whirr of a
lariat. He turned to face the danger, pistol in hand, but too
late. The rope settled about his neck, he felt a sharp
nerve-racking jar and fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH walked into his outer office.</p>

<p>'Any news of Mr. Pretherston?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Any news of Barr?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>T.B. clicked his lips impatiently.</p>

<p>'Who's looking after them?'</p>

<p>'Detective-sergeant Grey, sir,' was the reply. 'You know we
traced him as far as Pinham Heights. After that he seems to have
been lost sight of.'</p>

<p>'Have you notified the chief constables of Hampshire, Sussex
and Surrey?' asked T.B.</p>

<p>'That has been done, sir,' said the officer. 'The local
constabulary are making a search.'</p>

<p>T.B. bit his lips.</p>

<p>'I can understand Mr. Pretherston going,' he said, 'but what
has happened to Barr?'</p>

<p>His subordinate very wisely offered no solution.</p>

<p>There were other anxious inquirers. Moya Felton had called
that morning. Sir Ralph had made two visits to headquarters,
though it was doubtful whether his anxiety was in any way
associated with the well-being of Michael Pretherston.</p>

<p>'I think Michael will find the gang,' said T.B., 'though he
may be too late to get the gold.'</p>

<p>'What do I want the gang for?' demanded Sir Ralph wrathfully.
'Will the Government give me £2,800,000 for them? The gang can
go to the devil, so far as I am concerned. I want the gold.'</p>

<p>'You may get neither,' said T.B. 'At any rate it ought to be
very pleasing to you, Sir Ralph, that Michael Pretherston is
risking his life to recover your property.'</p>

<p>'Isn't he paid to do it?' demanded Sir Ralph; 'isn't that the
job of a policeman? By Gad! commissioner, one would imagine that
Pretherston was doing something out of the common! I take risks
every day of my life.'</p>

<p>'If you could see my mind,' said T.B. Smith suavely, 'you
would realize that you are taking the biggest risk you have
taken today. I advise you to go home and get into a calmer frame
of mind.'</p>

<p>'When shall I hear anything?' asked the truculent baronet.
'Whenever you are within earshot,' snapped the commissioner.</p>

<p>'Show Sir Ralph out, constable.'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough did not obtrude his inquiries. He was so far
reconciled to Moya that he could discuss the matter
dispassionately, without reference to the mesalliance which
threatened his family.</p>

<p>'I think on the whole, Moya,' he said, 'I had better not see
Ralph. After all, business is business and friends are friends;
but I disclaim all responsibility for that gold after it left
the ship. It is Ralph's business entirely, and I simply won't
accept his suggestion that I share his responsibility to the
slightest degree.'</p>

<p>'Will he have to bear the loss?'</p>

<p>'Well, partially bear the loss. A portion will be borne by
the underwriters. Ralph, I am afraid, is a very mean man. I hate
saying anything about my friends, but Ralph is really economical
to a point of meanness. I advised him to insure the gold, and to
save a beggarly premium he only insured half of it. I am very
sorry for him'&mdash;he shook his head mournfully as evidence of
his sympathy&mdash;'I am very, very sorry for him, but I think
it is wiser that we do not meet until this business matter is
completely settled. On the whole,' he added thoughtfully,
'perhaps it is better that your engagement with Ralph is broken
off. He has said some very unkind things about you, Moya, which
aroused my anger. I do not think you have been sensible, but I
cannot allow any person to discuss you uncharitably.'</p>

<p>If the truth be told, Sir Ralph had said very little about
the girl, and very much about his lordship, whom he had accused
of deliberately evading his responsibilities.</p>

<p>This was at the one interview which they had had. It pleased
Lord Flanborough to pose as a devoted father, but he did not
deceive anybody but himself, for Moya had had a first-hand
account of the interview from Ralph, who had asked her to use
her influence to bring about a change in Lord Flanborough's
attitude. It was the day after the disappearance of Michael
Pretherston, and Sir Ralph's nerves were a little shaky.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate in the circumstances that he had decided
that afternoon to make a call upon the man who, a week before,
he had fondly believed was to be his father-in-law. Lord
Flanborough had not taken the precaution of warning his servants
that he was not at home to Sir Ralph, so he had nobody to blame
but himself when the door of his study was flung violently open
that afternoon and Sir Ralph Sapson stalked in.</p>

<p>'My dear Sapson,' stammered his lordship, flabbergasted by
the unexpectedness of the visit. 'Pray, do sit down.'</p>

<p>'I am not going to sit down. I tell you I am not going to sit
down,' roared, rather than said, Ralph.</p>

<p>'Let me close the door,' said his lordship in alarm. 'My dear
man, please remember&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I remember nothing except that I am on the brink of ruin.
That is what it means. I am on the brink of ruin,' said Ralph,
violently thumping the desk. 'It is going to cost me a million
and a half, and you must bear your share, Flanborough! You are
responsible. If it had not been for your infernal daughter, this
would not have occurred.'</p>

<p>'My daughter,' said Lord Flanborough, and feeling himself on
perfectly safe ground he could speak with hauteur, 'is not a
matter for discussion, and if you cannot speak respectfully of
her, I beg you to leave this room.'</p>

<p>'If it had not been for your daughter, we should have
remembered to send Griggs back.'</p>

<p>'I am not in charge of the railway,' said his lordship with
mock humility. 'I cannot order engine-drivers to return to
Seahampton. Be reasonable, Sapson!'</p>

<p>'You have got to bear your share,' said the other doggedly.
'You are morally responsible. I wish I had never thought of
bringing your infernal ships to Seahampton.' He was haggard and
drawn of face. In two days he seemed to have shrunk so that his
usually well-fitting clothes hung on him loosely.</p>

<p>'Everything can be discussed in a quiet business-like way,'
said Lord Flanborough. 'I am very sorry that you have this loss.
It is by no means certain that it is a loss, but business is
business&mdash;you cannot expect me to shoulder your
responsibilities, my dear friend.'</p>

<p>'It is your responsibility as well as mine,' stormed Ralph,
jumping up from his chair and advancing upon the little man who
stepped cautiously backward, 'and I insist upon your accepting
your share.'</p>

<p>'Which would amount to?' suggested his lordship.</p>

<p>'About £700,000,' growled the other.</p>

<p>'£700,000! Impossible!' said Lord Flanborough
emphatically.</p>

<p>Ralph turned livid. 'If you don't,' he hissed, thumping his
palm with his fist, 'if you don't&mdash;'</p>

<p>At that moment help came in the shape of Moya. She nodded
coolly to Sir Ralph, and crossed the room to her father.</p>

<p>'There is no news of Michael,' she said.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' sighed his lordship.</p>

<p>'Michael!' sneered Ralph. 'There is no news of the money!
That's the important thing, Moya!'</p>

<p>'We are not on &ldquo;Moya&rdquo; terms any more, Sir Ralph,'
she said quietly.</p>

<p>'Rub it in,' groaned the man.</p>

<p>'I don't want to rub it in. We all have our troubles, but
some of us bear them less courageously than others. It won't
ruin you if you do lose all this money. You know you are
enormously rich.'</p>

<p>'I am not going to lose it,' said Sir Ralph doggedly. 'Your
father has to bear his share.'</p>

<p>'If father is responsible, he will bear his share,' said the
girl; 'But it is not by any means certain that he is
responsible, is it, Papa?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' said Lord Flanborough, placing a table
between himself and his infuriated partner.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and Sibble came in, somewhat
furtively. He looked mysteriously at Moya and she went to
him.</p>

<p>'What is it, Sibble?' she asked.</p>

<p>'There's a man to see you, miss,' he said. 'I think it is
something very special.'</p>

<p>'To see me? Who is he?'</p>

<p>'I don't know who he is, miss, but he has a very special
message for you.'</p>

<p>She went out into the hall. A respectable-looking man stood
hat in hand. By his thick coat she thought at first he was an
omnibus driver. In a sense, she was right.</p>

<p>'Are you Lady Moya Felton, madam?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the girl.</p>

<p>He handed her a card. She took it. It was a business card
announcing that Messrs. Acton &amp; Arkwright, contractors, were
prepared to remove anything from machinery to furniture, and
that they had a 'larger number of motor lorries than any other
firm doing business in the south of England.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid there is a mistake,' she said. 'I didn't send
for you.'</p>

<p>'No, miss, we've brought the goods.'</p>

<p>'The goods?' she said, puzzled.</p>

<p>He led the way to the door. Lining one side of the street and
stretching from the house to the corner of Gaspard Place were
ten motor lorries.</p>

<p>'Here's the name.' He turned the card over.</p>

<p>'Lord Flanborough, Felton House, Grosvenor Avenue,' said the
man, reading it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Have you any letter?'</p>

<p>'No, miss, these are all the instructions I had. I was told
to bring the chemicals to his lordship, and ask for you.'</p>

<p>'Chemicals?' she said.</p>

<p>Her father had followed her to the door.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he asked.</p>

<p>'This man has brought some chemicals for you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, nonsense, there is some mistake,' said Lord FIanborough.
'I am not a chemist.'</p>

<p>He went down the steps with the girl to the first lorry. She
looked inside and apparently it was empty.</p>

<p>'What is it you have brought?' she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'There they are, miss, on the floor.' And then she saw a
number of packages wrapped in sacking.</p>

<p>'They're pretty heavy,' said the man, 'considering their
size.'</p>

<p>She reached out her hand and tried to draw one toward her. It
defied her efforts. Lord Flanborough tried and succeeded in
moving it. Something in its shape startled him.</p>

<p>'Have you a knife?' he asked the man. The contractor produced
a big clasp-knife and opened it.</p>

<p>'Be careful, my lord,' he warned, 'they're dangerous'&mdash;
But Lord Flanborough had ripped the canvas package and exposed a
dull yellow ingot.</p>

<p>He dropped the knife and stepped back. 'How many wagons are
there?' he asked huskily.</p>

<p>'Ten, sir. They've all got the same number of packages
&mdash;we was to take them to the Docks.'</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough made a rapid calculation.</p>

<p>'Take them into the basement and put them into the coal
cellar,' he said, and went up the steps two at a time and back
into his study.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was still waiting. The rudeness of his host neither
increased nor decreased his irritation.</p>

<p>Lord Flanborough stepped up to him briskly.</p>

<p>'Look here, Sapson,' he said. 'What responsibility do you
want me to bear in the matter of this gold?'</p>

<p>'I want you to bear half.'</p>

<p>'I will do more than that,' said his lordship, 'I will assume
the whole responsibility for £200,000.'</p>

<p>Ralph swung round.</p>

<p>'You will?' he said incredulously.</p>

<p>'I will.'</p>

<p>'Done,' said Sir Ralph and pulled out his cheque book. He
wrote quickly and nervously but quite legibly enough, and handed
the slip to Lord Flanborough, what time his lordship was writing
with more leisure but no less excitement on the other side of
the table.</p>

<p>'There's your cheque,' said Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>'And there's my note freeing you from responsibility,' said
his lordship.</p>

<p>'I am sorry I have been so unpleasant,' said the baronet,
wiping his steaming brow, 'but you will understand.'</p>

<p>'I quite understand,' said Lord Flanborough.</p>

<p>'Business is business,' said Ralph.</p>

<p>'Business is business,' repeated his lordship, and folding
cheque he slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE main building of what had once been
Boltover's Cement Works consisted of four high walls and a slate
roof. Here had stood the wash mills and the revolving knives
which had reduced the clay and mud from the near-by river into
slurry. Leading therefrom was the heating chamber and the kiln
house. There was no trace of mill, though the kilns still
stood.</p>

<p>All the machinery had been removed, the concrete floor
strengthened, and the only engine visible was a great Atlantic
locomotive which had stood with steam up day and night before
the wreckage of two trucks. In each of these was a rough
circular hole, and the blistered paint and the drops of metal
which hung upon the edge or had trickled down its blackened side
told of the terrific heat which had been employed to break
through the steel walls.</p>

<p>Near one wall were a number of small packages neatly stitched
in canvas and ready for removal, and on these sat Mr. Mulberry,
the benignity of whose countenance was somewhat discounted by
the fact that a loaded rifle lay across his knees. Leading from
the main building was a small office approached through a steel
door, and in this was seated the seven guiding spirits of the
great raid. Francis Stockmar, Gregori, Colonel Westhanger,
Colling Jacques, Thomas Stockmar, Mr. Cunningham and Kate.</p>

<p>Gregori was talking. He leant across the table, his hands
lightly clasped, his head on one side turned to the girl who sat
opposite to him and a little to his right.</p>

<p>'I think, Kate, we finish here,' he was saying. 'Crime Street
is getting a little too warm.'</p>

<p>'I didn't expect you to lose your nerve,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm not losing my nerve,' he said with a scowl. 'I am afraid
of losing my life, if you want to know the truth. We are watched
all the time. They know you are out of town and are searching
for you.'</p>

<p>'They found me,' said the girl coolly. 'I am staying at
Brighton.'</p>

<p>'We have made a big haul and it will take us a year to get
rid of it,' Gregori went on; 'but when we have got rid of it, we
shall have enough to settle down.'</p>

<p>'But why do you want to settle down?' she asked.</p>

<p>'My dear Kate,' said her uncle querulously, 'don't ask absurd
questions. You know there is no reason in the world why we
should not settle down. We have enough money.'</p>

<p>'Exactly what do you mean by settling down?' she insisted. 'I
am not being sarcastic. I merely want information. You have
taught me that it is the game and not the prize that is worth
while. That has been my life's teaching. Why, you told me if you
were a millionaire'&mdash;she looked at her uncle under her
bent brows&mdash;'nothing would induce you to be &ldquo;dull
and honest.&rdquo; These were your words.'</p>

<p>'My dear child,' said Colonel Westhanger, 'I have told you
lots of things which have to be interpreted in a liberal spirit.
We have had all the fun we want, and now we will&mdash;' He was
at a loss in his desire to avoid a tautological repetition of a
certain phrase.</p>

<p>'Settle down,' she suggested; 'be dull and honest?'</p>

<p>'But, surely, Kate,' said Gregori impatiently, 'you don't
want to be a hunted beast all your life?'</p>

<p>'Why not?' she asked in astonishment. 'It is just as much fun
being hunted as hunting. You have said that a score of times.
Does Michael Pretherston&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, hang Michael Pretherston!' said Gregori.</p>

<p>'Does Michael Pretherston,' she went on, 'get as much fun out
of chasing me, as I get out of escaping from him? Does Michael
Pretherston find the same exhilaration of mind in following on
my tracks as I find in keeping ahead of him?'</p>

<p>'Anyway,' said Gregori, 'I have had enough of it, and I want
to go out of the business, and I advise you to do the same. And
there is another thing, Kate&mdash;' He looked at the Colonel
for support, but Colonel Westhanger found it convenient at that
moment to be staring at the skylight.</p>

<p>'What is the other thing?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Well, you know I am fond of you,' he said, 'and I want
to&mdash;' He floundered.</p>

<p>'Settle down,' she suggested innocently; 'what is all this
&ldquo;settling down&rdquo; that everybody loves so much? Does
it mean we shall never plan another great coup?' She leant her
elbows on the table. 'Honestly, I am not being wilfully dense. I
know money is useful, because it helps one to prepare the way
for making more money; but I have not been in this'&mdash;she
waved her hand&mdash;'in all these things for money. I told
Michael Pretherston so and he believed me.'</p>

<p>'What have you been telling Michael Pretherston?' asked
Gregori suspiciously.</p>

<p>'I told him that,' she said simply.</p>

<p>'But, my dear girl,' said her uncle, 'fun and excitement and
all that sort of thing are well enough in their way; but you
don't mean to tell me, at this hour, that you have not been
working for the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;?'</p>

<p>'I will tell you as much at this or any other hour,' she
answered immediately.</p>

<p>'I see,' said Gregori with a faint smile; 'then really you
are what I would call a criminal artist&mdash;art for art's
sake, eh?'</p>

<p>'I mean that,' she said again. 'One must judge one's
successes by the amount of money one has made.'</p>

<p>'That is how I joodge it,' said the thick voice of Francis
Stockmar, 'so much mooney, so much sugsess, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'I tell you frankly,' said Gregori, 'I am in this for the
money and so is your uncle. We have taken many risks, some of us
have been caught and some of us,' he said significantly, 'have
been lucky. I've got thirty years in front of me, with any luck,
and so I am going to&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Settle down,' suggested Kate ironically.</p>

<p>'I am going to quit.'</p>

<p>'Come, come, be sensible, Kate,' said the Colonel, patting
her on the shoulder. 'You have been a very good girl, and we owe
you almost everything we have. I am sure everyone agrees that
you have been the brains of our&mdash;er&mdash;association.
The only time when any of us have been caught is when we have
gone out on a side line of our own. Now leave well alone.'</p>

<p>'When hunters have caught the fox,' she said, 'do they leave
well alone, and never hunt again? In war, when a soldier comes
through a battle safely does he leave well alone, and never go
into action again? Does the huntsman, who is nearly caught by a
lion, leave well and lions alone?'</p>

<p>'This is different,' said her uncle doggedly.</p>

<p>'But I don't understand it. If what you say is right, then I
am wrong, and have been wrong all my life. I am wrong, and the
police are right.'</p>

<p>'Of course they're right,' said Gregori. 'What rubbish you
are talking!'</p>

<p>'The police are right?' she asked in open-eyed
astonishment.</p>

<p>'Of course they are right. They must protect society. In five
years' time, when I am settled on my little estate in Spain, and
my house is burgled, do you imagine I shall not call in the
police?'</p>

<p>'I know they are right in their way,' she said, as if she
were speaking her thoughts aloud, 'but we are right, too.'</p>

<p>'We cannot both be right,' said Colonel Westhanger.</p>

<p>'I asked you some time ago,' she said, turning to him, 'which
was the better life&mdash;the dull life or ours. They cannot
both be better. The elementary conditions cannot change. That
life must be the best, or ours.'</p>

<p>'That life is best,' said the Colonel decisively.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>'Then why have you let me live this?' she asked. 'You cannot
change me. I cannot change. I cannot!' she said with vehemence,
and the men noted with amazement the emotion she displayed.
'Nothing can change me!'</p>

<p>Gregori reached out and took her hand, but she snatched it
away.</p>

<p>'I will tell you what can change you, little girl,' he said,
undeterred by the rebuff. 'Love can change you. Give me a
chance.'</p>

<p>She looked at him, and laughed in his face. 'Will you be good
or bad, honest or dishonest? You will only be a half a man
living two lives. Marry you! And am I to go into witness-boxes
to testify against your burglar? And prosecute your poachers? I
am living now, what I believe to be the truth, I believe I have
the right to match my wits against the world and take, by my
intelligence, what the old robber barons took by brutal
strength. If I pass to the other side I should be a liar, living
a life in which I did not believe. I am going on.'</p>

<p>'Then you will go on by yourself.'</p>

<p>'Will I?' she asked softly.</p>

<p>'Go out and find somebody who thinks as you think if you
can,' sneered Gregori. 'You will be obliged to live a lie,
anyway. You will never meet a man who believes in stealing, who
believes in fraud and who will go on so believing, until he is
an old man. You will never meet a man on the other side of life
who would trust you if he knew you, and he would know you unless
you&mdash;went on lying.'</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>'You are in a cleft stick, my little friend, and if you take
my tip you will stick to the friends who know you.' He laughed
again.</p>

<p>'Suppose I come down into Spain and burgle your house?'
&mdash;her eyes lit up&mdash;'and I would do it. Or, suppose,
when you have&mdash;settled down, and when you have all
deposited your symbols of success in your banks, I planned a
little coup and smashed your banks? I could do it easily, and I
would do it,' she said.'What would you do?'</p>

<p>Their faces were a study. The Colonel was stroking his white
moustache. Francis Stockmar was scowling horribly. Mr.
Cunningham was staring blankly at the opposite wall.</p>

<p>'Naturally you would not play such a low-down trick upon your
old friends,' said the Colonel soothingly. 'Nobody believes you
would, Kate, I mean, it would be tragic for some of us, after
spending years of our lives accumulating a little nest-egg, to
find we had become beggars in a night. Of course, speaking
personally, I should consider myself exonerated from any
responsibility I had in regard to our relationship, and I should
have to tell the police&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You would call the police, too, would you? Would you,
Stockmar?'</p>

<p>'Yas,' said the solid Austrian, 'of goorse. The mooney to
recover, ain't it?'</p>

<p>'And you?'</p>

<p>'I don't think you would do anything so treacherous,' said
Mr. Cunningham. 'Naturally, we would not take that sort of thing
lying down.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Colling Jacques. 'The whole matter is this:
when we go back to the respectable world and obey the laws we,
as citizens, are entitled to the protection which the laws give
us.'</p>

<p>'I see. You are, so to speak, Touching Wood. The Wood is the
Law.'</p>

<p>'That is it,' he said. Kate got up and walked to the one
window of the room and looked out upon the dreary yard with its
tangle of twisted machinery, its rusted boilers, its chaos of
rotting cement bags.</p>

<p>'Well, you can all do as you like'&mdash;she turned on them
&mdash;'but I tell you this, that if you think you are going to
&mdash;settle down&mdash;at my expense, and if you think I
have been planning and scheming, and play-acting and lying, only
in order that you might all become respected parish councillors,
you have made a mistake. You talk about my friends. If you are
my friends, Heaven help me! There is one man in the world who is
worth the whole crowd of you.'</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a crash as though a heavy body had
been thrown against a door. Somebody fumbled with the lock and
Gregori jumped up and threw it open. They half carried, half
pushed a gagged and bound man through the doorway. Behind him
peered the saturnine malignant face of his captor, Dr.
Garon.</p>

<p>'Got him,' he said triumphantly.</p>

<p>'Who is it?' asked Gregori, staring at the half conscious
man.</p>

<p>The girl did not ask. She went suddenly cold, for she knew it
was Michael Pretherston.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT is a fact worth remarking upon, that in all
her career, though she had been associated with the most
desperate of criminals, and though she had been surrounded on
all sides by men who would stop at nothing to gain their ends,
Kate had never witnessed an act of violence. Such arrests of
members of the confederation as she had seen had been very
humdrum affairs. The arrival of two strangers, a consultation
carried on in a low tone by a pleasant detective officer, an
urgent call to somebody to 'get my hat' and the disappearance,
very often for a long time, of the member affected. She had
never seen a fellow-creature man-handled, nor did she believe
that there was in her confederates the tigerish malignity which
was now displayed. She looked from face to face in amazement and
horror when they crowded round the handcuffed figure, and flung
him into a chair.</p>

<p>Michael had been choked to insensibility at the first attack.
With the loosening of the rope, he had recovered consciousness
and put up a fight, and had been hammered back to insensibility
by the three men who had watched him from the moment he had
crossed the open ground to the east of the railway, and had lain
in wait for him. They had manacled him with his own handcuffs.
This he realized, as he came back to consciousness, with his
head throbbing and every bone in his body aching.</p>

<p>He leaned his elbows on the table and buried his face in his
hands, striving to collect his thoughts. It was the cold steel
of the handcuff against his nose which was the starting point
from whence he unravelled the situation. The blow which had
felled him had fortunately been broken by his soft, felt hat and
he raised his hand and gingerly felt the bump which Dr. Garon's
loaded cane had raised.</p>

<p>'Now then, wake up,' said Gregori's voice roughly. 'Let's
have a look at you.'</p>

<p>Michael raised his head, and looked at the speaker.</p>

<p>'Hello, Gregori,' he said dully. He looked round the room,
and caught the girl's eyes and for a moment held them.</p>

<p>'You seem to have tumbled into it, my young friend,' said
Colonel Westhanger.</p>

<p>Michael slowly shifted his eyes to the speaker and
smiled.</p>

<p>'We all seem to have tumbled into it, you worse than anybody.
This means a life sentence for you, Colonel.'</p>

<p>The old man's face went white.</p>

<p>'It is only bluff,' said Garon. 'He is here by himself. I
have been watching him for an hour. You tried to pull off the
job on your lonely!'</p>

<p>'Alone,' said the Colonel, and the girl, watching him, saw
his face go hard. 'Alone! Are you sure?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely sure,' said the doctor. He sat straddle-legged on
a chair, leaning on the back and puffing the cigar he had just
lighted.</p>

<p>'It would be rather a serious business if you had made a
mistake, wouldn't it?' drawled Michael. He was recovering his
scattered senses and something of his good spirits.</p>

<p>'You fellows had better make the best of a bad job.'</p>

<p>'What is your idea of the best of a bad job?' sneered
Gregori, 'to take the handcuffs off you and put them on me and
the Colonel? If it means a &ldquo;lifer&rdquo; for the Colonel,
what does it mean for me? You don't suppose I am going back to
Dartmoor to build walls for the moor farmers, do you?'</p>

<p>'What is the alternative?' asked Michael.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what is the alternative,' hissed the other,
thrusting his face into the detective's; 'it is the only
alternative that will give me any satisfaction&mdash;and it is
to put you out.'</p>

<p>'Dot is id,' nodded Stockmar.</p>

<p>The girl's heart almost stopped beating, and for a moment she
closed her eyes and gripped tight to the edge of the table. She
felt physically sick and her knees were trembling under her.
Fortunately their attention was fully occupied with Michael, and
nobody noticed that she had suddenly grown peaked and grey. She
bit her lips, and by sheer effort of will regained control of
herself. She looked at Michael: that little smile of his still
played about the corners of his mouth, and the eyes that were
lifted to Colling Jacques were full of good humour.</p>

<p>'It is you or us, Pretherston,' the engineer was saying. 'You
don't suppose we have been working for this stuff and taken all
the risk, only to see ourselves standing in the dock of the Old
Bailey?'</p>

<p>'Winchester,' corrected the detective. 'It is a very pretty
assize court; the vaulted ceiling will appeal to you, Jacques.
It is in the Gothic style.'</p>

<p>'One moment,' said the Colonel suddenly. With a nod he called
the men to a corner of the room, and for five minutes there was
a whispered consultation. The girl and Michael were left alone,
and obeying some impulse which she could not define, she
suddenly turned her back upon him and walked to the window, a
proceeding which Gregori noticed out of the corner of his eye.
Presently the little conference broke up, and the Colonel came
back with the others.</p>

<p>'Look here, Pretherston, I am going to make a proposition to
you. You are not a rich man, I take it.'</p>

<p>'My private affairs don't concern you,' said Michael calmly,
'and I certainly am not prepared to discuss them with you.'</p>

<p>'This job is worth two and a half millions, and there are ten
of us in it. Help us to make a get-away, and there is not far
short of a quarter of a million for you.'</p>

<p>The girl swung round and looked at Michael. How would he take
this offer? She knew how great was the appeal which money made
to men, especially money easily earned. She waited in
breathless, almost painful, suspense.</p>

<p>'£250,000,' said Michael; 'that is a lot of money. But why do
you put such a proposition to me?'</p>

<p>'It is a lot of money,' repeated the Colonel
significantly.</p>

<p>Michael laughed. 'I suppose there was a time in your life,'
he drawled, 'when if somebody had offered you money to do a
dishonest act, you would have knocked him down? But perhaps
there never was such a time,' he said, searching the other's
face.</p>

<p>'I no more want to discuss my affairs than you want to
discuss yours,' said the Colonel gruffly.</p>

<p>'Here is the proposition'&mdash;he thumped the table
&mdash;'do you take it?'</p>

<p>Michael shook his head. 'I won't be rude to you,' he said,
'because you are an older man, and because you are going to end
your life rather miserably in a very short time.' He saw the man
wince. 'I am not saying that with the object of offending you,'
Michael continued. 'I am just telling you what is the truth.
Suppose you get away from here, how are you going to make your
escape from England? By this time every port is closed to
you.'</p>

<p>'I will tell you how we are going to get out of England,'
said Gregori. 'We are going to leave by the only route possible
&mdash;by ship from London.'</p>

<p>'By ship from London?' It was the surprised voice of the
girl.</p>

<p>'We have done a little planning on our own, Kate,' said
Gregori with a grin. 'This is our last job. We didn't tell you,
because we didn't think it was worth while upsetting you.
Everything was arranged last week.'</p>

<p>'Without my knowledge?' she said. He nodded.</p>

<p>'What do you say, Pretherston'? It is your last chance.'</p>

<p>'It isn't my last chance,' said the other cheerfully.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'That you will find out,' said Michael with a sudden
sternness. 'I warn you that your time is very short.'</p>

<p>'Your time will be shorter,' said Gregori with a sinister
smile.</p>

<p>'We will give him half an hour to think over it,' suggested
Jacques. 'Put him in the engine-room.'</p>

<p>The engine-room was the uncomfortable little shed which had
been built on to the mixing-shop to accommodate a dynamo. It was
now empty save for a truckle bed on which one of the gang had
slept. Padlocked iron doors led to the mixing-room and to the
outer world; but to make doubly sure, Garon volunteered to stand
outside the building and keep guard.</p>

<p>Michael was thrust into the little room and the door slammed
upon him.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Gregori when they were back again in the office,
'we have to decide and decide quickly. If we can be sure that
this fellow is alone, he has got to be killed.'</p>

<p>'Killed?' said Kate. 'Oh, no, no.'</p>

<p>He turned on her with a snarl.</p>

<p>'This is our job. You keep out of this, Kate,' he said. 'I
tell you it must be done, for all our sakes.'</p>

<p>'The first thing,' said the Colonel, 'is to get the gold
away.'</p>

<p>'It will be loaded on to the trucks tomorrow morning,' said
Gregori, 'and we had better keep this fellow alive until it is
gone.'</p>

<p>'Are we using our own trucks?' Gregori shook his head.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' he said, 'that would be too dangerous. I have hired
ten, from a man in Eastbourne who is used to handling machinery.
He has no idea what sort of factory this is, and I have told him
it is a preparation of lead we are shipping to the docks. Young
Stockmar will meet the convoy in London. Our own men are on
board the ship, and will load the stuff.'</p>

<p>'It is a bit risky,' said Colling Jacques, shaking his head,
'sending all that money through London without a guard.'</p>

<p>'It would be more risky to guard it,' said the other calmly.
'Our only chance lies in not rousing the suspicion of the
contractor, who has promised to come down himself to superintend
the carriage to the docks. His people won't be allowed to handle
any of it, and I have told him especially that it is dangerous
to touch the packages. Now, Kate, you must be sensible about
this business of Pretherston.'</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and leant back against the
window-sill, her hands behind her.</p>

<p>'I suppose it is necessary,' she said in her cool even tone,
and the Colonel heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'Gad, that's the way to look at it, my girl,' he said
admiringly. 'I knew you wouldn't fail us.'</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>'You said there were ten shares,' she asked presently; 'do
you count me&mdash;as the one who is sharing?'</p>

<p>'You stand in with me, my dear,' said the Colonel, patting
her on the shoulder. 'Don't you be afraid. I have never denied
you anything, have I?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'I have never been aware that you denied me anything,' she
said absently. 'When is this&mdash;' She could not find words
to complete the sentence.</p>

<p>'Pretherston,' said Gregori, 'oh, we can't do anything yet. I
think you will agree, Colonel. We must make absolutely sure that
he is not being followed and that he has not half the
Metropolitan police force within call. I shall do nothing at all
till tomorrow night.'</p>

<p>She inclined her head. 'I see,' she said simply, and then, 'I
think I will go to my room.'</p>

<p>They had made her comfortable quarters in what had been once
the foreman's office. She passed through the great sheds slowly
and stopped for a moment to look at the powerful engine which
stood near the closed doors, a tiny feather of steam at its
safety valve, then she went into her room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was ten o'clock the following morning before
any of the gang saw the girl. She had spent a sleepless night
revising her philosophies, and arranging the future as she saw
it.</p>

<p>Mulberry, who had put away his rifle and was appearing in the
capacity of an urbane general-manager, greeted Kate with a nod.
He was superintending the transference of the ingots to the
waiting trolleys which stood on the road at the top of the
chalk-pit, and was approached by a zigzag path which had been
cut in the face of the bluff by the original owner of the
property.</p>

<p>Later Mr. Mulberry climbed up the path to interview the stout
contractor.</p>

<p>'I will pay you in advance,' said Mr. Mulberry, beaming
benevolently and producing a wad of notes from his pocket-book.</p>

<p>'You have full instructions as to where these packages are to
go?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the man. 'To the Thames Docks, and I am to
hand them over to the gentleman who engaged me the day before
yesterday.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Stockmar,' said Mulberry.</p>

<p>'That is the name, sir. Are these things valuable?'</p>

<p>Mulberry shook his head.</p>

<p>'Scientifically they are of the greatest value, commercially
they are of no value. You have probably heard of dioxide of
lead, the heaviest metal that the earth holds?'</p>

<p>'I can't say that I have, sir,' said the contractor frankly.
'I am not much of a scientist.'</p>

<p>'It is a very useful element,' lied Mr. Mulberry glibly, 'in
the creation of paper. It is highly inflammable but not
explosive so long as it is handled by experts like my men
here.'</p>

<p>He waved his hand to the procession of swarthy labourers who
were coming up the hill, each bearing a package on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>'They are Italians, aren't they, sir?'</p>

<p>Mr. Mulberry nodded.</p>

<p>'They are the only people who can handle this chemical,' he
explained.</p>

<p>'I see, sir,' said the master carman wisely; 'some of these
foreigners are wonderful chaps with chemicals.'</p>

<p>He looked down into the hollow. 'Mighty nice young lady that,
sir,' he said respectfully, not knowing whether Kate, who had
just emerged from the building and was wandering aimlessly
across the yard, was an employee or a friend.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, that is my confidential secretary,' said Mr.
Mulberry.</p>

<p>'Mighty nice, if I may be allowed to say so, very
lady-like.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said Mr. Mulberry.</p>

<p>He lingered long enough to see the last packages laid on the
floor of the last truck, shook hands with the contractor with
great affability, and strode nonchalantly down the slope, and
none to see him would have imagined that he had just entrusted
nearly £3,000,000 worth of gold to the tender mercies of a
chance carman.</p>

<p>He was half-way down the first of the slopes when he met Kate
coming up.</p>

<p>'Kate,' he said in a low voice, 'if you are going up to the
top, and that fellow asks you who you are, you must tell him you
are my confidential secretary. I hope you don't mind, I had to
explain you.'</p>

<p>She nodded, and continued her slow walk until she came to the
road.</p>

<p>The cars were now buzzing preparatory to making a start. The
contractor, whom she had met before, gave her a cheery nod.</p>

<p>'Have you a piece of paper?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I've a card, miss,' he said.</p>

<p>'That will do,' she said. 'Lend me your pencil.'</p>

<p>She wrote a few lines and handed them to the man. 'I am the
managing director's confidential secretary,' she said.</p>

<p>'I know, miss,' replied the man. He looked at the card with a
frown.</p>

<p>'You are to take the trucks first of all to this address and
see the gentleman whose name I have written.'</p>

<p>'But I was told to go straight to the docks.'</p>

<p>She smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>'I know,' she said, 'but my chief thinks you had better first
go here. His lordship will either accompany you to their
destination, or he may store your chemicals for the night.'</p>

<p>He looked at the address.</p>

<p>'The Earl of Flanborough,' he read. 'Suppose he isn't there,
miss?'</p>

<p>This was a contingency which she had overlooked.</p>

<p>'Ask for Lady Moya Felton&mdash;that is his daughter,' she
said. 'You had best see her first in any circumstances.'</p>

<p>'I see, miss,' said the man, a little impressed. 'I know his
lordship. I have often seen him at Seahampton.'</p>

<p>'Now I think you had better go,' said Kate, 'before you
receive any fresh instructions.'</p>

<p>The man chuckled, swung himself into the seat of the second
car beside the driver, and first one and then the other of the
great lorries moved slowly down the white road. She watched them
until the last one had passed the crest of the hill, then she
slowly descended the zigzag path.</p>

<p>She met Gregori in the doorway.</p>

<p>'Where have you been, Kate?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'I have been to see the loot off,' she said flippantly.</p>

<p>'The less you are seen, the better,' he grumbled. 'I told
that ass, Mulberry, not to let the man catch a glimpse of you.
Don't go in, I want to talk to you.'</p>

<p>He was ill at ease, and evidently found it difficult to make
a beginning. 'You know Kate, I am very fond of you,' he
said.</p>

<p>'You have had every reason to be.'</p>

<p>'I still have,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am not so sure of that,' she interrupted, 'but go on.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean by that?' he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>'Go on,' she demanded; 'where does your fondness lead?'</p>

<p>'It leads to your marrying me,' he said. 'Your uncle does not
object, and we will be married as soon as we reach South
America.'</p>

<p>'South America!' She stared at him. 'So that is our
destination, is it?' she said slowly, 'and I am to marry you
when we arrive, by arrangement with my uncle?'</p>

<p>'That's about the size of it,' replied Gregori.</p>

<p>'And suppose I make other arrangements?'</p>

<p>'There are no other arrangements you can make,' he said with
easy confidence. 'The fact is, Kate, that you have to drop these
high-and-mighty manners of yours. We stood them very well
because it paid us to stand them, I suppose. But we are all in
the same boat&mdash;and shall be literally.'</p>

<p>He laughed aloud at the sally.</p>

<p>'You hold some queer views, you know, and we can't afford to
let you run loose.'</p>

<p>She jerked up her head, and turned abruptly away, and would
have left him, but he caught her by the arm and pulled her
back.</p>

<p>'When I say you must marry me,' he said, 'I mean just what I
say.'</p>

<p>'Have I a voice in this arrangement?' she asked slowly
disengaging her arm.</p>

<p>'You have a voice in it if you agree. You have no voice if
you cut up rough.'</p>

<p>'I see,' she said. 'I will think about it. This is not a
decision which I can arrive at in a minute.'</p>

<p>She went to her room and locked the door.</p>

<p>At five o'clock that evening her uncle came for her.</p>

<p>'Have you been to sleep?' he asked. It was curious, she
thought, how the manner and even the tone of these men had
changed in the past few hours.</p>

<p>She was so used to an attitude of deference, almost
sycophantic, which they ordinarily displayed, that the change
had come in the nature of a shock. And there was a change. Even
her uncle had dropped his mask of good-nature, and now treated
her as a child, and a child that needed to be disciplined.</p>

<p>'I have been thinking,' she said.</p>

<p>He grunted something and walked back with her to the office.
'This fellow, Michael Pretherston, has to be settled with. Do
you understand that?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied.</p>

<p>'The cars will be on the road in half an hour and you and I
will be the first to leave.'</p>

<p>'Do you think so?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' he asked sharply. 'I warn you, Kate, that
I am not going to stand any monkey tricks from you.'</p>

<p>To this she made no answer, but pushed at the iron door that
led to the meeting place and entered. To her surprise Michael
was present. In addition to his handcuffs his arms had been
bound. Gregori was sitting on the table, and made no attempt to
stand up, which was another piece of evidence that the hold she
thought she had over these men had gone, if it had ever
existed.</p>

<p>'Kate, you can use your persuasion on this fellow,' said
Gregori wearily; 'it is his last chance. He has had a night to
think it over, and he's still obstinate.'</p>

<p>The girl walked up to the detective.</p>

<p>'Michael,' she said softly, 'would anything induce you to
become&mdash;one of us?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' he said.</p>

<p>'Nothing that we could give you&mdash;that I could give
you?'</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily. 'Nothing that I would take from
you at that price,' he said quietly.</p>

<p>'Don't you love your life?'</p>

<p>'&ldquo;As dearly as any alive&rdquo;,' quoted Michael.</p>

<p>'Don't you love anything in the world? Isn't there a girl?'
she asked with a little break in her voice.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'There is a girl,' he said, and looked past her.</p>

<p>It seemed as though an icy hand had gripped her heart, and
for a while she could not frame the next question.</p>

<p>'Isn't she worth it?' she said, recovering her balance at
last.</p>

<p>'She is worth many things,' said Michael, 'but not that.'</p>

<p>She looked down at the floor.</p>

<p>'Poor girl,' she said.</p>

<p>'Having tried sentiment,' sneered Gregori, 'we will now try a
little practical argument. Pretherston, you have got about an
hour to live.'</p>

<p>'I shall die in very bad company,' said Michael with a wry
face. 'I had hoped at the least that I might die at the hands of
a lawful hangman, as you will die. To be butchered by a cheap
cut-throat half-breed is not a pleasant prospect.'</p>

<p>'Curse you,' said Gregori with passion, and struck him in the
face. He would have repeated the blow, but the girl slipped
between them.</p>

<p>'Michael, you shall die in good company,' she said in so
matter-of-fact a tone that none of them realized immediately
what she was saying, 'that is, if you think I am good
company.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' gasped the Colonel.</p>

<p>'Why, I think you will kill me too,' she said with a serenity
which to Michael was wonderful, 'because I have betrayed you
all.'</p>

<p>Garon came flinging through the door.</p>

<p>'They haven't turned up!' he screamed. 'The wagons have
gone!'</p>

<p>'Gone!' said Gregori huskily; 'gone where?'</p>

<p>'I have just been on the'phone,' gasped the doctor; 'they
went to Lord Flanborough's. He has got the stuff.'</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, broken by the girl.</p>

<p>'They went to Lord Flanborough's,' she repeated, nodding her
head. 'I know that. I sent them there.'</p>

<p>The tension was dreadful; no man spoke; then suddenly Gregori
swung round on the girl and his face was the face of a
devil.</p>

<p>'You!' he grated, and leapt at her throat.</p>

<p>In that one moment all the scattered atoms of race, of pride,
of kinship united in the distorted brain of Colonel Westhanger.
His lean arms shot out, and Gregori fell headlong to the
floor.</p>

<p>'Back, you dog!' roared the old man. It was the last word he
uttered. There was a stinging report from the floor and Colonel
Westhanger fell limply across the table with a bullet through
his heart.</p>

<p>The girl, who was half fainting with terror, shrank back
against the wall as Gregori rose, his still smoking pistol in
his hand. 'You are a prophet,' he said harshly; 'you said you
would die with Michael Pretherston, and you spoke the truth. Put
them together,' he said. 'I want to think things out.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE girl rose up from the chair where she had
been sitting and crossed to where Michael lay on the floor where
they had thrown him.</p>

<p>He looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>'Kate,' he said faintly, 'always...meeting...
you.'</p>

<p>She sat down at his side, and lifting his head laid it upon
her lap.</p>

<p>'That's nice,' he murmured.</p>

<p>'Why is it nice?' she asked curiously. 'Because I make a
softer pillow than the stone?'</p>

<p>'That and something more,' he answered.</p>

<p>'What more?' she insisted.</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;because it is you, I suppose,' he said vaguely. Her
lips twitched in amusement.</p>

<p>'But it would be just the same if it were any other person,'
she said, 'wouldn't it, Mike?'</p>

<p>He looked up at her.</p>

<p>'Put your hand on my forehead,' he said.</p>

<p>'Like this?' She laid her soft palm against his throbbing
head.</p>

<p>'What does that do?' she asked after a long interval of
silence.</p>

<p>'It just makes my head better&mdash;don't ask a lot of
questions.'</p>

<p>Her fingers stole down his face, and she gently pinched his
nose.</p>

<p>'Oh, Kate,' he murmured sleepily, 'I was just going to
sleep.'</p>

<p>'Then don't,' she said; 'what is the use of dozing?&mdash;
you'll be dead soon and so will I.'</p>

<p>She said this very calmly, in the same matter-of-fact tone in
which she might have announced that there would be roast chicken
for dinner.</p>

<p>'I hope they will kill you first,' she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'You're a bloodthirsty little beggar,' said Michael
indignantly. 'Why do you wish that?'</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and went on pressing back the
hair from his forehead, never taking her eyes from his face.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she said at last, 'only I want to make sure
that you're gone and nobody else can have you&mdash;and then I
shan't care.'</p>

<p>He did not move; for a second she saw his eyelids quiver, but
he lay still staring past her to the dingy roof of the
engine-house.</p>

<p>'Say that again,' he whispered.</p>

<p>'Say what again? That I want you to be killed first?' she
asked innocently. 'Mike,' she said suddenly, 'who was the
girl?'</p>

<p>'Which girl?'</p>

<p>'You know,' she said, 'the girl you&mdash;care about.'</p>

<p>'Why you, of course,' he said in surprise.</p>

<p>Her hand slipped down from his forehead and covered his
eyes.</p>

<p>'Say that again,' she mimicked.</p>

<p>'You,' he repeated, 'you see I am more obliging than you
were.'</p>

<p>'And you would not come in with us, not even for me?'</p>

<p>'Not even for you.'</p>

<p>She did not speak for some time.</p>

<p>'How did you know we were here?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I knew you could be nowhere else,' he said.</p>

<p>'You are an awfully arrogant young man, aren't you? Do you
know how it was all done?'</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'The train ran into the tunnel where you had a long motor-car
mounted with flanged wheels, and having three green lamps on the
front, and two red-tail-lamps behind. That was the
&ldquo;train&rdquo; which the signalman saw dashing through the
rain, and you had a horrible siren.'</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>'It was terrible wasn't it?' she admitted. 'Do you remember
that day you were in Crime Street, you heard it?'</p>

<p>He recalled the uncanny sound which had then excited his
curiosity.</p>

<p>'When you got to the level crossing gates, the car was lifted
off the rail and went on to the road. It followed the tram lines
for some distance, where it turned into a convenient garage,
which I suppose you had already arranged for?'</p>

<p>'That's right,' she nodded.</p>

<p>'The train went no farther than the tunnel. It then backed on
to a side-track. Gregori had his Italian workmen ready and fixed
up the buffer which had been dropped&mdash;you know the rest.
The hole behind the buffer and the green scum&mdash;that was
your idea, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'It was cunning, wasn't it, and did you see the rust I
made?'</p>

<p>'It is a fortunate thing you are dying young, Kate,' he said;
'you have a criminal mind.'</p>

<p>'But I haven't a criminal mind,' she protested; 'it is a
game, a sort of highly complicated jig-saw puzzle. Do you ever
read detective stories?'</p>

<p>'Very seldom.'</p>

<p>'But you have read them?' she persisted.</p>

<p>'I have read one or two,' he confessed.</p>

<p>'Did the men who wrote those have criminal minds? It was a
game to them. It was a game to me. I know it is all wrong,
horribly wrong, but I never thought I should realize that much.
I thought nothing would turn me.'</p>

<p>'And what has turned you?' he asked.</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>'I don't know what it is,' she said, shaking her head. 'It is
a curious feeling that I get when I meet one man in the world. A
feeling that makes my heart turn to ice, and makes me tremble.
That is all it is, Mike&mdash;how do you think they are going
to do it?'</p>

<p>Her thoughts had gone back to the approaching end. 'Heaven
knows,' said Michael. 'I haven't any time to think of it. I am
thinking of something else. Why do they keep the steam up in
that engine?' he asked.</p>

<p>'It was Gregori's idea,' she said. 'He had the hole filled in
today, and the buffer taken down. He thought it might be useful
to let the engine run on to the main line and block it. That is,
if we had word that they were sending a lot of police down to
search this part of the country.'</p>

<p>'Here they are,' said Michael. 'Help me to sit up.'</p>

<p>She raised him to a sitting position as the door opened, and
a dim figure appeared silhouetted against the dusk. It struck a
match and lit a candle, and Dr. Garon was revealed. He placed
the candle carefully upon the floor just behind the half-closed
door, and passed slowly over to where Michael lay.</p>

<p>'Well, my young sleuth,' he said pleasantly, 'the best of
friends must part.'</p>

<p>'Fortunately,' said Michael, 'I do not fall into the category
of your friends.'</p>

<p>The doctor hummed a little tune as he took a small leather
case from his pack.</p>

<p>'You have seen a hypodermic syringe before, I suppose.'</p>

<p>He held up the tiny instrument. 'I am going to give you a
slight dope, which won't hurt you.'</p>

<p>'One moment,' said Michael, 'do I understand that this dope
is&mdash;final?'</p>

<p>The doctor bowed. From his heightened colour and his unsteady
hand Michael guessed he had been drinking, either to give
himself nerve for his task or to drown the memory of his
misfortune.</p>

<p>'Very good,' said Michael. He looked up at the girl and
raised his face, and Kate stooped and kissed him on the
lips.</p>

<p>'That is it, it is,' said the doctor unpleasantly. 'Gregori
will be pleased.'</p>

<p>He caught the manacled wrists of the prisoner and pulled back
his sleeve, and the girl's heart almost ceased to beat.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that the light went out.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' said the doctor, releasing his grip of
Michael's arm and turning quickly. He took a groping step
forward through the darkness.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' he said again, and they heard a soft thud
followed by the sound that a body might make when it struck the
ground. Michael caught his breath. Suddenly a beam of light
danced in the room and focused upon the prostrate figure of Dr.
Garon.</p>

<p>'Got him,' said a well-satisfied voice.</p>

<p>'Barr,' whispered Michael, 'where did you spring from?'</p>

<p>'I came through the door,' said the voice. 'Did you see it
open? That is what knocked the candle over.'</p>

<p>He flashed the light on his superior.</p>

<p>'They have got the bracelets on you, sir,' he chuckled
softly, took a key from his pocket and with a few deft turns
released the other. His pocket-knife finished the work. Michael
stretched his cramped limbs.</p>

<p>'I tried to get in last night, but they had too many
sentries&mdash;I couldn't come here or get back to a telephone.
I have been lying on that hillside all last night, and all
today,' said Detective-sergeant Barr. 'I dared not move until it
was dark. I tell you, sir, I had a bit of a fright. I thought
they would get away.'</p>

<p>'Have you a revolver?' asked his chief. The man slipped a
weapon into his hand. They made their way softly back through
the room where the engine was still smoking, through the little
steel door of the office. It was empty save for a shrouded
figure which lay beneath the table. There was a second door in
the room. Michael tried this. It was locked. He heard voices and
tapped at the door.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' said Gregori.</p>

<p>'Open the door,' said Michael.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' demanded Gregori again.</p>

<p>'Open, in the name of the law,' said Michael. He heard a
shuffle of feet and an oath and stood waiting, his pistol
extended, but the door did not open.</p>

<p>A sudden silence came. 'Is there any way out of here?'</p>

<p>'There is a door leading into the shed where the engine is,'
said the girl.</p>

<p>She was white and trembling...that shrouded figure under
the table had been the last straw.</p>

<p>Michael dashed out into the shed, but it was too late. As his
feet crossed the foothold a bullet struck the steel door and
ricocheted to the roof. In the dim light offered by an oil flare
he saw Mulberry and Stockmar hoisting the inanimate figure of
Dr. Garon to the cab of the engine. He fired twice, and
Cunningham stumbled, but was dragged into the cab.</p>

<p>Then with a mighty 'schuff!' which reverberated through the
building, the engine began to move toward the closed door. It
gathered speed in the dozen yards or so it had to traverse, and
then with a crash it struck the gate, splintering and sending it
flying.</p>

<p>Michael flew the length of the shed and arrived at the outer
gates in time to see the engine disappearing round the edge of
the bluff. Barr was at his side, and the two men stood helpless,
as their enemies gradually receded into the grey dusk.</p>

<p>'There is a telephone here,' said Michael quickly, 'but it is
probably laid for their own purpose.'</p>

<p>'I left my motor-bike on the top of the hill somewhere, sir,'
said Barr.</p>

<p>'Get on to it,' said Michael. He stood listening to the sound
of the locomotive going faster and faster.</p>

<p>A hand touched his timidly.</p>

<p>'Did they get away?'</p>

<p>He slipped his arm round the girl. 'I am afraid they did,' he
said.</p>

<p>He was turning back to the shed when the roar of an explosion
set the building trembling.</p>

<p>'What was that?' whispered the girl.</p>

<p>They walked back to the end of the bluff. There was no need
for him to speculate as to the direction from whence the
explosion had come, for a bright red glow two miles away
illuminated the whole country-side.</p>

<p>'Something has happened to the engine,' he said.</p>

<p>He did not know till an hour later that running at full speed
the Atlantic had dashed into a down goods train and that blaze
he witnessed was the blaze of a burning petroleum tank which the
wrecked Atlantic had crushed in its death flurry.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">'WE HAVE not been able to recognize any of
them,' said T.B. 'Do you think Kate Westhanger was with
them?'</p>

<p>'Kate Westhanger is no more,' said Michael gravely, and he
spoke the truth, for Kate Pretherston was at that moment on her
way to France, where her husband intended joining her just as
soon as his resignation was accepted.</p>

<p>'But why give up the work, Michael?' said T.B.</p>

<p>'I found, sir,' said Michael, 'that it was sapping my moral
qualities.'</p>

<p>'Your moral qualities?' said his puzzled chief. 'I didn't
know that you had any. What particular form did the sapping
take?'</p>

<p>'I found, sir,' said Michael, 'that I was developing a
fondness for the criminal classes.'</p>
