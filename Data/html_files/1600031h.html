<h2><a name="ch-00a" id="ch-00a"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<hr>

<p>TO THE PUBLIC it must appear strange that an unlettered
individual, at the advanced age of sixty-seven years, should sit
down to give them a narrative of his life. Imperious circumstances
must plead my excuse. Necessity, even more than the importunity of
well-wishers, at length compels me. I shall use my humble endeavour
to make it as interesting as is in my power, consistent with
truth.</p>

<p>My life, for a period of twenty-five years, was a continued
succession of change. Twice I circumnavigated the globe; three
times I was in China, twice in Egypt, and more than once sailed
along the whole landboard of America from Nootka Sound to Cape
Horn. Twice I doubled it&mdash;but I will not anticipate the events
I am about to narrate.</p>

<p>Old as I am, my heart is still unchanged; and were I young and
stout as I have been, again would I sail upon discovery&mdash;but,
weak and stiff, I can only send my prayers with the tight ship and
her merry hearts.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter 1.<br>
<br>
Author's Birth&mdash;Early Propensities&mdash;He Goes to
London&mdash;Is Apprenticed to a Cooper&mdash;Enters the
Navy&mdash;Smugglers&mdash;Arrive at Quebec.</h2>

<p>I WAS BORN in the small village of Currie, about six miles from
Edinburgh, in the year 1755. The first wish I ever formed was to
wander, and many a search I gave my parents in gratifying my
youthful passion.</p>

<p>My mother died in child-bed when I was very young, leaving my
father in charge of five children. Two died young and three came to
man's estate. My oldest brother died of his wounds in the West
Indies, a lieutenant in the navy. My younger brother went to
America and I have never heard from him. Those trifling
circumstances I would not mention, were I not conscious that the
history of the dispersion of my father's family is the parallel of
thousands of the families of my father's rank in Scotland.</p>

<p>My father, a cooper to trade, was a man of talent and
information, and made it his study to give his children an
education suited to their rank in life; but my unsteady
propensities did not allow me to make the most of the schooling I
got. I had read <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> many times over and longed
to be at sea. We had been living for some time in Borrowstownness.
Every moment I could spare was spent in the boats or about the
shore.</p>

<p>When I was about fourteen years of age my father was engaged to
go to London to take a small charge in a chemical work. Even now I
recollect the transports my young mind felt when my father informed
me I was to go to London. I counted the hours and minutes to the
moment we sailed on board the Glasgow and Paisley Packet, Captain
Thompson master. There were a sergeant and a number of recruits, a
female passenger, my father, brother and self, besides the crew. It
was in the month of December we sailed, and the weather was very
bad. All the passengers were seasick; I never was. This was in the
year 1769, when the dreadful loss was sustained on the coast of
Yorkshire&mdash;above thirty sail of merchantmen were wrecked. We
were taken in the same gale but rode it out. Next morning we could
hardly proceed for wreck, and the whole beach was covered. The
country people were collecting and driving away the dead bodies in
wagons.</p>

<p>My father embraced this opportunity to prejudice me against
being a sailor. He was a kind but strict parent and we dared not
disobey him. The storm had made no impression upon my mind
sufficient to alter my determination. My youthful mind could not
separate the life of a sailor from dangers and storms, and I looked
upon them as an interesting part of the adventures I panted after.
I had been on deck all the time and was fully occupied in planning
the means of escape. I enjoyed the voyage much, was anxious to
learn everything, and was a great favourite with the captain and
crew.</p>

<p>One of my father's masters was translating a French work on
chemistry. I went to the printing office with the proofs almost
every day. Once, in passing near the Tower, I saw a dead monkey
floating in the river. I had not seen above two or three in my
life. I thought it of great value. I stripped at once and swam in
for it. An English boy, who wished it likewise but who either would
or could not swim, seized it when I landed, saying 'he would fight
me for it'. We were much of a size. Had there been a greater
difference, I was not of a temper to be easily wronged&mdash;so I
gave him battle. A crowd gathered and formed a ring. Stranger as I
was, I got fair play. After a severe contest, I came off victor.
The English boy shook hands, and said, 'Scotchman, you have won
it.' I had fought naked as I came out of the water, so I put on my
clothes and carried off the prize in triumph&mdash;came home and
got a beating from my father for fighting and staying my message;
but the monkey's skin repaid me for all my vexations.</p>

<p>I remained in London scarcely twelve months when my father sent
me to Scotland to learn my trade. I chose the profession of a
cooper to please my father. I was for some time with a friend at
the Queensferry but, not agreeing with him, I served out my tedious
term of apprenticeship at Borrowstownness. My heart was never with
the business. While my hands were hooping barrels my mind was at
sea and my imagination in foreign climes.</p>

<p>Soon as my period of bondage expired I bade my friends farewell
and set out to Leith with a merry heart; and, after working
journeyman a few months, to enable me to be a proficient in my
trade, I entered on board the <i>Kent's Regard</i>, commanded by
Lieutenant Ralph Dundas. She was the tender at this time (1776)
stationed in Leith Roads.</p>

<p>Now I was happy, for I was at sea. To me the order to weigh
anchor and sail for the Nore was the sound of joy. My spirits were
up at the near prospect of obtaining the pleasures I had sighed for
since the first dawn of reason. To others it was the sound of woe,
the order that cut off the last faint hope of escape from a fate
they had been impressed into much against their inclination and
interest. I was surprised to see so few who, like myself, had
chosen it for the love of that line of life. Some had been forced
into it by their own irregular conduct but the greater number were
impressed men.</p>

<p>Ogilvie's revenue cutter and the <i>Hazard</i> sloop of war had
a short time before surprised a smuggling cutter delivering her
cargo in St Andrew's Bay. The smuggler fought them both until all
her ammunition was spent, and resisted their boarding her until the
very last by every means in their power. A good many of the king's
men were wounded, and not a few of the smugglers. When taken
possession of they declared the captain had been killed in the
action and thrown overboard. The remainder were marched to
Edinburgh Castle and kept there until the evening before we sailed.
When they came on board we were all struck with their stout
appearance and desperate looks; a set of more resolute fellows I
have never in my life met with. They were all sent down to the
press-room. The volunteers were allowed to walk the decks and had
the freedom of the ship.</p>

<p>One night, on our voyage to the Nore, the whole ship was alarmed
by loud cries of murder from the press-room. An armed force was
sent down to know the cause and quell the riot. They arrived just
in time to rescue, with barely the life, from the hands of these
desperadoes, a luckless wretch who had been an informer for a long
time in Leith. A good many in the press-room were indebted to him
for their present situation. The smugglers had learned from them
what he was and with one accord had fallen upon him and beat him in
a dreadful manner. When he was brought to the surgeon's berth there
were a number of severe cuts upon his person. From his disgraceful
occupation of informer, few on board pitied him. After a few days
he got better and was able to walk, but was no more sent down to
the press-room.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival at the Nore, a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was
sent on board for one of the smugglers for a debt. We all suspected
him to have been the captain, and this a scheme to get him off from
being kept on board of a man of war.</p>

<p>I was sent on board the <i>Proteus</i>, twenty-gun ship,
commanded by Captain Robinson, bound for New York. The greater
number of the smugglers were put on board the same vessel. They
were so stout, active, and experienced seamen that Captain Robinson
manned his barge with them.</p>

<p>We sailed from Portsmouth with ordnance stores and 100 men to
man the floating batteries upon Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>I was appointed cooper, which was a great relief to my mind, as
I messed with the steward in his room. I was thus away from the
crew. I had been much annoyed and rendered very uncomfortable,
until now, from the swearing and loose talking of the men in the
tender. I had all my life been used to the strictest conversation,
prayers night and morning. Now I was in a situation where family
worship was unknown and, to add to the disagreeable situation I was
in, the troops were unhealthy. We threw overboard every morning a
soldier or a sheep. At first I said my prayers and read my Bible in
private, but truth makes me confess I gradually became more and
more remiss, and before long I was a sailor like the rest; but my
mind felt very uneasy and I made many weak attempts to amend.</p>

<p>We sailed with our convoy direct for Quebec. Upon our arrival
the men, having been so long on salt provisions, made too free with
the river water and were almost all seized with the flux. The
<i>Proteus</i> was upon this account laid up for six weeks, during
which time the men were in the hospital. After having done the
ship's work, Captain Robinson was so kind as allow me to work on
shore, where I found employment from a Frenchman who gave me
excellent encouragement. I worked on shore all day and slept on
board at night.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter 2.<br>
<br>
Canada&mdash;Mode of Fishing&mdash;Serpents&mdash;Floats of
Wood&mdash;Author Sails to the West
Indies&mdash;Slavery&mdash;Arrives at Newfoundland.</h2>

<p>CANADA IS A fine country. Provisions abound in it and the
inhabitants are kind and humane. Salmon abound in the St Lawrence.
The Indians come alongside every day with them, either smoked or
fresh, which they exchange for biscuit or pork. They take them in
wicker baskets wrought upon stakes stuck into the sand within the
tide mark. The baskets have two entrances, one pointing up the
river, the other pointing down. The entrances have no doors, but
sharp-pointed wands prevent the exit of the fish or their
returning: if once the head is entered the whole body must follow.
They resemble in this the wire mouse trap used in Britain. Some
have shutting doors, as in Scotland, that swing with the tide. When
it is back, the Indians examine their baskets, and seldom find them
without more or less fish.</p>

<p>The French eat many kinds of the serpents that abound in the
country. Whether they are good eating I do not know, as I never
could bring myself to taste them. They must be good, as it is not
for want of other varieties they are made choice of. I often went
of an evening with my master to catch them. We caught them with
forked sticks; the Frenchman was very dexterous and I soon learned.
We often caught two dozen in an evening. When we perceived one we
ran the forks of the stick upon its neck, behind the head, and,
holding it up from the ground, beat it upon the head with the other
until we dispatched it. When we came home the heads were cut off
and the snakes skinned. Their skins were very beautiful and many of
the officers got scabbards made of them for their swords.</p>

<p>I was much surprised at the immense floats of wood that came
gliding majestically down the river like floating islands. They
were covered with turf, and wood huts upon them, smoke curling from
the roofs, and children playing before the doors and the stately
matron on her seat, sewing or following her domestic occupations,
while the husband sat upon the front with his long pole, guiding it
along the banks or from any danger in the river, and their batteau
astern to carry them home with the necessaries they procured by the
sale of their wood, the produce of their severe winter's labour.
They had floated thus down the majestic St Lawrence hundreds of
miles. It looked like magic and reminded me of the fairies I had
often heard of, to see the children sporting and singing in chorus
upon these floating masses, the distance diminishing the size of
their figures and softening the melody of their voices, while their
hardy enterprise astonished the mind upon reflection, and the idea
of their enjoyment was dashed at the recollection of their
hardships. They really are a cheerful race.</p>

<p>I can think of no pleasure more touching to the feelings and
soothing to the mind than to lie upon the green banks and listen to
the melodious voices of the women of a summer evening as they row
along in their batteaux, keeping time to the stroke of the oar. For
hours I have lain over the breast-netting, looking and listening to
them, unconscious of the lapse of time.</p>

<p>The time I had passed since my entrance into the St Lawrence was
very pleasant. In our passage up we had run at an amazing
rate&mdash;the trees and every object seemed to glide from us with
the rapidity of lightning, the wind being fresh and direct. We
passed the island of Antecost at a short distance and anchored at
the island of Beak where the pilots live. It had an old sergeant,
at the time, for governor, Ross his name, who had been with Wolfe
at the taking of Quebec. We then stood up the river, wind and tide
serving, and passed next the island of Conder. It appeared a
perfect garden. Then the Falls of Morant, the mist rising to the
clouds. They appeared to fall from a greater height than the vane
of our topmast, and made a dreadful roaring. We last of all made
the island of Orleans, a most beautiful place. It is quite near the
town and is, like the island of Conder, a perfect garden from end
to end.</p>

<p>At length our men were all recovered and the stores landed. I
bade farewell to my French master and friends on shore, and sailed
for Gaspé Bay. We were joined here by the <i>Assistance</i>,
fifty-gun ship, commanded by Captain Worth. All the crew got a
handsome treat from Governor O'Hara at the baptism of his family.
They were beautiful children, five in number, the oldest a stately
girl. None of them had yet been baptised, and the governor embraced
the opportunity of the chaplain of the <i>Assistance</i> to have
this necessary Christian rite performed, as there was not a
clergyman at the station and the children had all been born in the
Bay. The contrast between the situation of these children and their
parents, and the people in Scotland, at the time, made a deep
impression upon my mind; and I can say, at no period of my life had
the privileges I had left behind appeared so valuable.</p>

<p>From Gaspe Bay we sailed with convoy for the West Indies. The
convoy was loaded with salt fish. The American privateers swarmed
around like sharks, watching an opportunity to seize any
slow-sailing vessel. We took a few of them and brought the convoy
safe to its destination.</p>

<p>While watering at St Kitt's we got free of the smugglers. The
manner of their escape is the best comment upon their character.
Captain Robinson went ashore in his barge. The crew, as I said
before, was composed of them, coxswain and all. Soon after the
captain left the water's edge they took to their heels. One of them
became faint-hearted after he was away and returned. The others,
that very night, while search was making for them, seized a boat
belonging to the island and rowed over to St Eustatia, a Dutch
neutral island, boarded, overpowered and carried off an American
brig, and sold her at one of the French islands. None of them were
ever taken that I heard of. The one that returned never again held
up his head, as he was looked down upon by the crew.</p>

<p>While we lay at any of the West Indian islands our decks used to
be crowded by the female slaves, who brought us fruit and remained
on board all Sunday until Monday morning&mdash;poor things! And all
to obtain a bellyful of victuals. On Monday morning the Jolly
Jumper, as we called him, was on board with his whip; and, if all
were not gone, did not spare it upon their backs. One cruel rascal
was flogging one on our deck, who was not very well in her health.
He had struck her once as if she had been a post. The poor creature
gave a shriek. Some of our men, I knew not which&mdash;there were a
good many near him&mdash;knocked him overboard. He sunk like a
stone. The men gave a hurra! One of the female slaves leaped from
the boat alongside into the water and saved the tyrant, who, I have
no doubt, often enough beat her cruelly.</p>

<p>I was one of the boarders. We were all armed, when required,
with a pike to defend our own vessel should the enemy attempt to
board; a tomahawk, cutlass and brace of pistols to use in boarding
them. I never had occasion to try their use on board the
<i>Proteus</i>, as the privateers used to strike after a broadside
or two.</p>

<p>While we lay at St Kitt's I took the country fever and was
carried to the hospital, where I lay for some days; but my youth,
and the kindness of my black nurse, triumphed over the terrible
malady. When able to crawl about the hospital, where many came in
sick the one day and were carried out the next to be buried, the
thoughts of the neglect of my Maker, and the difference in the life
I had for some time led from the manner in which I had been trained
up in my youth, made me shudder. With tears I promised myself to
reform. I could now see the land-crabs running through the graves
of two or three whom I had left stout and full of health. In the
West Indies the grave is dug no deeper than just to hold the body,
the earth covering it only a few inches, and all is soon consumed
by the land-crabs. The black fellows eat them. When I asked them
why they eat these loathsome creatures their answer was, 'Why, they
eat me.'</p>

<p>I returned on board free from the fever, but very weak. Soon
after we took convoy for England, then sailed into Portsmouth
harbour and were docked and repaired. While my weakness lasted, my
serious impressions remained, but I must again confess: as I became
strong in my body, the impressions upon my mind became weak.</p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Proteus</i> was repaired we took convoy for St
John's, Newfoundland. On this voyage we had very severe weather.
Our foremast was carried away and we arrived off St John's in a
shattered state, weary and spent with fatigue. To add to our
misfortunes we were three weeks lying before the harbour, and could
not make it, on account of an island of ice that blocked up its
mouth. During these three tedious weeks we never saw the sun or
sky, the fogs were so dense. Had it not been for the incessant
blowing of the fishermen's horns to warn each other, and prevent
their being run down, we might as well have been in the middle of
the ocean in a winter night. The bows of the <i>Proteus</i> could
not be seen from her quarter-deck. We received supplies and
intelligence from the harbour by the fishermen. At length this
tedious fog cleared up, and we entered the harbour. The
<i>Proteus</i>, having been an old East India-man, was now quite
unfit for service; and the admiral caused her be made a
prison-ship.</p>

<p>After this I was wholly employed on shore, brewing spruce for
the fleet. I had two and often three men under me to cut the spruce
and firewood for my use. I was a man of some consequence even with
the inhabitants, as I could make a present of a bottle of essence
to them. They made presents of rum to me. I thus lived very happy,
and on good terms with them.</p>

<p>Nothing surprised me more than the early marriage of the
Newfoundland females. They have children at twelve years of age. I
had some dealings with a merchant, and dined two or three times at
his house. I inquired at him for his daughter, a pretty young woman
whom I saw at table the first time. To my astonishment he told me
she was his wife and the mother of three fine children.</p>

<p>In the winter, the cold on the Barrens, as the inhabitants call
them, is dreadful. The Barrens are the spaces where there is no
wood. Over these we must use our utmost speed to reach the woods.
When once there, we are in comparative comfort; it is even warm
among the trees. The thoughts of the Barrens again to be crossed is
the only damp to our present enjoyment, as we are soon in a sweat
from the exercise in cutting the wood.</p>

<p>When the snow first sets in it is necessary to remain at home
until the weather clears up. Then the men put on their snow shoes,
and three or four abreast thus make a path to the woods. In the
middle of the day the sun hardens the path, and along these the
wood is dragged upon sledges to the town by dogs. A person, not
knowing the cause, would smile to see us urging on our dogs,
ourselves pulling with one hand and rubbing our ears with the
other. I am certain it would be a cure for tardiness of any kind to
be forced to cross the Barrens in winter.</p>

<p>Numbers of the fishermen, who have gambled away their hard-won
summer's wages, are forced thus to earn their winter's maintenance.
At this time the greater part of the fishers were Irishmen, the
wildest characters man can conceive. Gambling and every vice was
familiar to them. Their quarrelling and fighting never ceased, and
even murders were sometimes perpetrated upon each other. St
Patrick's day is a scene of riot and debauchery unequalled in any
town in Ireland. I saw them myself march in line past an
unfortunate man who had been killed in one of their feuds, and each
man that passed him gave the inanimate body a blow, at the same
time calling him by a term of abuse, significant of the party he
had belonged to. It was unsafe to carry anything after nightfall. I
have been attacked and forced to fight my way more than once. The
respectable inhabitants are thus kept under a sort of bondage to
this riotous race.</p>

<p>In the summer I was much annoyed by the mosquitos and yellow
nippers, a worse fly; for they bite cruelly. They make such a
buzzing and noise at night I could not close an eye without my
mosquito dose, that is, rum and spruce.</p>

<br>
Action between the <i>Surprise</i> and
<i>Jason</i>&mdash;Anecdotes&mdash;Miscellaneous
Occurrences&mdash;Punishment for Neglect of Orders&mdash;Author
Paid Off.</h2>

<p>I HAD NOW been eighteen months on shore when I was ordered by
Admiral Montague on board the <i>Surprise</i>, twenty-eight-gun
frigate, commanded by Captain Reeves. Her cooper had been killed a
few days before in a severe action with an American vessel. On
board the <i>Surprise</i> we had a rougher crew than in the
<i>Proteus</i>; ninety of them were Irishmen, the rest from
Scotland and England. We kept cruising about, taking numbers of the
America privateers. After a short but severe action we took the
<i>Jason</i> of Boston, commanded by the famous Captain Manly, who
had been commodore in the American service, had been taken prisoner
and broke his parole. When Captain Reeves hailed and ordered him to
strike, he returned for answer, 'Fire away! I have as many guns as
you.' He had heavier metal but fewer men than the <i>Surprise</i>.
He fought us for a long time. I was serving powder as busy as I
could, the shot and splinters flying in all directions, when I
heard the Irishmen call from one of the guns (they fought like
devils, and the captain was fond of them on that account), 'Halloo,
Bungs, where are you?'</p>

<p>I looked to their gun and saw the two horns of my <i>study</i>*
across its mouth. The next moment it was through the <i>Jason</i>'s
side. The rogues thus disposed of my study, which I had been using
just before the action commenced and had placed in a secure place,
as I thought, out of their reach. 'Bungs for ever!' they shouted
when they saw the dreadful hole it made in the <i>Jason</i>'s side.
Bungs was the name they always gave the cooper.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Anvil]</p>

<p>When Captain Manly came on board the <i>Surprise</i> to deliver
his sword to Captain Reeves, the half of the rim of his hat was
shot off. Our captain returned his sword to him again, saying, 'You
have had a narrow escape, Manly.'</p>

<p>'I wish to God it had been my head,' he replied.</p>

<p>When we boarded the <i>Jason</i>, we found thirty-one cavalry,
who had served under General Burgoyne, acting now as marines on
board the <i>Jason</i>.</p>

<p>A marine of the name of Kennedy, belonging to the
<i>Surprise</i>, an intelligent lad and well-behaved, was a great
favourite with the surgeon. They used to be constantly together
reading and acquiring information. They came from the same place,
had been at school together and were dear friends. Kennedy's
relations were in a respectable line of life. I never learned the
cause of his filling his present lowly situation. As it fell out,
poor Kennedy was placed sentinel over the spirit-room of the
<i>Jason</i>. He was, as I have said, an easy kind of lad and had
not been long from home. He allowed the men to carry away the
spirits and they were getting fast drunk when the prize-master
perceived it. Kennedy was relieved and sent on board the
<i>Surprise</i>, and next morning put in irons on board the
<i>Europa</i>, the admiral's ship, where he was tried by a
court-martial and sentenced to be hanged on the fore-yardarm. His
offence, no doubt, was great, for the men would all have been so
much the worse of liquor in a short time that the Americans could
have recovered the <i>Jason</i> with ease. Yet we were all sorry
for him, and would have done anything in our power to redeem him
from his present melancholy situation. His friend the surgeon was
inconsolable and did everything in his power. He drew up a petition
to the admiral for pardon, stating his former good behaviour, his
youth and good connections, and everything he could think of in his
favour&mdash;but all would not do. He was taken to the place of
execution, the rope round his neck. The match was lit, the
clergyman at his post. We were all aloft and upon deck to see him
run up to the yardarm amidst the smoke of the gun, the signal of
death. When everyone looked for the command to fire, the admiral
was pleased to pardon him. He was sent on board the <i>Surprise</i>
more like a corpse than a living man. He could scarce walk and
seemed indifferent to everything on board, as if he knew not
whether he was dead or alive. He continued thus for a long time,
scarce speaking to anyone. He was free and did no duty, and was the
same on board as a passenger.</p>

<p>When the <i>Surprise</i> was in port Captain Reeves allowed a
degree of licence to his men, but was a strict disciplinarian at
sea, punishing the smallest fault. As we lay in the harbour after
the capture of Captain Manly we got some prize money, and the crew
were very merry. I, as cooper, was down in the steward's berth. (It
was my duty as cooper to serve out the water and provisions at the
regular times.) All my duty at the time was over and I was in my
berth along with the steward, enjoying ourselves, when a noise and
tumult on board roused us. We were not touched with liquor;
drunkenness was a vice I never was addicted to. We came upon deck.
The crew were all fighting through amongst each other in their
drink, English against Irish, the officers mostly on shore, and
those on board looking on. I meant to take no share in the quarrel,
when an Irishman came staggering up, crying, 'Erin go bragh!' and
made a blow at me.</p>

<p>My Scottish blood rose in a moment at this provocation and I was
as throng as the rest. How it ended I hardly recollect. I got a
blow that stupefied me, and all was quiet when I came to myself,
the liquor having evaporated from the others, and the passion from
me.</p>

<p>Soon after this we hailed an American privateer commanded by a
Captain Revel, and she struck. He was a different character from
the gallant Manly. The weather was so foul and the sea ran so high,
we could not send our boat on board, neither could theirs come on
board of us. Captain Reeves ordered her under our quarter. As he
sailed alongside, the weather still very stormy and night coming
on, we were hailed by voices calling to us, scarcely to be
distinguished in the rattling of our rigging and the howling of the
blast. At length we made out with difficulty, that the American
captain was going to make some prisoners he had walk overboard.
Captain Reeves, in great anger, ordered the privateer to place a
light on her maintop&mdash;instead of which he placed one on a
float and cast it adrift. The voices again hailed and let us know
what had been done. Captain Reeves called to the American that he
would sink her in a moment if he did not do as desired and come
close under our lee. Towards morning the weather moderated, and we
brought Revel and his prisoners on board the <i>Surprise</i>. He
was a coarse, ill-looking fellow. His treatment of the prisoners
made his own treatment the worse: while Manly dined every day at
the captain's table, Revel messed by himself or where he chose with
the prisoners.</p>

<p>We took convoy for Lisbon, thence to England where we brought
Manly and Revel to be detained during the war in Mill Prison. Revel
made his escape from the sergeant of marines on his way to the
prison, for which the sergeant was tried by a court-martial and
sentenced to be hanged, but was afterwards pardoned. It was nothing
uncommon for us to take the same men prisoners once or twice in the
same season.</p>

<p>We again took convoy for St John's. In the fleet was a vessel
called the <i>Ark</i> commanded by Captain Noah. She was an armed
transport. This we called <i>Noah's Ark</i>. In our voyage out an
American privateer, equal in weight of metal but having forty-five
men (the <i>Ark</i> only sixteen), bore down upon her. The gallant
Noah, in his <i>Ark</i>, gave battle, we looking on, and after a
sharp contest took the American and brought her alongside, her
captain lying dead upon her deck. Captain Reeves, with consent of
the crew, gave the prize to Noah, who carried her in triumph to
Halifax and sold her.</p>

<p>One of our men was whipped through the fleet for stealing some
dollars from a merchant ship he was assisting to bring into port.
It was a dreadful sight: the unfortunate sufferer tied down on the
boat and rowed from ship to ship, getting an equal number of lashes
at the side of each vessel from a fresh man. The poor wretch, to
deaden his sufferings, had drunk a whole bottle of rum a little
before the time of punishment. When he had only two portions to get
of his punishment, the captain of the ship perceived he was tipsy
and immediately ordered the rest of the punishment to be delayed
until he was sober. He was rowed back to the <i>Surprise</i>, his
back swelled like a pillow, black and blue. Some sheets of thick
blue paper were steeped in vinegar and laid to his back. Before he
seemed insensible. Now his shrieks rent the air. When better he was
sent to the ship, where his tortures were stopped and again
renewed.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the war, our duty was the same, taking
convoy and capturing American privateers. We came to England with
convoy and were docked, then had a cruise in the Channel where we
took the <i>Duke de Chartres</i>, eighteen-gun ship, and were
ourselves chased into Monts Bay on the coast of Cornwall by a
French sixty-four. We ran close inshore and were covered by the old
fort which, I believe, had not fired a ball since before the time
of Oliver Cromwell&mdash;but it did its duty nobly, all night the
Frenchman keeping up his fire, the fort and <i>Surprise</i>
returning it. When day dawned he sheered off, and we only suffered
a little in our rigging. The only blood that was shed on our side
was an old fogie of the fort who was shot by his own gun.</p>

<p>Quite weary of the monotonous convoy duty and having seen all I
could see, I often sighed for the verdant banks of the Forth. At
length my wishes were gratified by the return of peace. The
<i>Surprise</i> was paid off in the month of March 1783. When
Captain Reeves came ashore, he completely loaded the long-boat with
flags he had taken from the enemy. When one of the officers
inquired what he would do with them, he said, laughing, 'I will
hang one upon every tree in my father's garden.'</p>

<br>
Author Arrives in Scotland&mdash;Singular Adventure&mdash;He
Returns to London&mdash;Enters a Greenland Ship&mdash;Whale
Fishery.</h2>

<p>I NO SOONER had the money that was due me in my hat than I set
off for London direct and, after a few days of enjoyment, put my
bedding and chest on board a vessel bound for Leith. Every
halfpenny I had saved was in it but nine guineas, which I kept upon
my person to provide for squalls. The trader fell down the river
but, there being no wind and the tide failing, the captain told us
we might sleep in London, only to be sure to be on board before
eight o'clock in the morning. I embraced the opportunity and lost
my passage.</p>

<p>As all my savings were in my chest, and a number of passengers
on board whom I did not like, I immediately took the diligence to
Newcastle. There were no mails running direct for Edinburgh every
day, as now. It was the month of March, yet there was a great deal
of snow on the ground; the weather was severe, but not so cold as
at St John's. When the diligence set off there were four
passengers: two ladies, another sailor and myself. Our lady
companions, for the first few stages, were proud and distant,
scarcely taking any notice of us. I was restrained by their manner.
My companion was quite at home chatting to them, unmindful of their
monosyllabic answers. He had a good voice and sung snatches of sea
songs, and was unceasing in his endeavours to please. By degrees
their reserve wore off and the conversation became general. I now
learned they were sisters who had been on a visit to a relation in
London and were now returning to their father, who was a wealthy
farmer. Before it grew dark we were all as intimate as if we had
sailed for years in the same ship. The oldest, who appeared to be
about twenty, attached herself to me and listened to my accounts of
the different places I had been in with great interest. The
youngest was as much interested by my volatile companion.</p>

<p>I felt a something uncommon arise in my breast as we sat side by
side. I could think of nothing but my pretty companion. My
attentions were not disagreeable to her and I began to think of
settling, and how happy I might be with such a wife. After a number
of efforts I summoned resolution to take her hand in mine. I
pressed it gently. She drew it faintly back. I sighed. She laid her
hand upon my arm, and in a whisper inquired if I was unwell. I was
upon the point of telling her what I felt, and my wishes, when the
diligence stopped at the inn. I wished we had been sailing in the
middle of the Atlantic, for a covered cart drove up and a stout
hearty old man welcomed them by their names, bestowing a hearty
kiss upon each. I felt quite disappointed. He was their father. My
pretty Mary did not seem to be so rejoiced at her father's kind
salutation as might have been expected.</p>

<p>My companion, who was an Englishman, told me he would proceed no
farther, but endeavour to win the hand of his pretty partner. I
told him my present situation, that my chest and all I had was on
board the Leith trader, and no direction upon it. On this account I
was forced to proceed as fast as possible or I would have remained
and shared his fortunes with all my heart. I took leave of them
with a heavy heart, resolving to return. I could perceive Mary turn
pale as I bade her farewell, while her sister looked joy itself
when Williams told them he was to proceed no farther. Before the
coach set off, I made him promise to write me an account of his
success, and that I would return as soon as I had secured my chest
and seen my father. He promised to do this faithfully. I whispered
Mary a promise to see her soon, and pressed her hand as we parted.
She returned the pressure. I did not feel without hope. When the
farmer drove off, Williams accompanying them, I only wished myself
in his place.</p>

<p>When the coach reached Newcastle, I soon procured another
conveyance to Edinburgh and was at Leith before the vessel. When
she arrived I went on board and found all safe. I then went to
Borrowstownness, but found my father had been dead for some time.
This was a great disappointment and grief to me. I wished I had
been at home to have received his last blessing and advice, but
there was no help. He died full of years; and that I may be as well
prepared when I shall be called hence is my earnest wish. After
visiting his grave and spending a few days with my friends, I
became uneasy at not hearing from Williams. I waited for three
weeks; then, losing all patience, I set off myself to see how the
land lay. I took leave of home once more, with a good deal of money
in my pocket, as I had been almost a miser at home, keeping all for
the marriage, should I succeed.</p>

<p>The spring was now advancing apace, when I took my passage in a
Newcastle trader and arrived safe at the inn where I had last
parted from Mary. It was night when I arrived and, being weary,
soon went to bed. I was up betimes in the morning. When I met
Williams, he was looking very dull.</p>

<p>I shook hands, and asked, 'What cheer?'</p>

<p>He shook his head, and said, 'Why, Jack, we are on the wrong
tack, and I fear will never make port. I had no good news to send,
so it was of no use to write. I was at the farmer's last night. He
swears, if ever I come near his house again, he will have me before
the justice as an idle vagrant. My fair jilt is not much concerned,
and I can scarce get a sight of her. She seems to shun me.'</p>

<p>I felt a chillness come over me at this information, and asked
him what he meant to do.</p>

<p>'Why, set sail this day. Go to my mother, give her what I can
spare, and then to sea again. My store is getting low here. But
what do you intend to do, Jack?'</p>

<p>'Truth, Williams, I scarce know. I will make one trip to the
farm, and if Mary is not as kind as I hope to find her I will be
off too.'</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast I set off for the farmer's with an anxious
heart. On my arrival I met Mary in the yard. She seemed fluttered
at sight of me but, summoning up courage as I approached, she made
a distant bow and coldly asked me how I did. I now saw there was no
hope and had not recovered myself when her father came out, and in
a rough manner demanded what I wanted and who I was. This in a
moment brought me to myself and, raising my head, which had been
bent towards the ground, I looked at him. Mary shrunk from my gaze
but the old man came close up to me, and again demanded what I
wanted.</p>

<p>'It is of no consequence,' I answered. Then, looking at Mary, 'I
believe I am an unwelcome visitor&mdash;it is what I did not
expect&mdash;so I will not obtrude myself upon you any longer.'</p>

<p>I then walked off as indifferent to appearance as I could make
myself, but was tempted to look over my shoulder more than once. I
saw Mary in tears and her father in earnest conversation with
her.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to remain at the inn the rest of that day and
all night, in hopes of receiving an appointment to meet Mary. I was
loath to think I was indifferent to her&mdash;and the feeling of
being slighted is so bitter I could have quarrelled with myself and
all the world. I sat with Williams at the window all day. No
message came. In the morning we bade adieu to the fair jilts with
heavy hearts&mdash;Williams for his mother's and I for London.</p>

<p>After working a few weeks in London at my own business, my
wandering propensities came as strong upon me as ever, and I
resolved to embrace the first opportunity to gratify it, no matter
whither, only let me wander. I had been many times on the different
wharfs looking for a vessel, but the seamen were so plenty there
was great difficulty in getting a berth.</p>

<p>I met by accident Captain Bond, who hailed me and inquired if I
wished a berth. He had been captain of a transport in the American
war. I had favoured him at St John's.</p>

<p>I answered him, 'It was what I was looking after.'</p>

<p>'Then, if you will, come and be cooper of the <i>Leviathan</i>
Greenland ship. I am captain. You may go to Squire Mellish and say
I recommend you for cooper.'</p>

<p>I thanked him for his goodwill, went, and was engaged and on
board at work next day.</p>

<p>We sailed in a short time for the coast of Greenland, and
touched at Lerwick, where we took on board what men we wanted. In
the first of the season we were very unsuccessful, having very
stormy weather. I at one time thought our doom was fixed. It blew a
dreadful gale and we were for ten days completely fast in the ice.
As far as we could see all was ice, and the ship was so pressed by
it everyone thought we must either be crushed to pieces or forced
out upon the top of the ice, there ever to remain. At length the
wind changed and the weather moderated, and where nothing could be
seen but ice, in a short time after, all as far as the eye could
reach was open sea. What were our feelings at this change it were
vain to attempt a description of&mdash;it was a reprieve from
death.</p>

<p>The horrors of our situation were far worse than any storm I
ever was in. In a storm upon a lea-shore, there, even in all its
horrors, there is exertion to keep the mind up, and a hope to
weather it. Locked up in ice, all exertion is useless. The power
you have to contend with is far too tremendous and unyielding. It,
like a powerful magician, binds you in its icy circle, and there
you must behold, in all its horrors, your approaching fate, without
the power of exertion, while the crashing of the ice and the less
loud but more alarming cracking of the vessel serve all to increase
the horrors of this dreadful sea-mare.</p>

<p>When the weather moderated we were very successful and filled
our ship with four fish. I did not like the whale-fishing. There is
no sight for the eye of the inquisitive after the first glance and
no variety to charm the mind. Desolation reigns around: nothing but
snow, or bare rocks and ice. The cold is so intense and the weather
often so thick. I felt so cheerless that I resolved to bid adieu to
the coast of Greenland for ever, and seek to gratify my curiosity
in more genial climes.</p>

<p>We arrived safe in the river and proceeded up to our situation.
But how strange are the freaks of fate! In the very port of London,
as we were hurrying to our station, the tide was ebbing fast when
the ship missed stays and yawed round, came right upon the Isle of
Dogs, broke her back and filled with water. There was none of us
hurt and we lost nothing as she was insured. I was one of those
placed upon her to estimate the loss sustained amongst the casks,
and was kept constantly on board for a long time.</p>

<br>
Voyage to Grenada&mdash;Treatment of the Negroes&mdash;Dancing and
Songs&mdash;Long-Shorers Chiefly Scots and Irishmen&mdash;Anecdote
of a Welshman.</h2>

<p>MY NEXT VOYAGE was on board the <i>Cotton Planter</i> commanded
by Captain Young, bound for the island of Grenada. I was very happy
under Captain Young. He had been long in the Mediterranean trade
where he had lost his health, and every year made a voyage to the
West Indies to avoid the English winters. We sailed in the month of
October, and arrived safe at St George's, Grenada. I wrought a
great deal on shore and had a number of blacks under me. They are a
thoughtless, merry race; in vain their cruel situation and
sufferings act upon their buoyant minds. They have snatches of joy
that their pale and sickly oppressors never know. It may appear
strange, yet it is only in the West Indian islands that the
pictures of Arcadia are in a faint manner realised once in the
week. When their cruel situation allows their natural propensities
to unfold themselves on the evenings of Saturday and Sabbath, no
sound of woe is to be heard in this land of oppression&mdash;the
sound of the Benji and rattle, intermixed with song, alone is
heard. I have seen them dancing and singing of an evening, and
their backs sore from the lash of their cruel taskmasters. I have
lain upon deck of an evening, faint and exhausted from the heat of
the day, to enjoy the cool breeze of evening, and their wild music
and song, the shout of mirth and dancing, resounded along the beach
and from the valleys. There the negroes bounded in all the spirit
of health and happiness while their oppressors could hardly drag
their effeminate bodies along, from dissipation or the enervating
effects of the climate.</p>

<p>These meetings are made up and agreed upon often long before
they arrive. The poor and despised slaves will club their scanty
earning for the refreshments and to pay Benji men. Many of them
will come miles to be present. The females dress in all their
finery for the occasion, and the males are decked with any
fragments of dress they can obtain. Many of them are powdered. They
all ape the manners of their masters as much as is in their power.
It is amusing to see them meet each other; they have so many
congées, set phrases and kind inquiries in which Mama is the person
most kindly inquired after. They are as formal as dancing-masters,
and make up to each other in civilities for the contempt heaped
upon them by the whites.</p>

<p>The food allowed them by their masters is very poor. Half a salt
herring, split down the middle, to each (they call it the one-eyed
fish upon this account), horse beans and Indian corn constitute
their fare. The Indian corn they must grind for themselves on
Saturday after their day's task is done, which in general is to
bring one burden of wood to the estate.</p>

<p>From Saturday until Monday morning they have to rest themselves
and cultivate their patch of garden ground. Those who live near
seaports prefer going to the mountains and gathering coconuts,
plantains and other fruit which they sell. The slaves all bring any
little fruit or vegetables they have to spare to market.</p>

<p>The sales by the whites, as well as blacks, are all made on the
Sabbath day. The jailor of St George's is vendue-master by right of
office, and none dare lift a hammer to sell without his
permission.</p>

<p>Captain Young did not keep his crew upon allowance. We had 'cut
and come again' always. I often took a piece of lean beef and a few
biscuits with me when I went to the plantation, as a present to the
blacks. This the poor creatures would divide among themselves to a
single fibre. As I had always been kind to them, they invited me
and a few other seamen to one of their entertainments. I went with
pleasure, to observe their ways more minutely. Upon my arrival I
could hardly keep my gravity at their appearance, yet I esteemed
them in my heart. There was one black who acted as master of the
ceremonies, but the Benji man appeared greater than any other
individual. They all, before they commenced to dance, made their
obeisance to him; the same at the conclusion. The master of
ceremonies had an old cocked hat, and no courtier could have used
it with more zeal. Many of the females had cast silk gowns which
had belonged to their mistresses, and their heads
powdered&mdash;but they were tawdry figures, though no lady or
gentleman could have been more vain of their appearance or put on
more airs. The kind creatures had, upon our account, subscribed for
three-bit maubi.</p>

<p>When they dance they accompany the Benji with the voice. Their
songs were many of them <i>extempore</i>, and made on our ship or
ourselves. My small gifts were not forgot. Their choruses are
common. Their songs are of the simplest kind, as:</p>

<p class="poem">I lost my shoe in an old canoe,<br>
Johnio! come Winum so.<br>
I lost my boot in a pilot boat,<br>
Johnio! come Winum so.</p>

<p>Others are satirical, as:</p>

<p class="poem">My Massa a bad man,<br>
My Missis cry honey,<br>
Is this the damn nigger,<br>
You buy wi my money.<br>
Ting a ring ting, ting a ring ting, tarro.<br>
<br>
Missis cry nigger man<br>
Do no work, but eattee;<br>
She boil three eggs in pan,<br>
And gi the broth to me.<br>
Ting a ring ting, ting a ring ting, tarro.</p>

<p>With such songs as these they accompany the Benji. I do not
recollect to have ever heard them sing a plaintive song, bewailing
their cruel fate. This made me wonder much, as I expected they
would have had many bewailing their destiny. But joy seems on these
occasions their only aim. The dance went on with spirit. I would
have joined with pleasure, but it was beyond my strength after my
day's work and the heat of the climate. We parted in good time
without the least appearance of intoxication. I never in my life
was happier, had more attention paid to me, or was more satisfied
with an entertainment.</p>

<p>They have one rhyme they use at work, and adjust their motions
to it. They never vary it that I heard.</p>

<p class="poem">Work away, body, bo<br>
Work aa, jollaa.</p>

<p>In this manner they beguile the irksomeness of labour, but the
capricious driver often interrupts their innocent harmony with the
crack of his cart whip. No stranger can witness the cruelty
unmoved. George Innes and I were proceeding through the plantation
to inform the master the double moses was on the beach for sugar. A
black driver was flogging a woman big with child. Her cries rent
the air, the other slaves declaring by their looks that sympathy
they dared not utter. George ran to him and gave him a good
beating, and swore he would double the gift if he laid another lash
upon her. He had not dared when we returned.</p>

<p>There were two or three slaves upon the estate who, having once
run away, had iron collars round their necks with long hooks that
projected from them to catch the bushes should they run away again.
These they wore night and day. There was a black slave, a cooper
with a wooden leg, who had run away more than once. He was now
chained to the block at which he wrought.</p>

<p>They are much given to talking and story-telling; the Scripture
characters of the Old Testament are quite familiar to them. They
talk with astonishment of Samson, Goliath, David, etc. I have seen
them hold up their hands in astonishment at the strength of the
white Buccaras. I have laughed at their personifications.
Hurricane, they cannot conceive what it is. There are planters of
the name of Kane on the island. Hurricane, they will say, 'He a
strong white Buccara, he come from London.'</p>

<p>There was a black upon the estate who had been on the island of
St Kitt's when Rodney defeated the French fleet. He had seen the
action and was never tired speaking of it, nor his auditors of
listening. He always concluded with this remark:</p>

<p>'The French 'tand 'tiff, but the English 'tand far 'tiffer. De
all de same as game cock, de die on de 'pot.'</p>

<p>They are apt to steal, but are so very credulous they are easily
detected. Captain Young gave a black butcher of the name of Coffee
a hog to kill. When the captain went to see it, Coffee said, 'This
very fine hog, Massa, but I never see a hog like him in all my
life, he have no liver, no light.'</p>

<p>Captain Young: 'That is strange, Coffee. Let me see in the
book.'</p>

<p>He took a memorandum book out of his pocket, turned over a few
leaves, and looked very earnest.</p>

<p>'I see Coffee go to hell bottom&mdash;hog have liver and
lights.'</p>

<p>Coffee shook like an aspen leaf, and said, 'O Massa, Coffee no
go to hell bottom&mdash;hog have liver and lights.'</p>

<p>He restored them and, trembling, awaited his punishment. Captain
Young only laughed, and made him a present of them.</p>

<p>I one time went with Captain Young to a planter's, where he was
to dine, that I might accompany him back to the ship in the
evening, as he was weakly. Upon our arrival I was handed over to a
black who was butler and house steward. He had been in England and,
as he said, seen London and <i>King George</i>. He was by this
become a greater man than by his situation among the other slaves,
and was as vain in showing the little he knew as if he had been
bred at college, and was perpetually astonishing the other slaves,
whom he looked down upon, with the depth of his knowledge and his
accounts of London and <i>King George</i>.</p>

<p>No professor could have delivered his opinions and observations
with more pomp and dogmatism. One of the blacks inquired at me what
kind of people the Welsh were. To enjoy the sport, as one of the
crew, William Jones, a Welshman, was in company with me at the
time, I referred him to the black oracle who, after considering a
moment or two, replied with a smile of satisfaction upon his sooty
features, 'The English have ships, the Irish have ships and the
Scotch have ships, but Welshmen have no ships&mdash;they are like
the negro man, they live in the bush.'</p>

<p>The Welshman started to his feet and would have knocked him down
had I not prevented. He poured out a volley of oaths upon him. He
heard him with indifference, and his assertion was not the least
shaken in the opinion of his hearers by the Welshman's
violence&mdash;it, like many others of equal truth, was quoted and
received as gospel. It was long a byword in the ship: 'Welshman
live in the bush like negro man.'</p>

<p>Our cook having left the vessel, we were forced to take a
long-shorer in his place. They are a set of idle dissipated seamen
who will not work or take a berth. They loiter along the harbours
and get drunk by any means, no matter however base. Home they have
none. The weather is so warm, they lie out all night and are
content with little victuals. They are in general covered with rags
and filth, the victims of idleness and disease. It is nothing
uncommon to see their feet and ankles a mass of sores, their feet
eaten by the jiggers until they resemble fowls' feet, having no
flesh on them. Their minds chilled and totally sunk, death soon
closes their career.</p>

<p>The next morning after the new cook came on board, he lay so
long the captain's kettle was not boiled, nor the fire kindled.
Paddy was quite indifferent when the cabin boy told him Captain
Young must have the kettle immediately. He replied, 'Let him send
his blasters and blowers here then.' Blasters and blowers was sent
about his business immediately, and he cared not a fig. I must
confess the long-shorers are mostly composed of Irish and Scots.
The very blacks despise them. They could make a good living by
carrying water, as they could get a bit a burden. Many blacks get
leave from the overseers to do this, giving them a bit a day, and
earn as much as buy their freedom. An overseer may often have a
dozen blacks thus employed, and his master not a bit the wiser, and
the money his own gain.</p>

<p>We brought to England, as passenger from the island, a planter
who was very rich and had a number of slaves. He had been a common
seaman on board of a man-of-war, had deserted and lived on shore
concealed until his ship sailed. He afterwards married a free black
woman who kept a punch-house, who died and left him above three
thousand pounds. With this he had bought a plantation and slaves,
and was making money fast. He brought as much fresh provisions and
preserves on board as would have served ten men out and out, and
was very kind to the men in giving them liquor and fresh
provisions.</p>

<br>
Voyage of Discovery&mdash;Anecdote&mdash;Falkland
Islands&mdash;Cape
Horn&mdash;Owhyee&mdash;Atooi&mdash;Onehow&mdash;Manners of the
Natives.</h2>

<p>UPON OUR ARRIVAL in London I learned that my old officer,
Lieutenant Portlock, now captain, was going out in the <i>King
George</i>, as commander, in company with the <i>Queen
Charlotte</i>, Captain Dixon, upon a voyage of discovery and trade
round the world.</p>

<p>This was the very cruise I had long wished for. At once I made
myself clean and waited upon Captain Portlock. He was happy to see
me, as I was an excellent brewer of spruce-beer, and the very man
he wished, but knew not where to have sent for me. I was at once
engaged on the most liberal terms as cooper, and went away
rejoicing in my good fortune. We had a charter from the South Sea
Company and one from the India House, as it was to be a trading
voyage for furs as well as discovery. This was in the year
1785.</p>

<p>With a joyful heart I entered on this voyage but, through an
unforeseen accident, I had more to do than I engaged for. Our
steward went on shore for a few necessary articles just before we
sailed. He was a foolish lad, got tipsy, and the money sold him.
Having spent it, he was ashamed to come on board again. The wind
was fair, and I engaged to fill his place rather than delay the
voyage one day, so eager was I upon it.</p>

<p>The first land we made was Santa Cruz in the island of Tenerife,
where we stayed ten days getting fruit and provisions; then made
the island of Sao Tiago (it belongs to the Portuguese) where we
watered and took in fresh provisions. While here we caught a number
of fish called bass, very like salmon, which we eat fresh. The
island is badly cultivated but abounds in cattle. We exchanged old
clothes for sheep, or anything the men wanted. The Portuguese here
are great rogues. I bought two fat sheep from one of them. The
bargain was made and I was going to lead away my purchase when he
gave a whistle and my sheep scampered off to the fields. The fellow
laughed at my surprise. I had a great mind to give him a beating
for his trick, and take my clothes from him, but we had strict
orders not to quarrel with the people upon any account. At length
he made a sign that I might have them again by giving a few more
articles. I had no alternative but lose what I had given or submit
to his roguery. I gave a sign I would. He gave another whistle and
the sheep returned to his side. I secured them before I gave the
second price. With all their roguery they are very careless of
their money, more so than any people I ever saw. In walking through
the town I have seen kegs full of dollars, without heads, standing
in the houses, and the door open without a person in the house to
look after them.</p>

<p>Having watered, we run for the Falkland Islands. When we arrived
we found two American vessels busy whaling. We hoisted our colours,
the Anchor and Hope. The Americans took us for Spaniards and set
off in all haste. When we landed we found a great number of geese
ready plucked and a large fire burning, so we set to work and
roasted as many as served us all, and enjoyed them much.</p>

<p>Next morning the Americans came near in their boats, and found
out their mistake. Captain Portlock thanked them for their treat.
We then had a busy time killing geese. There are two kinds, the
water and upland. The water ones are very pretty, spreckled like a
partridge. The penguins were so plenty we were forced to knock them
out of our way as we walked along the beach.</p>

<p>The pelicans are plenty and build their nests of clay. They are
near each other, like a honey-comb. I was astonished how each bird
knew its own nest. They appear to hatch in the same nest until they
are forced to change by the accumulation of dung. They are so tame
I have stood close by when they arrived with their pouch distended
with fish, and fed their young without being in the least
disturbed.</p>

<p>We killed a number of hogs. Our doctor broke his
double-barrelled gun in dispatching one, and sold it afterwards in
China for £42. What was of more value to us was a great many iron
hoops and beeswax, the remains of some wreck. We picked up some of
the wax but took every inch of the hoops. They were more valuable
than gold to us for trading with the natives.</p>

<p>When off Cape Horn we perceived an object floating at a small
distance from the ship. Not one of us could make out what it was.
All our boats being fast, two men went down into the water and swam
to it, and made it fast in the slings. When it came on board it was
a cask, but so overgrown with weeds and barnacles the bung-hole
could not be discovered. I was set to work to cut into it. To our
agreeable surprise it was full of excellent port wine. All the crew
got a little of it and Captain Portlock gave us brandy in place of
the rest.</p>

<p>We next made Staten Island; the weather was fine, but very cold.
We stood away for latitude 23° where we cruised about for some time
in quest of islands laid down in our charts. We could find none,
but turtle in great abundance. They were a welcome supply, but we
soon tired of them, cook them as we could in every variety. Not
finding the islands, we bore away for the Sandwich Islands. The
first land we made was Owhyee, the island where Captain Cook was
killed. The <i>King George</i> and <i>Queen Charlotte</i> were the
first ships which had touched there since that melancholy event.
The natives came on board in crowds and were happy to see us. They
recognised Portlock and others who had been on the island before,
along with Cook. Our decks were soon crowded with hogs, breadfruit,
yams and potatoes. Our deck soon resembled shambles&mdash;our
butcher had fourteen assistants.</p>

<p>I was as busy and fatigued as I could be cutting iron hoops into
lengths of eight and nine inches which the carpenter ground sharp.
These were our most valuable commodity in the eyes of the natives.
I was stationed down in the hold of the vessel, and the ladders
were removed to prevent the natives from coming down to the
treasury. The King of Owhyee looked to my occupation with a wistful
eye; he thought me the happiest man on board to be among such vast
heaps of treasure. Captain Portlock called to me to place the
ladder and allow the king to come down, and give him a good long
piece. When the king descended he held up his hands and looked
astonishment personified. When I gave him the piece of hoop of
twenty inches long he retired a little from below the hatch into
the shade, undid his girdle, bent the iron to his body and,
adjusting his belt in the greatest haste, concealed it. I suppose
he thought I had stole it. I could not but laugh to see the king
concealing what he took to be stolen goods.</p>

<p>We were much in want of oil for our lamps. The sharks abounding,
we baited a hook with a piece of salt pork and caught the largest I
ever saw in any sea. It was a female, nineteen feet long. It took
all hands to hoist her on board; her weight made the vessel heel.
When she was cut up we took forty-eight young ones out of her
belly, eighteen inches long. We saw them go into her mouth after
she was hooked. The hook was fixed to a chain attached to our
mainbrace, or we never would have kept her. It was evening when she
snapped the bait; we hauled the head just above the surface, the
swell washing over it. We let her remain thus all night and she was
quite dead in the morning. There were in her stomach four hogs,
four full-grown turtle, beside the young ones. Her liver, the only
part we wanted, filled a tierce.</p>

<p>Almost every man on board took a native woman for a wife while
the vessel remained, the men thinking it an honour, or for their
gain, as they got many presents of iron, beads or buttons. The
women came on board at night and went on shore in the morning. In
the evening they would call for their husbands by name. They often
brought their friends to see their husbands, who were well pleased,
as they were never allowed to go away empty. The fattest woman I
ever saw in my life our gunner chose for a wife. We were forced to
hoist her on board. Her thighs were as thick as my waist. No
hammock in the ship would hold her. Many jokes were cracked upon
the pair.</p>

<p>They are the worst people to pronounce the English of any I ever
was among. Captain Portlock they called <i>Potipoti</i>. The
nearest approach they could make to my name was <i>Nittie</i>, yet
they would make the greatest efforts, and look so angry at
themselves and vexed at their vain efforts. We had a merry
facetious fellow on board called Dickson. He sung pretty well. He
squinted and the natives mimicked him. Abenoue, King of Atooi,
could cock his eye like Dickson better than any of his subjects.
Abenoue called him Billicany, from his often singing '<i>Rule
Britannia</i>.' Abenoue learned the air and the words as near as he
could pronounce them. It was an amusing thing to hear the king and
Dickson sing. Abenoue loved him better than any man in the ship,
and always embraced him every time they met on shore or in the
ship, and began to sing, 'Tule Billicany, Billicany tole,' etc.</p>

<p>We had the chief on board who killed Captain Cook for more than
three weeks. He was in bad health, and had a smelling-bottle with a
few drops in it which he used to smell at. We filled it for him.
There were a good many bayonets in possession of the natives, which
they had obtained at the murder of Cook.</p>

<p>We left Owhyee and stood down to Atooi, where we watered and had
a feast from Abenoue the King. We took our allowance of brandy on
shore and spent a most delightful afternoon, the natives doing all
in their power to amuse us. The girls danced, the men made a sham
fight, throwing their spears. The women, standing behind, handed
the spears to the men the same as in battle, thus keeping up a
continued shower of spears. No words can convey an adequate idea of
their dexterity and agility. They thought we were bad with the
rheumatism, our movements were so slow compared with their own. The
women would sometimes lay us down and chafe and rub us, making moan
and saying, 'O Rume! O Rume!' They wrestled, but the stoutest man
in our ship could not stand a single throw with the least chance of
success.</p>

<p>We next stood for Onehow, of which Abenoue was king as well as
Atooi, to get yams. This island grows them in abundance, and scarce
any thing else. They have no wood upon the island but exchange
their yams for it to build their canoes. While lying here it came
to blow a dreadful gale. We were forced to cut our cables and stand
out to sea, and leave sixteen men and boys. It was three weeks
before we could return. When we arrived we found them well and
hearty. These kind people had lodged them two and two in their
houses, gave them plenty of victuals and liberty to ramble over the
whole island.</p>

<p>The only man who was in the least alarmed for his safety was an
old boatswain. He was in continual fear. The innocent natives could
not meet to divert themselves, or even a few talk together, but the
old sinner would shake with horror and called to his shipmates,
'Now, they are going to murder us&mdash;this is our last night.' He
was a perfect annoyance to the others. He scarce ever left the
beach but to go to some height to look out for the ships, and after
looking till he was almost blind he would seek out the other men to
make his lamentations and annoy them with his fears of the loss of
the ships or their being deserted by them. At length we returned
and took them on board, making presents to the king and his kind
people for their unlimited hospitality. We now took an affectionate
leave of these kind islanders.</p>

<p>As the summer now advanced apace we stood over to Cook's River,
where we arrived in 1786, eleven months after we left England. Upon
our arrival a number of Russians came on board of us and made the
captain a present of salmon, who in return gave them salt, an
article they stood much in need of. One of our men, who spoke the
Russian tongue, told them we were upon a voyage of discovery. We
did not wish them to know we were trading in furs. We parted from
them with mutual civilities.</p>

<p>At the entrance of Cook's River is an immense volcanic mountain
which was in action at the time, and continued burning all the time
we lay there, pouring down its side a torrent of lava as broad as
the Thames. At night the sight was grand but fearful. The natives
here had their spears headed with copper but, having no one on
board who could speak their language, we had no means of learning
where they obtained the copper. While we lay here it was the heat
of summer, yet the ice never melted and the snow was lying very
deep on the heights. What a contrast from the delightful islands we
had so lately left.</p>

<p>Our long-boat, decked and schooner-rigged, proceeded up the
river in hopes of finding an outlet, or inland sea. After
proceeding with great difficulty and perseverance, until all hopes
of success vanished, they returned. We then bore to the southward
to Prince William's Sound to pursue our trade with the Indians.
They are quite different from the Sandwich Islanders in appearance
and habits. They are not cruel but great thieves.</p>

<p>I was employed on shore brewing spruce all day and slept on
board at night. One night the Indians, after starting the beer,
carried off all the casks: they were iron-hooped. All our search
was vain; no traces of them were to be discovered. To quarrel with
the Indians would have defeated the object of our voyage. At length
they were discovered by accident in the most unlikely place, in the
following manner. One of our boats had been on a trading excursion
detained so long, we became alarmed for its safety. Captain
Portlock sent some of our men armed to the top of a high hill to
look out for the boat. To the surprise of the men, they found the
staves and ends of the barrels, and some large stones they had used
in breaking them to pieces. How great must their labour have been
in rolling up the barrels and then in dashing them to pieces. Yet I
have no doubt they thought themselves richly rewarded in obtaining
the iron hoops. The men brought back a stave or two with the ship's
name branded on them to evidence the truth of their discovery. We
then moved the brewing place to the other side of the island,
within sight of the ship.</p>

<p>I was much annoyed by the natives for some time while working.
They would handle the hoops, and every now and then a piece would
vanish. There was only a quarter-master and boy with me. While the
natives swarmed around I felt rather uncomfortable. They became
more and more bold. The captain, seeing from the deck my
disagreeable situation, hailed me to set Neptune, our great
Newfoundland dog, upon them, saying he would fear them more than
fifty men. I obeyed with alacrity and hounded Neptune, who enjoyed
the sport as much as I, to see the great fellows run, screaming
like girls, in all directions. I was soon left to pursue my labour
unmolested and whenever they grew troublesome Neptune, without
orders, put them to the running and screaming. When one approached,
if Neptune was near, he would stretch out his arms, and cry,
'<i>Lally, Neptune</i>'&mdash;that is 'friend' in their language.
The Indians here could pronounce every word we spoke almost as well
as ourselves. This appeared the more strange after hearing the vain
efforts of our friends the Sandwich Islanders.</p>

<p>One Sabbath day all the ship's company, except the captain, two
boys and the cook, were on shore amusing themselves. During our
absence an immense number of the natives came alongside and took
complete possession of the vessel and helped themselves to whatever
took their fancy. The captain, boys, and cook barricadoed
themselves in the cabin and loaded all the muskets and pistols
within their reach. Their situation was one of great danger. The
surgeon and myself were the first that arrived on the beach. The
captain hailed us from the cabin window and let us know his
disagreeable situation, telling us to force the Indians to put us
on board. We having our muskets, they complied at once. Thus, by
adding strength to the captain, we gained new assurance and, the
others doing as we did, were put all on board as they came to the
beach. The Indians offered no violence to the ship and when the
crew were nearly all on board they began to leave the vessel,
shipping off their booty.</p>

<p>Captain Portlock ordered us to take no notice of the transaction
in way of hurting the Indians but to purchase back the articles
they had taken away that were of use to us&mdash;but they had only
taken what pieces of iron they found loose about the ship. After
having hid the things they had stolen they began to trade as if
nothing had happened, and we bought back what few bolts they had
taken. They had plundered the smith's tent in the same manner,
although they looked upon him as a greater man than the captain. He
was a smart young fellow and kept the Indians in great awe and
wonder. They thought the coals were made into powder. I have seen
them steal small pieces and bruise them, then come back. When he
saw this, he would spit upon the anvil while working the hot iron
and give a blow upon it. They would run away in fear and
astonishment when they heard the crack.</p>

<br>
Trading Voyages&mdash;Conduct of the Natives&mdash;Sandwich
Islands&mdash;Language&mdash;Nootka Sound&mdash;Ships Sail for
China.</h2>

<p>ONE OR OTHER of our boats, often both, were absent for some time
upon trading voyages. In one of these trips our boat was nearly cut
off, and would in all probability, had it not been for the presence
of mind of an American, one of the crew, Joseph Laurence. I never
was more alarmed for my safety in the whole voyage. We were rowing
through a lagoon to get a near cut to the ship. The tide was ebbing
fast, the boat took the ground, and before we could do anything to
get her off the whole bay was dry. The natives surrounded the boat
in great numbers and looked very mischievous. We knew not what to
do.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, Laurence, who knew their ways, took a small keg
of molasses and went to the beach. At the same time he sat down by
it and began to sing and lick, inviting them to follow his example.
They licked and listened to him for a good while, and even joined
him in singing&mdash;but the molasses wore done and they were weary
of his songs. We looked about in great anxiety and discovered a
small height that commanded the boat. To this we ran but dared not
to fire, even while they were plundering the boat. They could have
killed us all with spears and stones, had we even shot one hundred
of them and wasted all our ammunition.</p>

<p>We stood like bears at the stake, expecting them every moment to
commence the attack, resolved to sell our lives as dear we could.
At length the wished return of tide came and we got to the boat,
and she floated soon after. Then we cared not one penny for them.
We began to trade and bought back the articles they had stolen.
Even our compass we were forced to buy back. We set sail for the
<i>King George</i>, resolved to be more circumspect in future and
happy we had escaped so well.</p>

<p>The party who had taken possession of the vessel on the Sabbath
day, the next time they came back had their faces blacked and their
heads powdered with the down of birds. They had done this as a
disguise, which showed they had a consciousness of right and wrong.
Thinking we knew them not, as we took no notice of them, they were
as merry and funny as any of the rest.</p>

<p>While the boats were absent on a trading voyage the canoe was
sent to haul the seine for salmon. There were fourteen men and boys
in it. About half way between the vessel and the shore she filled
with water. Those who could swim made for the beach. The boys, and
those who could not, clung to the canoe. Captain Portlock saw from
the deck the danger they were in and requested the boatswain, who
was an excellent swimmer, to go to their assistance. He
refused.</p>

<p>The sailmaker and myself leapt into the water. I had a line
fixed round my waist, as I swam first, which he supported at a
short distance behind, to ease its weight. When I came up to the
canoe they were nearly spent. I fixed the line to the canoe and we
made a signal to the ship when those on board drew her to the
vessel, John Butler and I attending to assist and encourage them.
There was a son of Sir John Dick's and a son of Captain Gore's
among the boys. Captain Portlock never could bear the boatswain
afterwards. Before this he was a great favourite.</p>

<p>While in Prince William's Sound the boat went on an excursion to
Snug Corner Cove at the top of the Sound. She discovered the
Nootka, Captain Mairs, in a most distressing situation from the
scurvy. There were only the captain and two men free from disease.
Two and twenty Lascars had died through the course of the winter.
They had caused their own distress by their inordinate use of
spirits on Christmas eve. They could not bury their own dead. They
were only dragged a short distance from the ship and left upon the
ice. They had muskets fixed upon the capstan and man-ropes that
went down to the cabin, that when any of the natives attempted to
come on board they might fire them off to scare them. They had a
large Newfoundland dog whose name was Towser, who alone kept the
ship clear of the Indians. He lay day and night upon the ice before
the cabin window, and would not allow the Indians to go into the
ship. When the natives came to barter they would cry, '<i>Lally
Towser</i>,' and make him a present of a skin before they began to
trade with Captain Mairs, who lowered from the window his barter,
and in the same way received their furs.</p>

<p>The <i>Beaver</i>, the <i>Nootka</i>'s consort, had been cut off
in the beginning of the winter and none of her people were ever
heard of. We gave him every assistance in our power in spruce and
molasses, and two of our crew to assist in working the vessel,
Dickson and George Willis, who stopped at Canton until we
arrived&mdash;then, wishing him well, took our leave of him.
Captain Portlock could have made a fair prize of him, as he had no
charter and was trading in our limits, but he was satisfied with
his bond not to trade on our coast; but the bond was forfeit as
soon as we sailed, and he was in China before us.</p>

<p>We now stood for Nootka Sound, but encountered a dreadful gale
and were blown off the coast and suffered much in our sails and
rigging which caused us to stand for the Sandwich Islands to
refit&mdash;which gave us great joy. The American coast is a
hostile region compared with the Sandwich Islands. The American
Indians are very jealous, and if any of our men were found with
their women, using the least freedom, they would take his life if
it was in their power; but their women are far from being objects
of desire, they are so much disfigured by slitting their lips and
placing large pieces of wood in them shaped like a saucer. I have
seen them place berries upon it, and shake them into their mouth as
a horse would corn out of a mouth-bag, or lick them in with their
tongue. The men have a bone eight inches long, polished and stuck
through the gristle of their nose. We called it their
sprit-sailyard. We had suffered a good deal of hardship on this
coast, and bade it adieu with joy.</p>

<p>Soon as we arrived at Owhyee our old acquaintance flocked on
board to welcome us, each with a present. Then such a touching of
noses and shaking of hands took place. 'Honi, honi'&mdash;that is,
touch nose, and 'How are you?'&mdash;were the only words to be
heard. Our deck was one continued scene of joy. I was now picking
up the language pretty fast and could buy and sell in it, and knew
a great number of words that were very useful to me. There is a
great likeness in many of their words to the Latin:</p>

<p><i>Noue</i> is their word for large, <i>Maccou</i> for a
fish-hook. When they saw our anchors they held up their hands and
said, '<i>Noue Maccou</i>.' During our wintering this second time,
almost the same scenes were re-acted.</p>

<p>Having refitted and taken in provisions, we again set sail for
Cook's River, Prince William's and Nootka Sound to obtain more fur
skins. We were pretty successful. While on shore in Prince
William's Sound, brewing spruce beer, I and the quartermaster made
an excursion up the river and discovered a large space covered with
snake-root, which is of great value in China. My comrade, who had
been in China, informed me of its value. It is the sweetest
smelling plant I ever was near when it is growing. We set to work
and dug up as much as we chose and dried it, letting no one know,
for lessening the value of what we got. It was got safe on board
the day before we sailed and we sold it well at Wampoa.</p>

<p>We parted company from the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>. She had been
absent for a long time. When a party of Indians came to the <i>King
George</i>, having in their possession a pair of buckles that
belonged to one of the people on board our consort, we became
alarmed for her, thinking she had been cut off. We immediately set
sail for Nootka Sound, leaving a large quantity of salmon half
dried. After waiting in Nootka Sound, our place of rendezvous, for
some time, and she not appearing, we immediately set sail for
Owhyee, but got no word of our consort until we came to Atooi, when
we perceived Abenoue in his single canoe, making her scud through
the water, crying, '<i>Tattoo for Potipoti</i>,' as he jumped upon
deck with a letter from Captain Dixon, which removed our fears and
informed us he had discovered an island and got a very great number
of skins and had sailed for China. We watered and laid in our
provisions as quick as we could to follow her.</p>

<p>Abenoue, soon after he came on board, told the captain he had
seen Billicany, and squinted so like Dickson we knew at once Mairs
had been there in the <i>Nootka</i>. Dickson afterwards told us
Mairs would not have got anything from Abenoue had he and Willis
not been with him. Abenoue had a son called Poinoue&mdash;in
English 'Large Pudding'. I thought him well named. He had the
largest head of any boy I ever saw. His father wished Captain
Portlock to take him to England but Poinoue did not wish to go. He
leapt overboard just as we sailed and swam back to his father.</p>

<p>It was with a sensation of regret I bade a final adieu to the
Sandwich Islands. Even now I would prefer them to any country I
ever was in. The people so kind and obliging, the climate so fine
and provisions so abundant&mdash;all render it a most endearing
place. Owhyee is the only place I was not ashore in. Captain
Portlock never went himself and would not allow his crew to go. The
murder of Cook made him timorous of trusting too much to the
islanders. At Atooi and Onehow we went on shore, one watch one day,
the other the next.</p>

<p>After taking on board as much provisions as we could stow we
sailed for China. At the Ladrones, or Mariana Islands, a number of
pilots came on board. The captain agreed with one. The bargain was
made in the following manner. He showed the captain the number of
dollars he wished by the number of cass, a small brass coin, the
captain taking from the number what he thought too much, the pilot
adding when he thought it too little. He was to pilot the <i>King
George</i> to the island of Macau. From thence we sailed up the
Bocca Tigris to Wampoa, where we sold our cargo of skins. We were
engaged to take home a cargo of tea for the East India Company.</p>

<br>
China&mdash;Manners of the
Chinese&mdash;Food&mdash;Religion&mdash;Punishments&mdash;Evasion
of Duty&mdash;St Helena&mdash;Author Arrives in England.</h2>

<p>I WAS AS happy as any person ever was to see anything. I
scarcely believed I was so fortunate as really to be in China. As
we sailed up the river, I would cast my eyes from side to side. The
thoughts and ideas I had pictured in my mind of it were not
lessened in brilliancy, rather increased. The immense number of
buildings that extended as far as the eye could reach, their
fantastic shapes and gaudy colours, their trees and flowers so like
their paintings, and the myriads of floating vessels, and above all
the fanciful dresses and gaudy colours of their clothes&mdash;all
serve to fix the mind of a stranger upon his first arrival. But
upon a nearer acquaintance he is shocked at the quantity of
individual misery that forces itself upon his notice, and gradually
undoes the grand ideas he had formed of this strange people.</p>

<p>Soon as we cast anchor the vessel was surrounded with sampans.
Every one had some request to make. Tartar girls requested our
clothes to wash, barbers to shave the crews, others with fowls to
sell; indeed, every necessary we could want. The first we made
bargain with was a barber, Tommy Linn. He agreed to shave the crew
for the six months we were to be there for half a dollar from each
man, and he would shave every morning, if we chose, on board the
ship, coming off in his sampan. The Tartar girls washed our clothes
for the broken meat or what rice we left at mess. They came every
day in their sampans and took away the men's shirts, bringing them
back the next, and never mixed the clothes. They all spoke less or
more English and would jaw with the crew as fast as any women of
their rank in England. They had a cage-like box fixed to the stern
of their sampan in which was a pig who fed and fattened there at
his ease.</p>

<p>Our ears were dinned with the cry of the beggars in their
sampans, '<i>Kamscha me lillo rice</i>'. I have seen the mandarins
plunder these objects of compassion when they had been successful
in their appeals to the feelings of the seamen. I was surprised at
the minute subdivision of their money. Their cass is a small piece
of base coin with a square hole in it, three of which are a
kandarin; sixty cass one mace; one mace equal to sevenpence English
money. The cass is of no use out of the country, and when a seaman
changes a dollar he receives no other coin from the wily
Chinese.</p>

<p>I was on shore for a good while at Wampoa, making candle for our
voyage home. I had a number of Chinese under me. My greatest
difficulty was to prevent them from stealing the wax. They are
greater and more dexterous thieves than the Indians. A bam-booing
for theft, I really believe, confers no disgrace upon them. They
will allow no stranger to enter the city of Canton. I was different
times at the gate, but all my ingenuity could not enable me to
cross the bar, although I was eight days in the suburbs. The
Tartars are not even allowed to sleep on shore. They live in junks
and other craft upon the river. If employed on shore they must be
away by sunset, but may land again at sunrise in the morning.</p>

<p>The Chinese, I really believe, eat anything there is life in.
Neptune was constantly on shore with me at the tent. Every night he
caught less or more rats. He never eat them, but laid them down
when dead at the tent door. In the morning the Chinese gave
vegetables for them and were as well pleased as I was at the
exchange.</p>

<p>After the candles were made I removed to Banks Hall to repair
the cooper work, and screen sand and dry it, to pack the tea boxes
for our voyage home. One day a boy was meddling rather freely with
the articles belonging to me. Neptune bit him. I was extremely
sorry for it, and after beating him dressed the boy's hurt which
was not severe. I gave the boy a few cass, who went away quite
pleased. In a short time after I saw him coming back, and his
father leading him. I looked for squalls, but the father only asked
a few hairs out from under Neptune's foreleg, close to the body. He
would take them from no other part, and stuck them all over the
wound. He went away content. I had often heard, when a person had
been tipsy the evening before, people tell him to take a hair of
the dog that bit him, but never saw it in the literal sense
before.</p>

<p>A short time before we sailed all the crew got two months' pay
advance for private trade, and purchased what articles they chose.
The dollars are all stamped by the captain, as the Chinese are such
cheats they will dexterously return you a bad dollar and assert, if
not marked, it was the one you gave.</p>

<p>With all their roguery they are not ungrateful. One day two
Chinese boys were playing in our boat. One of them fell overboard.
The current was strong and the boy was carried down with rapidity.
I leapt into the river and saved him with great difficulty, as the
current bore us both along until my strength was almost spent. By
an effort I got into the smooth water, and soon had the pleasure of
delivering him to his father, who stood on the beach wringing his
hands. I wished to go on board, but the Chinese would have me to
his house where I was most kindly received and got my dinner in
great style. I like their manner of setting out the table at
dinner. All that is to be eaten is placed upon the table at once,
and all the liquors at the same time. You have all before you and
you may make your choice. I dined in different houses and the same
fashion was used in them all. The Chinese never thought he could
show me kindness enough. We buried our chief-mate, Mr Macleod,
whose funeral I attended, upon French Island.</p>

<p>Almost every junk has a mandarin on board who keeps order and
collects the revenue and tyrannises over the poor Chinese. They pay
money for the liberty of doing anything to obtain a living. Tommy
Linn paid seventy dollars for leave to practise as barber and
surgeon upon the river. They cure every disease by herbs. When any
sailor or officer was so imprudent as visit Loblob Creek and
received the reward of their folly, our surgeons could not cure
them, yet the Chinese barber did so with ease. Every new moon all
the men in China must have their heads shaved. If they do not the
mandarin makes them suffer for it. They have the longest nails to
their fingers I ever saw. Many of their nails are half as long as
the rest of the finger, they take so much care of them and keep
them so white and clean. They, I really believe, would almost as
soon have their throats cut as their nails. A Chinese will hold, by
their means, more dollars in one hand than an Englishman will hold
in both of his. Shaking hands will never be the fashion in
China.</p>

<p>When the day is wet or thick, which rarely happens, the Chinese
will say, 'Joss too much angry.' Then the paper sacrifices begin.
The whole river is in a smoke. Every junk, down to the small
sampan, must burn, under the direction of the mandarin, a certain
quantity of paper to please 'Joss' their god. The rich must burn
fine gilt paper, the poor coarser paper. The mandarin is the sole
judge of the quantity and quality&mdash;from him there is no
appeal. He himself burns no paper; a small piece of touchwood
serves his turn. There he will stand in a conspicuous place, and
look as steadfast upon it as a statue, until it is all burnt
out.</p>

<p>They are the most oppressed people I ever was amongst. They must
want even a wife if they are not rich enough to pay the tax imposed
by the mandarin. They are summary in their justice. Wherever the
theft is committed, there the mandarin causes the culprit to be
laid upon his back and beat upon the belly with a bamboo the number
of times he thinks adequate to the offence. If the offence is
great, they are sent to the Ladrone Islands, their place of
banishment for thieves. There they live by piloting vessels and
fishing but are not allowed to come up farther than Macau. They are
cowardly and cruel. Six half-drunk sailors would clear a whole
village; but when they catch one of them drunk and by himself, then
they bamboo him in the cruellest manner.</p>

<p>Tommy Linn the barber was the agent we employed. He brought us
any article we wanted from the city and, like his brethren in
Europe, was a walking newspaper. His first word every morning was,
'Hey, yaw, what fashion?' and we used the same phrase to him. One
morning he came, and the first thing he said was, 'Hey, yaw, what
fashion? Soldier man's ship come to Lingcome bar.' We, after a few
hours, heard that a man-of-war frigate had arrived at the mouth of
the river. They are allowed to come no higher up. Tommy had seen
the red coats of the marines.</p>

<p>They are much alarmed at the appearance of a man-of-war ship,
and they often say, 'Englishman too much cruel, too much fight.'
There were some English seamen flogged for mutiny while we lay in
the river. The Chinese wept like children for the men, saying,
'Hey, yaw, Englishman too much cruel&mdash;too much flog&mdash;too
much flog.'</p>

<p>Having completed our cargo, we fell down the river. As we came
near to the chop-house where the chop-marks are examined (the men
having many articles on board in their private trade that had not
paid duty, which the Chinese would have seized), we fell upon the
old stratagem. When their boat put off two of us fell a fighting
and we made the whole deck a scene of riot. These timorous Chinese
custom-house-officers did not offer to come on board, but called
out, 'Hey, yaw, what fashion? Too much baubry, too much baubry,'
and put back to the chop-house. By this manoeuvre we paid not one
farthing of duty for our skins which we sold in China&mdash;the
officers dared not come on board. We landed them as soon as
possible and, when once in the factory, all was safe.</p>

<p>We set sail for St Helena where we made a present to the
governor of a number of empty bottles. He in return gave us a
present of potatoes, a valuable gift to us. While here, I and a
number of the crew were nearly poisoned by eating albicores and
bonettos. We split and hung them in the rigging to dry. The moon's
rays have the effect of making them poisonous. My face turned red
and swelled, but the others were far worse. Their heads were
swelled twice their ordinary size&mdash;but we all recovered. In a
few days we set sail for England where I arrived without any
remarkable occurrence after an absence of three years, having in
that time circumnavigated the globe. We came into the river in the
month of September 1788.</p>

<p>I NOW RETURNED to Scotland with a sensation of joy only to be
felt by those who have been absent for some time. Every remembrance
was rendered more dear, every scene was increased in beauty. A
piece of oaten cake tasted far sweeter in my mouth than the
luxuries of eastern climes. I was for a time reconciled to remain.
The love of country overcame my wandering habits. I had some
thought of settling for life, as I had saved a good deal of my pay.
In the middle of these musings, and before I had made up my mind, a
letter I received from Captain Portlock upset all my future plans
and rekindled my wandering propensities with as great vigour as
ever.</p>

<p>The letter requested me to come to London without delay, as
there were two ships lying in the river bound for New South Wales:
the Guardian and <i>Lady Juliana</i>, in either of which I might
have a berth. The Guardian was loaded with stores and necessaries
for the settlement. There was a vine-dresser and a person to
superintend the cultivation of hemp on board. She sailed long
before us. The <i>Lady Juliana</i> was to take out female
convicts.</p>

<p>I would have chosen the Guardian, only she was a man-of-war, and
as I meant to settle in Scotland upon our return I could not have
left her when I chose. My only object was to see the country, not
to remain at sea. I therefore chose the <i>Lady Juliana</i>, as she
was a transport, although I did not by any means like her
cargo&mdash;yet to see the country I was resolved to submit to a
great deal.</p>

<p>I was appointed steward of the <i>Lady Juliana</i>, commanded by
Captain Aitkin, who was an excellent humane man and did all in his
power to make the convicts as comfortable as their circumstances
would allow. The government agent, an old lieutenant, had been
discharged a little before I arrived for cruelty to the convicts.
He had even begun to flog them in the river. Government, the moment
they learned the fact, appointed another in his place.</p>

<p>We lay six months in the river before we sailed, during which
time all the jails in England were emptied to complete the cargo of
the <i>Lady Juliana</i>. When we sailed there were on board 245
female convicts. There were not a great many very bad characters.
The greater number were for petty crimes, and a great proportion
for only being disorderly, that is, street-walkers, the colony at
the time being in great want of women.</p>

<p>One, a Scottish girl, broke her heart and died in the river. She
was buried at Dartford. Four were pardoned on account of his
Majesty's recovery. The poor young Scottish girl I have never yet
got out of my mind. She was young and beautiful, even in the
convict dress, but pale as death, and her eyes red with weeping.
She never spoke to any of the other women or came on deck. She was
constantly seen sitting in the same corner from morning to night.
Even the time of meals roused her not. My heart bled for
her&mdash;she was a countrywoman in misfortune. I offered her
consolation but her hopes and heart had sunk. When I spoke she
heeded me not, or only answered with sighs and tears. If I spoke of
Scotland she would wring her hands and sob until I thought her
heart would burst. I endeavoured to get her sad story from her lips
but she was silent as the grave to which she hastened. I lent her
my Bible to comfort her but she read it not. She laid it on her lap
after kissing it, and only bedewed it with her tears. At length she
sunk into the grave of no disease but a broken heart. After her
death we had only two Scottish women on board, one of them a
Shetlander.</p>

<p>I went every day to the town to buy fresh provisions and other
necessaries for them. As their friends were allowed to come on
board to see them, they brought money; and numbers had it of their
own, particularly a Mrs Barnsley, a noted sharper and shoplifter.
She herself told me her family for one hundred years back had been
swindlers and highwaymen. She had a brother, a highwayman, who
often came to see her as well dressed and genteel in his appearance
as any gentleman. She petitioned the government agent and captain
to be allowed to wear her own clothes in the river, and not the
convict dress. This could on no account be allowed, but they told
her she might wear what she chose when once they were at sea. The
agent, Lieutenant <i>Edgar</i>, had been with Captain Cook, was a
kind humane man and very good to them. He had it in his power to
throw all their clothes overboard when he gave them the convict
dress, but he gave them to me to stow in the after hold, saying,
'They would be of use to the poor creatures when they arrived at
Port Jackson.'</p>

<p>Those from the country came all on board in irons, and I was
paid half a crown a head by the country jailors, in many cases, for
striking them off upon my anvil, as they were not locked but
riveted. There was a Mrs Davis, a noted swindler, who had obtained
great quantities of goods under false names and other equally base
means. We had one Mary Williams, transported for receiving stolen
goods. She and other eight had been a long time in Newgate where
Lord George Gordon had supported them. I went once a week to him
and got their allowance from his own hand all the time we lay in
the river.</p>

<p>One day I had the painful task to inform the father and mother
of one of the convicts that their daughter, Sarah Dorset, was on
board. They were decent-looking people, and had come to London to
inquire after her. When I met them they were at Newgate. The jailor
referred them to me. With tears in her eyes the mother implored me
to tell her if such a one was on board. I told them there was one
of that name. The father's heart seemed too full to allow him to
speak but the mother with streaming eyes blessed God that they had
found their poor lost child, undone as she was.</p>

<p>I called a coach, drove to the river and had them put on board.
The father, with a trembling step, mounted the ship's side, but we
were forced to lift the mother on board. I took them down to my
berth and went for Sarah Dorset. When I brought her the father said
in a choking voice, 'My lost child!' and turned his back, covering
his face with his hands. The mother, sobbing, threw her hands
around her. Poor Sarah fainted and fell at their feet. I knew not
what to do. At length she recovered and in the most heartrending
accents implored their pardon. She was young and pretty and had not
been two years from her father's house at this present time, so
short had been her course of folly and sin. She had not been
protected by the villain that ruined her above six weeks, then she
was forced by want upon the streets and taken up as a disorderly
girl, then sent on board to be transported. This was her short but
eventful history. One of our men, William Power, went out to the
colony when her time was expired, brought her home and married
her.</p>

<p>I witnessed many moving scenes, and many of the most hardened
indifference. Numbers of them would not take their liberty as a
boon. They were thankful for their present situation, so low had
vice reduced them. Many of these from the country jails had been
allowed to leave it to assist in getting in the harvest, and
voluntarily returned. When I inquired their reason, they answered,
'How much more preferable is our present situation to what it has
been since we commenced our vicious habits? We have good victuals
and a warm bed. We are not ill treated or at the mercy of every
drunken ruffian as we were before. When we rose in the morning we
knew not where we would lay our heads in the evening, or if we
would break our fast in the course of the day. Banishment is a
blessing for us. Have we not been banished for a long time, and yet
in our native land, the most dreadful of all situations? We dared
not go to our relations whom we had disgraced. Other people would
shut their doors in our faces. We were as if a plague were upon us,
hated and shunned.'</p>

<p>Others did all in their power to make their escape. These were
such as had left their associates in rapine on shore and were
hardened to every feeling but the abandoned enjoyments of their
companions. Four of these made their escape on the evening before
we left England through the assistance of their confederates on
shore. They gave the man on watch gin to drink as he sat on the
quarterdeck, the others singing and making fun. These four slipped
over her bows into a boat provided for their escape. I never heard
if they were retaken. We sailed without them.</p>

<p>Mrs Nelly Kerwin, a female of daring habits, banished for life
for forging seamen's powers of attorney and personating their
relations, when on our passage down the river, wrote to London for
cash to some of her friends. She got a letter informing her it was
waiting for her at Dartmouth. We were in Colson Bay when she got
this letter. With great address she persuaded the agent that there
was an express for him and money belonging to her lying at
Dartmouth. A man was sent who brought on board Nell's money, but no
express for the agent. When she got it she laughed in his face and
told him he was in her debt for a lesson. He was very angry, as the
captain often told him Kerwin was too many for him.</p>

<p>We had on board a girl pretty well behaved, who was called by
her acquaintance a daughter of Pitt's. She herself never
contradicted it. She bore a most striking likeness to him in every
feature and could scarce be known from him as to looks. We left her
at Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Some of our convicts I have heard even to boast of the crimes
and murders committed by them and their accomplices, but the far
greater number were harmless unfortunate creatures, the victims of
the basest seduction. With their histories, as told by themselves,
I shall not trouble the reader.</p>

<p>When we were fairly out to sea, every man on board took a wife
from among the convicts, they nothing loath. The girl with whom I
lived, for I was as bad in this point as the others, was named
Sarah Whitlam. She was a native of Lincoln, a girl of a modest
reserved turn, as kind and true a creature as ever lived. I courted
her for a week and upwards, and would have married her on the spot
had there been a clergyman on board. She had been banished for a
mantle she had borrowed from an acquaintance. Her friend prosecuted
her for stealing it, and she was transported for seven years. I had
fixed my fancy upon her from the moment I knocked the rivet out of
her irons upon my anvil, and as firmly resolved to bring her back
to England when her time was out, my lawful wife, as ever I did
intend anything in my life. She bore me a son in our voyage out.
What is become of her, whether she is dead or alive, I know not.
That I do not is no fault of mine, as my narrative will show.</p>

<p>But to proceed. We soon found that we had a troublesome cargo,
yet not dangerous or very mischievous&mdash;as I may say, more
noise than danger. When any of them, such as Nance Ferrel who was
ever making disturbance, became very troublesome we confined them
down in the hold and put on the hatch. This, we were soon
convinced, had no effect as they became in turns outrageous, on
purpose to be confined. Our agent and the captain wondered at the
change in their behaviour. I, as steward, found it out by accident.
As I was overhauling the stores in the hold I came upon a hogshead
of bottled porter with a hole in the side of it and, in place of
full, there were nothing but empty bottles in it. Another was begun
and more than a box of candles had been carried off. I immediately
told the captain, who now found out the cause of the late
insubordination and desire of confinement.</p>

<p>We were forced to change the manner of punishing them. I was
desired by the agent Lieutenant <i>Edgar</i>, who was an old
lieutenant of Cook's, to take a flour barrel and cut a hole in the
top for their head and one on each side for their arms. This we
called a wooden jacket. Next morning, Nance Ferrel, as usual, came
to the door of the cabin and began to abuse the agent and captain.
They desired her to go away between decks and be quiet. She became
worse in her abuse, wishing to be confined and sent to the hold,
but to her mortification the jacket was produced, and two men
brought her upon deck and put it on. She laughed and capered about
for a while, and made light of it. One of her comrades lighted a
pipe and gave it her. She walked about strutting and smoking the
tobacco, and making the others laugh at the droll figure she made.
She walked a minuet, her head moving from side to side like a
turtle.</p>

<p>The agent was resolved she should be heartily tired, and feel in
all its force the disagreeableness of her present situation. She
could only walk or stand&mdash;to sit or lie down was out of her
power. She began to get weary and begged to be released. The agent
would not until she asked his pardon, and promised amendment in
future. This she did in humble terms before evening, but in a few
days was as bad as ever. There was no taming her by gentle means.
We were forced to tie her up like a man, and give her one dozen
with the cat-o'-nine-tails, and assure her of a clawing every
offence. This alone reduced her to any kind of order.</p>

<p>How great was the contrast between her and Mary Rose. Mary was a
timid modest girl who never joined in the ribaldry of the rest,
neither did she take up with any man upon the voyage. She was a
wealthy farmer's daughter who had been seduced under promise of
marriage by an officer, and had eloped with him from her father's
house. They were living together in Lincoln when the officer was
forced to go abroad and leave her. He, before he went, boarded her
with their landlady, an infamous character, who, to obtain the
board she had received in advance without maintaining the
unfortunate girl, swore she had robbed her of several articles.
Poor Mary was condemned by her perjury and sentenced to be
transported. She had disgraced her friends and dared not apply to
them in her distress. She had set the opinions of the world at
defiance by her elopement, and there was no one in it who appeared
to befriend her, while in all its bitterness she drank the cup of
her own mixing. After the departure of the <i>Lady Juliana</i> her
relations had discovered the fate of their lost and ruined Mary. By
their exertions the whole scene of the landlady's villainy was
exposed, and she stood in the pillory at Lincoln for her
perjury.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival we found a pardon lying at Port Jackson, and a
chest of excellent clothes sent by the magistrates for her use in
the voyage home. She lodged all the time I was there in the
governor's house and every day I took her allowance to her. She was
to sail in the first ship for London direct, the <i>Lady
Juliana</i> being bound for China. During the tedious voyage out I
took her under my protection. Sarah and she were acquaint before
they saw each other in misfortune. Mary washed the clothes and did
any little thing for Sarah when she was confined, which she was
long before we reached Port Jackson.</p>

<p>The first place we stopped at was Santa Cruz in the island of
Tenerife for water. As we used a great quantity the agent, at the
captain's request, had laid in tea and sugar in place of beef or
pork allowed by government. We boiled a large kettle of water that
served the whole convicts and crew every night and morning. We
allowed them water for washing their clothes, any quantity they
chose, while in port. Many times they would use four and five
boatloads in one day.</p>

<p>We did not restrain the people on shore from coming on board
through the day. The captains and seamen who were in port at the
time paid us many visits. Mrs Barnsley bought a cask of wine and
got it on board with the agent's leave. She was very kind to her
fellow convicts who were poor. They were all anxious to serve her.
She was as a queen among them.</p>

<p>We had a number of Jewesses on board. One, Sarah Sabolah, had a
crucifix, and the others soon got them and passed themselves for
Roman Catholics, by which means they got many presents from the
people on shore and laid up a large stock for sea.</p>

<p>We next stood for Sao Tiago, accompanied by two slave ships from
Santa Cruz to Sao Tiago, who sailed thus far out of their course
for the sake of the ladies. They came on board every day when the
weather would permit. At length they stood for the coast to pick up
their cargo of human misery. We watered again and made all clear
for a new start. Our Jewesses played off the same farce with their
crucifixes, and with equal success. We then stood for Rio de
Janeiro where we lay eight weeks taking in coffee and sugar, our
old stock being now reduced very low. I was employed on shore
repairing flour casks to receive it. The Jewesses made here a good
harvest, and the ladies had a constant run of visitors. I had
received fifty suits of child-bed linen for their use&mdash;they
were a present from the ladies of England. I here served out twenty
suits. Mrs Barnsley acted as midwife and was to practise at Port
Jackson, but there was no clergyman on board. When in port the
ladies fitted up a kind of tent for themselves.</p>

<p>In crossing the line we had the best sport I ever witnessed upon
the same occasion. We had caught a porpoise the day before the
ceremony which we skinned to make a dress for Neptune with the tail
stuffed. When he came on deck he looked the best representation of
a merman I ever saw, painted, with a large swab upon his head for a
wig. Not a man in the ship could have known him. One of the
convicts fainted, she was so much alarmed at his appearance, and
had a miscarriage after. Neptune made the boys confess their amours
to him, and I was really astonished at the number. I will not
describe the ceremony to fatigue the reader, as it has been often
described by others.</p>

<p>From Rio de Janeiro we sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, where
we took on board seventy-three ewes and a ram for the settlement.
We were detained a long time here as we found that the Guardian had
struck upon an island of ice, and was so severely injured that she
was deserted by most of her crew, who were never heard of
afterwards. The captain and those who remained with him in the ship
were only saved by being towed into the Cape by an American vessel.
What detained us was the packing of flour and other necessaries for
the colony, as we knew it must be in great want, the Guardian being
loaded with supplies for it.</p>

<p>At length we sailed for Port Jackson. We made one of the
convicts shepherdess, who was so fortunate in her charge of the
flock as not to lose one. While we lay at the Cape we had a narrow
escape from destruction by fire. The carpenter allowed the
pitch-pot to boil over upon the deck, and the flames rose in an
alarming manner. The shrieks of the women were dreadful, and the
confusion they made running about drove everyone stupid. I ran to
my berth, seized a pair of blankets to keep it down until the
others drowned it with water. Captain Aitkin made me a handsome
present for my exertions.</p>

<p>The captain had a quantity of linen on board, and during the
voyage had kept above twenty of the convicts making shirts to sell
at Port Jackson. He got them made cheap and sold them to great
advantage upon our arrival as the people of the colony were in want
of every necessity.</p>

<p>At length, almost to our sorrow, we made the land upon the 3rd
of June 1790, just one year all but one day from our leaving the
river. We landed all our convicts safe. My charge as steward did
not expire for six weeks after our arrival, as the captain, by
agreement, was bound to victual them during that time. It is a fine
country and everything thrives well in it. A sergeant of marines
supplied the <i>Lady Juliana</i> with potatoes and garden stuffs
for half a crown a day. There were thirty-six people on board and
we had as much as we could use. There were only two natives in the
town at the time, a boy and a girl. These had been brought in by a
party of the settlers, having been left by their parents. I saw but
little of the colony, as my time was fully occupied in my duties as
steward, and any moments I could spare I gave them to Sarah.</p>

<p>The days flew on eagles' wings, for we dreaded the hour of
separation which at length arrived. It was not without the aid of
the military we were brought on board. I offered to lose my wages
but we were short of hands, one man having been left sick at Rio de
Janeiro, and we had lost our carpenter who fell overboard. The
captain could not spare a man and requested the aid of the
governor. I thus was forced to leave Sarah, but we exchanged faith.
She promised to remain true, and I promised to return when her time
expired and bring her back to England.</p>

<p>I wished to have stolen her away, but this was impossible, the
convicts were so strictly guarded by the marines. There were no
soldiers in the colony at this time. With a heavy heart I bade
adieu to Port Jackson, resolved to return as soon as I reached
England. We would have remained some time longer, but Captain
Aitkin was very unwell and the mate was anxious to complete the
voyage.</p>

<p>They have an herb in the colony they call sweet tea. It is
infused and drank like the China tea. I liked it much. It requires
no sugar and is both a bitter and a sweet. There was an old female
convict, her hair quite grey with age, her face shrivelled, who was
suckling a child she had borne in the colony. Everyone went to see
her, and I among the rest. It was a strange sight. Her hair was
quite white. Her fecundity was ascribed to the sweet tea. I brought
away with me two bags of it as presents to my friends, but two of
our men became very ill of the scurvy and I allowed them the use of
it, which soon cured them but reduced my store. When we came to
China I showed it to my Chinese friends, and they bought it with
avidity and importuned me for it and a quantity of the seed I had
likewise preserved. I let them have the seed, and only brought a
small quantity of the herb to England.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival at Wampoa I renewed my acquaintance with my
Chinese friends, and was as happy as I could be with the thoughts
of Sarah's situation upon my mind&mdash;but this was the dullest
voyage I ever made. I changed my berth in the ship, but all would
not do. Everything brought her endearing manners to my
recollection. To leave her a convict was a great aggravation to my
grief. Had I left her by choice for a voyage I could have thought
of her with pleasing regret and anxious hope of seeing her soon.
But to leave her exposed to temptation in the very worst company
the world could produce was too much to think of with composure. I
left with her my Bible, the companion of all my voyages, with our
names written in it. She used to read it often, when I never
thought of it.</p>

<p>So much did these thoughts prey upon my mind I almost resolved
to lose my wages by leaving the <i>Lady Juliana</i> at Rio or the
Cape. But to be so far from home, without one penny in my pocket to
pay her passage to England, would have been madness, as I could not
bear the idea of bidding for ever farewell to Scotland, the place
where my wanderings were always intended to cease. I made up my
mind to come to England in the <i>Lady Juliana</i>, and get a berth
out the first opportunity, and by that time her term of
transportation would be expired. We touched at St Helena on our way
to England. When we arrived I was paid off and immediately made
every inquiry for a ship for New Holland, but there was none, nor
any likely to be soon.</p>

Author Engaged on Board a South Sea Whaler&mdash;Miscellaneous
Occurrences&mdash;Grief at the Conduct of
Sarah&mdash;Seal-Fishing&mdash;Sea Lions&mdash;Unexpectedly Meets a
Countryman at Paita&mdash;Transactions There.</h2>

<p>THERE WAS A vessel called the <i>Amelia</i>, Captain Shiels,
fitting out as a south-sea whaler. She belonged to Squire
Enderborough, Paul's Wharf, London. I got myself engaged as cooper
of her. The whole crew were on shares. I, as cooper, had a larger
share than a seaman, but this was not my present aim, neither did I
think of gain. I had all my money secured about my person, sewed
into my clothes, ready for a start, and with it to pay the passage
of Sarah and my son to England. My intention was, when we arrived
at Rio de Janeiro on our return home, to fall sick and endeavour to
obtain my share from the captain and allow the vessel to sail
without me, or to claim it when I reached England. From Rio I could
easily get a ship to the Cape. From the Cape to New South Wales I
had the only chance of a vessel. I would have remained until the
<i>Amelia</i> reached the Cape, but she might not even anchor
there. These were my views in entering on board the
<i>Amelia</i>.</p>

<p>In two months after my leaving the <i>Lady Juliana</i> I was
again at sea in hopes of reaching Port Jackson by some means or
other. In our first offset we were stranded upon the Red Sand near
the Nore. While we lay in distress, the Deal men came out and
wished to make a wreck of us by cutting away our masts. I, with
alacrity, aided the captain and stood guard with a brace of
pistols, and threatened to blow out the brains of the first man of
them that offered to set his foot upon our deck. The weather
fortunately was moderate. We, having no long-boat, carried out our
anchor between two boats into deep water, and as the tide flowed we
got her off. To my great disappointment we were forced to put back
into dock to have her examined by removing the copper sheathing.
All the crew left her except myself, as the engagement was broken
by our return to dock, and the men would not continue in her as
they thought no good would come of the voyage. Her stranding was an
omen of her bad luck.</p>

<p>There was no ship in the river for New South Wales, and the
Indiamen would not sail until about the month of March. The
<i>Amelia</i> would still be the first vessel. I had no inducement,
therefore, to leave her. We were soon again ready for sea, and set
sail with an entire new crew. The first land we made was the island
of Buena Vista which belongs to the Portuguese, where we took in
livestock, and salt to salt down our seal skins, then stood for Sao
Tiago and took in more livestock; from thence to the Falkland
Islands for geese and swine. We next made Staten Island, and passed
the Straits of Magellan and Straits le Mair, but did not go through
either of them. We doubled the Cape then stood down to our fishing
ground which was between latitude 18° and the Line.</p>

<p>We had nothing to do but commence, as we had been busy all the
voyage preparing and fitting our tackle. Our boilers were fitted up
before we left England as in the south seas the spermaceti is all
boiled upon the deck. The boiler is built up with fire brick, and a
space left between the lower tier and the deck about nine inches
high, quite watertight. When once the fire is kindled, which is
never after allowed to go out until the ship is fully fished, the
space between the bricks and the deck is kept full of water. There
are two plug-holes (one on each side) so that when the water heats
and would melt the pitch, upon whatever tack the ship may be, the
plug is drawn from the under side and the space immediately filled
with cold water from the higher side. Great attention is required
to watch the boilers. We do not require to carry out fuel to boil
our oil, as the refuse of the oil is used ever after the first fire
is kindled. The ashes of the fire is better than any soap. Let our
clothes be ever so black and greasy, as they must be from our
employment, one shovel full of ashes in a tub of water will make
them as clean as when we bought them.</p>

<p>During the fishing we lived wholly upon turtle and were heartily
tired of them. We were very fortunate in our fishing. We caught one
whale from which we obtained 125 pounds weight of ambergrease, the
largest quantity ever brought to England by one ship. Upon the
fishing ground we found the Venus, Captain Coffin. She had taken
out convicts to Port Jackson and there was a convict on board at
the time. He had concealed himself in her until she was at sea, and
by this means made his escape from the colony. He used to hide
himself from me but, the other men assuring him I would not inform,
he had the courage to speak to me at length, and inquired if ever I
had been at Port Jackson. I told him I had, in the <i>Lady
Juliana</i>. He answered he had seen me there. My heart beat high
with anxiety. I feared, yet wished, to hear of Sarah Whitlam.</p>

<p>At length I inquired. How shall I express my grief when informed
she had left the colony for Bombay. Thus were my worst fears
realised. Unconstant woman! Why doubt my faith? Yet dear, and never
to be forgotten, I resolved to follow her to India. I could not
speak to him so broke off the conversation for the present and left
him in greater despondency than I left Port Jackson. My grief was
not then mixed with doubts of her constancy. She had only three
years to serve when I left her, and these were not yet expired. How
she got away he could not inform me.</p>

<p>Every time we met I renewed my inquiries. He was so uniform in
his replies, and assured me of its truth so solemnly, I was forced
to believe the unpleasant truth. I inquired for my son John, but he
could give me no information to be relied on. He believed she had
taken him with her but, as the children are taken from the convicts
and maintained at school by the government, he knew not her son
from the others, and did not see her go away. I now had no
inducement to go to Port Jackson and for a few days scarce cared
what became of me. My love for her revived stronger at this time
than any other since I left her. I even gave her praise for leaving
it. She did so to be out of bad company, my mind would whisper, and
I resolved to get to Bombay as soon as possible, and endeavour to
find her out.</p>

<p>As my usual buoyancy of spirits returned, I pursued my labours
with all the ardour of a seaman. After taking a sufficient quantity
of spermaceti we stood as far down as latitude 3° to the Island of
Lopes where we killed thirty thousand seals. We had a busy time
chasing and killing them. When we had a sufficient number we began
to kill sea-lions to get their skins for the ship's use. One of
their skins was a sufficient load for two men. We used to stand in
a gap of the rocks in the morning and knock them down with our
clubs as they approached the sea, then stab them with our long
knives.</p>

<p>George Parker our mate made a blow at one and missed him. He
made a snap at George and sent his tusk right through his arm, a
little above the wrist, and walked away at his leisure with him
into the sea, Parker roaring like a bull from the pain and terror.
Robert Wyld, perceiving his danger, rushed into the water to rescue
him, and was up to the armpits before he succeeded in dispatching
the unwieldy monster. He then dragged them both on shore where,
with difficulty, the tusk was drawn from between the bones, it was
so firmly jammed.</p>

<p>We soon after sailed three degrees to the north of the Line to
the River Tambo where we anchored, and the captain ascended the
river nine miles in his boat, to which I belonged, to the town of
Tambo. We had an American Indian for a pilot. He appeared to
worship the alligators as he kept constantly bowing and muttering
to them, and a busy time he had of it as they were very numerous.
The governor of the town and people were very kind and civil to us.
We remained all night at the governor's house, feasting like kings.
Captain Shiels made him a present of some porter and a cheese and a
few other things, for which he would have given us as many bullocks
as we chose. We only took one which was as much as we could use
fresh, there being only sixteen hands in the ship. We watered in
the river then crossed the Line to the city of Paita, where we
anchored in a beautiful bay, quite land-locked and as smooth as a
mill-pond.</p>

<p>We scarcely had made all tight when a boat came alongside, and
inquired if there was a Scotchman on board. The captain allowed me
to go as I was the only one in the ship. I was conducted to a
baker's shop in the town and into an elegant room, where a
sickly-looking person, but elegantly dressed, rose and met me,
shaked hands, and said, 'How's a' wi' you?' My ears tingled and my
heart leapt for joy to hear the accents of my native tongue so
unexpectedly. I looked hard at him but had never seen him before. I
thanked him and we sat down together and began a long conversation.
We talked of Old Scotland and the talk was all on my side for a
long while, he had so many questions to put, and he seemed to
devour every word I spoke while joy beamed in his sickly
features.</p>

<p>At length I got his own history. He was a native of Inverness
and had been bred to the sea and, coming to the West Indies, had
engaged in the contraband trade carried on along the Spanish main;
had been taken prisoner and carried to Montevideo; from thence to
Lima where he had been long in prison and suffered many hardships
but, being a Roman Catholic, he was not sent to the mines. He had
found means to obtain his liberty and afterwards win the love of a
rich Spanish lady who procured him his pardon and afterwards
married him. He was now very rich and had a ship of his own,
besides immense property, but having fallen sick at Paita he had
ordered his vessel to proceed on her voyage and send his servants
to carry him overland to Lima. He was expecting them every day.</p>

<p>He treated me nobly and made me a handsome present when he went
away, which he did while we lay at Paita. I was astonished at the
number of servants and horses that came for him. His saddle would
have bought fifty horses. The stirrups were solid gold, and every
part was loaded with it. The maker seemed to have studied more to
lay on gold than taste in the ornaments. He made the most enticing
offers to induce me to go with him, but Sarah was dearer to me than
all the riches in the world.</p>

<p>The governor and people of Paita were so kind to us we passed
our time very agreeably. All their houses were open to us. They
forced presents of fruit upon us, and gave us as much accadent as
we chose to drink. The governor treated us with a Spanish play.
These entertainments are through the day. During the performance we
were served with wine, sweetmeats and fruits, but not understanding
the language we paid more attention to the refreshments than the
play. The governor was one of the kindest gentlemen I ever saw. He
told us he loved the English for their humanity; he had been in the
town when Lord Anson plundered it. Ever since they do not keep
their saints and plate in the church, but in the town-house which
is no stronger than the church. You may see them carrying it back
and forward every day.</p>

<p>The governor was very anxious to learn English. I could buy and
sell in Spanish. Upon this account he took great notice of me. I
had a Spanish and English dictionary on board. I gave it him, and
he made me a handsome present he was so much pleased with
it&mdash;and he made rapid progress in his study.</p>

<p>He was the first that told me of the King of France's death. He
said, drawing his hand across his neck, 'The people have cut the
neck of de Roi de Française.' I understood what he meant, but did
not believe the information.</p>

<p>I wore in general, when ashore, a black jacket with black horn
buttons. A priest I used often to meet at the governor's took a
fancy to the buttons and offered me any price for them. I soon cut
off my buttons, and gave them to him. I had breeches and vest with
the same buttons; off went they, every one. A Jew would have
counted it a good bargain. Amidst all their kindness they are very
superstitious. I must have lain in the streets all night one
evening I missed the boat, had not a Portuguese who was with me
told them I was an Irishman. 'O bon Irelandois! O bon Christian!'
they cried and made me welcome, gave me the best in the house,
happy to entertain so good a Christian as an Irishman.</p>

<p>While everything was going on to our wish, and our ambergrease
selling well, we were forced to leave Paita in great haste. One of
our men, getting himself tipsy, told the people openly we were
selling ambergrease and had still a great quantity to sell. The
governor immediately sent for the captain and informed him of his
danger. He himself was not against the sale but should word reach
Lima they would order a frigate to Paita and make a prize of us. We
were too much afraid of this to tarry longer than get in what
supplies we stood in need of, for which the governor would accept
no payment.</p>

<p>I went with other two to take leave of the governor. As we
proceeded along we saw two ladies swinging in a net, and a female
servant keeping it in motion. We stood looking at them a few
minutes before they perceived us. As soon as they did they desired
the servant to cease, came down and bade us come into the house
where they treated us with fruit and wine, and would scarce allow
us to go away so soon as we wanted. The ladies here have a pale and
sickly look. All their movements are languid. Even the men are far
from being active. Everyone moves as if he wished someone to carry
him.</p>

<br>
Rio de Janeiro&mdash;Portuguese Seamen&mdash;Lisbon&mdash;Author
Arrives in London&mdash;Visits Sarah's Parents&mdash;Enters a
Vessel Bound for China&mdash;Anecdote.</h2>

<p>WHEN WE SAILED we had two booms over our stern, and a net made
fast to them filled with pumpkins, melons and other vegetables, the
gift of these kind Spaniards. We stood direct for Rio de Janeiro,
where Captain Shiels intended to remain for some time as he had
completed his cargo so soon. He would have lost the bounty had he
arrived before the time specified in the act of parliament. There
were a great number of Portuguese vessels lying at Rio de Janeiro
at this time. No accounts had been received from Lisbon for six
months, and it was believed the French had taken Portugal. I
counted every day we remained as so much of my time lost, and
wearied very much. At length a ship arrived from Lisbon and all the
Portuguese prepared to sail. The governor's linguist came on board
the <i>Amelia</i> and requested, as a personal favour, that Captain
Shiels would allow four of his men to go on board the Commodore to
assist in the voyage home, as it would be a winter's passage.</p>

<p>I immediately volunteered. I hoped by this means to reach
England sooner and obtain more money for Sarah, as I would receive
a full share of the <i>Amelia</i> in England the same as if I had
continued in her. Had I know the delays, the fatigue and vexations
I was to endure from these execrable superstitious Portuguese
sailors, I never would have left the <i>Amelia</i> for any reward
the Commodore could have given me&mdash;and he was very kind to us.
He knew our value, and his whole reliance was upon us. We were to
work the ship, and fight the ship should an enemy lay us alongside.
He had been forty years trading between Lisbon and Rio de Janeiro,
and in all that time never had made a winter's voyage.</p>

<p>The Portuguese are the worst sailors in the world in rough or
cold weather, and we had plenty of both, but worse than all we had
a black fellow of a priest on board to whom the crew paid more
attention than the captain. He was for ever ringing his bell for
mass and sprinkling holy water upon the men. Whenever it blew
harder than ordinary they were sure to run to the quarterdeck to
the black priest. We were almost foundered at one time by this
unseamanlike conduct. The whole crew ran to the quarterdeck,
kneeling down, resigned to their fate, the priest sprinkling holy
water most profusely upon them, while we four Englishmen were left
to steer the vessel and hand the sails. It required two of the four
to steer, so that there were only two to hand the sails. The
consequence was she broached to. William Mercer and I ran and cut
the foregeers, and allowed the yard to swing. At the same time, the
captain, mate and boatswain hauled in the forebrace and she righted
in a moment. Had her commons not been very high, she must have
filled while she lay upon her beam ends. The sea was all over her
deck round the hatch, but so soon as she righted and we were going
to make sail the Portuguese left their priest and lent us a
hand.</p>

<p>We were wrought almost to death and never could have made out
the voyage had we not been well fed and the captain given us plenty
of liquor. The black priest rung his bell at his stated time
whatever we were doing, and the Portuguese would run to their
berths for their crosses. Often the main tack was left half hauled
aboard at the sound of his bell, and the vessel left to drift
leeward until prayers were over. As two men could do nothing to the
sail when the wind was fresh, after prayers they would return and
begin bawling and hauling, calling upon their saints as if they
would come to assist.</p>

<p>We were thus almost driven to distraction by them and could
scarce keep off our hands from boxing their ears. Many a hearty
curse they and their saints got. Then they would run to the captain
or priest and make complaint that the Englishmen had cursed Saint
Antonio or some other of the saints. I often wondered the captain
did not confine the priest to his cabin in foul weather, as he was
sure to be busiest then. When they complained, the captain took our
part and overawed the Portuguese, or I really believe they would
have thrown us overboard. They often looked at us as if they could
have eat us without salt, and told us to our face we were 'star
pork', that is, all the same as swine&mdash;that we knew nothing of
God or the saints.</p>

<p>I showed them my Bible and the names of the saints. They were
quite surprised. Had I made another voyage I would have made
converts of many of them. I was bald headed and they called me an
English padre. Often the bell rang while we were at dinner. They
inquired why I would not go to mass. 'I mess with the Coussinero,'
I replied. They began to think I had the best religion. They seemed
to think the foul weather was all upon our account, and the virgin
and saints sent it because they employed heretics on board.</p>

<p>We had a supercargo on board as passenger, who had made his
fortune in the slave trade and was returning home to Portugal. He
took unwell and died. At his funeral there were the following
manoeuvres gone through. Everyone had a candle in his hand, and all
stood in a double line upon the deck. There were even lanthorns
hung over the ship's side to light him to the bottom. The body was
carried along the double line, the priest chanting, and every one
touched him before he was thrown overboard. The captain requested
us to do as the others did. Says Will Mercer, 'Captain, I will
throw him overboard for you, if you please.'</p>

<p>At length, after a tedious voyage of three months, I got out of
this vile crew. When we reached the Tagus the Portuguese began to
quarrel and knock us about. We stood our ground the best way we
could until the captain got five of them sent on shore under a
guard of soldiers. We remained at the captain's house until we got
our wages. The owners gave us a doubloon a piece over and above our
agreement for saving the ship, as the captain did us every justice
to the owners at the time, saying, 'If the English were as careful
of their souls as they are of their bodies, they would be the best
people in the world.' I had many conversations with the captain
concerning the ignorance of the Portuguese people in general, and
asked why the priest did not inform them better. He said, 'Were we
to inform them they would soon turn the priest about his business
and rise against the government. They must only get knowledge
little by little.'</p>

<p>We assisted at a religious ceremony before we came away, at the
special request of our kind friend the captain. The fore-sail that
was set when she broached to was given as an offering to the
church, as the black priest told them it was through it they were
saved. Although the worst sailor in the world knew it was the sail
that would have sunk us, they dared not contradict the priest. The
whole ship's crew carried it through the streets of Lisbon upon
handkerchiefs to the church where it was placed upon the altar with
much mummery. We came away and left them but the owners of the
vessel bought back the sail again, after the priests had blessed it
to their minds, as the church had more use for money than
fore-sails.</p>

<p>William Mercer and I entered on board a brig bound for London,
which was to sail in a few days, during which time we rambled about
through the filthy streets of Lisbon. The higher orders of the
Portuguese are very kind and civil. I was too late one evening to
get on board the brig. A Portuguese merchant noticed my perplexity,
for it is no pleasing thing to have a lodging to seek in Lisbon at
a latish hour. Without my requesting him, he took me to his own
house, gave me an excellent supper and bed. Had I been a gentleman
of his acquaintance he could not have been kinder or paid me more
attention. He ordered his servant to call me at any hour in the
morning I chose.</p>

<p>As war was now looked for we were afraid for the press. The
Portuguese captain, at our request, got each of us a protection
from the British consul at Lisbon. With a joyful heart I set sail
for London to look out for an Indiaman that I might get to Bombay
and inquire for Sarah, for she was still the idol of all my
affections. At this time I was all anxiety to reach England. I
often hoped she had reached her father's house and there was pining
at my absence. I used for days to flatter myself with these
dreams.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Gravesend a man-of-war's boat came on board
to press any Englishmen there might be on board. William and I did
not choose to trust to our protections now that we were in the
river. So we stowed ourselves away among some bags of cotton where
we were almost smothered but could hear every word that was said.
The captain told the lieutenant he had no more hands than he saw,
and they were all Portuguese. The lieutenant was not very
particular, and left the brig without making much search. When the
boat left the vessel we crept from our hiding hole, and not long
after a custom-house officer came on board. When we cast anchor, as
I had a suit of long clothes in my chest that I had provided,
should I have been so fortunate as have found Sarah at Port
Jackson, to dash away with her a bit on shore, I put them on
immediately and gave the custom-house officer half a guinea for the
loan of his cocked hat and powdered wig. The long gilt-headed cane
was included in the bargain.</p>

<p>I got a waterman to put me on shore. I am confident my own
father, had he been alive, could not have known me with my cane in
my hand, cocked hat and bushy wig. I inquired at the waterman the
way to the inn where the coach set out from for London; I at the
same time knew as well as him. I passed for a passenger. At the inn
I called for a pint of wine, pens and ink, and was busy writing any
nonsense that came in my head until the coach set off. All these
precautions were necessary. Had the waterman suspected me to be a
sailor he would have informed the press-gang in one minute. The
waiters at the inn would have done the same.</p>

<p>By these precautions I arrived safe in London but did not go
down to Wapping until next day, where I took up my old lodgings,
still in my disguise. My landlord went on board and brought on
shore my bedding and chest. I left them under his charge while I
went to Lincoln to Sarah's parents where I made every
inquiry&mdash;but they knew not so much of her as I did myself. The
last information they had obtained was from the letter I had put in
the post office for them before I sailed in the <i>Amelia</i>. I
immediately returned to London where, to my disappointment, I found
there was not a berth to be got in any of the Indiamen who were for
Bombay direct. They were all full. I then, as my next best, went to
be engaged as cooper on board the <i>Nottingham</i> for China
direct, depending on providence if we were ever to meet again. To
find some way to effect my purpose, my landlord took me to be
impressed. He got the six guineas allowed the bringer, which he
returned to me. He was from Inverness, as honest a man as ever
lived. I had always boarded in his house when in London.</p>

<p>A curious scene happened at my entry. There were a few more
impressed on the same day, one an old tar. When asked by Captain
Rogers, in his examination, how they hauled the main tack aboard,
he replied, 'I can't tell, your honour, but I can show.' He clapped
his foot into Captain Rogers' pocket, at the same instant leaped on
his shoulders, tore his coat to the skirts, saying, 'Thus we haul
it aboard.'</p>

<p>Captain Barefoot of the <i>Nottingham</i> and the other captains
laughed heartily, as well as Rogers, who said rather peevishly,
'You might have shown, without tearing my coat.'</p>

<p>'How could I, your honour?' was the reply.</p>

Incident&mdash;Java&mdash;Wampoa&mdash;Chinese

Impressed&mdash;Leith Roads&mdash;Mutiny&mdash;Storm at Sea.</h2>

<p>I THUS AGAIN set off as cooper of the <i>Nottingham</i> in 1793.
Nothing worthy of notice happened. As I have gone over the same
voyage before I will not detain the reader, but one circumstance
that I witnessed off the Cape of Good Hope I cannot avoid
mentioning as a dreadful example of what man will dare, and the
perils he will encounter, to free himself from a situation he
dislikes. A man-of-war had been washing her gratings when the India
fleet hove in sight. (They are washed by being lowered overboard
and allowed to float astern.) Four or five men had slipped down
upon them, cut them adrift and were thus voluntarily committed to
the vast Atlantic without a bit of biscuit or a drop of water or
any means of guiding the gratings they were floating upon in the
hope of being picked up by some vessel. They held out their arms to
us and supplicated in the wildest manner to be taken on board.</p>

<p>The captain would not. The <i>Nottingham</i> was a fast sailing
ship and the first in the fleet. He said, 'I will not. Some of the
stern ships will pick them up.' While he spoke these unfortunate
and desponding fellow creatures lessened to our view, while their
cries rung in our ears. I hope some of the stern ships picked them
up. Few things I have seen are more strongly impressed upon my
memory than the despairing looks and frantic gestures of these
victims in quest of liberty. Next morning the frigate they had left
came alongside of us and inquired if we had seen them. The captain
gave an indirect answer to their inquiries, as well he might.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Java and anchored at Batavia I made every
inquiry for a country ship, and would have left the
<i>Nottingham</i> in a moment had there been one. All my money was
concealed upon my person for a start. I thought of falling sick and
remaining until a country ship came, but I might really have become
what I feigned in this European's grave, as I must have remained in
the hospital. Had I walked about the city in health, the Dutch
would soon have kidnapped me. I was thus once more baffled. Indeed,
I must confess, I did not feel the same anguish now I had endured
before. It was now four years since I had left her in the colony,
and her leaving it so soon, without waiting for me, showed she
cared less about me than I cared for her. Not to write to her
parents I had often thought very neglectful of her. I made up my
mind not to leave the <i>Nottingham</i> at such risks, but to
return in her to England and settle, as I had now some cash and had
seen all I could see, and just make one more call at her friends in
Lincoln, in my way to Scotland, and be ruled by the information I
there obtained.</p>

<p>We sailed for Wampoa, where I was kindly received by my Chinese
friends. I now paid more attention and saw things without the glare
of novelty and have no cause to alter anything I said before. I had
always, while at home, thought them the best tradesmen and most
ingenious of people. I am inclined to think they have been
overrated in regard to their abilities. Some things they do very
neat, but considering the things they have to do them with it is no
wonder. I mean their varnishes and colours, native productions.</p>

<p>Let the following facts that I can vouch for speak for
themselves. In my own line they are unable to make any article with
two ends, such as barrels. They have only reached the length of a
tub. These they dool, that is pin with bamboos, the joints of the
staves as well as the bottom. When a cask that comes from Europe is
to be broached they cannot even bore and place the crane on it. A
foreign cooper must go on shore and do it. Many a half dollar I
have got for this service myself from the Chinese merchants. I do
not believe they can make a nail with a head. Many thousand of
their nails I have had through my hands, and never saw one with a
head upon it such as we have in England. Their nails are either
sprigs or simply bent like a crow's toe. They are the worst smiths
of any people, and can do nothing with a bar of iron if thick. I
and the other coopers always kept the cuttings of our hoops which
they bought with avidity&mdash;but larger pieces they would scarce
take from us.</p>

<p>A vessel, the <i>Argyll</i>, while we were there in the <i>King
George</i>, had lost her rudder in the voyage out and could not
sail without a new one. There was not a smith in Canton who could
forge the ironwork. The captain of the ship applied to the armourer
of the <i>King George</i> who took it in hand and in three weeks
gained one hundred dollars by the job.</p>

<p>They appear to me to be excellent copiers, but not inventors.
One of our officers sat for a painter to draw his picture and told
the Chinese not to make him ugly. 'How can make other than is?' was
the reply. He had no idea of altering a single feature to add to
the looks of the object he was painting. All was a slavish copy of
what was before his eyes. If you want anything made out of the
common they must have one of the same as a pattern or they will not
take it in hand. And what is further proof of their want of
invention is, when you see one house you have seen every house of
the same rank, or any other articles of their manufacture you have
seen all. There is scarcely any variety and you need give yourself
no trouble looking for others if the price pleases.</p>

<p>There is no change of fashion: the oldest articles you can fall
in with are the same make and fashion as the newest, and a
traveller who visited the country two hundred years ago could know
no difference but in the men. They would be new, the old having
died; the present race, I may say, wearing their dress and
inhabiting their houses without the least change in the general
appearance.</p>

<p>The only instrument of music I saw was a bagpipe, like the small
Lowland pipe, on which they play well. Their gongs cannot be called
a musical instrument. When John Tuck, the deputy emperor, appears
(he is called so by the seamen on account of his having a gallows
on board the grand boat which is as large as a seventy-four-gun
ship and crowded with attendants), his band consists only of
bagpipes. Their gongs are only used that I heard to make <i>tchin,
tchin</i> to Joss in bad weather and at their paper sacrifices; and
every vessel, down to the smallest sampan, has a Joss on board.</p>

<p>The deputy emperor comes once every year to view the fleet and
pay his respects to the commodore. It is the grandest sight upon
the river. Not so much as a sampan is allowed to move. He makes a
present to every ship in the fleet of bullocks, wine, schamsee and
flour. The officers start the schamsee overboard&mdash;it is a
pernicious liquor distilled from rice. The flour is so coarse it is
given to the hogs. They measure every ship and can tell to a
quarter chest how much she will hold. The first American sloop that
came, she having only one mast, the Chinamen said, 'Hey, yaw, what
fashion? How can measure ship with one mast?'&mdash;they having
been accustomed to measure ships with more masts than one. They
measure between the masts the breadth and depth of the ship.</p>

<p>I went up the river to the Dutch Folly, a fort lying waste
opposite Canton in the middle of the river. The Dutch pretended
they wished to build an hospital for their sick and got leave to do
so, but their design was discovered by the bursting of a large
barrel full of shot, and the Chinese put a stop to their
undertaking, which now lies waste.</p>

<p>The Chinese sell all their fish, frogs, rats and hogs alive, and
all by weight. Their frogs are bred and fed by them and are the
largest I ever saw. When we bought our sea stock the hogs came on
board in the baskets in which they were weighed. The Chinese women
are seldom seen in the streets. They walk very ill, and their gowns
sweep the ground. Their hair is very prettily done up in the form
of a crown on the top of their heads and fastened with a large gold
or silver pin. The Tartar women are to be met at every step.</p>

<p>The cargo being complete, we fell down the river using our old
precaution to keep off the Chinese chop-officers, and they retired
with the same exclamation:</p>

<p>'Hey, yaw, what fashion? Too much baubry. Too much baubry.'</p>

<p>Nothing uncommon happened until we reached the Downs. I had
allowed my beard to grow long and myself to be very dirty to be as
unlikely as possible when the man-of-war boats came on board to
press the crew. As we expected, they came. I was in the hold,
sorting among the water casks, and escaped. They took every hand
that would answer. I rejoiced in my escape but my joy was of short
duration. One of the men they had taken had a sore leg. The boat
brought him back&mdash;and I had the bad luck to be taken and he
was left. Thus were all my schemes blown into the air. I found
myself in a situation I could not leave, a bondage that had been
imposed upon me against my will, and no hopes of relief until the
end of the war&mdash;not that I disliked it, but I had now become
weary of wandering for a time and longed to see Scotland again. My
heart always pointed to my native land. Remonstrance and complaint
were equally vain.</p>

<p>I therefore made up my mind to it, and was as happy as a man in
blasted prospects can be. I was taken on board the
<i>Venerable</i>, Admiral Duncan. She was the flagship and
commanded by Captain Hope, now Admiral Hope. The <i>Venerable</i>'s
boats had made a clean ship of the <i>Nottingham</i>. She was
forced to be brought up the river by ticket-porters and old
Greenwich men. Next morning sixty of us who had belonged to the
<i>Nottingham</i> were turned over to the <i>Edgar</i>,
seventy-four, Captain Sir Charles Henry Knowles. This was on the
11th June 1794. I was stationed in the gunner's crew.</p>

<p>We went upon a cruise to the coast of Norway, then touched at
Shetland for fresh provisions. Afterwards we sailed for Leith
Roads. I now felt all the inconveniencies of my confinement. I was
at home in sight of the place where I wished all my wanderings to
cease. Captain Barefoot of the <i>Nottingham</i> had wrote to Sir
C. H. Knowles in my behalf, and he was very kind to me. I asked
leave to go on shore to see my friends which he consented to, but
Lieutenant Collis would not allow me, saying 'it was not safe to
allow a pressed man to go on shore at his native place'. Had I been
allowed, I did not intend to leave the <i>Edgar</i>. I would not
have run away for any money, upon my kind captain's account. My
uncle came on board and saw me before we sailed, and I was visited
by my other friends, which made me quite happy.</p>

<p>While we lay in Leith Roads, a mutiny broke out in the
<i>Defiance</i>, seventy-four. The cause was, their captain gave
them five-water grog; now the common thing is three-waters. The
weather was cold. The spirit thus reduced was, as the mutineers
called it, as thin as muslin and quite unfit to keep out the cold.
No seaman could endure this in cold climates. Had they been in hot
latitudes they would have been happy to get it thus for the sake of
the water, but then they would not have got it.</p>

<p>The <i>Edgar</i> was ordered alongside the <i>Defiance</i> to
engage her, if necessary, to bring her to order. We were saved this
dreadful alternative by their returning to duty. She was manned
principally by fishermen, stout resolute dogs. When bearing down
upon her my heart felt so sad and heavy, not that I feared death or
wounds, but to fight my brother, as it were. I do not believe the
<i>Edgar</i>'s crew would have manned the guns. They thought the
<i>Defiance</i> men were in the right, and had they engaged us
heartily as we would have done a French seventy-four, we could have
done no good, only blown each other out of the water, for the ships
were of equal force; and if there were any odds the <i>Defiance</i>
had it in point of crew. Had I received my discharge and one
hundred guineas I could not have felt my heart lighter than I did
when we returned to our anchorage. And the gloom immediately
vanished from every face in the ship.</p>

<p>We shortly after sailed on a cruise in the north seas and
encountered a dreadful gale on the 17th October. I never was in
such danger in all my life. The <i>Edgar</i> was only newly put in
commission, and her rigging was new and not properly seasoned. We
in a few hours carried away our bowsprit and foremast in this
dreadful night, then our mizen and main topmast. With great
difficulty we cut them clear. Soon after our mainmast loosened in
the step, and we every moment expected it to go through her bottom.
Then no exertion could have saved us from destruction. The
carpenter, by good fortune, got it secured.</p>

<p>We lost all our anchors and cables in our attempts to bring her
to, save one. At length it moderated a little, when we rigged jury
masts and made for the Humber where we brought to with our only
remaining anchor&mdash;when the <i>Inflexible</i>, Captain Savage,
hove in sight and took us in tow. When in this situation the
coasters, as they passed, called to the <i>Inflexible</i>, 'What
prize have you got in tow?' A fresh gale sprung up and the
<i>Inflexible</i> was forced to cast us off.</p>

<p>The weather moderated again and we proceeded up the Swain the
best way we could into Blackstakes, Chatham. My berth during the
storm, as one of the gunner's crew, was in charge of the powder on
deck we used in firing our guns of distress. The ship rolled so
much we were often upon our beam ends, and rolled a number of our
guns overboard. We were forced to start all our beer and water to
lighten the ship, but we rode it out, contrary to our expectation,
and were shortly after turned over, captain and all, to the
<i>Goliah</i>, seventy-four guns, and sailed to join Sir John
Jervis in the blockade of Toulon. We boarded a Spanish ship and
found on board thirty Austrian prisoners. They every man entered
with us as marines.</p>

Aboukir Bay&mdash;Anecdotes of the Battle&mdash;Subsequent
Occurrences&mdash;Landing of the British Army in
Egypt&mdash;Ophthalmia&mdash;Return to England.</h2>

<p>WE NEXT SAILED for St Forensa Bay in the island of Corsica to
water, but found the French in possession of the watering-place,
and could get none. I belonged to the launch and had charge of the
powder and match. I was constantly on shore when any service was to
be done in destroying stores, spiking guns, blowing up batteries,
and enjoyed it much. We carried off all the brass guns, and those
metal ones that were near the edge of the rocks we threw into the
sea. This was excellent sport to us but we were forced to leave it
and sail to Gibraltar for water and provisions; but could obtain no
supplies and sailed for Lisbon where we got plenty, having been on
short allowance for some time before.</p>

<p>While we lay at Lisbon we got private intelligence overland that
the Spanish fleet was at sea. We with all dispatch set sail in
pursuit of them. We were so fortunate as come in sight of them by
break of day, on the 14th of February, off Cape St Vincent. They
consisted of twenty-five sail, mostly three-deckers. We were only
eighteen but we were English, and we gave them their valentines in
style. Soon as we came in sight, a bustle commenced not to be
conceived or described. To do it justice, while every man was as
busy as he could be the greater order prevailed. A serious cast was
to be perceived on every face but not a shade of doubt or fear. We
rejoiced in a general action; not that we loved fighting, but we
all wished to be free to return to our homes and follow our own
pursuits. We knew there was no other way of obtaining this than by
defeating the enemy. 'The hotter war the sooner peace,' was a
saying with us. When everything was cleared, the ports open, the
matches lighted and guns run out, then we gave them three such
cheers as are only to be heard in a British man-of-war. This
intimidates the enemy more than a broadside, as they have often
declared to me. It shows them all is right, and the men in the true
spirit baying to be at them.</p>

<p>During the action, my situation was not one of danger but most
wounding to my feelings and trying to my patience. I was stationed
in the after-magazine, serving powder from the screen, and could
see nothing&mdash;but I could feel every shot that struck the
<i>Goliah</i>, and the cries and groans of the wounded were most
distressing as there was only the thickness of the blankets of the
screen between me and them. Busy as I was, the time hung upon me
with a dreary weight. Not a soul spoke to me but the master-at-arms
as he went his rounds to inquire if all was safe. No sick person
ever longed more for his physician than I for the voice of the
master-at-arms. The surgeon's-mate at the commencement of the
action spoke a little, but his hands were soon too full of his own
affairs.</p>

<p>Those who were carrying run like wild creatures and scarce
opened their lips. I would far rather have been on the decks amid
the bustle, for there the time flew on eagle's wings. The
<i>Goliah</i> was sore beset; for some time she had two
three-deckers upon her. The men stood to their guns as cool as if
they had been exercising. The admiral ordered the <i>Britannia</i>
to our assistance. Iron-sides, with her forty-twos, soon made them
sheer off. Towards the close of the action the men were very weary.
One lad put his head out of the porthole, saying, 'Damn them, are
they not going to strike yet?' For us to strike was out of the
question.</p>

<p>At length the roar of the guns ceased and I came on deck to see
the effects of a great sea engagement&mdash;but such a scene of
blood and desolation I want words to express. I had been in a great
number of actions with single ships in the <i>Proteus</i> and
<i>Surprise</i> during the seven years I was in them. This was my
first action in a fleet and I had only a small share in it. We had
destroyed a great number and secured four three-deckers. One they
had the impiety to call the <i>Holy Ghost</i> we wished much to
get, but they towed her off. The fleet was in such a shattered
situation we lay twenty-four hours in sight of them, repairing our
rigging. It is after the action the disagreeable part commences.
The crews are wrought to the utmost of their strength. For days
they have no remission of their toil, repairing the rigging and
other parts injured in the action. Their spirits are broke by
fatigue. They have no leisure to talk of the battle and, when the
usual round of duty returns, we do not choose to revert to a
disagreeable subject. Who can speak of what he did where all did
their utmost? One of my mess-mates had the heel of his shoe shot
off. The skin was not broke yet his leg swelled and became black.
He was lame for a long time.</p>

<p>On our return to Lisbon we lost one of the fleet, the <i>Bombay
Castle</i>. She was stranded and completely lost. All her crew were
saved. We were in great danger in the <i>Goliah</i>. Captain Sir C.
H. Knowles was tried for not lending assistance, when he needed it
himself. The court-martial honourably acquitted him. Collis, our
first lieutenant, told us not to cheer when he came on board, but
we loved our captain too well to be restrained. We had agreed upon
a signal with the coxswain, if he was, as he ought to be,
honourably acquitted. The signal was given and in vain Collis
forbade. We manned the yards and gave three hearty cheers. Not a
man on board but would have bled for Sir C. H. Knowles. To our
regret we lost him to our ship at this very time. He was as good a
captain as I ever sailed with. He was made admiral, and went home
in the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Foley took command of the <i>Goliah</i> and we joined
the blockade of Cadiz where we remained, sending our boat to assist
at the bombardments and covering them, until Admiral Nelson came
out again and picked out thirteen seventy-fours from the fleet. The
<i>Goliah</i> was one. She was the fastest sailing ship in the
fleet. We did not stay to water but got a supply from the ships
that were to remain, and away we set under a press of sail, not
knowing where.</p>

<p>We came to an anchor in the Straits of Messina. There was an
American man-of-war at anchor. Captain Foley ordered him to unmoor
that the <i>Goliah</i> might get her station, as it was a good one
near the shore, but Jonathan would not budge, but made answer, 'I
will let you know I belong to the United States of America and I
will not give way to any nation under the sun but in a good
cause.'</p>

<p>So we came to an anchor where we could. We remained here but a
short time when we got intelligence that the French fleet were up
the Straits. We then made sail for Egypt but missed them, and came
back to Syracuse and watered in twenty-four hours. I was up all
night filling water. The day after we left Syracuse we fell in with
a French brig who had just left the fleet. Admiral Nelson took her
in tow and she conducted us to where they lay at anchor in Aboukir
Bay.</p>

<p>We had our anchors out at our stern port with a spring upon
them, and the cable carried along the ship's side, so that the
anchors were at our bows, as if there was no change in the
arrangement. This was to prevent the ships from swinging round, as
every ship was to be brought to by her stern. We ran in between the
French fleet and the shore to prevent any communication between the
enemy and the shore. Soon as they were in sight a signal was made
from the admiral's ship for every vessel as she came up to make the
best of her way, firing upon the French ships as she passed, and
'every man to take his bird' as we joking called it. The
<i>Goliah</i> led the van. There was a French frigate right in our
way. Captain Foley cried, 'Sink that brute, what does he there?' In
a moment she went to the bottom and her crew were seen running into
her rigging. The sun was just setting as we went into the bay, and
a red and fiery sun it was. I would, if had I had my choice, been
on the deck. There I would have seen what was passing and the time
would not have hung so heavy, but every man does his duty with
spirit, whether his station be in the slaughterhouse or the
magazine.</p>

<p>I saw as little of this action as I did of the one on the 14th
February off Cape St Vincent. My station was in the powder magazine
with the gunner. As we entered the bay we stripped to our trousers,
opened our ports, cleared, and every ship we passed gave them a
broadside and three cheers. Any information we got was from the
boys and women who carried the powder. The women behaved as well as
the men, and got a present for their bravery from the grand
signior. When the French admiral's ship blew up, the <i>Goliah</i>
got such a shake we thought the after-part of her had blown up
until the boys told us what it was. They brought us every now and
then the cheering news of another French ship having struck, and we
answered the cheers on deck with heartfelt joy. In the heat of the
action a shot came right into the magazine but did no harm as the
carpenters plugged it up and stopped the water that was rushing
in.</p>

<p>I was much indebted to the gunner's wife who gave her husband
and me a drink of wine every now and then, which lessened our
fatigue much. There were some of the women wounded, and one woman
belonging to Leith died of her wounds and was buried on a small
island in the bay. One woman bore a son in the heat of the action.
She belonged to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>When we ceased firing I went on deck to view the state of the
fleets, and an awful sight it was. The whole bay was covered with
dead bodies, mangled, wounded and scorched, not a bit of clothes on
them except their trousers. There were a number of French,
belonging to the French admiral's ship the <i>L'Orient</i>, who had
swam to the <i>Goliah</i> and were cowering under her forecastle.
Poor fellows, they were brought on board and Captain Foley ordered
them down to the steward's room to get provisions and clothing. One
thing I observed in these Frenchmen quite different from anything I
had ever before observed. In the American war, when we took a
French ship, the <i>Duke de Chartres</i>, the prisoners were as
merry as if they had taken us, only saying, '<i>Fortune de
guerre</i>'&mdash;you take me today, I take you tomorrow. Those we
now had on board were thankful for our kindness but were sullen and
as downcast as if each had lost a ship of his own.</p>

<p>The only incidents I heard of are two. One lad who was stationed
by a salt box on which he sat to give out cartridges and keep the
lid close&mdash;it is a trying berth&mdash;when asked for a
cartridge, he gave none, yet he sat upright. His eyes were open.
One of the men gave him a push. He fell all his length on the deck.
There was not a blemish on his body yet he was quite dead, and was
thrown overboard. The other, a lad who had the match in his hand to
fire his gun. In the act of applying it a shot took off his arm. It
hung by a small piece of skin. The match fell to the deck. He
looked to his arm and, seeing what had happened, seized the match
in his left hand and fired off the gun before he went to the
cockpit to have it dressed. They were in our mess or I might never
have heard of it. Two of the mess were killed and I knew not of it
until the day after. Thus terminated the glorious first of August,
the busiest night in my life.</p>

<p>Soon after the action the whole fleet set sail with the prizes,
and left the <i>Goliah</i> as guard ship. We remained here until we
were relieved by the <i>Tigre</i>, seventy-four, when we sailed for
Naples to refit. After refitting we sailed for Malta to join in the
blockade, where we remained eight months without any occurrence
worthy of notice. At length the <i>Goliah</i> became so leaky we
were forced to leave our station and sail for Gibraltar where,
after watering, we sailed for England.</p>

<p>We got some marines from the Rock to reinforce the
<i>Goliah</i>'s complement&mdash;one of them a tall stout
Englishman who had been cock of the Rock. He was very overbearing.
There are often quarrels at the ship's fires when the men are
boiling their kettles. We had a stout little fellow of an Irishman,
who had been long in the <i>Goliah</i>. The marine pushed his
kettle aside. Paddy demanded why he did so.</p>

<p>'Because I choose to do it.'</p>

<p>'I won't allow you while the life is in me,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Do you wish to fight?' said the Englishman.</p>

<p>'Yes, and I do,' said Paddy. 'I will take the Gibraltar rust out
of you or you shall beat the life out of my body before we are
done.'</p>

<p>A fight was made up in a minute, and they went well forward on
the deck to be out of sight of the officers. To it they went and
fought it out, we forming a ring and screening them from
observation. Paddy was as good as his word, for he took the rust
off the marine so well he was forced to give in, and we were all
happy to see the lobster-back's pride taken out of him.</p>

<p>On our arrival she was put out of commission, and the crew
turned over to the <i>Royal William</i>, the guard ship, and had
two or three days' liberty on shore by the admiral's order.</p>

<p>I was next drafted on board the <i>Ramilies</i> and sailed for
Belleisle, but remained only a short time in her when I was turned
over to the <i>Ajax</i>, Captain Alexander F. Cochrane, upon
preferment. We sailed for Ferrol and attempted to cut out some
vessels but did not succeed, then stood for Algiers to water,
having a fleet of transports with troops on board under convoy. The
troops were commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby. Having watered, we
sailed with the army to Mamarice Bay, and the troops were encamped
upon a fine piece of ground, with a rivulet running through the
centre. The French had just left the place, having first done all
the mischief in their power.</p>

<p>While we lay here an engineer named William Balcarras went in a
frigate to reconnoitre the French works. He landed and, having
attained his object, was coming off in his boat when he was
followed by another from the shore and shot dead before he reached
the frigate. We left Mamarice Bay and sailed to Rhodes, where we
took in forage for the cavalry. We then sailed for Alexandria and
landed the troops.</p>

<p>I belonged to one of the boats. Captain A. F. Cochrane was
beach-master, and had the ordering of the troops in the landing. We
began to leave the ships about twelve o'clock and reached the shore
about sunrise in the morning. We rowed very slow with our oars
muffled. It was a pleasant night. The water was very still and all
was as silent as death. No one spoke but each cast an anxious look
to the shore, then at each other, impatient to land. Each boat
carried about one hundred men and did not draw nine inches of
water.</p>

<p>The French cavalry were ready to receive us, but we soon forced
them back and landed eight thousand men the first morning. We had
good sport at landing the troops as the Frenchmen made a stout
resistance. We brought back the wounded men to the ships. For some
time we supplied the troops on shore with provisions and water.
After the advance of the troops into the country I was with the
seamen on shore, assisting at the siege of Alexandria and working
like a labourer in cutting off the branch of the Nile that supplied
the city with water. One of the <i>Ajax</i>'s boats, at Sir Ralph
Abercromby's request, carried him after receiving his wound, on
board the hospital ship.</p>

<p>Of all the countries I was ever in, in all my wanderings, I
could not remain in Egypt. The air is so dry and I felt so
disagreeable. It is, on the whole, sandy and barren, yet what I saw
of it that was cultivated is very agreeable. For some days before
the town surrendered I had been so bad with the flux I was forced
to go on board. After the town surrendered and the operations of
the army ceased we sailed for Malta. At this time I was blind with
the ophthalmia and continued thus for six weeks.</p>

<p>My sufferings were most acute. I could not lie down for a
moment, for the scalding water that continually flowed from my eyes
filled them and put me to exquisite torture. I sat constantly on my
chest with a vessel of cold water bathing them. If I slept I awoke
in an agony of pain. All the time the flux was most severe upon me
and the surgeon would not dry it up, as it, he said, relieved my
eyes. When we came to Malta a French surgeon cured me by touching
the balls of my eyes with tincture of opium, but the pain of the
application was very severe. Thank God, however, I soon after
recovered my health and spirits. From Malta we sailed to Gibraltar
where we watered, then sailed for England where, to my joy, I found
that peace was concluded. We were all paid off shortly after our
arrival. I was ship's corporal when I was discharged.</p>

<p>I WAS ONCE more my own master, and felt so happy I was like one
bewildered. Did those on shore only experience half the sensations
of a sailor at perfect liberty after being seven years on board
ship without a will of his own, they would not blame his
eccentricities but wonder he was not more foolish. After a few days
my cooler reason began to resume its power and I began to think
what should be my after pursuits. It was now seven years since I
had been pressed from the <i>Nottingham</i>. In that time the
thoughts of Sarah had faded into a distant pleasing dream. The
violent desire I at one time felt to repossess her was now softened
into a curiosity to know what had become of her.</p>

<p>As I was now possessed of a good deal of pay and prize-money
due, when I received it I went down by Lincoln to make inquiry, but
no one had heard of her since I was there myself, nine years
before. So all my inquiries after her terminated and I proceeded to
Scotland, determined to settle, as I was now too old to undertake
any more love pilgrimages after an individual, as I knew not in
what quarter of the globe she was or whether she was dead or
alive.</p>

<p>I arrived in Edinburgh just twenty-five years after I had left
it to wander over the globe. I had been only twice there, once at
the end of the American war when I found my father dead and my
brothers wanderers. After my return from the voyage with Captain
Portlock I remained only a few days and just passed through the
city. When in the <i>Edgar</i>, I never had been on shore. I scarce
knew a face in Edinburgh. It had doubled itself in my absence. I
now wandered in elegant streets where I had left corn growing.
Everything was new to me. I confess I felt more sincere pleasure
and enjoyment in beholding the beauties of Edinburgh than ever I
felt in any foreign clime, for I now could identify myself with
them. I was a Scotchman and I felt as if they were my own property.
In China, in Naples, in Rio de Janeiro or even in London I felt as
a stranger, and I beheld with only the eye of curiosity. Here I now
looked on with the eye of a son who is witnessing the improvements
of his father's house. Little did I at this time think I should
wander in these very streets to pick up a few coals to warm my aged
limbs! But everything is wisely ordered by that Power who has
protected me in dangers when I thought not of Him.</p>

<p>I felt myself, for a few weeks after my arrival, not so very
happy. As I had anticipated, there was scarcely a friend I had left
that I knew again. The old were dead, the young had grown up to
manhood and many were in foreign climes. The Firth of Forth which
in my youth appeared a sea to my inexperienced mind, Arthur Seat
and the neighbouring hills, now seemed dwindled to insignificance
in comparison to what I had witnessed in foreign parts. Because
they were my native scenery I felt hurt that any other country
should possess more imposing objects of their kind. But they were
Scotch and I loved them still.</p>

<p>I could not settle to work but wandered up and down. At length I
fell in with a cousin of my own. We had been playfellows and a
friendly intimacy had continued until I went to sea. I fixed my
affections on her and we were married. I gave her my solemn promise
never again to go to sea during her life. I then thought sincerely
of settling and following my trade. I bought a house in the Castle
Hill and furnished it well, then laid in a stock of wood and tools.
I had as much work as I could do for a soap work at the
Queensferry. For one year my prospects were as good as I could have
wished, and I was as happy as ever I had been in my life. But in a
few months after the war broke out again and the press-gang came in
quest of me. I could no longer remain in Edinburgh and avoid them.
My wife was like a distracted woman and gave me no rest until I
sold off my stock in trade and the greater part of my furniture and
retired to the country. Even until I got this accomplished I dared
not to sleep in my own house, as I had more than one call from the
gang.</p>

<p>I went to Cousland, nine miles from Edinburgh in the parish of
Cranstoun, and put up at one Robert Moodie's, a small public house,
not knowing what was to be my next pursuit. I could obtain no
employment as a cooper unless I lived in a large or seaport town,
and there I could not remain. I at length applied to Mr Dickson and
got work from him at the lime quarries. My berth was to bore and
charge the stones with gunpowder to facilitate the work. I
continued to live at Robert Moodie's, my wife Margaret paying me an
occasional visit, until I got a house of my own from Mr Dickson,
when she came out to reside constantly with me. I hoped that every
month would put a period to the war and I would be allowed to
return to Edinburgh. But peace still seemed to recede from Britain.
Year after year I looked for it in vain. When the weather was good,
night after night have I sat after my day's labour by the old
windmill in Bartholomew's field, first gazing upon Edinburgh that I
dared not reside in, then upon the vessels that glided along the
Forth. A sigh would escape me at my present lot. My promise to
Margaret kept me from them (my word has ever been my bond) or I
should assuredly have gone to sea again. I was like a bird in a
cage, with objects that I desired on every side but could not
obtain.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the small garden attached to my cottage
occupied my mind for some time. I was becoming a little more
reconciled to my lot when the press-gang came out even to Cousland
and took away a neighbour of the name of Murray. He had a large
family and, through the interest of the minister and neighbouring
gentlemen, he got off. His impressment was a great blow to my
tranquillity for many months. For a long time I slept every night
either in Dalkeith or Musselburgh, and during the day a stranger
could not appear near the quarry without causing the most
disagreeable sensations to me. At length this cause of uneasiness
wore off likewise, and I settled down to my usual calm expectations
of peace&mdash;but year followed year and my prospects were
unaltered.</p>

<p>I now began to see the great alterations that had taken place in
the country from the time I had been in it, when a boy, about the
year 1766. At that time I had resided for some time with my uncle
at Edmonstone. The country was very little inclosed. The farmers
lived with their servants. Now the country was inclosed and the
farmers were gentlemen. At Dalkeith fair, when the crops were off
the ground, it was called 'long halter time'. The cattle during the
fair got leave to stray at large while the farmers, their wives,
daughters and servants were all at the fair, only one woman being
left at home. Now the farmers, if they went to the fair, it was to
sell or buy, not to make merry. Their wives and daughters would
have thought themselves disgraced if they were seen at the fair.
They no longer messed with their servants but lived like noblemen
by themselves. If a servant had occasion to speak to his master, he
must address him as if he had been an admiral&mdash;this to me
appeared strange at first.</p>

<p>As Mr Dickson knew I was anxious for the news, he was so kind as
give me a reading of the newspapers when he was done. The other
workmen assembled in my cottage on the evenings I got them and I
read aloud. Then we would discuss the important parts together. The
others were not friendly to the government, save one, an old
soldier who had been in the East Indies. He and I always sided
together. I had broke His Majesty's bread for fourteen years and
would not, upon that account, hear his government spoken against. I
had but poor help from the old soldier and I had them all to
contend with, but when I was like to be run down I bothered them
with latitudes and longitudes and the old soldier swore to all I
said and we contrived to keep our ground, for we had both been
great travellers. When they spoke of heavy taxes I talked of China.
When they complained of hard times I told them of West Indian
slaves&mdash;but neither could make any impression on the
other.</p>

<p>When Murray was pressed and I was forced to skulk like a thief,
they thought they had a great triumph over me and did not spare
their taunts. One would ask what I thought of British freedom;
another if I could defend a government which did such things? I was
at no loss for my answer. I told them, 'Necessity had no law.'
Could the government make perfect seamen as easily as they could
soldiers there would be no such thing as pressing of seamen, and
that I was happy to be of more value than them all put together,
for they would not impress any of them, they were of so little
value compared with me.</p>

<p>When the news of the victory of Trafalgar arrived I had my
triumph over them in return. None but an old tar can feel the joy I
felt. I wrought none the next day but walked about enjoying the
feeling of triumph. Every now and then I felt the greatest desire
to hurra aloud, and many an hurra my heart gave that my mouth
uttered not.</p>

<p>For eleven years I lived at Cousland. Year followed year, but
still no views of peace. I grew old apace and the work became too
heavy for me. I was now fifty-eight years of age, and they would
not have taken me had I wished to enter the service. I therefore
removed to Edinburgh, and again began to work for myself. My first
employers had failed in business long before. The times were
completely changed. I could not get constant employment for myself.
I therefore wrought for any of the other masters who were throng,
but the cooper business is so very poor I have been oftener out of
employment than at work. Few of them keep journeymen. They, like
myself, do all their work with their own hands.</p>

<p>I never had any children by my cousin during the seventeen years
we lived together. Margaret during all that time never gave me a
bad word or made any strife by her temper&mdash;but all have their
faults. I will not complain, but more money going out than I by my
industry could bring in has now reduced me to want in my old
age.</p>

<p>At her death, which happened four years ago, I was forced to
sell all my property except a small room in which I live, and a
cellar where I do any little work I am so fortunate as obtain. This
I did to pay the expenses of her funeral and a number of debts that
had been contracted unknown to me. As my poverty will not allow me
to pay for a seat in a church, I go in the evenings to the Little
Church, but my house is in the Tolbooth parish.</p>

<p>Doctor Davidson visits me in his ministerial capacity. These, I
may say, are the only glimpses of sunshine that ever visit my
humble dwelling. Mr Mackenzie, my elder, is very attentive in
giving me tickets of admission to the sermons that are preached in
the school house in the Castle Hill. In one of Doctor Davidson's
visits, he made me a present of a few shillings. It was a great
gift from God. I had not one penny at the time in the house.</p>

<p>In the month of August, last year, a cousin of my own made me a
present of as much money as carried me to London. I sailed in the
<i>Hawk</i>, London smack. I was only a steerage passenger but
fared as well as the cabin passengers. I was held constantly in tow
by the passengers. My spirits were up. I was at sea again. I had
not trode a deck for twenty years before. I had always a crowd
round me listening to my accounts of the former voyages that I had
made. Everyone was more kind to me than another. I was very
happy.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival in London I waited upon my old captain,
Portlock, but fortune was now completely against me. He had been
dead six weeks before my arrival. I left the house, my spirits sunk
with grief for his death and my own disappointment, as my chief
dependence was upon his aid. I then went to Somerset House for the
certificate of my service: seven years in the <i>Proteus</i> and
<i>Surprise</i> in the American War, and seven in the <i>Edgar</i>,
<i>Goliah</i>, <i>Ramilies</i> and <i>Ajax</i> in the French War. I
was ordered to go to the Admiralty Office first and then come back
to Somerset House. When I applied at the Admiralty Office a clerk
told me I had been too long of applying. I then went down to the
Governor of Greenwich Hospital. I was not acquainted with him, but
I knew the Governor of Greenwich would be a distressed seaman's
friend. His servant told me he was in Scotland. I then waited upon
Captain Gore whose son's life I had saved, but he was not at home.
It was of no use to remain in London as my money wore down apace. I
took my passage back to Edinburgh in the <i>Favourite</i>, London
smack, and arrived just four weeks from my first setting out on
this voyage of disappointment. What can I do? I must just take what
fortune has still in store for me.</p>

<p>At one time, after I came home, I little thought I should ever
require to apply for a pension, and therefore made no application
until I really stood in need of it.</p>

<p>I eke out my subsistence in the best manner I can. Coffee made
from the raspings of bread (which I obtain from the bakers) twice a
day is my chief diet. A few potatoes or anything I can obtain with
a few pence constitute my dinner. My only luxury is tobacco which I
have used these forty-five years. To beg I never will submit. Could
I have obtained a small pension for my past services, I should then
have reached my utmost earthly wish and the approach of utter
helplessness would not haunt me as it at present does in my
solitary home. Should I be forced to sell it, all I would obtain
could not keep me and pay for lodgings for one year. Then I must go
to the poor's house, which God in his mercy forbid. I can look to
my death bed with resignation but to the poor's house I cannot look
with composure.</p>

<p>I have been a wanderer and the child of chance all my days, and
now only look for the time when I shall enter my last ship, and be
anchored with a green turf upon my breast, and I care not how soon
the command is given.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>Postscript by the Editor</h2>

<p>EARLY IN THE spring of the year 1822 John Nicol, the narrator of
these adventures, was pointed out to me as a most interesting
character, and one who had seen more of the world than most persons
in Edinburgh, perhaps in Britain. He was walking feebly along with
an old apron tied round his waist, in which he carried a few very
small pieces of coal he had picked up in his wanderings through the
streets. From the history I had got of his adventures, I felt
grieved to see the poor old man. I requested him to call at my
shop. He came in the evening. After a little conversation with him
I was astonished at the information he possessed, and the spirit
that awoke in the old tar.</p>

<p>I had no interest by which to serve myself. Money I had not to
give. As the only means of being of permanent use to him, and
perhaps of obtaining the pension he is by service entitled to, I
thought of taking down a narrative of his life, from his own mouth.
This I have done, as nearly as I could, in his own words. Even in
the midst of all his present wants, he is a contented cheerful old
man of sober habits, and bears an excellent character from those
people who have employed him in his trade as a cooper. I have con-
versed with one of his shipmates who was with him in the
<i>Edgar</i>, <i>Goliah</i> and <i>Ramilies</i>, who informs me he
was as sober and steady a man as ever sailed.</p>

<p>I have never met with one possessed of a more tenacious memory
or who gave a more distinct account of any occurrence he had
witnessed, of which any gentleman may satisfy himself, as John will
wait upon him with pleasure, upon application to the Publisher.</p>
