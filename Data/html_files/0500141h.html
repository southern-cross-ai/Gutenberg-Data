  <h2><a name="Prologue"
     id="prol">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Cigars had burned low, and we were beginning to sample the
  disillusionment that usually afflicts old school friends who have met again
  as men and found themselves with less in common than they had believed they
  had. Rutherford wrote novels; Wyland was one of the Embassy secretaries; he
  had just given us dinner at Tempelhof&mdash;not very cheerfully, I fancied,
  but with the equanimity which a diplomat must always keep on tap for such
  occasions. It seemed likely that nothing but the fact of being three celibate
  Englishmen in a foreign capital could have brought us together, and I had
  already reached the conclusion that the slight touch of priggishness which I
  remembered in Wyland Tertius had not diminished with years and an M.V.O.
  Rutherford I liked more; he had ripened well out of the skinny, precocious
  infant whom I had once alternately bullied and patronized. The probability
  that he was making much more money and having a more interesting life than
  either of us gave Wyland and me our one mutual emotion&mdash;a touch of
  envy.</p>

  <p>The evening, however, was far from dull. We had a good view of the big
  Lufthansa machines as they arrived at the aerodrome from all parts of Central
  Europe, and towards dusk, when arc flares were lighted, the scene took on a
  rich, theatrical brilliance. One of the planes was English, and its pilot, in
  full flying kit, strolled past our table and saluted Wyland, who did not at
  first recognize him. When he did so there were introductions all around, and
  the stranger was invited to join us. He was a pleasant, jolly youth named
  Sanders. Wyland made some apologetic remark about the difficulty of
  identifying people when they were all dressed up in Sibleys and flying
  helmets; at which Sanders laughed and answered: "Oh, rather, I know that well
  enough. Don't forget I was at Baskul." Wyland laughed also, but less
  spontaneously, and the conversation then took other directions.</p>

  <p>Sanders made an attractive addition to our small company, and we all drank
  a great deal of beer together. About ten o'clock Wyland left us for a moment
  to speak to someone at a table nearby, and Rutherford, into the sudden hiatus
  of talk, remarked: "Oh, by the way, you mentioned Baskul just now. I know the
  place slightly. What was it you were referring to that happened there?"</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled rather shyly. "Oh, just a bit of excitement we had once
  when I was in the Service." But he was a youth who could not long refrain
  from being confidential. "Fact is, an Afghan or an Afridi or somebody ran off
  with one of our buses, and there was the very devil to pay afterwards, as you
  can imagine. Most impudent thing I ever heard of. The blighter waylaid the
  pilot, knocked him out, pinched his kit, and climbed into the cockpit without
  a soul spotting him. Gave the mechanics the proper signals, too, and was up
  and away in fine style. The trouble was, he never came back."</p>

  <p>Rutherford looked interested. "When did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;must have been about a year ago. May, 'thirty-one. We were
  evacuating civilians from Baskul to Peshawar owing to the
  revolution&mdash;perhaps you remember the business. The place was in a bit of
  an upset, or I don't suppose the thing could have happened. Still, it DID
  happen&mdash;and it goes some way to show that clothes make the man, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Rutherford was still interested. "I should have thought you'd have had
  more than one fellow in charge of a plane on an occasion like that?"</p>

  <p>"We did, on all the ordinary troop carriers, but this machine was a
  special one, built for some maharajah originally&mdash;quite a stunt kind of
  outfit. The Indian Survey people had been using it for high-altitude flights
  in Kashmir."</p>

  <p>"And you say it never reached Peshawar?"</p>

  <p>"Never reached there, and never came down anywhere else, so far as we
  could discover. That was the queer part about it. Of course, if the fellow
  was a tribesman he might have made for the hills, thinking to hold the
  passengers for ransom. I suppose they all got killed, somehow. There are
  heaps of places on the frontier where you might crash and not be heard of
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know the sort of country. How many passengers were there?"</p>

  <p>"Four, I think. Three men and some woman missionary."</p>

  <p>"Was one of the men, by any chance, named Conway?"</p>

  <p>Sanders looked surprised. "Why, yes, as a matter of fact. 'Glory' Conway
  &mdash;did you know him?"</p>

  <p>"He and I were at the same school," said Rutherford a little
  self-consciously, for it was true enough, yet a remark which he was aware did
  not suit him.</p>

  <p>"He was a jolly fine chap, by all accounts of what he did at Baskul," went
  on Sanders.</p>

  <p>Rutherford nodded. "Yes, undoubtedly... but how extraordinary...
  extraordinary..." He appeared to collect himself after a spell of
  mind-wandering. Then he said: "It was never in the papers, or I think I
  should have read about it. How was that?"</p>

  <p>Sanders looked suddenly rather uncomfortable, and even, I imagined, was on
  the point of blushing. "To tell you the truth," he replied, "I seem to have
  let out more than I should have. Or perhaps it doesn't matter now&mdash;it
  must be stale news in every mess, let alone in the bazaars. It was hushed up,
  you see&mdash;I mean, about the way the thing happened. Wouldn't have sounded
  well. The government people merely gave out that one of their machines was
  missing, and mentioned the names. Sort of thing that didn't attract an awful
  lot of attention among outsiders."</p>

  <p>At this point Wyland rejoined us, and Sanders turned to him
  half-apologetically. "I say, Wyland, these chaps have been talking about
  'Glory' Conway. I'm afraid I spilled the Baskul yarn&mdash;I hope you don't
  think it matters?"</p>

  <p>Wyland was severely silent for a moment. It was plain that he was
  reconciling the claims of compatriot courtesy and official rectitude. "I
  can't help feeling," he said at length, "that it's a pity to make a mere
  anecdote of it. I always thought you air fellows were put on your honor not
  to tell tales out of school." Having thus snubbed the youth, he turned,
  rather more graciously, to Rutherford. "Of course, it's all right in your
  case, but I'm sure you realize that it's sometimes necessary for events up on
  the frontier to be shrouded in a little mystery."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," replied Rutherford dryly, "one has a curious itch to
  know the truth."</p>

  <p>"It was never concealed from anyone who had any real reason for wanting to
  know it. I was at Peshawar at the time, and I can assure you of that. Did you
  know Conway well&mdash;since school days, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little at Oxford, and a few chance meetings since. Did YOU come
  across him much?"</p>

  <p>"At Angora, when I was stationed there, we met once or twice."</p>

  <p>"Did you like him?"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was clever, but rather slack."</p>

  <p>Rutherford smiled. "He was certainly clever. He had a most exciting
  university career&mdash;until war broke out. Rowing Blue and a leading light
  at the Union and prizeman for this, that, and the other&mdash;also I reckon
  him the best amateur pianist I ever heard. Amazingly many-sided fellow, the
  kind, one feels, that Jowett would have tipped for a future premier. Yet, in
  point of fact, one never heard much about him after those Oxford days. Of
  course the war cut into his career. He was very young and I gather he went
  through most of it."</p>

  <p>"He was blown up or something," responded Wyland, "but nothing very
  serious. Didn't do at all badly, got a D.S.O. in France. Then I believe he
  went back to Oxford for a spell as a sort of don. I know he went east in
  'twenty-one. His Oriental languages got him the job without any of the usual
  preliminaries. He had several posts."</p>

  <p>Rutherford smiled more broadly. "Then of course, that accounts for
  everything. History will never disclose the amount of sheer brilliance wasted
  in the routine decoding F.O. chits and handing round tea at legation bun
  fights."</p>

  <p>"He was in the Consular Service, not the Diplomatic," said Wyland loftily.
  It was evident that he did not care for the chaff, and he made no protest
  when, after a little more badinage of a similar kind, Rutherford rose to go.
  In any case it was getting late, and I said I would go, too. Wyland's
  attitude as we made our farewells was still one of official propriety
  suffering in silence, but Sanders was very cordial and he said he hoped to
  meet us again sometime.</p>

  <p>I was catching a transcontinental train at a very dismal hour of the early
  morning, and, as we waited for a taxi, Rutherford asked me if I would care to
  spend the interval at his hotel. He had a sitting room, he said, and we could
  talk. I said it would suit me excellently, and he answered: "Good. We can
  talk about Conway, if you like, unless you're completely bored with his
  affairs."</p>

  <p>I said that I wasn't at all, though I had scarcely known him. "He left at
  the end of my first term, and I never met him afterwards. But he was
  extraordinarily kind to me on one occasion. I was a new boy and there was no
  earthly reason why he should have done what he did. It was only a trivial
  thing, but I've always remembered it."</p>

  <p>Rutherford assented. "Yes, I liked him a good deal too, though I also saw
  surprisingly little of him, if you measure it in time."</p>

  <p>And then there was a somewhat odd silence, during which it was evident
  that we were both thinking of someone who had mattered to us far more than
  might have been judged from such casual contacts. I have often found since
  then that others who met Conway, even quite formally and for a moment,
  remembered him afterwards with great vividness. He was certainly remarkable
  as a youth, and to me, who had known him at the hero-worshipping age, his
  memory is still quite romantically distinct. He was tall and extremely
  good-looking, and not only excelled at games but walked off with every
  conceivable kind of school prize. A rather sentimental headmaster once
  referred to his exploits as "glorious," and from that arose his nickname.
  Perhaps only he could have survived it. He gave a Speech Day oration in
  Greek, I recollect, and was outstandingly first-rate in school theatricals.
  There was something rather Elizabethan about him&mdash;his casual
  versatility, his good looks, that effervescent combination of mental with
  physical activities. Something a bit Philip-Sidney-ish. Our civilization
  doesn't often breed people like that nowadays. I made a remark of this kind
  to Rutherford, and he replied: "Yes, that's true, and we have a special word
  of disparagement for them&mdash;we call them dilettanti. I suppose some
  people must have called Conway that, people like Wyland, for instance. I
  don't much care for Wyland. I can't stand his type&mdash;all that primness
  and mountainous self-importance. And the complete head-prefectorial mind, did
  you notice it? Little phrases about 'putting people on their honor' and
  'telling tales out of school'&mdash;as though the bally Empire were the fifth
  form at St. Dominic's! But, then, I always fall foul of these sahib
  diplomats."</p>

  <p>We drove a few blocks in silence, and then he continued: "Still, I
  wouldn't have missed this evening. It was a peculiar experience for me,
  hearing Sanders tell that story about the affair at Baskul. You see, I'd
  heard it before, and hadn't properly believed it. It was part of a much more
  fantastic story, which I saw no reason to believe at all, or well, only one
  very slight reason, anyway. NOW there are TWO very slight reasons. I daresay
  you can guess that I'm not a particularly gullible person. I've spent a good
  deal of my life traveling about, and I know there are queer things in the
  world&mdash;if you see them yourself, that is, but not so often if you hear
  of them secondhand. And yet..."</p>

  <p>He seemed suddenly to realize that what he was saying could not mean very
  much to me, and broke off with a laugh. "Well, there's one thing certain
  &mdash;I'm not likely to take Wyland into my confidence. It would be like
  trying to sell an epic poem to Tit-Bits. I'd rather try my luck with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you flatter me," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Your book doesn't lead me to think so."</p>

  <p>I had not mentioned my authorship of that rather technical work (after
  all, a neurologist's is not everybody's "shop"), and I was agreeably
  surprised that Rutherford had even heard of it. I said as much, and he
  answered: "Well, you see, I was interested, because amnesia was Conway's
  trouble at one time."</p>

  <p>We had reached the hotel and he had to get his key at the bureau. As we
  went up to the fifth floor he said: "All this is mere beating about the bush.
  The fact is, Conway isn't dead. At least he wasn't a few months ago."</p>

  <p>This seemed beyond comment in the narrow space and time of an elevator
  ascent. In the corridor a few seconds later I responded: "Are you sure of
  that? How do you know?"</p>

  <p>And he answered, unlocking his door: "Because I traveled with him from
  Shanghai to Honolulu in a Jap liner last November." He did not speak again
  till we were settled in armchairs and had fixed ourselves with drinks and
  cigars. "You see, I was in China in the autumn on a holiday. I'm always
  wandering about. I hadn't seen Conway for years. We never corresponded, and I
  can't say he was often in my thoughts, though his was one of the few faces
  that have always come to me quite effortlessly if I tried to picture it. I
  had been visiting a friend in Hankow and was returning by the Pekin express.
  On the train I chanced to get into conversation with a very charming Mother
  Superior of some French sisters of charity. She was traveling to Chung-Kiang,
  where her convent was, and, because I knew a little French, she seemed to
  enjoy chattering to me about her work and affairs in general. As a matter of
  fact, I haven't much sympathy with ordinary missionary enterprise, but I'm
  prepared to admit, as many people are nowadays, that the Romans stand in a
  class by themselves, since at least they work hard and don't pose as
  commissioned officers in a world full of other ranks. Still, that's by the
  by. The point is that this lady, talking to me about the mission hospital at
  Chung-Kiang, mentioned a fever case that had been brought in some weeks back,
  a man who they thought must be a European, though he could give no account of
  himself and had no papers. His clothes were native, and of the poorest kind,
  and when taken in by the nuns he had been very ill indeed. He spoke fluent
  Chinese, as well as pretty good French, and my train companion assured me
  that before he realized the nationality of the nuns, he had also addressed
  them in English with a refined accent. I said I couldn't imagine such a
  phenomenon, and chaffed her gently about being able to detect a refined
  accent in a language she didn't know. We joked about these and other matters,
  and it ended by her inviting me to visit the mission if ever I happened to be
  thereabouts. This, of course, seemed then as unlikely as that I should climb
  Everest, and when the train reached Chung-Kiang I shook hands with genuine
  regret that our chance contact had come to an end. As it happened, though, I
  was back in Chung-Kiang within a few hours. The train broke down a mile or
  two further on, and with much difficulty pushed us back to the station, where
  we learned that a relief engine could not possibly arrive for twelve hours.
  That's the sort of thing that often happens on Chinese railways. So there was
  half a day to be lived through in Chung-Kiang&mdash;which made me decide to
  take the good lady at her word and call at the mission.</p>

  <p>"I did so, and received a cordial, though naturally a somewhat astonished,
  welcome. I suppose one of the hardest things for a non-Catholic to realize is
  how easily a Catholic can combine official rigidity with non-official
  broad-mindedness. Is that too complicated? Anyhow, never mind, those mission
  people made quite delightful company. Before I'd been there an hour I found
  that a meal had been prepared, and a young Chinese Christian doctor sat down
  with me to it and kept up a conversation in a jolly mixture of French and
  English. Afterwards, he and the Mother Superior took me to see the hospital,
  of which they were very proud. I had told them I was a writer, and they were
  simpleminded enough to be aflutter at the thought that I might put them all
  into a book. We walked past the beds while the doctor explained the cases.
  The place was spotlessly clean and looked to be very competently run. I had
  forgotten all about the mysterious patient with the refined English accent
  till the Mother Superior reminded me that we were just coming to him. All I
  could see was the back of the man's head; he was apparently asleep. It was
  suggested that I should address him in English, so I said 'Good afternoon,'
  which was the first and not very original thing I could think of. The man
  looked up suddenly and said 'Good afternoon' in answer. It was true; his
  accent was educated. But I hadn't time to be surprised at that, for I had
  already recognized him, despite his beard and altogether changed appearance
  and the fact that we hadn't met for so long. He was Conway. I was certain he
  was, and yet, if I'd paused to think about it, I might well have come to the
  conclusion that he couldn't possibly be. Fortunately I acted on the impulse
  of the moment. I called out his name and my own, and though he looked at me
  without any definite sign of recognition, I was positive I hadn't made any
  mistake. There was an odd little twitching of the facial muscles that I had
  noticed in him before, and he had the same eyes that at Balliol we used to
  say were so much more of a Cambridge blue than an Oxford. But besides all
  that, he was a man one simply didn't make mistakes about&mdash;to see him
  once was to know him always. Of course the doctor and the Mother Superior
  were greatly excited. I told them that I knew the man, that he was English,
  and a friend of mine, and that if he didn't recognize me, it could only be
  because he had completely lost his memory. They agreed, in a rather amazed
  way, and we had a long consultation about the case. They weren't able to make
  any suggestions as to how Conway could possibly have arrived at Chung-Kiang
  in his condition.</p>

  <p>"To make the story brief, I stayed there over a fortnight, hoping that
  somehow or other I might induce him to remember things. I didn't succeed, but
  he regained his physical health, and we talked a good deal. When I told him
  quite frankly who I was and who he was, he was docile enough not to argue
  about it. He was quite cheerful, even, in a vague sort of way, and seemed
  glad enough to have my company. To my suggestion that I should take him home,
  he simply said that he didn't mind. It was a little unnerving, that apparent
  lack of any personal desire. As soon as I could I arranged for our departure.
  I made a confidant of an acquaintance in the consular office at Hankow, and
  thus the necessary passport and so on were made out without the fuss there
  might otherwise have been. Indeed, it seemed to me that for Conway's sake the
  whole business had better be kept free from publicity and newspaper
  headlines, and I'm glad to say I succeeded in that. It could have been jam,
  of course, for the press.</p>

  <p>"Well, we made our exit from China in quite a normal way. We sailed down
  the Yangtze to Nanking, and then took a train for Shanghai. There was a Jap
  liner leaving for 'Frisco that same night, so we made a great rush and got on
  board."</p>

  <p>"You did a tremendous lot for him," I said.</p>

  <p>Rutherford did not deny it. "I don't think I should have done quite as
  much for anyone else," he answered. "But there was something about the
  fellow, and always had been&mdash;it's hard to explain, but it made one enjoy
  doing what one could."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "He had a peculiar charm, a sort of winsomeness that's
  pleasant to remember even now when I picture it, though, of course, I think
  of him still as a schoolboy in cricket flannels."</p>

  <p>"A pity you didn't know him at Oxford. He was just brilliant&mdash;there's
  no other word. After the war people said he was different. I, myself, think
  he was. But I can't help feeling that with all his gifts he ought to have
  been doing bigger work. All that Britannic Majesty stuff isn't my idea of a
  great man's career. And Conway was&mdash;or should have been&mdash;GREAT. You
  and I have both known him, and I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it's
  an experience we shan't ever forget. And even when he and I met in the middle
  of China, with his mind a blank and his past a mystery, there was still that
  queer core of attractiveness in him."</p>

  <p>Rutherford paused reminiscently and then continued: "As you can imagine,
  we renewed our old friendship on the ship. I told him as much as I knew about
  himself, and he listened with an attention that might almost have seemed a
  little absurd. He remembered everything quite clearly since his arrival at
  Chung-Kiang, and another point that may interest you is that he hadn't
  forgotten languages. He told me, for instance, that he knew he must have had
  something to do with India, because he could speak Hindostani.</p>

  <p>"At Yokohama the ship filled up, and among the new passengers was
  Sieveking, the pianist, en route for a concert tour in the States. He was at
  our dining table and sometimes talked with Conway in German. That will show
  you how outwardly normal Conway was. Apart from his loss of memory, which
  didn't show in ordinary intercourse, there couldn't have seemed much wrong
  with him.</p>

  <p>"A few nights after leaving Japan, Sieveking was prevailed upon to give a
  piano recital on board, and Conway and I went to hear him. He played well, of
  course, some Brahms and Scarlatti, and a lot of Chopin. Once or twice I
  glanced at Conway and judged that he was enjoying it all, which appeared very
  natural, in view of his own musical past. At the end of the program the show
  lengthened out into an informal series of encores which Sieveking bestowed,
  very amiably, I thought, upon a few enthusiasts grouped round the piano.
  Again he played mostly Chopin; he rather specializes in it, you know. At last
  he left the piano and moved towards the door, still followed by admirers, but
  evidently feeling that he had done enough for them. In the meantime a rather
  odd thing was beginning to happen. Conway had sat down at the keyboard and
  was playing some rapid, lively piece that I didn't recognize, but which drew
  Sieveking back in great excitement to ask what it was. Conway, after a long
  and rather strange silence, could only reply that he didn't know. Sieveking
  exclaimed that it was incredible, and grew more excited still. Conway then
  made what appeared to be a tremendous physical and mental effort to remember,
  and said at last that the thing was a Chopin study. I didn't think myself it
  could be, and I wasn't surprised when Sieveking denied it absolutely. Conway,
  however, grew suddenly quite indignant about the matter&mdash;which startled
  me, because up to then he had shown so little emotion about anything. 'My
  dear fellow,' Sieveking remonstrated, 'I know everything of Chopin's that
  exists, and I can assure you that he never wrote what you have just played.
  He might well have done so, because it's utterly his style, but he just
  didn't. I challenge you to show me the score in any of the editions.' To
  which Conway replied at length: 'Oh, yes, I remember now, it was never
  printed. I only know it myself from meeting a man who used to be one of
  Chopin's pupils... Here's another unpublished thing I learned from him.'"</p>

  <p>Rutherford studied me with his eyes as he went on: "I don't know if you're
  a musician, but even if you're not, I daresay you'll be able to imagine
  something of Sieveking's excitement, and mine, too, as Conway continued to
  play. To me, of course, it was a sudden and quite mystifying glimpse into his
  past, the first clue of any kind that had escaped. Sieveking was naturally
  engrossed in the musical problem, which was perplexing enough, as you'll
  realize when I remind you that Chopin died in 1849.</p>

  <p>"The whole incident was so unfathomable, in a sense, that perhaps I should
  add that there were at least a dozen witnesses of it, including a California
  university professor of some repute. Of course, it was easy to say that
  Conway's explanation was chronologically impossible, or almost so; but there
  was still the music itself to be explained. If it wasn't what Conway said it
  was, then what WAS it? Sieveking assured me that if those two pieces were
  published, they would be in every virtuoso's repertoire within six months.
  Even if this is an exaggeration, it shows Sieveking's opinion of them. After
  much argument at the time, we weren't able to settle anything, for Conway
  stuck to his story, and as he was beginning to look fatigued, I was anxious
  to get him away from the crowd and off to bed. The last episode was about
  making some phonograph records. Sieveking said he would fix up all
  arrangements as soon as he reached America, and Conway gave his promise to
  play before the microphone. I often feel it was a great pity, from every
  point of view, that he wasn't able to keep his word."</p>

  <p>Rutherford glanced at his watch and impressed on me that I should have
  plenty of time to catch my train, since his story was practically finished.
  "Because that night&mdash;the night after the recital&mdash;he got back his
  memory. We had both gone to bed and I was lying awake, when he came into my
  cabin and told me. His face had stiffened into what I can only describe as an
  expression of overwhelming sadness&mdash;a sort of universal sadness, if you
  know what I mean&mdash;something remote or impersonal, a Wehmut or
  Weltschmerz, or whatever the Germans call it. He said he could call to mind
  everything, that it had begun to come back to him during Sieveking's playing,
  though only in patches at first. He sat for a long while on the edge of my
  bed, and I let him take his own time and make his own method of telling me. I
  said that I was glad his memory had returned, but sorry if he already wished
  that it hadn't. He looked up then and paid me what I shall always regard as a
  marvelously high compliment. 'Thank God, Rutherford,' he said, 'you are
  capable of imagining things.' After a while I dressed and persuaded him to do
  the same, and we walked up and down the boat deck. It was a calm night,
  starry and very warm, and the sea had a pale, sticky look, like condensed
  milk. Except for the vibration of the engines, we might have been pacing an
  esplanade. I let Conway go on in his own way, without questions at first.
  Somewhere about dawn he began to talk consecutively, and it was
  breakfast-time and hot sunshine when he had finished. When I say 'finished' I
  don't mean that there was nothing more to tell me after that first
  confession. He filled in a good many important gaps during the next
  twenty-four hours. He was very unhappy, and couldn't have slept, so we talked
  almost constantly. About the middle of the following night the ship was due
  to reach Honolulu. We had drinks in my cabin the evening before; he left me
  about ten o'clock, and I never saw him again."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean&mdash;" I had a picture in mind of a very calm, deliberate
  suicide I once saw on the mail boat from Holyhead to Kingstown.</p>

  <p>Rutherford laughed. "Oh, Lord, no&mdash;he wasn't that sort. He just gave
  me the slip. It was easy enough to get ashore, but he must have found it hard
  to avoid being traced when I set people searching for him, as of course I
  did. Afterwards I learned that he'd managed to join the crew of a banana boat
  going south to Fiji."</p>

  <p>"How did you get to know that?"</p>

  <p>"Quite straightforwardly. He wrote to me, three months later, from
  Bangkok, enclosing a draft to pay the expenses I'd been put to on his
  account. He thanked me and said he was very fit. He also said he was about to
  set out on a long journey&mdash;to the northwest. That was all."</p>

  <p>"Where did he mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's pretty vague, isn't it? A good many places lie to the northwest
  of Bangkok. Even Berlin does, for that matter."</p>

  <p>Rutherford paused and filled up my glass and his own. It had been a queer
  story&mdash;or else he had made it seem so; I hardly knew which. The music
  part of it, though puzzling, did not interest me so much as the mystery of
  Conway's arrival at that Chinese mission hospital; and I made this comment.
  Rutherford answered that in point of fact they were both parts of the same
  problem. "Well, how DID he get to Chung-Kiang?" I asked. "I suppose he told
  you all about it that night on the ship?"</p>

  <p>"He told me something about it, and it would be absurd for me, after
  letting you know so much, to be secretive about the rest. Only, to begin
  with, it's a longish sort of tale, and there wouldn't be time even to outline
  it before you'd have to be off for your train. And besides, as it happens,
  there's a more convenient way. I'm a little diffident about revealing the
  tricks of my dishonorable calling, but the truth is, Conway's story, as I
  pondered over it afterwards, appealed to me enormously. I had begun by making
  simple notes after our various conversations on the ship, so that I shouldn't
  forget details; later, as certain aspects of the thing began to grip me, I
  had the urge to do more, to fashion the written and recollected fragments
  into a single narrative. By that I don't mean that I invented or altered
  anything. There was quite enough material in what he told me: he was a fluent
  talker and had a natural gift for communicating an atmosphere. Also, I
  suppose, I felt I was beginning to understand the man himself." He went to an
  attaché case, and took out a bundle of typed manuscript. "Well, here it is,
  anyhow, and you can make what you like of it."</p>

  <p>"By which I suppose you mean that I'm not expected to believe it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hardly so definite a warning as that. But mind, if you DO believe, it
  will be for Tertullian's famous reason&mdash;you remember? quia impossibile
  est. Not a bad argument, maybe. Let me know what you think, at all
  events."</p>

  <p>I took the manuscript away with me and read most of it on the Ostend
  express. I intended returning it with a long letter when I reached England,
  but there were delays, and before I could post it I got a short note from
  Rutherford to say that he was off on his wanderings again and would have no
  settled address for some months. He was going to Kashmir, he wrote, and
  thence "east." I was not surprised.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During that third week of May the situation in Baskul had
  become much worse and, on the 20th, air force machines arrived by arrangement
  from Peshawar to evacuate the white residents. These numbered about eighty,
  and most were safely transported across the mountains in troop carriers. A
  few miscellaneous aircraft were also employed, among them being a cabin
  machine lent by the maharajah of Chandrapur. In this, about 10 a.m., four
  passengers embarked: Miss Roberta Brinklow, of the Eastern Mission; Henry D.
  Barnard, an American; Hugh Conway, H.M. Consul; and Captain Charles
  Mallinson, H.M. Vice Consul.</p>

  <p>These names are as they appeared later in Indian and British
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>Conway was thirty-seven. He had been at Baskul for two years, in a job
  which now, in the light of events, could be regarded as a persistent backing
  of the wrong horse. A stage of his life was finished; in a few weeks' time,
  or perhaps after a few months' leave in England, he would be sent somewhere
  else. Tokyo or Teheran, Manila or Muscat; people in his profession never knew
  what was coming. He had been ten years in the Consular Service, long enough
  to assess his own chances as shrewdly as he was apt to do those of others. He
  knew that the plums were not for him; but it was genuinely consoling, and not
  merely sour grapes, to reflect that he had no taste for plums. He preferred
  the less formal and more picturesque jobs that were on offer, and as these
  were often not good ones, it had doubtless seemed to others that he was
  playing his cards rather badly. Actually, he felt he had played them rather
  well; he had had a varied and moderately enjoyable decade.</p>

  <p>He was tall, deeply bronzed, with brown short-cropped hair and slate-blue
  eyes. He was inclined to look severe and brooding until he laughed, and then
  (but it happened not so very often) he looked boyish. There was a slight
  nervous twitch near the left eye which was usually noticeable when he worked
  too hard or drank too much, and as he had been packing and destroying
  documents throughout the whole of the day and night preceding the evacuation,
  the twitch was very conspicuous when he climbed into the aeroplane. He was
  tired out, and overwhelmingly glad that he had contrived to be sent in the
  maharajah's luxurious airliner instead of in one of the crowded troop
  carriers. He spread himself indulgently in the basket seat as the plane
  soared aloft. He was the sort of man who, being used to major hardships,
  expected minor comforts by way of compensation. Cheerfully he might endure
  the rigors of the road to Samarkand, but from London to Paris he would spend
  his last tenner on the Golden Arrow.</p>

  <p>It was after the flight had lasted more than an hour that Mallinson said
  he thought the pilot wasn't keeping a straight course. Mallinson sat
  immediately in front. He was a youngster in his middle twenties,
  pink-cheeked, intelligent without being intellectual, beset with public
  school limitations, but also with their excellences. Failure to pass an
  examination was the chief cause of his being sent to Baskul, where Conway had
  had six months of his company and had grown to like him.</p>

  <p>But Conway did not want to make the effort that an aeroplane conversation
  demands. He opened his eyes drowsily and replied that whatever the course
  taken, the pilot presumably knew best.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, when weariness and the drone of the engine had lulled
  him nearly to sleep, Mallinson disturbed him again. "I say, Conway, I thought
  Fenner was piloting us?"</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"The chap turned his head just now and I'll swear it wasn't he."</p>

  <p>"It's hard to tell, through that glass panel."</p>

  <p>"I'd know Fenner's face anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, it must be someone else. I don't see that it matters."</p>

  <p>"But Fenner told me definitely that he was taking this machine."</p>

  <p>"They must have changed their minds and given him one of the others."</p>

  <p>"Well, who is this man, then?"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, how should I know? You don't suppose I've memorized the face
  of every flight lieutenant in the air force, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I know a good many of them, anyway, but I don't recognize this
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"Then he must belong to the minority whom you don't know." Conway smiled
  and added: "When we arrive in Peshawar very soon you can make his
  acquaintance and ask him all about himself."</p>

  <p>"At this rate we shan't get to Peshawar at all. The man's right off his
  course. And I'm not surprised, either&mdash;flying so damned high he can't
  see where he is."</p>

  <p>Conway was not bothering. He was used to air travel, and took things for
  granted. Besides, there was nothing particular he was eager to do when he got
  to Peshawar, and no one particular he was eager to see; so it was a matter of
  complete indifference to him whether the journey took four hours or six. He
  was unmarried; there would be no tender greetings on arrival. He had friends,
  and a few of them would probably take him to the club and stand him drinks;
  it was a pleasant prospect, but not one to sigh for in anticipation.</p>

  <p>Nor did he sigh retrospectively, when he viewed the equally pleasant, but
  not wholly satisfying vista of the past decade. Changeable, fair intervals,
  becoming rather unsettled; it had been his own meteorological summary during
  that time, as well as the world's. He thought of Baskul, Pekin, Macao, and
  other places&mdash;he had moved about pretty often. Remotest of all was
  Oxford, where he had had a couple of years of donhood after the war,
  lecturing on Oriental history, breathing dust in sunny libraries, cruising
  down the High on a push bicycle. The vision attracted, but did not stir him;
  there was a sense in which he felt that he was still a part of all that he
  might have been.</p>

  <p>A familiar gastric lurch informed him that the plane was beginning to
  descend. He felt tempted to rag Mallinson about his fidgets, and would
  perhaps have done so had not the youth risen abruptly, bumping his head
  against the roof and waking Barnard, the American, who had been dozing in his
  seat at the other side of the narrow gangway. "My God!" Mallinson cried,
  peering through the window. "Look down there!"</p>

  <p>Conway looked. The view was certainly not what he had expected, if,
  indeed, he had expected anything. Instead of the trim, geometrically laid-out
  cantonments and the larger oblongs of the hangars, nothing was visible but an
  opaque mist veiling an immense, sun-brown desolation. The plane, though
  descending rapidly, was still at a height unusual for ordinary flying. Long,
  corrugated mountain ridges could be picked out, perhaps a mile or so closer
  than the cloudier smudge of the valleys. It was typical frontier scenery,
  though Conway had never viewed it before from such an altitude. It was also,
  which struck him as odd, nowhere that he could imagine near Peshawar. "I
  don't recognize this part of the world," he commented. Then, more privately,
  for he did not wish to alarm the others, he added into Mallinson's ear:
  "Looks as if you're right. The man's lost his way."</p>

  <p>The plane was swooping down at a tremendous speed, and as it did so, the
  air grew hotter; the scorched earth below was like an oven with the door
  suddenly opened. One mountaintop after another lifted itself above the
  horizon in craggy silhouette; now the flight was along a curving valley, the
  base of which was strewn with rocks and the debris of dried-up watercourses.
  It looked like a floor littered with nutshells. The plane bumped and tossed
  in air pockets as uncomfortably as a rowboat in a swell. All four passengers
  had to hold onto their seats.</p>

  <p>"Looks like he wants to land!" shouted the American hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"He can't!" Mallinson retorted. "He'd be simply mad if he tried to! He'll
  crash and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the pilot did land. A small cleared space opened by the side of a
  gully, and with considerable skill the machine was jolted and heaved to a
  standstill. What happened after that, however, was more puzzling and less
  reassuring. A swarm of bearded and turbaned tribesmen came forward from all
  directions, surrounding the machine and effectively preventing anyone from
  getting out of it except the pilot. The latter clambered to earth and held
  excited colloquy with them, during which proceeding it became clear that, so
  far from being Fenner, he was not an Englishman at all, and possibly not even
  a European. Meanwhile cans of gasoline were fetched from a dump close by, and
  emptied into the exceptionally capacious tanks. Grins and disregarding
  silence met the shouts of the four imprisoned passengers, while the slightest
  attempt to alight provoked a menacing movement from a score of rifles.
  Conway, who knew a little Pushtu, harangued the tribesmen as well as he could
  in that language, but without effect; while the pilot's sole retort to any
  remarks addressed to him in any language was a significant flourish of his
  revolver. Midday sunlight, blazing on the roof of the cabin, grilled the air
  inside till the occupants were almost fainting with the heat and with the
  exertion of their protests. They were quite powerless; it had been a
  condition of the evacuation that they should carry no arms.</p>

  <p>When the tanks were at last screwed up, a gasoline can filled with tepid
  water was handed through one of the cabin windows. No questions were
  answered, though it did not appear that the men were personally hostile.
  After a further parley the pilot climbed back into the cockpit, a Pathan
  clumsily swung the propeller, and the flight was resumed. The takeoff, in
  that confined space and with the extra gasoline load, was even more skillful
  than the landing. The plane rose high into the hazy vapors; then turned east,
  as if setting a course. It was mid-afternoon.</p>

  <p>A most extraordinary and bewildering business! As the cooler air refreshed
  them, the passengers could hardly believe that it had really happened; it was
  an outrage to which none could recall any parallel, or suggest any precedent,
  in all the turbulent records of the frontier. It would have been incredible,
  indeed, had they not been victims of it themselves. It was quite natural that
  high indignation should follow incredulity, and anxious speculation only when
  indignation had worn itself out. Mallinson then developed the theory which,
  in the absence of any other, they found easiest to accept. They were being
  kidnaped for ransom. The trick was by no means new in itself, though this
  particular technique must be regarded as original. It was a little more
  comforting to feel that they were not making entirely virgin history; after
  all, there had been kidnapings before, and a good many of them had ended up
  all right. The tribesmen kept you in some lair in the mountains till the
  government paid up and you were released. You were treated quite decently,
  and as the money that had to be paid wasn't your own, the whole business was
  only unpleasant while it lasted. Afterwards, of course, the Air people sent a
  bombing squadron, and you were left with one good story to tell for the rest
  of your life. Mallinson enunciated the proposition a shade nervously; but
  Barnard, the American, chose to be heavily facetious. "Well, gentlemen, I
  daresay this is a cute idea on somebody's part, but I can't exactly see that
  your air force has covered itself with glory. You Britishers make jokes about
  the holdups in Chicago and all that, but I don't recollect any instance of a
  gunman running off with one of Uncle Sam's aeroplanes. And I should like to
  know, by the way, what this fellow did with the real pilot. Sandbagged him, I
  bet." He yawned. He was a large, fleshy man, with a hard-bitten face in which
  good-humored wrinkles were not quite offset by pessimistic pouches. Nobody in
  Baskul had known much about him except that he had arrived from Persia, where
  it was presumed he had something to do with oil.</p>

  <p>Conway meanwhile was busying himself with a very practical task. He had
  collected every scrap of paper that they all had, and was composing messages
  in various native languages to be dropped to earth at intervals. It was a
  slender chance, in such sparsely populated country, but worth taking.</p>

  <p>The fourth occupant, Miss Brinklow, sat tight-lipped and straight-backed,
  with few comments and no complaints. She was a small, rather leathery woman,
  with an air of having been compelled to attend a party at which there were
  goings-on that she could not wholly approve.</p>

  <p>Conway had talked less than the two other men, for translating SOS
  messages into dialects was a mental exercise requiring concentration. He had,
  however, answered questions when asked, and had agreed, tentatively, with
  Mallinson's kidnaping theory. He had also agreed, to some extent, with
  Barnard's strictures on the air force. "Though one can see, of course, how it
  may have happened. With the place in commotion as it was, one man in flying
  kit would look very much like another. No one would think of doubting the
  bona fides of any man in the proper clothes who looked as if he knew his job.
  And this fellow MUST have known it&mdash;the signals, and so forth. Pretty
  obvious, too, that he knows how to fly... still, I agree with you that it's
  the sort of thing that someone ought to get into hot water about. And
  somebody will, you may be sure, though I suspect he won't deserve it."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," responded Barnard, "I certainly do admire the way you manage
  to see both sides of the question. It's the right spirit to have, no doubt,
  even when you're being taken for a ride."</p>

  <p>Americans, Conway reflected, had the knack of being able to say
  patronizing things without being offensive. He smiled tolerantly, but did not
  continue the conversation. His tiredness was of a kind that no amount of
  possible peril could stave off. Towards late afternoon, when Barnard and
  Mallinson, who had been arguing, appealed to him on some point, it appeared
  that he had fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>"Dead beat," Mallinson commented. "And I don't wonder at it, after these
  last few weeks."</p>

  <p>"You're his friend?" queried Barnard.</p>

  <p>"I've worked with him at the Consulate. I happen to know that he hasn't
  been in bed for the last four nights. As a matter of fact, we're damned lucky
  in having him with us in a tight corner like this. Apart from knowing the
  languages, he's got a sort of way with him in dealing with people. If anyone
  can get us out of the mess, he'll do it. He's pretty cool about most
  things."</p>

  <p>"Well, let him have his sleep, then," agreed Barnard.</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow made one of her rare remarks. "I think he LOOKS like a very
  brave man," she said.</p>

  <p>Conway was far less certain that he WAS a very brave man. He had closed
  his eyes in sheer physical fatigue, but without actually sleeping. He could
  hear and feel every movement of the plane, and he heard also, with mixed
  feelings, Mallinson's eulogy of himself. It was then that he had his doubts,
  recognizing a tight sensation in his stomach which was his own bodily
  reaction to a disquieting mental survey. He was not, as he knew well from
  experience, one of those persons who love danger for its own sake. There was
  an aspect of it which he sometimes enjoyed, an excitement, a purgative effect
  upon sluggish emotions, but he was far from fond of risking his life. Twelve
  years earlier he had grown to hate the perils of trench warfare in France,
  and had several times avoided death by declining to attempt valorous
  impossibilities. Even his D.S.O. had been won, not so much by physical
  courage, as by a certain hardly developed technique of endurance. And since
  the war, whenever there had been danger ahead, he had faced it with
  increasing lack of relish unless it promised extravagant dividends in
  thrills.</p>

  <p>He still kept his eyes closed. He was touched, and a little dismayed, by
  what he had heard Mallinson say. It was his fate in life to have his
  equanimity always mistaken for pluck, whereas it was actually something much
  more dispassionate and much less virile. They were all in a damnably awkward
  situation, it seemed to him, and so far from being full of bravery about it,
  he felt chiefly an enormous distaste for whatever trouble might be in store.
  There was Miss Brinklow, for instance. He foresaw that in certain
  circumstances he would have to act on the supposition that because she was a
  woman she mattered far more than the rest of them put together, and he shrank
  from a situation in which such disproportionate behavior might be
  unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when he showed signs of wakefulness, it was to Miss Brinklow
  that he spoke first. He realized that she was neither young nor pretty
  &mdash;negative virtues, but immensely helpful ones in such difficulties as
  those in which they might soon find themselves. He was also rather sorry for
  her, because he suspected that neither Mallinson nor the American liked
  missionaries, especially female ones. He himself was unprejudiced, but he was
  afraid she would find his open mind a less familiar and therefore an even
  more disconcerting phenomenon. "We seem to be in a queer fix," he said,
  leaning forward to her ear, "but I'm glad you're taking it calmly. I don't
  really think anything dreadful is going to happen to us."</p>

  <p>"I'm certain it won't if you can prevent it," she answered; which did not
  console him.</p>

  <p>"You must let me know if there is anything we can do to make you more
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>Barnard caught the word. "Comfortable?" he echoed raucously. "Why, of
  course we're comfortable. We're just enjoying the trip. Pity we haven't a
  pack of cards&mdash;we could play a rubber of bridge."</p>

  <p>Conway welcomed the spirit of the remark, though he disliked bridge. "I
  don't suppose Miss Brinklow plays," he said, smiling.</p>

  <p>But the missionary turned round briskly to retort: "Indeed I do, and I
  could never see any harm in cards at all. There's nothing against them in the
  Bible."</p>

  <p>They all laughed, and seemed obliged to her for providing an excuse. At
  any rate, Conway thought, she wasn't hysterical.</p>

  <p>All afternoon the plane had soared through the thin mists of the upper
  atmosphere, far too high to give clear sight of what lay beneath. Sometimes,
  at longish intervals, the veil was torn for a moment, to display the jagged
  outline of a peak, or the glint of some unknown stream. The direction could
  be determined roughly from the sun; it was still east, with occasional twists
  to the north; but where it had led depended on the speed of travel, which
  Conway could not judge with any accuracy. It seemed likely, though, that the
  flight must already have exhausted a good deal of the gasoline; though that
  again depended on uncertain factors. Conway had no technical knowledge of
  aircraft, but he was sure that the pilot, whoever he might be, was altogether
  an expert. That halt in the rock-strewn valley had demonstrated it, and also
  other incidents since. And Conway could not repress a feeling that was always
  his in the presence of any superb and indisputable competence. He was so used
  to being appealed to for help that mere awareness of someone who would
  neither ask nor need it was slightly tranquilizing, even amidst the greater
  perplexities of the future. But he did not expect his companions to share
  such a tenuous emotion. He recognized that they were likely to have far more
  personal reasons for anxiety than he had himself. Mallinson, for instance,
  was engaged to a girl in England; Barnard might be married; Miss Brinklow had
  her work, vocation, or however she might regard it. Mallinson, incidentally,
  was by far the least composed; as the hours passed he showed himself
  increasingly excitable&mdash;apt, also, to resent to Conway's face the very
  coolness which he had praised behind his back. Once, above the roar of the
  engine, a sharp storm of argument arose. "Look here," Mallinson shouted
  angrily, "are we bound to sit here twiddling our thumbs while this maniac
  does everything he damn well wants? What's to prevent us from smashing that
  panel and having it out with him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," replied Conway, "except that he's armed and we're not,
  and that in any case, none of us would know how to bring the machine to earth
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"It can't be very hard, surely. I daresay you could do it."</p>

  <p>"My dear Mallinson, why is it always ME you expect to perform these
  miracles?"</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway, this business is getting hellishly on my nerves. Can't we
  MAKE the fellow come down?"</p>

  <p>"How do you suggest it should be done?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson was becoming more and more agitated. "Well, he's THERE, isn't
  he? About six feet away from us, and we're three men to one! Have we got to
  stare at his damned back all the time? At least we might force him to tell us
  what the game is."</p>

  <p>"Very well, we'll see." Conway took a few paces forward to the partition
  between the cabin and the pilot's cockpit, which was situated in front and
  somewhat above. There was a pane of glass, about six inches square and made
  to slide open, through which the pilot, by turning his head and stooping
  slightly, could communicate with his passengers. Conway tapped on this with
  his knuckles. The response was almost comically as he had expected. The glass
  panel slid sideways and the barrel of a revolver obtruded. Not a word; just
  that. Conway retreated without arguing the point, and the panel slid back
  again.</p>

  <p>Mallinson, who had watched the incident, was only partly satisfied. "I
  don't suppose he'd have dared to shoot," he commented. "It's probably
  bluff."</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Conway, "but I'd rather leave you to make sure."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do feel we ought to put up some sort of a fight before giving in
  tamely like this."</p>

  <p>Conway was sympathetic. He recognized the convention, with all its
  associations of red-coated soldiers and school history books, that Englishmen
  fear nothing, never surrender, and are never defeated. He said: "Putting up a
  fight without a decent chance of winning is a poor game, and I'm not that
  sort of hero."</p>

  <p>"Good for you, sir," interposed Barnard heartily. "When somebody's got you
  by the short hairs you may as well give in pleasantly and admit it. For my
  part I'm going to enjoy life while it lasts and have a cigar. I hope you
  don't think a little bit of extra danger matters to us?"</p>

  <p>"Not so far as I'm concerned, but it might bother Miss Brinklow."</p>

  <p>Barnard was quick to make amends. "Pardon me, madam, but do you mind if I
  smoke?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered graciously. "I don't do so myself, but I just
  love the smell of a cigar."</p>

  <p>Conway felt that of all the women who could possibly have made such a
  remark, she was easily the most typical. Anyhow, Mallinson's excitement had
  calmed a little, and to show friendliness he offered him a cigarette, though
  he did not light one himself. "I know how you feel," he said gently. "It's a
  bad outlook, and it's all the worse, in some ways, because there isn't much
  we can do about it."</p>

  <p>"And all the better, too, in other ways," he could not help adding to
  himself. For he was still immensely fatigued. There was also in his nature a
  trait which some people might have called laziness, though it was not quite
  that. No one was capable of harder work, when it had to be done, and few
  could better shoulder responsibility; but the facts remained that he was not
  passionately fond of activity, and did not enjoy responsibility at all. Both
  were included in his job, and he made the best of them, but he was always
  ready to give way to anyone else who could function as well or better. It was
  partly this, no doubt, that had made his success in the Service less striking
  than it might have been. He was not ambitious enough to shove his way past
  others, or to make an important parade of doing nothing when there was really
  nothing doing. His dispatches were sometimes laconic to the point of
  curtness, and his calm in emergencies, though admired, was often suspected of
  being too sincere. Authority likes to feel that a man is imposing some effort
  on himself, and that his apparent nonchalance is only a cloak to disguise an
  outfit of well-bred emotions. With Conway the dark suspicion had sometimes
  been current that he really was as unruffled as he looked, and that whatever
  happened, he did not give a damn. But this, too, like the laziness, was an
  imperfect interpretation. What most observers failed to perceive in him was
  something quite bafflingly simple&mdash;a love of quietness, contemplation,
  and being alone.</p>

  <p>Now, since he was so inclined and there was nothing else to do, he leaned
  back in the basket chair and went definitely to sleep. When he woke he
  noticed that the others, despite their various anxieties, had likewise
  succumbed. Miss Brinklow was sitting bolt upright with her eyes closed, like
  some rather dingy and outmoded idol; Mallinson had lolled forward in his
  place with his chin in the palm of a hand. The American was even snoring.
  Very sensible of them all, Conway thought; there was no point in wearying
  themselves with shouting. But immediately he was aware of certain physical
  sensations in himself, slight dizziness and heart-thumping and a tendency to
  inhale sharply and with effort. He remembered similar symptoms once before
  &mdash;in the Swiss Alps.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the window and gazed out. The surrounding sky had
  cleared completely, and in the light of late afternoon there came to him a
  vision which, for the instant, snatched the remaining breath out of his
  lungs. Far away, at the very limit of distance, lay range upon range of snow
  peaks, festooned with glaciers, and floating, in appearance, upon vast levels
  of cloud. They compassed the whole arc of the circle, merging towards the
  west in a horizon that was fierce, almost garish in coloring, like an
  impressionist backdrop done by some half-mad genius. And meanwhile, the
  plane, on that stupendous stage, was droning over an abyss in the face of a
  sheer white wall that seemed part of the sky itself until the sun caught it.
  Then, like a dozen piled-up Jungfraus seen from Mürren, it flamed into superb
  and dazzling incandescence.</p>

  <p>Conway was not apt to be easily impressed, and as a rule he did not care
  for "views," especially the more famous ones for which thoughtful
  municipalities provide garden seats. Once, on being taken to Tiger Hill, near
  Darjeeling, to watch the sunrise upon Everest, he had found the highest
  mountain in the world a definite disappointment. But this fearsome spectacle
  beyond the window-pane was of different caliber; it had no air of posing to
  be admired. There was something raw and monstrous about those uncompromising
  ice cliffs, and a certain sublime impertinence in approaching them thus. He
  pondered, envisioning maps, calculating distances, estimating times and
  speeds. Then he became aware that Mallinson had wakened also. He touched the
  youth on the arm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was typical of Conway that he let the others waken for
  themselves, and made small response to their exclamations of astonishment;
  yet later, when Barnard sought his opinion, gave it with something of the
  detached fluency of a university professor elucidating a problem. He thought
  it likely, he said, that they were still in India; they had been flying east
  for several hours, too high to see much, but probably the course had been
  along some river valley, one stretching roughly east and west. "I wish I
  hadn't to rely on memory, but my impression is that the valley of the upper
  Indus fits in well enough. That would have brought us by now to a very
  spectacular part of the world, and, as you see, so it has."</p>

  <p>"You know where we are, then?" Barnard interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Well, no&mdash;I've never been anywhere near here before, but I wouldn't
  be surprised if that mountain is Nanga Parbat, the one Mummery lost his life
  on. In structure and general layout it seems in accord with all I've heard
  about it."</p>

  <p>"You are a mountaineer yourself?"</p>

  <p>"In my younger days I was keen. Only the usual Swiss climbs, of
  course."</p>

  <p>Mallinson intervened peevishly: "There'd be more point in discussing where
  we're going to. I wish to God somebody could tell us."</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks to me as if we're heading for that range yonder," said
  Barnard. "Don't you think so, Conway? You'll excuse me calling you that, but
  if we're all going to have a little adventure together, it's a pity to stand
  on ceremony."</p>

  <p>Conway thought it very natural that anyone should call him by his own
  name, and found Barnard's apologies for so doing a trifle needless. "Oh,
  certainly," he agreed, and added: "I think that range must be the Karakorams.
  There are several passes if our man intends to cross them."</p>

  <p>"Our man?" exclaimed Mallinson. "You mean our maniac! I reckon it's time
  we dropped the kidnaping theory. We're far past the frontier country by now,
  there aren't any tribes living around here. The only explanation I can think
  of is that the fellow's a raving lunatic. Would anybody except a lunatic fly
  into this sort of country?"</p>

  <p>"I know that nobody except a damn fine airman COULD," retorted Barnard. "I
  never was great at geography, but I understand that these are reputed to be
  the highest mountains in the world, and if that's so, it'll be a pretty
  first-class performance to cross them."</p>

  <p>"And also the will of God," put in Miss Brinklow unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Conway did not offer his opinion. The will of God or the lunacy of man
  &mdash;it seemed to him that you could take your choice, if you wanted a good
  enough reason for most things. Or, alternatively (and he thought of it as he
  contemplated the small orderliness of the cabin against the window background
  of such frantic natural scenery), the will of man and the lunacy of God. It
  must be satisfying to be quite certain which way to look at it. Then, while
  he watched and pondered, a strange transformation took place. The light
  turned to bluish over the whole mountain, with the lower slopes darkening to
  violet. Something deeper than his usual aloofness rose in him &mdash;not
  quite excitement, still less fear, but a sharp intensity of expectation. He
  said: "You're quite right, Barnard, this affair grows more and more
  remarkable."</p>

  <p>"Remarkable or not, I don't feel inclined to propose a vote of thanks
  about it," Mallinson persisted. "We didn't ask to be brought here, and heaven
  knows what we shall do when we get THERE, wherever THERE is. And I don't see
  that it's any less of an outrage because the fellow happens to be a stunt
  flyer. Even if he is, he can be just as much a lunatic. I once heard of a
  pilot going mad in midair. This fellow must have been mad from the beginning.
  That's my theory, Conway."</p>

  <p>Conway was silent. He found it irksome to be continually shouting above
  the roar of the machine, and after all, there was little point in arguing
  possibilities. But when Mallinson pressed for an opinion, he said: "Very
  well-organized lunacy, you know. Don't forget the landing for gasoline, and
  also that this was the only machine that could climb to such a height."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't prove he isn't mad. He may have been mad enough to plan
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, that's possible."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, we've got to decide on a plan of action. What are we going to
  do when he comes to earth? If he doesn't crash and kill us all, that is. What
  are we going to do? Rush forward and congratulate him on his marvelous
  flight, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," answered Barnard. "I'll leave you to do all the
  rushing forward."</p>

  <p>Again Conway was loth to prolong the argument, especially since the
  American, with his levelheaded banter, seemed quite capable of handling it
  himself. Already Conway found himself reflecting that the party might have
  been far less fortunately constituted. Only Mallinson was inclined to be
  cantankerous, and that might partly be due to the altitude. Rarefied air had
  different effects on people; Conway, for instance, derived from it a
  combination of mental clarity and physical apathy that was not unpleasant.
  Indeed, he breathed the clear cold air in little spasms of content. The whole
  situation, no doubt, was appalling, but he had no power at the moment to
  resent anything that proceeded so purposefully and with such captivating
  interest.</p>

  <p>And there came over him, too, as he stared at that superb mountain, a glow
  of satisfaction that there were such places still left on earth, distant,
  inaccessible, as yet unhumanized. The icy rampart of the Karakorams was now
  more striking than ever against the northern sky, which had become
  mouse-colored and sinister; the peaks had a chill gleam; utterly majestic and
  remote, their very namelessness had dignity. Those few thousand feet by which
  they fell short of the known giants might save them eternally from the
  climbing expedition; they offered a less tempting lure to the record-breaker.
  Conway was the antithesis of such a type; he was inclined to see vulgarity in
  the Western ideal of superlatives, and "the utmost for the highest" seemed to
  him a less reasonable and perhaps more commonplace proposition than "the much
  for the high." He did not, in fact, care for excessive striving, and he was
  bored by mere exploits.</p>

  <p>While he was still contemplating the scene, twilight fell, steeping the
  depths in a rich, velvet gloom that spread upwards like a dye. Then the whole
  range, much nearer now, paled into fresh splendor; a full moon rose, touching
  each peak in succession like some celestial lamplighter, until the long
  horizon glittered against a blue-black sky. The air grew cold and a wind
  sprang up, tossing the machine uncomfortably. These new distresses lowered
  the spirits of the passengers; it had not been reckoned that the flight could
  go on after dusk, and now the last hope lay in the exhaustion of gasoline.
  That, however, was bound to come soon. Mallinson began to argue about it, and
  Conway, with some reluctance, for he really did not know, gave as his
  estimate that the utmost distance might be anything up to a thousand miles,
  of which they must already have covered most. "Well, where would that bring
  us?" queried the youth miserably.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to judge, but probably some part of Tibet. If these are the
  Karakorams, Tibet lies beyond. One of the crests, by the way, must be K2,
  which is generally counted the second highest mountain in the world."</p>

  <p>"Next on the list after Everest," commented Barnard. "Gee, this is some
  scenery."</p>

  <p>"And from a climber's point of view much stiffer than Everest. The Duke of
  Abruzzi gave it up as an absolutely impossible peak."</p>

  <p>"OH, GOD!" muttered Mallinson testily, but Barnard laughed. "I guess you
  must be the official guide on this trip, Conway, and I'll admit that if I
  only had a flash of café cognac I wouldn't care if it's Tibet or
  Tennessee."</p>

  <p>"But what are we going to do about it?" urged Mallinson again. "Why are we
  here? What can be the point of it all? I don't see how you can make jokes
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's as good as making a scene about it, young fellow. Besides, if
  the man IS off his nut, as you've suggested, there probably ISN'T any
  point."</p>

  <p>"He MUST be mad. I can't think of any other explanation. Can you,
  Conway?"</p>

  <p>Conway shook his head.</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow turned round as she might have done during the interval of a
  play. "As you haven't asked my opinion, perhaps I oughtn't to give it," she
  began, with shrill modesty, "but I should like to say that I agree with Mr.
  Mallinson. I'm sure the poor man can't be quite right in his head. The pilot,
  I mean, of course. There would be no excuse for him, anyhow, if he were NOT
  mad." She added, shouting confidentially above the din: "And do you know,
  this is my first trip by air! My very first! Nothing would ever induce me to
  do it before, though a friend of mine tried her very best to persuade me to
  fly from London to Paris."</p>

  <p>"And now you're flying from India to Tibet instead," said Barnard. "That's
  the way things happen."</p>

  <p>She went on: "I once knew a missionary who had been to Tibet. He said the
  Tibetans were very odd people. They believe we are descended from
  monkeys."</p>

  <p>"Real smart of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no, I don't mean in the modern way. They've had the belief for
  hundreds of years, it's only one of their superstitions. Of course I'm
  against all of it myself, and I think Darwin was far worse than any Tibetan.
  I take my stand on the Bible."</p>

  <p>"Fundamentalist, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>But Miss Brinklow did not appear to understand the term. "I used to belong
  to the L.M.S.," she shrieked, "but I disagreed with them about infant
  baptism."</p>

  <p>Conway continued to feel that this was a rather comic remark long after it
  had occurred to him that the initials were those of the London Missionary
  Society. Still picturing the inconveniences of holding a theological argument
  at Euston Station, he began to think that there was something slightly
  fascinating about Miss Brinklow. He even wondered if he could offer her any
  article of his clothing for the night, but decided at length that her
  constitution was probably wirier than his. So he huddled up, closed his eyes,
  and went quite easily and peacefully to sleep.</p>

  <p>And the flight proceeded.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they were all wakened by a lurch of the machine. Conway's head
  struck the window, dazing him for the moment; a returning lurch sent him
  floundering between the two tiers of seats. It was much colder. The first
  thing he did, automatically, was to glance at his watch; it showed half-past
  one, he must have been asleep for some time. His ears were full of a loud,
  flapping sound, which he took to be imaginary until he realized that the
  engine had been shut off and that the plane was rushing against a gale. Then
  he stared through the window and could see the earth quite close, vague and
  snail-gray, scampering underneath. "He's going to land!" Mallinson shouted;
  and Barnard, who had also been flung out of his seat, responded with a
  saturnine: "If he's lucky." Miss Brinklow, whom the entire commotion seemed
  to have disturbed least of all, was adjusting her hat as calmly as if Dover
  Harbor were just in sight.</p>

  <p>Presently the plane touched ground. But it was a bad landing this time
  &mdash;"Oh, my God, damned bad, DAMNED bad!" Mallinson groaned as he clutched
  at his seat during ten seconds of crashing and swaying. Something was heard
  to strain and snap, and one of the tires exploded. "That's done it," he added
  in tones of anguished pessimism. "A broken tailskid, we'll have to stay where
  we are now, that's certain."</p>

  <p>Conway, never talkative at times of crisis, stretched his stiffened legs
  and felt his head where it had banged against the window. A bruise, nothing
  much. He must do something to help these people. But he was the last of the
  four to stand up when the plane came to rest. "Steady," he called out as
  Mallinson wrenched open the door of the cabin and prepared to make the jump
  to earth; and eerily, in the comparative silence, the youth's answer came:
  "No need to be steady&mdash;this looks like the end of the
  world&mdash;there's not a soul about, anyhow."</p>

  <p>A moment later, chilled and shivering, they were all aware that this was
  so. With no sound in their ears save the fierce gusts of wind and their own
  crunching footsteps, they felt themselves at the mercy of something dour and
  savagely melancholy&mdash;a mood in which both earth and air were saturated.
  The moon looked to have disappeared behind clouds, and starlight illumined a
  tremendous emptiness heaving with wind. Without thought or knowledge, one
  could have guessed that this bleak world was mountain-high, and that the
  mountains rising from it were mountains on top of mountains. A range of them
  gleamed on a far horizon like a row of dogteeth.</p>

  <p>Mallinson, feverishly active, was already making for the cockpit. "I'm not
  scared of the fellow on land, whoever he is," he cried. "I'm going to tackle
  him right away..."</p>

  <p>The others watched apprehensively, hypnotized by the spectacle of such
  energy. Conway sprang after him, but too late to prevent the investigation.
  After a few seconds, however, the youth dropped down again, gripping his arm
  and muttering in a hoarse, sobered staccato: "I say, Conway, it's queer... I
  think the fellow's ill or dead or something... I can't get a word out of him.
  Come up and look... I took his revolver, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Better give it to me," said Conway, and though still rather dazed by the
  recent blow on his head, he nerved himself for action. Of all times and
  places and situations on earth, this seemed to him to combine the most
  hideous discomforts. He hoisted himself stiffly into a position from which he
  could see, not very well, into the enclosed cockpit. There was a strong smell
  of gasoline, so he did not risk striking a match. He could just discern the
  pilot, huddled forward, his head sprawling over the controls. He shook him,
  unfastened his helmet, and loosened the clothes round his neck. A moment
  later he turned round to report: "Yes, there's something happened to him. We
  must get him out." But an observer might have added that something had
  happened to Conway as well. His voice was sharper, more incisive; no longer
  did he seem to be hovering on the brink of some profound doubtfulness. The
  time, the place, the cold, his fatigue, were now of less account; there was a
  job that simply had to be done, and the more conventional part of him was
  uppermost and preparing to do it.</p>

  <p>With Barnard and Mallinson assisting, the pilot was extracted from his
  seat and lifted to the ground. He was unconscious, not dead. Conway had no
  particular medical knowledge, but, as to most men who have lived in
  outlandish places, the phenomena of illness were mostly familiar. "Possibly a
  heart attack brought on by the high altitude," he diagnosed, stooping over
  the unknown man. "We can do very little for him out here&mdash;there's no
  shelter from this infernal wind. Better get him inside the cabin, and
  ourselves too. We haven't an idea where we are, and it's hopeless to make a
  move until daylight."</p>

  <p>The verdict and the suggestion were both accepted without dispute. Even
  Mallinson concurred. They carried the man into the cabin and laid him full
  length along the gangway between the seats. The interior was no warmer than
  outside, but offered a screen to the flurries of wind. It was the wind,
  before much time had passed, that became the central preoccupation of them
  all&mdash;the leitmotif, as it were, of the whole mournful night. It was not
  an ordinary wind. It was not merely a strong wind or a cold wind. It was
  somehow a frenzy that lived all around them, a master stamping and ranting
  over his own domain. It tilted the loaded machine and shook it viciously, and
  when Conway glanced through the windows it seemed as if the wind were
  whirling splinters of light out of the stars.</p>

  <p>The stranger lay inert, while Conway, with difficulty in the dimness and
  confined space, made what examination he could by the light of matches. But
  it did not reveal much. "His heart's faint," he said at last, and then Miss
  Brinklow, after groping in her handbag, created a small sensation. "I wonder
  if this would be any use to the poor man," she proffered condescendingly. "I
  never touch a drop myself, but I always carry it with me in case of
  accidents. And this IS a sort of accident, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it was," replied Conway with grimness. He unscrewed the
  bottle, smelt it, and poured some of the brandy into the man's mouth. "Just
  the stuff for him. Thanks." After an interval the slightest movement of
  eyelids was visible. Mallinson suddenly became hysterical. "I can't help it,"
  he cried, laughing wildly. "We all look such a lot of damn fools striking
  matches over a corpse... And he isn't much of a beauty, is he? Chink, I
  should say, if he's anything at all."</p>

  <p>"Possibly." Conway's voice was level and rather severe. "But he's not a
  corpse yet. With a bit of luck we may bring him round."</p>

  <p>"Luck? It'll be his luck, not ours."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure. And shut up for the time being, anyhow."</p>

  <p>There was enough of the schoolboy still in Mallinson to make him respond
  to the curt command of a senior, though he was obviously in poor control of
  himself. Conway, though sorry for him, was more concerned with the immediate
  problem of the pilot, since he, alone of them all, might be able to give some
  explanation of their plight. Conway had no desire to discuss the matter
  further in a merely speculative way; there had been enough of that during the
  journey. He was uneasy now beyond his continuing mental curiosity, for he was
  aware that the whole situation had ceased to be excitingly perilous and was
  threatening to become a trial of endurance ending in catastrophe. Keeping
  vigil throughout that gale-tormented night, he faced facts nonetheless
  frankly because he did not trouble to enunciate them to the others. He
  guessed that the flight had progressed far beyond the western range of the
  Himalayas towards the less known heights of the Kuen-Lun. In that event they
  would by now have reached the loftiest and least hospitable part of the
  earth's surface, the Tibetan plateau, two miles high even in its lowest
  valleys, a vast, uninhabited, and largely unexplored region of windswept
  upland. Somewhere they were, in that forlorn country, marooned in far less
  comfort than on most desert islands. Then abruptly, as if to answer his
  curiosity by increasing it, a rather awe-inspiring change took place. The
  moon, which he had thought to be hidden by clouds, swung over the lip of some
  shadowy eminence and, whilst still not showing itself directly, unveiled the
  darkness ahead. Conway could see the outline of a long valley, with rounded,
  sad-looking low hills on either side jet-black against the deep electric blue
  of the night sky. But it was to the head of the valley that his eyes were led
  irresistibly, for there, soaring into the gap, and magnificent in the full
  shimmer of moonlight, appeared what he took to be the loveliest mountain on
  earth. It was an almost perfect cone of snow, simple in outline as if a child
  had drawn it, and impossible to classify as to size, height or nearness. It
  was so radiant, so serenely poised, that he wondered for a moment if it were
  real at all. Then, while he gazed, a tiny puff clouded the edge of the
  pyramid, giving life to the vision before the faint rumble of the avalanche
  confirmed it.</p>

  <p>He had an impulse to rouse the others to share the spectacle, but decided
  after consideration that its effect might not be tranquilizing. Nor was it
  so, from a commonsense viewpoint; such virgin splendors merely emphasized the
  facts of isolation and danger. There was quite a probability that the nearest
  human settlement was hundreds of miles away. And they had no food; they were
  unarmed except for one revolver; the aeroplane was damaged and almost
  fuel-less, even if anyone had known how to fly. They had no clothes suited to
  the terrific chills and winds; Mallinson's motoring coat and his own ulster
  were quite inadequate, and even Miss Brinklow, woolied and mufflered as for a
  polar expedition (ridiculous, he had thought, on first beholding her), could
  not be feeling happy. They were all, too, except himself, affected by the
  altitude. Even Barnard had sunk into melancholy under the strain. Mallinson
  was muttering to himself; it was clear what would happen to him if these
  hardships went on for long. In face of such distressful prospects Conway
  found himself quite unable to restrain an admiring glance at Miss Brinklow.
  She was not, he reflected, a normal person, no woman who taught Afghans to
  sing hymns could be considered so. But she was, after every calamity, still
  normally abnormal, and he was deeply obliged to her for it. "I hope you're
  not feeling too bad?" he said sympathetically, when he caught her eye.</p>

  <p>"The soldiers during the war had to suffer worse things than this," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>The comparison did not seem to Conway a very valuable one. In point of
  fact, he had never spent a night in the trenches quite so thoroughly
  unpleasant, though doubtless many others had. He had concentrated his
  attention on the pilot, now breathing fitfully and sometimes slightly
  stirring. Probably Mallinson was right in guessing the man Chinese. He had
  the typical Mongol nose and cheekbones, despite his successful impersonation
  of a British flight lieutenant. Mallinson had called him ugly, but Conway,
  who had lived in China, thought him a fairly passable specimen, though now,
  in the burnished circle of match flame, his pallid skin and gaping mouth were
  not pretty.</p>

  <p>The night dragged on, as if each minute were something heavy and tangible
  that had to be pushed to make way for the next. Moonlight faded after a time,
  and with it that distant specter of the mountain; then the triple mischiefs
  of darkness, cold, and wind increased until dawn. As though at its signal,
  the wind dropped, leaving the world in compassionate quietude. Framed in the
  pale triangle ahead, the mountain showed again, gray at first, then silver,
  then pink as the earliest sun rays caught the summit. In the lessening gloom
  the valley itself took shape, revealing a floor of rock and shingle sloping
  upwards. It was not a friendly picture, but to Conway, as he surveyed, there
  came a queer perception of fineness in it, of something that had no romantic
  appeal at all, but a steely, almost an intellectual quality. The white
  pyramid in the distance compelled the mind's assent as passionlessly as a
  Euclidean theorem, and when at last the sun rose into a sky of deep
  delphinium blue, he felt only a little less than comfortable again.</p>

  <p>As the air grew warmer the others wakened, and he suggested carrying the
  pilot into the open, where the sharp dry air and the sunlight might help to
  revive him. This was done, and they began a second and pleasanter vigil.
  Eventually the man opened his eyes and began to speak convulsively. His four
  passengers stooped over him, listening intently to sounds that were
  meaningless except to Conway, who occasionally made answers. After some time
  the man became weaker, talked with increasing difficulty, and finally died.
  That was about mid-morning.</p>

  <p>Conway then turned to his companions. "I'm sorry to say he told me very
  little&mdash;little, I mean, compared with what we should like to know.
  Merely that we are in Tibet, which is obvious. He didn't give any coherent
  account of why he had brought us here, but he seemed to know the locality. He
  spoke a kind of Chinese that I don't understand very well, but I think he
  said something about a lamasery near here, along the valley, I gathered,
  where we could get food and shelter. Shangri-La, he called it. La is Tibetan
  for mountain pass. He was most emphatic that we should go there."</p>

  <p>"Which doesn't seem to me any reason at all why we should," said
  Mallinson. "After all, he was probably off his head. Wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"You know as much about that as I do. But if we don't go to this place,
  where else are we to go?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere you like, I don't care. All I'm certain of is that this
  Shangri-La, if it's in that direction, must be a few extra miles from
  civilization. I should feel happier if we were lessening the distance, not
  increasing it. Damnation, man, aren't you going to get us back?"</p>

  <p>Conway replied patiently: "I don't think you properly understand the
  position, Mallinson. We're in a part of the world that no one knows very much
  about, except that it's difficult and dangerous even for a fully equipped
  expedition. Considering that hundreds of miles of this sort of country
  probably surround us on all sides, the notion of walking back to Peshawar
  doesn't strike me as very hopeful."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I could possibly manage it," said Miss Brinklow
  seriously.</p>

  <p>Barnard nodded. "It looks as if we're darned lucky, then, if this lamasery
  IS just around the corner."</p>

  <p>"Comparatively lucky, maybe," agreed Conway. "After all, we've no food,
  and as you can see for yourselves, the country isn't the kind it would be
  easy to live on. In a few hours we shall all be famished. And then tonight,
  if we were to stay here, we should have to face the wind and the cold again.
  It's not a pleasant prospect. Our only chance, it seems to me, is to find
  some other human beings, and where else should we begin looking for them
  except where we've been told they exist?"</p>

  <p>"And what if it's a trap?" asked Mallinson, but Barnard supplied an
  answer. "A nice warm trap," he said, "with a piece of cheese in it, would
  suit me down to the ground."</p>

  <p>They laughed, except Mallinson, who looked distraught and nerve-racked.
  Finally Conway went on: "I take it, then, that we're all more or less agreed?
  There's an obvious way along the valley; it doesn't look too steep, though we
  shall have to take it slowly. In any case, we could do nothing here. We
  couldn't even bury this man without dynamite. Besides, the lamasery people
  may be able to supply us with porters for the journey back. We shall need
  them. I suggest we start at once, so that if we don't locate the place by
  late afternoon we shall have time to return for another night in the
  cabin."</p>

  <p>"And supposing we DO locate it?" queried Mallinson, still intransigent.
  "Have we any guarantee that we shan't be murdered?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. But I think it is a less, and perhaps also a preferable risk
  to being starved or frozen to death." He added, feeling that such chilly
  logic might not be entirely suited for the occasion: "As a matter of fact,
  murder is the very last thing one would expect in a Buddhist monastery. It
  would be rather less likely than being killed in an English cathedral."</p>

  <p>"Like Saint Thomas of Canterbury," said Miss Brinklow, nodding an emphatic
  agreement, but completely spoiling his point. Mallinson shrugged his
  shoulders and responded with melancholy irritation: "Very well, then, we'll
  be off to Shangri-La. Wherever and whatever it is, we'll try it. But let's
  hope it's not half-way up that mountain."</p>

  <p>The remark served to fix their glances on the glittering cone towards
  which the valley pointed. Sheerly magnificent it looked in the full light of
  day; and then their gaze turned to a stare, for they could see, far away and
  approaching them down the slope, the figures of men. "Providence!" whispered
  Miss Brinklow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Part of Conway was always an onlooker, however active might
  be the rest. Just now, while waiting for the strangers to come nearer, he
  refused to be fussed into deciding what he might or mightn't do in any number
  of possible contingencies. And this was not bravery, or coolness, or any
  especially sublime confidence in his own power to make decisions on the spur
  of the moment. It was, if the worst view be taken, a form of indolence, an
  unwillingness to interrupt his mere spectator's interest in what was
  happening.</p>

  <p>As the figures moved down the valley they revealed themselves to be a
  party of a dozen or more, carrying with them a hooded chair. In this, a
  little later, could be discerned a person robed in blue. Conway could not
  imagine where they were all going, but it certainly seemed providential, as
  Miss Brinklow had said, that such a detachment should chance to be passing
  just there and then. As soon as he was within hailing distance he left his
  own party and walked ahead, though not hurriedly, for he knew that Orientals
  enjoy the ritual of meeting and like to take their time over it. Halting when
  a few yards off, he bowed with due courtesy. Much to his surprise the robed
  figure stepped from the chair, came forward with dignified deliberation, and
  held out his hand. Conway responded, and observed an old or elderly Chinese,
  gray-haired, clean-shaven, and rather pallidly decorative in a silk
  embroidered gown. He in his turn appeared to be submitting Conway to the same
  kind of reckoning. Then, in precise and perhaps too accurate English, he
  said: "I am from the lamasery of Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>Conway bowed again, and after a suitable pause began to explain briefly
  the circumstances that had brought him and his three companions to such an
  unfrequented part of the world. At the end of the recital the Chinese made a
  gesture of understanding. "It is indeed remarkable," he said, and gazed
  reflectively at the damaged aeroplane. Then he added: "My name is Chang, if
  you would be so good as to present me to your friends."</p>

  <p>Conway managed to smile urbanely. He was rather taken with this latest
  phenomenon, a Chinese who spoke perfect English and observed the social
  formalities of Bond Street amidst the wilds of Tibet. He turned to the
  others, who had by this time caught up and were regarding the encounter with
  varying degrees of astonishment. "Miss Brinklow... Mr. Barnard, who is an
  American... Mr. Mallinson... and my own name is Conway. We are all glad to
  see you, though the meeting is almost as puzzling as the fact of our being
  here at all. Indeed, we were just about to make our way to your lamasery, so
  it is doubly fortunate. If you could give us directions for the journey
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no need for that. I shall be delighted to act as your
  guide."</p>

  <p>"But I could not think of putting you to such trouble. It is exceedingly
  kind of you, but if the distance is not far&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not far, but it is not easy, either. I shall esteem it an honor to
  accompany you and your friends."</p>

  <p>"But really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must insist."</p>

  <p>Conway thought that the argument, in its context of place and
  circumstance, was in some danger of becoming ludicrous. "Very well," he
  responded. "I'm sure we are all most obliged."</p>

  <p>Mallinson, who had been somberly enduring these pleasantries, now
  interposed with something of the shrill acerbity of the barrack square. "Our
  stay won't be long," he announced curtly. "We shall pay for anything we have,
  and we should like to hire some of your men to help us on our journey back.
  We want to return to civilization as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"And are you so very certain that you are away from it?"</p>

  <p>The query, delivered with much suavity, only stung the youth to further
  sharpness. "I'm quite sure I'm far away from where I want to be, and so are
  we all. We shall be grateful for temporary shelter, but we shall be more
  grateful still if you'll provide means for us to return. How long do you
  suppose the journey to India will take?"</p>

  <p>"I really could not say at all."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope we're not going to have any trouble about it. I've had some
  experience of hiring native porters, and we shall expect you to use your
  influence to get us a square deal."</p>

  <p>Conway felt that most of all this was rather needlessly truculent, and he
  was just about to intervene when the reply came, still with immense dignity:
  "I can only assure you, Mr. Mallinson, that you will be honorably treated and
  that ultimately you will have no regrets."</p>

  <p>"ULTIMATELY!" Mallinson exclaimed, pouncing on the word, but there was
  greater ease in avoiding a scene since wine and fruit were now on offer,
  having been unpacked by the marching party, stocky Tibetans in sheepskins,
  fur hats, and yak-skin boots. The wine had a pleasant flavor, not unlike a
  good hock, while the fruit included mangoes, perfectly ripened and almost
  painfully delicious after so many hours of fasting. Mallinson ate and drank
  with incurious relish; but Conway, relieved of immediate worries and
  reluctant to cherish distant ones, was wondering how mangoes could be
  cultivated at such an altitude. He was also interested in the mountain beyond
  the valley; it was a sensational peak, by any standards, and he was surprised
  that some traveler had not made much of it in the kind of book that a journey
  in Tibet invariably elicits. He climbed it in mind as he gazed, choosing a
  route by col and couloir until an exclamation from Mallinson drew his
  attention back to earth; he looked round then and saw the Chinese had been
  earnestly regarding him. "You were contemplating the mountain, Mr. Conway?"
  came the enquiry.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's a fine sight. It has a name, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"It is called Karakal."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I ever heard of it. Is it very high?"</p>

  <p>"Over twenty-eight thousand feet."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? I didn't realize there would be anything on that scale outside
  the Himalayas. Has it been properly surveyed? Whose are the
  measurements?"</p>

  <p>"Whose would you expect, my dear sir? Is there anything incompatible
  between monasticism and trigonometry?"</p>

  <p>Conway savored the phrase and replied: "Oh, not at all&mdash;not at all."
  Then he laughed politely. He thought it a poorish joke, but one perhaps worth
  making the most of. Soon after that the journey to Shangri-La was begun.</p>

  <p>All morning the climb proceeded, slowly and by easy gradients; but at such
  height the physical effort was considerable, and none had energy to spare for
  talk. The Chinese traveled luxuriously in his chair, which might have seemed
  unchivalrous had it not been absurd to picture Miss Brinklow in such a regal
  setting. Conway, whom the rarefied air troubled less than the rest, was at
  pains to catch the occasional chatter of the chair-bearers. He knew a very
  little Tibetan, just enough to gather that the men were glad to be returning
  to the lamasery. He could not, even had he wished, have continued to converse
  with their leader, since the latter, with eyes closed and face half-hidden
  behind curtains, appeared to have the knack of instant and well-timed
  sleep.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sun was warm; hunger and thirst had been appeased, if not
  satisfied; and the air, clean as from another planet, was more precious with
  every intake. One had to breathe consciously and deliberately, which, though
  disconcerting at first, induced after a time an almost ecstatic tranquillity
  of mind. The whole body moved in a single rhythm of breathing, walking, and
  thinking; the lungs, no longer discrete and automatic, were disciplined to
  harmony with mind and limb. Conway, in whom a mystical strain ran in curious
  consort with skepticism, found himself not unhappily puzzled over the
  sensation. Once or twice he spoke a cheerful word to Mallinson, but the youth
  was laboring under the strain of the ascent. Barnard also gasped
  asthmatically, while Miss Brinklow was engaged in some grim pulmonary warfare
  which for some reason she made efforts to conceal. "We're nearly at the top,"
  Conway said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I once ran for a train and felt just like this," she answered.</p>

  <p>So also, Conway reflected, there were people who considered cider was just
  like champagne. It was a matter of palate.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to find that beyond his puzzlement he had few misgivings,
  and none at all on his own behalf. There were moments in life when one opened
  wide one's soul just as one might open wide one's purse if an evening's
  entertainment were proving unexpectedly costly but also unexpectedly novel.
  Conway, on that breathless morning in sight of Karakal, made just such a
  willing, relieved, yet not excited response to the offer of new experience.
  After ten years in various parts of Asia he had attained to a somewhat
  fastidious valuation of places and happenings; and this he was bound to admit
  promised unusually.</p>

  <p>About a couple of miles along the valley the ascent grew steeper, but by
  this time the sun was overclouded and a silvery mist obscured the view.
  Thunder and avalanches resounded from the snowfields above; the air took
  chill, and then, with the sudden changefulness of mountain regions, became
  bitterly cold. A flurry of wind and sleet drove up, drenching the party and
  adding immeasurably to their discomfort; even Conway felt at one moment that
  it would be impossible to go much further. But shortly afterwards it seemed
  that the summit of the ridge had been reached, for the chair-bearers halted
  to readjust their burden. The condition of Barnard and Mallinson, who were
  both suffering severely, led to continued delay; but the Tibetans were
  clearly anxious to press on, and made signs that the rest of the journey
  would be less fatiguing.</p>

  <p>After these assurances it was disappointing to see them uncoiling ropes.
  "Do they mean to hang us already?" Barnard managed to exclaim, with desperate
  facetiousness; but the guides soon showed that their less sinister intention
  was merely to link the party together in ordinary mountaineering fashion.
  When they observed that Conway was familiar with rope craft, they became much
  more respectful and allowed him to dispose the party in his own way. He put
  himself next to Mallinson, with Tibetans ahead and to the rear, and with
  Barnard and Miss Brinklow and more Tibetans further back still. He was prompt
  to notice that the men, during their leader's continuing sleep, were inclined
  to let him deputize. He felt a familiar quickening of authority; if there
  were to be any difficult business he would give what he knew was his to give
  &mdash;confidence and command. He had been a first-class mountaineer in his
  time, and was still, no doubt, pretty good. "You've got to look after
  Barnard," he told Miss Brinklow, half jocularly, half meaning it; and she
  answered with the coyness of an eagle: "I'll do my best, but you know, I've
  never been roped before."</p>

  <p>But the next stage, though occasionally exciting, was less arduous than he
  had been prepared for, and a relief from the lung-bursting strain of the
  ascent. The track consisted of a traverse cut along the flank of a rock wall
  whose height above them the mist obscured. Perhaps mercifully it also
  obscured the abyss on the other side, though Conway, who had a good eye for
  heights, would have liked to see where he was. The path was scarcely more
  than two feet wide in places, and the manner in which the bearers maneuvered
  the chair at such points drew his admiration almost as strongly as did the
  nerves of the occupant who could manage to sleep through it all. The Tibetans
  were reliable enough, but they seemed happier when the path widened and
  became slightly downhill. Then they began to sing amongst themselves, lilting
  barbaric tunes that Conway could imagine orchestrated by Massenet for some
  Tibetan ballet. The rain ceased and the air grew warmer. "Well, it's quite
  certain we could never have found our way here by ourselves," said Conway
  intending to be cheerful, but Mallinson did not find the remark very
  comforting. He was, in fact, acutely terrified, and in more danger of showing
  it now that the worst was over. "Should we be missing much?" he retorted
  bitterly. The track went on, more sharply downhill, and at one spot Conway
  found some edelweiss, the first welcome sign of more hospitable levels. But
  this, when he announced it, consoled Mallinson even less. "Good God, Conway,
  d'you fancy you're pottering about the Alps? What sort of hell's kitchen are
  we making for, that's what I'd like to know? And what's our plan of action
  when we get to it? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?"</p>

  <p>Conway said quietly, "If you'd had all the experiences I've had, you'd
  know that there are times in life when the most comfortable thing is to do
  nothing at all. Things happen to you and you just let them happen. The war
  was rather like that. One is fortunate if, as on this occasion, a touch of
  novelty seasons the unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>"You're too confoundedly philosophic for me. That wasn't your mood during
  the trouble at Baskul."</p>

  <p>"Of course not, because then there was a chance that I could alter events
  by my own actions. But now, for the moment at least, there's no such chance.
  We're here because we're here, if you want a reason. I've usually found it a
  soothing one."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you realize the appalling job we shall have to get back by the
  way we've come. We've been slithering along the face of a perpendicular
  mountain for the last hour&mdash;I've been taking notice."</p>

  <p>"So have I."</p>

  <p>"Have you?" Mallinson coughed excitedly. "I daresay I'm being a nuisance,
  but I can't help it. I'm suspicious about all this. I feel we're doing far
  too much what these fellows want us to. They're getting us into a
  corner."</p>

  <p>"Even if they are, the only alternative was to stay out of it and
  perish."</p>

  <p>"I know that's logical, but it doesn't seem to help. I'm afraid I don't
  find it as easy as you do to accept the situation. I can't forget that two
  days ago we were in the consulate at Baskul. To think of all that has
  happened since is a bit overwhelming to me. I'm sorry. I'm overwrought. It
  makes me realize how lucky I was to miss the war; I suppose I should have got
  hysterical about things. The whole world seems to have gone completely mad
  all round me. I must be pretty wild myself to be talking to you like
  this."</p>

  <p>Conway shook his head. "My dear boy, not at all. You're twenty-four years
  old, and you're somewhere about two and a half miles up in the air: those are
  reasons enough for anything you may happen to feel at the moment. I think
  you've come through a trying ordeal extraordinarily well, better than I
  should at your age."</p>

  <p>"But don't YOU feel the madness of it all? The way we flew over those
  mountains and that awful waiting in the wind and the pilot dying and then
  meeting these fellows, doesn't it all seem nightmarish and incredible when
  you look back on it?"</p>

  <p>"It does, of course."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish I knew how you manage to keep so cool about everything."</p>

  <p>"Do you really wish that? I'll tell you if you like, though you'll perhaps
  think me cynical. It's because so much else that I can look back on seems
  nightmarish too. This isn't the only mad part of the world, Mallinson. After
  all, if you MUST think of Baskul, do you remember just before we left how the
  revolutionaries were torturing their captives to get information? An ordinary
  washing mangle, quite effective, of course, but I don't think I ever saw
  anything more comically dreadful. And do you recollect the last message that
  came through before we were cut off? It was a circular from a Manchester
  textile firm asking if we knew of any trade openings in Baskul for the sale
  of corsets! Isn't that mad enough for you? Believe me, in arriving here the
  worst that can have happened is that we've exchanged one form of lunacy for
  another. And as for the war, if you'd been in it you'd have done the same as
  I did, learned how to funk with a stiff lip."</p>

  <p>They were still conversing when a sharp but brief ascent robbed them of
  breath, inducing in a few paces all their earlier strain. Presently the
  ground leveled, and they stepped out of the mist into clear, sunny air.
  Ahead, and only a short distance away, lay the lamasery of Shangri-La.</p>

  <p>To Conway, seeing it first, it might have been a vision fluttering out of
  that solitary rhythm in which lack of oxygen had encompassed all his
  faculties. It was, indeed, a strange and half-incredible sight. A group of
  colored pavilions clung to the mountainside with none of the grim
  deliberation of a Rhineland castle, but rather with the chance delicacy of
  flower petals impaled upon a crag. It was superb and exquisite. An austere
  emotion carried the eye upward from milk-blue roofs to the gray rock bastion
  above, tremendous as the Wetterhorn above Grindelwald. Beyond that, in a
  dazzling pyramid, soared the snow slopes of Karakal. It might well be, Conway
  thought, the most terrifying mountainscape in the world, and he imagined the
  immense stress of snow and glacier against which the rock functioned as a
  gigantic retaining wall. Someday, perhaps, the whole mountain would split,
  and a half of Karakal's icy splendor come toppling into the valley. He
  wondered if the slightness of the risk combined with its fearfulness might
  even be found agreeably stimulating.</p>

  <p>Hardly less an enticement was the downward prospect, for the mountain wall
  continued to drop, nearly perpendicularly, into a cleft that could only have
  been the result of some cataclysm in the far past. The floor of the valley,
  hazily distant, welcomed the eye with greenness; sheltered from winds, and
  surveyed rather than dominated by the lamasery, it looked to Conway a
  delightfully favored place, though if it were inhabited its community must be
  completely isolated by the lofty and sheerly unscalable ranges on the further
  side. Only to the lamasery did there appear to be any climbable egress at
  all. Conway experienced, as he gazed, a slight tightening of apprehension;
  Mallinson's misgivings were not, perhaps, to be wholly disregarded. But the
  feeling was only momentary, and soon merged in the deeper sensation,
  half-mystical, half-visual, of having reached at last some place that was an
  end, a finality.</p>

  <p>He never exactly remembered how he and the others arrived at the lamasery,
  or with what formalities they were received, unroped, and ushered into the
  precincts. That thin air had a dream-like texture, matching the
  porcelain-blue of the sky; with every breath and every glance he took in a
  deep anesthetizing tranquillity that made him impervious alike to Mallinson's
  uneasiness, Barnard's witticisms, and Miss Brinklow's portrayal of a lady
  well prepared for the worst. He vaguely recollected surprise at finding the
  interior spacious, well warmed, and quite clean; but there was no time to do
  more than notice these qualities, for the Chinese had left his hooded chair
  and was already leading the way through various antechambers. He was quite
  affable now. "I must apologize," he said, "for leaving you to yourselves on
  the way, but the truth is, journeys of that kind don't suit me, and I have to
  take care of myself. I trust you were not too fatigued?"</p>

  <p>"We managed," replied Conway with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. And now, if you will come with me, I will show you to your
  apartments. No doubt you would like baths. Our accommodation is simple, but I
  hope adequate."</p>

  <p>At this point Barnard, who was still affected by shortness of breath, gave
  vent to an asthmatic chuckle. "Well," he gasped, "I can't say I like your
  climate yet&mdash;the air seems to stick on my chest a bit&mdash;but you've
  certainly got a darned fine view out of your front windows. Do we all have to
  line up for the bathroom, or is this an American hotel?"</p>

  <p>"I think you will find everything quite satisfactory, Mr. Barnard."</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow nodded primly. "I should hope so, indeed."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards," continued the Chinese, "I should be greatly honored if
  you will all join me at dinner."</p>

  <p>Conway replied courteously. Only Mallinson had given no sign of his
  attitude in the face of these unlooked-for amenities. Like Barnard, he had
  been suffering from the altitude, but now, with an effort, he found breath to
  exclaim: "And afterwards, also, if you don't mind, we'll make our plans for
  getting away. The sooner the better, so far as I'm concerned."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"So you see," Chang was saying, "we are less barbarian than
  you expected..."</p>

  <p>Conway, later that evening, was not disposed to deny it. He was enjoying
  that pleasant mingling of physical ease and mental alertness which seemed to
  him, of all sensations, the most truly civilized. So far, the appointments of
  Shangri-La had been all that he could have wished, certainly more than he
  could ever have expected. That a Tibetan monastery should possess a system of
  central heating was not, perhaps, so very remarkable in an age that supplied
  even Lhasa with telephones; but that it should combine the mechanics of
  Western hygiene with so much that was Eastern and traditional, struck him as
  exceedingly singular. The bath, for instance, in which he had recently
  luxuriated, had been of a delicate green porcelain, a product, according to
  inscription, of Akron, Ohio. Yet the native attendant had valeted him in
  Chinese fashion, cleansing his ears and nostrils, and passing a thin, silk
  swab under his lower eyelids. He had wondered at the time if and how his
  three companions were receiving similar attentions.</p>

  <p>Conway had lived for nearly a decade in China, not wholly in the bigger
  cities; and he counted it, all things considered, the happiest part of his
  life. He liked the Chinese, and felt at home with Chinese ways. In particular
  he liked Chinese cooking, with its subtle undertones of taste; and his first
  meal at Shangri-La had therefore conveyed a welcome familiarity. He
  suspected, too, that it might have contained some herb or drug to relieve
  respiration, for he not only felt a difference himself, but could observe a
  greater ease among his fellow guests. Chang, he noticed, ate nothing but a
  small portion of green salad, and took no wine. "You will excuse me," he had
  explained at the outset, "but my diet is very restricted: I am obliged to
  take care of myself."</p>

  <p>It was the reason he had given before, and Conway wondered by what form of
  invalidism he was afflicted. Regarding him now more closely, he found it
  difficult to guess his age; his smallish and somehow undetailed features,
  together with the moist clay texture of his skin, gave him a look that might
  either have been that of a young man prematurely old or of an old man
  remarkably well preserved. He was by no means without attractiveness of a
  kind; a certain stylized courtesy hung about him in a fragrance too delicate
  to be detected till one had ceased to think about it. In his embroidered gown
  of blue silk, with the usual side-slashed skirt and tight-ankled trousers,
  all the hue of watercolor skies, he had a cold metallic charm which Conway
  found pleasing, though he knew it was not everybody's taste.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere, in fact, was Chinese rather than specifically Tibetan; and
  this in itself gave Conway an agreeable sensation of being at home, though
  again it was one that he could not expect the others to share. The room, too,
  pleased him; it was admirably proportioned, and sparingly adorned with
  tapestries and one or two fine pieces of lacquer. Light was from paper
  lanterns, motionless in the still air. He felt a soothing comfort of mind and
  body, and his renewed speculations as to some possible drug were hardly
  apprehensive. Whatever it was, if it existed at all, it had relieved
  Barnard's breathlessness and Mallinson's truculence; both had dined well,
  finding satisfaction in eating rather than talk. Conway also had been hungry
  enough, and was not sorry that etiquette demanded gradualness in approaching
  matters of importance. He had never cared for hurrying a situation that was
  itself enjoyable, so that the technique well suited him. Not, indeed, until
  he had begun a cigarette did he give a gentle lead to his curiosity; he
  remarked then, addressing Chang: "You seem a very fortunate community, and
  most hospitable to strangers. I don't imagine, though, that you receive them
  often."</p>

  <p>"Seldom indeed," replied the Chinese, with measured stateliness. "It is
  not a traveled part of the world."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled at that. "You put the matter mildly. It looked to me, as I
  came, the most isolated spot I ever set eyes on. A separate culture might
  flourish here without contamination from the outside world."</p>

  <p>"Contamination, would you say?"</p>

  <p>"I use the word in reference to dance bands, cinemas, electric signs, and
  so on. Your plumbing is quite rightly as modern as you can get it, the only
  certain boon, to my mind, that the East can take from the West. I often think
  that the Romans were fortunate; their civilization reached as far as hot
  baths without touching the fatal knowledge of machinery."</p>

  <p>Conway paused. He had been talking with an impromptu fluency which, though
  not insincere, was chiefly designed to create and control an atmosphere. He
  was rather good at that sort of thing. Only a willingness to respond to the
  superfine courtesy of the occasion prevented him from being more openly
  curious.</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow, however, had no such scruples. "Please," she said, though
  the word was by no means submissive, "will you tell us about the
  monastery?"</p>

  <p>Chang raised his eyebrows in very gentle deprecation of such immediacy.
  "It will give me the greatest of pleasure, madam, so far as I am able. What
  exactly do you wish to know?"</p>

  <p>"First of all, how many are there of you here, and what nationality do you
  belong to?" It was clear that her orderly mind was functioning no less
  professionally than at the Baskul mission house.</p>

  <p>Chang replied: "Those of us in full lamahood number about fifty, and there
  are a few others, like myself, who have not yet attained to complete
  initiation. We shall do so in due course, it is to be hoped. Till then we are
  half-lamas, postulants, you might say. As for our racial origins, there are
  representatives of a great many nations among us, though it is perhaps
  natural that Tibetans and Chinese make up the majority."</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow would never shirk a conclusion, even a wrong one. "I see.
  It's really a native monastery, then. Is your head lama a Tibetan or a
  Chinese?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Are there any English?"</p>

  <p>"Several."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, that seems very remarkable." Miss Brinklow paused only for
  breath before continuing: "And now, tell me what you all believe in."</p>

  <p>Conway leaned back with somewhat amused expectancy. He had always found
  pleasure in observing the impact of opposite mentalities; and Miss Brinklow's
  girl-guide forthrightness applied to Lamaistic philosophy promised to be
  entertaining. On the other hand, he did not wish his host to take fright.
  "That's rather a big question," he said, temporizingly.</p>

  <p>But Miss Brinklow was in no mood to temporize. The wine, which had made
  the others more reposeful, seemed to have given her an extra liveliness. "Of
  course," she said with a gesture of magnanimity, "I believe in the true
  religion, but I'm broad-minded enough to admit that other people, foreigners,
  I mean, are quite often sincere in their views. And naturally in a monastery
  I wouldn't expect to be agreed with."</p>

  <p>Her concession evoked a formal bow from Chang. "But why not, madam?" he
  replied in his precise and flavored English. "Must we hold that because one
  religion is true, all others are bound to be false?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, that's rather obvious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Conway again interposed. "Really, I think we had better not argue. But
  Miss Brinklow shares my own curiosity about the motive of this unique
  establishment."</p>

  <p>Chang answered rather slowly and in scarcely more than a whisper: "If I
  were to put it into a very few words, my dear sir, I should say that our
  prevalent belief is in moderation. We inculcate the virtue of avoiding excess
  of all kinds&mdash;even including, if you will pardon the paradox, excess of
  virtue itself. In the valley which you have seen, and in which there are
  several thousand inhabitants living under the control of our order, we have
  found that the principle makes for a considerable degree of happiness. We
  rule with moderate strictness, and in return we are satisfied with moderate
  obedience. And I think I can claim that our people are moderately sober,
  moderately chaste, and moderately honest."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. He thought it well expressed, besides which it made some
  appeal to his own temperament. "I think I understand. And I suppose the
  fellows who met us this morning belonged to your valley people?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I hope you had no fault to find with them during the journey?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, none at all. I'm glad they were more than moderately surefooted,
  anyhow. You were careful, by the way, to say that the rule of moderation
  applied to THEM&mdash;am I to take it that it does not apply to your
  priesthood also?"</p>

  <p>But at that Chang could only shake his head. "I regret, sir, that you have
  touched upon a matter which I may not discuss. I can only add that our
  community has various faiths and usages, but we are most of us moderately
  heretical about them. I am deeply grieved that at the moment I cannot say
  more."</p>

  <p>"Please don't apologize. I am left with the pleasantest of speculations."
  Something in his own voice, as well as in his bodily sensations, gave Conway
  a renewed impression that he had been very slightly doped. Mallinson appeared
  to have been similarly affected, though he seized the present chance to
  remark: "All this has been very interesting, but I really think it's time we
  began to discuss our plans for getting away. We want to return to India as
  soon as possible. How many porters can we be supplied with?"</p>

  <p>The question, so practical and uncompromising, broke through the crust of
  suavity to find no sure foothold beneath. Only after a longish interval came
  Chang's reply: "Unfortunately, Mr. Mallinson, I am not the proper person to
  approach. But in any case, I hardly think the matter could be arranged
  immediately."</p>

  <p>"But something has GOT to be arranged! We've all got our work to return
  to, and our friends and relatives will be worrying about us. We simply MUST
  return. We're obliged to you for receiving us like this, but we really can't
  slack about here doing nothing. If it's at all feasible, we should like to
  set out not later than tomorrow. I expect there are a good many of your
  people who would volunteer to escort us&mdash;we should make it well worth
  their while, of course."</p>

  <p>Mallinson ended nervously, as if he had hoped to be answered before saying
  so much; but he could extract from Chang no more than a quiet and almost
  reproachful: "But all this, you know, is scarcely in my province."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it? Well, perhaps you can do SOMETHING, at any rate. If you could
  get us a large-scale map of the country, it would help. It looks as if we
  shall have a long journey, and that's all the more reason for making an early
  start. You have maps, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have a great many."</p>

  <p>"We'll borrow some of them, then, if you don't mind. We can return them to
  you afterwards. I suppose you must have communications with the outer world
  from time to time. And it would be a good idea to send messages ahead, also,
  to reassure our friends. How far away is the nearest telegraph line?"</p>

  <p>Chang's wrinkled face seemed to have acquired a look of infinite patience,
  but he did not reply.</p>

  <p>Mallinson waited a moment and then continued: "Well, where do you send to
  when you want anything? Anything civilized, I mean." A touch of scaredness
  began to appear in his eyes and voice. Suddenly he thrust back his chair and
  stood up. He was pale, and passed his hand wearily across his forehead. "I'm
  so tired," he stammered, glancing round the room. "I don't feel that any of
  you are really trying to help me. I'm only asking a simple question. It's
  obvious you must know the answer to it. When you had all these modern baths
  installed, how did they get here?"</p>

  <p>There followed another silence.</p>

  <p>"You won't tell me, then? It's part of the mystery of everything else, I
  suppose. Conway, I must say I think you're damned slack. Why don't YOU get at
  the truth? I'm all in, for the time being&mdash;but&mdash;tomorrow, mind
  &mdash;we MUST get away tomorrow&mdash;it's essential&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He would have slid to the floor had not Conway caught him and helped him
  to a chair. Then he recovered a little, but did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow he will be much better," said Chang gently. "The air here is
  difficult for the stranger at first, but one soon becomes acclimatized."</p>

  <p>Conway felt himself waking from a trance. "Things have been a little
  trying for him," he commented with rather rueful mildness. He added, more
  briskly: "I expect we're all feeling it somewhat. I think we'd better adjourn
  this discussion and go to bed. Barnard, will you look after Mallinson? And
  I'm sure YOU'RE in need of sleep too, Miss Brinklow." There had been some
  signal given, for at that moment a servant appeared. "Yes, we'll get along
  &mdash;good night&mdash;good night&mdash;I shall soon follow." He almost
  pushed them out of the room, and then, with a scantness of ceremony that was
  in marked contrast with his earlier manner, turned to his host. Mallinson's
  reproach had spurred him.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir, I don't want to detain you long, so I'd better come to the
  point. My friend is impetuous, but I don't blame him, he's quite right to
  make things clear. Our return journey has to be arranged, and we can't do it
  without help from you or from others in this place. Of course, I realize that
  leaving tomorrow is impossible, and for my own part I hope to find a minimum
  stay quite interesting. But that, perhaps, is not the attitude of my
  companions. So if it's true, as you say, that you can do nothing for us
  yourself, please put us in touch with someone else who can."</p>

  <p>The Chinese answered: "You are wiser than your friends, my dear sir, and
  therefore you are less impatient. I am glad."</p>

  <p>"That's not an answer."</p>

  <p>Chang began to laugh, a jerky high-pitched chuckle so obviously forced
  that Conway recognized in it the polite pretense of seeing an imaginary joke
  with which the Chinese "saves face" at awkward moments. "I feel sure you have
  no cause to worry about the matter," came the reply, after an interval. "No
  doubt in due course we shall be able to give you all the help you need. There
  are difficulties, as you can imagine, but if we all approach the problem
  sensibly, and without undue haste&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not suggesting haste. I'm merely seeking information about
  porters."</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear sir, that raises another point. I very much doubt whether
  you will easily find men willing to undertake such a journey. They have their
  homes in the valley, and they don't care for leaving them to make long and
  arduous trips outside."</p>

  <p>"They can be prevailed upon to do so, though, or else why and where were
  they escorting you this morning?"</p>

  <p>"This morning? Oh, that was quite a different matter."</p>

  <p>"In what way? Weren't you setting out on a journey when I and my friends
  chanced to come across you?"</p>

  <p>There was no response to this, and presently Conway continued in a quieter
  voice: "I understand. Then it was not a chance meeting. I had wondered all
  along, in fact. So you came there deliberately to intercept us. That suggests
  you must have known of our arrival beforehand. And the interesting question
  is, HOW?"</p>

  <p>His words laid a note of stress amidst the exquisite quietude of the
  scene. The lantern light showed up the face of the Chinese; it was calm and
  statuesque. Suddenly, with a small gesture of the hand, Chang broke the
  strain; pulling aside a silken tapestry, he undraped a window leading to a
  balcony. Then, with a touch upon Conway's arm, he led him into the cold
  crystal air. "You are clever," he said dreamily, "but not entirely correct.
  For that reason I should counsel you not to worry your friends by these
  abstract discussions. Believe me, neither you nor they are in any danger at
  Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>"But it isn't danger we're bothering about. It's delay."</p>

  <p>"I realize that. And of course there MAY be a certain delay, quite
  unavoidably."</p>

  <p>"If it's only for a short time, and genuinely unavoidable, then naturally
  we shall have to put up with it as best we can."</p>

  <p>"How very sensible, for we desire nothing more than that you and your
  companions should enjoy your stay here."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well, and as I told you, in a personal sense I can't say
  I shall mind a great deal. It's a new and interesting experience, and in any
  case, we need some rest."</p>

  <p>He was gazing upward to the gleaming pyramid of Karakal. At that moment,
  in bright moonlight, it seemed as if a hand reached high might just touch it;
  it was so brittle-clear against the blue immensity beyond.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," said Chang, "you may find it even more interesting. And as for
  rest, if you are fatigued, there are not many better places in the
  world."</p>

  <p>Indeed, as Conway continued to gaze, a deeper repose overspread him, as if
  the spectacle were as much for the mind as for the eye. There was hardly any
  stir of wind, in contrast to the upland gales that had raged the night
  before; the whole valley, he perceived, was a landlocked harbor, with Karakal
  brooding over it, lighthouse-fashion. The smile grew as he considered it, for
  there was actually light on the summit, an ice-blue gleam that matched the
  splendor it reflected. Something prompted him then to enquire the literal
  interpretation of the name, and Chang's answer came as a whispered echo of
  his own musing. "Karakal, in the valley patois, means Blue Moon," said the
  Chinese.</p>

  <p>Conway did not pass on his conclusion that the arrival of himself and
  party at Shangri-La had been in some way expected by its inhabitants. He had
  had it in mind that he must do so, and he was aware that the matter was
  important; but when morning came his awareness troubled him so little, in any
  but a theoretical sense, that he shrank from being the cause of greater
  concern in others. One part of him insisted that there was something
  distinctly queer about the place, that the attitude of Chang on the previous
  evening had been far from reassuring, and that the party were virtually
  prisoners unless and until the authorities chose to do more for them. And it
  was clearly his duty to compel them to do this. After all, he was a
  representative of the British government, if nothing else; it was iniquitous
  that the inmates of a Tibetan monastery should refuse him any proper
  request... That, no doubt, was the normal official view that would be taken;
  and part of Conway was both normal and official. No one could better play the
  strongman on occasions; during those final difficult days before the
  evacuation he had behaved in a manner which (he reflected wryly) should earn
  him nothing less than a knighthood and a Henty school prize novel entitled
  With Conway at Baskul. To have taken on himself the leadership of some scores
  of mixed civilians, including women and children, to have sheltered them all
  in a small consulate during a hot-blooded revolution led by anti-foreign
  agitators, and to have bullied and cajoled the revolutionaries into
  permitting a wholesale evacuation by air, it was not, he felt, a bad
  achievement. Perhaps by pulling wires and writing interminable reports, he
  could wangle something out of it in the next New Year Honors. At any rate it
  had won him Mallinson's fervent admiration. Unfortunately, the youth must now
  be finding him so much more of a disappointment. It was a pity, of course,
  but Conway had grown used to people liking him only because they
  misunderstood him. He was not genuinely one of those resolute, strong-jawed,
  hammer-and-tongs empire builders; the semblance he had given was merely a
  little one-act play, repeated from time to time by arrangement with fate and
  the foreign office, and for a salary which anyone could turn up in the pages
  of Whitaker.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the puzzle of Shangri-La, and of his own arrival there, was
  beginning to exercise over him a rather charming fascination. In any case he
  found it hard to feel any personal misgivings. His official job was always
  liable to take him into odd parts of the world, and the odder they were, the
  less, as a rule, he suffered from boredom; why, then, grumble because
  accident instead of a chit from Whitehall had sent him to this oddest place
  of all?</p>

  <p>He was, in fact, very far from grumbling. When he rose in the morning and
  saw the soft lapis blue of the sky through his window, he would not have
  chosen to be elsewhere on earth either in Peshawar or Piccadilly. He was glad
  to find that on the others, also, a night's repose had had a heartening
  effect. Barnard was able to joke quite cheerfully about beds, baths,
  breakfasts, and other hospitable amenities. Miss Brinklow admitted that the
  most strenuous search of her apartment had failed to reveal any of the
  drawbacks she had been well prepared for. Even Mallinson had acquired a touch
  of half-sulky complacency. "I suppose we shan't get away today after all," he
  muttered, "unless somebody looks pretty sharp about it. Those fellows are
  typically Oriental, you can't get them to do anything quickly and
  efficiently."</p>

  <p>Conway accepted the remark. Mallinson had been out of England just under a
  year; long enough, no doubt, to justify a generalization which he would
  probably still repeat when he had been out for twenty. And it was true, of
  course, in some degree. Yet to Conway it did not appear that the Eastern
  races were abnormally dilatory, but rather that Englishmen and Americans
  charged about the world in a state of continual and rather preposterous fever
  heat. It was a point of view that he hardly expected any fellow Westerner to
  share, but he was more faithful to it as he grew older in years and
  experience. On the other hand, it was true enough that Chang was a subtle
  quibbler and that there was much justification for Mallinson's impatience.
  Conway had a slight wish that he could feel impatient too; it would have been
  so much easier for the boy.</p>

  <p>He said: "I think we'd better wait and see what today brings. It was
  perhaps too optimistic to expect them to do anything last night."</p>

  <p>Mallinson looked up sharply. "I suppose you think I made a fool of myself,
  being so urgent? I couldn't help it; I thought that Chinese fellow was damned
  fishy, and I do still. Did you succeed in getting any sense out of him after
  I'd gone to bed?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't stay talking long. He was rather vague and noncommittal about
  most things."</p>

  <p>"We shall jolly well have to keep him up to scratch today."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," agreed Conway, without marked enthusiasm for the prospect.
  "Meanwhile this is an excellent breakfast." It consisted of pomelo, tea, and
  chupatties, perfectly prepared and served. Towards the finish of the meal
  Chang entered and with a little bow began the exchange of politely
  conventional greetings which, in the English language, sounded just a trifle
  unwieldy. Conway would have preferred to talk in Chinese, but so far he had
  not let it be known that he spoke any Eastern tongue; he felt it might be a
  useful card up his sleeve. He listened gravely to Chang's courtesies, and
  gave assurances that he had slept well and felt much better. Chang expressed
  his pleasure at that, and added: "Truly, as your national poet says, 'Sleep
  knits up the raveled sleeve of care.'"</p>

  <p>This display of erudition was not too well received. Mallinson answered
  with that touch of scorn which any healthy-minded young Englishman must feel
  at the mention of poetry. "I suppose you mean Shakespeare, though I don't
  recognize the quotation. But I know another one that says 'Stand not upon the
  order of your going, but go at once.' Without being impolite, that's rather
  what we should all like to do. And I want to hunt round for those porters
  right away, this morning, if you've no objection."</p>

  <p>The Chinese received the ultimatum impassively, replying at length: "I am
  sorry to tell you that it would be of little use. I fear we have no men
  available who would be willing to accompany you so far from their homes."</p>

  <p>"But good God, man, you don't suppose we're going to take that for an
  answer, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I am sincerely regretful, but I can suggest no other."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have figgered it all out since last night," put in Barnard.
  "You weren't nearly so dead sure of things then."</p>

  <p>"I did not wish to disappoint you when you were so tired from your
  journey. Now, after a refreshing night, I am in hope that you will see
  matters in a more reasonable light."</p>

  <p>"Look here," intervened Conway briskly, "this sort of vagueness and
  prevarication won't do. You know we can't stay here indefinitely. It's
  equally obvious that we can't get away by ourselves. What, then, do you
  propose?"</p>

  <p>Chang smiled with a radiance that was clearly for Conway alone. "My dear
  sir, it is a pleasure to make the suggestion that is in my mind. To your
  friend's attitude there was no answer, but to the demand of a wise man there
  is always a response. You may recollect that it was remarked yesterday, again
  by your friend, I believe, that we are bound to have occasional communication
  with the outside world. That is quite true. From time to time we require
  certain things from distant entrepôts, and it is our habit to obtain them in
  due course, by what methods and with what formalities I need not trouble you.
  The point of importance is that such a consignment is expected to arrive
  shortly, and as the men who make delivery will afterwards return, it seems to
  me that you might manage to come to some arrangement with them. Indeed I
  cannot think of a better plan, and I hope, when they arrive&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"When DO they arrive?" interrupted Mallinson bluntly.</p>

  <p>"The exact date is, of course, impossible to forecast. You have yourself
  had the experience of the difficulty of movement in this part of the world. A
  hundred things may happen to cause uncertainty, hazards of
  weather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Conway again intervened. "Let's get this clear. You're suggesting that we
  should employ as porters the men who are shortly due here with some goods.
  That's not a bad idea as far as it goes, but we must know a little more about
  it. First, as you've already been asked, when are these people expected? And
  second, where will they take us?"</p>

  <p>"That is a question you would have to put to them."</p>

  <p>"Would they take us to India?"</p>

  <p>"It is hardly possible for me to say."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's have an answer to the other question. When will they be here?
  I don't ask for a date, I just want some idea whether it's likely to be next
  week or next year."</p>

  <p>"It might be about a month from now. Probably not more than two
  months."</p>

  <p>"Or three, four, or five months," broke in Mallinson hotly. "And you think
  we're going to wait here for this convoy or caravan or whatever it is to take
  us God knows where at some completely vague time in the distant future?"</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, the phrase 'distant future' is hardly appropriate. Unless
  something unforeseen occurs, the period of waiting should not be longer than
  I have said."</p>

  <p>"But TWO MONTHS! Two months in this place! It's preposterous! Conway, you
  surely can't contemplate it! Why, two weeks would be the limit!"</p>

  <p>Chang gathered his gown about him in a little gesture of finality. "I am
  sorry. I did not wish to offend. The lamasery continues to offer all of you
  its utmost hospitality for as long as you have the misfortune to remain. I
  can say no more."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to," retorted Mallinson furiously. "And if you think
  you've got the whip hand over us, you'll soon find you're damn well mistaken!
  We'll get all the porters we want, don't worry. You can bow and scrape and
  say what you like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Conway laid a restraining hand on his arm. Mallinson in a temper presented
  a child-like spectacle; he was apt to say anything that came into his head,
  regardless alike of point and decorum. Conway thought it readily forgivable
  in one so constituted and circumstanced, but he feared it might affront the
  more delicate susceptibilities of a Chinese. Fortunately Chang had ushered
  himself out, with admirable tact, in good time to escape the worst.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They spent the rest of the morning discussing the matter. It
  was certainly a shock for four persons who in the ordinary course should have
  been luxuriating in the clubs and mission houses of Peshawar to find
  themselves faced instead with the prospect of two months in a Tibetan
  monastery. But it was in the nature of things that the initial shock of their
  arrival should have left them with slender reserves either of indignation or
  astonishment; even Mallinson, after his first outburst, subsided into a mood
  of half-bewildered fatalism. "I'm past arguing about it, Conway," he said,
  puffing at a cigarette with nervous irritability. "You know how I feel. I've
  said all along that there's something queer about this business. It's
  crooked. I'd like to be out of it this minute."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you for that," replied Conway. "Unfortunately, it's not a
  question of what any of us would like, but of what we've all got to put up
  with. Frankly, if these people say they won't or can't supply us with the
  necessary porters, there's nothing for it but to wait till the other fellows
  come. I'm sorry to admit that we're so helpless in the matter, but I'm afraid
  it's the truth."</p>

  <p>"You mean we've got to stay here for two months?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what else we can do."</p>

  <p>Mallinson flicked his cigarette ash with a gesture of forced nonchalance.
  "All right, then. Two months it is. And now let's all shout hooray about
  it."</p>

  <p>Conway went on: "I don't see why it should be much worse than two months
  in any other isolated part of the world. People in our jobs are used to being
  sent to odd places, I think I can say that of us all. Of course, it's bad for
  those of us who have friends and relatives. Personally, I'm fortunate in that
  respect, I can't think of anyone who'll worry over me acutely, and my work,
  whatever it might have been, can easily be done by somebody else."</p>

  <p>He turned to the others as if inviting them to state their own cases.
  Mallinson proffered no information, but Conway knew roughly how he was
  situated. He had parents and a girl in England; it made things hard.</p>

  <p>Barnard, on the other hand, accepted the position with what Conway had
  learned to regard as an habitual good humor. "Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky,
  for that matter, two months in the penitentiary won't kill me. As for the
  folks in my hometown, they won't bat an eye. I've always been a bad letter
  writer."</p>

  <p>"You forget that our names will be in the papers," Conway reminded him.
  "We shall all be posted missing, and people will naturally assume the
  worst."</p>

  <p>Barnard looked startled for the moment; then he replied, with a slight
  grin: "Oh, yes, that's true, but it don't affect me, I assure you."</p>

  <p>Conway was glad it didn't, though the matter remained a little puzzling.
  He turned to Miss Brinklow, who till then had been remarkably silent; she had
  not offered any opinion during the interview with Chang. He imagined that she
  too might have comparatively few personal worries. She said brightly: "As Mr.
  Barnard says, two months here is nothing to make a fuss about. It's all the
  same, wherever one is, when one's in the Lord's service. Providence has sent
  me here. I regard it as a call."</p>

  <p>Conway thought the attitude a very convenient one, in the circumstances.
  "I'm sure," he said encouragingly, "you'll find your mission society pleased
  with you when you DO return. You'll be able to give much useful information.
  We'll all of us have had an experience, for that matter. That should be a
  small consolation."</p>

  <p>The talk then became general. Conway was rather surprised at the ease with
  which Barnard and Miss Brinklow had accommodated themselves to the new
  prospect. He was relieved, however, as well; it left him with only one
  disgruntled person to deal with. Yet even Mallinson, after the strain of all
  the arguing, was experiencing a reaction; he was still perturbed, but more
  willing to look at the brighter side of things. "Heaven knows what we shall
  find to do with ourselves," he exclaimed, but the mere fact of making such a
  remark showed that he was trying to reconcile himself.</p>

  <p>"The first rule must be to avoid getting on each other's nerves," replied
  Conway. "Happily, the place seems big enough, and by no means overpopulated.
  Except for servants, we've only seen one of its inhabitants so far."</p>

  <p>Barnard could find another reason for optimism. "We won't starve, at any
  rate, if our meals up to now are a fair sample. You know, Conway, this place
  isn't run without plenty of hard cash. Those baths, for instance, they cost
  real money. And I can't see that anybody earns anything here, unless those
  chaps in the valley have jobs, and even then, they wouldn't produce enough
  for export. I'd like to know if they work any minerals."</p>

  <p>"The whole place is a confounded mystery," responded Mallinson. "I daresay
  they've got pots of money hidden away, like the Jesuits. As for the baths,
  probably some millionaire supporter presented them. Anyhow, it won't worry
  me, once I get away. I must say, though, the view IS rather good, in its way.
  Fine winter sport center if it were in the right spot. I wonder if one could
  get any skiing on some of those slopes up yonder?"</p>

  <p>Conway gave him a searching and slightly amused glance. "Yesterday, when I
  found some edelweiss, you reminded me that I wasn't in the Alps. I think it's
  my turn to say the same thing now. I wouldn't advise you to try any of your
  Wengen-Scheidegg tricks in this part of the world."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose anybody here has ever seen a ski jump."</p>

  <p>"Or even an ice-hockey match," responded Conway banteringly. "You might
  try to raise some teams. What about 'Gentlemen v. Lamas'?"</p>

  <p>"It would certainly teach them to play the game," Miss Brinklow put in
  with sparkling seriousness.</p>

  <p>Adequate comment upon this might have been difficult, but there was no
  necessity, since lunch was about to be served and its character and
  promptness combined to make an agreeable impression. Afterwards, when Chang
  entered, there was small disposition to continue the squabble. With great
  tactfulness the Chinese assumed that he was still on good terms with
  everybody, and the four exiles allowed the assumption to stand. Indeed, when
  he suggested that they might care to be shown a little more of the lamasery
  buildings, and that if so, he would be pleased to act as guide, the offer was
  readily accepted. "Why, surely," said Barnard. "We may as well give the place
  the once-over while we're here. I reckon it'll be a long time before any of
  us pay a second visit."</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow struck a more thought-giving note. "When we left Baskul in
  that aeroplane I'm sure I never dreamed we should ever get to a place like
  this," she murmured as they all moved off under Chang's escort.</p>

  <p>"And we don't know yet why we have," answered Mallinson unforgetfully.</p>

  <p>Conway had no race or color prejudice, and it was an affectation for him
  to pretend, as he sometimes did in clubs and first-class railway carriages,
  that he set any particular store on the "whiteness" of a lobster-red face
  under a topee. It saved trouble to let it be so assumed, especially in India,
  and Conway was a conscientious trouble-saver. But in China it had been less
  necessary; he had had many Chinese friends, and it had never occurred to him
  to treat them as inferiors. Hence, in his intercourse with Chang, he was
  sufficiently unpreoccupied to see in him a mannered old gentleman who might
  not be entirely trustworthy, but who was certainly of high intelligence.
  Mallinson, on the other hand, tended to regard him through the bars of an
  imaginary cage; Miss Brinklow was sharp and sprightly, as with the heathen in
  his blindness; while Barnard's wise-cracking bonhomie was of the kind he
  would have cultivated with a butler.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the grand tour of Shangri-La was interesting enough to transcend
  these attitudes. It was not the first monastic institution Conway had
  inspected, but it was easily the largest and, apart from its situation, the
  most remarkable. The mere procession through rooms and courtyards was an
  afternoon's exercise, though he was aware of many apartments passed by,
  indeed, of whole buildings into which Chang did not offer admission. The
  party were shown enough, however, to confirm the impressions each one of them
  had formed already. Barnard was more certain than ever that the lamas were
  rich; Miss Brinklow discovered abundant evidence that they were immoral.
  Mallinson, after the first novelty had worn off, found himself no less
  fatigued than on many sight-seeing excursions at lower altitudes; the lamas,
  he feared, were not likely to be his heroes.</p>

  <p>Conway alone submitted to a rich and growing enchantment. It was not so
  much any individual thing that attracted him as the gradual revelation of
  elegance, of modest and impeccable taste, of harmony so fragrant that it
  seemed to gratify the eye without arresting it. Only indeed by a conscious
  effort did he recall himself from the artist's mood to the connoisseur's, and
  then he recognized treasures that museums and millionaires alike would have
  bargained for, exquisite pearl-blue Sung ceramics, paintings in tinted inks
  preserved for more than a thousand years, lacquers in which the cold and
  lovely detail of fairyland was not so much depicted as orchestrated. A world
  of incomparable refinements still lingered tremulously in porcelain and
  varnish, yielding an instant of emotion before its dissolution into purest
  thought. There was no boastfulness, no striving after effect, no concentrated
  attack upon the feelings of the beholder. These delicate perfections had an
  air of having fluttered into existence like petals from a flower. They would
  have maddened a collector, but Conway did not collect; he lacked both money
  and the acquisitive instinct. His liking for Chinese art was an affair of the
  mind; in a world of increasing noise and hugeness, he turned in private to
  gentle, precise, and miniature things. And as he passed through room after
  room, a certain pathos touched him remotely at the thought of Karakal's piled
  immensity over against such fragile charms.</p>

  <p>The lamasery, however, had more to offer than a display of Chinoiserie.
  One of its features, for instance, was a very delightful library, lofty and
  spacious, and containing a multitude of books so retiringly housed in bays
  and alcoves that the whole atmosphere was more of wisdom than of learning, of
  good manners rather than seriousness. Conway, during a rapid glance at some
  of the shelves, found much to astonish him; the world's best literature was
  there, it seemed, as well as a great deal of abstruse and curious stuff that
  he could not appraise. Volumes in English, French, German, and Russian
  abounded, and there were vast quantities of Chinese and other Eastern
  scripts. A section which interested him particularly was devoted to
  Tibetiana, if it might be so called; he noticed several rarities, among them
  the Novo Descubrimento de grao catayo ou dos Regos de Tibet, by Antonio de
  Andrada (Lisbon, 1626); Athanasius Kircher's China (Antwerp, 1667);
  Thevenot's Voyage à la Chine des Pères Grueber et d'Orville; and Beligatti's
  Relazione Inedita di un Viaggio al Tibet. He was examining the last named
  when he noticed Chang's eyes fixed on him in suave curiosity. "You are a
  scholar, perhaps?" came the enquiry.</p>

  <p>Conway found it hard to reply. His period of donhood at Oxford gave him
  some right to assent, but he knew that the word, though the highest of
  compliments from a Chinese, had yet a faintly priggish sound for English
  ears, and chiefly out of consideration for his companions he demurred to it.
  He said: "I enjoy reading, of course, but my work during recent years hasn't
  supplied many opportunities for the studious life."</p>

  <p>"Yet you wish for it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say all that, but I'm certainly aware of its
  attractions."</p>

  <p>Mallinson, who had picked up a book, interrupted: "Here's something for
  your studious life, Conway. It's a map of the country."</p>

  <p>"We have a collection of several hundreds," said Chang. "They are all open
  to your inspection, but perhaps I can save you trouble in one respect. You
  will not find Shangri-La marked on any."</p>

  <p>"Curious," Conway made comment. "I wonder why?"</p>

  <p>"There is a very good reason, but I am afraid that is all I can say."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled, but Mallinson looked peevish again. "Still piling up the
  mystery," he said. "So far we haven't seen much that anyone need bother to
  conceal."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Miss Brinklow came to life out of a mute preoccupation. "Aren't
  you going to show us the lamas at work?" she fluted, in the tone which one
  felt had intimidated many a Cook's man. One felt, too, that her mind was
  probably full of hazy visions of native handicrafts, prayer-mat weaving, or
  something picturesquely primitive that she could talk about when she got
  home. She had an extraordinary knack of never seeming very much surprised,
  yet of always seeming very slightly indignant, a combination of fixities
  which was not in the least disturbed by Chang's response: "I am sorry to say
  it is impossible. The lamas are never, or perhaps I should say only very
  rarely, seen by those outside the lamahood."</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll have to miss 'em then," agreed Barnard. "But I do think
  it's a real pity. You've no notion how much I'd like to have shaken the hand
  of your head man."</p>

  <p>Chang acknowledged the remark with benign seriousness. Miss Brinklow,
  however, was not yet to be sidetracked. "What do the lamas do?" she
  continued.</p>

  <p>"They devote themselves, madam, to contemplation and to the pursuit of
  wisdom."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't DOING anything."</p>

  <p>"Then, madam, they do nothing."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much." She found occasion to sum up. "Well, Mr. Chang, it's
  a pleasure being shown all these things, I'm sure, but you won't convince me
  that a place like this does any real good. I prefer something more
  practical."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to take tea?"</p>

  <p>Conway wondered at first if this were intended ironically, but it soon
  appeared not; the afternoon had passed swiftly, and Chang, though frugal in
  eating, had the typical Chinese fondness for tea-drinking at frequent
  intervals. Miss Brinklow, too, confessed that visiting art galleries and
  museums always gave her a touch of headache. The party, therefore, fell in
  with the suggestion, and followed Chang through several courtyards to a scene
  of quite sudden and unmatched loveliness. From a colonnade steps descended to
  a garden, in which a lotus pool lay entrapped, the leaves so closely set that
  they gave an impression of a floor of moist green tiles. Fringing the pool
  were posed a brazen menagerie of lions, dragons, and unicorns, each offering
  a stylized ferocity that emphasized rather than offended the surrounding
  peace. The whole picture was so perfectly proportioned that the eye was
  entirely unhastened from one part to another; there was no vying or vanity,
  and even the summit of Karakal, peerless above the blue-tiled roofs, seemed
  to have surrendered within the framework of an exquisite artistry. "Pretty
  little place," commented Barnard, as Chang led the way into an open pavilion
  which, to Conway's further delight, contained a harpsichord and a modern
  grand piano. He found this in some ways the crowning astonishment of a rather
  astonishing afternoon. Chang answered all his questions with complete candor
  up to a point; the lamas, he explained, held Western music in high esteem,
  particularly that of Mozart; they had a collection of all the great European
  compositions, and some were skilled performers on various instruments.</p>

  <p>Barnard was chiefly impressed by the transport problem. "D'you mean to
  tell me that this pi-anno was brought here by the route we came along
  yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"There is no other."</p>

  <p>"Well, that certainly beats everything! Why, with a phonograph and a radio
  you'd be all fixed complete! Perhaps, though, you aren't yet acquainted with
  up-to-date music?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, we have had reports, but we are advised that the mountains would
  make wireless reception impossible, and as for a phonograph, the suggestion
  has already come before the authorities, but they have felt no need to hurry
  in the matter."</p>

  <p>"I'd believe that even if you hadn't told me," Barnard retorted. "I guess
  that must be the slogan of your society, 'No hurry.'" He laughed loudly and
  then went on: "Well, to come down to details, suppose in due course your
  bosses decide that they DO want a phonograph, what's the procedure? The
  makers wouldn't deliver here, that's a sure thing. You must have an agent in
  Pekin or Shanghai or somewhere, and I'll bet everything costs plenty by the
  time you handle it."</p>

  <p>But Chang was no more to be drawn than on a previous occasion. "Your
  surmises are intelligent, Mr. Barnard, but I fear I cannot discuss them."</p>

  <p>So there they were again, Conway reflected, edging the invisible
  borderline between what might and might not be revealed. He thought he could
  soon begin to map out that line in imagination, though the impact of a new
  surprise deferred the matter. For servants were already bringing in the
  shallow bowls of scented tea, and along with the agile, lithe-limbed Tibetans
  there had also entered, quite inconspicuously, a girl in Chinese dress. She
  went directly to the harpsichord and began to play a gavotte by Rameau. The
  first bewitching twang stirred in Conway a pleasure that was beyond
  amazement; those silvery airs of eighteenth-century France seemed to match in
  elegance the Sung vases and exquisite lacquers and the lotus pool beyond; the
  same death-defying fragrance hung about them, lending immortality through an
  age to which their spirit was alien. Then he noticed the player. She had the
  long, slender nose, high cheekbones, and eggshell pallor of the Manchu; her
  black hair was drawn tightly back and braided; she looked very finished and
  miniature. Her mouth was like a little pink convolvulus, and she was quite
  still, except for her long-fingered hands. As soon as the gavotte was ended,
  she made a little obeisance and went out.</p>

  <p>Chang smiled after her and then, with a touch of personal triumph, upon
  Conway. "You are pleased?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" asked Mallinson, before Conway could reply.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Lo-Tsen. She has much skill with Western keyboard music. Like
  myself, she has not yet attained the full initiation."</p>

  <p>"I should think not, indeed!" exclaimed Miss Brinklow. "She looks hardly
  more than a child. So you have women lamas, then?"</p>

  <p>"There are no sex distinctions among us."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary business, this lamahood of yours," Mallinson commented
  loftily, after a pause. The rest of the tea-drinking proceeded without
  conversation; echoes of the harpsichord seemed still in the air, imposing a
  strange spell. Presently, leading the departure from the pavilion, Chang
  ventured to hope that the tour had been enjoyable. Conway, replying for the
  others, seesawed with the customary courtesies. Chang then assured them of
  his own equal enjoyment, and hoped they would consider the resources of the
  music room and library wholly at their disposal throughout their stay.
  Conway, with some sincerity, thanked him again. "But what about the lamas?"
  he added. "Don't they ever want to use them?"</p>

  <p>"They yield place with much gladness to their honored guests."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what I call real handsome," said Barnard. "And what's more,
  it shows that the lamas do really know we exist. That's a step forward,
  anyhow, makes me feel much more at home. You've certainly got a swell outfit
  here, Chang, and that little girl of yours plays the pi-anno very nicely. How
  old would she be, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot tell you."</p>

  <p>Barnard laughed. "You don't give away secrets about a lady's age, is that
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," answered Chang with a faintly shadowing smile.</p>

  <p>That evening, after dinner, Conway made occasion to leave the others and
  stroll out into the calm, moon-washed courtyards. Shangri-La was lovely then,
  touched with the mystery that lies at the core of all loveliness. The air was
  cold and still; the mighty spire of Karakal looked nearer, much nearer than
  by daylight. Conway was physically happy, emotionally satisfied, and mentally
  at ease; but in his intellect, which was not quite the same thing as mind,
  there was a little stir. He was puzzled. The line of secrecy that he had
  begun to map out grew sharper, but only to reveal an inscrutable background.
  The whole amazing series of events that had happened to him and his three
  chance companions swung now into a sort of focus; he could not yet understand
  them, but he believed they were somehow to be understood.</p>

  <p>Passing along a cloister, he reached the terrace leaning over the valley.
  The scent of tuberose assailed him, full of delicate associations; in China
  it was called "the smell of moonlight." He thought whimsically that if
  moonlight had a sound also, it might well be the Rameau gavotte he had heard
  so recently; and that set him thinking of the little Manchu. It had not
  occurred to him to picture women at Shangri-La; one did not associate their
  presence with the general practice of monasticism. Still, he reflected, it
  might not be a disagreeable innovation; indeed, a female harpsichordist might
  be an asset to any community that permitted itself to be (in Chang's words)
  "moderately heretical."</p>

  <p>He gazed over the edge into the blue-black emptiness. The drop was
  phantasmal; perhaps as much as a mile. He wondered if he would be allowed to
  descend it and inspect the valley civilization that had been talked of. The
  notion of this strange culture pocket, hidden amongst unknown ranges, and
  ruled over by some vague kind of theocracy, interested him as a student of
  history, apart from the curious though perhaps related secrets of the
  lamasery.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, on a flutter of air, came sounds from far below. Listening
  intently, he could hear gongs and trumpets and also (though perhaps only in
  imagination) the massed wail of voices. The sounds faded on a veer of the
  wind, then returned to fade again. But the hint of life and liveliness in
  those veiled depths served only to emphasize the austere serenity of
  Shangri-La. Its forsaken courts and pale pavilions shimmered in repose from
  which all the fret of existence had ebbed away, leaving a hush as if moments
  hardly dared to pass. Then, from a window high above the terrace, he caught
  the rose-gold of lantern light; was it there that the lamas devoted
  themselves to contemplation and the pursuit of wisdom, and were those
  devotions now in progress? The problem seemed one that he could solve merely
  by entering at the nearest door and exploring through gallery and corridor
  until the truth were his; but he knew that such freedom was illusory, and
  that in fact his movements were watched. Two Tibetans had padded across the
  terrace and were idling near the parapet. Good-humored fellows they looked,
  shrugging their colored cloaks negligently over naked shoulders. The whisper
  of gongs and trumpets uprose again, and Conway heard one of the men question
  his companion. The answer came: "They have buried Talu." Conway, whose
  knowledge of Tibetan was very slight, hoped they would continue talking; he
  could not gather much from a single remark. After a pause the questioner, who
  was inaudible, resumed the conversation, and obtained answers which Conway
  overheard and loosely understood as follows:</p>

  <p>"He died outside."</p>

  <p>"He obeyed the high ones of Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>"He came through the air over the great mountains with a bird to hold
  him."</p>

  <p>"Strangers he brought, also."</p>

  <p>"Talu was not afraid of the outside wind, nor of the outside cold."</p>

  <p>"Though he went outside long ago, the valley of Blue Moon remembers him
  still."</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said that Conway could interpret, and after waiting for
  some time he went back to his own quarters. He had heard enough to turn
  another key in the locked mystery, and it fitted so well that he wondered he
  had failed to supply it by his own deductions. It had, of course, crossed his
  mind, but a certain initial and fantastic unreasonableness about it had been
  too much for him. Now he perceived that the unreasonableness, however
  fantastic, was to be swallowed. That flight from Baskul had not been the
  meaningless exploit of a madman. It had been something planned, prepared, and
  carried out at the instigation of Shangri-La. The dead pilot was known by
  name to those who lived there; he had been one of them, in some sense; his
  death was mourned. Everything pointed to a high directing intelligence bent
  upon its own purposes; there had been, as it were, a single arch of
  intentions spanning the inexplicable hours and miles. But what WAS that
  intention? For what possible reason could four chance passengers in the
  British government aeroplane be whisked away to these trans-Himalayan
  solitudes?</p>

  <p>Conway was somewhat aghast at the problem, but by no means wholly
  displeased with it. It challenged him in the only way in which he was readily
  amenable to challenge&mdash;by touching a certain clarity of brain that only
  demanded a sufficient task. One thing he decided instantly; the cold thrill
  of discovery must not yet be communicated, neither to his companions, who
  could not help him, nor to his hosts, who doubtless would not.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I reckon some folks have to get used to worse places,"
  Barnard remarked towards the close of his first week at Shangri-La, and it
  was doubtless one of the many lessons to be drawn. By that time the party had
  settled themselves into something like a daily routine, and with Chang's
  assistance the boredom was no more acute than on many a planned holiday. They
  had all become acclimatized to the atmosphere, finding it quite invigorating
  so long as heavy exertion was avoided. They had learned that the days were
  warm and the nights cold, that the lamasery was almost completely sheltered
  from winds, that avalanches on Karakal were most frequent about midday, that
  the valley grew a good brand of tobacco, that some foods and drinks were more
  pleasant than others, and that each one of themselves had personal tastes and
  peculiarities. They had, in fact, discovered as much about each other as four
  new pupils of a school from which everyone else was mysteriously absent.
  Chang was tireless in his efforts to make smooth the rough places. He
  conducted excursions, suggested occupations, recommended books, talked with
  his slow, careful fluency whenever there was an awkward pause at meals, and
  was on every occasion benign, courteous, and resourceful. The line of
  demarcation was so marked between information willingly supplied and politely
  declined that the latter ceased to stir resentment, except fitfully from
  Mallinson. Conway was content to take note of it, adding another fragment to
  his constantly accumulating data. Barnard even "jollied" the Chinese after
  the manner and traditions of a Middle West Rotary convention. "You know,
  Chang, this is a damned bad hotel. Don't you have any newspapers sent here
  ever? I'd give all the books in your library for this morning's Herald
  Tribune." Chang's replies were always serious, though it did not necessarily
  follow that he took every question seriously. "We have the files of The
  Times, Mr. Barnard, up to a few years ago. But only, I regret to say, the
  London Times."</p>

  <p>Conway was glad to find that the valley was not to be "out of bounds,"
  though the difficulties of the descent made unescorted visits impossible. In
  company with Chang they all spent a whole day inspecting the green floor that
  was so pleasantly visible from the cliff edge, and to Conway, at any rate,
  the trip was of absorbing interest. They traveled in bamboo sedan chairs,
  swinging perilously over precipices while their bearers in front and to the
  rear picked a way nonchalantly down the steep track. It was not a route for
  the squeamish, but when at last they reached the lower levels of forest and
  foothill the supreme good fortune of the lamasery was everywhere to be
  realized. For the valley was nothing less than an enclosed paradise of
  amazing fertility, in which the vertical difference of a few thousand feet
  spanned the whole gulf between temperate and tropical. Crops of unusual
  diversity grew in profusion and contiguity, with not an inch of ground
  untended. The whole cultivated area stretched for perhaps a dozen miles,
  varying in width from one to five, and though narrow, it had the luck to take
  sunlight at the hottest part of the day. The atmosphere, indeed, was
  pleasantly warm even out of the sun, though the little rivulets that watered
  the soil were ice-cold from the snows. Conway felt again, as he gazed up at
  the stupendous mountain wall, that there was a superb and exquisite peril in
  the scene; but for some chance-placed barrier, the whole valley would clearly
  have been a lake, nourished continually from the glacial heights around it.
  Instead of which, a few streams dribbled through to fill reservoirs and
  irrigate fields and plantations with a disciplined conscientiousness worthy
  of a sanitary engineer. The whole design was almost uncannily fortunate, so
  long as the structure of the frame remained unmoved by earthquake or
  landslide.</p>

  <p>But even such vaguely future fears could only enhance the total loveliness
  of the present. Once again Conway was captivated, and by the same qualities
  of charm and ingenuity that had made his years in China happier than others.
  The vast encircling massif made perfect contrast with the tiny lawns and
  weedless gardens, the painted teahouses by the stream, and the frivolously
  toy-like houses. The inhabitants seemed to him a very successful blend of
  Chinese and Tibetan; they were cleaner and handsomer than the average of
  either race, and seemed to have suffered little from the inevitable
  inbreeding of such a small society. They smiled and laughed as they passed
  the chaired strangers, and had a friendly word for Chang; they were
  good-humored and mildly inquisitive, courteous and carefree, busy at
  innumerable jobs but not in any apparent hurry over them. Altogether Conway
  thought it one of the pleasantest communities he had ever seen, and even Miss
  Brinklow, who had been watching for symptoms of pagan degradation, had to
  admit that everything looked very well "on the surface." She was relieved to
  find the natives "completely" clothed, even though the women did wear
  ankle-tight Chinese trousers; and her most imaginative scrutiny of a Buddhist
  temple revealed only a few items that could be regarded as somewhat
  doubtfully phallic. Chang explained that the temple had its own lamas, who
  were under loose control from Shangri-La, though not of the same order. There
  were also, it appeared, a Taoist and a Confucian temple further along the
  valley. "The jewel has facets," said the Chinese, "and it is possible that
  many religions are moderately true."</p>

  <p>"I agree with that," said Barnard heartily. "I never did believe in
  sectarian jealousies. Chang, you're a philosopher, I must remember that
  remark of yours. 'Many religions are moderately true.' You fellows up on the
  mountain must be a lot of wise guys to have thought that out. You're right,
  too, I'm dead certain of it."</p>

  <p>"But we," responded Chang dreamily, "are only MODERATELY certain."</p>

  <p>Miss Brinklow could not be bothered with all that, which seemed to her a
  sign of mere laziness. In any case she was preoccupied with an idea of her
  own. "When I get back," she said with tightening lips, "I shall ask my
  society to send a missionary here. And if they grumble at the expense, I
  shall just bully them until they agree."</p>

  <p>That, clearly, was a much healthier spirit, and even Mallinson, little as
  he sympathized with foreign missions, could not forbear his admiration. "They
  ought to send YOU," he said. "That is, of course, if you'd like a place like
  this."</p>

  <p>"It's hardly a question of LIKING it," Miss Brinklow retorted. "One
  wouldn't like it, naturally&mdash;how could one? It's a matter of what one
  feels one ought to do."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Conway, "if I were a missionary I'd choose this rather
  than quite a lot of other places."</p>

  <p>"In that case," snapped Miss Brinklow, "there would be no merit in it,
  obviously."</p>

  <p>"But I wasn't thinking of merit."</p>

  <p>"More's the pity, then. There's no good in doing a thing because you like
  doing it. Look at these people here!"</p>

  <p>"They all seem very happy."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," she answered with a touch of fierceness. She added: "Anyhow, I
  don't see why I shouldn't make a beginning by studying the language. Can you
  lend me a book about it, Mr. Chang?"</p>

  <p>Chang was at his most mellifluous. "Most certainly, madam, with the
  greatest of pleasure. And, if I may say so, I think the idea an excellent
  one."</p>

  <p>When they ascended to Shangri-La that evening he treated the matter as one
  of immediate importance. Miss Brinklow was at first a little daunted by the
  massive volume compiled by an industrious nineteenth-century German (she had
  more probably imagined some slighter work of a "Brush up your Tibetan" type),
  but with help from the Chinese and encouragement from Conway she made a good
  beginning and was soon observed to be extracting grim satisfaction from her
  task.</p>

  <p>Conway, too, found much to interest him, apart from the engrossing problem
  he had set himself. During the warm, sunlit days he made full use of the
  library and music room, and was confirmed in his impression that the lamas
  were of quite exceptional culture. Their taste in books was catholic, at any
  rate; Plato in Greek touched Omar in English; Nietzsche partnered Newton;
  Thomas More was there, and also Hannah More, Thomas Moore, George Moore, and
  even Old Moore. Altogether Conway estimated the number of volumes at between
  twenty and thirty thousand; and it was tempting to speculate upon the method
  of selection and acquisition. He sought also to discover how recently there
  had been additions, but he did not come across anything later than a cheap
  reprint of Im Western Nichts Neues. During a subsequent visit, however, Chang
  told him that there were other books published up to about the middle of 1930
  which would doubtless be added to the shelves eventually; they had already
  arrived at the lamasery. "We keep ourselves fairly up-to-date, you see," he
  commented.</p>

  <p>"There are people who would hardly agree with you," replied Conway with a
  smile. "Quite a lot of things have happened in the world since last year, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of importance, my dear sir, that could not have been foreseen in
  1920, or that will not be better understood in 1940."</p>

  <p>"You're not interested, then, in the latest developments of the world
  crisis?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be very deeply interested&mdash;in due course."</p>

  <p>"You know, Chang, I believe I'm beginning to understand you. You're geared
  differently, that's what it is. Time means less to you than it does to most
  people. If I were in London I wouldn't always be eager to see the latest
  hour-old newspaper, and you at Shangri-La are no more eager to see a year-old
  one. Both attitudes seem to me quite sensible. By the way, how long is it
  since you last had visitors here?"</p>

  <p>"That, Mr. Conway, I am unfortunately unable to say."</p>

  <p>It was the usual ending to a conversation, and one that Conway found less
  irritating than the opposite phenomenon from which he had suffered much in
  his time&mdash;the conversation which, try as he would, seemed never to end.
  He began to like Chang rather more as their meetings multiplied, though it
  still puzzled him that he met so few of the lamasery personnel; even assuming
  that the lamas themselves were unapproachable, were there not other
  postulants besides Chang?</p>

  <p>There was, of course, the little Manchu. He saw her sometimes when he
  visited the music room; but she knew no English, and he was still unwilling
  to disclose his own Chinese. He could not quite determine whether she played
  merely for pleasure, or was in some way a student. Her playing, as indeed her
  whole behavior, was exquisitely formal, and her choice lay always among the
  more patterned compositions&mdash;those of Bach, Corelli, Scarlatti, and
  occasionally Mozart. She preferred the harpsichord to the piano, but when
  Conway went to the latter she would listen with grave and almost dutiful
  appreciation. It was impossible to know what was in her mind; it was
  difficult even to guess her age. He would have doubted her being over thirty
  or under thirteen; and yet, in a curious way, such manifest unlikelihoods
  could neither of them be ruled out as wholly impossible.</p>

  <p>Mallinson, who sometimes came to listen to the music for want of anything
  better to do, found her a very baffling proposition. "I can't think what
  she's doing here," he said to Conway more than once. "This lama business may
  be all right for an old fellow like Chang, but what's the attraction in it
  for a girl? How long has she been here, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder too, but it's one of those things we're not likely to be
  told."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose she likes being here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm bound to say she doesn't appear to DIS-like it."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't appear to have feelings at all, for that matter. She's like a
  little ivory doll more than a human being."</p>

  <p>"A charming thing to be like, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"As far as it goes."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "And it goes pretty far, Mallinson, when you come to think
  about it. After all, the ivory doll has manners, good taste in dress,
  attractive looks, a pretty touch on the harpsichord, and she doesn't move
  about a room as if she were playing hockey. Western Europe, so far as I
  recollect it, contains an exceptionally large number of females who lack
  those virtues."</p>

  <p>"You're an awful cynic about women, Conway."</p>

  <p>Conway was used to the charge. He had not actually had a great deal to do
  with the other sex, and during occasional leaves in Indian hill stations the
  reputation of cynic had been as easy to sustain as any other. In truth he had
  had several delightful friendships with women who would have been pleased to
  marry him if he had asked them&mdash;but he had not asked them. He had once
  got nearly as far as an announcement in the Morning Post, but the girl did
  not want to live in Pekin and he did not want to live at Tunbridge Wells,
  mutual reluctances which proved impossible to dislodge. So far as he had had
  experience of women at all, it had been tentative, intermittent, and somewhat
  inconclusive. But he was not, after all that, a cynic about them.</p>

  <p>He said with a laugh: "I'm thirty-seven&mdash;you're twenty-four. That's
  all it amounts to."</p>

  <p>After a pause Mallinson asked suddenly: "Oh, by the way, how old should
  you say Chang is?"</p>

  <p>"Anything," replied Conway lightly, "between forty-nine and a hundred and
  forty-nine."</p>

  <p>Such information, however, was less trustworthy than much else that was
  available to the new arrivals. The fact that their curiosities were sometimes
  unsatisfied tended to obscure the really vast quantity of data which Chang
  was always willing to outpour. There were no secrecies, for instance, about
  the customs and habits of the valley population, and Conway, who was
  interested, had talks which might have been worked up into a quite
  serviceable degree thesis. He was particularly interested, as a student of
  affairs, in the way the valley population was governed; it appeared, on
  examination, to be a rather loose and elastic autocracy operated from the
  lamasery with a benevolence that was almost casual. It was certainly an
  established success, as every descent into that fertile paradise made more
  evident. Conway was puzzled as to the ultimate basis of law and order; there
  appeared to be neither soldiers nor police, yet surely some provision must be
  made for the incorrigible? Chang replied that crime was very rare, partly
  because only serious things were considered crimes, and partly because
  everyone enjoyed a sufficiency of everything he could reasonably desire. In
  the last resort the personal servants of the lamasery had power to expel an
  offender from the valley&mdash;though this, which was considered an extreme
  and dreadful punishment, had only very occasionally to be imposed. But the
  chief factor in the government of Blue Moon, Chang went on to say, was the
  inculcation of good manners, which made men feel that certain things were
  "not done," and that they lost caste by doing them. "You English inculcate
  the same feeling," said Chang, "in your public schools, but not, I fear, in
  regard to the same things. The inhabitants of our valley, for instance, feel
  that it is 'not done' to be inhospitable to strangers, to dispute
  acrimoniously, or to strive for priority amongst one another. The idea of
  enjoying what your English headmasters call the mimic warfare of the playing
  field would seem to them entirely barbarous&mdash;indeed, a sheerly wanton
  stimulation of all the lower instincts."</p>

  <p>Conway asked if there were never disputes about women.</p>

  <p>"Only very rarely, because it would not be considered good manners to take
  a woman that another man wanted."</p>

  <p>"Supposing somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't care a damn whether
  it was good manners or not?"</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear sir, it would be good manners on the part of the other man
  to let him have her, and also on the part of the woman to be equally
  agreeable. You would be surprised, Conway, how the application of a little
  courtesy all round helps to smooth out these problems."</p>

  <p>Certainly during visits to the valley Conway found a spirit of goodwill
  and contentment that pleased him all the more because he knew that of all the
  arts, that of government has been brought least to perfection. When he made
  some complimentary remark, however, Chang responded: "Ah, but you see, we
  believe that to govern perfectly it is necessary to avoid governing too
  much."</p>

  <p>"Yet you don't have any democratic machinery&mdash;voting, and so on?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. Our people would be quite shocked by having to declare that one
  policy was completely right and another completely wrong."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. He found the attitude a curiously sympathetic one.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Miss Brinklow derived her own kind of satisfaction from a study
  of Tibetan; meanwhile, also, Mallinson fretted and groused, and Barnard
  persisted in an equanimity which seemed almost equally remarkable, whether it
  were real or simulated.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," said Mallinson, "the fellow's cheerfulness is
  just about getting on my nerves. I can understand him trying to keep a stiff
  lip, but that continual joking of his begins to upset me. He'll be the life
  and soul of the party if we don't watch him."</p>

  <p>Conway too had once or twice wondered at the ease with which the American
  had managed to settle down. He replied: "Isn't it rather lucky for us he DOES
  take things so well?"</p>

  <p>"Personally, I think it's damned peculiar. What do you KNOW about him,
  Conway? I mean who he is, and so on."</p>

  <p>"Not much more than you do. I understood he came from Persia and was
  supposed to have been oil prospecting. It's his way to take things easily
  &mdash;when the air evacuation was arranged I had quite a job to persuade him
  to join us at all. He only agreed when I told him that an American passport
  wouldn't stop a bullet."</p>

  <p>"By the way, did you ever see his passport?"</p>

  <p>"Probably I did, but I don't remember. Why?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson laughed. "I'm afraid you'll think I haven't exactly been minding
  my own business. Why should I, anyhow? Two months in this place ought to
  reveal all our secrets, if we have any. Mind you, it was a sheer accident, in
  the way it happened, and I haven't let slip a word to anyone else, of course.
  I didn't think I'd tell even you, but now we've got on to the subject I may
  as well."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, but I wish you'd let me know what you're talking
  about."</p>

  <p>"Just this. Barnard was traveling on a forged passport and he isn't
  Barnard at all."</p>

  <p>Conway raised his eyebrows with an interest that was very much less than
  concern. He liked Barnard, so far as the man stirred him to any emotion at
  all; but it was quite impossible for him to care intensely who he really was
  or wasn't. He said: "Well, who do you think he is, then?"</p>

  <p>"He's Chalmers Bryant."</p>

  <p>"The deuce he is! What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"He dropped a pocketbook this morning and Chang picked it up and gave it
  to me, thinking it was mine. I couldn't help seeing it was stuffed with
  newspaper clippings&mdash;some of them fell out as I was handling the thing,
  and I don't mind admitting that I looked at them. After all, newspaper
  clippings aren't private, or shouldn't be. They were all about Bryant and the
  search for him, and one of them had a photograph which was absolutely like
  Barnard except for a mustache."</p>

  <p>"Did you mention your discovery to Barnard himself?"</p>

  <p>"No, I just handed him his property without any comment."</p>

  <p>"So the whole thing rests on your identification of a newspaper
  photograph?"</p>

  <p>"Well, so far, yes."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'd care to convict anyone on that. Of course you might be
  right&mdash;I don't say he couldn't POSSIBLY be Bryant. If he were, it would
  account for a good deal of his contentment at being here&mdash;he could
  hardly have found a better place to hide."</p>

  <p>Mallinson seemed a trifle disappointed by this casual reception of news
  which he evidently thought highly sensational. "Well, what are you going to
  do about it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Conway pondered a moment and then answered: "I haven't much of an idea.
  Probably nothing at all. What can one do, in any case?"</p>

  <p>"But dash it all, if the man IS Bryant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mallinson, if the man were Nero it wouldn't have to matter to us
  for the time being! Saint or crook, we've got to make what we can of each
  other's company as long as we're here, and I can't see that we shall help
  matters by striking any attitudes. If I'd suspected who he was at Baskul, of
  course, I'd have tried to get in touch with Delhi about him&mdash;it would
  have been merely a public duty. But now I think I can claim to be OFF
  duty."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that's rather a slack way of looking at it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care if it's slack so long as it's sensible."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that means your advice to me is to forget what I've found
  out?"</p>

  <p>"You probably can't do that, but I certainly think we might both of us
  keep our own counsel about it. Not in consideration for Barnard or Bryant or
  whoever he is, but to save ourselves the deuce of an awkward situation when
  we get away."</p>

  <p>"You mean we ought to let him go?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll put it a bit differently and say we ought to give somebody
  else the pleasure of catching him. When you've lived quite sociably with a
  man for a few months, it seems a little out of place to call for the
  handcuffs."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I agree. The man's nothing but a large-scale thief&mdash; I
  know plenty of people who've lost their money through him."</p>

  <p>Conway shrugged his shoulders. He admired the simple black-and-white of
  Mallinson's code; the public school ethic might be crude, but at least it was
  downright. If a man broke the law, it was everyone's duty to hand him over to
  justice&mdash;always provided that it was the kind of law one was not allowed
  to break. And the law pertaining to checks and shares and balance sheets was
  decidedly that kind. Bryant had transgressed it, and though Conway had not
  taken much interest in the case, he had an impression that it was a fairly
  bad one of its kind. All he knew was that the failure of the giant Bryant
  group in New York had resulted in losses of about a hundred million
  dollars&mdash;a record crash, even in a world that exuded records. In some
  way or other (Conway was not a financial expert) Bryant had been monkeying on
  Wall Street, and the result had been a warrant for his arrest, his escape to
  Europe, and extradition orders against him in half a dozen countries.</p>

  <p>Conway said finally: "Well, if you take my tip you'll say nothing about it
  &mdash;not for his sake but for ours. Please yourself, of course, so long as
  you don't forget the possibility that he mayn't be the fellow at all."</p>

  <p>But he was, and the revelation came that evening after dinner. Chang had
  left them; Miss Brinklow had turned to her Tibetan grammar; the three male
  exiles faced each other over coffee and cigars. Conversation during the meal
  would have languished more than once but for the tact and affability of the
  Chinese; now, in his absence, a rather unhappy silence supervened. Barnard
  was for once without jokes. It was clear to Conway that it lay beyond
  Mallinson's power to treat the American as if nothing had happened, and it
  was equally clear that Barnard was shrewdly aware that something HAD
  happened.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the American threw away his cigar. "I guess you all know who I
  am," he said.</p>

  <p>Mallinson colored like a girl, but Conway replied in the same quiet key:
  "Yes, Mallinson and I think we do."</p>

  <p>"Darned careless of me to leave those clippings lying about."</p>

  <p>"We're all apt to be careless at times."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're mighty calm about it, that's something."</p>

  <p>There was another silence, broken at length by Miss Brinklow's shrill
  voice: "I'm sure I don't know who you are, Mr. Barnard, though I must say I
  guessed all along you were traveling incognito." They all looked at her
  enquiringly and she went on: "I remember when Mr. Conway said we should all
  have our names in the papers, you said it didn't affect you. I thought then
  that Barnard probably wasn't your real name."</p>

  <p>The culprit gave a slow smile as he lit himself another cigar. "Madam," he
  said eventually, "you're not only a smart detective, but you've hit on a
  really polite name for my present position, I'm traveling incognito. You've
  said it, and you're dead right. As for you boys, I'm not sorry in a way that
  you've found me out. So long as none of you had an inkling, we could all have
  managed, but considering how we're fixed it wouldn't seem very neighborly to
  play the high hat with you now. You folks have been so darned nice to me that
  I don't want to make a lot of trouble. It looks as if we were all going to be
  joined together for better or worse for some little time ahead, and it's up
  to us to help one another out as far as we can. As for what happens
  afterwards, I reckon we can leave that to settle itself."</p>

  <p>All this appeared to Conway so eminently reasonable that he gazed at
  Barnard with considerably greater interest, and even&mdash;though it was
  perhaps odd at such a moment&mdash;a touch of genuine appreciation. It was
  curious to think of that heavy, fleshy, good-humored, rather paternal-looking
  man as the world's hugest swindler. He looked far more the type that, with a
  little extra education, would have made a popular headmaster of a prep
  school. Behind his joviality there were signs of recent strains and worries,
  but that did not mean that the joviality was forced. He obviously was what he
  looked&mdash;a "good fellow" in the world's sense, by nature a lamb and only
  by profession a shark.</p>

  <p>Conway said: "Yes, that's very much the best thing, I'm certain."</p>

  <p>Then Barnard laughed. It was as if he possessed even deeper reserves of
  good humor which he could only now draw upon. "Gosh, but it's mighty queer,"
  he exclaimed, spreading himself in his chair. "The whole darned business, I
  mean. Right across Europe, and on through Turkey and Persia to that little
  one-horse burg! Police after me all the time, mind you&mdash;they nearly got
  me in Vienna! It's pretty exciting at first, being chased, but it gets on
  your nerves after a bit. I got a good rest at Baskul, though&mdash;I thought
  I'd be safe in the midst of a revolution."</p>

  <p>"And so you were," said Conway with a slight smile, "except from
  bullets."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and that's what bothered me at the finish. I can tell you it was a
  mighty hard choice&mdash;whether to stay in Baskul and get plugged, or accept
  a trip in your government's aeroplane and find the bracelets waiting at the
  other end. I wasn't exactly keen to do either."</p>

  <p>"I remember you weren't."</p>

  <p>Barnard laughed again. "Well, that's how it was, and you can figure it out
  for yourself that the change of plan which brought me here don't worry me an
  awful lot. It's a first-class mystery, but, speaking personally, there
  couldn't have been a better one. It isn't my way to grumble as long as I'm
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>Conway's smile became more definitely cordial. "A very sensible attitude,
  though I think you rather overdid it. We were all beginning to wonder how you
  managed to be so contented."</p>

  <p>"Well, I WAS contented. This ain't a bad place, when you get used to it.
  The air's a bit snappy at first, but you can't have everything. And it's nice
  and quiet for a change. Every fall I go down to Palm Beach for a rest cure,
  but they don't give you it, those places&mdash;you're in the racket just the
  same. But here I guess I'm having just what the doctor ordered, and it
  certainly feels grand to me. I'm on a different diet, I can't look at the
  tape, and my broker can't get me on the telephone."</p>

  <p>"I daresay he wishes he could."</p>

  <p>"Sure. There'll be a tidy-sized mess to clear up, and I know it."</p>

  <p>He said this with such simplicity that Conway could not help responding:
  "I'm not much of an authority on what people call high finance."</p>

  <p>It was a lead, and the American accepted it without the slightest
  reluctance. "High finance," he said, "is mostly a lot of bunk."</p>

  <p>"So I've often suspected."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Conway, I'll put it like this. A feller does what he's been
  doing for years, and what lots of other fellers have been doing, and suddenly
  the market goes against him. He can't help it, but he braces up and waits for
  the turn. But somehow the turn don't come as it always used to, and when he's
  lost ten million dollars or so he reads in some paper that a Swede professor
  thinks it's the end of the world. Now I ask you, does that sort of thing help
  markets? Of course, it gives him a bit of a shock, but he still can't help
  it. And there he is till the cops come&mdash;if he waits for 'em. I
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"You claim it was all just a run of bad luck, then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I certainly had a large packet."</p>

  <p>"You also had other people's money," put in Mallinson sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I did. And why? Because they all wanted something for nothing and
  hadn't the brains to get it for themselves."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree. It was because they trusted you and thought their money
  was safe."</p>

  <p>"Well, it wasn't safe. It couldn't be. There isn't safety anywhere, and
  those who thought there was were like a lot of saps trying to hide under an
  umbrella in a typhoon."</p>

  <p>Conway said pacifyingly: "Well, we'll all admit you couldn't help the
  typhoon."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't even pretend to help it&mdash;any more than you could help
  what happened after we left Baskul. The same thing struck me then as I
  watched you in the aeroplane keeping dead calm while Mallinson here had the
  fidgets. You knew you couldn't do anything about it, and you weren't caring
  two hoots. Just like I felt myself when the crash came."</p>

  <p>"That's nonsense!" cried Mallinson. "Anyone can help swindling. It's a
  matter of playing the game according to the rules."</p>

  <p>"Which is a darned difficult thing to do when the whole game's going to
  pieces. Besides, there isn't a soul in the world who knows what the rules
  are. All the professors of Harvard and Yale couldn't tell you 'em."</p>

  <p>Mallinson replied rather scornfully: "I'm referring to a few quite simple
  rules of everyday conduct."</p>

  <p>"Then I guess your everyday conduct doesn't include managing trust
  companies."</p>

  <p>Conway made haste to intervene. "We'd better not argue. I don't object in
  the least to the comparison between your affairs and mine. No doubt we've all
  been flying blind lately, both literally and in other ways. But we're here
  now, that's the important thing, and I agree with you that we could easily
  have had more to grumble about. It's curious, when you come to think about
  it, that out of four people picked up by chance and kidnaped a thousand
  miles, three should be able to find some consolation in the business. YOU
  want a rest cure and a hiding place; Miss Brinklow feels a call to evangelize
  the heathen Tibetan."</p>

  <p>"Who's the third person you're counting?" Mallinson interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Not me, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"I was including myself," answered Conway. "And my own reason is perhaps
  the simplest of all&mdash;I just rather like being here."</p>

  <p>Indeed, a short time later, when he took what had come to be his usual
  solitary evening stroll along the terrace or beside the lotus pool, he felt
  an extraordinary sense of physical and mental settlement. It was perfectly
  true; he just rather liked being at Shangri-La. Its atmosphere soothed while
  its mystery stimulated, and the total sensation was agreeable. For some days
  now he had been reaching, gradually and tentatively, a curious conclusion
  about the lamasery and its inhabitants; his brain was still busy with it,
  though in a deeper sense he was unperturbed. He was like a mathematician with
  an abstruse problem&mdash;worrying over it, but worrying very calmly and
  impersonally.</p>

  <p>As for Bryant, whom he decided he would still think of and address as
  Barnard, the question of his exploits and identity faded instantly into the
  background, save for a single phrase of his&mdash;"the whole game's going to
  pieces." Conway found himself remembering and echoing it with a wider
  significance than the American had probably intended; he felt it to be true
  of more than American banking and trust-company management. It fitted Baskul
  and Delhi and London, war-making and empire-building, consulates and trade
  concessions and dinner parties at Government House; there was a reek of
  dissolution over all that recollected world, and Barnard's cropper had only,
  perhaps, been better dramatized than his own. The whole game WAS doubtless
  going to pieces, but fortunately the players were not as a rule put on trial
  for the pieces they had failed to save. In that respect financiers were
  unlucky.</p>

  <p>But here, at Shangri-La, all was in deep calm. In a moonless sky the stars
  were lit to the full, and a pale blue sheen lay upon the dome of Karakal.
  Conway realized then that if by some change of plan the porters from the
  outside world were to arrive immediately, he would not be completely
  overjoyed at being spared the interval of waiting. And neither would Barnard,
  he reflected with an inward smile. It was amusing, really; and then suddenly
  he knew that he still liked Barnard, or he wouldn't have found it amusing.
  Somehow the loss of a hundred million dollars was too much to bar a man for;
  it would have been easier if he had only stolen one's watch. And after all,
  how COULD anyone lose a hundred millions? Perhaps only in the sense in which
  a cabinet minister might airily announce that he had been "given India."</p>

  <p>And then again he thought of the time when he would leave Shangri-La with
  the returning porters. He pictured the long, arduous journey, and that
  eventual moment of arrival at some planter's bungalow in Sikkim or Baltistan
  &mdash;a moment which ought, he felt, to be deliriously cheerful, but which
  would probably be slightly disappointing. Then the first hand shakings and
  self-introductions; the first drinks on clubhouse verandas; sun-bronzed faces
  staring at him in barely concealed incredulity. At Delhi, no doubt,
  interviews with the viceroy and the C.I.C., salaams of turbaned menials;
  endless reports to be prepared and sent off. Perhaps even a return to England
  and Whitehall; deck games on the P. &amp; O.; the flaccid palm of an under
  secretary; newspaper interviews; hard, mocking, sex-thirsty voices of women
  &mdash;"And is it really true, Mr. Conway, that when you were in Tibet...?"
  There was no doubt of one thing; he would be able to dine out on his yarn for
  at least a season. But would he enjoy it? He recalled a sentence penned by
  Gordon during the last days at Khartoum&mdash;"I would sooner live like a
  dervish with the Mahdi than go out to dinner every night in London." Conway's
  aversion was less definite&mdash;a mere anticipation that to tell his story
  in the past tense would bore him a great deal as well as sadden him a
  little.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, in the midst of his reflections, he was aware of Chang's
  approach. "Sir," began the Chinese, his slow whisper slightly quickening as
  he spoke, "I am proud to be the bearer of important news..."</p>

  <p>So the porters HAD come before their time, was Conway's first thought; it
  was odd that he should have been thinking of it so recently. And he felt the
  pang that he was half-prepared for. "Well?" he queried.</p>

  <p>Chang's condition was as nearly that of excitement as seemed physically
  possible for him. "My dear sir, I congratulate you," he continued. "And I am
  happy to think that I am in some measure responsible&mdash;it was after my
  own strong and repeated recommendations that the High Lama made his decision.
  He wishes to see you immediately."</p>

  <p>Conway's glance was quizzical. "You're being less coherent than usual,
  Chang. What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"The High Lama has sent for you."</p>

  <p>"So I gather. But why all the fuss?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is extraordinary and unprecedented&mdash;even I who urged it
  did not expect it to happen yet. A fortnight ago you had not arrived, and now
  you are about to be received by HIM! Never before has it occurred so
  soon!"</p>

  <p>"I'm still rather fogged, you know. I'm to see your High Lama&mdash;I
  realize that all right. But is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Is it not enough?"</p>

  <p>Conway laughed. "Absolutely, I assure you&mdash;don't imagine I'm being
  discourteous. As a matter of fact, something quite different was in my head
  at first. However, never mind about that now. Of course, I shall be both
  honored and delighted to meet the gentleman. When is the appointment?"</p>

  <p>"Now. I have been sent to bring you to him."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather late?"</p>

  <p>"That is of no consequence. My dear sir, you will understand many things
  very soon. And may I add my own personal pleasure that this
  interval&mdash;always an awkward one&mdash;is now at an end. Believe me, it
  has been irksome to me to have to refuse you information on so many
  occasions&mdash; extremely irksome. I am joyful in the knowledge that such
  unpleasantness will never again be necessary."</p>

  <p>"You're a queer fellow, Chang," Conway responded. "But let's be going,
  don't bother to explain anymore. I'm perfectly ready and I appreciate your
  nice remarks. Lead the way."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Conway was quite unruffled, but his demeanor covered an
  eagerness that grew in intensity as he accompanied Chang across the empty
  courtyards. If the words of the Chinese meant anything, he was on the
  threshold of discovery; soon he would know whether his theory, still
  half-formed, were less impossible than it appeared.</p>

  <p>Apart from this, it would doubtless be an interesting interview. He had
  met many peculiar potentates in his time; he took a detached interest in
  them, and was shrewd as a rule in his assessments. Without self-consciousness
  he had also the valuable knack of being able to say polite things in
  languages of which he knew very little indeed. Perhaps, however, he would be
  chiefly a listener on this occasion. He noticed that Chang was taking him
  through rooms he had not seen before, all of them rather dim and lovely in
  lantern light. Then a spiral staircase climbed to a door at which the Chinese
  knocked, and which was opened by a Tibetan servant with such promptness that
  Conway suspected he had been stationed behind it. This part of the lamasery,
  on a higher storey, was no less tastefully embellished than the rest, but its
  most immediately striking feature was a dry, tingling warmth, as if all the
  windows were tightly closed and some kind of steam-heating plant were working
  at full pressure. The airlessness increased as he passed on, until at last
  Chang paused before a door which, if bodily sensation could have been
  trusted, might well have admitted to a Turkish bath.</p>

  <p>"The High Lama," whispered Chang, "will receive you alone." Having opened
  the door for Conway's entrance, he closed it afterwards so silently that his
  own departure was almost imperceptible. Conway stood hesitant, breathing an
  atmosphere that was not only sultry, but full of dusk, so that it was several
  seconds before he could accustom his eyes to the gloom. Then he slowly built
  up an impression of a dark-curtained, low-roofed apartment, simply furnished
  with table and chairs. On one of these sat a small, pale, and wrinkled
  person, motionlessly shadowed and yielding an effect as of some fading,
  antique portrait in chiaroscuro. If there were such a thing as presence
  divorced from actuality, here it was, adorned with a classic dignity that was
  more an emanation than an attribute. Conway was curious about his own intense
  perception of all this, and wondered if it were dependable or merely his
  reaction to the rich, crepuscular warmth; he felt dizzy under the gaze of
  those ancient eyes, took a few forward paces, and then halted. The occupant
  of the chair grew now less vague in outline, but scarcely more corporeal; he
  was a little old man in Chinese dress, its folds and flounces loose against a
  flat, emaciated frame. "You are Mr. Conway?" he whispered in excellent
  English.</p>

  <p>The voice was pleasantly soothing, and touched with a very gentle
  melancholy that fell upon Conway with strange beatitude; though once again
  the skeptic in him was inclined to hold the temperature responsible.</p>

  <p>"I am," he answered.</p>

  <p>The voice went on. "It is a pleasure to see you, Mr. Conway. I sent for
  you because I thought we should do well to have a talk together. Please sit
  down beside me and have no fear. I am an old man and can do no one any
  harm."</p>

  <p>Conway answered: "I feel it a signal honor to be received by you."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, my dear Conway&mdash;I shall call you that, according to
  your English fashion. It is, as I said, a moment of great pleasure for me. My
  sight is poor, but believe me, I am able to see you in my mind, as well as
  with my eyes. I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La since your
  arrival?"</p>

  <p>"Extremely so."</p>

  <p>"I am glad. Chang has done his best for you, no doubt. It has been a great
  pleasure to him also. He tells me you have been asking many questions about
  our community and its affairs?"</p>

  <p>"I am certainly interested in them."</p>

  <p>"Then if you can spare me a little time, I shall be pleased to give you a
  brief account of our foundation."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing I should appreciate more."</p>

  <p>"That is what I had thought&mdash;and hoped... But first of all, before
  our discourse..."</p>

  <p>He made the slightest stir of a hand, and immediately, by what technique
  of summons Conway could not detect, a servant entered to prepare the elegant
  ritual of tea-drinking. The little eggshell bowls of almost colorless fluid
  were placed on a lacquered tray; Conway, who knew the ceremony, was by no
  means contemptuous of it. The voice resumed: "Our ways are familiar to you,
  then?"</p>

  <p>Obeying an impulse which he could neither analyze nor find desire to
  control, Conway answered: "I lived in China for some years."</p>

  <p>"You did not tell Chang?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then why am I so honored?"</p>

  <p>Conway was rarely at a loss to explain his own motives, but on this
  occasion he could not think of any reason at all. At length he replied: "To
  be quite candid, I haven't the slightest idea, except that I must have wanted
  to tell you."</p>

  <p>"The best of all reasons, I am sure, between those who are to become
  friends... Now tell me, is this not a delicate aroma? The teas of China are
  many and fragrant, but this, which is a special product of our own valley, is
  in my opinion their equal."</p>

  <p>Conway lifted the bowl to his lips and tasted. The savor was slender,
  elusive, and recondite, a ghostly bouquet that haunted rather than lived on
  the tongue. He said: "It is very delightful, and also quite new to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, like a great many of our valley herbs, it is both unique and
  precious. It should be tasted, of course, very slowly&mdash;not only in
  reverence and affection, but to extract the fullest degree of pleasure. This
  is a famous lesson that we may learn from Kou Kai Tchou, who lived some
  fifteen centuries ago. He would always hesitate to reach the succulent marrow
  when he was eating a piece of sugarcane, for, as he explained&mdash;'I
  introduce myself gradually into the region of delights.' Have you studied any
  of the great Chinese classics?"</p>

  <p>Conway replied that he was slightly acquainted with a few of them. He knew
  that the allusive conversation would, according to etiquette, continue until
  the tea bowls were taken away; but he found it far from irritating, despite
  his keenness to hear the history of Shangri-La. Doubtless there was a certain
  amount of Kou Kai Tchou's reluctant sensibility in himself.</p>

  <p>At length the signal was given, again mysteriously, the servant padded in
  and out, and with no more preamble the High Lama of Shangri-La began:</p>

  <p>"Probably you are familiar, my dear Conway, with the general outline of
  Tibetan history. I am informed by Chang that you have made ample use of our
  library here, and I doubt not that you have studied the scanty but
  exceedingly interesting annals of these regions. You will be aware, anyhow,
  that Nestorian Christianity was widespread throughout Asia during the Middle
  Ages, and that its memory lingered long after its actual decay. In the
  seventeenth century a Christian revival was impelled directly from Rome
  through the agency of those heroic Jesuit missionaries whose journeys, if I
  may permit myself the remark, are so much more interesting to read of than
  those of St. Paul. Gradually the Church established itself over an immense
  area, and it is a remarkable fact, not realized by many Europeans today, that
  for thirty-eight years there existed a Christian mission in Lhasa itself. It
  was not, however, from Lhasa but from Pekin, in the year 1719, that four
  Capuchin friars set out in search of any remnants of the Nestorian faith that
  might still be surviving in the hinterland.</p>

  <p>"They traveled southwest for many months, by Lanchow and the Koko-Nor,
  facing hardships which you will well imagine. Three died on the way, and the
  fourth was not far from death when by accident he stumbled into the rocky
  defile that remains today the only practical approach to the valley of Blue
  Moon. There, to his joy and surprise, he found a friendly and prosperous
  population who made haste to display what I have always regarded as our
  oldest tradition&mdash;that of hospitality to strangers. Quickly he recovered
  health and began to preach his mission. The people were Buddhists, but
  willing to hear him, and he had considerable success. There was an ancient
  lamasery existing then on this same mountain shelf, but it was in a state of
  decay both physical and spiritual, and as the Capuchin's harvest increased,
  he conceived the idea of setting up on the same magnificent site a Christian
  monastery. Under his surveillance the old buildings were repaired and largely
  reconstructed, and he himself began to live here in the year 1734, when he
  was fifty-three years of age.</p>

  <p>"Now let me tell you more about this man. His name was Perrault, and he
  was by birth a Luxembourger. Before devoting himself to Far Eastern missions
  he had studied at Paris, Bologna, and other universities; he was something of
  a scholar. There are few existing records of his early life, but it was not
  in any way unusual for one of his age and profession. He was fond of music
  and the arts, had a special aptitude for languages, and before he was sure of
  his vocation he had tasted all the familiar pleasures of the world.
  Malplaquet was fought when he was a youth, and he knew from personal contact
  the horrors of war and invasion. He was physically sturdy; during his first
  years here he labored with his hands like any other man, tilling his own
  garden, and learning from the inhabitants as well as teaching them. He found
  gold deposits along the valley, but they did not tempt him; he was more
  deeply interested in local plants and herbs. He was humble and by no means
  bigoted. He deprecated polygamy, but he saw no reason to inveigh against the
  prevalent fondness for the tangatse berry, to which were ascribed medicinal
  properties, but which was chiefly popular because its effects were those of a
  mild narcotic. Perrault, in fact, became somewhat of an addict himself; it
  was his way to accept from native life all that it offered which he found
  harmless and pleasant, and to give in return the spiritual treasure of the
  West. He was not an ascetic; he enjoyed the good things of the world, and was
  careful to teach his converts cooking as well as catechism. I want you to
  have an impression of a very earnest, busy, learned, simple, and enthusiastic
  person who, along with his priestly functions, did not disdain to put on a
  mason's overall and help in the actual building of these very rooms. That
  was, of course, a work of immense difficulty, and one which nothing but his
  pride and steadfastness could have overcome. Pride, I say, because it was
  undoubtedly a dominant motive at the beginning&mdash;the pride in his own
  Faith that made him decide that if Gautama could inspire men to build a
  temple on the ledge of Shangri-La, Rome was capable of no less.</p>

  <p>"But time passed, and it was not unnatural that this motive should yield
  place gradually to more tranquil ones. Emulation is, after all, a young man's
  spirit, and Perrault, by the time his monastery was well established, was
  already full of years. You must bear in mind that he had not, from a strict
  point of view, been acting very regularly; though some latitude must surely
  be extended to one whose ecclesiastical superiors are located at a distance
  measurable in years rather than miles. But the folk of the valley and the
  monks themselves had no misgivings; they loved and obeyed him, and as years
  went on, came to venerate him also. At intervals it was his custom to send
  reports to the Bishop of Pekin; but often they never reached him, and as it
  was to be presumed that the bearers had succumbed to the perils of the
  journey, Perrault grew more and more unwilling to hazard their lives, and
  after about the middle of the century he gave up the practice. Some of his
  earlier messages, however, must have got through, and a doubt of his
  activities have been aroused, for in the year 1769 a stranger brought a
  letter written twelve years before, summoning Perrault to Rome.</p>

  <p>"He would have been over seventy had the command been received without
  delay; as it was, he had turned eighty-nine. The long trek over mountain and
  plateau was unthinkable; he could never have endured the scouring gales and
  fierce chills of the wilderness outside. He sent, therefore, a courteous
  reply explaining the situation, but there is no record that his message ever
  passed the barrier of the great ranges.</p>

  <p>"So Perrault remained at Shangri-La, not exactly in defiance of superior
  orders, but because it was physically impossible for him to fulfill them. In
  any case he was an old man, and death would probably soon put an end both to
  him and his irregularity. By this time the institution he had founded had
  begun to undergo a subtle change. It might be deplorable, but it was not
  really very astonishing; for it could hardly be expected that one man unaided
  should uproot permanently the habits and traditions of an epoch. He had no
  Western colleagues to hold firm when his own grip relaxed; and it had perhaps
  been a mistake to build on a site that held such older and differing
  memories. It was asking too much; but was it not asking even more to expect a
  white-haired veteran, just entering the nineties, to realize the mistake that
  he had made? Perrault, at any rate, did not then realize it. He was far too
  old and happy. His followers were devoted even when they forgot his teaching,
  while the people of the valley held him in such reverent affection that he
  forgave with ever-increasing ease their lapse into former customs. He was
  still active, and his faculties had remained exceptionally keen. At the age
  of ninety-eight he began to study the Buddhist writings that had been left at
  Shangri-La by its previous occupants, and his intention was then to devote
  the rest of his life to the composition of a book attacking Buddhism from the
  standpoint of orthodoxy. He actually finished this task (we have his
  manuscript complete), but the attack was very gentle, for he had by that time
  reached the round figure of a century&mdash;an age at which even the keenest
  acrimonies are apt to fade.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, as you may suppose, many of his early disciples had died, and
  as there were few replacements, the number resident under the rule of the old
  Capuchin steadily diminished. From over eighty at one time, it dwindled to a
  score, and then to a mere dozen, most of them very aged themselves.
  Perrault's life at this time grew to be a very calm and placid waiting for
  the end. He was far too old for disease and discontent; only the everlasting
  sleep could claim him now, and he was not afraid. The valley people, out of
  kindness, supplied food and clothing; his library gave him work. He had
  become rather frail, but still kept energy to fulfill the major ceremonial of
  his office; the rest of the tranquil days he spent with his books, his
  memories, and the mild ecstasies of the narcotic. His mind remained so
  extraordinarily clear that he even embarked upon a study of certain mystic
  practices that the Indians call yoga, and which are based upon various
  special methods of breathing. For a man of such an age the enterprise might
  well have seemed hazardous, and it was certainly true that soon afterwards,
  in that memorable year 1789, news descended to the valley that Perrault was
  dying at last.</p>

  <p>"He lay in this room, my dear Conway, where he could see from the window
  the white blur that was all his failing eyesight gave him of Karakal; but he
  could see with his mind also; he could picture the clear and matchless
  outline that he had first glimpsed half a century before. And there came to
  him, too, the strange parade of all his many experiences, the years of travel
  across desert and upland, the great crowds in Western cities, the clang and
  glitter of Marlborough's troops. His mind had straitened to a snow-white
  calm; he was ready, willing, and glad to die. He gathered his friends and
  servants round him and bade them all farewell; then he asked to be left alone
  awhile. It was during such a solitude, with his body sinking and his mind
  lifted to beatitude, that he had hoped to give up his soul... but it did not
  happen so. He lay for many weeks without speech or movement, and then he
  began to recover. He was a hundred and eight."</p>

  <p>The whispering ceased for a moment, and to Conway, stirring slightly, it
  appeared that the High Lama had been translating, with fluency, out of a
  remote and private dream. At length he went on:</p>

  <p>"Like others who have waited long on the threshold of death, Perrault had
  been granted a vision of some significance to take back with him into the
  world; and of this vision more must be said later. Here I will confine myself
  to his actions and behavior, which were indeed remarkable. For instead of
  convalescing idly, as might have been expected, he plunged forthwith into
  rigorous self-discipline somewhat curiously combined with narcotic
  indulgence. Drug-taking and deep-breathing exercises&mdash;it could not have
  seemed a very death-defying regimen; yet the fact remains that when the last
  of the old monks died, in 1794, Perrault himself was still living.</p>

  <p>"It would almost have brought a smile had there been anyone at Shangri-La
  with a sufficiently distorted sense of humor. The wrinkled Capuchin, no more
  decrepit than he had been for a dozen years, persevered in a secret ritual he
  had evolved, while to the folk of the valley he soon became veiled in
  mystery, a hermit of uncanny powers who lived alone on that formidable cliff.
  But there was still a tradition of affection for him, and it came to be
  regarded as meritorious and luck-bringing to climb to Shangri-La and leave a
  simple gift, or perform some manual task that was needed there. On all such
  pilgrims Perrault bestowed his blessing&mdash;forgetful, it might be, that
  they were lost and straying sheep. For 'Te Deum Laudamus' and 'Om Mane Padme
  Hum' were now heard equally in the temples of the valley.</p>

  <p>"As the new century approached, the legend grew into a rich and fantastic
  folklore&mdash;it was said that Perrault had become a god, that he worked
  miracles, and that on certain nights he flew to the summit of Karakal to hold
  a candle to the sky. There is a paleness always on the mountain at full moon;
  but I need not assure you that neither Perrault or any other man has ever
  climbed there. I mention it, even though it may seem unnecessary, because
  there is a mass of unreliable testimony that Perrault did and could do all
  kinds of impossible things. It was supposed, for instance, that he practiced
  the art of self-levitation, of which so much appears in accounts of Buddhist
  mysticism; but the more sober truth is that he made many experiments to that
  end, but entirely without success. He did, however, discover that the
  impairment of ordinary senses could be somewhat offset by a development of
  others; he acquired skill in telepathy which was perhaps remarkable, and
  though he made no claim to any specific powers of healing, there was a
  quality in his mere presence that was helpful in certain cases.</p>

  <p>"You will wish to know how he spent his time during these unprecedented
  years. His attitude may be summed up by saying that, as he had not died at a
  normal age, he began to feel that there was no discoverable reason why he
  either should or should not do so at any definite time in the future. Having
  already proved himself abnormal, it was as easy to believe that the
  abnormality might continue as to expect it to end at any moment. And that
  being so, he began to behave without care for the imminence with which he had
  been so long preoccupied; he began to live the kind of life that he had
  always desired, but had so rarely found possible; for he had kept at heart
  and throughout all vicissitudes the tranquil tastes of a scholar. His memory
  was astonishing; it appeared to have escaped the trammels of the physical
  into some upper region of immense clarity; it almost seemed that he could now
  learn EVERYTHING with far greater ease than during his student days he had
  been able to learn ANYTHING. He was soon, of course, brought up against a
  need for books, but there were a few he had had with him from the first, and
  they included, you may be interested to hear, an English grammar and
  dictionary and Florio's translation of Montaigne. With these to work on he
  contrived to master the intricacies of your language, and we still possess in
  our library the manuscript of one of his first linguistic exercises&mdash;a
  translation of Montaigne's essay on Vanity into Tibetan&mdash;surely a unique
  production."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "I should be interested to see it sometime, if I
  might."</p>

  <p>"With the greatest of pleasure. It was, you may think, a singularly
  unpractical accomplishment, but recollect that Perrault had reached a
  singularly unpractical age. He would have been lonely without some such
  occupation&mdash;at any rate until the fourth year of the nineteenth century,
  which marks an important event in the history of our foundation. For it was
  then that a second stranger from Europe arrived in the valley of Blue Moon.
  He was a young Austrian named Henschell who had soldiered against Napoleon in
  Italy&mdash;a youth of noble birth, high culture, and much charm of manner.
  The wars had ruined his fortunes, and he had wandered across Russia into Asia
  with some vague intention of retrieving them. It would be interesting to know
  how exactly he reached the plateau, but he had no very clear idea himself;
  indeed, he was as near death when he arrived here as Perrault himself had
  once been. Again the hospitality of Shangri-La was extended, and the stranger
  recovered&mdash;but there the parallel breaks down. For Perrault had come to
  preach and proselytize, whereas Henschell took a more immediate interest in
  the gold deposits. His first ambition was to enrich himself and return to
  Europe as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"But he did not return. An odd thing happened&mdash;though one that has
  happened so often since that perhaps we must now agree that it cannot be very
  odd after all. The valley, with its peacefulness and its utter freedom from
  worldly cares, tempted him again and again to delay his departure, and one
  day, having heard the local legend, he climbed to Shangri-La and had his
  first meeting with Perrault.</p>

  <p>"That meeting was, in the truest sense, historic. Perrault, if a little
  beyond such human passions as friendship or affection, was yet endowed with a
  rich benignity of mind which touched the youth as water upon a parched soil.
  I will not try to describe the association that sprang up between the two;
  the one gave utmost adoration, while the other shared his knowledge, his
  ecstasies, and the wild dream that had now become the only reality left for
  him in the world."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and Conway said very quietly, "Pardon the interruption,
  but that is not quite clear to me."</p>

  <p>"I know." The whispered reply was completely sympathetic. "It would be
  remarkable indeed if it were. It is a matter which I shall be pleased to
  explain before our talk is over, but for the present, if you will forgive me,
  I will confine myself to simpler things. A fact that will interest you is
  that Henschell began our collections of Chinese art, as well as our library
  and musical acquisitions. He made a remarkable journey to Pekin and brought
  back the first consignment in the year 1809. He did not leave the valley
  again, but it was his ingenuity which devised the complicated system by which
  the lamasery has ever since been able to obtain anything needful from the
  outer world."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you found it easy to make payment in gold?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have been fortunate in possessing supplies of a metal which is
  held in such high esteem in other parts of the world."</p>

  <p>"Such high esteem that you must have been very lucky to escape a gold
  rush."</p>

  <p>The High Lama inclined his head in the merest indication of agreement.
  "That, my dear Conway, was always Henschell's fear. He was careful that none
  of the porters bringing books and art treasures should ever approach too
  closely; he made them leave their burdens a day's journey outside, to be
  fetched afterwards by our valley folk themselves. He even arranged for
  sentries to keep constant watch on the entrance to the defile. But it soon
  occurred to him that there was an easier and more final safeguard."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Conway's voice was guardedly tense.</p>

  <p>"You see there was no need to fear invasion by an army. That will never be
  possible, owing to the nature and distances of the country. The most ever to
  be expected was the arrival of a few half-lost wanderers who, even if they
  were armed, would probably be so weakened as to constitute no danger. It was
  decided, therefore, that henceforward strangers might come as freely as they
  chose&mdash;with but one important proviso.</p>

  <p>"And, over a period of years, such strangers did come. Chinese merchants,
  tempted into the crossing of the plateau, chanced occasionally on this one
  traverse out of so many others possible to them. Nomad Tibetans, wandering
  from their tribes, strayed here sometimes like weary animals. All were made
  welcome, though some reached the shelter of the valley only to die. In the
  year of Waterloo two English missionaries, traveling overland to Pekin,
  crossed the ranges by an unnamed pass and had the extraordinary luck to
  arrive as calmly as if they were paying a call. In 1820 a Greek trader,
  accompanied by sick and famished servants, was found dying at the topmost
  ridge of the pass. In 1822 three Spaniards, having heard some vague story of
  gold, reached here after many wanderings and disappointments. Again, in 1830,
  there was a larger influx. Two Germans, a Russian, an Englishman, and a Swede
  made the dreaded crossing of the Tian-Shans, impelled by a motive that was to
  become increasingly common&mdash;scientific exploration. By the time of their
  approach a slight modification had taken place in the attitude of Shangri-La
  towards its visitors&mdash;not only were they welcomed if they chanced to
  find their way into the valley, but it had become customary to meet them if
  they ever ventured within a certain radius. All this was for a reason I shall
  later discuss, but the point is of importance as showing that the lamasery
  was no longer hospitably indifferent; it had already both a need and a desire
  for new arrivals. And indeed in the years to follow it happened that more
  than one party of explorers, glorying in their first distant glimpse of
  Karakal, encountered messengers bearing a cordial invitation &mdash;and one
  that was rarely declined.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile the lamasery had begun to acquire many of its present
  characteristics. I must stress the fact that Henschell was exceedingly able
  and talented, and that the Shangri-La of today owes as much to him as to its
  founder. Yes, quite as much, I often think. For his was the firm yet kindly
  hand that every institution needs at a certain stage of its development, and
  his loss would have been altogether irreparable had he not completed more
  than a lifework before he died."</p>

  <p>Conway looked up to echo rather than question those final words. "He
  DIED!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was very sudden. He was killed. It was in the year of your Indian
  Mutiny. Just before his death a Chinese artist had sketched him, and I can
  show you that sketch now&mdash;it is in this room."</p>

  <p>The slight gesture of the hand was repeated, and once again a servant
  entered. Conway, as a spectator in a trance, watched the man withdraw a small
  curtain at the far end of the room and leave a lantern swinging amongst the
  shadows. Then he heard the whisper inviting him to move, and it was
  extraordinary how hard it was to do so.</p>

  <p>He stumbled to his feet and strode across to the trembling circle of
  light. The sketch was small, hardly more than a miniature in colored inks,
  but the artist had contrived to give the flesh tones a waxwork delicacy of
  texture. The features were of great beauty, almost girlish in modeling, and
  Conway found in their winsomeness a curiously personal appeal, even across
  the barriers of time, death, and artifice. But the strangest thing of all was
  one that he realized only after his first gasp of admiration: the face was
  that of a young man.</p>

  <p>He stammered as he moved away: "But&mdash;you said&mdash;this was done
  just before his death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is a very good likeness."</p>

  <p>"Then if he died in the year you said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He did."</p>

  <p>"And he came here, you told me, in 1803, when he was a youth."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Conway did not answer for a moment; presently, with an effort, he
  collected himself to say: "And he was killed, you were telling me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. An Englishman shot him. It was a few weeks after the Englishman had
  arrived at Shangri-La. He was another of those explorers."</p>

  <p>"What was the cause of it?"</p>

  <p>"There had been a quarrel&mdash;about some porters. Henschell had just
  told him of the important proviso that governs our reception of guests. It
  was a task of some difficulty, and ever since, despite my own enfeeblement, I
  have felt constrained to perform it myself."</p>

  <p>The High Lama made another and longer pause, with just a hint of enquiry
  in his silence; when he continued, it was to add: "Perhaps you are wondering,
  my dear Conway, what that proviso may be?"</p>

  <p>Conway answered slowly and in a low voice: "I think I can already
  guess."</p>

  <p>"Can you indeed? And can you guess anything else after this long and
  curious story of mine?"</p>

  <p>Conway dizzied in brain as he sought to answer the question; the room was
  now a whorl of shadows with that ancient benignity at its center. Throughout
  the narrative he had listened with an intentness that had perhaps shielded
  him from realizing the fullest implications of it all; now, with the mere
  attempt at conscious expression, he was flooded over with amazement, and the
  gathering certainty in his mind was almost stifled as it sprang to words. "It
  seems impossible," he stammered. "And yet I can't help thinking of
  it&mdash;it's astonishing&mdash;and extraordinary&mdash;and quite incredible
  &mdash;and yet not ABSOLUTELY beyond my powers of belief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is, my SON?"</p>

  <p>And Conway answered, shaken with an emotion for which he knew no reason
  and which he did not seek to conceal: "THAT YOU ARE STILL ALIVE, FATHER
  PERRAULT."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There had been a pause, imposed by the High Lama's call for
  further refreshment; Conway did not wonder at it, for the strain of such a
  long recital must have been considerable. Nor was he himself ungrateful for
  the respite. He felt that the interval was as desirable from an artistic as
  from any other point of view, and that the bowls of tea, with their
  accompaniment of conventionally improvised courtesies, fulfilled the same
  function as a cadenza in music. This reflection brought out (unless it were
  mere coincidence) an odd example of the High Lama's telepathic powers, for he
  immediately began to talk about music and to express pleasure that Conway's
  taste in that direction had not been entirely unsatisfied at Shangri-La.
  Conway answered with suitable politeness and added that he had been surprised
  to find the lamasery in possession of such a complete library of European
  composers. The compliment was acknowledged between slow sips of tea. "Ah, my
  dear Conway, we are fortunate in that one of our number is a gifted musician
  &mdash;he was, indeed, a pupil of Chopin's&mdash;and we have been happy to
  place in his hands the entire management of our salon. You must certainly
  meet him."</p>

  <p>"I should like to. Chang, by the way, was telling me that your favorite
  Western composer is Mozart."</p>

  <p>"That is so," came the reply. "Mozart has an austere elegance which we
  find very satisfying. He builds a house which is neither too big nor too
  little, and he furnishes it in perfect taste."</p>

  <p>The exchange of comments continued until the tea bowls were taken away; by
  that time Conway was able to remark quite calmly: "So, to resume our earlier
  discussion, you intend to keep us? That, I take it, is the important and
  invariable proviso?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed correctly, my son."</p>

  <p>"In other words, we are to stay here forever?"</p>

  <p>"I should greatly prefer to employ your excellent English idiom and say
  that we are all of us here 'for good.'"</p>

  <p>"What puzzles me is why we four, out of all the rest of the world's
  inhabitants, should have been chosen."</p>

  <p>Relapsing into his earlier and more consequential manner, the High Lama
  responded: "It is an intricate story, if you would care to hear it. You must
  know that we have always aimed, as far as possible, to keep our numbers in
  fairly constant recruitment&mdash;since, apart from any other reasons, it is
  pleasant to have with us people of various ages and representative of
  different periods. Unfortunately, since the recent European War and the
  Russian Revolution, travel and exploration in Tibet have been almost
  completely held up; in fact, our last visitor, a Japanese, arrived in 1912,
  and was not, to be candid, a very valuable acquisition. You see, my dear
  Conway, we are not quacks or charlatans; we do not and cannot guarantee
  success; some of our visitors derive no benefit at all from their stay here;
  others merely live to what might be called a normally advanced age and then
  die from some trifling ailment. In general we have found that Tibetans, owing
  to their being inured to both the altitude and other conditions, are much
  less sensitive than outside races; they are charming people, and we have
  admitted many of them, but I doubt if more than a few will pass their
  hundredth year. The Chinese are a little better, but even among them we have
  a high percentage of failures. Our best subjects, undoubtedly, are the Nordic
  and Latin races of Europe; perhaps the Americans would be equally adaptable,
  and I count it our great good fortune that we have at last, in the person of
  one of your companions, secured a citizen of that nation. But I must continue
  with the answer to your question. The position was, as I have been
  explaining, that for nearly two decades we had welcomed no newcomers, and as
  there had been several deaths during that period, a problem was beginning to
  arise. A few years ago, however, one of our number came to the rescue with a
  novel idea; he was a young fellow, a native of our valley, absolutely
  trustworthy and in fullest sympathy with our aims; but, like all the valley
  people, he was denied by nature the chance that comes more fortunately to
  those from a distance. It was he who suggested that he should leave us, make
  his way to some surrounding country, and bring us additional colleagues by a
  method which would have been impossible in an earlier age. It was in many
  respects a revolutionary proposal, but we gave our consent after due
  consideration. For we must move with the times, you know, even at
  Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he was sent out deliberately to bring someone back by
  air?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, he was an exceedingly gifted and resourceful youth, and we
  had great confidence in him. It was his own idea, and we allowed him a free
  hand in carrying it out. All we knew definitely was that the first stage of
  his plan included a period of tuition at an American flying school."</p>

  <p>"But how could he manage the rest of it? It was only by chance that there
  happened to be that aeroplane at Baskul&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"True, my dear Conway&mdash;many things are by chance. But it happened,
  after all, to be just the chance that Talu was looking for. Had he not found
  it, there might have been another chance in a year or two&mdash;or perhaps,
  of course, none at all. I confess I was surprised when our sentinels gave
  news of his descent on the plateau. The progress of aviation is rapid, but it
  had seemed likely to me that much more time would elapse before an average
  machine could make such a crossing of the mountains."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't an average machine. It was a rather special one, made for
  mountain flying."</p>

  <p>"Again by chance? Our young friend was indeed fortunate. It is a pity that
  we cannot discuss the matter with him&mdash;we were all grieved at his death.
  You would have liked him, Conway."</p>

  <p>Conway nodded slightly; he felt it very possible. He said, after a
  silence: "But what's the idea behind it all?"</p>

  <p>"My son, your way of asking that question gives me infinite pleasure. In
  the course of a somewhat long experience it has never before been put to me
  in tones of such calmness. My revelation has been greeted in almost every
  conceivable manner&mdash;with indignation, distress, fury, disbelief, and
  hysteria&mdash;but never until this night with mere interest. It is, however,
  an attitude that I most cordially welcome. Today you are interested; tomorrow
  you will feel concern; eventually, it may be, I shall claim your
  devotion."</p>

  <p>"That is more than I should care to promise."</p>

  <p>"Your very doubt pleases me&mdash;it is the basis of profound and
  significant faith... But let us not argue. You are interested, and that, from
  you, is much. All I ask in addition is that what I tell you now shall remain,
  for the present, unknown to your three companions."</p>

  <p>Conway was silent.</p>

  <p>"The time will come when they will learn, like you, but that moment, for
  their own sakes, had better not be hastened. I am so certain of your wisdom
  in this matter that I do not ask for a promise; you will act, I know, as we
  both think best... Now let me begin by sketching for you a very agreeable
  picture. You are still, I should say, a youngish man by the world's
  standards; your life, as people say, lies ahead of you; in the normal course
  you might expect twenty or thirty years of only slightly and gradually
  diminishing activity. By no means a cheerless prospect, and I can hardly
  expect you to see it as I do&mdash;as a slender, breathless, and far too
  frantic interlude. The first quarter-century of your life was doubtless lived
  under the cloud of being too young for things, while the last quarter-century
  would normally be shadowed by the still darker cloud of being too old for
  them; and between those two clouds, what small and narrow sunlight illumines
  a human lifetime! But you, it may be, are destined to be more fortunate,
  since by the standards of Shangri-La your sunlit years have scarcely yet
  begun. It will happen, perhaps, that decades hence you will feel no older
  than you are today&mdash;you may preserve, as Henschell did, a long and
  wondrous youth. But that, believe me, is only an early and superficial phase.
  There will come a time when you will age like others, though far more slowly,
  and into a condition infinitely nobler; at eighty you may still climb to the
  pass with a young man's gait, but at twice that age you must not expect the
  whole marvel to have persisted. We are not workers of miracles; we have made
  no conquest of death or even of decay. All we have done and can sometimes do
  is to slacken the tempo of this brief interval that is called life. We do
  this by methods which are as simple here as they are impossible elsewhere;
  but make no mistake; the end awaits us all.</p>

  <p>"Yet it is, nevertheless, a prospect of much charm that I unfold for you
  &mdash;long tranquillities during which you will observe a sunset as men in
  the outer world hear the striking of a clock, and with far less care. The
  years will come and go, and you will pass from fleshly enjoyments into
  austerer but no less satisfying realms; you may lose the keenness of muscle
  and appetite, but there will be gain to match your loss; you will achieve
  calmness and profundity, ripeness and wisdom, and the clear enchantment of
  memory. And, most precious of all, you will have Time&mdash;that rare and
  lovely gift that your Western countries have lost the more they have pursued
  it. Think for a moment. You will have time to read&mdash;never again will you
  skim pages to save minutes, or avoid some study lest it prove too engrossing.
  You have also a taste for music&mdash;here, then, are your scores and
  instruments, with Time, unruffled and unmeasured to give you their richest
  savor. And you are also, we will say, a man of good fellowship &mdash;does it
  not charm you to think of wise and serene friendships, a long and kindly
  traffic of the mind from which death may not call you away with his customary
  hurry? Or, if it is solitude that you prefer, could you not employ our
  pavilions to enrich the gentleness of lonely thoughts?"</p>

  <p>The voice made a pause which Conway did not seek to fill.</p>

  <p>"You make no comment, my dear Conway. Forgive my eloquence&mdash;I belong
  to an age and a nation that never considered it bad form to be articulate...
  But perhaps you are thinking of wife, parents, children, left behind in the
  world? Or maybe ambitions to do this or that? Believe me, though the pang may
  be keen at first, in a decade from now even its ghost will not haunt you.
  Though in point of fact, if I read your mind correctly, you have no such
  griefs."</p>

  <p>Conway was startled by the accuracy of the judgment. "That's so," he
  replied. "I'm unmarried; I have few close friends and no ambitions."</p>

  <p>"No ambitions? And how have you contrived to escape those widespread
  maladies?"</p>

  <p>For the first time Conway felt that he was actually taking part in a
  conversation. He said: "It always seemed to me in my profession that a good
  deal of what passed for success would be rather disagreeable, apart from
  needing more effort than I felt called upon to make. I was in the Consular
  Service&mdash;quite a subordinate post, but it suited me well enough."</p>

  <p>"Yet your soul was not in it?"</p>

  <p>"Neither my soul nor my heart nor more than half my energies. I'm
  naturally rather lazy."</p>

  <p>The wrinkles deepened and twisted till Conway realized that the High Lama
  was very probably smiling. "Laziness in doing stupid things can be a great
  virtue," resumed the whisper. "In any case, you will scarcely find us
  exacting in such a matter. Chang, I believe, explained to you our principle
  of moderation, and one of the things in which we are always moderate is
  activity. I myself, for instance, have been able to learn ten languages; the
  ten might have been twenty had I worked immoderately. But I did not. And it
  is the same in other directions; you will find us neither profligate nor
  ascetic. Until we reach an age when care is advisable, we gladly accept the
  pleasures of the table, while&mdash;for the benefit of our younger
  colleagues&mdash;the women of the valley have happily applied the principle
  of moderation to their own chastity. All things considered, I feel sure you
  will get used to our ways without much effort. Chang, indeed, was very
  optimistic&mdash;and so, after this meeting, am I. But there is, I admit, an
  odd quality in you that I have never met in any of our visitors hitherto. It
  is not quite cynicism, still less bitterness; perhaps it is partly
  disillusionment, but it is also a clarity of mind that I should not have
  expected in anyone younger than&mdash;say, a century or so. It is, if I had
  to put a single word to it, passionlessness."</p>

  <p>Conway answered: "As good a word as most, no doubt. I don't know whether
  you classify the people who come here, but if so, you can label me '1914-18.'
  That makes me, I should think, a unique specimen in your museum of
  antiquities&mdash;the other three who arrived along with me don't enter the
  category. I used up most of my passions and energies during the years I've
  mentioned, and though I don't talk much about it, the chief thing I've asked
  from the world since then is to leave me alone. I find in this place a
  certain charm and quietness that appeals to me, and no doubt, as you remark,
  I shall get used to things."</p>

  <p>"Is that all, my son?"</p>

  <p>"I hope I am keeping well to your own rule of moderation."</p>

  <p>"You are clever&mdash;as Chang told me, you are very clever. But is there
  nothing in the prospect I have outlined that tempts you to any stronger
  feeling?"</p>

  <p>Conway was silent for an interval and then replied: "I was deeply
  impressed by your story of the past, but to be candid, your sketch of the
  future interests me only in an abstract sense. I can't look so far ahead. I
  should certainly be sorry if I had to leave Shangri-La tomorrow or next week,
  or perhaps even next year; but how I shall feel about it if I live to be a
  hundred isn't a matter to prophesy. I can face it, like any other future, but
  in order to make me keen it must have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether
  life itself has any; and if not, long life must be even more pointless."</p>

  <p>"My friend, the traditions of this building, both Buddhist and Christian,
  are very reassuring."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But I'm afraid I still hanker after some more definite reason for
  envying the centenarian."</p>

  <p>"There IS a reason, and a very definite one indeed. It is the whole reason
  for this colony of chance-sought strangers living beyond their years. We do
  not follow an idle experiment, a mere whimsy. We have a dream and a vision.
  It is a vision that first appeared to old Perrault when he lay dying in this
  room in the year 1789. He looked back then on his long life, as I have
  already told you, and it seemed to him that all the loveliest things were
  transient and perishable, and that war, lust, and brutality might someday
  crush them until there were no more left in the world. He remembered sights
  he had seen with his own eyes, and with his mind he pictured others; he saw
  the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in vulgar passions and the will
  to destroy; he saw their machine power multiplying until a single-weaponed
  man might have matched a whole army of the Grand Monarque. And he perceived
  that when they had filled the land and sea with ruin, they would take to the
  air... Can you say that his vision was untrue?"</p>

  <p>"True indeed."</p>

  <p>"But that was not all. He foresaw a time when men, exultant in the
  technique of homicide, would rage so hotly over the world that every precious
  thing would be in danger, every book and picture and harmony, every treasure
  garnered through two millenniums, the small, the delicate, the defenseless
  &mdash;all would be lost like the lost books of Livy, or wrecked as the
  English wrecked the Summer Palace in Pekin."</p>

  <p>"I share your opinion of that."</p>

  <p>"Of course. But what are the opinions of reasonable men against iron and
  steel? Believe me, that vision of old Perrault will come true. And that, my
  son, is why I am here, and why YOU are here, and why we may pray to outlive
  the doom that gathers around on every side."</p>

  <p>"To outlive it?"</p>

  <p>"There is a chance. It will all come to pass before you are as old as I
  am."</p>

  <p>"And you think that Shangri-La will escape?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. We may expect no mercy, but we may faintly hope for neglect.
  Here we shall stay with our books and our music and our meditations,
  conserving the frail elegancies of a dying age, and seeking such wisdom as
  men will need when their passions are all spent. We have a heritage to
  cherish and bequeath. Let us take what pleasure we may until that time
  comes."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian
  ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth."</p>

  <p>A shadow of emphasis had touched the whisper, and Conway surrendered to
  the beauty of it; again he felt the surge of darkness around, but now
  symbolically, as if the world outside were already brewing for the storm. And
  then he saw that the High Lama of Shangri-La was actually astir, rising from
  his chair, standing upright like the half-embodiment of a ghost. In mere
  politeness Conway made to assist; but suddenly a deeper impulse seized him,
  and he did what he had never done to any man before; he knelt, and hardly
  knew why he did.</p>

  <p>"I understand you, Father," he said.</p>

  <p>He was not perfectly aware of how at last he took his leave; he was in a
  dream from which he did not emerge till long afterwards. He remembered the
  night air icy after the heat of those upper rooms, and Chang's presence, a
  silent serenity, as they crossed the starlit courtyards together. Never had
  Shangri-La offered more concentrated loveliness to his eyes; the valley lay
  imaged over the edge of the cliff, and the image was of a deep unrippled pool
  that matched the peace of his own thoughts. For Conway had passed beyond
  astonishments. The long talk, with its varying phases, had left him empty of
  all save a satisfaction that was as much of the mind as of the emotions, and
  as much of the spirit as of either; even his doubts were now no longer
  harassing, but part of a subtle harmony. Chang did not speak, and neither did
  he. It was very late, and he was glad that all the others had gone to
  bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the morning he wondered if all that he could call to mind
  were part of a waking or a sleeping vision.</p>

  <p>He was soon reminded. A chorus of questions greeted him when he appeared
  at breakfast. "You certainly had a long talk with the boss last night," began
  the American. "We meant to wait up for you, but we got tired. What sort of a
  guy is he?"</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything about the porters?" asked Mallinson eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I hope you mentioned to him about having a missionary stationed here,"
  said Miss Brinklow.</p>

  <p>The bombardment served to raise in Conway his usual defensive armament.
  "I'm afraid I'm probably going to disappoint you all," he replied, slipping
  easily into the mood. "I didn't discuss with him the question of missions; he
  didn't mention the porters to me at all; and as for his appearance, I can
  only say that he's a very old man who speaks excellent English and is quite
  intelligent."</p>

  <p>Mallinson cut in with irritation: "The main thing to us is whether he's to
  be trusted or not. Do you think he means to let us down?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't strike me as a dishonorable person."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth didn't you worry him about the porters?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't occur to me."</p>

  <p>Mallinson stared at him incredulously. "I can't understand you, Conway.
  You were so damned good in that Baskul affair that I can hardly believe
  you're the same man. You seem to have gone all to pieces."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"No good being sorry. You ought to buck up and look as if you cared what
  happens."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me. I meant that I was sorry to have disappointed
  you."</p>

  <p>Conway's voice was curt, an intended mask to his feelings, which were,
  indeed, so mixed that they could hardly have been guessed by others. He had
  slightly surprised himself by the ease with which he had prevaricated; it was
  clear that he intended to observe the High Lama's suggestion and keep the
  secret. He was also puzzled by the naturalness with which he was accepting a
  position which his companions would certainly and with some justification
  think traitorous; as Mallinson had said, it was hardly the sort of thing to
  be expected of a hero. Conway felt a sudden half-pitying fondness for the
  youth; then he steeled himself by reflecting that people who hero-worship
  must be prepared for disillusionments. Mallinson at Baskul had been far too
  much the new boy adoring the handsome games captain, and now the games
  captain was tottering if not already fallen from the pedestal. There was
  always something a little pathetic in the smashing of an ideal, however
  false; and Mallinson's admiration might have been at least a partial solace
  for the strain of pretending to be what he was not. But pretense was
  impossible anyway. There was a quality in the air of Shangri-La&mdash;perhaps
  due to its altitude&mdash;that forbade one the effort of counterfeit
  emotion.</p>

  <p>He said: "Look here, Mallinson, it's no use harping continually on Baskul.
  Of course I was different then&mdash;it was a completely different
  situation."</p>

  <p>"And a much healthier one in my opinion. At least we knew what we were up
  against."</p>

  <p>"Murder and rape&mdash;to be precise. You can call that healthier if you
  like."</p>

  <p>The youth's voice rose in pitch as he retorted: "Well, I DO call it
  healthier&mdash;in one sense. It's something I'd rather face than all this
  mystery business." Suddenly he added: "That Chinese girl, for instance
  &mdash;how did SHE get here? Did the fellow tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Why should he?"</p>

  <p>"Well, why shouldn't he? And why shouldn't you ask, if you had any
  interest in the matter at all? Is it usual to find a young girl living with a
  lot of monks?"</p>

  <p>That way of looking at it was one that had scarcely occurred to Conway
  before. "This isn't an ordinary monastery," was the best reply he could give
  after some thought.</p>

  <p>"My God, it isn't!"</p>

  <p>There was a silence, for the argument had evidently reached a dead end. To
  Conway the history of Lo-Tsen seemed rather far from the point; the little
  Manchu lay so quietly in his mind that he hardly knew she was there. But at
  the mere mention of her Miss Brinklow had looked up suddenly from the Tibetan
  grammar which she was studying even over the breakfast table (just as if,
  thought Conway, with secret meaning, she hadn't all her life for it). Chatter
  of girls and monks reminded her of those stories of Indian temples that men
  missionaries told their wives, and that the wives passed on to their
  unmarried female colleagues. "Of course," she said between tightened lips,
  "the morals of this place are quite hideous&mdash;we might have expected
  that." She turned to Barnard as if inviting support, but the American only
  grinned. "I don't suppose you folks'd value my opinion on a matter of
  morals," he remarked dryly. "But I should say myself that quarrels are just
  as bad. Since we've gotter be here for some time yet, let's keep our tempers
  and make ourselves comfortable."</p>

  <p>Conway thought this good advice, but Mallinson was still unplacated. "I
  can quite believe you find it more comfortable than Dartmoor," he said
  meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Dartmoor? Oh, that's your big penitentiary?&mdash;I get you. Well, yes, I
  certainly never did envy the folks in them places. And there's another thing
  too&mdash;it don't hurt when you chip me about it. Thick-skinned and
  tenderhearted, that's my mixture."</p>

  <p>Conway glanced at him in appreciation, and at Mallinson with some hint of
  reproof; but then abruptly he had the feeling that they were all acting on a
  vast stage, of whose background only he himself was conscious; and such
  knowledge, so incommunicable, made him suddenly want to be alone. He nodded
  to them and went out into the courtyard. In sight of Karakal misgivings
  faded, and qualms about his three companions were lost in an uncanny
  acceptance of the new world that lay so far beyond their guesses. There came
  a time, he realized, when the strangeness of everything made it increasingly
  difficult to realize the strangeness of anything; when one took things for
  granted merely because astonishment would have been as tedious for oneself as
  for others. Thus far had he progressed at Shangri-La, and he remembered that
  he had attained a similar though far less pleasant equanimity during his
  years at the War.</p>

  <p>He needed equanimity, if only to accommodate himself to the double life he
  was compelled to lead. Thenceforward, with his fellow exiles, he lived in a
  world conditioned by the arrival of porters and a return to India; at all
  other times the horizon lifted like a curtain; time expanded and space
  contracted and the name Blue Moon took on a symbolic meaning, as if the
  future, so delicately plausible, were of a kind that might happen once in a
  blue moon only. Sometimes he wondered which of his two lives were the more
  real, but the problem was not pressing; and again he was reminded of the War,
  for during heavy bombardments he had had the same comforting sensation that
  he had many lives, only one of which could be claimed by death.</p>

  <p>Chang, of course, now talked to him completely without reserve, and they
  had many conversations about the rule and routine of the lamasery. Conway
  learned that during his first five years he would live a normal life, without
  any special regimen; this was always done, as Chang said, "to enable the body
  to accustom itself to the altitude, and also to give time for the dispersal
  of mental and emotional regrets."</p>

  <p>Conway remarked with a smile: "I suppose you're certain, then, that no
  human affection can outlast a five-year absence?"</p>

  <p>"It can, undoubtedly," replied the Chinese, "but only as a fragrance whose
  melancholy we may enjoy."</p>

  <p>After the probationary five years, Chang went on to explain, the process
  of retarding age would begin, and if successful, might give Conway half a
  century or so at the apparent age of forty&mdash;which was not a bad time of
  life at which to remain stationary.</p>

  <p>"What about yourself?" Conway asked. "How did it work out in your
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear sir, I was lucky enough to arrive when I was quite young
  &mdash;only twenty-two. I was a soldier, though you might not have thought
  it; I had command of troops operating against brigand tribes in the year
  1855. I was making what I should have called a reconnaissance if I had ever
  returned to my superior officers to tell the tale, but in plain truth I had
  lost my way in the mountains, and of my men only seven out of over a hundred
  survived the rigors of the climate. When at last I was rescued and brought to
  Shangri-La I was so ill that extreme youth and virility alone could have
  saved me."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two," echoed Conway, performing the calculation. "So you're now
  ninety-seven?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Very soon, if the lamas give their consent, I shall receive full
  initiation."</p>

  <p>"I see. You have to wait for the round figure?"</p>

  <p>"No, we are not restricted by any definite age limit, but a century is
  generally considered to be an age beyond which the passions and moods of
  ordinary life are likely to have disappeared."</p>

  <p>"I should certainly think so. And what happens afterwards? How long do you
  expect to carry on?"</p>

  <p>"There is reason to hope that I shall enter lamahood with such prospects
  as Shangri-La has made possible. In years, perhaps another century or
  more."</p>

  <p>Conway nodded. "I don't know whether I ought to congratulate you&mdash;you
  seem to have been granted the best of both worlds, a long and pleasant youth
  behind you, and an equally long and pleasant old age ahead. When did you
  begin to grow old in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"When I was over seventy. That is often the case, though I think I may
  still claim to look younger than my years."</p>

  <p>"Decidedly. And suppose you were to leave the valley now, what would
  happen?"</p>

  <p>"Death, if I remained away for more than a very few days."</p>

  <p>"The atmosphere, then, is essential?"</p>

  <p>"There is only one valley of Blue Moon, and those who expect to find
  another are asking too much of nature."</p>

  <p>"Well, what would have happened if you had left the valley, say, thirty
  years ago, during your prolonged youth?"</p>

  <p>Chang answered: "Probably I should have died even then. In any case, I
  should have acquired very quickly the full appearance of my actual age. We
  had a curious example of that some years ago, though there had been several
  others before. One of our number had left the valley to look out for a party
  of travelers who we had heard might be approaching. This man, a Russian, had
  arrived here originally in the prime of life, and had taken to our ways so
  well that at nearly eighty he did not look more than half as old. He should
  have been absent no longer than a week (which would not have mattered), but
  unfortunately he was taken prisoner by nomad tribes and carried away some
  distance. We suspected an accident and gave him up for lost. Three months
  later, however, he returned to us, having made his escape. But he was a very
  different man. Every year of his age was in his face and behavior, and he
  died shortly afterwards, as an old man dies."</p>

  <p>Conway made no remark for some time. They were talking in the library, and
  during most of the narrative he had been gazing through a window towards the
  pass that led to the outer world; a little wisp of cloud had drifted across
  the ridge. "A rather grim story, Chang," he commented at length. "It gives
  one the feeling that Time is like some balked monster, waiting outside the
  valley to pounce on the slackers who have managed to evade him longer than
  they should."</p>

  <p>"SLACKERS?" queried Chang. His knowledge of English was extremely good,
  but sometimes a colloquialism proved unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"'Slacker,'" explained Conway, "is a slang word meaning a lazy fellow, a
  good-for-nothing. I wasn't, of course, using it seriously."</p>

  <p>Chang bowed his thanks for the information. He took a keen interest in
  languages and liked to weigh a new word philosophically. "It is significant,"
  he said after a pause, "that the English regard slackness as a vice. We, on
  the other hand, should vastly prefer it to tension. Is there not too much
  tension in the world at present, and might it not be better if more people
  were slackers?"</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to agree with you," Conway answered with solemn
  amusement.</p>

  <p>During the course of a week or so after the interview with the High Lama,
  Conway met several others of his future colleagues. Chang was neither eager
  nor reluctant to make the introductions, and Conway sensed a new and, to him,
  rather attractive atmosphere in which urgency did not clamor nor postponement
  disappoint. "Indeed," as Chang explained, "some of the lamas may not meet you
  for a considerable time&mdash;perhaps years&mdash;but you must not be
  surprised at that. They are prepared to make your acquaintance when it may so
  happen, and their avoidance of hurry does not imply any degree of
  unwillingness." Conway, who had often had similar feelings when calling on
  new arrivals at foreign consulates, thought it a very intelligible
  attitude.</p>

  <p>The meetings he did have, however, were quite successful, and conversation
  with men thrice his age held none of the social embarrassments that might
  have obtruded in London or Delhi. His first encounter was with a genial
  German named Meister, who had entered the lamasery during the 'eighties, as
  the survivor of an exploring party. He spoke English well, though with an
  accent. A day or two later a second introduction took place, and Conway
  enjoyed his first talk with the man whom the High Lama had particularly
  mentioned&mdash;Alphonse Briac, a wiry, small-statured Frenchman who did not
  look especially old, though he announced himself as a pupil of Chopin. Conway
  thought that both he and the German would prove agreeable company. Already he
  was subconsciously analyzing, and after a few further meetings he reached one
  or two general conclusions; he perceived that though the lamas he met had
  individual differences, they all possessed that quality for which agelessness
  was not an outstandingly good name, but the only one he could think of.
  Moreover, they were all endowed with a calm intelligence which pleasantly
  overflowed into measured and well-balanced opinions. Conway could give an
  exact response to that kind of approach, and he was aware that they realized
  it and were gratified. He found them quite as easy to get on with as any
  other group of cultured people he might have met, though there was often a
  sense of oddity in hearing reminiscences so distant and apparently so casual.
  One white-haired and benevolent-looking person, for instance, asked Conway,
  after a little conversation, if he were interested in the Brontës. Conway
  said he was, to some extent, and the other replied: "You see, when I was a
  curate in the West Riding during the 'forties, I once visited Haworth and
  stayed at the Parsonage. Since coming here I've made a study of the whole
  Brontë problem&mdash;indeed, I'm writing a book on the subject. Perhaps you
  might care to go over it with me sometime?"</p>

  <p>Conway responded cordially, and afterwards, when he and Chang were left
  together, commented on the vividness with which the lamas appeared to
  recollect their pre-Tibetan lives. Chang answered that it was all part of the
  training. "You see, my dear sir, one of the first steps toward the clarifying
  of the mind is to obtain a panorama of one's own past, and that, like any
  other view, is more accurate in perspective. When you have been among us long
  enough you will find your old life slipping gradually into focus as through a
  telescope when the lens is adjusted. Everything will stand out still and
  clear, duly proportioned and with its correct significance. Your new
  acquaintance, for instance, discerns that the really big moment of his entire
  life occurred when he was a young man visiting a house in which there lived
  an old parson and his three daughters."</p>

  <p>"So I suppose I shall have to set to work to remember my own big
  moments?"</p>

  <p>"It will not be an effort. They will come to you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I shall give them much of a welcome," answered Conway
  moodily.</p>

  <p>But whatever the past might yield, he was discovering happiness in the
  present. When he sat reading in the library, or playing Mozart in the music
  room, he often felt the invasion of a deep spiritual emotion, as if
  Shangri-La were indeed a living essence, distilled from the magic of the ages
  and miraculously preserved against time and death. His talk with the High
  Lama recurred memorably at such moments; he sensed a calm intelligence
  brooding gently over every diversion, giving a thousand whispered
  reassurances to ear and eye. Thus he would listen while Lo-Tsen marshaled
  some intricate fugue rhythm, and wonder what lay behind the faint impersonal
  smile that stirred her lips into the likeness of an opening flower. She
  talked very little, even though she now knew that Conway could speak her
  language; to Mallinson, who liked to visit the music room sometimes, she was
  almost dumb. But Conway discerned a charm that was perfectly expressed by her
  silences.</p>

  <p>Once he asked Chang her history, and learned that she came of royal Manchu
  stock. "She was betrothed to a prince of Turkestan, and was traveling to
  Kashgar to meet him when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The
  whole party would doubtless have perished but for the customary meeting with
  our emissaries."</p>

  <p>"When did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"In 1884. She was eighteen."</p>

  <p>"Eighteen THEN?"</p>

  <p>Chang bowed. "Yes, we are succeeding very well with her, as you may judge
  for yourself. Her progress has been consistently excellent."</p>

  <p>"How did she take things when she first came?"</p>

  <p>"She was, perhaps, a little more than averagely reluctant to accept the
  situation&mdash;she made no protest, but we were aware that she was troubled
  for a time. It was, of course, an unusual occurrence&mdash;to intercept a
  young girl on the way to her wedding... We were all particularly anxious that
  she should be happy here." Chang smiled blandly. "I am afraid the excitement
  of love does not make for an easy surrender, though the first five years
  proved ample for their purpose."</p>

  <p>"She was deeply attached, I suppose, to the man she was to have
  married?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly that, my dear sir, since she had never seen him. It was the old
  custom, you know. The excitement of her affections was entirely
  impersonal."</p>

  <p>Conway nodded, and thought a little tenderly of Lo-Tsen. He pictured her
  as she might have been half a century before, statuesque in her decorated
  chair as the carriers toiled over the plateau, her eyes searching the
  windswept horizons that must have seemed so harsh after the gardens and lotus
  pools of the East. "Poor child!" he said, thinking of such elegance held
  captive over the years. Knowledge of her past increased rather than lessened
  his content with her stillness and silence; she was like a lovely cold vase,
  unadorned save by an escaping ray.</p>

  <p>He was also content, though less ecstatically, when Briac talked to him of
  Chopin, and played the familiar melodies with much brilliance. It appeared
  that the Frenchman knew several Chopin compositions that had never been
  published, and as he had written them down, Conway devoted pleasant hours to
  memorizing them himself. He found a certain piquancy in the reflection that
  neither Cortot nor Pachmann had been so fortunate. Nor were Briac's
  recollections at an end; his memory continually refreshed him with some
  little scrap of tune that the composer had thrown off or improvised on some
  occasion; he took them all down on paper as they came into his head, and some
  were very delightful fragments. "Briac," Chang explained, "has not long been
  initiated, so you must make allowances if he talks a great deal about Chopin.
  The younger lamas are naturally preoccupied with the past; it is a necessary
  step to envisaging the future."</p>

  <p>"Which is, I take it, the job of the older ones?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The High Lama, for instance, spends almost his entire life in
  clairvoyant meditation."</p>

  <p>Conway pondered a moment and then said: "By the way, when do you suppose I
  shall see him again?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless at the end of the first five years, my dear sir."</p>

  <p>But in that confident prophecy Chang was wrong, for less than a month
  after his arrival at Shangri-La Conway received a second summons to that
  torrid upper room. Chang had told him that the High Lama never left his
  apartments, and that their heated atmosphere was necessary for his bodily
  existence; and Conway, being thus prepared, found the change less
  disconcerting than before. Indeed, he breathed easily as soon as he had made
  his bow and been granted the faintest answering liveliness of the sunken
  eyes. He felt kinship with the mind beyond them, and though he knew that this
  second interview following so soon upon the first was an unprecedented honor,
  he was not in the least nervous or weighed down with solemnity. Age was to
  him no more an obsessing factor than rank or color; he had never felt
  debarred from liking people because they were too young or too old. He held
  the High Lama in most cordial respect, but he did not see why their social
  relations should be anything less than urbane.</p>

  <p>They exchanged the usual courtesies, and Conway answered many polite
  questions. He said he was finding the life very agreeable and had already
  made friendships.</p>

  <p>"And you have kept our secrets from your three companions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, up to now. It has proved awkward for me at times, but probably less
  so than if I had told them."</p>

  <p>"Just as I surmised; you have acted as you thought best. And the
  awkwardness, after all, is only temporary. Chang tells me he thinks that two
  of them will give little trouble."</p>

  <p>"I daresay that is so."</p>

  <p>"And the third?"</p>

  <p>Conway replied: "Mallinson is an excitable youth&mdash;he's pretty keen to
  get back."</p>

  <p>"You like him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I like him very much."</p>

  <p>At this point the tea bowls were brought in, and talk became less serious
  between sips of the scented liquid. It was an apt convention, enabling the
  verbal flow to acquire a touch of that almost frivolous fragrance, and Conway
  was responsive. When the High Lama asked him whether Shangri-La was not
  unique in his experience, and if the Western world could offer anything in
  the least like it, he answered with a smile: "Well, yes&mdash;to be quite
  frank, it reminds me very slightly of Oxford, where I used to lecture. The
  scenery there is not so good, but the subjects of study are often just as
  impractical, and though even the oldest of the dons is not quite so old, they
  appear to age in a somewhat similar way."</p>

  <p>"You have a sense of humor, my dear Conway," replied the High Lama, "for
  which we shall all be grateful during the years to come."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Extraordinary," Chang said, when he heard that Conway had
  seen the High Lama again. And from one so reluctant to employ superlatives,
  the word was significant. It had never happened before, he emphasized, since
  the routine of the lamasery became established; never had the High Lama
  desired a second meeting until the five years' probation had effected a purge
  of all the exile's likely emotions. "Because, you see, it is a great strain
  on him to talk to the average newcomer. The mere presence of human passions
  is an unwelcome and, at his age, an almost unendurable unpleasantness. Not
  that I doubt his entire wisdom in the matter. It teaches us, I believe, a
  lesson of great value&mdash;that even the fixed rules of our community are
  only moderately fixed. But it is extraordinary, all the same."</p>

  <p>To Conway, of course, it was no more extraordinary than anything else, and
  after he had visited the High Lama on a third and fourth occasion, he began
  to feel that it was not very extraordinary at all. There seemed, indeed,
  something almost preordained in the ease with which their two minds
  approached each other; it was as if in Conway all secret tensions were
  relaxed, giving him, when he came away, a sumptuous tranquillity. At times he
  had the sensation of being completely bewitched by the mastery of that
  central intelligence, and then, over the little pale blue tea bowls, the
  celebration would contract into a liveliness so gentle and miniature that he
  had an impression of a theorem dissolving limpidly into a sonnet.</p>

  <p>Their talks ranged far and fearlessly; entire philosophies were unfolded;
  the long avenues of history surrendered themselves for inspection and were
  given new plausibility. To Conway it was an entrancing experience, but he did
  not suspend the critical attitude, and once, when he had argued a point, the
  High Lama replied: "My son, you are young in years, but I perceive that your
  wisdom has the ripeness of age. Surely some unusual thing has happened to
  you?"</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "No more unusual than has happened to many others of my
  generation."</p>

  <p>"I have never met your like before."</p>

  <p>Conway answered after an interval: "There's not a great deal of mystery
  about it. That part of me which seems old to you was worn out by intense and
  premature experience. My years from nineteen to twenty-two were a supreme
  education, no doubt, but rather exhausting."</p>

  <p>"You were very unhappy at the war?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly so. I was excited and suicidal and scared and reckless
  and sometimes in a tearing rage&mdash;like a few million others, in fact. I
  got mad drunk and killed and lechered in great style. It was the self-abuse
  of all one's emotions, and one came through it, if one did at all, with a
  sense of almighty boredom and fretfulness. That's what made the years
  afterwards so difficult. Don't think I'm posing myself too
  tragically&mdash;I've had pretty fair luck since, on the whole. But it's been
  rather like being in a school where there's a bad headmaster&mdash;plenty of
  fun to be got if you feel like it, but nerve-racking off and on, and not
  really very satisfactory. I think I found that out rather more than most
  people."</p>

  <p>"And your education thus continued?"</p>

  <p>Conway gave a shrug. "Perhaps the exhaustion of the passions is the
  beginning of wisdom, if you care to alter the proverb."</p>

  <p>"That also, my son, is the doctrine of Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>"I know. It makes me feel quite at home."</p>

  <p>He had spoken no less than the truth. As the days and weeks passed he
  began to feel an ache of contentment uniting mind and body; like Perrault and
  Henschell and the others, he was falling under the spell. Blue Moon had taken
  him, and there was no escape. The mountains gleamed around in a hedge of
  inaccessible purity, from which his eyes fell dazzled to the green depths of
  the valley; the whole picture was incomparable, and when he heard the
  harpsichord's silver monotony across the lotus pool, he felt that it threaded
  the perfect pattern of sight and sound.</p>

  <p>He was, and he knew it, very quietly in love with the little Manchu. His
  love demanded nothing, not even reply; it was a tribute of the mind, to which
  his senses added only a flavor. She stood for him as a symbol of all that was
  delicate and fragile; her stylized courtesies and the touch of her fingers on
  the keyboard yielded a completely satisfying intimacy. Sometimes he would
  address her in a way that might, if she cared, have led to less formal
  conversation; but her replies never broke through the exquisite privacy of
  her thoughts, and in a sense he did not wish them to. He had suddenly come to
  realize a single facet of the promised jewel; he had Time, Time for
  everything that he wished to happen, such Time that desire itself was
  quenched in the certainty of fulfillment. A year, a decade hence, there would
  still be Time. The vision grew on him, and he was happy with it.</p>

  <p>Then, at intervals, he stepped into the other life to encounter
  Mallinson's impatience, Barnard's heartiness, and Miss Brinklow's robust
  intention. He felt he would be glad when they all knew as much as he; and,
  like Chang, he could imagine that neither the American nor the missionary
  would prove difficult cases. He was even amused when Barnard once said: "You
  know, Conway, I'm not sure that this wouldn't be a nice little place to
  settle down in. I thought at first I'd miss the newspapers and the movies,
  but I guess one can get used to anything."</p>

  <p>"I guess one can," agreed Conway.</p>

  <p>He learned afterwards that Chang had taken Barnard down to the valley, at
  his own request, to enjoy everything in the way of a "night out" that the
  resources of the locality could provide. Mallinson, when he heard of this,
  was rather scornful. "Getting tight, I suppose," he remarked to Conway, and
  to Barnard himself he commented: "Of course it's none of my business, but
  you'll want to keep yourself pretty fit for the journey, you know. The
  porters are due in a fortnight's time, and from what I gather, the return
  trip won't be exactly a joy ride."</p>

  <p>Barnard nodded equably. "I never figgered it would," he answered. "And as
  for keeping fit, I guess I'm fitter than I've been for years. I get exercise
  daily, I don't have any worries, and the speakeasies down in the valley don't
  let you go too far. Moderation, y'know&mdash;the motto of the firm."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've no doubt you've been managing to have a moderately good time,"
  said Mallinson acidly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I have. This establishment caters for all tastes&mdash;some
  people like little Chink gels who play the pi-anno, isn't that so? You can't
  blame anybody for what they fancy."</p>

  <p>Conway was not at all put out, but Mallinson flushed like a schoolboy.
  "You can send them to jail, though, when they fancy other people's property,"
  he snapped, stung to fury that set a raw edge to his wits.</p>

  <p>"Sure, if you can catch 'em." The American grinned affably. "And that
  leads me to something I may as well tell you folks right away, now we're on
  the subject. I've decided to give those porters a miss. They come here pretty
  regular, and I'll wait for the next trip, or maybe the next but one. That is,
  if the monks'll take my word that I'm still good for my hotel expenses."</p>

  <p>"You mean you're not coming with us?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. I've decided to stop over for a while. It's all very fine for
  you&mdash;you'll have the band playing when YOU get home, but all the welcome
  I'll get is from a row of cops. And the more I think about it, the more it
  don't seem good enough."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you're just afraid to face the music?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I never did like music, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Mallinson said with cold scorn: "I suppose it's your own affair. Nobody
  can prevent you from stopping here all your life if you feel inclined."
  Nevertheless he looked round with a flash of appeal. "It's not what everybody
  would choose to do, but ideas differ. What do you say, Conway?"</p>

  <p>"I agree. Ideas DO differ."</p>

  <p>Mallinson turned to Miss Brinklow, who suddenly put down her book and
  remarked: "As a matter of fact, I think I shall stay too."</p>

  <p>"WHAT?" they all cried together.</p>

  <p>She continued, with a bright smile that seemed more an attachment to her
  face than an illumination of it: "You see, I've been thinking over the way
  things happened to bring us all here, and there's only one conclusion I can
  come to. There's a mysterious power working behind the scenes. Don't you
  think so, Mr. Conway?"</p>

  <p>Conway might have found it hard to reply, but Miss Brinklow went on in a
  gathering hurry: "Who am I to question the dictates of Providence? I was sent
  here for a purpose, and I shall stay."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you're hoping to start a mission here?" Mallinson asked.</p>

  <p>"Not only hoping, but fully intending. I know just how to deal with these
  people&mdash;I shall get my own way, never fear. There's no real grit in any
  of them."</p>

  <p>"And you intend to introduce some?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do, Mr. Mallinson. I'm strongly opposed to that idea of moderation
  that we hear so much about. You can call it broad-mindedness if you like, but
  in my opinion it leads to the worst kind of laxity. The whole trouble with
  the people here is their so-called broad-mindedness, and I intend to fight it
  with all my powers."</p>

  <p>"And they're so broad-minded that they're going to let you?" said Conway,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Or else she's so strong-minded that they can't stop her," put in Barnard.
  He added with a chuckle: "It's just what I said&mdash;this establishment
  caters for all tastes."</p>

  <p>"Possibly, if you happen to LIKE prison," Mallinson snapped.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's two ways of looking even at that. My goodness, if you think
  of all the folks in the world who'd give all they've got to be out of the
  racket and in a place like this, only they can't get out! Are WE in the
  prison or are THEY?"</p>

  <p>"A comforting speculation for a monkey in a cage," retorted Mallinson; he
  was still furious.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he spoke to Conway alone. "That man still gets on my nerves,"
  he said, pacing the courtyard. "I'm not sorry we shan't have him with us when
  we go back. You may think me touchy, but being chipped about that Chinese
  girl didn't appeal to my sense of humor."</p>

  <p>Conway took Mallinson's arm. It was becoming increasingly clear to him
  that he was very fond of the youth, and that their recent weeks in company
  had deepened the feeling, despite jarring moods. He answered: "I rather took
  it that I was being ragged about her, not you."</p>

  <p>"No, I think he intended it for me. He knows I'm interested in her. I am,
  Conway. I can't make out why she's here, and whether she really likes being
  here. My God, if I spoke her language as you do, I'd soon have it out with
  her."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would. She doesn't say a great deal to anyone, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"It puzzles me that you don't badger her with all sorts of questions."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I care for badgering people."</p>

  <p>He wished he could have said more, and then suddenly the sense of pity and
  irony floated over him in a filmy haze; this youth, so eager and ardent,
  would take things very hardly. "I shouldn't worry about Lo-Tsen if I were
  you," he added. "She's happy enough."</p>

  <p>The decision of Barnard and Miss Brinklow to remain behind seemed to
  Conway all to the good, though it threw Mallinson and himself into an
  apparently opposite camp for the time being. It was an extraordinary
  situation, and he had no definite plans for tackling it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately there was no apparent need to tackle it at all. Until the two
  months were past, nothing much could happen; and afterwards there would be a
  crisis no less acute for his having tried to prepare himself for it. For this
  and other reasons he was disinclined to worry over the inevitable, though he
  did once say: "You know, Chang, I'm bothered about young Mallinson. I'm
  afraid he'll take things very badly when he finds out."</p>

  <p>Chang nodded with some sympathy. "Yes, it will not be easy to persuade him
  of his good fortune. But the difficulty is, after all, only a temporary one.
  In twenty years from now our friend will be quite reconciled."</p>

  <p>Conway felt that this was looking at the matter almost too
  philosophically. "I'm wondering," he said, "just how the truth's going to be
  broached to him. He's counting the days to the arrival of the porters, and if
  they don't come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But they WILL come."</p>

  <p>"Oh? I rather imagined that all your talk about them was just a pleasant
  fable to let us down lightly."</p>

  <p>"By no means. Although we have no bigotry on the point, it is our custom
  at Shangri-La to be moderately truthful, and I can assure you that my
  statements about the porters were almost correct. At any rate, we are
  expecting the men at or about the time I said."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll find it hard to stop Mallinson from joining them."</p>

  <p>"But we should never attempt to do so. He will merely discover&mdash;no
  doubt by personal experiment&mdash;that the porters are reluctantly unable to
  take anyone back with them."</p>

  <p>"I see. So that's the method? And what do you expect to happen
  afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear sir, after a period of disappointment, he will&mdash; since
  he is young and optimistic&mdash;begin to hope that the next convoy of
  porters, due in nine or ten months' time will prove more amenable to his
  suggestions. And this is a hope which, if we are wise, we shall not at first
  discourage."</p>

  <p>Conway said sharply: "I'm not so sure that he'll do that at all. I should
  think he's far more likely to try an escape on his own."</p>

  <p>"ESCAPE? Is that REALLY the word that should be used? After all, the pass
  is open to anyone at any time. We have no jailers, save those that Nature
  herself has provided."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "Well, you must admit that she's done her job pretty well.
  But I don't suppose you rely on her in every case, all the same. What about
  the various exploring parties that have arrived here? Was the pass always
  equally open to THEM when they wanted to get away?"</p>

  <p>It was Chang's turn now to smile. "Special circumstances, my dear sir,
  have sometimes required special consideration."</p>

  <p>"Excellent. So you only allow people the chance of escape when you know
  they'd be fools to take it? Even so, I expect some of them do."</p>

  <p>"Well, it has happened very occasionally, but as a rule the absentees are
  glad to return after the experience of a single night on the plateau."</p>

  <p>"Without shelter and proper clothing? If so, I can quite understand that
  your mild methods are as effective as stern ones. But what about the less
  usual cases that don't return?"</p>

  <p>"You have yourself answered the question," replied Chang. "They do not
  return." But he made haste to add: "I can assure you, however, that there are
  few indeed who have been so unfortunate, and I trust your friend will not be
  rash enough to increase the number."</p>

  <p>Conway did not find these responses entirely reassuring, and Mallinson's
  future remained a preoccupation. He wished it were possible for the youth to
  return by consent, and this would not be unprecedented, for there was the
  recent case of Talu, the airman. Chang admitted that the authorities were
  fully empowered to do anything that they considered wise. "But SHOULD we be
  wise, my dear sir, in trusting our future entirely to your friend's feeling
  of gratitude?"</p>

  <p>Conway felt that the question was pertinent, for Mallinson's attitude left
  little doubt as to what he would do as soon as he reached India. It was his
  favorite theme, and he had often enlarged upon it.</p>

  <p>But all that, of course, was in the mundane world that was gradually being
  pushed out of his mind by the rich, pervasive world of Shangri-La. Except
  when he thought about Mallinson, he was extraordinarily content; the slowly
  revealed fabric of this new environment continued to astonish him by its
  intricate suitability to his own needs and tastes.</p>

  <p>Once he said to Chang: "By the way, how do you people here fit love into
  your scheme of things? I suppose it does sometimes happen that those who come
  here develop attachments?"</p>

  <p>"Quite often," replied Chang with a broad smile. "The lamas, of course,
  are immune, and so are most of us when we reach the riper years, but until
  then we are as other men, except that I think we can claim to behave more
  reasonably. And this gives me the opportunity, Mr. Conway, of assuring you
  that the hospitality of Shangri-La is of a comprehensive kind. Your friend
  Mr. Barnard has already availed himself of it."</p>

  <p>Conway returned the smile. "Thanks," he answered dryly. "I've no doubt he
  has, but my own inclinations are not&mdash;at the moment&mdash;so assertive.
  It was the emotional more than the physical aspect that I was curious
  about."</p>

  <p>"You find it easy to separate the two? Is it possible that you are falling
  in love with Lo-Tsen?"</p>

  <p>Conway was somewhat taken aback, though he hoped he did not show it. "What
  makes you ask that?"</p>

  <p>"Because, my dear sir, it would be quite suitable if you were to do so
  &mdash;always, of course, in moderation. Lo-Tsen would not respond with any
  degree of passion&mdash;that is more than you could expect&mdash;but the
  experience would be very delightful, I assure you. And I speak with some
  authority, for I was in love with her myself when I was much younger."</p>

  <p>"Were you indeed? And did she respond then?"</p>

  <p>"Only by the most charming appreciation of the compliment I paid her, and
  by a friendship which has grown more precious with the years."</p>

  <p>"In other words, she didn't respond?"</p>

  <p>"If you prefer it so." Chang added, a little sententiously: "It has always
  been her way to spare her lovers the moment of satiety that goes with all
  absolute attainment."</p>

  <p>Conway laughed. "That's all very well in your case, and perhaps mine too
  &mdash;but what about the attitude of a hot-blooded young fellow like
  Mallinson?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, it would be the best possible thing that could happen! Not
  for the first time, I assure you, would Lo-Tsen comfort the sorrowful exile
  when he learns that there is to be no return."</p>

  <p>"COMFORT?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, though you must not misunderstand my use of the term. Lo-Tsen gives
  no caresses, except such as touch the stricken heart from her very presence.
  What does your Shakespeare say of Cleopatra?&mdash;'She makes hungry where
  she most satisfies.' A popular type, doubtless, among the passion-driven
  races, but such a woman, I assure you, would be altogether out of place at
  Shangri-La. Lo-Tsen, if I might amend the quotation, REMOVES hunger where she
  LEAST satisfies. It is a more delicate and lasting accomplishment."</p>

  <p>"And one, I assume, which she has much skill in performing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, decidedly&mdash;we have had many examples of it. It is her way to
  calm the throb of desire to a murmur that is no less pleasant when left
  unanswered."</p>

  <p>"In that sense, then, you could regard her as a part of the training
  equipment of the establishment?"</p>

  <p>"YOU could regard her as that, if you wished," replied Chang with
  deprecating blandness. "But it would be more graceful, and just as true, to
  liken her to the rainbow reflected in a glass bowl or to the dewdrops on the
  blossoms of the fruit tree."</p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with you, Chang. That would be MUCH more graceful."
  Conway enjoyed the measured yet agile repartees which his good-humored
  ragging of the Chinese very often elicited.</p>

  <p>But the next time he was alone with the little Manchu he felt that Chang's
  remarks had had a great deal of shrewdness in them. There was a fragrance
  about her that communicated itself to his own emotions, kindling the embers
  to a glow that did not burn, but merely warmed. And suddenly then he realized
  that Shangri-La and Lo-Tsen were quite perfect, and that he did not wish for
  more than to stir a faint and eventual response in all that stillness. For
  years his passions had been like a nerve that the world jarred on; now at
  last the aching was soothed, and he could yield himself to love that was
  neither a torment nor a bore. As he passed by the lotus pool at night he
  sometimes pictured her in his arms, but the sense of time washed over the
  vision, calming him to an infinite and tender reluctance.</p>

  <p>He did not think he had ever been so happy, even in the years of his life
  before the great barrier of the war. He liked the serene world that
  Shangri-La offered him, pacified rather than dominated by its single
  tremendous idea. He liked the prevalent mood in which feelings were sheathed
  in thoughts, and thoughts softened into felicity by their transference into
  language. Conway, whom experience had taught that rudeness is by no means a
  guarantee of good faith, was even less inclined to regard a well-turned
  phrase as a proof of insincerity. He liked the mannered, leisurely atmosphere
  in which talk was an accomplishment, not a mere habit. And he liked to
  realize that the idlest things could now be freed from the curse of
  time-wasting, and the frailest dreams receive the welcome of the mind.
  Shangri-La was always tranquil, yet always a hive of unpursuing occupations;
  the lamas lived as if indeed they had time on their hands, but time that was
  scarcely a featherweight. Conway met no more of them, but he came gradually
  to realize the extent and variety of their employments; besides their
  knowledge of languages, some, it appeared, took to the full seas of learning
  in a manner that would have yielded big surprises to the Western world. Many
  were engaged in writing manuscript books of various kinds; one (Chang said)
  had made valuable researches into pure mathematics; another was coordinating
  Gibbon and Spengler into a vast thesis on the history of European
  civilization. But this kind of thing was not for them all, nor for any of
  them always; there were many tideless channels in which they dived in mere
  waywardness, retrieving, like Briac, fragments of old tunes, or like the
  English ex-curate, a new theory about Wuthering Heights. And there were even
  fainter impracticalities than these. Once, when Conway made some remark in
  this connection, the High Lama replied with a story of a Chinese artist in
  the third century B.C. who, having spent many years in carving dragons,
  birds, and horses upon a cherrystone, offered his finished work to a royal
  prince. The prince could see nothing in it at first except a mere stone, but
  the artist bade him "have a wall built, and make a window in it, and observe
  the stone through the window in the glory of the dawn." The prince did so,
  and then perceived that the stone was indeed very beautiful. "Is not that a
  charming story, my dear Conway, and do you not think it teaches a very
  valuable lesson?"</p>

  <p>Conway agreed; he found it pleasant to realize that the serene purpose of
  Shangri-La could embrace an infinitude of odd and apparently trivial
  employments, for he had always had a taste for such things himself. In fact,
  when he regarded his past, he saw it strewn with images of tasks too vagrant
  or too taxing ever to have been accomplished; but now they were all possible,
  even in a mood of idleness. It was delightful to contemplate, and he was not
  disposed to sneer when Barnard confided in him that he too envisaged an
  interesting future at Shangri-La.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Barnard's excursions to the valley, which had been growing
  more frequent of late, were not entirely devoted to drink and women. "You
  see, Conway, I'm telling you this because you're different from Mallinson
  &mdash;he's got his knife into me, as probably you've gathered. But I feel
  you'll be better at understanding the position. It's a funny thing&mdash; you
  British officials are so darned stiff and starchy at first, but you're the
  sort a fellow can put his trust in, when all's said and done."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be too sure," replied Conway, smiling. "And anyhow,
  Mallinson's just as much a British official as I am."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he's a mere boy. He don't look at things reasonably. You and me
  are men of the world&mdash;we take things as we find them. This joint here,
  for instance&mdash;we still can't understand all the ins and outs of it, and
  why we've been landed here, but then, isn't that the usual way of things? Do
  we know why we're in the world at all, for that matter?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps some of us don't, but what's all this leading up to?"</p>

  <p>Barnard dropped his voice to a rather husky whisper. "Gold, my lad," he
  answered with a certain ecstasy. "Just that, and nothing less. There's tons
  of it&mdash;literally&mdash;in the valley. I was a mining engineer in my
  young days and I haven't forgotten what a reef looks like. Believe me, it's
  as rich as the Rand, and ten times easier to get at. I guess you thought I
  was on the loose whenever I went down there in my little armchair. Not a bit
  of it. I knew what I was doing. I'd figgered it out all along, you know, that
  these guys here couldn't get all their stuff sent in from outside without
  paying mighty high for it, and what else could they pay with except gold or
  silver or diamonds or something? Only logic, after all. And when I began to
  scout round, it didn't take me long to discover the whole bag of tricks."</p>

  <p>"You found it out on your own?" asked Conway.</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't say that, but I made my guess, and then I put the matter to
  Chang&mdash;straight, mind you, as man to man. And believe me, Conway, that
  Chink's not as bad a fellow as we might have thought."</p>

  <p>"Personally, I never thought him a bad fellow at all."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I know you always took to him, so you won't be surprised at
  the way we got on together. We certainly did hit it famously. He showed me
  all over the workings, and it may interest you to know that I've got the full
  permission of the authorities to prospect in the valley as much as I like and
  make a comprehensive report. What d'you think of that, my lad? They seemed
  quite glad to have the services of an expert, especially when I said I could
  probably give 'em tips on how to increase output."</p>

  <p>"I can see you're going to be altogether at home here," said Conway.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say I've found a job, and that's something. And you never
  know how a thing'll turn out in the end. Maybe the folks at home won't be so
  keen to jail me when they know I can show 'em the way to a new gold mine. The
  only difficulty is&mdash;would they take my word about it?"</p>

  <p>"They might. It's extraordinary what people WILL believe."</p>

  <p>Barnard nodded with enthusiasm. "Glad you get the point, Conway. And
  that's where you and I can make a deal. We'll go fifty-fifty in everything of
  course. All you've gotter do is to put your name to my report&mdash;British
  Consul, you know, and all that. It'll carry weight."</p>

  <p>Conway laughed. "We'll have to see about it. Make your report first."</p>

  <p>It amused him to contemplate a possibility so unlikely to happen, and at
  the same time he was glad that Barnard had found something that yielded such
  immediate comfort.</p>

  <p>So also was the High Lama, whom Conway began to see more and more
  frequently. He often visited him in the late evening and stayed for many
  hours, long after the servants had taken away the last bowls of tea and had
  been dismissed for the night. The High Lama never failed to ask him about the
  progress and welfare of his three companions, and once he enquired
  particularly as to the kind of careers that their arrival at Shangri-La had
  so inevitably interrupted.</p>

  <p>Conway answered reflectively: "Mallinson might have done quite well in his
  own line&mdash;he's energetic and has ambitions. The two others&mdash;" He
  shrugged his shoulders. "As a matter of fact, it happens to suit them both to
  stay here&mdash;for a while, at any rate."</p>

  <p>He noticed a flicker of light at the curtained window; there had been
  mutterings of thunder as he crossed the courtyard on his way to the now
  familiar room. No sound could be heard, and the heavy tapestries subdued the
  lightning into mere sparks of pallor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," came the reply, "we have done our best to make both of them feel at
  home. Miss Brinklow wishes to convert us, and Mr. Barnard would also like to
  convert us&mdash;into a limited liability company. Harmless projects
  &mdash;they will pass the time quite pleasantly for them. But your young
  friend, to whom neither gold nor religion can offer solace, how about
  HIM?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's going to be the problem."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he is going to be YOUR problem."</p>

  <p>"Why mine?"</p>

  <p>There was no immediate answer, for the tea bowls were introduced at that
  moment, and with their appearance the High Lama rallied a faint and desicated
  hospitality. "Karakal sends us storms at this time of the year," he remarked,
  feathering the conversation according to ritual. "The people of Blue Moon
  believe they are caused by demons raging in the great space beyond the pass.
  The 'outside,' they call it&mdash;perhaps you are aware that in their patois
  the word is used for the entire rest of the world. Of course they know
  nothing of such countries as France or England or even India&mdash;they
  imagine the dread altiplano stretching, as it almost does, illimitably. To
  them, so snug at their warm and windless levels, it appears unthinkable that
  anyone inside the valley should ever wish to leave it; indeed, they picture
  all unfortunate 'outsiders' as passionately desiring to enter. It is just a
  question of viewpoint, is it not?"</p>

  <p>Conway was reminded of Barnard's somewhat similar remarks, and quoted
  them. "How very sensible!" was the High Lama's comment. "And he is our first
  American, too&mdash;we are truly fortunate."</p>

  <p>Conway found it piquant to reflect that the lamasery's fortune was to have
  acquired a man for whom the police of a dozen countries were actively
  searching; and he would have liked to share the piquancy but for feeling that
  Barnard had better be left to tell his own story in due course. He said:
  "Doubtless he's quite right, and there are many people in the world nowadays
  who would be glad enough to be here."</p>

  <p>"TOO many, my dear Conway. We are a single lifeboat riding the seas in a
  gale; we can take a few chance survivors, but if all the shipwrecked were to
  reach us and clamber aboard we should go down ourselves... But let us not
  think of it just now. I hear that you have been associating with our
  excellent Briac. A delightful fellow countryman of mine, though I do not
  share his opinion that Chopin is the greatest of all composers. For myself,
  as you know, I prefer Mozart..."</p>

  <p>Not till the tea bowls were removed and the servant had been finally
  dismissed did Conway venture to recall the unanswered question. "We were
  discussing Mallinson, and you said he was going to be MY problem. Why mine,
  particularly?"</p>

  <p>Then the High Lama replied very simply: "Because, my son, I am going to
  die."</p>

  <p>It seemed an extraordinary statement, and for a time Conway was speechless
  after it. Eventually the High Lama continued: "You are surprised? But surely,
  my friend, we are all mortal&mdash;even at Shangri-La. And it is possible
  that I may still have a few moments left to me&mdash;or even, for that
  matter, a few years. All I announce is the simple truth that already I see
  the end. It is charming of you to appear so concerned, and I will not pretend
  that there is not a touch of wistfulness, even at my age, in contemplating
  death. Fortunately little is left of me that can die physically, and as for
  the rest, all our religions display a pleasant unanimity of optimism. I am
  quite content, but I must accustom myself to a strange sensation during the
  hours that remain&mdash;I must realize that I have time for only one thing
  more. Can you imagine what that is?"</p>

  <p>Conway was silent.</p>

  <p>"It concerns you, my son."</p>

  <p>"You do me a great honor."</p>

  <p>"I have in mind to do much more than that."</p>

  <p>Conway bowed slightly, but did not speak, and the High Lama, after waiting
  awhile, resumed: "You know, perhaps, that the frequency of these talks has
  been unusual here. But it is our tradition, if I may permit myself the
  paradox, that we are never slaves to tradition. We have no rigidities, no
  inexorable rules. We do as we think fit, guided a little by the example of
  the past, but still more by our present wisdom, and by our clairvoyance of
  the future. And thus it is that I am encouraged to do this final thing."</p>

  <p>Conway was still silent.</p>

  <p>"I place in your hands, my son, the heritage and destiny of
  Shangri-La."</p>

  <p>At last the tension broke, and Conway felt beyond it the power of a bland
  and benign persuasion; the echoes swam into silence, till all that was left
  was his own heartbeat, pounding like a gong. And then, intercepting the
  rhythm, came the words:</p>

  <p>"I have waited for you, my son, for quite a long time. I have sat in this
  room and seen the faces of newcomers, I have looked into their eyes and heard
  their voices, and always in hope that someday I might find you. My colleagues
  have grown old and wise, but you who are still young in years are as wise
  already. My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order
  knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of
  the mind, to preside in wisdom and secrecy while the storm rages without
  &mdash;it will all be very pleasantly simple for you, and you will doubtless
  find great happiness."</p>

  <p>Again Conway sought to reply, but could not, till at length a vivid
  lightning flash paled the shadows and stirred him to exclaim: "The storm...
  this storm you talked of..."</p>

  <p>"It will be such a one, my son, as the world has not seen before. There
  will be no safety by arms, no help from authority, no answer in science. It
  will rage till every flower of culture is trampled, and all human things are
  leveled in a vast chaos. Such was my vision when Napoleon was still a name
  unknown; and I see it now, more clearly with each hour. Do you say I am
  mistaken?"</p>

  <p>Conway answered: "No, I think you may be right. A similar crash came once
  before, and then there were the Dark Ages lasting five hundred years."</p>

  <p>"The parallel is not quite exact. For those Dark Ages were not really so
  very dark&mdash;they were full of flickering lanterns, and even if the light
  had gone out of Europe altogether, there were other rays, literally from
  China to Peru, at which it could have been rekindled. But the Dark Ages that
  are to come will cover the whole world in a single pall; there will be
  neither escape nor sanctuary, save such as are too secret to be found or too
  humble to be noticed. And Shangri-La may hope to be both of these. The airman
  bearing loads of death to the great cities will not pass our way, and if by
  chance he should, he may not consider us worth a bomb."</p>

  <p>"And you think all this will come in my time?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that you will live through the storm. And after, through the
  long age of desolation, you may still live, growing older and wiser and more
  patient. You will conserve the fragrance of our history and add to it the
  touch of your own mind. You will welcome the stranger, and teach him the rule
  of age and wisdom; and one of these strangers, it may be, will succeed you
  when you are yourself very old. Beyond that, my vision weakens, but I see, at
  a great distance, a new world stirring in the ruins, stirring clumsily but in
  hopefulness, seeking its lost and legendary treasures. And they will all be
  here, my son, hidden behind the mountains in the valley of Blue Moon,
  preserved as by miracle for a new Renaissance..."</p>

  <p>The speaking finished, and Conway saw the face before him full of a remote
  and drenching beauty; then the glow faded and there was nothing left but a
  mask, dark-shadowed, and crumbling like old wood. It was quite motionless,
  and the eyes were closed. He watched for a while, and presently, as part of a
  dream, it came to him that the High Lama was dead.</p>

  <p>It seemed necessary to rivet the situation to some kind of actuality, lest
  it become too strange to be believed in; and with instinctive mechanism of
  hand and eye, Conway glanced at his wristwatch. It was a quarter-past
  midnight. Suddenly, when he crossed the room to the door, it occurred to him
  that he did not in the least know how or whence to summon help. The Tibetans,
  he knew, had all been sent away for the night, and he had no idea where to
  find Chang or anyone else. He stood uncertainly on the threshold of the dark
  corridor; through a window he could see that the sky was clear, though the
  mountains still blazed in lightning like a silver fresco. And then, in the
  midst of the still-encompassing dream, he felt himself master of Shangri-La.
  These were his beloved things, all around him, the things of that inner mind
  in which he lived increasingly, away from the fret of the world. His eyes
  strayed into the shadows and were caught by golden pinpoints sparkling in
  rich, undulating lacquers; and the scent of tuberose, so faint that it
  expired on the very brink of sensation, lured him from room to room. At last
  he stumbled into the courtyards and by the fringe of the pool; a full moon
  sailed behind Karakal. It was twenty minutes to two.</p>

  <p>Later, he was aware that Mallinson was near him, holding his arm and
  leading him away in a great hurry. He did not gather what it was all about,
  but he could hear that the boy was chattering excitedly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They reached the balconied room where they had meals,
  Mallinson still clutching his arm and half-dragging him along. "Come on,
  Conway, we've till dawn to pack what we can and get away. Great news,
  man&mdash;I wonder what old Barnard and Miss Brinklow will think in the
  morning when they find us gone... Still, it's their own choice to stay, and
  we'll probably get on far better without them... The porters are about five
  miles beyond the pass &mdash;they came yesterday with loads of books and
  things... tomorrow they begin the journey back... It just shows how these
  fellows here intended to let us down&mdash;they never told us&mdash;we should
  have been stranded here for God knows how much longer... I say, what's the
  matter? Are you ill?"</p>

  <p>Conway had sunk into a chair, and was leaning forward with elbows on the
  table. He passed his hand across his eyes. "Ill? No. I don't think so. Just
  &mdash;rather&mdash;tired."</p>

  <p>"Probably the storm. Where were you all the while? I'd been waiting for
  you for hours."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I was visiting the High Lama."</p>

  <p>"Oh, HIM! Well, THAT'S for the last time, anyhow, thank God."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mallinson, for the last time."</p>

  <p>Something in Conway's voice, and still more in his succeeding silence,
  roused the youth to irascibility. "Well, I wish you wouldn't sound so deuced
  leisurely about it&mdash;we've got to get a considerable move on, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Conway stiffened for the effort of emerging into keener consciousness.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said. Partly to test his nerve and the reality of his
  sensations he lit a cigarette. He found that both hands and lips were
  unsteady. "I'm afraid I don't quite follow... you say the porters..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the porters, man&mdash;do pull yourself together."</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of going out to them?"</p>

  <p>"THINKING of it? I'm damn well certain&mdash;they're only just over the
  ridge. And we've got to start immediately."</p>

  <p>"IMMEDIATELY?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;why not?"</p>

  <p>Conway made a second attempt to transfer himself from one world into the
  other. He said at length, having partly succeeded: "I suppose you realize
  that it mayn't be quite as simple as it sounds?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson was lacing a pair of knee-high Tibetan mountain boots as he
  answered jerkily: "I realize everything, but it's something we've got to do,
  and we shall do it, with luck, if we don't delay."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord, Conway, must you fight shy of everything? Haven't you any guts
  left in you at all?"</p>

  <p>The appeal, half-passionate and half-derisive, helped Conway to collect
  himself. "Whether I have or haven't isn't the point, but if you want me to
  explain myself, I will. It's a question of a few rather important details.
  Suppose you DO get beyond the pass and find the porters there, how do you
  know they'll take you with them? What inducement can you offer? Hasn't it
  struck you that they mayn't be quite so willing as you'd like them to be? You
  can't just present yourself and demand to be escorted. It all needs
  arrangements, negotiations beforehand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or anything else to cause a delay," exclaimed Mallinson bitterly. "God,
  what a fellow you are! Fortunately I haven't you to rely on for arranging
  things. Because they HAVE been arranged&mdash;the porters have been paid in
  advance, and they've agreed to take us. And here are clothes and equipment
  for the journey, all ready. So your last excuse disappears. Come on, let's DO
  something."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I don't understand..."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you do, but it doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"Who's been making all these plans?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson answered brusquely: "Lo-Tsen, if you're really keen to know.
  She's with the porters now. She's waiting."</p>

  <p>"WAITING?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She's coming with us. I assume you've no objection?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of Lo-Tsen the two worlds touched and fused suddenly in
  Conway's mind. He cried sharply, almost contemptuously: "That's nonsense.
  It's impossible."</p>

  <p>Mallinson was equally on edge. "Why is it impossible?"</p>

  <p>"Because... well, it is. There are all sorts of reasons. Take my word for
  it; it won't do. It's incredible enough that she should be out there now
  &mdash;I'm astonished at what you say has happened&mdash;but the idea of her
  going any further is just preposterous."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it's preposterous at all. It's as natural for her to
  want to leave here as for me."</p>

  <p>"But she doesn't want to leave. That's where you make the mistake."</p>

  <p>Mallinson smiled tensely. "You think you know a good deal more about her
  than I do, I daresay," he remarked. "But perhaps you don't, for all
  that."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"There are other ways of getting to understand people without learning
  heaps of languages."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, what ARE you driving at?" Then Conway added more
  quietly: "This is absurd. We mustn't wrangle. Tell me, Mallinson, what's it
  all about? I still don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you making such an almighty fuss?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth, PLEASE tell me the truth."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's simple enough. A kid of her age shut up here with a lot of
  queer old men&mdash;naturally she'll get away if she's given a chance. She
  hasn't had one up to now."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you may be imagining her position in the light of your
  own? As I've always told you, she's perfectly happy."</p>

  <p>"Then why did she say she'd come?"</p>

  <p>"She said that? How could she? She doesn't speak English."</p>

  <p>"I asked her&mdash;in Tibetan&mdash;Miss Brinklow worked out the words. It
  wasn't a very fluent conversation, but it was quite enough to &mdash;to lead
  to an understanding." Mallinson flushed a little. "Damn it, Conway, don't
  stare at me like that&mdash;anyone would think I'd been poaching on YOUR
  preserves."</p>

  <p>Conway answered: "No one would think so at all, I hope, but the remark
  tells me more than you were perhaps intending me to know. I can only say that
  I'm very sorry."</p>

  <p>"And why the devil should you be?"</p>

  <p>Conway let the cigarette fall from his fingers. He felt tired, bothered,
  and full of deep conflicting tenderness that he would rather not have had
  aroused. He said gently: "I wish we weren't always at such cross-purposes.
  Lo-Tsen is very charming, I know, but why should we quarrel about it?"</p>

  <p>"CHARMING?" Mallinson echoed the word with scorn. "She's a good bit more
  than that. You mustn't think everybody's as cold-blooded about these things
  as you are yourself. Admiring her as if she were an exhibit in a museum may
  be your idea of what she deserves, but mine's more practical, and when I see
  someone I like in a rotten position I try and DO something."</p>

  <p>"But surely there's such a thing as being too impetuous? Where do you
  think she'll go to if she does leave?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose she must have friends in China or somewhere. Anyhow, she'll be
  better off than here."</p>

  <p>"How can you possibly be so sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll see that she's looked after myself, if nobody else will. After
  all, if you're rescuing people from something quite hellish, you don't
  usually stop to enquire if they've anywhere else to go to."</p>

  <p>"And you think Shangri-La is hellish?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely, I do. There's something dark and evil about it. The whole
  business has been like that, from the beginning&mdash;the way we were brought
  here, without reason at all, by some madman&mdash;and the way we've been
  detained since, on one excuse or another. But the most frightful thing of
  all&mdash;to me&mdash;is the effect it's had on you."</p>

  <p>"On ME?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, on you. You've just mooned about as if nothing mattered and you were
  content to stay here forever. Why, you even admitted you liked the place...
  Conway, what HAS happened to you? Can't you manage to be your real self
  again? We got on so well together at Baskul&mdash;you were absolutely
  different in those days."</p>

  <p>"My DEAR boy!"</p>

  <p>Conway reached his hand towards Mallinson's, and the answering grip was
  hot and eagerly affectionate. Mallinson went on: "I don't suppose you realize
  it, but I've been terribly alone these last few weeks. Nobody seemed to be
  caring a damn about the only thing that was really important&mdash;Barnard
  and Miss Brinklow had reasons of a kind, but it was pretty awful when I found
  YOU against me."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"You keep on saying that, but it doesn't help."</p>

  <p>Conway replied on sudden impulse: "Then let me help, if I can, by telling
  you something. When you've heard it, you'll understand, I hope, a great deal
  of what now seems very curious and difficult. At any rate, you'll realize why
  Lo-Tsen can't possibly go back with you."</p>

  <p>"I don't think anything would make me see that. And do cut it as short as
  you can, because we really haven't time to spare."</p>

  <p>Conway then gave, as briefly as he could, the whole story of Shangri-La,
  as told him by the High Lama, and as amplified by the conversation both with
  the latter and with Chang. It was the last thing he had ever intended to do,
  but he felt that in the circumstances it was justified and even necessary; it
  was true enough that Mallinson WAS his problem, to solve as he thought fit.
  He narrated rapidly and easily, and in doing so came again under the spell of
  that strange, timeless world; its beauty overwhelmed him as he spoke of it,
  and more than once he felt himself reading from a page of memory, so clearly
  had ideas and phrases impressed themselves. Only one thing he withheld
  &mdash;and that to spare himself an emotion he could not yet grapple with
  &mdash;the fact of the High Lama's death that night and of his own
  succession.</p>

  <p>When he approached the end he felt comforted; he was glad to have got it
  over, and it was the only solution, after all. He looked up calmly when he
  had finished, confident that he had done well.</p>

  <p>But Mallinson merely tapped his fingers on the tabletop and said, after a
  long wait: "I really don't know what to say, Conway... except that you must
  be completely mad..."</p>

  <p>There followed a long silence, during which the two men stared at each
  other in far different moods&mdash;Conway withdrawn and disappointed,
  Mallinson in hot, fidgeting discomfort. "So you think I'm mad?" said Conway
  at length.</p>

  <p>Mallinson broke into a nervous laugh. "Well, I should damn well say so,
  after a tale like that. I mean... well, really... such utter nonsense... it
  seems to me rather beyond arguing about."</p>

  <p>Conway looked and sounded immensely astonished. "You think it's
  nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"Well... how else can I look at it? I'm sorry, Conway&mdash;it's a pretty
  strong statement&mdash;but I don't see how any sane person could be in any
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>"So you still hold that we were brought here by blind accident&mdash;by
  some lunatic who made careful plans to run off with an aeroplane and fly it a
  thousand miles just for the fun of the thing?"</p>

  <p>Conway offered a cigarette, and the other took it. The pause was one for
  which they both seemed grateful. Mallinson answered eventually: "Look here,
  it's no good arguing the thing point by point. As a matter of fact, your
  theory that the people here sent someone vaguely into the world to decoy
  strangers, and that this fellow deliberately learned flying and bided his
  time until it happened that a suitable machine was due to leave Baskul with
  four passengers... well, I won't say that it's literally impossible, though
  it does seem to me ridiculously farfetched. If it stood by itself, it might
  just be worth considering, but when you tack it on to all sorts of other
  things that are ABSOLUTELY impossible&mdash;all this about the lamas being
  hundreds of years old, and having discovered a sort of elixir of youth, or
  whatever you'd call it... well, it just makes me wonder what kind of microbe
  has bitten you, that's all."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "Yes, I daresay you find it hard to believe. Perhaps I did
  myself at first&mdash;I scarcely remember. Of course it IS an extraordinary
  story, but I should think your own eyes have had enough evidence that this is
  an extraordinary place. Think of all that we've actually seen, both of us
  &mdash;a lost valley in the midst of unexplored mountains, a monastery with a
  library of European books&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, and a central heating plant, and modern plumbing, and afternoon
  tea, and everything else&mdash;it's all very marvelous, I know."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Damn little, I admit. It's a complete mystery. But that's no reason for
  accepting tales that are physically impossible. Believing in hot baths
  because you've had them is different from believing in people hundreds of
  years old just because they've told you they are." He laughed again, still
  uneasily. "Look here, Conway, it's got on your nerves, this place, and I
  really don't wonder at it. Pack up your things and let's quit. We'll finish
  this argument a month or two hence after a jolly little dinner at
  Maiden's."</p>

  <p>Conway answered quietly: "I've no desire to go back to that life at
  all."</p>

  <p>"What life?"</p>

  <p>"The life you're thinking of... dinners... dances... polo... and all
  that..."</p>

  <p>"But I never said anything about dances and polo! Anyhow, what's wrong
  with them? D'you mean that you're not coming with me? You're going to stay
  here like the other two? Then at least you shan't stop me from clearing out
  of it!" Mallinson threw down his cigarette and sprang towards the door with
  eyes blazing. "You're off your head!" he cried wildly. "You're mad, Conway,
  that's what's the matter with you! I know you're always calm, and I'm always
  excited, but I'm sane, at any rate, and you're not! They warned me about it
  before I joined you at Baskul, and I thought they were wrong, but now I can
  see they weren't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What did they warn you of?"</p>

  <p>"They said you'd been blown up in the war, and you'd been queer at times
  ever since. I'm not reproaching you&mdash;I know it was nothing you could
  help&mdash;and heaven knows I hate talking like this... Oh, I'll go. It's all
  frightful and sickening, but I must go. I gave my word."</p>

  <p>"To Lo-Tsen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you want to know."</p>

  <p>Conway got up and held out his hand. "Good-by, Mallinson."</p>

  <p>"For the last time, you're not coming?"</p>

  <p>"I can't."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, then."</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and Mallinson left.</p>

  <p>Conway sat alone in the lantern light. It seemed to him, in a phrase
  engraved on memory, that all the loveliest things were transient and
  perishable, that the two worlds were finally beyond reconciliation, and that
  one of them hung, as always, by a thread. After he had pondered for some time
  he looked at his watch; it was ten minutes to three.</p>

  <p>He was still at the table, smoking the last of his cigarettes, when
  Mallinson returned. The youth entered with some commotion, and on seeing him,
  stood back in the shadows as if to gather his wits. He was silent, and Conway
  began, after waiting a moment: "Hullo, what's happened? Why are you
  back?"</p>

  <p>The complete naturalness of the question fetched Mallinson forward; he
  pulled off his heavy sheepskins and sat down. His face was ashen and his
  whole body trembled. "I hadn't the nerve," he cried, half-sobbing. "That
  place where we were all roped&mdash;you remember? I got as far as that... I
  couldn't manage it. I've no head for heights, and in moonlight it looked
  fearful. Silly, isn't it?" He broke down completely and was hysterical until
  Conway pacified him. Then he added: "They needn't worry, these fellows here
  &mdash;nobody will ever threaten them by land. But, my God, I'd give a good
  deal to fly over with a load of bombs!"</p>

  <p>"Why would you like to do that, Mallinson?"</p>

  <p>"Because the place wants smashing up, whatever it is. It's unhealthy and
  unclean&mdash;and for that matter, if your impossible yarn were true, it
  would be more hateful still! A lot of wizened old men crouching here like
  spiders for anyone who comes near... it's filthy... who'd want to live to an
  age like that, anyhow? And as for your precious High Lama, if he's half as
  old as you say he is, it's time someone put him out of his misery... Oh, why
  WON'T you come away with me, Conway? I hate imploring you for my own sake,
  but damn it all, I'm young and we've been pretty good friends together
  &mdash;does my whole life mean nothing to you compared with the lies of these
  awful creatures? And Lo-Tsen, too&mdash;SHE'S young&mdash;doesn't SHE count
  at all?"</p>

  <p>"Lo-Tsen is not young," said Conway.</p>

  <p>Mallinson looked up and began to titter hysterically. "Oh, no, not young
  &mdash;not young at all, of course. She looks about seventeen, but I suppose
  you'll tell me she's really a well-preserved ninety."</p>

  <p>"Mallinson, she came here in 1884."</p>

  <p>"You're raving, man!"</p>

  <p>"Her beauty, Mallinson, like all other beauty in the world, lies at the
  mercy of those who do not know how to value it. It is a fragile thing that
  can only live where fragile things are loved. Take it away from this valley
  and you will see it fade like an echo."</p>

  <p>Mallinson laughed harshly, as if his own thoughts gave him confidence.
  "I'm not afraid of that. It's here that she's only an echo, if she's one
  anywhere at all." He added after a pause: "Not that this sort of talk gets us
  anywhere. We'd better cut out all the poetic stuff and come down to
  realities. Conway, I want to help you&mdash;it's all the sheerest nonsense, I
  know, but I'll argue it out if it'll do you any good. I'll pretend it's
  something possible that you've told me, and that it really does need
  examining. Now tell me, seriously, what evidence have you for this story of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>Conway was silent.</p>

  <p>"Merely that someone spun you a fantastic rigmarole. Even from a
  thoroughly reliable person whom you'd known all your life, you wouldn't
  accept that sort of thing without proof. And what proofs have you in this
  case? None at all, so far as I can see. Has Lo-Tsen ever told you her
  history?"</p>

  <p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then why believe it from someone else? And all this longevity business
  &mdash;can you point to a single outside fact in support of it?"</p>

  <p>Conway thought a moment and then mentioned the unknown Chopin works that
  Briac had played.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a matter that means nothing to me&mdash;I'm not a musician.
  But even if they're genuine, isn't it possible that he could have got hold of
  them in some way without his story being true?"</p>

  <p>"Quite possible, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"And then this method that you say exists&mdash;of preserving youth and so
  on. What is it? You say it's a sort of drug&mdash;well, I want to know WHAT
  drug? Have you ever seen it or tried it? Did anyone ever give you any
  positive facts about the thing at all?"</p>

  <p>"Not in detail, I admit."</p>

  <p>"And you never asked for details? It didn't strike you that such a story
  needed any confirmation at all? You just swallowed it whole?" Pressing his
  advantage, he continued: "How much do you actually know of this place, apart
  from what you've been told? You've seen a few old men&mdash;that's all it
  amounts to. Apart from that, we can only say that the place is well fitted
  up, and seems to be run on rather highbrow lines. How and why it came into
  existence we've no idea, and why they want to keep us here, if they do, is
  equally a mystery, but surely all that's hardly an excuse for believing any
  old legend that comes along! After all, man, you're a critical sort of person
  &mdash;you'd hesitate to believe all you were told even in an English
  monastery&mdash;I really can't see why you should jump at everything just
  because you're in Tibet!"</p>

  <p>Conway nodded. Even in the midst of far keener perceptions he could not
  restrain approval of a point well made. "That's an acute remark, Mallinson. I
  suppose the truth is that when it comes to believing things without actual
  evidence, we all incline to what we find most attractive."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm dashed if I can see anything attractive about living till
  you're half-dead. Give me a short life and a gay one, for choice. And this
  stuff about a future war&mdash;it all sounds pretty thin to me. How does
  anyone know when the next war's going to be or what it'll be like? Weren't
  all the prophets wrong about the last war?" He added, when Conway did not
  reply: "Anyhow, I don't believe in saying things are inevitable. And even if
  they were, there's no need to get into a funk about them. Heaven knows I'd
  most likely be scared stiff if I had to fight in a war, but I'd rather face
  up to it than bury myself here."</p>

  <p>Conway smiled. "Mallinson, you have a superb knack of misunderstanding me.
  When we were at Baskul you thought I was a hero&mdash;now you take me for a
  coward. In point of fact, I'm neither&mdash;though of course it doesn't
  matter. When you get back to India you can tell people, if you like, that I
  decided to stay in a Tibetan monastery because I was afraid there'd be
  another war. It isn't my reason at all, but I've no doubt it'll be believed
  by the people who already think me mad."</p>

  <p>Mallinson answered rather sadly: "It's silly, you know, to talk like that.
  Whatever happens, I'd never say a word against you. You can count on that. I
  don't understand you&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I wish I
  did. Oh, I wish I did. Conway, can't I possibly help you? Isn't there
  anything I can say or do?"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence after that, which Conway broke at last by saying:
  "There's just a question I'd like to ask&mdash;if you'll forgive me for being
  terribly personal."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Are you in love with Lo-Tsen?"</p>

  <p>The youth's pallor changed quickly to a flush. "I daresay I am. I know
  you'll say it's absurd and unthinkable, and probably it is, but I can't help
  my feelings."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's absurd at all."</p>

  <p>The argument seemed to have sailed into a harbor after many buffetings,
  and Conway added: "I can't help MY feelings either. You and that girl happen
  to be the two people in the world I care most about... though you may think
  it odd of me." Abruptly he got up and paced the room. "We've said all we CAN
  say, haven't we?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose we have." But Mallinson went on, in a sudden rush of
  eagerness. "Oh, what stupid nonsense it all is&mdash;about her not being
  young! And foul and horrible nonsense, too. Conway, you CAN'T believe it!
  It's just too ridiculous. How can it really mean anything?"</p>

  <p>"How can you really know that she's young?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson half-turned away, his face lit with a grave shyness. "Because I
  DO know... Perhaps you'll think less of me for it... but I DO know. I'm
  afraid you never properly understood her, Conway. She was cold on the
  surface, but that was the result of living here&mdash;it had frozen all the
  warmth. But the warmth was there."</p>

  <p>"To be unfrozen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... that would be one way of putting it."</p>

  <p>"And she's YOUNG, Mallinson&mdash;you are so SURE of that?"</p>

  <p>Mallinson answered softly: "God, yes&mdash;she's just a girl. I was
  terribly sorry for her, and we were both attracted, I suppose. I don't see
  that it's anything to be ashamed of. In fact in a place like this I should
  think it's about the decentest thing that's ever happened..."</p>

  <p>Conway went to the balcony and gazed at the dazzling plume of Karakal; the
  moon was riding high in a waveless ocean. It came to him that a dream had
  dissolved, like all too lovely things, at the first touch of reality; that
  the whole world's future, weighed in the balance against youth and love,
  would be light as air. And he knew, too, that his mind dwelt in a world of
  its own, Shangri-La in microcosm, and that this world also was in peril. For
  even as he nerved himself, he saw the corridors of his imagination twist and
  strain under impact; the pavilions were toppling; all was about to be in
  ruins. He was only partly unhappy, but he was infinitely and rather sadly
  perplexed. He did not know whether he had been mad and was now sane, or had
  been sane for a time and now mad again.</p>

  <p>When he turned, there was a difference in him; his voice was keener,
  almost brusque, and his face twitched a little; he looked much more the
  Conway who had been a hero at Baskul. Clenched for action, he faced Mallinson
  with a sudden new alertness. "Do you think you could manage that tricky bit
  with a rope if I were with you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mallinson sprang forward. "CONWAY!" he cried chokingly. "You mean you'll
  COME? You've made up your mind at last?"</p>

  <p>They left as soon as Conway had prepared himself for the journey. It was
  surprisingly simple to leave&mdash;a departure rather than an escape; there
  were no incidents as they crossed the bars of moonlight and shadow in the
  courtyards. One might have thought there was no one there at all, Conway
  reflected; and immediately the idea of such emptiness became an emptiness in
  himself; while all the time, though he hardly heard him, Mallinson was
  chattering about the journey. How strange that their long argument should
  have ended thus in action, that this secret sanctuary should be forsaken by
  one who had found in it such happiness! For indeed, less than an hour later,
  they halted breathlessly at a curve of the track and saw the last of
  Shangri-La. Deep below them the valley of Blue Moon was like a cloud, and to
  Conway the scattered roofs had a look of floating after him through the haze.
  Now, at that moment, it was farewell. Mallinson, whom the steep ascent had
  kept silent for a time, gasped out: "Good man, we're doing fine&mdash;carry
  on!"</p>

  <p>Conway smiled, but did not reply; he was already preparing the rope for
  the knife-edge traverse. It was true, as the youth had said, that he had made
  up his mind; but it was only what was left of his mind. That small and active
  fragment now dominated; the rest comprised an absence hardly to be endured.
  He was a wanderer between two worlds and must ever wander; but for the
  present, in a deepening inward void, all he felt was that he liked Mallinson
  and must help him; he was doomed, like millions, to flee from wisdom and be a
  hero.</p>

  <p>Mallinson was nervous at the precipice, but Conway got him over in
  traditional mountaineering fashion, and when the trial was past, they leaned
  together over Mallinson's cigarettes. "Conway, I must say it's damned good of
  you... Perhaps you guess how I feel... I can't tell you how glad I am..."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't try, then, if I were you."</p>

  <p>After a long pause, and before they resumed the journey, Mallinson added:
  "But I AM glad&mdash;not only for my own sake, but for yours as well... It's
  fine that you can realize now that all that stuff was sheer nonsense... it's
  just wonderful to see you your real self again..."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," responded Conway, with a wryness that was for his own
  private comforting.</p>

  <p>Towards dawn they crossed the divide, unchallenged by sentinels, even if
  there were any; though it occurred to Conway that the route, in the true
  spirit, might only be moderately well watched. Presently they reached the
  plateau, picked clean as a bone by roaring winds, and after a gradual descent
  the encampment of porters came in sight. Then all was as Mallinson had
  foretold; they found the men ready for them, sturdy fellows in furs and
  sheepskins, crouching under the gale and eager to begin the journey to
  Tatsien-Fu&mdash;eleven hundred miles eastward on the China border.</p>

  <p>"He's coming with us!" Mallinson cried excitedly when they met Lo-Tsen. He
  forgot that she knew no English; but Conway translated.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the little Manchu had never looked so radiant. She
  gave him a most charming smile, but her eyes were all for the boy.</p>

  <p>EPILOGUE</p>

  <p>It was in Delhi that I met Rutherford again. We had been guests at a
  Viceregal dinner party, but distance and ceremonial kept us apart until the
  turbaned flunkeys handed us our hats afterwards. "Come back to my hotel and
  have a drink," he invited.</p>

  <p>We shared a cab along the arid miles between the Lutyens still life and
  the warm, palpitating motion picture of Old Delhi. I knew from the newspapers
  that he had just returned from Kashgar. His was one of those well-groomed
  reputations that get the most out of everything; any unusual holiday acquires
  the character of an exploration, and though the explorer takes care to do
  nothing really original, the public does not know this, and he capitalizes
  the full value of a hasty impression. It had not seemed to me, for instance,
  that Rutherford's journey, as reported in the press, had been particularly
  epoch-making; the buried cities of Khotan were old stuff, if anyone
  remembered Stein and Sven Hedin. I knew Rutherford well enough to chaff him
  about this, and he laughed. "Yes, the truth would have made a better story,"
  he admitted cryptically.</p>

  <p>We went to his hotel room and drank whisky. "So you DID search for
  Conway?" I suggested when the moment seemed propitious.</p>

  <p>"Search is much too strong a word," he answered. "You can't search a
  country half as big as Europe for one man. All I can say is that I have
  visited places where I was prepared to come across him or to get news of him.
  His last message, you remember, was that he had left Bangkok for the
  northwest. There were traces of him up-country for a little way, and my own
  opinion is that he probably made for the tribal districts on the Chinese
  border. I don't think he'd have cared to enter Burma, where he might have run
  up against British officials. Anyhow, the definite trail, you may say, peters
  out somewhere in Upper Siam, but of course I never expected to follow it that
  far."</p>

  <p>"You thought it might be easier to look for the valley of Blue Moon?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it did seem as if it might be a more fixed proposition. I suppose
  you glanced at that manuscript of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Much more than glanced at it. I should have returned it, by the way, but
  you left no address."</p>

  <p>Rutherford nodded. "I wonder what you made of it?"</p>

  <p>"I thought it very remarkable&mdash;assuming, of course, that it's all
  quite genuinely based on what Conway told you."</p>

  <p>"I give you my solemn word for that. I invented nothing at
  all&mdash;indeed, there's even less of my own language in it than you might
  think. I've got a good memory, and Conway always had a way of describing
  things. Don't forget that we had about twenty-four hours of practically
  continuous talk."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I said, it's all very remarkable."</p>

  <p>He leaned back and smiled. "If that's all you're going to say, I can see I
  shall have to speak for myself. I suppose you consider me a rather credulous
  person. I don't really think I am. People make mistakes in life through
  believing too much, but they have a damned dull time if they believe too
  little. I was certainly taken with Conway's story&mdash;in more ways than
  one&mdash;and that was why I felt interested enough to put as many tabs on it
  as I could&mdash;apart from the chance of running up against the man
  himself."</p>

  <p>He went on, after lighting a cigar. "It meant a good deal of odd
  journeying, but I like that sort of thing, and my publishers can't object to
  a travel book once in a while. Altogether I must have done some thousands of
  miles&mdash;Baskul, Bangkok, Chung-Kiang, Kashgar&mdash;I visited them all,
  and somewhere inside the area between them the mystery lies. But it's a
  pretty big area, you know, and all my investigations didn't touch more than
  the fringe of it&mdash;or of the mystery either, for that matter. Indeed, if
  you want the actual downright facts about Conway's adventures, so far as I've
  been able to verify them, all I can tell you is that he left Baskul on the
  twentieth of May and arrived in Chung-Kiang on the fifth of October. And the
  last we know of him is that he left Bangkok again on the third of February.
  All the rest is probability, possibility, guesswork, myth, legend, whatever
  you like to call it."</p>

  <p>"So you didn't find anything in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I never got into Tibet at all. The people up at
  Government House wouldn't hear of it; it's as much as they'll do to sanction
  an Everest expedition, and when I said I thought of wandering about the
  Kuen-Luns on my own, they looked at me rather as if I'd suggested writing a
  life of Gandhi. As a matter of fact, they knew more than I did. Strolling
  about Tibet isn't a one-man job; it needs an expedition properly fitted out
  and run by someone who knows at least a word or two of the language. I
  remember when Conway was telling me his story I kept wondering why there was
  all that fuss about waiting for porters&mdash;why didn't they simply walk
  off? I wasn't very long in discovering. The government people were quite
  right&mdash;all the passports in the world couldn't have got me over the
  Kuen-Luns. I actually went as far as seeing them in the distance, on a very
  clear day&mdash;perhaps fifty miles off. Not many Europeans can claim even
  that."</p>

  <p>"Are they so very forbidding?"</p>

  <p>"They looked just like a white frieze on the horizon, that was all. At
  Yarkand and Kashgar I questioned everyone I met about them, but it was
  extraordinary how little I could discover. I should think they must be the
  least-explored range in the world. I had the luck to meet an American
  traveler who had once tried to cross them, but he'd been unable to find a
  pass. There ARE passes, he said, but they're terrifically high and unmapped.
  I asked him if he thought it possible for a valley to exist of the kind
  Conway described, and he said he wouldn't call it impossible, but he thought
  it not very likely&mdash;on geological grounds, at any rate. Then I asked if
  he had ever heard of a cone-shaped mountain almost as high as the highest of
  the Himalayas, and his answer to that was rather intriguing. There was a
  legend, he said, about such a mountain, but he thought himself there could be
  no foundation for it. There were even rumors, he added, about mountains
  actually higher than Everest, but he didn't himself give credit to them. 'I
  doubt if any peak in the Kuen-Luns is more than twenty-five thousand feet, if
  that,' he said. But he admitted that they had never been properly
  surveyed.</p>

  <p>"Then I asked him what he knew about Tibetan lamaseries&mdash;he'd been in
  the country several times&mdash;and he gave me just the usual accounts that
  one can read in all the books. They weren't beautiful places, he assured me,
  and the monks in them were generally corrupt and dirty. 'Do they live long?'
  I asked, and he said, yes, they often did, if they didn't die of some filthy
  disease. Then I went boldly to the point and asked if he'd ever heard legends
  of extreme longevity among the lamas. 'Heaps of them,' he answered: 'it's one
  of the stock yarns you hear everywhere, but you can't verify them. You're
  told that some foul-looking creature has been walled up in a cell for a
  hundred years, and he certainly looks as if he might have been, but of course
  you can't demand his birth certificate.' I asked him if he thought they had
  any occult or medicinal way of prolonging life or preserving youth, and he
  said they were supposed to have a great deal of very curious knowledge about
  such things, but he suspected that if you came to look into it, it was rather
  like the Indian rope trick&mdash;always something that somebody else had
  seen. He did say, however, that the lamas appeared to have odd powers of
  bodily control. 'I've watched them,' he said, 'sitting by the edge of a
  frozen lake, stark naked, with a temperature below zero and in a tearing
  wind, while their servants break the ice and wrap sheets round them that have
  been dipped in the water. They do this a dozen times or more, and the lamas
  dry the sheets on their own bodies. Keeping warm by willpower, so one
  imagines, though that's a poor sort of explanation.'"</p>

  <p>Rutherford helped himself to more drink. "But of course, as my American
  friend admitted, all that had nothing much to do with longevity. It merely
  showed that the lamas had somber tastes in self-discipline... So there we
  were, and probably you'll agree with me that all the evidence, so far, was
  less than you'd hang a dog on."</p>

  <p>I said it was certainly inconclusive, and asked if the names Karakal and
  Shangri-La had meant anything to the American.</p>

  <p>"Not a thing&mdash;I tried him with them. After I'd gone on questioning
  him for a time, he said: 'Frankly, I'm not keen on monasteries&mdash; indeed,
  I once told a fellow I met in Tibet that if I went out of my way at all, it
  would be to avoid them, not pay them a visit.' That chance remark of his gave
  me a curious idea, and I asked him when this meeting in Tibet had taken
  place. 'Oh, a long time ago,' he answered, 'before the war&mdash;in
  nineteen-eleven, I think it was.' I badgered him for further details, and he
  gave them, as well as he could remember. It seemed that he'd been traveling
  then for some American geographical society, with several colleagues,
  porters, and so on&mdash;in fact, a pukka expedition. Somewhere near the
  Kuen-Luns he met this other man, a Chinese who was being carried in a chair
  by native bearers. The fellow turned out to speak English quite well, and
  strongly recommended them to visit a certain lamasery in the neighborhood
  &mdash;he even offered to be the guide there. The American said they hadn't
  time and weren't interested, and that was that." Rutherford went on, after an
  interval: "I don't suggest that it means a great deal. When a man tries to
  remember a casual incident that happened twenty years ago, you can't build
  too much on it. But it offers an attractive speculation."</p>

  <p>"Yes, though if a well-equipped expedition had accepted the invitation, I
  don't see how they could have been detained at the lamasery against their
  will."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite. And perhaps it wasn't Shangri-La at all."</p>

  <p>We thought it over, but it seemed too hazy for argument, and I went on to
  ask if there had been any discoveries at Baskul.</p>

  <p>"Baskul was hopeless, and Peshawar was worse. Nobody could tell me
  anything, except that the kidnaping of the aeroplane did undoubtedly take
  place. They weren't keen even to admit that&mdash;it's an episode they're not
  proud of."</p>

  <p>"And nothing was heard of the plane afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word or a rumor, or of its four passengers either. I verified,
  however, that it was capable of climbing high enough to cross the ranges. I
  also tried to trace that fellow Barnard, but I found his past history so
  mysterious that I wouldn't be at all surprised if he really were Chalmers
  Bryant, as Conway said. After all, Bryant's complete disappearance in the
  midst of the big hue and cry was rather amazing."</p>

  <p>"Did you try to find anything about the actual kidnaper?"</p>

  <p>"I did. But again it was hopeless. The air force man whom the fellow had
  knocked out and impersonated had since been killed, so one promising line of
  enquiry was closed. I even wrote to a friend of mine in America who runs an
  aviation school, asking if he had had any Tibetan pupils lately, but his
  reply was prompt and disappointing. He said he couldn't differentiate
  Tibetans from Chinese, and he had had about fifty of the latter&mdash;all
  training to fight the Japs. Not much chance there, you see. But I did make
  one rather quaint discovery&mdash;and which I could have made just as easily
  without leaving London. There was a German professor at Jena about the middle
  of the last century who took to globe-trotting and visited Tibet in 1887. He
  never came back, and there was some story about him having been drowned in
  fording a river. His name was Friedrich Meister."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens&mdash;one of the names Conway mentioned!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;though it may only have been coincidence. It doesn't prove the
  whole story, by any means, because the Jena fellow was born in 1845. Nothing
  very exciting about that."</p>

  <p>"But it's odd," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it's odd enough."</p>

  <p>"Did you succeed in tracing any of the others?"</p>

  <p>"No. It's a pity I hadn't a longer list to work on. I couldn't find any
  record of a pupil of Chopin's called Briac, though of course that doesn't
  prove that there wasn't one. Conway was pretty sparing with his names, when
  you come to think about it&mdash;out of fifty-odd lamas supposed to be on the
  premises he only gave us one or two. Perrault and Henschell, by the way,
  proved equally impossible to trace."</p>

  <p>"How about Mallinson?" I asked. "Did you try to find out what happened to
  him? And that girl&mdash;the Chinese girl?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, of course I did. The awkward part was, as you perhaps
  gathered from the manuscript, that Conway's story ended at the moment of
  leaving the valley with the porters. After that he either couldn't or
  wouldn't tell what happened&mdash;perhaps he might have done, mind you, if
  there'd been more time. I feel that we can guess at some sort of tragedy. The
  hardships of the journey would be perfectly appalling, apart from the risk of
  brigandage or even treachery among their own escorting party. Probably we
  shall never know exactly what did occur, but it seems tolerably certain that
  Mallinson never reached China. I made all sorts of enquiries, you know. First
  of all I tried to trace details of books, et cetera, sent in large
  consignments across the Tibetan frontier, but at all the likely places, such
  as Shanghai and Pekin, I drew complete blanks. That, of course, doesn't count
  for much, since the lamas would doubtless see that their methods of
  importation were kept secret. Then I tried at Tatsien-Fu. It's a weird place,
  a sort of world's-end market town, deuced difficult to get at, where the
  Chinese coolies from Yunnan transfer their loads of tea to the Tibetans. You
  can read about it in my new book when it comes out. Europeans don't often get
  as far. I found the people quite civil and courteous, but there was
  absolutely no record of Conway's party arriving at all."</p>

  <p>"So how Conway himself reached Chung-Kiang is still unexplained?"</p>

  <p>"The only conclusion is that he wandered there, just as he might have
  wandered anywhere else. Anyhow, we're back in the realm of hard facts when we
  get to Chung-Kiang, that's something. The nuns at the mission hospital were
  genuine enough, and so, for that matter, was Sieveking's excitement on the
  ship when Conway played that pseudo-Chopin." Rutherford paused and then added
  reflectively: "It's really an exercise in the balancing of probabilities, and
  I must say the scales don't bump very emphatically either way. Of course if
  you don't accept Conway's story, it means that you doubt either his veracity
  or his sanity&mdash;one may as well be frank."</p>

  <p>He paused again, as if inviting a comment, and I said: "As you know, I
  never saw him after the war, but people said he was a good deal changed by
  it."</p>

  <p>Rutherford answered: "Yes, and he was, there's no denying the fact. You
  can't subject a mere boy to three years of intense physical and emotional
  stress without tearing something to tatters. People would say, I suppose,
  that he came through without a scratch. But the scratches were there&mdash;on
  the inside."</p>

  <p>We talked for a little time about the war and its effects on various
  people, and at length he went on: "But there's just one more point that I
  must mention&mdash;and perhaps in some ways the oddest of all. It came out
  during my enquiries at the mission. They all did their best for me there, as
  you can guess, but they couldn't recollect much, especially as they'd been so
  busy with a fever epidemic at the time. One of the questions I put was about
  the manner Conway had reached the hospital first of all&mdash;whether he had
  presented himself alone, or had been found ill and been taken there by
  someone else. They couldn't exactly remember&mdash;after all, it was a long
  while back&mdash;but suddenly, when I was on the point of giving up the
  cross-examination, one of the nuns remarked quite casually, 'I think the
  doctor said he was brought here by a woman.' That was all she could tell me,
  and as the doctor himself had left the mission, there was no confirmation to
  be had on the spot.</p>

  <p>"But having got so far, I wasn't in any mood to give up. It appeared that
  the doctor had gone to a bigger hospital in Shanghai, so I took the trouble
  to get his address and call on him there. It was just after the Jap air
  raiding, and things were pretty grim. I'd met the man before during my first
  visit to Chung-Kiang, and he was very polite, though terribly overworked
  &mdash;yes, terribly's the word, for, believe me, the air raids on London by
  the Germans were just nothing to what the Japs did to the native parts of
  Shanghai. Oh, yes, he said instantly, he remembered the case of the
  Englishman who had lost his memory. Was it true he had been brought to the
  mission hospital by a woman? I asked. Oh, yes, certainly, by a woman, a
  Chinese woman. Did he remember anything about her? Nothing, he answered,
  except that she had been ill of the fever herself, and had died almost
  immediately... Just then there was an interruption&mdash;a batch of wounded
  were carried in and packed on stretchers in the corridors&mdash;the wards
  were all full&mdash;and I didn't care to go on taking up the man's time,
  especially as the thudding of the guns at Woosung was a reminder that he
  would still have plenty to do. When he came back to me, looking quite
  cheerful even amidst such ghastliness, I just asked him one final question,
  and I daresay you can guess what it was. 'About that Chinese woman,' I said.
  'Was she young?'"</p>

  <p>Rutherford flicked his cigar as if the narration had excited him quite as
  much as he hoped it had me. Continuing, he said: "The little fellow looked at
  me solemnly for a moment, and then answered in that funny clipped English
  that the educated Chinese have&mdash;'Oh, no, she was most old&mdash;most old
  of anyone I have ever seen.'"</p>

  <p>We sat for a long time in silence, and then talked again of Conway as I
  remembered him, boyish and gifted and full of charm, and of the war that had
  altered him, and of so many mysteries of time and age and of the mind, and of
  the little Manchu who had been "most old," and of the strange ultimate dream
  of Blue Moon. "Do you think he will ever find it?" I asked.</p>
