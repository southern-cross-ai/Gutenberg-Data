<h2>Men, Women, and Boats<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Stephen Crane</h2>

<h3>Edited With an Introduction by Vincent Starrett<br>
<br>
The Modern Library<br>
New York<br>
Published 1921</h3>

<hr>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>A Number of the tales and sketches here brought together appear
now for the first time between covers; others for the first time
between covers in this country. All have been gathered from
out-of-print volumes and old magazine files.</p>

<p>"The Open Boat," one of Stephen Crane's finest stories, is used
with the courteous permission of Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., holders
of the copyright. Its companion masterpiece, "The Blue Hotel,"
because of copyright complications, has had to be omitted, greatly
to the regret of the editor.</p>

<p>After the death of Stephen Crane, a haphazard and
undiscriminating gathering of his earlier tales and sketches
appeared in London under the misleading title, "Last Words." From
this volume, now rarely met with, a number of characteristic minor
works have been selected, and these will be new to Crane's American
admirers; as follows: "The Reluctant Voyagers," "The End of the
Battle," "The Upturned Face," "An Episode of War," "A Desertion,"
"Four Men in a Cave," "The Mesmeric Mountain," "London
Impressions," "The Snake."</p>

<p>Three of our present collection, printed by arrangement,
appeared in the London (1898) edition of "The Open Boat and Other
Stories," published by William Heinemann, but did not occur in the
American volume of that title. They are "An Experiment in Misery,"
"The Duel that was not Fought," and "The Pace of Youth."</p>

<p>For the rest, "A Dark Brown Dog," "A Tent in Agony," and "The
Scotch Express," are here printed for the first time in a book.</p>

<p>For the general title of the present collection, the editor
alone is responsible.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Stephen Crane: <i>An
Estimate</i></h2>

<p>It hardly profits us to conjecture what Stephen Crane might have
written about the World War had he lived. Certainly, he would have
been in it, in one capacity or another. No man had a greater talent
for war and personal adventure, nor a finer art in describing it.
Few writers of recent times could so well describe the poetry of
motion as manifested in the surge and flow of battle, or so well
depict the isolated deed of heroism in its stark simplicity and
terror.</p>

<p>To such an undertaking as Henri Barbusse's "Under Fire," that
powerful, brutal book, Crane would have brought an analytical
genius almost clairvoyant. He possessed an uncanny vision; a
descriptive ability photographic in its clarity and its care for
minutiae&mdash;yet unphotographic in that the big central thing
often is omitted, to be felt rather than seen in the occult
suggestion of detail. Crane would have seen and depicted the grisly
horror of it all, as did Barbusse, but also he would have seen the
glory and the ecstasy and the wonder of it, and over that his
poetry would have been spread.</p>

<p>While Stephen Crane was an excellent psychologist, he was also a
true poet. Frequently his prose was finer poetry than his
deliberate essays in poesy. His most famous book, "The Red Badge of
Courage," is essentially a psychological study, a delicate clinical
dissection of the soul of a recruit, but it is also a <i>tour de
force</i> of the imagination. When he wrote the book he had never
seen a battle: he had to place himself in the situation of another.
Years later, when he came out of the Greco-Turkish <i>fracas</i>,
he remarked to a friend: "'The Red Badge' is all right."</p>

<p>Written by a youth who had scarcely passed his majority, this
book has been compared with Tolstoy's "Sebastopol" and Zola's "La
Débâcle," and with some of the short stories of Ambrose Bierce. The
comparison with Bierce's work is legitimate; with the other books,
I think, less so. Tolstoy and Zola see none of the traditional
beauty of battle; they apply themselves to a devoted&mdash;almost
obscene&mdash;study of corpses and carnage generally; and they lack
the American's instinct for the rowdy commonplace, the natural, the
irreverent, which so materially aids his realism. In "The Red Badge
of Courage" invariably the tone is kept down where one expects a
height: the most heroic deeds are accomplished with studied
awkwardness.</p>

<p>Crane was an obscure free-lance when he wrote this book. The
effort, he says, somewhere, "was born of pain&mdash;despair,
almost." It was a better piece of work, however, for that very
reason, as Crane knew. It is far from flawless. It has been
remarked that it bristles with as many grammatical errors as with
bayonets; but it is a big canvas, and I am certain that many of
Crane's deviations from the rules of polite rhetoric were
deliberate experiments, looking to effect&mdash;effect which,
frequently, he gained.</p>

<p>Stephen Crane "arrived" with this book. There are, of course,
many who never have heard of him, to this day, but there was a time
when he was very much talked of. That was in the middle nineties,
following publication of "The Red Badge of Courage," although even
before that he had occasioned a brief flurry with his weird
collection of poems called "The Black Riders and Other Lines." He
was highly praised, and highly abused and laughed at; but he seemed
to be "made." We have largely forgotten since. It is a way we
have.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer his short stories to his novels and his
poems; those, for instance, contained in "The Open Boat," in
"Wounds in the Rain," and in "The Monster." The title-story in that
first collection is perhaps his finest piece of work. Yet what is
it? A truthful record of an adventure of his own in the
filibustering days that preceded our war with Spain; the faithful
narrative of the voyage of an open boat, manned by a handful of
shipwrecked men. But Captain Bligh's account of <i>his</i> small
boat journey, after he had been sent adrift by the mutineers of the
<i>Bounty</i>, seems tame in comparison, although of the two the
English sailor's voyage was the more perilous.</p>

<p>In "The Open Boat" Crane again gains his effects by keeping down
the tone where another writer might have attempted "fine writing"
and have been lost. In it perhaps is most strikingly evident the
poetic cadences of his prose: its rhythmic, monotonous flow is the
flow of the gray water that laps at the sides of the boat, that
rises and recedes in cruel waves, "like little pointed rocks." It
is a desolate picture, and the tale is one of our greatest short
stories. In the other tales that go to make up the volume are wild,
exotic glimpses of Latin-America. I doubt whether the color and
spirit of that region have been better rendered than in Stephen
Crane's curious, distorted, staccato sentences.</p>

<p>"War Stories" is the laconic sub-title of "Wounds in the Rain."
It was not war on a grand scale that Crane saw in the
Spanish-American complication, in which he participated as a war
correspondent; no such war as the recent horror. But the occasions
for personal heroism were no fewer than always, and the
opportunities for the exercise of such powers of trained and
appreciative understanding and sympathy as Crane possessed, were
abundant. For the most part, these tales are episodic, reports of
isolated instances&mdash;the profanely humorous experiences of
correspondents, the magnificent courage of signalmen under fire,
the forgotten adventure of a converted yacht&mdash;but all are
instinct with the red fever of war, and are backgrounded with the
choking smoke of battle. Never again did Crane attempt the large
canvas of "The Red Badge of Courage." Before he had seen war, he
imagined its immensity and painted it with the fury and fidelity of
a Verestchagin; when he was its familiar, he singled out its minor,
crimson passages for briefer but no less careful delineation.</p>

<p>In this book, again, his sense of the poetry of motion is
vividly evident. We see men going into action, wave on wave, or in
scattering charges; we hear the clink of their accoutrements and
their breath whistling through their teeth. They are not men going
into action at all, but men going about their business, which at
the moment happens to be the capture of a trench. They are neither
heroes nor cowards. Their faces reflect no particular emotion save,
perhaps, a desire to get somewhere. They are a line of men running
for a train, or following a fire engine, or charging a trench. It
is a relentless picture, ever changing, ever the same. But it
contains poetry, too, in rich, memorable passages.</p>

<p>In "The Monster and Other Stories," there is a tale called "The
Blue Hotel". A Swede, its central figure, toward the end manages to
get himself murdered. Crane's description of it is just as casual
as that. The story fills a dozen pages of the book; but the social
injustice of the whole world is hinted in that space; the
upside-downness of creation, right prostrate, wrong
triumphant,&mdash;a mad, crazy world. The incident of the murdered
Swede is just part of the backwash of it all, but it is an
illuminating fragment. The Swede was slain, not by the gambler
whose knife pierced his thick hide: he was the victim of a
condition for which he was no more to blame than the man who
stabbed him. Stephen Crane thus speaks through the lips of one of
the characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">"We are all in it! This poor gambler isn't even a
noun. He is a kind of an adverb. Every sin is the result of a
collaboration. We, five of us, have collaborated in the murder of
this Swede. Usually there are from a dozen to forty women really
involved in every murder, but in this case it seems to be only five
men&mdash;you, I, Johnnie, Old Scully, and that fool of an
unfortunate gambler came merely as a culmination, the apex of a
human movement, and gets all the punishment."</p>

<p>And then this typical and arresting piece of irony:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">"The corpse of the Swede, alone in the saloon, had
its eyes fixed upon a dreadful legend that dwelt atop of the
cash-machine: 'This registers the amount of your purchase.'"</p>

<p>In "The Monster," the ignorance, prejudice and cruelty of an
entire community are sharply focussed. The realism is painful; one
blushes for mankind. But while this story really belongs in the
volume called "Whilomville Stories," it is properly left out of
that series. The Whilomville stories are pure comedy, and "The
Monster" is a hideous tragedy.</p>

<p>Whilomville is any obscure little village one may happen to
think of. To write of it with such sympathy and understanding,
Crane must have done some remarkable listening in Boyville. The
truth is, of course, he was a boy himself&mdash;"a wonderful boy,"
somebody called him&mdash;and was possessed of the boy mind. These
tales are chiefly funny because they are so true&mdash;boy stories
written for adults; a child, I suppose, would find them dull. In
none of his tales is his curious understanding of human moods and
emotions better shown.</p>

<p>A stupid critic once pointed out that Crane, in his search for
striking effects, had been led into "frequent neglect of the
time-hallowed rights of certain words," and that in his pursuit of
color he "falls occasionally into almost ludicrous mishap." The
smug pedantry of the quoted lines is sufficient answer to the
charges, but in support of these assertions the critic quoted
certain passages and phrases. He objected to cheeks "scarred" by
tears, to "dauntless" statues, and to "terror-stricken" wagons. The
very touches of poetic impressionism that largely make for Crane's
greatness, are cited to prove him an ignoramus. There is the finest
of poetic imagery in the suggestions subtly conveyed by Crane's
tricky adjectives, the use of which was as deliberate with him as
his choice of a subject. But Crane was an imagist before our modern
imagists were known.</p>

<p>This unconventional use of adjectives is marked in the
Whilomville tales. In one of them Crane refers to the "solemn odor
of burning turnips." It is the most nearly perfect characterization
of burning turnips conceivable: can anyone improve upon that
"solemn odor"?</p>

<p>Stephen Crane's first venture was "Maggie: A Girl of the
Streets." It was, I believe, the first hint of naturalism in
American letters. It was not a best-seller; it offers no solution
of life; it is an episodic bit of slum fiction, ending with the
tragic finality of a Greek drama. It is a skeleton of a novel
rather than a novel, but it is a powerful outline, written about a
life Crane had learned to know as a newspaper reporter in New York.
It is a singularly fine piece of analysis, or a bit of
extraordinarily faithful reporting, as one may prefer; but not a
few French and Russian writers have failed to accomplish in two
volumes what Crane achieved in two hundred pages. In the same
category is "George's Mother," a triumph of inconsequential detail
piling up with a cumulative effect quite overwhelming.</p>

<p>Crane published two volumes of poetry&mdash;"The Black Riders"
and "War is Kind." Their appearance in print was jeeringly hailed;
yet Crane was only pioneering in the free verse that is today, if
not definitely accepted, at least more than tolerated. I like the
following love poem as well as any rhymed and conventionally
metrical ballad that I know:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Should the wide world roll away,<br>
Leaving black terror,<br>
Limitless night,<br>
Nor God, nor man, nor place to stand<br>
Would be to me essential,<br>
If thou and thy white arms were there<br>
And the fall to doom a long way."</p>

<p>"If war be kind," wrote a clever reviewer, when the second
volume appeared, "then Crane's verse may be poetry, Beardsley's
black and white creations may be art, and this may be called a
book";&mdash;a smart summing up that is cherished by cataloguers to
this day, in describing the volume for collectors. Beardsley needs
no defenders, and it is fairly certain that the clever reviewer had
not read the book, for certainly Crane had no illusions about the
kindness of war. The title-poem of the volume is an amazingly
beautiful satire which answers all criticism.</p>

<p class="poem">"Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind.<br>
Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky<br>
And the affrighted steed ran on alone,<br>
Do not weep.<br>
War is kind.<br>
<br>
"Hoarse, booming drums of the regiment,<br>
Little souls who thirst for fight,<br>
These men were born to drill and die.<br>
The unexplained glory flies above them,<br>
Great is the battle-god, and his kingdom&mdash;<br>
A field where a thousand corpses lie.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
"Mother whose heart hung humble as a button<br>
On the bright splendid shroud of your son,<br>
Do not weep.<br>
War is kind."</p>

<p>Poor Stephen Crane! Like most geniuses, he had his weaknesses
and his failings; like many, if not most, geniuses, he was ill. He
died of tuberculosis, tragically young. But what a comrade he must
have been, with his extraordinary vision, his keen, sardonic
comment, his fearlessness and his failings!</p>

<p>Just a glimpse of Crane's last days is afforded by a letter
written from England by Robert Barr, his friend&mdash;Robert Barr,
who collaborated with Crane in "The O' Ruddy," a rollicking tale of
old Ireland, or, rather, who completed it at Crane's death, to
satisfy his friend's earnest request. The letter is dated from
Hillhead, Woldingham, Surrey, June 8, 1900, and runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"My Dear &mdash;&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I was delighted to hear from you, and was much interested to see
the article on Stephen Crane you sent me. It seems to me the harsh
judgment of an unappreciative, commonplace person on a man of
genius. Stephen had many qualities which lent themselves to
misapprehension, but at the core he was the finest of men, generous
to a fault, with something of the old-time recklessness which used
to gather in the ancient literary taverns of London. I always
fancied that Edgar Allan Poe revisited the earth as Stephen Crane,
trying again, succeeding again, failing again, and dying ten years
sooner than he did on the other occasion of his stay on earth.<br>
<br>
"When your letter came I had just returned from Dover, where I
stayed four days to see Crane off for the Black Forest. There was a
thin thread of hope that he might recover, but to me he looked like
a man already dead. When he spoke, or, rather, whispered, there was
all the accustomed humor in his sayings. I said to him that I would
go over to the Schwarzwald in a few weeks, when he was getting
better, and that we would take some convalescent rambles together.
As his wife was listening he said faintly: 'I'll look forward to
that,' but he smiled at me, and winked slowly, as much as to say:
'You damned humbug, you know I'll take no more rambles in this
world.' Then, as if the train of thought suggested what was looked
on before as the crisis of his illness, he murmured: 'Robert, when
you come to the hedge&mdash;that we must all go over&mdash; it
isn't bad. You feel sleepy&mdash;and&mdash;you don't care. Just a
little dreamy curiosity&mdash;which world you're really
in&mdash;that's all.'<br>
<br>
"To-morrow, Saturday, the 9th, I go again to Dover to meet his
body. He will rest for a little while in England, a country that
was always good to him, then to America, and his journey will be
ended.<br>
<br>
"I've got the unfinished manuscript of his last novel here beside
me, a rollicking Irish tale, different from anything he ever wrote
before. Stephen thought I was the only person who could finish it,
and he was too ill for me to refuse. I don't know what to do about
the matter, for I never could work up another man's ideas. Even
your vivid imagination could hardly conjecture anything more
ghastly than the dying man, lying by an open window overlooking the
English channel, relating in a sepulchral whisper the comic
situations of his humorous hero so that I might take up the thread
of his story.<br>
<br>
"From the window beside which I write this I can see down in the
valley Ravensbrook House, where Crane used to live and where Harold
Frederic, he and I spent many a merry night together. When the
Romans occupied Britain, some of their legions, parched with
thirst, were wandering about these dry hills with the chance of
finding water or perishing. They watched the ravens, and so came to
the stream which rises under my place and flows past Stephen's
former home; hence the name, Ravensbrook.<br>
<br>
"It seems a strange coincidence that the greatest modern writer on
war should set himself down where the greatest ancient warrior,
Caesar, probably stopped to quench his thirst.<br>
<br>
"Stephen died at three in the morning, the same sinister hour which
carried away our friend Frederic nineteen months before. At
midnight, in Crane's fourteenth-century house in Sussex, we two
tried to lure back the ghost of Frederic into that house of ghosts,
and to our company, thinking that if reappearing were ever possible
so strenuous a man as Harold would somehow shoulder his way past
the guards, but he made no sign. I wonder if the less insistent
Stephen will suggest some ingenious method by which the two can
pass the barrier. I can imagine Harold cursing on the other side,
and welcoming the more subtle assistance of his finely fibred
friend.<br>
<br>
"I feel like the last of the Three Musketeers, the other two gone
down in their duel with Death. I am wondering if, within the next
two years, I also shall get the challenge. If so, I shall go to the
competing ground the more cheerfully that two such good fellows
await the outcome on the other side.<br>
<br>
"Ever your friend,<br>
<br>
"ROBERT BARR."</p>

<p>The last of the Three Musketeers is gone, now, although he
outlived his friends by some years. Robert Barr died in 1912.
Perhaps they are still debating a joint return.</p>

<p>There could be, perhaps, no better close for a paper on Stephen
Crane than the subjoined paragraph from a letter written by him to
a Rochester editor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"The one thing that deeply pleases me is the fact
that men of sense invariably believe me to be sincere. I know that
my work does not amount to a string of dried beans&mdash;I always
calmly admit it&mdash;but I also know that I do the best that is in
me without regard to praise or blame. When I was the mark for every
humorist in the country, I went ahead; and now when I am the mark
for only fifty per cent of the humorists of the country, I go
ahead; for I understand that a man is born into the world with his
own pair of eyes, and he is not at all responsible for his
vision&mdash;he is merely responsible for his quality of personal
honesty. To keep close to this personal honesty is my supreme
ambition."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>The Open Boat</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>A Tale intended to be after the fact. Being the
experience of four men from the sunk steamer "Commodore"</b>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>None of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes glanced
level, and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them.
These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were
of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea.
The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all
times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in
points like rocks. Many a man ought to have a bath-tub larger than
the boat which here rode upon the sea. These waves were most
wrongfully and barbarously abrupt and tall, and each froth-top was
a problem in small-boat navigation.</p>

<p>The cook squatted in the bottom and looked with both eyes at the
six inches of gunwale which separated him from the ocean. His
sleeves were rolled over his fat forearms, and the two flaps of his
unbuttoned vest dangled as he bent to bail out the boat. Often he
said: "Gawd! That was a narrow clip." As he remarked it he
invariably gazed eastward over the broken sea.</p>

<p>The oiler, steering with one of the two oars in the boat,
sometimes raised himself suddenly to keep clear of water that
swirled in over the stern. It was a thin little oar and it seemed
often ready to snap.</p>

<p>The correspondent, pulling at the other oar, watched the waves
and wondered why he was there.</p>

<p>The injured captain, lying in the bow, was at this time buried
in that profound dejection and indifference which comes,
temporarily at least, to even the bravest and most enduring when,
willy nilly, the firm fails, the army loses, the ship goes down.
The mind of the master of a vessel is rooted deep in the timbers of
her, though he commanded for a day or a decade, and this captain
had on him the stern impression of a scene in the greys of dawn of
seven turned faces, and later a stump of a top-mast with a white
ball on it that slashed to and fro at the waves, went low and
lower, and down. Thereafter there was something strange in his
voice. Although steady, it was, deep with mourning, and of a
quality beyond oration or tears.</p>

<p>"Keep 'er a little more south, Billie," said he.</p>

<p>"'A little more south,' sir," said the oiler in the stern.</p>

<p>A seat in this boat was not unlike a seat upon a bucking
broncho, and by the same token, a broncho is not much smaller. The
craft pranced and reared, and plunged like an animal. As each wave
came, and she rose for it, she seemed like a horse making at a
fence outrageously high. The manner of her scramble over these
walls of water is a mystic thing, and, moreover, at the top of them
were ordinarily these problems in white water, the foam racing down
from the summit of each wave, requiring a new leap, and a leap from
the air. Then, after scornfully bumping a crest, she would slide,
and race, and splash down a long incline, and arrive bobbing and
nodding in front of the next menace.</p>

<p>A singular disadvantage of the sea lies in the fact that after
successfully surmounting one wave you discover that there is
another behind it just as important and just as nervously anxious
to do something effective in the way of swamping boats. In a
ten-foot dingey one can get an idea of the resources of the sea in
the line of waves that is not probable to the average experience
which is never at sea in a dingey. As each slatey wall of water
approached, it shut all else from the view of the men in the boat,
and it was not difficult to imagine that this particular wave was
the final outburst of the ocean, the last effort of the grim water.
There was a terrible grace in the move of the waves, and they came
in silence, save for the snarling of the crests.</p>

<p>In the wan light, the faces of the men must have been grey.
Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily
astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have
been weirdly picturesque. But the men in the boat had no time to
see it, and if they had had leisure there were other things to
occupy their minds. The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they
knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from
slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam
was like tumbling snow. The process of the breaking day was unknown
to them. They were aware only of this effect upon the color of the
waves that rolled toward them.</p>

<p>In disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent argued as
to the difference between a life-saving station and a house of
refuge. The cook had said: "There's a house of refuge just north of
the Mosquito Inlet Light, and as soon as they see us, they'll come
off in their boat and pick us up."</p>

<p>"As soon as who see us?" said the correspondent.</p>

<p>"The crew," said the cook.</p>

<p>"Houses of refuge don't have crews," said the correspondent. "As
I understand them, they are only places where clothes and grub are
stored for the benefit of shipwrecked people. They don't carry
crews."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they do," said the cook.</p>

<p>"No, they don't," said the correspondent.</p>

<p>"Well, we're not there yet, anyhow," said the oiler, in the
stern.</p>

<p>"Well," said the cook, "perhaps it's not a house of refuge that
I'm thinking of as being near Mosquito Inlet Light. Perhaps it's a
life-saving station."</p>

<p>"We're not there yet," said the oiler, in the stern.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>As the boat bounced from the top of each wave, the wind tore
through the hair of the hatless men, and as the craft plopped her
stern down again the spray splashed past them. The crest of each of
these waves was a hill, from the top of which the men surveyed, for
a moment, a broad tumultuous expanse, shining and wind-riven. It
was probably splendid. It was probably glorious, this play of the
free sea, wild with lights of emerald and white and amber.</p>

<p>"Bully good thing it's an on-shore wind," said the cook; "If
not, where would we be? Wouldn't have a show."</p>

<p>"That's right," said the correspondent.</p>

<p>The busy oiler nodded his assent.</p>

<p>Then the captain, in the bow, chuckled in a way that expressed
humor, contempt, tragedy, all in one. "Do you think We've got much
of a show now, boys?" said he.</p>

<p>Whereupon the three were silent, save for a trifle of hemming
and hawing. To express any particular optimism at this time they
felt to be childish and stupid, but they all doubtless possessed
this sense of the situation in their mind. A young man thinks
doggedly at such times. On the other hand, the ethics of their
condition was decidedly against any open suggestion of
hopelessness. So they were silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the captain, soothing his children, "We'll get
ashore all right."</p>

<p>But there was that in his tone which made them think, so the
oiler quoth: "Yes! If this wind holds!"</p>

<p>The cook was bailing: "Yes! If we don't catch hell in the
surf."</p>

<p>Canton flannel gulls flew near and far. Sometimes they sat down
on the sea, near patches of brown seaweed that rolled on the waves
with a movement like carpets on a line in a gale. The birds sat
comfortably in groups, and they were envied by some in the dingey,
for the wrath of the sea was no more to them than it was to a covey
of prairie chickens a thousand miles inland. Often they came very
close and stared at the men with black bead-like eyes. At these
times they were uncanny and sinister in their unblinking scrutiny,
and the men hooted angrily at them, telling them to be gone. One
came, and evidently decided to alight on the top of the captain's
head. The bird flew parallel to the boat and did not circle, but
made short sidelong jumps in the air in chicken-fashion. His black
eyes were wistfully fixed upon the captain's head. "Ugly brute,"
said the oiler to the bird. "You look as if you were made with a
jack-knife." The cook and the correspondent swore darkly at the
creature. The captain naturally wished to knock it away with the
end of the heavy painter; but he did not dare do it, because
anything resembling an emphatic gesture would have capsized this
freighted boat, and so with his open hand, the captain gently and
carefully waved the gull away. After it had been discouraged from
the pursuit the captain breathed easier on account of his hair, and
others breathed easier because the bird struck their minds at this
time as being somehow grewsome and ominous.</p>

<p>In the meantime the oiler and the correspondent rowed And also
they rowed.</p>

<p>They sat together in the same seat, and each rowed an oar. Then
the oiler took both oars; then the correspondent took both oars;
then the oiler; then the correspondent. They rowed and they rowed.
The very ticklish part of the business was when the time came for
the reclining one in the stern to take his turn at the oars. By the
very last star of truth, it is easier to steal eggs from under a
hen than it was to change seats in the dingey. First the man in the
stern slid his hand along the thwart and moved with care, as if he
were of Sèvres. Then the man in the rowing seat slid his hand along
the other thwart. It was all done with most extraordinary care. As
the two sidled past each other, the whole party kept watchful eyes
on the coming wave, and the captain cried: "Look out now! Steady
there!"</p>

<p>The brown mats of seaweed that appeared from time to time were
like islands, bits of earth. They were traveling, apparently,
neither one way nor the other. They were, to all intents,
stationary. They informed the men in the boat that it was making
progress slowly toward the land.</p>

<p>The captain, rearing cautiously in the bow, after the dingey
soared on a great swell, said that he had seen the light-house at
Mosquito Inlet. Presently the cook remarked that he had seen it.
The correspondent was at the oars then, and for some reason he too
wished to look at the lighthouse, but his back was toward the far
shore and the waves were important, and for some time he could not
seize an opportunity to turn his head. But at last there came a
wave more gentle than the others, and when at the crest of it he
swiftly scoured the western horizon.</p>

<p>"See it?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"No," said the correspondent slowly, "I didn't see
anything."</p>

<p>"Look again," said the captain. He pointed. "It's exactly in
that direction."</p>

<p>At the top of another wave, the correspondent did as he was bid,
and this time his eyes chanced on a small still thing on the edge
of the swaying horizon. It was precisely like the point of a pin.
It took an anxious eye to find a light house so tiny.</p>

<p>"Think we'll make it, captain?"</p>

<p>"If this wind holds and the boat don't swamp, we can't do much
else," said the captain.</p>

<p>The little boat, lifted by each towering sea, and splashed
viciously by the crests, made progress that in the absence of
seaweed was not apparent to those in her. She seemed just a wee
thing wallowing, miraculously top-up, at the mercy of five oceans.
Occasionally, a great spread of water, like white flames, swarmed
into her.</p>

<p>"Bail her, cook," said the captain serenely.</p>

<p>"All right, captain," said the cheerful cook.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men
that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so.
No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it
warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a
correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously
iron-bound degree than may be common. The hurt captain, lying
against the water-jar in the bow, spoke always in a low voice and
calmly, but he could never command a more ready and swiftly
obedient crew than the motley three of the dingey. It was more than
a mere recognition of what was best for the common safety. There
was surely in it a quality that was personal and heartfelt. And
after this devotion to the commander of the boat there was this
comradeship that the correspondent, for instance, who had been
taught to be cynical of men, knew even at the time was the best
experience of his life. But no one said that it was so. No one
mentioned it.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a sail," remarked the captain. "We might try my
overcoat on the end of an oar and give you two boys a chance to
rest." So the cook and the correspondent held the mast and spread
wide the overcoat. The oiler steered, and the little boat made good
way with her new rig. Sometimes the oiler had to scull sharply to
keep a sea from breaking into the boat, but otherwise sailing was a
success.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lighthouse had been growing slowly larger. It had
now almost assumed color, and appeared like a little grey shadow on
the sky. The man at the oars could not be prevented from turning
his head rather often to try for a glimpse of this little grey
shadow.</p>

<p>At last, from the top of each wave the men in the tossing boat
could see land. Even as the lighthouse was an upright shadow on the
sky, this land seemed but a long black shadow on the sea. It
certainly was thinner than paper. "We must be about opposite New
Smyrna," said the cook, who had coasted this shore often in
schooners. "Captain, by the way, I believe they abandoned that
life-saving station there about a year ago."</p>

<p>"Did they?" said the captain.</p>

<p>The wind slowly died away. The cook and the correspondent were
not now obliged to slave in order to hold high the oar. But the
waves continued their old impetuous swooping at the dingey, and the
little craft, no longer under way, struggled woundily over them.
The oiler or the correspondent took the oars again.</p>

<p>Shipwrecks are <i>à propos</i> of nothing. If men could only
train for them and have them occur when the men had reached pink
condition, there would be less drowning at sea. Of the four in the
dingey none had slept any time worth mentioning for two days and
two nights previous to embarking in the dingey, and in the
excitement of clambering about the deck of a foundering ship they
had also forgotten to eat heartily.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and for others, neither the oiler nor the
correspondent was fond of rowing at this time. The correspondent
wondered ingenuously how in the name of all that was sane could
there be people who thought it amusing to row a boat. It was not an
amusement; it was a diabolical punishment, and even a genius of
mental aberrations could never conclude that it was anything but a
horror to the muscles and a crime against the back. He mentioned to
the boat in general how the amusement of rowing struck him, and the
weary-faced oiler smiled in full sympathy. Previously to the
foundering, by the way, the oiler had worked double-watch in the
engine-room of the ship.</p>

<p>"Take her easy, now, boys," said the captain. "Don't spend
yourselves. If we have to run a surf you'll need all your strength,
because we'll sure have to swim for it. Take your time."</p>

<p>Slowly the land arose from the sea. From a black line it became
a line of black and a line of white, trees and sand. Finally, the
captain said that he could make out a house on the shore. "That's
the house of refuge, sure," said the cook. "They'll see us before
long, and come out after us."</p>

<p>The distant lighthouse reared high. "The keeper ought to be able
to make us out now, if he's looking through a glass," said the
captain. "He'll notify the life-saving people."</p>

<p>"None of those other boats could have got ashore to give word of
the wreck," said the oiler, in a low voice. "Else the lifeboat
would be out hunting us."</p>

<p>Slowly and beautifully the land loomed out of the sea. The wind
came again. It had veered from the north-east to the south-east.
Finally, a new sound struck the ears of the men in the boat. It was
the low thunder of the surf on the shore. "We'll never be able to
make the lighthouse now," said the captain. "Swing her head a
little more north, Billie," said he.</p>

<p>"'A little more north,' sir," said the oiler.</p>

<p>Whereupon the little boat turned her nose once more down the
wind, and all but the oarsman watched the shore grow. Under the
influence of this expansion doubt and direful apprehension was
leaving the minds of the men. The management of the boat was still
most absorbing, but it could not prevent a quiet cheerfulness. In
an hour, perhaps, they would be ashore.</p>

<p>Their backbones had become thoroughly used to balancing in the
boat, and they now rode this wild colt of a dingey like circus men.
The correspondent thought that he had been drenched to the skin,
but happening to feel in the top pocket of his coat, he found
therein eight cigars. Four of them were soaked with sea-water; four
were perfectly scathless. After a search, somebody produced three
dry matches, and thereupon the four waifs rode impudently in their
little boat, and with an assurance of an impending rescue shining
in their eyes, puffed at the big cigars and judged well and ill of
all men. Everybody took a drink of water.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"Cook," remarked the captain, "there don't seem to be any signs
of life about your house of refuge."</p>

<p>"No," replied the cook. "Funny they don't see us!"</p>

<p>A broad stretch of lowly coast lay before the eyes of the men.
It was of dunes topped with dark vegetation. The roar of the surf
was plain, and sometimes they could see the white lip of a wave as
it spun up the beach. A tiny house was blocked out black upon the
sky. Southward, the slim lighthouse lifted its little grey
length.</p>

<p>Tide, wind, and waves were swinging the dingey northward. "Funny
they don't see us," said the men.</p>

<p>The surf's roar was here dulled, but its tone was, nevertheless,
thunderous and mighty. As the boat swam over the great rollers, the
men sat listening to this roar. "We'll swamp sure," said
everybody.</p>

<p>It is fair to say here that there was not a life-saving station
within twenty miles in either direction, but the men did not know
this fact, and in consequence they made dark and opprobrious
remarks concerning the eyesight of the nation's life-savers. Four
scowling men sat in the dingey and surpassed records in the
invention of epithets.</p>

<p>"Funny they don't see us."</p>

<p>The lightheartedness of a former time had completely faded. To
their sharpened minds it was easy to conjure pictures of all kinds
of incompetency and blindness and, indeed, cowardice. There was the
shore of the populous land, and it was bitter and bitter to them
that from it came no sign.</p>

<p>"Well," said the captain, ultimately, "I suppose we'll have to
make a try for ourselves. If we stay out here too long, we'll none
of us have strength left to swim after the boat swamps."</p>

<p>And so the oiler, who was at the oars, turned the boat straight
for the shore. There was a sudden tightening of muscle. There was
some thinking.</p>

<p>"If we don't all get ashore&mdash;" said the captain. "If we
don't all get ashore, I suppose you fellows know where to send news
of my finish?"</p>

<p>They then briefly exchanged some addresses and admonitions. As
for the reflections of the men, there was a great deal of rage in
them. Perchance they might be formulated thus: "If I am going to be
drowned&mdash;if I am going to be drowned&mdash;if I am going to be
drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea,
was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees? Was
I brought here merely to have my nose dragged away as I was about
to nibble the sacred cheese of life? It is preposterous. If this
old ninny-woman, Fate, cannot do better than this, she should be
deprived of the management of men's fortunes. She is an old hen who
knows not her intention. If she has decided to drown me, why did
she not do it in the beginning and save me all this trouble? The
whole affair is absurd...But no, she cannot mean to drown me. She
dare not drown me. She cannot drown me. Not after all this work."
Afterward the man might have had an impulse to shake his fist at
the clouds: "Just you drown me, now, and then hear what I call
you!"</p>

<p>The billows that came at this time were more formidable. They
seemed always just about to break and roll over the little boat in
a turmoil of foam. There was a preparatory and long growl in the
speech of them. No mind unused to the sea would have concluded that
the dingey could ascend these sheer heights in time. The shore was
still afar. The oiler was a wily surfman. "Boys," he said swiftly,
"she won't live three minutes more, and we're too far out to swim.
Shall I take her to sea again, captain?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Go ahead!" said the captain.</p>

<p>This oiler, by a series of quick miracles, and fast and steady
oarsmanship, turned the boat in the middle of the surf and took her
safely to sea again.</p>

<p>There was a considerable silence as the boat bumped over the
furrowed sea to deeper water. Then somebody in gloom spoke. "Well,
anyhow, they must have seen us from the shore by now."</p>

<p>The gulls went in slanting flight up the wind toward the grey
desolate east. A squall, marked by dingy clouds, and clouds
brick-red, like smoke from a burning building, appeared from the
south-east.</p>

<p>"What do you think of those life-saving people? Ain't they
peaches?'</p>

<p>"Funny they haven't seen us."</p>

<p>"Maybe they think we're out here for sport! Maybe they think
we're fishin'. Maybe they think we're damned fools."</p>

<p>It was a long afternoon. A changed tide tried to force them
southward, but the wind and wave said northward. Far ahead, where
coast-line, sea, and sky formed their mighty angle, there were
little dots which seemed to indicate a city on the shore.</p>

<p>"St. Augustine?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "Too near Mosquito Inlet."</p>

<p>And the oiler rowed, and then the correspondent rowed. Then the
oiler rowed. It was a weary business. The human back can become the
seat of more aches and pains than are registered in books for the
composite anatomy of a regiment. It is a limited area, but it can
become the theatre of innumerable muscular conflicts, tangles,
wrenches, knots, and other comforts.</p>

<p>"Did you ever like to row, Billie?" asked the correspondent.</p>

<p>"No," said the oiler. "Hang it!"</p>

<p>When one exchanged the rowing-seat for a place in the bottom of
the boat, he suffered a bodily depression that caused him to be
careless of everything save an obligation to wiggle one finger.
There was cold sea-water swashing to and fro in the boat, and he
lay in it. His head, pillowed on a thwart, was within an inch of
the swirl of a wave crest, and sometimes a particularly
obstreperous sea came in-board and drenched him once more. But
these matters did not annoy him. It is almost certain that if the
boat had capsized he would have tumbled comfortably out upon the
ocean as if he felt sure that it was a great soft mattress.</p>

<p>"Look! There's a man on the shore!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"There! See 'im? See 'im?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sure! He's walking along."</p>

<p>"Now he's stopped. Look! He's facing us!"</p>

<p>"He's waving at us!"</p>

<p>"So he is! By thunder!"</p>

<p>"Ah, now we're all right! Now we're all right! There'll be a
boat out here for us in half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"He's going on. He's running. He's going up to that house
there."</p>

<p>The remote beach seemed lower than the sea, and it required a
searching glance to discern the little black figure. The captain
saw a floating stick and they rowed to it. A bath-towel was by some
weird chance in the boat, and, tying this on the stick, the captain
waved it. The oarsman did not dare turn his head, so he was obliged
to ask questions.</p>

<p>"What's he doing now?"</p>

<p>"He's standing still again. He's looking, I think...There he
goes again. Toward the house...Now he's stopped again."</p>

<p>"Is he waving at us?"</p>

<p>"No, not now! he was, though."</p>

<p>"Look! There comes another man!"</p>

<p>"He's running."</p>

<p>"Look at him go, would you."</p>

<p>"Why, he's on a bicycle. Now he's met the other man. They're
both waving at us. Look!"</p>

<p>"There comes something up the beach."</p>

<p>"What the devil is that thing?"</p>

<p>"Why it looks like a boat."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly it's a boat."</p>

<p>"No, it's on wheels."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is. Well, that must be the life-boat. They drag them
along shore on a wagon."</p>

<p>"That's the life-boat, sure."</p>

<p>"No, by &mdash;&mdash;, it's&mdash;it's an omnibus."</p>

<p>"I tell you it's a life-boat."</p>

<p>"It is not! It's an omnibus. I can see it plain. See? One of
these big hotel omnibuses."</p>

<p>"By thunder, you're right. It's an omnibus, sure as fate. What
do you suppose they are doing with an omnibus? Maybe they are going
around collecting the life-crew, hey?"</p>

<p>"That's it, likely. Look! There's a fellow waving a little black
flag. He's standing on the steps of the omnibus. There come those
other two fellows. Now they're all talking together. Look at the
fellow with the flag. Maybe he ain't waving it."</p>

<p>"That ain't a flag, is it? That's his coat. Why, certainly,
that's his coat."</p>

<p>"So it is. It's his coat. He's taken it off and is waving it
around his head. But would you look at him swing it."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, there isn't any life-saving station there. That's just
a winter resort hotel omnibus that has brought over some of the
boarders to see us drown."</p>

<p>"What's that idiot with the coat mean? What's he signaling,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It looks as if he were trying to tell us to go north. There
must be a life-saving station up there."</p>

<p>"No! He thinks we're fishing. Just giving us a merry hand. See?
Ah, there, Willie!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I could make something out of those signals. What
do you suppose he means?"</p>

<p>"He don't mean anything. He's just playing."</p>

<p>"Well, if he'd just signal us to try the surf again, or to go to
sea and wait, or go north, or go south, or go to hell&mdash;there
would be some reason in it. But look at him. He just stands there
and keeps his coat revolving like a wheel. The ass!"</p>

<p>"There come more people."</p>

<p>"Now there's quite a mob. Look! Isn't that a boat?"</p>

<p>"Where? Oh, I see where you mean. No, that's no boat."</p>

<p>"That fellow is still waving his coat."</p>

<p>"He must think we like to see him do that. Why don't he quit it?
It don't mean anything."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think he is trying to make us go north. It must
be that there's a life-saving station there somewhere."</p>

<p>"Say, he ain't tired yet. Look at 'im wave."</p>

<p>"Wonder how long he can keep that up. He's been revolving his
coat ever since he caught sight of us. He's an idiot. Why aren't
they getting men to bring a boat out? A fishing boat&mdash;one of
those big yawls&mdash;could come out here all right. Why don't he
do something?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, now."</p>

<p>"They'll have a boat out here for us in less than no time, now
that they've seen us."</p>

<p>A faint yellow tone came into the sky over the low land. The
shadows on the sea slowly deepened. The wind bore coldness with it,
and the men began to shiver.</p>

<p>"Holy smoke!" said one, allowing his voice to express his
impious mood, "if we keep on monkeying out here! If we've got to
flounder out here all night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll never have to stay here all night! Don't you worry.
They've seen us now, and it won't be long before they'll come
chasing out after us."</p>

<p>The shore grew dusky. The man waving a coat blended gradually
into this gloom, and it swallowed in the same manner the omnibus
and the group of people. The spray, when it dashed uproariously
over the side, made the voyagers shrink and swear like men who were
being branded.</p>

<p>"I'd like to catch the chump who waved the coat. I feel like
soaking him one, just for luck."</p>

<p>"Why? What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, but then he seemed so damned cheerful."</p>

<p>In the meantime the oiler rowed, and then the correspondent
rowed, and then the oiler rowed. Grey-faced and bowed forward, they
mechanically, turn by turn, plied the leaden oars. The form of the
lighthouse had vanished from the southern horizon, but finally a
pale star appeared, just lifting from the sea. The streaked saffron
in the west passed before the all-merging darkness, and the sea to
the east was black. The land had vanished, and was expressed only
by the low and drear thunder of the surf.</p>

<p>"If I am going to be drowned&mdash;if I am going to be
drowned&mdash;if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the
seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and
contemplate sand and trees? Was I brought here merely to have my
nose dragged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese of
life?"</p>

<p>The patient captain, drooped over the water-jar, was sometimes
obliged to speak to the oarsman.</p>

<p>"Keep her head up! Keep her head up!"</p>

<p>"'Keep her head up,' sir." The voices were weary and low.</p>

<p>This was surely a quiet evening. All save the oarsman lay
heavily and listlessly in the boat's bottom. As for him, his eyes
were just capable of noting the tall black waves that swept forward
in a most sinister silence, save for an occasional subdued growl of
a crest.</p>

<p>The cook's head was on a thwart, and he looked without interest
at the water under his nose. He was deep in other scenes. Finally
he spoke. "Billie," he murmured, dreamfully, "what kind of pie do
you like best?"</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>"Pie," said the oiler and the correspondent, agitatedly. "Don't
talk about those things, blast you!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the cook, "I was just thinking about ham
sandwiches, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A night on the sea in an open boat is a long night. As darkness
settled finally, the shine of the light, lifting from the sea in
the south, changed to full gold. On the northern horizon a new
light appeared, a small bluish gleam on the edge of the waters.
These two lights were the furniture of the world. Otherwise there
was nothing but waves.</p>

<p>Two men huddled in the stern, and distances were so magnificent
in the dingey that the rower was enabled to keep his feet partly
warmed by thrusting them under his companions. Their legs indeed
extended far under the rowing-seat until they touched the feet of
the captain forward. Sometimes, despite the efforts of the tired
oarsman, a wave came piling into the boat, an icy wave of the
night, and the chilling water soaked them anew. They would twist
their bodies for a moment and groan, and sleep the dead sleep once
more, while the water in the boat gurgled about them as the craft
rocked.</p>

<p>The plan of the oiler and the correspondent was for one to row
until he lost the ability, and then arouse the other from his
sea-water couch in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>The oiler plied the oars until his head drooped forward, and the
overpowering sleep blinded him. And he rowed yet afterward. Then he
touched a man in the bottom of the boat, and called his name. "Will
you spell me for a little while?" he said, meekly.</p>

<p>"Sure, Billie," said the correspondent, awakening and dragging
himself to a sitting position. They exchanged places carefully, and
the oiler, cuddling down in the sea-water at the cook's side,
seemed to go to sleep instantly.</p>

<p>The particular violence of the sea had ceased. The waves came
without snarling. The obligation of the man at the oars was to keep
the boat headed so that the tilt of the rollers would not capsize
her, and to preserve her from filling when the crests rushed past.
The black waves were silent and hard to be seen in the darkness.
Often one was almost upon the boat before the oarsman was
aware.</p>

<p>In a low voice the correspondent addressed the captain. He was
not sure that the captain was awake, although this iron man seemed
to be always awake. "Captain, shall I keep her making for that
light north, sir?"</p>

<p>The same steady voice answered him. "Yes. Keep it about two
points off the port bow."</p>

<p>The cook had tied a life-belt around himself in order to get
even the warmth which this clumsy cork contrivance could donate,
and he seemed almost stove-like when a rower, whose teeth
invariably chattered wildly as soon as he ceased his labor, dropped
down to sleep.</p>

<p>The correspondent, as he rowed, looked down at the two men
sleeping under-foot. The cook's arm was around the oiler's
shoulders, and, with their fragmentary clothing and haggard faces,
they were the babes of the sea, a grotesque rendering of the old
babes in the wood.</p>

<p>Later he must have grown stupid at his work, for suddenly there
was a growling of water, and a crest came with a roar and a swash
into the boat, and it was a wonder that it did not set the cook
afloat in his life-belt. The cook continued to sleep, but the oiler
sat up, blinking his eyes and shaking with the new cold.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm awful sorry, Billie," said the correspondent
contritely.</p>

<p>"That's all right, old boy," said the oiler, and lay down again
and was asleep.</p>

<p>Presently it seemed that even the captain dozed, and the
correspondent thought that he was the one man afloat on all the
oceans. The wind had a voice as it came over the waves, and it was
sadder than the end.</p>

<p>There was a long, loud swishing astern of the boat, and a
gleaming trail of phosphorescence, like blue flame, was furrowed on
the black waters. It might have been made by a monstrous knife.</p>

<p>Then there came a stillness, while the correspondent breathed
with the open mouth and looked at the sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was another swish and another long flash of
bluish light, and this time it was alongside the boat, and might
almost have been reached with an oar. The correspondent saw an
enormous fin speed like a shadow through the water, hurling the
crystalline spray and leaving the long glowing trail.</p>

<p>The correspondent looked over his shoulder at the captain. His
face was hidden, and he seemed to be asleep. He looked at the babes
of the sea. They certainly were asleep. So, being bereft of
sympathy, he leaned a little way to one side and swore softly into
the sea.</p>

<p>But the thing did not then leave the vicinity of the boat. Ahead
or astern, on one side or the other, at intervals long or short,
fled the long sparkling streak, and there was to be heard the
whirroo of the dark fin. The speed and power of the thing was
greatly to be admired. It cut the water like a gigantic and keen
projectile.</p>

<p>The presence of this biding thing did not affect the man with
the same horror that it would if he had been a picnicker. He simply
looked at the sea dully and swore in an undertone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is true that he did not wish to be alone. He
wished one of his companions to awaken by chance and keep him
company with it. But the captain hung motionless over the
water-jar, and the oiler and the cook in the bottom of the boat
were plunged in slumber.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"If I am going to be drowned&mdash;if I am going to be
drowned&mdash;if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the
seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and
contemplate sand and trees?"</p>

<p>During this dismal night, it may be remarked that a man would
conclude that it was really the intention of the seven mad gods to
drown him, despite the abominable injustice of it. For it was
certainly an abominable injustice to drown a man who had worked so
hard, so hard. The man felt it would be a crime most unnatural.
Other people had drowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted
sails, but still&mdash;</p>

<p>When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as
important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by
disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple,
and he hates deeply the fact that there are no brick and no
temples. Any visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted
with his jeers.</p>

<p>Then, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels, perhaps,
the desire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas,
bowed to one knee, and with hands supplicant, saying: "Yes, but I
love myself."</p>

<p>A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that
she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his
situation.</p>

<p>The men in the dingey had not discussed these matters, but each
had, no doubt, reflected upon them in silence and according to his
mind. There was seldom any expression upon their faces save the
general one of complete weariness. Speech was devoted to the
business of the boat.</p>

<p>To chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously entered
the correspondent's head. He had even forgotten that he had
forgotten this verse, but it suddenly was in his mind.</p>

<p class="poem">"A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,<br>
There was a lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of<br>
woman's tears;<br>
But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that comrade's
hand,<br>
And he said: 'I shall never see my own, my native land.'"</p>

<p>In his childhood, the correspondent had been made acquainted
with the fact that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,
but he had never regarded the fact as important. Myriads of his
school-fellows had informed him of the soldier's plight, but the
dinning had naturally ended by making him perfectly indifferent. He
had never considered it his affair that a soldier of the Legion lay
dying in Algiers, nor had it appeared to him as a matter for
sorrow. It was less to him than the breaking of a pencil's
point.</p>

<p>Now, however, it quaintly came to him as a human, living thing.
It was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of
a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate;
it was an actuality&mdash;stern, mournful, and fine.</p>

<p>The correspondent plainly saw the soldier. He lay on the sand
with his feet out straight and still. While his pale left hand was
upon his chest in an attempt to thwart the going of his life, the
blood came between his fingers. In the far Algerian distance, a
city of low square forms was set against a sky that was faint with
the last sunset hues. The correspondent, plying the oars and
dreaming of the slow and slower movements of the lips of the
soldier, was moved by a profound and perfectly impersonal
comprehension. He was sorry for the soldier of the Legion who lay
dying in Algiers.</p>

<p>The thing which had followed the boat and waited, had evidently
grown bored at the delay. There was no longer to be heard the slash
of the cut-water, and there was no longer the flame of the long
trail. The light in the north still glimmered, but it was
apparently no nearer to the boat. Sometimes the boom of the surf
rang in the correspondent's ears, and he turned the craft seaward
then and rowed harder. Southward, some one had evidently built a
watch-fire on the beach. It was too low and too far to be seen, but
it made a shimmering, roseate reflection upon the bluff back of it,
and this could be discerned from the boat. The wind came stronger,
and sometimes a wave suddenly raged out like a mountain-cat, and
there was to be seen the sheen and sparkle of a broken crest.</p>

<p>The captain, in the bow, moved on his water-jar and sat erect.
"Pretty long night," he observed to the correspondent. He looked at
the shore. "Those life-saving people take their time."</p>

<p>"Did you see that shark playing around?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him. He was a big fellow, all right."</p>

<p>"Wish I had known you were awake."</p>

<p>Later the correspondent spoke into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>"Billie!" There was a slow and gradual disentanglement. "Billie,
will you spell me?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the oiler.</p>

<p>As soon as the correspondent touched the cold comfortable
sea-water in the bottom of the boat, and had huddled close to the
cook's life-belt he was deep in sleep, despite the fact that his
teeth played all the popular airs. This sleep was so good to him
that it was but a moment before he heard a voice call his name in a
tone that demonstrated the last stages of exhaustion. "Will you
spell me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Billie."</p>

<p>The light in the north had mysteriously vanished, but the
correspondent took his course from the wide-awake captain.</p>

<p>Later in the night they took the boat farther out to sea, and
the captain directed the cook to take one oar at the stern and keep
the boat facing the seas. He was to call out if he should hear the
thunder of the surf. This plan enabled the oiler and the
correspondent to get respite together. "We'll give those boys a
chance to get into shape again," said the captain. They curled down
and, after a few preliminary chatterings and trembles, slept once
more the dead sleep. Neither knew they had bequeathed to the cook
the company of another shark, or perhaps the same shark.</p>

<p>As the boat caroused on the waves, spray occasionally bumped
over the side and gave them a fresh soaking, but this had no power
to break their repose. The ominous slash of the wind and the water
affected them as it would have affected mummies.</p>

<p>"Boys," said the cook, with the notes of every reluctance in his
voice, "she's drifted in pretty close. I guess one of you had
better take her to sea again." The correspondent, aroused, heard
the crash of the toppled crests.</p>

<p>As he was rowing, the captain gave him some whisky-and-water,
and this steadied the chills out of him. "If I ever get ashore and
anybody shows me even a photograph of an oar&mdash;"</p>

<p>At last there was a short conversation.</p>

<p>"Billie...Billie, will you spell me?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the oiler.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>When the correspondent again opened his eyes, the sea and the
sky were each of the grey hue of the dawning. Later, carmine and
gold was painted upon the waters. The morning appeared finally, in
its splendor, with a sky of pure blue, and the sunlight flamed on
the tips of the waves.</p>

<p>On the distant dunes were set many little black cottages, and a
tall white windmill reared above them. No man, nor dog, nor bicycle
appeared on the beach. The cottages might have formed a deserted
village.</p>

<p>The voyagers scanned the shore. A conference was held in the
boat. "Well," said the captain, "if no help is coming we might
better try a run through the surf right away. If we stay out here
much longer we will be too weak to do anything for ourselves at
all." The others silently acquiesced in this reasoning. The boat
was headed for the beach. The correspondent wondered if none ever
ascended the tall wind-tower, and if then they never looked
seaward. This tower was a giant, standing with its back to the
plight of the ants. It represented in a degree, to the
correspondent, the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the
individual&mdash;nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of
men. She did not seem cruel to him then, nor beneficent, nor
treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent.
It is, perhaps, plausible that a man in this situation, impressed
with the unconcern of the universe, should see the innumerable
flaws of his life, and have them taste wickedly in his mind and
wish for another chance. A distinction between right and wrong
seems absurdly clear to him, then, in this new ignorance of the
grave-edge, and he understands that if he were given another
opportunity he would mend his conduct and his words, and be better
and brighter during an introduction or at a tea.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said the captain, "she is going to swamp, sure. All
we can do is to work her in as far as possible, and then when she
swamps, pile out and scramble for the beach. Keep cool now, and
don't jump until she swamps sure."</p>

<p>The oiler took the oars. Over his shoulders he scanned the surf.
"Captain," he said, "I think I'd better bring her about, and keep
her head-on to the seas and back her in."</p>

<p>"All right, Billie," said the captain. "Back her in." The oiler
swung the boat then and, seated in the stern, the cook and the
correspondent were obliged to look over their shoulders to
contemplate the lonely and indifferent shore.</p>

<p>The monstrous in-shore rollers heaved the boat high until the
men were again enabled to see the white sheets of water scudding up
the slanted beach. "We won't get in very close," said the captain.
Each time a man could wrest his attention from the rollers, he
turned his glance toward the shore, and in the expression of the
eyes during this contemplation there was a singular quality. The
correspondent, observing the others, knew that they were not
afraid, but the full meaning of their glances was shrouded.</p>

<p>As for himself, he was too tired to grapple fundamentally with
the fact. He tried to coerce his mind into thinking of it, but the
mind was dominated at this time by the muscles, and the muscles
said they did not care. It merely occurred to him that if he should
drown it would be a shame.</p>

<p>There were no hurried words, no pallor, no plain agitation. The
men simply looked at the shore. "Now, remember to get well clear of
the boat when you jump," said the captain.</p>

<p>Seaward the crest of a roller suddenly fell with a thunderous
crash, and the long white comber came roaring down upon the
boat.</p>

<p>"Steady now," said the captain. The men were silent. They turned
their eyes from the shore to the comber and waited. The boat slid
up the incline, leaped at the furious top, bounced over it, and
swung down the long back of the wave. Some water had been shipped
and the cook bailed it out.</p>

<p>But the next crest crashed also. The tumbling, boiling flood of
white water caught the boat and whirled it almost perpendicular.
Water swarmed in from all sides. The correspondent had his hands on
the gunwale at this time, and when the water entered at that place
he swiftly withdrew his fingers, as if he objected to wetting
them.</p>

<p>The little boat, drunken with this weight of water, reeled and
snuggled deeper into the sea.</p>

<p>"Bail her out, cook! Bail her out," said the captain.</p>

<p>"All right, captain," said the cook.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, the next one will do for us, sure," said the oiler.
"Mind to jump clear of the boat."</p>

<p>The third wave moved forward, huge, furious, implacable. It
fairly swallowed the dingey, and almost simultaneously the men
tumbled into the sea. A piece of lifebelt had lain in the bottom of
the boat, and as the correspondent went overboard he held this to
his chest with his left hand.</p>

<p>The January water was icy, and he reflected immediately that it
was colder than he had expected to find it on the coast of Florida.
This appeared to his dazed mind as a fact important enough to be
noted at the time. The coldness of the water was sad; it was
tragic. This fact was somehow so mixed and confused with his
opinion of his own situation that it seemed almost a proper reason
for tears. The water was cold.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface he was conscious of little but the
noisy water. Afterward he saw his companions in the sea. The oiler
was ahead in the race. He was swimming strongly and rapidly. Off to
the correspondent's left, the cook's great white and corked back
bulged out of the water, and in the rear the captain was hanging
with his one good hand to the keel of the overturned dingey.</p>

<p>There is a certain immovable quality to a shore, and the
correspondent wondered at it amid the confusion of the sea.</p>

<p>It seemed also very attractive, but the correspondent knew that
it was a long journey, and he paddled leisurely. The piece of
life-preserver lay under him, and sometimes he whirled down the
incline of a wave as if he were on a handsled.</p>

<p>But finally he arrived at a place in the sea where travel was
beset with difficulty. He did not pause swimming to inquire what
manner of current had caught him, but there his progress ceased.
The shore was set before him like a bit of scenery on a stage, and
he looked at it and understood with his eyes each detail of it.</p>

<p>As the cook passed, much farther to the left, the captain was
calling to him, "Turn over on your back, cook! Turn over on your
back and use the oar."</p>

<p>"All right, sir." The cook turned on his back, and, paddling
with an oar, went ahead as if he were a canoe.</p>

<p>Presently the boat also passed to the left of the correspondent
with the captain clinging with one hand to the keel. He would have
appeared like a man raising himself to look over a board fence, if
it were not for the extraordinary gymnastics of the boat. The
correspondent marvelled that the captain could still hold to
it.</p>

<p>They passed on, nearer to shore&mdash;the oiler, the cook, the
captain&mdash;and following them went the water-jar, bouncing gaily
over the seas.</p>

<p>The correspondent remained in the grip of this strange new
enemy&mdash;a current. The shore, with its white slope of sand and
its green bluff, topped with little silent cottages, was spread
like a picture before him. It was very near to him then, but he was
impressed as one who in a gallery looks at a scene from Brittany or
Holland.</p>

<p>He thought: "I am going to drown? Can it be possible Can it be
possible? Can it be possible?" Perhaps an individual must consider
his own death to be the final phenomenon of nature.</p>

<p>But later a wave perhaps whirled him out of this small, deadly
current, for he found suddenly that he could again make progress
toward the shore. Later still, he was aware that the captain,
clinging with one hand to the keel of the dingey, had his face
turned away from the shore and toward him, and was calling his
name. "Come to the boat! Come to the boat!"</p>

<p>In his struggle to reach the captain and the boat, he reflected
that when one gets properly wearied, drowning must really be a
comfortable arrangement, a cessation of hostilities accompanied by
a large degree of relief, and he was glad of it, for the main thing
in his mind for some months had been horror of the temporary agony.
He did not wish to be hurt.</p>

<p>Presently he saw a man running along the shore. He was
undressing with most remarkable speed. Coat, trousers, shirt,
everything flew magically off him.</p>

<p>"Come to the boat," called the captain.</p>

<p>"All right, captain." As the correspondent paddled, he saw the
captain let himself down to bottom and leave the boat. Then the
correspondent performed his one little marvel of the voyage. A
large wave caught him and flung him with ease and supreme speed
completely over the boat and far beyond it. It struck him even then
as an event in gymnastics, and a true miracle of the sea. An
over-turned boat in the surf is not a plaything to a swimming
man.</p>

<p>The correspondent arrived in water that reached only to his
waist, but his condition did not enable him to stand for more than
a moment. Each wave knocked him into a heap, and the under-tow
pulled at him.</p>

<p>Then he saw the man who had been running and undressing, and
undressing and running, come bounding into the water. He dragged
ashore the cook, and then waded towards the captain, but the
captain waved him away, and sent him to the correspondent. He was
naked, naked as a tree in winter, but a halo was about his head,
and he shone like a saint. He gave a strong pull, and a long drag,
and a bully heave at the correspondent's hand. The correspondent,
schooled in the minor formulae, said: "Thanks, old man." But
suddenly the man cried: "What's that?" He pointed a swift finger.
The correspondent said: "Go."</p>

<p>In the shallows, face downward, lay the oiler. His forehead
touched sand that was periodically, between each wave, clear of the
sea.</p>

<p>The correspondent did not know all that transpired afterward.
When he achieved safe ground he fell, striking the sand with each
particular part of his body. It was as if he had dropped from a
roof, but the thud was grateful to him.</p>

<p>It seems that instantly the beach was populated with men with
blankets, clothes, and flasks, and women with coffeepots and all
the remedies sacred to their minds. The welcome of the land to the
men from the sea was warm and generous, but a still and dripping
shape was carried slowly up the beach, and the land's welcome for
it could only be the different and sinister hospitality of the
grave.</p>

<p>When it came night, the white waves paced to and fro in the
moonlight, and the wind brought the sound of the great sea's voice
to the men on shore, and they felt that they could then be
interpreters.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>The Reluctant Voyagers</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Two men sat by the sea waves.</p>

<p>"Well, I know I'm not handsome," said one gloomily. He was
poking holes in the sand with a discontented cane.</p>

<p>The companion was watching the waves play. He seemed overcome
with perspiring discomfort as a man who is resolved to set another
man right.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mouth turned into a straight line.</p>

<p>"To be sure you are not," he cried vehemently.</p>

<p>"You look like thunder. I do not desire to be unpleasant, but I
must assure you that your freckled skin continually reminds
spectators of white wall paper with gilt roses on it. The top of
your head looks like a little wooden plate. And your
figure&mdash;heavens!"</p>

<p>For a time they were silent. They stared at the waves that
purred near their feet like sleepy sea-kittens.</p>

<p>Finally the first man spoke.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, defiantly, "what of it?"</p>

<p>"What of it?" exploded the other. "Why, it means that you'd look
like blazes in a bathing-suit."</p>

<p>They were again silent. The freckled man seemed ashamed. His
tall companion glowered at the scenery.</p>

<p>"I am decided," said the freckled man suddenly. He got boldly up
from the sand and strode away. The tall man followed, walking
sarcastically and glaring down at the round, resolute figure before
him.</p>

<p>A bath-clerk was looking at the world with superior eyes through
a hole in a board. To him the freckled man made application, waving
his hands over his person in illustration of a snug fit. The
bath-clerk thought profoundly. Eventually, he handed out a blue
bundle with an air of having phenomenally solved the freckled man's
dimensions.</p>

<p>The latter resumed his resolute stride.</p>

<p>"See here," said the tall man, following him, "I bet you've got
a regular toga, you know. That fellow couldn't tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he could," interrupted the freckled man, "I saw correct
mathematics in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, supposin' he has missed your size. Supposin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tom," again interrupted the other, "produce your proud clothes
and we'll go in."</p>

<p>The tall man swore bitterly. He went to one of a row of little
wooden boxes and shut himself in it. His companion repaired to a
similar box.</p>

<p>At first he felt like an opulent monk in a too-small cell, and
he turned round two or three times to see if he could. He arrived
finally into his bathing-dress. Immediately he dropped gasping upon
a three-cornered bench. The suit fell in folds about his reclining
form. There was silence, save for the caressing calls of the waves
without.</p>

<p>Then he heard two shoes drop on the floor in one of the little
coops. He began to clamor at the boards like a penitent at an
unforgiving door.</p>

<p>"Tom," called he, "Tom&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice of wrath, muffled by cloth, came through the walls. "You
go t' blazes!"</p>

<p>The freckled man began to groan, taking the occupants of the
entire row of coops into his confidence.</p>

<p>"Stop your noise," angrily cried the tall man from his hidden
den. "You rented the bathing-suit, didn't you? Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It ain't a bathing-suit," shouted the freckled man at the
boards. "It's an auditorium, a ballroom, or something. It isn't a
bathing-suit."</p>

<p>The tall man came out of his box. His suit looked like blue
skin. He walked with grandeur down the alley between the rows of
coops. Stopping in front of his friend's door, he rapped on it with
passionate knuckles.</p>

<p>"Come out of there, y' ol' fool," said he, in an enraged
whisper. "It's only your accursed vanity. Wear it anyhow. What
difference does it make? I never saw such a vain ol' idiot!"</p>

<p>As he was storming the door opened, and his friend confronted
him. The tall man's legs gave way, and he fell against the opposite
door.</p>

<p>The freckled man regarded him sternly.</p>

<p>"You're an ass," he said.</p>

<p>His back curved in scorn. He walked majestically down the alley.
There was pride in the way his chubby feet patted the boards. The
tall man followed, weakly, his eyes riveted upon the figure
ahead.</p>

<p>As a disguise the freckled man had adopted the stomach of
importance. He moved with an air of some sort of procession, across
a board walk, down some steps, and out upon the sand.</p>

<p>There was a pug dog and three old women on a bench, a man and a
maid with a book and a parasol, a seagull drifting high in the
wind, and a distant, tremendous meeting of sea and sky. Down on the
wet sand stood a girl being wooed by the breakers.</p>

<p>The freckled man moved with stately tread along the beach. The
tall man, numb with amazement, came in the rear. They neared the
girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall man was seized with convulsions. He laughed,
and the girl turned her head.</p>

<p>She perceived the freckled man in the bathing-suit. An
expression of wonderment overspread her charming face. It changed
in a moment to a pearly smile.</p>

<p>This smile seemed to smite the freckled man. He obviously tried
to swell and fit his suit. Then he turned a shrivelling glance upon
his companion, and fled up the beach. The tall man ran after him,
pursuing with mocking cries that tingled his flesh like stings of
insects. He seemed to be trying to lead the way out of the world.
But at last he stopped and faced about.</p>

<p>"Tom Sharp," said he, between his clenched teeth, "you are an
unutterable wretch! I could grind your bones under my heel."</p>

<p>The tall man was in a trance, with glazed eyes fixed on the
bathing-dress. He seemed to be murmuring: "Oh, good Lord! Oh, good
Lord! I never saw such a suit!"</p>

<p>The freckled man made the gesture of an assassin.</p>

<p>"Tom Sharp, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other was still murmuring: "Oh, good Lord! I never saw such
a suit! I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>The freckled man ran down into the sea.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>The cool, swirling waters took his temper from him, and it
became a thing that is lost in the ocean. The tall man floundered
in, and the two forgot and rollicked in the waves.</p>

<p>The freckled man, in endeavoring to escape from mankind, had
left all save a solitary fisherman under a large hat, and three
boys in bathing-dress, laughing and splashing upon a raft made of
old spars.</p>

<p>The two men swam softly over the ground swells.</p>

<p>The three boys dived from their raft, and turned their jolly
faces shorewards. It twisted slowly around and around, and began to
move seaward on some unknown voyage. The freckled man laid his face
to the water and swam toward the raft with a practised stroke. The
tall man followed, his bended arm appearing and disappearing with
the precision of machinery.</p>

<p>The craft crept away, slowly and wearily, as if luring. The
little wooden plate on the freckled man's head looked at the shore
like a round, brown eye, but his gaze was fixed on the raft that
slyly appeared to be waiting. The tall man used the little wooden
plate as a beacon.</p>

<p>At length the freckled man reached the raft and climbed aboard.
He lay down on his back and puffed. His bathing-dress spread about
him like a dead balloon. The tall man came, snorted, shook his
tangled locks and lay down by the side of his companion.</p>

<p>They were overcome with a delicious drowsiness. The planks of
the raft seemed to fit their tired limbs. They gazed dreamily up
into the vast sky of summer.</p>

<p>"This is great," said the tall man. His companion grunted
blissfully.</p>

<p>Gentle hands from the sea rocked their craft and lulled them to
peace. Lapping waves sang little rippling sea-songs about them. The
two men issued contented groans.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"What?" said the other.</p>

<p>"This is great."</p>

<p>They lay and thought.</p>

<p>A fish-hawk, soaring, suddenly, turned and darted at the waves.
The tall man indolently twisted his head and watched the bird
plunge its claws into the water. It heavily arose with a silver
gleaming fish.</p>

<p>"That bird has got his feet wet again. It's a shame," murmured
the tall man sleepily. "He must suffer from an endless cold in the
head. He should wear rubber boots. They'd look great, too. If I was
him, I'd&mdash;Great Scott!"</p>

<p>He had partly arisen, and was looking at the shore.</p>

<p>He began to scream. "Ted! Ted! Ted! Look!"</p>

<p>"What's matter?" dreamily spoke the freckled man. "You remind me
of when I put the bird-shot in your leg." He giggled softly.</p>

<p>The agitated tall man made a gesture of supreme eloquence. His
companion up-reared and turned a startled gaze shoreward.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he roared, as if stabbed.</p>

<p>The land was a long, brown streak with a rim of green, in which
sparkled the tin roofs of huge hotels. The hands from the sea had
pushed them away. The two men sprang erect, and did a little dance
of perturbation.</p>

<p>"What shall we do? What shall we do?" moaned the freckled man,
wriggling fantastically in his dead balloon.</p>

<p>The changing shore seemed to fascinate the tall man, and for a
time he did not speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly he concluded his minuet of horror. He wheeled about and
faced the freckled man. He elaborately folded his arms.</p>

<p>"So," he said, in slow, formidable tones. "So! This all comes
from your accursed vanity, your bathing-suit, your idiocy; you have
murdered your best friend."</p>

<p>He turned away. His companion reeled as if stricken by an
unexpected arm.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands. "Tom, Tom," wailed he, beseechingly,
"don't be such a fool."</p>

<p>The broad back of his friend was occupied by a contemptuous
sneer.</p>

<p>Three ships fell off the horizon. Landward, the hues were
blending. The whistle of a locomotive sounded from an infinite
distance as if tooting in heaven.</p>

<p>"Tom! Tom! My dear boy," quavered the freckled man, "don't speak
that way to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not," said the other, still facing away and
throwing the words over his shoulder. "You suppose I am going to
accept all this calmly, don't you? Not make the slightest
objection? Make no protest at all, hey?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" began the freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man's wrath suddenly exploded. "You've abducted me!
That's the whole amount of it! You've abducted me!"</p>

<p>"I ain't," protested the freckled man. "You must think I'm a
fool."</p>

<p>The tall man swore, and sitting down, dangled his legs angrily
in the water. Natural law compelled his companion to occupy the
other end of the raft.</p>

<p>Over the waters little shoals of fish spluttered, raising tiny
tempests. Languid jelly-fish floated near, tremulously waving a
thousand legs. A row of porpoises trundled along like a procession
of cog-wheels. The sky became greyed save where over the land
sunset colors were assembling.</p>

<p>The two voyagers, back to back and at either end of the raft,
quarrelled at length.</p>

<p>"What did you want to follow me for?" demanded the freckled man
in a voice of indignation.</p>

<p>"If your figure hadn't been so like a bottle, we wouldn't be
here," replied the tall man.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>The fires in the west blazed away, and solemnity spread over the
sea. Electric lights began to blink like eyes. Night menaced the
voyagers with a dangerous darkness, and fear came to bind their
souls together. They huddled fraternally in the middle of the
raft.</p>

<p>"I feel like a molecule," said the freckled man in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>"I'd give two dollars for a cigar," muttered the tall man.</p>

<p>A V-shaped flock of ducks flew towards Barnegat, between the
voyagers and a remnant of yellow sky. Shadows and winds came from
the vanished eastern horizon.</p>

<p>"I think I hear voices," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"That Dollie Ramsdell was an awfully nice girl," said the tall
man.</p>

<p>When the coldness of the sea night came to them, the freckled
man found he could by a peculiar movement of his legs and arms
encase himself in his bathing-dress. The tall man was compelled to
whistle and shiver. As night settled finally over the sea, red and
green lights began to dot the blackness. There were mysterious
shadows between the waves.</p>

<p>"I see things comin'," murmured the freckled man.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't ordered that new dress-suit for the hop
to-morrow night," said the tall man reflectively.</p>

<p>The sea became uneasy and heaved painfully, like a lost bosom,
when little forgotten heart-bells try to chime with a pure sound.
The voyagers cringed at magnified foam on distant wave crests. A
moon came and looked at them.</p>

<p>"Somebody's here," whispered the freckled man.</p>

<p>"I wish I had an almanac," remarked the tall man, regarding the
moon.</p>

<p>Presently they fell to staring at the red and green lights that
twinkled about them.</p>

<p>"Providence will not leave us," asserted the freckled man.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll be picked up shortly. I owe money," said the tall
man.</p>

<p>He began to thrum on an imaginary banjo.</p>

<p>"I have heard," said he, suddenly, "that captains with healthy
ships beneath their feet will never turn back after having once
started on a voyage. In that case we will be rescued by some ship
bound for the golden seas of the south. Then, you'll be up to some
of your confounded devilment and we'll get put off. They'll maroon
us! That's what they'll do! They'll maroon us! On an island with
palm trees and sun-kissed maidens and all that. Sun-kissed maidens,
eh? Great! They'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>He suddenly ceased and turned to stone. At a distance a great,
green eye was contemplating the sea wanderers.</p>

<p>They stood up and did another dance. As they watched the eye
grew larger.</p>

<p>Directly the form of a phantom-like ship came into view. About
the great, green eye there bobbed small yellow dots. The wanderers
could hear a far-away creaking of unseen tackle and flapping of
shadowy sails. There came the melody of the waters as the ship's
prow thrust its way.</p>

<p>The tall man delivered an oration.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "here come our rescuers. The brave fellows!
How I long to take the manly captain by the hand! You will soon see
a white boat with a star on its bow drop from the side of yon ship.
Kind sailors in blue and white will help us into the boat and
conduct our wasted frames to the quarter-deck, where the handsome,
bearded captain, with gold bands all around, will welcome us. Then
in the hard-oak cabin, while the wine gurgles and the Havanas glow,
we'll tell our tale of peril and privation."</p>

<p>The ship came on like a black hurrying animal with froth-filled
maw. The two wanderers stood up and clasped hands. Then they howled
out a wild duet that rang over the wastes of sea.</p>

<p>The cries seemed to strike the ship.</p>

<p>Men with boots on yelled and ran about the deck. They picked up
heavy articles and threw them down. They yelled more. After hideous
creakings and flappings, the vessel stood still.</p>

<p>In the meantime the wanderers had been chanting their song for
help. Out in the blackness they beckoned to the ship and
coaxed.</p>

<p>A voice came to them.</p>

<p>"Hello," it said.</p>

<p>They puffed out their cheeks and began to shout. "Hello! Hello!
Hello!"</p>

<p>"Wot do yeh want?" said the voice.</p>

<p>The two wanderers gazed at each other, and sat suddenly down on
the raft. Some pall came sweeping over the sky and quenched their
stars.</p>

<p>But almost the tall man got up and brawled miscellaneous
information. He stamped his foot, and frowning into the night,
swore threateningly.</p>

<p>The vessel seemed fearful of these moaning voices that called
from a hidden cavern of the water. And now one voice was filled
with a menace. A number of men with enormous limbs that threw vast
shadows over the sea as the lanterns flickered, held a debate and
made gestures.</p>

<p>Off in the darkness, the tall man began to clamor like a mob.
The freckled man sat in astounded silence, with his legs weak.</p>

<p>After a time one of the men of enormous limbs seized a rope that
was tugging at the stem and drew a small boat from the shadows.
Three giants clambered in and rowed cautiously toward the raft.
Silver water flashed in the gloom as the oars dipped.</p>

<p>About fifty feet from the raft the boat stopped. "Who er you?"
asked a voice.</p>

<p>The tall man braced himself and explained. He drew vivid
pictures, his twirling fingers illustrating like live brushes.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the three giants.</p>

<p>The voyagers deserted the raft. They looked back, feeling in
their hearts a mite of tenderness for the wet planks. Later, they
wriggled up the side of the vessel and climbed over the
railing.</p>

<p>On deck they met a man.</p>

<p>He held a lantern to their faces. "Got any chewin' tewbacca?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said the tall man, "we ain't."</p>

<p>The man had a bronze face and solitary whiskers. Peculiar lines
about his mouth were shaped into an eternal smile of derision. His
feet were bare, and clung handily to crevices.</p>

<p>Fearful trousers were supported by a piece of suspender that
went up the wrong side of his chest and came down the right side of
his back, dividing him into triangles.</p>

<p>"Ezekiel P. Sanford, capt'in, schooner 'Mary Jones,' of N'yack,
N. Y., genelmen," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the tall man, "delighted, I'm sure."</p>

<p>There were a few moments of silence. The giants were hovering in
the gloom and staring.</p>

<p>Suddenly astonishment exploded the captain.</p>

<p>"Wot th' devil&mdash;&mdash;" he shouted. "Wot th' devil yeh got
on?"</p>

<p>"Bathing-suits," said the tall man.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>The schooner went on. The two voyagers sat down and watched.
After a time they began to shiver. The soft blackness of the summer
night passed away, and grey mists writhed over the sea. Soon lights
of early dawn went changing across the sky, and the twin beacons on
the highlands grew dim and sparkling faintly, as if a monster were
dying. The dawn penetrated the marrow of the two men in
bathing-dress.</p>

<p>The captain used to pause opposite them, hitch one hand in his
suspender, and laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I be dog-hanged," he frequently said.</p>

<p>The tall man grew furious. He snarled in a mad undertone to his
companion. "This rescue ain't right. If I had known&mdash;"</p>

<p>He suddenly paused, transfixed by the captain's suspender. "It's
goin' to break," cried he, in an ecstatic whisper. His eyes grew
large with excitement as he watched the captain laugh. "It'll break
in a minute, sure."</p>

<p>But the commander of the schooner recovered, and invited them to
drink and eat. They followed him along the deck, and fell down a
square black hole into the cabin.</p>

<p>It was a little den, with walls of a vanished whiteness. A lamp
shed an orange light. In a sort of recess two little beds were
hiding. A wooden table, immovable, as if the craft had been builded
around it, sat in the middle of the floor. Overhead the square hole
was studded with a dozen stars. A foot-worn ladder led to the
heavens.</p>

<p>The captain produced ponderous crackers and some cold broiled
ham. Then he vanished in the firmament like a fantastic comet.</p>

<p>The freckled man sat quite contentedly like a stout squaw in a
blanket. The tall man walked about the cabin and sniffed. He was
angered at the crudeness of the rescue, and his shrinking clothes
made him feel too large. He contemplated his unhappy state.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he broke out. "I won't stand this, I tell you! Heavens
and earth, look at the&mdash;say, what in the blazes did you want
to get me in this thing for, anyhow? You're a fine old duffer, you
are! Look at that ham!"</p>

<p>The freckled man grunted. He seemed somewhat blissful. He was
seated upon a bench, comfortably enwrapped in his
bathing-dress.</p>

<p>The tall man stormed about the cabin.</p>

<p>"This is an outrage! I'll see the captain! I'll tell him what I
think of&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a pair of legs that appeared among the
stars. The captain came down the ladder. He brought a coffee pot
from the sky.</p>

<p>The tall man bristled forward. He was going to denounce
everything.</p>

<p>The captain was intent upon the coffee pot, balancing it
carefully, and leaving his unguided feet to find the steps of the
ladder.</p>

<p>But the wrath of the tall man faded. He twirled his fingers in
excitement, and renewed his ecstatic whisperings to the freckled
man.</p>

<p>"It's going to break! Look, quick, look! It'll break in a
minute!"</p>

<p>He was transfixed with interest, forgetting his wrongs in
staring at the perilous passage.</p>

<p>But the captain arrived on the floor with triumphant
suspenders.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "after yeh have eat, maybe ye'd like t'sleep
some! If so, yeh can sleep on them beds."</p>

<p>The tall man made no reply, save in a strained undertone. "It'll
break in about a minute! Look, Ted, look quick!"</p>

<p>The freckled man glanced in a little bed on which were heaped
boots and oilskins. He made a courteous gesture.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, we could not think of depriving you of your beds.
No, indeed. Just a couple of blankets if you have them, and we'll
sleep very comfortable on these benches."</p>

<p>The captain protested, politely twisting his back and bobbing
his head. The suspenders tugged and creaked. The tall man partially
suppressed a cry, and took a step forward.</p>

<p>The freckled man was sleepily insistent, and shortly the captain
gave over his deprecatory contortions. He fetched a pink quilt with
yellow dots on it to the freckled man, and a black one with red
roses on it to the tall man.</p>

<p>Again he vanished in the firmament. The tall man gazed until the
last remnant of trousers disappeared from the sky. Then he wrapped
himself up in his quilt and lay down. The freckled man was puffing
contentedly, swathed like an infant. The yellow polka-dots rose and
fell on the vast pink of his chest.</p>

<p>The wanderers slept. In the quiet could be heard the groanings
of timbers as the sea seemed to crunch them together. The lapping
of water along the vessel's side sounded like gaspings. A hundred
spirits of the wind had got their wings entangled in the rigging,
and, in soft voices, were pleading to be loosened.</p>

<p>The freckled man was awakened by a foreign noise. He opened his
eyes and saw his companion standing by his couch.</p>

<p>His comrade's face was wan with suffering. His eyes glowed in
the darkness. He raised his arms, spreading them out like a
clergyman at a grave. He groaned deep in his chest.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" yelled the freckled man, starting up. "Tom, Tom,
what's th' matter?"</p>

<p>The tall man spoke in a fearful voice. "To New York," he said,
"to New York in our bathing-suits."</p>

<p>The freckled man sank back. The shadows of the cabin threw
mysteries about the figure of the tall man, arrayed like some
ancient and potent astrologer in the black quilt with the red roses
on it.</p>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Directly the tall man went and lay down and began to groan.</p>

<p>The freckled man felt the miseries of the world upon him. He
grew angry at the tall man awakening him. They quarrelled.</p>

<p>"Well," said the tall man, finally, "we're in a fix."</p>

<p>"I know that," said the other, sharply.</p>

<p>They regarded the ceiling in silence.</p>

<p>"What in the thunder are we going to do?" demanded the tall man,
after a time. His companion was still silent. "Say," repeated he,
angrily, "what in the thunder are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said the freckled man in a dismal
voice.</p>

<p>"Well, think of something," roared the other. "Think of
something, you old fool. You don't want to make any more idiots of
yourself, do you?"</p>

<p>"I ain't made an idiot of myself."</p>

<p>"Well, think. Know anybody in the city?"</p>

<p>"I know a fellow up in Harlem," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"You know a fellow up in Harlem," howled the tall man. "Up in
Harlem! How the dickens are we to&mdash;say, you're crazy!"</p>

<p>"We can take a cab," cried the other, waxing indignant.</p>

<p>The tall man grew suddenly calm. "Do you know any one else?" he
asked, measuredly.</p>

<p>"I know another fellow somewhere on Park Place."</p>

<p>"Somewhere on Park Place," repeated the tall man in an unnatural
manner. "Somewhere on Park Place." With an air of sublime
resignation he turned his face to the wall.</p>

<p>The freckled man sat erect and frowned in the direction of his
companion. "Well, now, I suppose you are going to sulk. You make me
ill! It's the best we can do, ain't it? Hire a cab and go look that
fellow up on Park&mdash;What's that? You can't afford it? What
nonsense! You are getting&mdash;Oh! Well, maybe we can beg some
clothes of the captain. Eh? Did I see 'im? Certainly, I saw 'im.
Yes, it is improbable that a man who wears trousers like that can
have clothes to lend. No, I won't wear oilskins and a sou'-wester.
To Athens? Of course not! I don't know where it is. Do you? I
thought not. With all your grumbling about other people, you never
know anything important yourself. What? Broadway? I'll be hanged
first. We can get off at Harlem, man alive. There are no cabs in
Harlem. I don't think we can bribe a sailor to take us ashore and
bring a cab to the dock, for the very simple reason that we have
nothing to bribe him with. What? No, of course not. See here, Tom
Sharp, don't you swear at me like that. I won't have it. What's
that? I ain't, either. I ain't. What? I am not. It's no such thing.
I ain't. I've got more than you have, anyway. Well, you ain't doing
anything so very brilliant yourself&mdash;just lying there and
cussin'." At length the tall man feigned prodigiously to snore. The
freckled man thought with such vigor that he fell asleep.</p>

<p>After a time he dreamed that he was in a forest where bass drums
grew on trees. There came a strong wind that banged the fruit about
like empty pods. A frightful din was in his ears.</p>

<p>He awoke to find the captain of the schooner standing over
him.</p>

<p>"We're at New York now," said the captain, raising his voice
above the thumping and banging that was being done on deck, "an' I
s'pose you fellers wanta go ashore." He chuckled in an exasperating
manner. "Jes' sing out when yeh wanta go," he added, leering at the
freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man awoke, came over and grasped the captain by the
throat.</p>

<p>"If you laugh again I'll kill you," he said.</p>

<p>The captain gurgled and waved his legs and arms.</p>

<p>"In the first place," the tall man continued, "you rescued us in
a deucedly shabby manner. It makes me ill to think of it. I've a
mind to mop you 'round just for that. In the second place, your
vessel is bound for Athens, N. Y., and there's no sense in it. Now,
will you or will you not turn this ship about and take us back
where our clothes are, or to Philadelphia, where we belong?"</p>

<p>He furiously shook the captain. Then he eased his grip and
awaited a reply.</p>

<p>"I can't," yelled the captain, "I can't. This vessel don't
belong to me. I've got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then," interrupted the tall man, "can you lend us some
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Hain't got none," replied the captain, promptly. His face was
red, and his eyes were glaring.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the tall man, "can you lend us some
money?"</p>

<p>"Hain't got none," replied the captain, promptly. Something
overcame him and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Thunderation," roared the tall man. He seized the captain, who
began to have wriggling contortions. The tall man kneaded him as if
he were biscuits. "You infernal scoundrel," he bellowed, "this
whole affair is some wretched plot, and you are in it. I am about
to kill you."</p>

<p>The solitary whisker of the captain did acrobatic feats like a
strange demon upon his chin. His eyes stood perilously from his
head. The suspender wheezed and tugged like the tackle of a
sail.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall man released his hold. Great expectancy sat
upon his features. "It's going to break!" he cried, rubbing his
hands.</p>

<p>But the captain howled and vanished in the sky.</p>

<p>The freckled man then came forward. He appeared filled with
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"So!" said he. "So, you've settled the matter. The captain is
the only man in the world who can help us, and I daresay he'll do
anything he can now."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the tall man. "If you don't like the
way I run things you shouldn't have come on this trip at all."</p>

<p>They had another quarrel.</p>

<p>At the end of it they went on deck. The captain stood at the
stern addressing the bow with opprobrious language. When he
perceived the voyagers he began to fling his fists about in the
air.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to put yeh off!" he yelled. The wanderers stared at
each other.</p>

<p>"Hum," said the tall man.</p>

<p>The freckled man looked at his companion. "He's going to put us
off, you see," he said, complacently.</p>

<p>The tall man began to walk about and move his shoulders. "I'd
like to see you do it," he said, defiantly.</p>

<p>The captain tugged at a rope. A boat came at his bidding.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you do it," the tall man repeated, continually.
An imperturbable man in rubber boots climbed down in the boat and
seized the oars. The captain motioned downward. His whisker had a
triumphant appearance.</p>

<p>The two wanderers looked at the boat. "I guess we'll have to get
in," murmured the freckled man.</p>

<p>The tall man was standing like a granite column. "I won't," said
he. "I won't! I don't care what you do, but I won't!"</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;" expostulated the other. They held a furious
debate.</p>

<p>In the meantime the captain was darting about making sinister
gestures, but the back of the tall man held him at bay. The crew,
much depleted by the departure of the imperturbable man into the
boat, looked on from the bow.</p>

<p>"You're a fool," the freckled man concluded his argument.</p>

<p>"So?" inquired the tall man, highly exasperated.</p>

<p>"So! Well, if you think you're so bright, we'll go in the boat,
and then you'll see."</p>

<p>He climbed down into the craft and seated himself in an ominous
manner at the stern.</p>

<p>"You'll see," he said to his companion, as the latter floundered
heavily down. "You'll see!"</p>

<p>The man in rubber boots calmly rowed the boat toward the shore.
As they went, the captain leaned over the railing and laughed. The
freckled man was seated very victoriously.</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't this the right thing after all?" he inquired in a
pleasant voice. The tall man made no reply.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>As they neared the dock something seemed suddenly to occur to
the freckled man.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he murmured. He stared at the approaching
shore.</p>

<p>"My, what a plight, Tommy!" he quavered.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" spoke up the tall man. "Why, I really thought
you liked it." He laughed in a hard voice. "Lord, what a figure
you'll cut."</p>

<p>This laugh jarred the freckled man's soul. He became mad.</p>

<p>"Thunderation, turn the boat around!" he roared. "Turn 'er
round, quick! Man alive, we can't&mdash;turn 'er round, d'ye
hear!"</p>

<p>The tall man in the stern gazed at his companion with glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he said. "We're going on. You insisted Upon
it." He began to prod his companion with words.</p>

<p>The freckled man stood up and waved his arms.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the tall man. "You'll tip the boat over."</p>

<p>The other man began to shout.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said the tall man again.</p>

<p>Words bubbled from the freckled man's mouth. There was a little
torrent of sentences that almost choked him. And he protested
passionately with his hands.</p>

<p>But the boat went on to the shadow of the docks. The tall man
was intent upon balancing it as it rocked dangerously during his
comrade's oration.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he continually repeated.</p>

<p>"I won't," raged the freckled man. "I won't do anything." The
boat wobbled with these words.</p>

<p>"Say," he continued, addressing the oarsman, "just turn this
boat round, will you? Where in the thunder are you taking us to,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>The oarsman looked at the sky and thought. Finally he spoke.
"I'm doin' what the cap'n sed."</p>

<p>"Well, what in th' blazes do I care what the cap'n sed?"
demanded the freckled man. He took a violent step. "You just turn
this round or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The small craft reeled. Over one side water came flashing in.
The freckled man cried out in fear, and gave a jump to the other
side. The tall man roared orders, and the oarsman made efforts. The
boat acted for a moment like an animal on a slackened wire. Then it
upset.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said the tall man, in a final roar as he was plunged
into the water. The oarsman dropped his oars to grapple with the
gunwale. He went down saying unknown words. The freckled man's
explanation or apology was strangled by the water.</p>

<p>Two or three tugs let off whistles of astonishment, and
continued on their paths. A man dozing on a dock aroused and began
to caper.</p>

<p>The passengers on a ferry-boat all ran to the near railing. A
miraculous person in a small boat was bobbing on the waves near the
piers. He sculled hastily toward the scene. It was a swirl of
waters in the midst of which the dark bottom of the boat appeared,
whale-like.</p>

<p>Two heads suddenly came up.</p>

<p>"839," said the freckled man, chokingly. "That's it! 839!"</p>

<p>"What is?" said the tall man.</p>

<p>"That's the number of that feller on Park Place. I just
remembered."</p>

<p>"You're the bloomingest&mdash;" the tall man said.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault," interrupted his companion. "If you
hadn't&mdash;" He tried to gesticulate, but one hand held to the
keel of the boat, and the other was supporting the form of the
oarsman. The latter had fought a battle with his immense rubber
boots and had been conquered.</p>

<p>The rescuer in the other small boat came fiercely. As his craft
glided up, he reached out and grasped the tall man by the collar
and dragged him into the boat, interrupting what was, under the
circumstances, a very brilliant flow of rhetoric directed at the
freckled man. The oarsman of the wrecked craft was taken tenderly
over the gunwale and laid in the bottom of the boat. Puffing and
blowing, the freckled man climbed in.</p>

<p>"You'll upset this one before we can get ashore," the other
voyager remarked.</p>

<p>As they turned toward the land they saw that the nearest dock
was lined with people. The freckled man gave a little moan.</p>

<p>But the staring eyes of the crowd were fixed on the limp form of
the man in rubber boots. A hundred hands reached down to help lift
the body up. On the dock some men grabbed it and began to beat it
and roll it. A policeman tossed the spectators about. Each
individual in the heaving crowd sought to fasten his eyes on the
blue-tinted face of the man in the rubber boots. They surged to and
fro, while the policeman beat them indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The wanderers came modestly up the dock and gazed shrinkingly at
the throng. They stood for a moment, holding their breath to see
the first finger of amazement levelled at them.</p>

<p>But the crowd bended and surged in absorbing anxiety to view the
man in rubber boots, whose face fascinated them. The sea-wanderers
were as though they were not there.</p>

<p>They stood without the jam and whispered hurriedly.</p>

<p>"839," said the freckled man.</p>

<p>"All right," said the tall man.</p>

<p>Under the pommeling hands the oarsman showed signs of life. The
voyagers watched him make a protesting kick at the leg of the
crowd, the while uttering angry groans.</p>

<p>"He's better," said the tall man, softly; "let's make off."</p>

<p>Together they stole noiselessly up the dock. Directly in front
of it they found a row of six cabs.</p>

<p>The drivers on top were filled with a mighty curiosity. They had
driven hurriedly from the adjacent ferry-house when they had seen
the first running sign of an accident. They were straining on their
toes and gazing at the tossing backs of the men in the crowd.</p>

<p>The wanderers made a little detour, and then went rapidly
towards a cab. They stopped in front of it and looked up.</p>

<p>"Driver," called the tall man, softly.</p>

<p>The man was intent.</p>

<p>"Driver," breathed the freckled man. They stood for a moment and
gazed imploringly.</p>

<p>The cabman suddenly moved his feet. "By Jimmy, I bet he's a
gonner," he said, in an ecstacy, and he again relapsed into a
statue.</p>

<p>The freckled man groaned and wrung his hands. The tall man
climbed into the cab.</p>

<p>"Come in here," he said to his companion. The freckled man
climbed in, and the tall man reached over and pulled the door shut.
Then he put his head out the window.</p>

<p>"Driver," he roared, sternly, "839 Park Place&mdash;and
quick."</p>

<p>The driver looked down and met the eye of the tall man.
"Eh?&mdash;Oh&mdash;839? Park Place? Yessir." He reluctantly gave
his horse a clump on the back. As the conveyance rattled off the
wanderers huddled back among the dingy cushions and heaved great
breaths of relief.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all over," said the freckled man, finally. "We're
about out of it. And quicker than I expected. Much quicker. It
looked to me sometimes that we were doomed. I am thankful to find
it not so. I am rejoiced. And I hope and trust that you&mdash;well,
I don't wish to&mdash;perhaps it is not the proper time
to&mdash;that is, I don't wish to intrude a moral at an inopportune
moment, but, my dear, dear fellow, I think the time is ripe to
point out to you that your obstinacy, your selfishness, your
villainous temper, and your various other faults can make it just
as unpleasant for your ownself, my dear boy, as they frequently do
for other people. You can see what you brought us to, and I most
sincerely hope, my dear, dear fellow, that I shall soon see those
signs in you which shall lead me to believe that you have become a
wiser man."</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>The End of the Battle</h2>

<p>A sergeant, a corporal, and fourteen men of the Twelfth Regiment
of the Line had been sent out to occupy a house on the main
highway. They would be at least a half of a mile in advance of any
other picket of their own people. Sergeant Morton was deeply angry
at being sent on this duty. He said that he was over-worked. There
were at least two sergeants, he claimed furiously, whose turn it
should have been to go on this arduous mission. He was treated
unfairly; he was abused by his superiors; why did any damned fool
ever join the army? As for him he would get out of it as soon as
possible; he was sick of it; the life of a dog. All this he said to
the corporal, who listened attentively, giving grunts of respectful
assent. On the way to this post two privates took occasion to drop
to the rear and pilfer in the orchard of a deserted plantation.
When the sergeant discovered this absence, he grew black with a
rage which was an accumulation of all his irritations. "Run, you!"
he howled. "Bring them here! I'll show them&mdash;" A private ran
swiftly to the rear. The remainder of the squad began to shout
nervously at the two delinquents, whose figures they could see in
the deep shade of the orchard, hurriedly picking fruit from the
ground and cramming it within their shirts, next to their skins.
The beseeching cries of their comrades stirred the criminals more
than did the barking of the sergeant. They ran to rejoin the squad,
while holding their loaded bosoms and with their mouths open with
aggrieved explanations.</p>

<p>Jones faced the sergeant with a horrible cancer marked in bumps
on his left side. The disease of Patterson showed quite around the
front of his waist in many protuberances. "A nice pair!" said the
sergeant, with sudden frigidity. "You're the kind of soldiers a man
wants to choose for a dangerous outpost duty, ain't you?"</p>

<p>The two privates stood at attention, still looking much
aggrieved. "We only&mdash;" began Jones huskily.</p>

<p>"Oh, you 'only!'" cried the sergeant. "Yes, you 'only.' I know
all about that. But if you think you are going to trifle with
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>A moment later the squad moved on towards its station. Behind
the sergeant's back Jones and Patterson were slyly passing apples
and pears to their friends while the sergeant expounded eloquently
to the corporal. "You see what kind of men are in the army now.
Why, when I joined the regiment it was a very different thing, I
can tell you. Then a sergeant had some authority, and if a man
disobeyed orders, he had a very small chance of escaping something
extremely serious. But now! Good God! If I report these men, the
captain will look over a lot of beastly orderly sheets and
say&mdash;'Haw, eh, well, Sergeant Morton, these men seem to have
very good records; very good records, indeed. I can't be too hard
on them; no, not too hard.'" Continued the sergeant: "I tell you,
Flagler, the army is no place for a decent man."</p>

<p>Flagler, the corporal, answered with a sincerity of appreciation
which with him had become a science. "I think you are right,
sergeant," he answered.</p>

<p>Behind them the privates mumbled discreetly. "Damn this sergeant
of ours. He thinks we are made of wood. I don't see any reason for
all this strictness when we are on active service. It isn't like
being at home in barracks! There is no great harm in a couple of
men dropping out to raid an orchard of the enemy when all the world
knows that we haven't had a decent meal in twenty days."</p>

<p>The reddened face of Sergeant Morton suddenly showed to the
rear. "A little more marching and less talking," he said.</p>

<p>When he came to the house he had been ordered to occupy the
sergeant sniffed with disdain. "These people must have lived like
cattle," he said angrily. To be sure, the place was not alluring.
The ground floor had been used for the housing of cattle, and it
was dark and terrible. A flight of steps led to the lofty first
floor, which was denuded but respectable. The sergeant's visage
lightened when he saw the strong walls of stone and cement. "Unless
they turn guns on us, they will never get us out of here," he said
cheerfully to the squad. The men, anxious to keep him in an amiable
mood, all hurriedly grinned and seemed very appreciative and
pleased. "I'll make this into a fortress," he announced. He sent
Jones and Patterson, the two orchard thieves, out on sentry-duty.
He worked the others, then, until he could think of no more things
to tell them to do. Afterwards he went forth, with a
major-general's serious scowl, and examined the ground in front of
his position. In returning he came upon a sentry, Jones, munching
an apple. He sternly commanded him to throw it away.</p>

<p>The men spread their blankets on the floors of the bare rooms,
and putting their packs under their heads and lighting their pipes,
they lived an easy peace. Bees hummed in the garden, and a scent of
flowers came through the open window. A great fan-shaped bit of
sunshine smote the face of one man, and he indolently cursed as he
moved his primitive bed to a shadier place.</p>

<p>Another private explained to a comrade: "This is all nonsense
anyhow. No sense in occupying this post. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, of course," said the corporal, "when she told me herself
that she cared more for me than she did for him, I wasn't going to
stand any of his talk&mdash;" The corporal's listener was so sleepy
that he could only grunt his sympathy.</p>

<p>There was a sudden little spatter of shooting. A cry from Jones
rang out. With no intermediate scrambling, the sergeant leaped
straight to his feet. "Now," he cried, "let us see what you are
made of! If," he added bitterly, "you are made of anything!"</p>

<p>A man yelled: "Good God, can't you see you're all tangled up in
my cartridge belt?"</p>

<p>Another man yelled: "Keep off my legs! Can't you walk on the
floor?"</p>

<p>To the windows there was a blind rush of slumberous men, who
brushed hair from their eyes even as they made ready their rifles.
Jones and Patterson came stumbling up the steps, crying dreadful
information. Already the enemy's bullets were spitting and singing
over the house.</p>

<p>The sergeant suddenly was stiff and cold with a sense of the
importance of the thing. "Wait until you see one," he drawled
loudly and calmly, "then shoot."</p>

<p>For some moments the enemy's bullets swung swifter than
lightning over the house without anybody being able to discover a
target. In this interval a man was shot in the throat. He gurgled,
and then lay down on the floor. The blood slowly waved down the
brown skin of his neck while he looked meekly at his comrades.</p>

<p>There was a howl. "There they are! There they come!" The rifles
crackled. A light smoke drifted idly through the rooms. There was a
strong odor as if from burnt paper and the powder of firecrackers.
The men were silent. Through the windows and about the house the
bullets of an entirely invisible enemy moaned, hummed, spat, burst,
and sang.</p>

<p>The men began to curse. "Why can't we see them?" they muttered
through their teeth. The sergeant was still frigid. He answered
soothingly as if he were directly reprehensible for this behavior
of the enemy. "Wait a moment. You will soon be able to see them.
There! Give it to them!" A little skirt of black figures had
appeared in a field. It was really like shooting at an upright
needle from the full length of a ballroom. But the men's spirits
improved as soon as the enemy&mdash;this mysterious
enemy&mdash;became a tangible thing, and far off. They had believed
the foe to be shooting at them from the adjacent garden.</p>

<p>"Now," said the sergeant ambitiously, "we can beat them off
easily if you men are good enough."</p>

<p>A man called out in a tone of quick, great interest. "See that
fellow on horseback, Bill? Isn't he on horseback? I thought he was
on horseback."</p>

<p>There was a fusilade against another side of the house. The
sergeant dashed into the room which commanded the situation. He
found a dead soldier on the floor. He rushed out howling: "When was
Knowles killed? When was Knowles killed? When was Knowles killed?
Damn it, when was Knowles killed?" It was absolutely essential to
find out the exact moment this man died. A blackened private turned
upon his sergeant and demanded: "How in hell do I know?" Sergeant
Morton had a sense of anger so brief that in the next second he
cried: "Patterson!" He had even forgotten his vital interest in the
time of Knowles' death.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Patterson, his face set with some deep-rooted
quality of determination. Still, he was a mere farm boy.</p>

<p>"Go in to Knowles' window and shoot at those people," said the
sergeant hoarsely. Afterwards he coughed. Some of the fumes of the
fight had made way to his lungs.</p>

<p>Patterson looked at the door into this other room. He looked at
it as if he suspected it was to be his death-chamber. Then he
entered and stood across the body of Knowles and fired vigorously
into a group of plum trees.</p>

<p>"They can't take this house," declared the sergeant in a
contemptuous and argumentative tone. He was apparently replying to
somebody. The man who had been shot in the throat looked up at him.
Eight men were firing from the windows. The sergeant detected in a
corner three wounded men talking together feebly. "Don't you think
there is anything to do?" he bawled. "Go and get Knowles'
cartridges and give them to somebody who can use them! Take
Simpson's too." The man who had been shot in the throat looked at
him. Of the three wounded men who had been talking, one said: "My
leg is all doubled up under me, sergeant." He spoke
apologetically.</p>

<p>Meantime the sergeant was re-loading his rifle. His foot slipped
in the blood of the man who had been shot in the throat, and the
military boot made a greasy red streak on the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, we can hold this place!" shouted the sergeant jubilantly.
"Who says we can't?"</p>

<p>Corporal Flagler suddenly spun away from his window and fell in
a heap.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," murmured a man as he dropped to a seat on the floor
out of danger, "I can't stand this. I swear I can't. I think we
should run away."</p>

<p>Morton, with the kindly eyes of a good shepherd, looked at the
man. "You are afraid, Johnston, you are afraid," he said softly.
The man struggled to his feet, cast upon the sergeant a gaze full
of admiration, reproach, and despair, and returned to his post. A
moment later he pitched forward, and thereafter his body hung out
of the window, his arms straight and the fists clenched.
Incidentally this corpse was pierced afterwards by chance three
times by bullets of the enemy.</p>

<p>The sergeant laid his rifle against the stonework of the
window-frame and shot with care until his magazine was empty.
Behind him a man, simply grazed on the elbow, was wildly sobbing
like a girl. "Damn it, shut up!" said Morton, without turning his
head. Before him was a vista of a garden, fields, clumps of trees,
woods, populated at the time with little fleeting figures.</p>

<p>He grew furious. "Why didn't he send me orders?" he cried aloud.
The emphasis on the word "he" was impressive. A mile back on the
road a galloper of the Hussars lay dead beside his dead horse.</p>

<p>The man who had been grazed on the elbow still set up his bleat.
Morton's fury veered to this soldier. "Can't you shut up? Can't you
shut up? Can't you shut up? Fight! That's the thing to do.
Fight!"</p>

<p>A bullet struck Morton, and he fell upon the man who had been
shot in the throat. There was a sickening moment. Then the sergeant
rolled off to a position upon the bloody floor. He turned himself
with a last effort until he could look at the wounded who were able
to look at him.</p>

<p>"Kim up, the Kickers," he said thickly. His arms weakened and he
dropped on his face.</p>

<p>After an interval a young subaltern of the enemy's infantry,
followed by his eager men, burst into this reeking interior. But
just over the threshold he halted before the scene of blood and
death. He turned with a shrug to his sergeant. "God, I should have
estimated them at least one hundred strong."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>The Upturned Face</h2>

<p>"What will we do now?" said the adjutant, troubled and
excited.</p>

<p>"Bury him," said Timothy Lean.</p>

<p>The two officers looked down close to their toes where lay the
body of their comrade. The face was chalk-blue; gleaming eyes
stared at the sky. Over the two upright figures was a windy sound
of bullets, and on the top of the hill Lean's prostrate company of
Spitzbergen infantry was firing measured volleys.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be better&mdash;" began the adjutant.
"We might leave him until tomorrow."</p>

<p>"No," said Lean. "I can't hold that post an hour longer. I've
got to fall back, and we've got to bury old Bill."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the adjutant, at once. "Your men got
intrenching tools?"</p>

<p>Lean shouted back to his little line, and two men came slowly,
one with a pick, one with a shovel. They started in the direction
of the Rostina sharp-shooters. Bullets cracked near their ears.
"Dig here," said Lean gruffly. The men, thus caused to lower their
glances to the turf, became hurried and frightened merely because
they could not look to see whence the bullets came. The dull beat
of the pick striking the earth sounded amid the swift snap of close
bullets. Presently the other private began to shovel.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the adjutant, slowly, "we'd better search his
clothes for&mdash;things."</p>

<p>Lean nodded. Together in curious abstraction they looked at the
body. Then Lean stirred his shoulders suddenly, arousing
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we'd better see what he's got." He dropped to
his knees, and his hands approached the body of the dead officer.
But his hands wavered over the buttons of the tunic. The first
button was brick-red with drying blood, and he did not seem to dare
touch it.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the adjutant, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Lean stretched his wooden hand, and his fingers fumbled the
blood-stained buttons. At last he rose with ghastly face. He had
gathered a watch, a whistle, a pipe, a tobacco pouch, a
handkerchief, a little case of cards and papers. He looked at the
adjutant. There was a silence. The adjutant was feeling that he had
been a coward to make Lean do all the grisly business.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lean, "that's all, I think. You have his sword and
revolver?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the adjutant, his face working, and then he burst
out in a sudden strange fury at the two privates. "Why don't you
hurry up with that grave? What are you doing, anyhow? Hurry, do you
hear? I never saw such stupid&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he cried out in his passion the two men were laboring
for their lives. Ever overhead the bullets were spitting.</p>

<p>The grave was finished, It was not a masterpiece&mdash;a poor
little shallow thing. Lean and the adjutant again looked at each
other in a curious silent communication.</p>

<p>Suddenly the adjutant croaked out a weird laugh. It was a
terrible laugh, which had its origin in that part of the mind which
is first moved by the singing of the nerves. "Well," he said,
humorously to Lean, "I suppose we had best tumble him in."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lean. The two privates stood waiting, bent over
their implements. "I suppose," said Lean, "it would be better if we
laid him in ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the adjutant. Then apparently remembering that he
had made Lean search the body, he stooped with great fortitude and
took hold of the dead officer's clothing. Lean joined him. Both
were particular that their fingers should not feel the corpse. They
tugged away; the corpse lifted, heaved, toppled, flopped into the
grave, and the two officers, straightening, looked again at each
other&mdash;they were always looking at each other. They sighed
with relief.</p>

<p>The adjutant said, "I suppose we should&mdash;we should say
something. Do you know the service, Tim?"</p>

<p>"They don't read the service until the grave is filled in," said
Lean, pressing his lips to an academic expression.</p>

<p>"Don't they?" said the adjutant, shocked that he had made the
mistake.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he cried, suddenly, "let us&mdash;let us say
something&mdash;while he can hear us."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lean. "Do you know the service?"</p>

<p>"I can't remember a line of it," said the adjutant.</p>

<p>Lean was extremely dubious. "I can repeat two lines,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, do it," said the adjutant. "Go as far as you can. That's
better than nothing. And the beasts have got our range
exactly."</p>

<p>Lean looked at his two men. "Attention," he barked. The privates
came to attention with a click, looking much aggrieved. The
adjutant lowered his helmet to his knee. Lean, bareheaded, he stood
over the grave. The Rostina sharpshooters fired briskly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, our friend has sunk in the deep waters of death,
but his spirit has leaped toward Thee as the bubble arises from the
lips of the drowning. Perceive, we beseech, O Father, the little
flying bubble, and&mdash;".</p>

<p>Lean, although husky and ashamed, had suffered no hesitation up
to this point, but he stopped with a hopeless feeling and looked at
the corpse.</p>

<p>The adjutant moved uneasily. "And from Thy superb
heights&mdash;" he began, and then he too came to an end.</p>

<p>"And from Thy superb heights," said Lean.</p>

<p>The adjutant suddenly remembered a phrase in the back part of
the Spitzbergen burial service, and he exploited it with the
triumphant manner of a man who has recalled everything, and can go
on.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, have mercy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, God, have mercy&mdash;" said Lean.</p>

<p>"Mercy," repeated the adjutant, in quick failure.</p>

<p>"Mercy," said Lean. And then he was moved by some violence of
feeling, for he turned suddenly upon his two men and tigerishly
said, "Throw the dirt in."</p>

<p>The fire of the Rostina sharpshooters was accurate and
continuous.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>One of the aggrieved privates came forward with his shovel. He
lifted his first shovel-load of earth, and for a moment of
inexplicable hesitation it was held poised above this corpse, which
from its chalk-blue face looked keenly out from the grave. Then the
soldier emptied his shovel on&mdash;on the feet.</p>

<p>Timothy Lean felt as if tons had been swiftly lifted from off
his forehead. He had felt that perhaps the private might empty the
shovel on&mdash;on the face. It had been emptied on the feet. There
was a great point gained there&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;the first
shovelful had been emptied on the feet. How satisfactory!</p>

<p>The adjutant began to babble. "Well, of course&mdash;a man we've
messed with all these years&mdash;impossible&mdash;you can't, you
know, leave your intimate friends rotting on the field. Go on, for
God's sake, and shovel, you!"</p>

<p>The man with the shovel suddenly ducked, grabbed his left arm
with his right hand, and looked at his officer for orders. Lean
picked the shovel from the ground. "Go to the rear," he said to the
wounded man. He also addressed the other private. "You get under
cover, too; I'll finish this business."</p>

<p>The wounded man scrambled hard still for the top of the ridge
without devoting any glances to the direction whence the bullets
came, and the other man followed at an equal pace; but he was
different, in that he looked back anxiously three times.</p>

<p>This is merely the way&mdash;often&mdash;of the hit and
unhit.</p>

<p>Timothy Lean filled the shovel, hesitated, and then in a
movement which was like a gesture of abhorrence he flung the dirt
into the grave, and as it landed it made a sound&mdash;plop! Lean
suddenly stopped and mopped his brow&mdash;a tired laborer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have been wrong," said the adjutant. His glance
wavered stupidly. "It might have been better if we hadn't buried
him just at this time. Of course, if we advance to-morrow the body
would have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you," said Lean, "shut your mouth!" He was not the senior
officer.</p>

<p>He again filled the shovel and flung the earth. Always the earth
made that sound&mdash;plop! For a space Lean worked frantically,
like a man digging himself out of danger.</p>

<p>Soon there was nothing to be seen but the chalk-blue face. Lean
filled the shovel. "Good God," he cried to the adjutant. "Why
didn't you turn him somehow when you put him in? This&mdash;" Then
Lean began to stutter.</p>

<p>The adjutant understood. He was pale to the lips. "Go on, man,"
he cried, beseechingly, almost in a shout. Lean swung back the
shovel. It went forward in a pendulum curve. When the earth landed
it made a sound&mdash;plop!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>An Episode of War</h2>

<p>The lieutenant's rubber blanket lay on the ground, and upon it
he had poured the company's supply of coffee. Corporals and other
representatives of the grimy and hot-throated men who lined the
breastwork had come for each squad's portion.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was frowning and serious at this task of
division. His lips pursed as he drew with his sword various
crevices in the heap until brown squares of coffee, astoundingly
equal in size, appeared on the blanket. He was on the verge of a
great triumph in mathematics, and the corporals were thronging
forward, each to reap a little square, when suddenly the lieutenant
cried out and looked quickly at a man near him as if he suspected
it was a case of personal assault. The others cried out also when
they saw blood upon the lieutenant's sleeve.</p>

<p>He had winced like a man stung, swayed dangerously, and then
straightened. The sound of his hoarse breathing was plainly
audible. He looked sadly, mystically, over the breastwork at the
green face of a wood, where now were many little puffs of white
smoke. During this moment the men about him gazed statue-like and
silent, astonished and awed by this catastrophe which happened when
catastrophes were not expected&mdash;when they had leisure to
observe it.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant stared at the wood, they too swung their
heads, so that for another instant all hands, still silent,
contemplated the distant forest as if their minds were fixed upon
the mystery of a bullet's journey.</p>

<p>The officer had, of course, been compelled to take his sword
into his left hand. He did not hold it by the hilt. He gripped it
at the middle of the blade, awkwardly. Turning his eyes from the
hostile wood, he looked at the sword as he held it there, and
seemed puzzled as to what to do with it, where to put it. In short,
this weapon had of a sudden become a strange thing to him. He
looked at it in a kind of stupefaction, as if he had been endowed
with a trident, a sceptre, or a spade.</p>

<p>Finally he tried to sheath it. To sheath a sword held by the
left hand, at the middle of the blade, in a scabbard hung at the
left hip, is a feat worthy of a sawdust ring. This wounded officer
engaged in a desperate struggle with the sword and the wobbling
scabbard, and during the time of it he breathed like a
wrestler.</p>

<p>But at this instant the men, the spectators, awoke from their
stone-like poses and crowded forward sympathetically. The
orderly-sergeant took the sword and tenderly placed it in the
scabbard. At the time, he leaned nervously backward, and did not
allow even his finger to brush the body of the lieutenant. A wound
gives strange dignity to him who bears it. Well men shy from this
new and terrible majesty. It is as if the wounded man's hand is
upon the curtain which hangs before the revelations of all
existence&mdash;the meaning of ants, potentates, wars, cities,
sunshine, snow, a feather dropped from a bird's wing; and the power
of it sheds radiance upon a bloody form, and makes the other men
understand sometimes that they are little. His comrades look at him
with large eyes thoughtfully. Moreover, they fear vaguely that the
weight of a finger upon him might send him headlong, precipitate
the tragedy, hurl him at once into the dim, grey unknown. And so
the orderly-sergeant, while sheathing the sword, leaned nervously
backward.</p>

<p>There were others who proffered assistance. One timidly
presented his shoulder and asked the lieutenant if he cared to lean
upon it, but the latter waved him away mournfully. He wore the look
of one who knows he is the victim of a terrible disease and
understands his helplessness. He again stared over the breastwork
at the forest, and then turning went slowly rearward. He held his
right wrist tenderly in his left hand as if the wounded arm was
made of very brittle glass.</p>

<p>And the men in silence stared at the wood, then at the departing
lieutenant&mdash;then at the wood, then at the lieutenant.</p>

<p>As the wounded officer passed from the line of battle, he was
enabled to see many things which as a participant in the fight were
unknown to him. He saw a general on a black horse gazing over the
lines of blue infantry at the green woods which veiled his
problems. An aide galloped furiously, dragged his horse suddenly to
a halt, saluted, and presented a paper. It was, for a wonder,
precisely like an historical painting.</p>

<p>To the rear of the general and his staff a group, composed of a
bugler, two or three orderlies, and the bearer of the corps
standard, all upon maniacal horses, were working like slaves to
hold their ground, preserve, their respectful interval, while the
shells boomed in the air about them, and caused their chargers to
make furious quivering leaps.</p>

<p>A battery, a tumultuous and shining mass, was swirling toward
the right. The wild thud of hoofs, the cries of the riders shouting
blame and praise, menace and encouragement, and, last the roar of
the wheels, the slant of the glistening guns, brought the
lieutenant to an intent pause. The battery swept in curves that
stirred the heart; it made halts as dramatic as the crash of a wave
on the rocks, and when it fled onward, this aggregation of wheels,
levers, motors, had a beautiful unity, as if it were a missile. The
sound of it was a war-chorus that reached into the depths of man's
emotion.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, still holding his arm as if it were of glass,
stood watching this battery until all detail of it was lost, save
the figures of the riders, which rose and fell and waved lashes
over the black mass.</p>

<p>Later, he turned his eyes toward the battle where the shooting
sometimes crackled like bush-fires, sometimes sputtered with
exasperating irregularity, and sometimes reverberated like the
thunder. He saw the smoke rolling upward and saw crowds of men who
ran and cheered, or stood and blazed away at the inscrutable
distance.</p>

<p>He came upon some stragglers, and they told him how to find the
field hospital. They described its exact location. In fact, these
men, no longer having part in the battle, knew more of it than
others. They told the performance of every corps, every division,
the opinion of every general. The lieutenant, carrying his wounded
arm rearward, looked upon them with wonder.</p>

<p>At the roadside a brigade was making coffee and buzzing with
talk like a girls' boarding-school. Several officers came out to
him and inquired concerning things of which he knew nothing. One,
seeing his arm, began to scold. "Why, man, that's no way to do. You
want to fix that thing." He appropriated the lieutenant and the
lieutenant's wound. He cut the sleeve and laid bare the arm, every
nerve of which softly fluttered under his touch. He bound his
handkerchief over the wound, scolding away in the meantime. His
tone allowed one to think that he was in the habit of being wounded
every day. The lieutenant hung his head, feeling, in this presence,
that he did not know how to be correctly wounded.</p>

<p>The low white tents of the hospital were grouped around an old
school-house. There was here a singular commotion. In the
foreground two ambulances interlocked wheels in the deep mud. The
drivers were tossing the blame of it back and forth, gesticulating
and berating, while from the ambulances, both crammed with wounded,
there came an occasional groan. An interminable crowd of bandaged
men were coming and going. Great numbers sat under the trees
nursing heads or arms or legs. There was a dispute of some kind
raging on the steps of the school-house. Sitting with his back
against a tree a man with a face as grey as a new army blanket was
serenely smoking a corn-cob pipe. The lieutenant wished to rush
forward and inform him that he was dying.</p>

<p>A busy surgeon was passing near the lieutenant. "Good-morning,"
he said, with a friendly smile. Then he caught sight of the
lieutenant's arm and his face at once changed. "Well, let's have a
look at it." He seemed possessed suddenly of a great contempt for
the lieutenant. This wound evidently placed the latter on a very
low social plane. The doctor cried out impatiently, "What
mutton-head had tied it up that way anyhow?" The lieutenant
answered, "Oh, a man."</p>

<p>When the wound was disclosed the doctor fingered it
disdainfully. "Humph," he said. "You come along with me and I'll
'tend to you." His voice contained the same scorn as if he were
saying, "You will have to go to jail."</p>

<p>The lieutenant had been very meek, but now his face flushed, and
he looked into the doctor's eyes. "I guess I won't have it
amputated," he said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! Nonsense! Nonsense!" cried the doctor. "Come
along, now. I won't amputate it. Come along. Don't be a baby."</p>

<p>"Let go of me," said the lieutenant, holding back wrathfully,
his glance fixed upon the door of the old school-house, as sinister
to him as the portals of death.</p>

<p>And this is the story of how the lieutenant lost his arm. When
he reached home, his sisters, his mother, his wife sobbed for a
long time at the sight of the flat sleeve. "Oh, well," he said,
standing shamefaced amid these tears, "I don't suppose it matters
so much as all that."</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>An Experiment in Misery</h2>

<p>It was late at night, and a fine rain was swirling softly down,
causing the pavements to glisten with hue of steel and blue and
yellow in the rays of the innumerable lights. A youth was trudging
slowly, without enthusiasm, with his hands buried deep in his
trousers' pockets, toward the downtown places where beds can be
hired for coppers. He was clothed in an aged and tattered suit, and
his derby was a marvel of dust-covered crown and torn rim. He was
going forth to eat as the wanderer may eat, and sleep as the
homeless sleep. By the time he had reached City Hall Park he was so
completely plastered with yells of "bum" and "hobo," and with
various unholy epithets that small boys had applied to him at
intervals, that he was in a state of the most profound dejection.
The sifting rain saturated the old velvet collar of his overcoat,
and as the wet cloth pressed against his neck, he felt that there
no longer could be pleasure in life. He looked about him searching
for an outcast of highest degree that they too might share
miseries, but the lights threw a quivering glare over rows and
circles of deserted benches that glistened damply, showing patches
of wet sod behind them. It seemed that their usual freights had
fled on this night to better things. There were only squads of
well-dressed Brooklyn people who swarmed towards the bridge.</p>

<p>The young man loitered about for a time and then went shuffling
off down Park Row. In the sudden descent in style of the dress of
the crowd he felt relief, and as if he were at last in his own
country. He began to see tatters that matched his tatters. In
Chatham Square there were aimless men strewn in front of saloons
and lodging-houses, standing sadly, patiently, reminding one
vaguely of the attitudes of chickens in a storm. He aligned himself
with these men, and turned slowly to occupy himself with the
flowing life of the great street.</p>

<p>Through the mists of the cold and storming night, the cable cars
went in silent procession, great affairs shining with red and
brass, moving with formidable power, calm and irresistible,
dangerful and gloomy, breaking silence only by the loud fierce cry
of the gong. Two rivers of people swarmed along the sidewalks,
spattered with black mud, which made each shoe leave a scarlike
impression. Overhead elevated trains with a shrill grinding of the
wheels stopped at the station, which upon its leglike pillars
seemed to resemble some monstrous kind of crab squatting over the
street. The quick fat puffings of the engines could be heard. Down
an alley there were somber curtains of purple and black, on which
street lamps dully glittered like embroidered flowers.</p>

<p>A saloon stood with a voracious air on a corner. A sign leaning
against the front of the door-post announced "Free hot soup
to-night!" The swing doors, snapping to and fro like ravenous lips,
made gratified smacks as the saloon gorged itself with plump men,
eating with astounding and endless appetite, smiling in some
indescribable manner as the men came from all directions like
sacrifices to a heathenish superstition.</p>

<p>Caught by the delectable sign the young man allowed himself to
be swallowed. A bartender placed a schooner of dark and portentous
beer on the bar. Its monumental form upreared until the froth a-top
was above the crown of the young man's brown derby.</p>

<p>"Soup over there, gents," said the bartender affably. A little
yellow man in rags and the youth grasped their schooners and went
with speed toward a lunch counter, where a man with oily but
imposing whiskers ladled genially from a kettle until he had
furnished his two mendicants with a soup that was steaming hot, and
in which there were little floating suggestions of chicken. The
young man, sipping his broth, felt the cordiality expressed by the
warmth of the mixture, and he beamed at the man with oily but
imposing whiskers, who was presiding like a priest behind an altar.
"Have some more, gents?" he inquired of the two sorry figures
before him. The little yellow man accepted with a swift gesture,
but the youth shook his head and went out, following a man whose
wondrous seediness promised that he would have a knowledge of cheap
lodging-houses.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk he accosted the seedy man. "Say, do you know a
cheap place to sleep?"</p>

<p>The other hesitated for a time, gazing sideways. Finally he
nodded in the direction of the street, "I sleep up there," he said,
"when I've got the price."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Ten cents."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>"That's too rich for me."</p>

<p>At that moment there approached the two a reeling man in strange
garments. His head was a fuddle of bushy hair and whiskers, from
which his eyes peered with a guilty slant. In a close scrutiny it
was possible to distinguish the cruel lines of a mouth which looked
as if its lips had just closed with satisfaction over some tender
and piteous morsel. He appeared like an assassin steeped in crimes
performed awkwardly.</p>

<p>But at this time his voice was tuned to the coaxing key of an
affectionate puppy. He looked at the men with wheedling eyes, and
began to sing a little melody for charity.</p>

<p>"Say, gents, can't yeh give a poor feller a couple of cents t'
git a bed? I got five, and I gits anudder two I gits me a bed. Now,
on th' square, gents, can't yeh jest gimme two cents t' git a bed?
Now, yeh know how a respecter'ble gentlem'n feels when he's down on
his luck, an' I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The seedy man, staring with imperturbable countenance at a train
which clattered overhead, interrupted in an expressionless
voice&mdash;"Ah, go t' h&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But the youth spoke to the prayerful assassin in tones of
astonishment and inquiry. "Say, you must be crazy! Why don't yeh
strike somebody that looks as if they had money?"</p>

<p>The assassin, tottering about on his uncertain legs, and at
intervals brushing imaginary obstacles from before his nose,
entered into a long explanation of the psychology of the situation.
It was so profound that it was unintelligible.</p>

<p>When he had exhausted the subject, the young man said to
him:</p>

<p>"Let's see th' five cents."</p>

<p>The assassin wore an expression of drunken woe at this sentence,
filled with suspicion of him. With a deeply pained air he began to
fumble in his clothing, his red hands trembling. Presently he
announced in a voice of bitter grief, as if he had been
betrayed&mdash;"There's on'y four."</p>

<p>"Four," said the young man thoughtfully. "Well, look here, I'm a
stranger here, an' if ye'll steer me to your cheap joint I'll find
the other three."</p>

<p>The assassin's countenance became instantly radiant with joy.
His whiskers quivered with the wealth of his alleged emotions. He
seized the young man's hand in a transport of delight and
friendliness.</p>

<p>"B' Gawd," he cried, "if ye'll do that, b' Gawd, I'd say yeh was
a damned good fellow, I would, an' I'd remember yeh all m' life, I
would, b' Gawd, an' if I ever got a chance I'd return the
compliment"&mdash;he spoke with drunken dignity&mdash;"b' Gawd, I'd
treat yeh white, I would, an' I'd allus remember yeh."</p>

<p>The young man drew back, looking at the assassin coldly. "Oh,
that's all right," he said. "You show me th' joint&mdash;that's all
you've got t' do."</p>

<p>The assassin, gesticulating gratitude, led the young man along a
dark street. Finally he stopped before a little dusty door. He
raised his hand impressively. "Look-a-here," he said, and there was
a thrill of deep and ancient wisdom upon his face, "I've brought
yeh here, an' that's my part, ain't it? If th' place don't suit
yeh, yeh needn't git mad at me, need yeh? There won't be no bad
feelin', will there?"</p>

<p>"No," said the young man.</p>

<p>The assassin waved his arm tragically, and led the march up the
steep stairway. On the way the young man furnished the assassin
with three pennies. At the top a man with benevolent spectacles
looked at them through a hole in a board. He collected their money,
wrote some names on a register, and speedily was leading the two
men along a gloom-shrouded corridor.</p>

<p>Shortly after the beginning of this journey the young man felt
his liver turn white, for from the dark and secret places of the
building there suddenly came to his nostrils strange and
unspeakable odors, that assailed him like malignant diseases with
wings. They seemed to be from human bodies closely packed in dens;
the exhalations from a hundred pairs of reeking lips; the fumes
from a thousand bygone debauches; the expression of a thousand
present miseries.</p>

<p>A man, naked save for a little snuff-colored undershirt, was
parading sleepily along the corridor. He rubbed his eyes, and,
giving vent to a prodigious yawn, demanded to be told the time.</p>

<p>"Half-past one."</p>

<p>The man yawned again. He opened a door, and for a moment his
form was outlined against a black, opaque interior. To this door
came the three men, and as it was again opened the unholy odors
rushed out like fiends, so that the young man was obliged to
struggle as against an overpowering wind.</p>

<p>It was some time before the youth's eyes were good in the
intense gloom within, but the man with benevolent spectacles led
him skilfully, pausing but a moment to deposit the limp assassin
upon a cot. He took the youth to a cot that lay tranquilly by the
window, and showing him a tall locker for clothes that stood near
the head with the ominous air of a tombstone, left him.</p>

<p>The youth sat on his cot and peered about him. There was a
gas-jet in a distant part of the room, that burned a small
flickering orange-hued flame. It caused vast masses of tumbled
shadows in all parts of the place, save where, immediately about
it, there was a little grey haze. As the young man's eyes became
used to the darkness, he could see upon the cots that thickly
littered the floor the forms of men sprawled out, lying in
deathlike silence, or heaving and snoring with tremendous effort,
like stabbed fish.</p>

<p>The youth locked his derby and his shoes in the mummy case near
him, and then lay down with an old and familiar coat around his
shoulders. A blanket he handed gingerly, drawing it over part of
the coat. The cot was covered with leather, and as cold as melting
snow. The youth was obliged to shiver for some time on this affair,
which was like a slab. Presently, however, his chill gave him
peace, and during this period of leisure from it he turned his head
to stare at his friend the assassin, whom he could dimly discern
where he lay sprawled on a cot in the abandon of a man filled with
drink. He was snoring with incredible vigor. His wet hair and beard
dimly glistened, and his inflamed nose shone with subdued lustre
like a red light in a fog.</p>

<p>Within reach of the youth's hand was one who lay with yellow
breast and shoulders bare to the cold drafts. One arm hung over the
side of the cot, and the fingers lay full length upon the wet
cement floor of the room. Beneath the inky brows could be seen the
eyes of the man exposed by the partly opened lids. To the youth it
seemed that he and this corpse-like being were exchanging a
prolonged stare, and that the other threatened with his eyes. He
drew back, watching his neighbor from the shadows of his blanket
edge. The man did not move once through the night, but lay in this
stillness as of death like a body stretched out expectant of the
surgeon's knife.</p>

<p>And all through the room could be seen the tawny hues of naked
flesh, limbs thrust into the darkness, projecting beyond the cots;
upreared knees, arms hanging long and thin over the cot edges. For
the most part they were statuesque, carven, dead. With the curious
lockers standing all about like tombstones, there was a strange
effect of a graveyard where bodies were merely flung.</p>

<p>Yet occasionally could be seen limbs wildly tossing in fantastic
nightmare gestures, accompanied by guttural cries, grunts, oaths.
And there was one fellow off in a gloomy corner, who in his dreams
was oppressed by some frightful calamity, for of a sudden he began
to utter long wails that went almost like yells from a hound,
echoing wailfully and weird through this chill place of tombstones
where men lay like the dead.</p>

<p>The sound in its high piercing beginnings, that dwindled to
final melancholy moans, expressed a red and grim tragedy of the
unfathomable possibilities of the man's dreams. But to the youth
these were not merely the shrieks of a vision-pierced man: they
were an utterance of the meaning of the room and its occupants. It
was to him the protest of the wretch who feels the touch of the
imperturbable granite wheels, and who then cries with an impersonal
eloquence, with a strength not from him, giving voice to the wail
of a whole section, a class, a people. This, weaving into the young
man's brain, and mingling with his views of the vast and sombre
shadows that, like mighty black fingers, curled around the naked
bodies, made the young man so that he did not sleep, but lay
carving the biographies for these men from his meagre experience.
At times the fellow in the corner howled in a writhing agony of his
imaginations.</p>

<p>Finally a long lance-point of grey light shot through the dusty
panes of the window. Without, the young man could see roofs
drearily white in the dawning. The point of light yellowed and grew
brighter, until the golden rays of the morning sun came in bravely
and strong. They touched with radiant color the form of a small fat
man, who snored in stuttering fashion. His round and shiny bald
head glowed suddenly with the valor of a decoration. He sat up,
blinked at the sun, swore fretfully, and pulled his blanket over
the ornamental splendors of his head.</p>

<p>The youth contentedly watched this rout of the shadows before
the bright spears of the sun, and presently he slumbered. When he
awoke he heard the voice of the assassin raised in valiant curses.
Putting up his head, he perceived his comrade seated on the side of
the cot engaged in scratching his neck with long finger-nails that
rasped like files.</p>

<p>"Hully Jee, dis is a new breed. They've got can-openers on their
feet." He continued in a violent tirade.</p>

<p>The young man hastily unlocked his closet and took out his shoes
and hat. As he sat on the side of the cot lacing his shoes, he
glanced about and saw that daylight had made the room comparatively
commonplace and uninteresting. The men, whose faces seemed stolid,
serene or absent, were engaged in dressing, while a great crackle
of bantering conversation arose.</p>

<p>A few were parading in unconcerned nakedness. Here and there
were men of brawn, whose skins shone clear and ruddy. They took
splendid poses, standing massively like chiefs. When they had
dressed in their ungainly garments there was an extraordinary
change. They then showed bumps and deficiencies of all kinds.</p>

<p>There were others who exhibited many deformities. Shoulders were
slanting, humped, pulled this way and pulled that way. And notable
among these latter men was the little fat man who had refused to
allow his head to be glorified. His pudgy form, builded like a
pear, bustled to and fro, while he swore in fishwife fashion. It
appeared that some article of his apparel had vanished.</p>

<p>The young man attired speedily, and went to his friend the
assassin. At first the latter looked dazed at the sight of the
youth. This face seemed to be appealing to him through the cloud
wastes of his memory. He scratched his neck and reflected. At last
he grinned, a broad smile gradually spreading until his countenance
was a round illumination. "Hello, Willie," he cried cheerily.</p>

<p>"Hello," said the young man. "Are yeh ready t' fly?"</p>

<p>"Sure." The assassin tied his shoe carefully with some twine and
came ambling.</p>

<p>When he reached the street the young man experienced no sudden
relief from unholy atmospheres. He had forgotten all about them,
and had been breathing naturally, and with no sensation of
discomfort or distress.</p>

<p>He was thinking of these things as he walked along the street,
when he was suddenly startled by feeling the assassin's hand,
trembling with excitement, clutching his arm, and when the assassin
spoke, his voice went into quavers from a supreme agitation.</p>

<p>"I'll be hully, bloomin' blowed if there wasn't a feller with a
nightshirt on up there in that joint."</p>

<p>The youth was bewildered for a moment, but presently he turned
to smile indulgently at the assassin's humor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a d&mdash;d liar," he merely said.</p>

<p>Whereupon the assassin began to gesture extravagantly, and take
oath by strange gods. He frantically placed himself at the mercy of
remarkable fates if his tale were not true.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did! I cross m' heart thousan' times!" he protested,
and at the moment his eyes were large with amazement, his mouth
wrinkled in unnatural glee.</p>

<p>"Yessir! A nightshirt! A hully white nightshirt!"</p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>"No, sir! I hope ter die b'fore I kin git anudder ball if there
wasn't a jay wid a hully, bloomin' white nightshirt!"</p>

<p>His face was filled with the infinite wonder of it. "A hully
white nightshirt," he continually repeated.</p>

<p>The young man saw the dark entrance to a basement restaurant.
There was a sign which read "No mystery about our hash"! and there
were other age-stained and world-battered legends which told him
that the place was within his means. He stopped before it and spoke
to the assassin. "I guess I'll git somethin' t' eat."</p>

<p>At this the assassin, for some reason, appeared to be quite
embarrassed. He gazed at the seductive front of the eating place
for a moment. Then he started slowly up the street. "Well,
good-bye, Willie," he said bravely.</p>

<p>For an instant the youth studied the departing figure. Then he
called out, "Hol' on a minnet." As they came together he spoke in a
certain fierce way, as if he feared that the other would think him
to be charitable. "Look-a-here, if yeh wanta git some breakfas'
I'll lend yeh three cents t' do it with. But say, look-a-here,
you've gota git out an' hustle. I ain't goin' t' support yeh, or
I'll go broke b'fore night. I ain't no millionaire."</p>

<p>"I take me oath, Willie," said the assassin earnestly, "th' on'y
thing I really needs is a ball. Me t'roat feels like a fryin'-pan.
But as I can't get a ball, why, th' next bes' thing is breakfast,
an' if yeh do that for me, b'Gawd, I say yeh was th' whitest lad I
ever see."</p>

<p>They spent a few moments in dexterous exchanges of phrases, in
which they each protested that the other was, as the assassin had
originally said, "a respecter'ble gentlem'n." And they concluded
with mutual assurances that they were the souls of intelligence and
virtue. Then they went into the restaurant.</p>

<p>There was a long counter, dimly lighted from hidden sources. Two
or three men in soiled white aprons rushed here and there.</p>

<p>The youth bought a bowl of coffee for two cents and a roll for
one cent. The assassin purchased the same. The bowls were webbed
with brown seams, and the tin spoons wore an air of having emerged
from the first pyramid. Upon them were black mosslike encrustations
of age, and they were bent and scarred from the attacks of
long-forgotten teeth. But over their repast the wanderers waxed
warm and mellow. The assassin grew affable as the hot mixture went
soothingly down his parched throat, and the young man felt courage
flow in his veins.</p>

<p>Memories began to throng in on the assassin, and he brought
forth long tales, intricate, incoherent, delivered with a
chattering swiftness as from an old woman. "&mdash;great job out'n
Orange. Boss keep yeh hustlin' though all time. I was there three
days, and then I went an' ask 'im t' lend me a dollar. 'G-g-go ter
the devil,' he ses, an' I lose me job."</p>

<p>"South no good. Damn niggers work for twenty-five an' thirty
cents a day. Run white man out. Good grub, though. Easy
livin'."</p>

<p>"Yas; useter work little in Toledo, raftin' logs. Make two or
three dollars er day in the spring. Lived high. Cold as ice,
though, in the winter."</p>

<p>"I was raised in northern N'York. O-a-ah, yeh jest oughto live
there. No beer ner whisky, though, way off in the woods. But all
th' good hot grub yeh can eat. B'Gawd, I hung around there long as
I could till th' ol' man fired me. 'Git t' hell outa here, yeh
wuthless skunk, git t' hell outa here, an' go die,' he ses. 'You're
a hell of a father,' I ses, 'you are,' an' I quit 'im."</p>

<p>As they were passing from the dim eating place, they encountered
an old man who was trying to steal forth with a tiny package of
food, but a tall man with an indomitable moustache stood dragon
fashion, barring the way of escape. They heard the old man raise a
plaintive protest. "Ah, you always want to know what I take out,
and you never see that I usually bring a package in here from my
place of business."</p>

<p>As the wanderers trudged slowly along Park Row, the assassin
began to expand and grow blithe. "B'Gawd, we've been livin' like
kings," he said, smacking appreciative lips.</p>

<p>"Look out, or we'll have t' pay fer it t'night," said the youth
with gloomy warning.</p>

<p>But the assassin refused to turn his gaze toward the future. He
went with a limping step, into which he injected a suggestion of
lamblike gambols. His mouth was wreathed in a red grin.</p>

<p>In the City Hall Park the two wanderers sat down in the little
circle of benches sanctified by traditions of their class. They
huddled in their old garments, slumbrously conscious of the march
of the hours which for them had no meaning.</p>

<p>The people of the street hurrying hither and thither made a
blend of black figures changing yet frieze-like. They walked in
their good clothes as upon important missions, giving no gaze to
the two wanderers seated upon the benches. They expressed to the
young man his infinite distance from all that he valued. Social
position, comfort, the pleasures of living, were unconquerable
kingdoms. He felt a sudden awe.</p>

<p>And in the background a multitude of buildings, of pitiless hues
and sternly high, were to him emblematic of a nation forcing its
regal head into the clouds, throwing no downward glances; in the
sublimity of its aspirations ignoring the wretches who may flounder
at its feet. The roar of the city in his ear was to him the
confusion of strange tongues, babbling heedlessly; it was the clink
of coin, the voice if the city's hopes which were to him no
hopes.</p>

<p>He confessed himself an outcast, and his eyes from under the
lowered rim of his hat began to glance guiltily, wearing the
criminal expression that comes with certain convictions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>The Duel that was Not Fought</h2>

<p>Patsy Tulligan was not as wise as seven owls, but his courage
could throw a shadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral. There
were men on Cherry Street who had whipped him five times, but they
all knew that Patsy would be as ready for the sixth time as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Once he and two friends had been away up on Eighth Avenue, far
out of their country, and upon their return journey that evening
they stopped frequently in saloons until they were as independent
of their surroundings as eagles, and cared much less about thirty
days on Blackwell's.</p>

<p>On Lower Sixth Avenue they paused in a saloon where there was a
good deal of lamp-glare and polished wood to be seen from the
outside, and within, the mellow light shone on much furbished brass
and more polished wood. It was a better saloon than they were in
the habit of seeing, but they did not mind it. They sat down at one
of the little tables that were in a row parallel to the bar and
ordered beer. They blinked stolidly at the decorations, the
bartender, and the other customers. When anything transpired they
discussed it with dazzling frankness, and what they said of it was
as free as air to the other people in the place.</p>

<p>At midnight there were few people in the saloon. Patsy and his
friends still sat drinking. Two well-dressed men were at another
table, smoking cigars slowly and swinging back in their chairs.
They occupied themselves with themselves in the usual manner, never
betraying by a wink of an eyelid that they knew that other folk
existed. At another table directly behind Patsy and his companions
was a slim little Cuban, with miraculously small feet and hands,
and with a youthful touch of down upon his lip. As he lifted his
cigarette from time to time his little finger was bended in dainty
fashion, and there was a green flash when a huge emerald ring
caught the light. The bartender came often with his little brass
tray. Occasionally Patsy and his two friends quarrelled.</p>

<p>Once this little Cuban happened to make some slight noise and
Patsy turned his head to observe him. Then Patsy made a careless
and rather loud comment to his two friends. He used a word which is
no more than passing the time of day down in Cherry Street, but to
the Cuban it was a dagger-point. There was a harsh scraping sound
as a chair was pushed swiftly back.</p>

<p>The little Cuban was upon his feet. His eyes were shining with a
rage that flashed there like sparks as he glared at Patsy. His
olive face had turned a shade of grey from his anger. Withal his
chest was thrust out in portentous dignity, and his hand, still
grasping his wine-glass, was cool and steady, the little finger
still bended, the great emerald gleaming upon it. The others,
motionless, stared at him.</p>

<p>"Sir," he began ceremoniously. He spoke gravely and in a slow
way, his tone coming in a marvel of self-possessed cadences from
between those lips which quivered with wrath. "You have insult me.
You are a dog, a hound, a cur. I spit upon you. I must have some of
your blood."</p>

<p>Patsy looked at him over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's th' matter wi' che?" he demanded. He did not quite
understand the words of this little man who glared at him steadily,
but he knew that it was something about fighting. He snarled with
the readiness of his class and heaved his shoulders contemptuously.
"Ah, what's eatin' yeh? Take a walk! You hain't got nothin' t' do
with me, have yeh? Well, den, go sit on yerself."</p>

<p>And his companions leaned back valorously in their chairs, and
scrutinized this slim young fellow who was addressing Patsy.</p>

<p>"What's de little Dago chewin' about?"</p>

<p>"He wants t' scrap!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>The Cuban listened with apparent composure. It was only when
they laughed that his body cringed as if he was receiving lashes.
Presently he put down his glass and walked over to their table. He
proceeded always with the most impressive deliberation.</p>

<p>"Sir," he began again. "You have insult me. I must have
s-s-satisfac-shone. I must have your body upon the point of my
sword. In my country you would already be dead. I must have
s-s-satisfac-shone."</p>

<p>Patsy had looked at the Cuban with a trifle of bewilderment. But
at last his face began to grow dark with belligerency, his mouth
curved in that wide sneer with which he would confront an angel of
darkness. He arose suddenly in his seat and came towards the little
Cuban. He was going to be impressive too.</p>

<p>"Say, young feller, if yeh go shootin' off yer face at me, I'll
wipe d' joint wid yeh. What'cher gaffin' about, hey? Are yeh givin'
me er jolly? Say, if yeh pick me up fer a cinch, I'll fool yeh.
Dat's what! Don't take me fer no dead easy mug." And as he glowered
at the little Cuban, he ended his oration with one eloquent word,
"Nit!"</p>

<p>The bartender nervously polished his bar with a towel, and kept
his eyes fastened upon the men. Occasionally he became transfixed
with interest, leaning forward with one hand upon the edge of the
bar and the other holding the towel grabbed in a lump, as if he had
been turned into bronze when in the very act of polishing.</p>

<p>The Cuban did not move when Patsy came toward him and delivered
his oration. At its conclusion he turned his livid face toward
where, above him, Patsy was swaggering and heaving his shoulders in
a consummate display of bravery and readiness. The Cuban, in his
clear, tense tones, spoke one word. It was the bitter insult. It
seemed fairly to spin from his lips and crackle in the air like
breaking glass.</p>

<p>Every man save the little Cuban made an electric movement. Patsy
roared a black oath and thrust himself forward until he towered
almost directly above the other man. His fists were doubled into
knots of bone and hard flesh. The Cuban had raised a steady
finger.</p>

<p>"If you touch me wis your hand, I will keel you."</p>

<p>The two well-dressed men had come swiftly, uttering protesting
cries. They suddenly intervened in this second of time in which
Patsy had sprung forward and the Cuban had uttered his threat. The
four men were now a tossing, arguing; violent group, one
well-dressed man lecturing the Cuban, and the other holding off
Patsy, who was now wild with rage, loudly repeating the Cuban's
threat, and maneuvering and struggling to get at him for revenge's
sake.</p>

<p>The bartender, feverishly scouring away with his towel, and at
times pacing to and fro with nervous and excited tread, shouted
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, for heaven's sake, don't fight in here. If yeh wanta
fight, go out in the street and fight all yeh please. But don't
fight in here."</p>

<p>Patsy knew one only thing, and this he kept repeating:</p>

<p>"Well, he wants t' scrap! I didn't begin dis! He wants t'
scrap."</p>

<p>The well-dressed man confronting him continually
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, well, now, look here, he's only a lad. He don't know what
he's doing. He's crazy mad. You wouldn't slug a kid like that."</p>

<p>Patsy and his aroused companions, who cursed and growled, were
persistent with their argument. "Well, he wants t' scrap!" The
whole affair was as plain as daylight when one saw this great fact.
The interference and intolerable discussion brought the three of
them forward, battleful and fierce.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you, anyhow?" they demanded. "Dis ain't your
business, is it? What business you got shootin' off your face?"</p>

<p>The other peacemaker was trying to restrain the little Cuban,
who had grown shrill and violent.</p>

<p>"If he touch me wis his hand I will keel him. We must fight like
gentlemen or else I keel him when he touch me wis his hand."</p>

<p>The man who was fending off Patsy comprehended these sentences
that were screamed behind his back, and he explained to Patsy.</p>

<p>"But he wants to fight you with swords. With swords, you
know."</p>

<p>The Cuban, dodging around the peacemakers, yelled in Patsy's
face&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could get you before me wis my sword! Ah! Ah! A-a-ah!"
Patsy made a furious blow with a swift fist, but the peacemakers
bucked against his body suddenly like football players.</p>

<p>Patsy was greatly puzzled. He continued doggedly to try to get
near enough to the Cuban to punch him. To these attempts the Cuban
replied savagely&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you touch me wis your hand, I will cut your heart in two
piece."</p>

<p>At last Patsy said&mdash;"Well, if he's so dead stuck on
fightin' wid swords, I'll fight 'im. Soitenly! I'll fight 'im." All
this palaver had evidently tired him, and he now puffed out his
lips with the air of a man who is willing to submit to any
conditions if he can only bring on the row soon enough. He
swaggered, "I'll fight 'im wid swords. Let 'im bring on his swords,
an' I'll fight 'im 'til he's ready t' quit."</p>

<p>The two well-dressed men grinned. "Why, look here," they said to
Patsy, "he'd punch you full of holes. Why he's a fencer. You can't
fight him with swords. He'd kill you in 'bout a minute."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow," said Patsy,
stouthearted and resolute. "I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow, an'
I'll stay wid 'im as long as I kin."</p>

<p>As for the Cuban, his lithe body was quivering in an ecstasy of
the muscles. His face radiant with a savage joy, he fastened his
glance upon Patsy, his eyes gleaming with a gloating, murderous
light. A most unspeakable, animal-like rage was in his
expression.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! He will fight me! Ah!" He bended unconsciously in the
posture of a fencer. He had all the quick, springy movements of a
skilful swordsman. "Ah, the b-r-r-rute! The b-r-r-rute! I will
stick him like a pig!"</p>

<p>The two peacemakers, still grinning broadly, were having a great
time with Patsy.</p>

<p>"Why, you infernal idiot, this man would slice you all up. You
better jump off the bridge if you want to commit suicide. You
wouldn't stand a ghost of a chance to live ten seconds."</p>

<p>Patsy was as unshaken as granite. "Well, if he wants t' fight
wid swords, he'll get it. I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow."</p>

<p>One man said&mdash;"Well, have you got a sword? Do you know what
a sword is? Have you got a sword?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't got none," said Patsy honestly, "but I kin git
one." Then he added valiantly&mdash;"An' quick, too."</p>

<p>The two men laughed. "Why, can't you understand it would be sure
death to fight a sword duel with this fellow?"</p>

<p>"Dat's all right! See? I know me own business. If he wants t'
fight one of dees d&mdash;n duels, I'm in it, understan'"</p>

<p>"Have you ever fought one, you fool?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't. But I will fight one, dough! I ain't no muff. If
he wants t' fight a duel, by Gawd, I'm wid 'im! D'yeh understan'
dat!" Patsy cocked his hat and swaggered. He was getting very
serious.</p>

<p>The little Cuban burst out&mdash;"Ah, come on, sirs: come on! We
can take cab. Ah, you big cow, I will stick you, I will stick you.
Ah, you will look very beautiful, very beautiful. Ah, come on,
sirs. We will stop at hotel&mdash;my hotel. I there have
weapons."</p>

<p>"Yeh will, will yeh? Yeh bloomin' little black Dago!" cried
Patsy in hoarse and maddened reply to the personal part of the
Cuban's speech. He stepped forward. "Git yer d&mdash;n swords," he
commanded. "Git yer swords. Git 'em quick! I'll fight wi' che! I'll
fight wid anyt'ing, too! See? I'll fight yeh wid a knife an' fork
if yeh say so! I'll fight yer standin' up er sittin' down!" Patsy
delivered this intense oration with sweeping, intensely emphatic
gestures, his hands stretched out eloquently, his jaw thrust
forward, his eyes glaring.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the little Cuban joyously. "Ah, you are in very
pretty temper. Ah, how I will cut your heart in two piece, my dear,
d-e-a-r friend." His eyes, too, shone like carbuncles, with a
swift, changing glitter, always fastened upon Patsy's face.</p>

<p>The two peacemakers were perspiring and in despair. One of them
blurted out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blamed if this ain't the most ridiculous thing I
ever saw."</p>

<p>The other said&mdash;"For ten dollars I'd be tempted to let
these two infernal blockheads have their duel."</p>

<p>Patsy was strutting to and fro, and conferring grandly with his
friends.</p>

<p>"He took me for a muff. He t'ought he was goin' t' bluff me out,
talkin' 'bout swords. He'll get fooled." He addressed the
Cuban&mdash;"You're a fine little dirty picter of a scrapper, ain't
che? I'll chew yez up, dat's what I will!"</p>

<p>There began then some rapid action. The patience of well-dressed
men is not an eternal thing. It began to look as if it would at
last be a fight with six corners to it. The faces of the men were
shining red with anger. They jostled each other defiantly, and
almost every one blazed out at three or four of the others. The
bartender had given up protesting. He swore for a time and banged
his glasses. Then he jumped the bar and ran out of the saloon,
cursing sullenly.</p>

<p>When he came back with a policeman, Patsy and the Cuban were
preparing to depart together. Patsy was delivering his last
oration&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll fight yer wid swords! Sure I will! Come ahead, Dago! I'll
fight yeh anywheres wid anyt'ing! We'll have a large, juicy scrap,
an' don't yeh forgit dat! I'm right wid yez. I ain't no muff! I
scrap with a man jest as soon as he ses scrap, an' if yeh wanta
scrap, I'm yer kitten. Understan' dat?"</p>

<p>The policeman said sharply&mdash;"Come, now; what's all this?"
He had a distinctly business air.</p>

<p>The little Cuban stepped forward calmly. "It is none of your
business."</p>

<p>The policeman flushed to his ears. "What?"</p>

<p>One well-dressed man touched the other on the sleeve. "Here's
the time to skip," he whispered. They halted a block away from the
saloon and watched the policeman pull the Cuban through the door.
There was a minute of scuffle on the sidewalk, and into this
deserted street at midnight fifty people appeared at once as if
from the sky to watch it.</p>

<p>At last the three Cherry Hill men came from the saloon, and
swaggered with all their old valor toward the peacemakers.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Patsy to them, "he was so hot talkin' about this duel
business, but I would a-given 'im a great scrap, an' don't yeh
forgit it."</p>

<p>For Patsy was not as wise as seven owls, but his courage could
throw a shadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>A Desertion</h2>

<p>The yellow gaslight that came with an effect of difficulty
through the dust-stained windows on either side of the door gave
strange hues to the faces and forms of the three women who stood
gabbling in the hallway of the tenement. They made rapid gestures,
and in the background their enormous shadows mingled in terrific
conflict.</p>

<p>"Aye, she ain't so good as he thinks she is, I'll bet. He can
watch over 'er an' take care of 'er all he pleases, but when she
wants t' fool 'im, she'll fool 'im. An' how does he know she ain't
foolin' im' now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he thinks he's keepin' 'er from goin' t' th' bad, he does.
Oh, yes. He ses she's too purty t' let run round alone. Too purty!
Huh! My Sadie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, he keeps a clost watch on 'er, you bet. On'y las' week,
she met my boy Tim on th' stairs, an' Tim hadn't said two words to
'er b'fore th' ol' man begin to holler. 'Dorter, dorter, come here,
come here!'"</p>

<p>At this moment a young girl entered from the street, and it was
evident from the injured expression suddenly assumed by the three
gossipers that she had been the object of their discussion. She
passed them with a slight nod, and they swung about into a row to
stare after her.</p>

<p>On her way up the long flights the girl unfastened her veil. One
could then clearly see the beauty of her eyes, but there was in
them a certain furtiveness that came near to marring the effects.
It was a peculiar fixture of gaze, brought from the street, as of
one who there saw a succession of passing dangers with menaces
aligned at every corner.</p>

<p>On the top floor, she pushed open a door and then paused on the
threshold, confronting an interior that appeared black and flat
like a curtain. Perhaps some girlish idea of hobgoblins assailed
her then, for she called in a little breathless voice,
"Daddie!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. The fire in the cooking-stove in the room
crackled at spasmodic intervals. One lid was misplaced, and the
girl could now see that this fact created a little flushed crescent
upon the ceiling. Also, a series of tiny windows in the stove
caused patches of red upon the floor. Otherwise, the room was
heavily draped with shadows.</p>

<p>The girl called again, "Daddie!"</p>

<p>Yet there was no reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddie!"</p>

<p>Presently she laughed as one familiar with the humors of an old
man. "Oh, I guess yer cussin' mad about yer supper, Dad," she said,
and she almost entered the room, but suddenly faltered, overcome by
a feminine instinct to fly from this black interior, peopled with
imagined dangers.</p>

<p>Again she called, "Daddie!" Her voice had an accent of appeal.
It was as if she knew she was foolish but yet felt obliged to
insist upon being reassured. "Oh, Daddie!"</p>

<p>Of a sudden a cry of relief, a feminine announcement that the
stars still hung, burst from her. For, according to some mystic
process, the smoldering coals of the fire went aflame with sudden,
fierce brilliance, splashing parts of the walls, the floor, the
crude furniture, with a hue of blood-red. And in the light of this
dramatic outburst of light, the girl saw her father seated at a
table with his back turned toward her.</p>

<p>She entered the room, then, with an aggrieved air, her logic
evidently concluding that somebody was to blame for her nervous
fright. "Oh, yer on'y sulkin' 'bout yer supper. I thought mebbe
ye'd gone somewheres."</p>

<p>Her father made no reply. She went over to a shelf in the
corner, and, taking a little lamp, she lit it and put it where it
would give her light as she took off her hat and jacket in front of
the tiny mirror. Presently she began to bustle among the cooking
utensils that were crowded into the sink, and as she worked she
rattled talk at her father, apparently disdaining his mood.</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' come home earlier t'night, Dad, on'y that fly foreman,
he kep' me in th' shop 'til half-past six. What a fool! He came t'
me, yeh know, an' he ses, 'Nell, I wanta give yeh some brotherly
advice.' Oh, I know him an' his brotherly advice. 'I wanta give yeh
some brotherly advice. Yer too purty, Nell,' he ses, 't' be workin'
in this shop an' paradin' through the streets alone, without
somebody t' give yeh good brotherly advice, an' I wanta warn yeh,
Nell. I'm a bad man, but I ain't as bad as some, an' I wanta warn
yeh.' 'Oh, g'long 'bout yer business,' I ses. I know 'im. He's like
all of 'em, on'y he's a little slyer. I know 'im. 'You g'long 'bout
yer business,' I ses. Well, he ses after a while that he guessed
some evenin' he'd come up an' see me. 'Oh, yeh will,' I ses, 'yeh
will? Well, you jest let my ol' man ketch yeh comin' foolin' 'round
our place. Yeh'll wish yeh went t' some other girl t' give
brotherly advice.' 'What th' 'ell do I care fer yer father?' he
ses. 'What's he t' me?' 'If he throws yeh downstairs, yeh'll care
for 'im,' I ses. 'Well,' he ses, 'I'll come when 'e ain't in, b'
Gawd, I'll come when 'e ain't in.' 'Oh, he's allus in when it means
takin' care 'o me,' I ses. 'Don't yeh fergit it, either. When it
comes t' takin' care o' his dorter, he's right on deck every single
possible time.'"</p>

<p>After a time, she turned and addressed cheery words to the old
man.</p>

<p>"Hurry up th' fire, Daddie! We'll have supper pretty soon."</p>

<p>But still her father was silent, and his form in its sullen
posture was motionless.</p>

<p>At this, the girl seemed to see the need of the inauguration of
a feminine war against a man out of temper. She approached him
breathing soft, coaxing syllables.</p>

<p>"Daddie! Oh, Daddie! O&mdash;o&mdash;oh, Daddie!"</p>

<p>It was apparent from a subtle quality of valor in her tones that
this manner of onslaught upon his moods had usually been
successful, but to-night it had no quick effect. The words, coming
from her lips, were like the refrain of an old ballad, but the man
remained stolid.</p>

<p>"Daddie! My Daddie! Oh, Daddie, are yeh mad at me,
really&mdash;truly mad at me!"</p>

<p>She touched him lightly upon the arm. Should he have turned then
he would have seen the fresh, laughing face, with dew-sparkling
eyes, close to his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddie! My Daddie! Pretty Daddie!"</p>

<p>She stole her arm about his neck, and then slowly bended her
face toward his. It was the action of a queen who knows that she
reigns notwithstanding irritations, trials, tempests.</p>

<p>But suddenly, from this position, she leaped backward with the
mad energy of a frightened colt. Her face was in this instant
turned to a grey, featureless thing of horror. A yell, wild and
hoarse as a brute-cry, burst from her. "Daddie!" She flung herself
to a place near the door, where she remained, crouching, her eyes
staring at the motionless figure, spattered by the quivering
flashes from the fire. Her arms extended, and her frantic fingers
at once besought and repelled. There was in them an expression of
eagerness to caress and an expression of the most intense loathing.
And the girl's hair that had been a splendor, was in these moments
changed to a disordered mass that hung and swayed in witchlike
fashion.</p>

<p>Again, a terrible cry burst from her. It was more than the
shriek of agony&mdash;it was directed, personal, addressed to him
in the chair, the first word of a tragic conversation with the
dead.</p>

<p>It seemed that when she had put her arm about its neck, she had
jostled the corpse in such a way that now she and it were face to
face. The attitude expressed an intention of arising from the
table. The eyes, fixed upon hers, were filled with an unspeakable
hatred.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The cries of the girl aroused thunders in the tenement. There
was a loud slamming of doors, and presently there was a roar of
feet upon the boards of the stairway. Voices rang out sharply.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What's th' matter?"</p>

<p>"He's killin' her!"</p>

<p>"Slug 'im with anythin' yeh kin lay hold of, Jack!"</p>

<p>But over all this came the shrill, shrewish tones of a woman.
"Ah, th' damned ol' fool, he's drivin' 'er inteh th'
street&mdash;that's what he's doin'. He's drivin' 'er inteh th'
street."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>A Dark-Brown Dog</h2>

<p>A child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one
shoulder against a high board fence and swayed the other to and
fro, the while kicking carelessly at the gravel.</p>

<p>Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised
yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering
trucks moved with indistinctness through it. The child stood
dreamily gazing.</p>

<p>After a time, a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an
intent air down the sidewalk. A short rope was dragging from his
neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it and stumbled.</p>

<p>He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other.
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little
advances with his tail. The child put out his hand and called him.
In an apologetic manner the dog came close, and the two had an
interchange of friendly pattings and waggles. The dog became more
enthusiastic with each moment of the interview, until with his
gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon
the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the
head.</p>

<p>This thing seemed to overpower and astonish the little
dark-brown dog, and wounded him to the heart. He sank down in
despair at the child's feet. When the blow was repeated, together
with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over upon his
back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with
his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.</p>

<p>He looked so comical on his back, and holding his paws
peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and gave him little
taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog took
this chastisement in the most serious way and no doubt considered
that he had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely
and showed his repentance in every way that was in his power. He
pleaded with the child and petitioned him, and offered more
prayers.</p>

<p>At last the child grew weary of this amusement and turned toward
home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on his back and
turned his eyes upon the retreating form.</p>

<p>Presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child.
The latter wandered in a perfunctory way toward his home, stopping
at times to investigate various matters. During one of these pauses
he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following him with
the air of a footpad.</p>

<p>The child beat his pursuer with a small stick he had found. The
dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and resumed
his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit
again.</p>

<p>On the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the
dog, proclaiming with childish gestures that he held him in
contempt as an unimportant dog, with no value save for a moment.
For being this quality of animal the dog apologized and eloquently
expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the child.
His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.</p>

<p>When the child reached his doorstep, the dog was industriously
ambling a few yards in the rear. He became so agitated with shame
when he again confronted the child that he forgot the dragging
rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.</p>

<p>The child sat down on the step and the two had another
interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to please the
child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child
suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift,
avaricious charge and seized the rope.</p>

<p>He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways in
a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not
hobble very skilfully up the stairs because he was very small and
soft, and at last the pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic
that the dog became panic-stricken. In his mind he was being
dragged toward a grim unknown. His eyes grew wild with the terror
of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically and to brace his
legs.</p>

<p>The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on the
stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed
in his purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his
acquirement to the door of his home, and finally with triumph
across the threshold.</p>

<p>No one was in. The child sat down on the floor and made
overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly accepted. He beamed
with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they were firm
and abiding comrades.</p>

<p>When the child's family appeared, they made a great row. The dog
was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was leveled
at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and
drooped like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the
center of the floor, and, at the top of his voice, championed the
dog. It happened that he was roaring protestations, with his arms
clasped about the dog's neck, when the father of the family came in
from work.</p>

<p>The parent demanded to know what the blazes they were making the
kid howl for. It was explained in many words that the infernal kid
wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.</p>

<p>A family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but
he in no way heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the
child's dress.</p>

<p>The affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it
appears, was in a particularly savage temper that evening, and when
he perceived that it would amaze and anger everybody if such a dog
were allowed to remain, he decided that it should be so. The child,
crying softly, took his friend off to a retired part of the room to
hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce rebellion of his
wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the
household.</p>

<p>He and the child were associated together at all times save when
the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the
large folk kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made
loud and violent objections. Once when the child had run,
protesting loudly, with tears raining down his face and his arms
outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been struck in the head
with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father, enraged at
some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family
were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter
grew very skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room
containing a stove, a table, a bureau and some chairs, he would
display strategic ability of a high order, dodging, feinting and
scuttling about among the furniture. He could force three or four
people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to use all
their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was
seldom that they could do him a serious injury or leave any
imprint.</p>

<p>But when the child was present these scenes did not occur. It
came to be recognized that if the dog was molested, the child would
burst into sobs, and as the child, when started, was very riotous
and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a safeguard.</p>

<p>However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he
was asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black
corner a wild, wailful cry, a song of infinite loneliness and
despair, that would go shuddering and sobbing among the buildings
of the block and cause people to swear. At these times the singer
would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with a great
variety of articles.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat the dog, although
it is not known that he ever had what truly could be called a just
cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of
admitted guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a
martyr or to plot revenge. He received the blows with deep
humility, and furthermore he forgave his friend the moment the
child had finished, and was ready to caress the child's hand with
his little red tongue.</p>

<p>When misfortune came upon the child, and his troubles
overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay his
small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever
sympathetic. It is not to be supposed that at such times he took
occasion to refer to the unjust beatings his friend, when provoked,
had administered to him.</p>

<p>He did not achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other
members of the family. He had no confidence in them, and the fear
that he would express at their casual approach often exasperated
them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain satisfaction in
underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to watch
the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often
successful in secret for himself.</p>

<p>So the dog prospered. He developed a large bark, which came
wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl
persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would
utter little yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when
in his dreams he encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him
direfully.</p>

<p>His devotion to the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He
wagged at his approach; he sank down in despair at his departure.
He could detect the sound of the child's step among all the noises
of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.</p>

<p>The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this
terrible potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion
ever lived for an instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in
the mystic, hidden fields of his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of
love and fidelity and perfect faith.</p>

<p>The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to
observe strange things in the vicinity. On these occasions his
friend usually jogged aimfully along behind. Perhaps, though, he
went ahead. This necessitated his turning around every
quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled
with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would
carry himself with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of
so great a monarch.</p>

<p>One day, however, the father of the family got quite
exceptionally drunk. He came home and held carnival with the
cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife. He was in the midst
of this recreation when the child, followed by the dark-brown dog,
entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.</p>

<p>The child's practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He
dived under the table, where experience had taught him was a rather
safe place. The dog, lacking skill in such matters, was, of course,
unaware of the true condition of affairs. He looked with interested
eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to mean: Joyous
gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was
the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.</p>

<p>The head of the family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge
howl of joy, and knocked the dog down with a heavy coffee-pot. The
dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and fear, writhed to his feet
and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a ponderous foot. It
caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide. A second blow of
the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.</p>

<p>Here the child, uttering loud cries, came valiantly forth like a
knight. The father of the family paid no attention to these calls
of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog. Upon being
knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave
up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws
in a peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears
he offered up a small prayer.</p>

<p>But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to
him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the
window. So he reached down and, grabbing the animal by a leg,
lifted him, squirming, up. He swung him two or three times
hilariously about his head, and then flung him with great accuracy
through the window.</p>

<p>The soaring dog created a surprise in the block. A woman
watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary shout and
dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out
to watch the flight of the dog. A woman who had been hanging out
clothes in a yard began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with
clothes-pins, but her arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation. In
appearance she was like a gagged prisoner. Children ran
whooping.</p>

<p>The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the roof of a shed five
stories below. From thence it rolled to the pavement of an
alleyway.</p>

<p>The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirge-like
cry, and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time
to reach the alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs
backward, one step at a time, and holding with both hands to the
step above.</p>

<p>When they came for him later, they found him seated by the body
of his dark-brown friend.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>The Pace of Youth</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Stimson stood in a corner and glowered. He was a fierce man and
had indomitable whiskers, albeit he was very small.</p>

<p>"That young tarrier," he whispered to himself. "He wants to quit
makin' eyes at Lizzie. This is too much of a good thing. First
thing you know, he'll get fired."</p>

<p>His brow creased in a frown, he strode over to the huge open
doors and looked at a sign. "Stimson's Mammoth Merry-Go-Round," it
read, and the glory of it was great. Stimson stood and contemplated
the sign. It was an enormous affair; the letters were as large as
men. The glow of it, the grandeur of it was very apparent to
Stimson. At the end of his contemplation, he shook his head
thoughtfully, determinedly. "No, no," he muttered. "This is too
much of a good thing. First thing you know, he'll get fired."</p>

<p>A soft booming sound of surf, mingled with the cries of bathers,
came from the beach. There was a vista of sand and sky and sea that
drew to a mystic point far away in the northward. In the mighty
angle, a girl in a red dress was crawling slowly like some kind of
a spider on the fabric of nature. A few flags hung lazily above
where the bathhouses were marshalled in compact squares. Upon the
edge of the sea stood a ship with its shadowy sails painted dimly
upon the sky, and high overhead in the still, sun-shot air a great
hawk swung and drifted slowly.</p>

<p>Within the Merry-Go-Round there was a whirling circle of
ornamental lions, giraffes, camels, ponies, goats, glittering with
varnish and metal that caught swift reflections from windows high
above them. With stiff wooden legs, they swept on in a never-ending
race, while a great orchestrion clamored in wild speed. The summer
sunlight sprinkled its gold upon the garnet canopies carried by the
tireless racers and upon all the devices of decoration that made
Stimson's machine magnificent and famous. A host of laughing
children bestrode the animals, bending forward like charging
cavalrymen, and shaking reins and whooping in glee. At intervals
they leaned out perilously to clutch at iron rings that were
tendered to them by a long wooden arm. At the intense moment before
the swift grab for the rings one could see their little nervous
bodies quiver with eagerness; the laughter rang shrill and excited.
Down in the long rows of benches, crowds of people sat watching the
game, while occasionally a father might arise and go near to shout
encouragement, cautionary commands, or applause at his flying
offspring. Frequently mothers called out: "Be careful, Georgie!"
The orchestrion bellowed and thundered on its platform, filling the
ears with its long monotonous song. Over in a corner, a man in a
white apron and behind a counter roared above the tumult: "Popcorn!
Popcorn!"</p>

<p>A young man stood upon a small, raised platform, erected in a
manner of a pulpit, and just without the line of the circling
figures. It was his duty to manipulate the wooden arm and affix the
rings. When all were gone into the hands of the triumphant
children, he held forth a basket, into which they returned all save
the coveted brass one, which meant another ride free and made the
holder very illustrious. The young man stood all day upon his
narrow platform, affixing rings or holding forth the basket. He was
a sort of general squire in these lists of childhood. He was very
busy.</p>

<p>And yet Stimson, the astute, had noticed that the young man
frequently found time to twist about on his platform and smile at a
girl who shyly sold tickets behind a silvered netting. This,
indeed, was the great reason of Stimson's glowering. The young man
upon the raised platform had no manner of license to smile at the
girl behind the silvered netting. It was a most gigantic insolence.
Stimson was amazed at it. "By Jiminy," he said to himself again,
"that fellow is smiling at my daughter." Even in this tone of great
wrath it could be discerned that Stimson was filled with wonder
that any youth should dare smile at the daughter in the presence of
the august father.</p>

<p>Often the dark-eyed girl peered between the shining wires, and,
upon being detected by the young man, she usually turned her head
quickly to prove to him that she was not interested. At other
times, however, her eyes seemed filled with a tender fear lest he
should fall from that exceedingly dangerous platform. As for the
young man, it was plain that these glances filled him with valor,
and he stood carelessly upon his perch, as if he deemed it of no
consequence that he might fall from it. In all the complexities of
his daily life and duties he found opportunity to gaze ardently at
the vision behind the netting.</p>

<p>This silent courtship was conducted over the heads of the crowd
who thronged about the bright machine. The swift eloquent glances
of the young man went noiselessly and unseen with their message.
There had finally become established between the two in this manner
a subtle understanding and companionship. They communicated
accurately all that they felt. The boy told his love, his
reverence, his hope in the changes of the future. The girl told him
that she loved him, and she did not love him, that she did not know
if she loved him. Sometimes a little sign, saying "cashier" in gold
letters, and hanging upon the silvered netting, got directly in
range and interfered with the tender message.</p>

<p>The love affair had not continued without anger, unhappiness,
despair. The girl had once smiled brightly upon a youth who came to
buy some tickets for his little sister, and the young man upon the
platform, observing this smile, had been filled with gloomy rage.
He stood like a dark statue of vengeance upon his pedestal and
thrust out the basket to the children with a gesture that was full
of scorn for their hollow happiness, for their insecure and
temporary joy. For five hours he did not once look at the girl when
she was looking at him. He was going to crush her with his
indifference; he was going to demonstrate that he had never been
serious. However, when he narrowly observed her in secret he
discovered that she seemed more blythe than was usual with her.
When he found that his apparent indifference had not crushed her he
suffered greatly. She did not love him, he concluded. If she had
loved him she would have been crushed. For two days he lived a
miserable existence upon his high perch. He consoled himself by
thinking of how unhappy he was, and by swift, furtive glances at
the loved face. At any rate he was in her presence, and he could
get a good view from his perch when there was no interference by
the little sign: "Cashier."</p>

<p>But suddenly, swiftly, these clouds vanished, and under the
imperial blue sky of the restored confidence they dwelt in peace, a
peace that was satisfaction, a peace that, like a babe, put its
trust in the treachery of the future. This confidence endured until
the next day, when she, for an unknown cause, suddenly refused to
look at him. Mechanically he continued his task, his brain dazed, a
tortured victim of doubt, fear, suspicion. With his eyes he
supplicated her to telegraph an explanation. She replied with a
stony glance that froze his blood. There was a great difference in
their respective reasons for becoming angry. His were always
foolish, but apparent, plain as the moon. Hers were subtle,
feminine, as incomprehensible as the stars, as mysterious as the
shadows at night.</p>

<p>They fell and soared and soared and fell in this manner until
they knew that to live without each other would be a wandering in
deserts. They had grown so intent upon the uncertainties, the
variations, the guessings of their affair that the world had become
but a huge immaterial background. In time of peace their smiles
were soft and prayerful, caresses confided to the air. In time of
war, their youthful hearts, capable of profound agony, were wrung
by the intricate emotions of doubt. They were the victims of the
dread angel of affectionate speculation that forces the brain
endlessly on roads that lead nowhere.</p>

<p>At night, the problem of whether she loved him confronted the
young man like a spectre, looming as high as a hill and telling him
not to delude himself. Upon the following day, this battle of the
night displayed itself in the renewed fervor of his glances and in
their increased number. Whenever he thought he could detect that
she too was suffering, he felt a thrill of joy.</p>

<p>But there came a time when the young man looked back upon these
contortions with contempt. He believed then that he had imagined
his pain. This came about when the redoubtable Stimson marched
forward to participate.</p>

<p>"This has got to stop," Stimson had said to himself, as he stood
and watched them. They had grown careless of the light world that
clattered about them; they were become so engrossed in their
personal drama that the language of their eyes was almost as
obvious as gestures. And Stimson, through his keenness, his
wonderful, infallible penetration, suddenly came into possession of
these obvious facts. "Well, of all the nerves," he said, regarding
with a new interest the young man upon the perch.</p>

<p>He was a resolute man. He never hesitated to grapple with a
crisis. He decided to overturn everything at once, for, although
small, he was very fierce and impetuous. He resolved to crush this
dreaming.</p>

<p>He strode over to the silvered netting. "Say, you want to quit
your everlasting grinning at that idiot," he said, grimly.</p>

<p>The girl cast down her eyes and made a little heap of quarters
into a stack. She was unable to withstand the terrible scrutiny of
her small and fierce father.</p>

<p>Stimson turned from his daughter and went to a spot beneath the
platform. He fixed his eyes upon the young man and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been speakin' to Lizzie. You better attend strictly to
your own business or there'll be a new man here next week." It was
as if he had blazed away with a shotgun. The young man reeled upon
his perch. At last he in a measure regained his composure and
managed to stammer: "A&mdash;all right, sir." He knew that denials
would be futile with the terrible Stimson. He agitatedly began to
rattle the rings in the basket, and pretend that he was obliged to
count them or inspect them in some way. He, too, was unable to face
the great Stimson.</p>

<p>For a moment, Stimson stood in fine satisfaction and gloated
over the effect of his threat.</p>

<p>"I've fixed them," he said complacently, and went out to smoke a
cigar and revel in himself. Through his mind went the proud
reflection that people who came in contact with his granite will
usually ended in quick and abject submission.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>One evening, a week after Stimson had indulged in the proud
reflection that people who came in contact with his granite will
usually ended in quick and abject submission, a young feminine
friend of the girl behind the silvered netting came to her there
and asked her to walk on the beach after "Stimson's Mammoth
Merry-Go-Round" was closed for the night. The girl assented with a
nod.</p>

<p>The young man upon the perch holding the rings saw this nod and
judged its meaning. Into his mind came an idea of defeating the
watchfulness of the redoubtable Stimson. When the Merry-Go-Round
was closed and the two girls started for the beach, he wandered off
aimlessly in another direction, but he kept them in view, and as
soon as he was assured that he had escaped the vigilance of
Stimson, he followed them.</p>

<p>The electric lights on the beach made a broad band of tremoring
light, extending parallel to the sea, and upon the wide walk there
slowly paraded a great crowd, intermingling, intertwining,
sometimes colliding. In the darkness stretched the vast purple
expanse of the ocean, and the deep indigo sky above was peopled
with yellow stars. Occasionally out upon the water a whirling mass
of froth suddenly flashed into view, like a great ghostly robe
appearing, and then vanished, leaving the sea in its darkness,
whence came those bass tones of the water's unknown emotion. A
wind, cool, reminiscent of the wave wastes, made the women hold
their wraps about their throats, and caused the men to grip the
rims of their straw hats. It carried the noise of the band in the
pavilion in gusts. Sometimes people unable to hear the music
glanced up at the pavilion and were reassured upon beholding the
distant leader still gesticulating and bobbing, and the other
members of the band with their lips glued to their instruments.
High in the sky soared an unassuming moon, faintly silver.</p>

<p>For a time the young man was afraid to approach the two girls;
he followed them at a distance and called himself a coward. At
last, however, he saw them stop on the outer edge of the crowd and
stand silently listening to the voices of the sea. When he came to
where they stood, he was trembling in his agitation. They had not
seen him.</p>

<p>"Lizzie," he began. "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl wheeled instantly and put her hand to her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, how you frightened me," she
said&mdash;inevitably.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" he stuttered.</p>

<p>But the other girl was one of those beings who are born to
attend at tragedies. She had for love a reverence, an admiration
that was greater the more that she contemplated the fact that she
knew nothing of it. This couple, with their emotions, awed her and
made her humbly wish that she might be destined to be of some
service to them. She was very homely.</p>

<p>When the young man faltered before them, she, in her sympathy,
actually over-estimated the crisis, and felt that he might fall
dying at their feet. Shyly, but with courage, she marched to the
rescue.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and walk on the beach with us?" she said.</p>

<p>The young man gave her a glance of deep gratitude which was not
without the patronage which a man in his condition naturally feels
for one who pities it. The three walked on.</p>

<p>Finally, the being who was born to attend at this tragedy said
that she wished to sit down and gaze at the sea, alone.</p>

<p>They politely urged her to walk on with them, but she was
obstinate. She wished to gaze at the sea, alone. The young man
swore to himself that he would be her friend until he died.</p>

<p>And so the two young lovers went on without her. They turned
once to look at her.</p>

<p>"Jennie's awful nice," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You bet she is," replied the young man, ardently.</p>

<p>They were silent for a little time.</p>

<p>At last the girl said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You were angry at me yesterday."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Yes, you were, too. You wouldn't look at me once all day."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't angry. I was only putting on."</p>

<p>Though she had, of course, known it, this confession seemed to
make her very indignant. She flashed a resentful glance at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you were, indeed?" she said with a great air.</p>

<p>For a few minutes she was so haughty with him that he loved her
to madness. And directly this poem, which stuck at his lips, came
forth lamely in fragments.</p>

<p>When they walked back toward the other girl and saw the patience
of her attitude, their hearts swelled in a patronizing and
secondary tenderness for her.</p>

<p>They were very happy. If they had been miserable they would have
charged this fairy scene of the night with a criminal
heartlessness; but as they were joyous, they vaguely wondered how
the purple sea, the yellow stars, the changing crowds under the
electric lights could be so phlegmatic and stolid.</p>

<p>They walked home by the lakeside way, and out upon the water
those gay paper lanterns, flashing, fleeting, and careering, sang
to them, sang a chorus of red and violet, and green and gold; a
song of mystic bands of the future.</p>

<p>One day, when business paused during a dull sultry afternoon,
Stimson went up town. Upon his return, he found that the popcorn
man, from his stand over in a corner, was keeping an eye upon the
cashier's cage, and that nobody at all was attending to the wooden
arm and the iron rings. He strode forward like a sergeant of
grenadiers.</p>

<p>"Where in thunder is Lizzie?" he demanded, a cloud of rage in
his eyes.</p>

<p>The popcorn man, although associated long with Stimson, had
never got over being dazed.</p>

<p>"They've&mdash;they've&mdash;gone round to
th'&mdash;th'&mdash;house," he said with difficulty, as if he had
just been stunned.</p>

<p>"Whose house?" snapped Stimson.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;your house, I s'pose," said the popcorn man.</p>

<p>Stimson marched round to his home. Kingly denunciations surged,
already formulated, to the tip of his tongue, and he bided the
moment when his anger could fall upon the heads of that pair of
children. He found his wife convulsive and in tears.</p>

<p>"Where's Lizzie?"</p>

<p>And then she burst
forth&mdash;"Oh&mdash;John&mdash;John&mdash;they've run away, I
know they have. They drove by here not three minutes ago. They must
have done it on purpose to bid me good-bye, for Lizzie waved her
hand sadlike; and then, before I could get out to ask where they
were going or what, Frank whipped up the horse."</p>

<p>Stimson gave vent to a dreadful roar.</p>

<p>"Get my revolver&mdash;get a hack&mdash;get my revolver, do you
hear&mdash;what the devil&mdash;" His voice became incoherent.</p>

<p>He had always ordered his wife about as if she were a battalion
of infantry, and despite her misery, the training of years forced
her to spring mechanically to obey; but suddenly she turned to him
with a shrill appeal.</p>

<p>"Oh, John&mdash;not&mdash;the&mdash;revolver."</p>

<p>"Confound it, let go of me!" he roared again, and shook her from
him.</p>

<p>He ran hatless upon the street. There were a multitude of hacks
at the summer resort, but it was ages to him before he could find
one. Then he charged it like a bull.</p>

<p>"Uptown!" he yelled, as he tumbled into the rear seat.</p>

<p>The hackman thought of severed arteries. His galloping horse
distanced a large number of citizens who had been running to find
what caused such contortions by the little hatless man.</p>

<p>It chanced as the bouncing hack went along near the lake,
Stimson gazed across the calm grey expanse and recognized a color
in a bonnet and a pose of a head. A buggy was traveling along a
highway that led to Sorington. Stimson
bellowed&mdash;"There&mdash;there&mdash;there they are&mdash;in
that buggy."</p>

<p>The hackman became inspired with the full knowledge of the
situation. He struck a delirious blow with the whip. His mouth
expanded in a grin of excitement and joy. It came to pass that this
old vehicle, with its drowsy horse and its dusty-eyed and tranquil
driver, seemed suddenly to awaken, to become animated and fleet.
The horse ceased to ruminate on his state, his air of reflection
vanished. He became intent upon his aged legs and spread them in
quaint and ridiculous devices for speed. The driver, his eyes
shining, sat critically in his seat. He watched each motion of this
rattling machine down before him. He resembled an engineer. He used
the whip with judgment and deliberation as the engineer would have
used coal or oil. The horse clacked swiftly upon the macadam, the
wheels hummed, the body of the vehicle wheezed and groaned.</p>

<p>Stimson, in the rear seat, was erect in that impassive attitude
that comes sometimes to the furious man when he is obliged to leave
the battle to others. Frequently, however, the tempest in his
breast came to his face and he howled&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go it&mdash;go it&mdash;you're gaining; pound 'im! Thump the
life out of 'im; hit 'im hard, you fool!" His hand grasped the rod
that supported the carriage top, and it was clenched so that the
nails were faintly blue.</p>

<p>Ahead, that other carriage had been flying with speed, as from
realization of the menace in the rear. It bowled away rapidly,
drawn by the eager spirit of a young and modern horse. Stimson
could see the buggy-top bobbing, bobbing. That little pane, like an
eye, was a derision to him. Once he leaned forward and bawled angry
sentences. He began to feel impotent; his whole expedition was a
tottering of an old man upon a trail of birds. A sense of age made
him choke again with wrath. That other vehicle, that was youth,
with youth's pace; it was swift-flying with the hope of dreams. He
began to comprehend those two children ahead of him, and he knew a
sudden and strange awe, because he understood the power of their
young blood, the power to fly strongly into the future and feel and
hope again, even at that time when his bones must be laid in the
earth. The dust rose easily from the hot road and stifled the
nostrils of Stimson.</p>

<p>The highway vanished far away in a point with a suggestion of
intolerable length. The other vehicle was becoming so small that
Stimson could no longer see the derisive eye.</p>

<p>At last the hackman drew rein to his horse and turned to look at
Stimson.</p>

<p>"No use, I guess," he said.</p>

<p>Stimson made a gesture of acquiescence, rage, despair. As the
hackman turned his dripping horse about, Stimson sank back with the
astonishment and grief of a man who has been defied by the
universe. He had been in a great perspiration, and now his bald
head felt cool and uncomfortable. He put up his hand with a sudden
recollection that he had forgotten his hat.</p>

<p>At last he made a gesture. It meant that at any rate he was not
responsible.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>A Tent in Agony</h2>

<h3>A SULLIVAN COUNTY TALE</h3>

<p>Four men once came to a wet place in the roadless forest to
fish. They pitched their tent fair upon the brow of a pine-clothed
ridge of riven rocks whence a bowlder could be made to crash
through the brush and whirl past the trees to the lake below. On
fragrant hemlock boughs they slept the sleep of unsuccessful
fishermen, for upon the lake alternately the sun made them lazy and
the rain made them wet. Finally they ate the last bit of bacon and
smoked and burned the last fearful and wonderful hoecake.</p>

<p>Immediately a little man volunteered to stay and hold the camp
while the remaining three should go the Sullivan county miles to a
farmhouse for supplies. They gazed at him dismally. "There's only
one of you&mdash;the devil make a twin," they said in parting
malediction, and disappeared down the hill in the known direction
of a distant cabin. When it came night and the hemlocks began to
sob they had not returned. The little man sat close to his
companion, the campfire, and encouraged it with logs. He puffed
fiercely at a heavy built brier, and regarded a thousand shadows
which were about to assault him. Suddenly he heard the approach of
the unknown, crackling the twigs and rustling the dead leaves. The
little man arose slowly to his feet, his clothes refused to fit his
back, his pipe dropped from his mouth, his knees smote each other.
"Hah!" he bellowed hoarsely in menace. A growl replied and a bear
paced into the light of the fire. The little man supported himself
upon a sapling and regarded his visitor.</p>

<p>The bear was evidently a veteran and a fighter, for the black of
his coat had become tawny with age. There was confidence in his
gait and arrogance in his small, twinkling eye. He rolled back his
lips and disclosed his white teeth. The fire magnified the red of
his mouth. The little man had never before confronted the terrible
and he could not wrest it from his breast. "Hah!" he roared. The
bear interpreted this as the challenge of a gladiator. He
approached warily. As he came near, the boots of fear were suddenly
upon the little man's feet. He cried out and then darted around the
campfire. "Ho!" said the bear to himself, "this thing won't
fight&mdash;it runs. Well, suppose I catch it." So upon his
features there fixed the animal look of going&mdash;somewhere. He
started intensely around the campfire. The little man shrieked and
ran furiously. Twice around they went.</p>

<p>The hand of heaven sometimes falls heavily upon the righteous.
The bear gained.</p>

<p>In desperation the little man flew into the tent. The bear
stopped and sniffed at the entrance. He scented the scent of many
men. Finally he ventured in.</p>

<p>The little man crouched in a distant corner. The bear advanced,
creeping, his blood burning, his hair erect, his jowls dripping.
The little man yelled and rustled clumsily under the flap at the
end of the tent. The bear snarled awfully and made a jump and a
grab at his disappearing game. The little man, now without the
tent, felt a tremendous paw grab his coat tails. He squirmed and
wriggled out of his coat like a schoolboy in the hands of an
avenger. The bear bowled triumphantly and jerked the coat into the
tent and took two bites, a punch and a hug before he, discovered
his man was not in it. Then he grew not very angry, for a bear on a
spree is not a black-haired pirate. He is merely a hoodlum. He lay
down on his back, took the coat on his four paws and began to play
uproariously with it. The most appalling, blood-curdling whoops and
yells came to where the little man was crying in a treetop and
froze his blood. He moaned a little speech meant for a prayer and
clung convulsively to the bending branches. He gazed with tearful
wistfulness at where his comrade, the campfire, was giving dying
flickers and crackles. Finally, there was a roar from the tent
which eclipsed all roars; a snarl which it seemed would shake the
stolid silence of the mountain and cause it to shrug its granite
shoulders. The little man quaked and shrivelled to a grip and a
pair of eyes. In the glow of the embers he saw the white tent
quiver and fall with a crash. The bear's merry play had disturbed
the center pole and brought a chaos of canvas upon his head.</p>

<p>Now the little man became the witness of a mighty scene. The
tent began to flounder. It took flopping strides in the direction
of the lake. Marvellous sounds came from within&mdash;rips and
tears, and great groans and pants. The little man went into
giggling hysterics.</p>

<p>The entangled monster failed to extricate himself before he had
walloped the tent frenziedly to the edge of the mountain. So it
came to pass that three men, clambering up the hill with bundles
and baskets, saw their tent approaching. It seemed to them like a
white-robed phantom pursued by hornets. Its moans riffled the
hemlock twigs.</p>

<p>The three men dropped their bundles and scurried to one side,
their eyes gleaming with fear. The canvas avalanche swept past
them. They leaned, faint and dumb, against trees and listened,
their blood stagnant. Below them it struck the base of a great pine
tree, where it writhed and struggled. The three watched its
convolutions a moment and then started terrifically for the top of
the hill. As they disappeared, the bear cut loose with a mighty
effort. He cast one dishevelled and agonized look at the white
thing, and then started wildly for the inner recesses of the
forest.</p>

<p>The three fear-stricken individuals ran to the rebuilt fire. The
little man reposed by it calmly smoking. They sprang at him and
overwhelmed him with interrogations. He contemplated darkness and
took a long, pompous puff. "There's only one of me&mdash;and the
devil made a twin," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Four Men in a Cave</h2>

<h3>Likewise Four Queens, and a Sullivan County Hermit</h3>

<p>The moon rested for a moment on the top of a tall pine on a
hill.</p>

<p>The little man was standing in front of the campfire making
orations to his companions.</p>

<p>"We can tell a great tale when we get back to the city if we
investigate this thing," said he, in conclusion.</p>

<p>They were won.</p>

<p>The little man was determined to explore a cave, because its
black mouth had gaped at him. The four men took a lighted pine-knot
and clambered over boulders down a hill. In a thicket on the
mountainside lay a little tilted hole. At its side they halted.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the little man.</p>

<p>They fought for last place and the little man was overwhelmed.
He tried to struggle from under by crying that if the fat, pudgy
man came after, he would be corked. But he finally administered a
cursing over his shoulder and crawled into the hole. His companions
gingerly followed.</p>

<p>A passage, the floor of damp clay and pebbles, the walls slimy,
green-mossed, and dripping, sloped downward. In the cave atmosphere
the torches became studies in red blaze and black smoke.</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried the little man, stifled and bedraggled, "let's go
back." His companions were not brave. They were last. The next one
to the little man pushed him on, so the little man said sulphurous
words and cautiously continued his crawl.</p>

<p>Things that hung seemed to be on the wet, uneven ceiling, ready
to drop upon the men's bare necks. Under their hands the clammy
floor seemed alive and writhing. When the little man endeavored to
stand erect the ceiling forced him down. Knobs and points came out
and punched him. His clothes were wet and mud-covered, and his
eyes, nearly blinded by smoke, tried to pierce the darkness always
before his torch.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, you fellows, let's go back," cried he. At that
moment he caught the gleam of trembling light in the blurred
shadows before him.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he said, "here's another way out."</p>

<p>The passage turned abruptly. The little man put one hand around
the corner, but it touched nothing. He investigated and discovered
that the little corridor took a sudden dip down a hill. At the
bottom shone a yellow light.</p>

<p>The little man wriggled painfully about, and descended feet in
advance. The others followed his plan. All picked their way with
anxious care. The traitorous rocks rolled from beneath the little
man's feet and roared thunderously below him, lesser stone loosened
by the men above him, hit him on the back. He gained seemingly firm
foothold, and, turning halfway about, swore redly at his companions
for dolts and careless fools. The pudgy man sat, puffing and
perspiring, high in the rear of the procession. The fumes and smoke
from four pine-knots were in his blood. Cinders and sparks lay
thick in his eyes and hair. The pause of the little man angered
him.</p>

<p>"Go on, you fool!" he shouted. "Poor, painted man, you are
afraid."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said the little man. "Come down here and go on yourself,
imbecile!"</p>

<p>The pudgy man vibrated with passion. He leaned downward.
"Idiot&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by one of his feet which flew out and crashed
into the man in front of and below. It is not well to quarrel upon
a slippery incline, when the unknown is below. The fat man, having
lost the support of one pillar-like foot, lurched forward. His body
smote the next man, who hurtled into the next man. Then they all
fell upon the cursing little man.</p>

<p>They slid in a body down over the slippery, slimy floor of the
passage. The stone avenue must have wibble-wobbled with the rush of
this ball of tangled men and strangled cries. The torches went out
with the combined assault upon the little man. The adventurers
whirled to the unknown in darkness. The little man felt that he was
pitching to death, but even in his convolutions he bit and
scratched at his companions, for he was satisfied that it was their
fault. The swirling mass went some twenty feet, and lit upon a
level, dry place in a strong, yellow light of candles. It dissolved
and became eyes.</p>

<p>The four men lay in a heap upon the floor of a grey chamber. A
small fire smoldered in the corner, the smoke disappearing in a
crack. In another corner was a bed of faded hemlock boughs and two
blankets. Cooking utensils and clothes lay about, with boxes and a
barrel.</p>

<p>Of these things the four men took small cognisance. The pudgy
man did not curse the little man, nor did the little man swear, in
the abstract. Eight widened eyes were fixed upon the center of the
room of rocks.</p>

<p>A great, gray stone, cut squarely, like an altar, sat in the
middle of the floor. Over it burned three candles, in swaying tin
cups hung from the ceiling. Before it, with what seemed to be a
small volume clasped in his yellow fingers, stood a man. He was an
infinitely sallow person in the brown-checked shirt of the ploughs
and cows. The rest of his apparel was boots. A long grey beard
dangled from his chin. He fixed glinting, fiery eyes upon the heap
of men, and remained motionless. Fascinated, their tongues
cleaving, their blood cold, they arose to their feet. The gleaming
glance of the recluse swept slowly over the group until it found
the face of the little man. There it stayed and burned.</p>

<p>The little man shrivelled and crumpled as the dried leaf under
the glass.</p>

<p>Finally, the recluse slowly, deeply spoke. It was a true voice
from a cave, cold, solemn, and damp.</p>

<p>"It's your ante," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" said the little man.</p>

<p>The hermit tilted his beard and laughed a laugh that was either
the chatter of a banshee in a storm or the rattle of pebbles in a
tin box. His visitors' flesh seemed ready to drop from their
bones.</p>

<p>They huddled together and cast fearful eyes over their
shoulders. They whispered.</p>

<p>"A vampire!" said one.</p>

<p>"A ghoul!" said another.</p>

<p>"A Druid before the sacrifice," murmured another.</p>

<p>"The shade of an Aztec witch doctor," said the little man.</p>

<p>As they looked, the inscrutable face underwent a change. It
became a livid background for his eyes, which blazed at the little
man like impassioned carbuncles. His voice arose to a howl of
ferocity. "It's your ante!" With a panther-like motion he drew a
long, thin knife and advanced, stooping. Two cadaverous hounds came
from nowhere, and, scowling and growling, made desperate feints at
the little man's legs. His quaking companions pushed him
forward.</p>

<p>Tremblingly he put his hand to his pocket.</p>

<p>"How much?" he said, with a shivering look at the knife that
glittered.</p>

<p>The carbuncles faded.</p>

<p>"Three dollars," said the hermit, in sepulchral tones which rang
against the walls and among the passages, awakening long-dead
spirits with voices. The shaking little man took a roll of bills
from a pocket and placed "three ones" upon the altar-like stone.
The recluse looked at the little volume with reverence in his eyes.
It was a pack of playing cards.</p>

<p>Under the three swinging candles, upon the altar-like stone, the
grey beard and the agonized little man played at poker. The three
other men crouched in a corner, and stared with eyes that gleamed
with terror. Before them sat the cadaverous hounds licking their
red lips. The candles burned low, and began to flicker. The fire in
the corner expired.</p>

<p>Finally, the game came to a point where the little man laid down
his hand and quavered: "I can't call you this time, sir. I'm dead
broke."</p>

<p>"What?" shrieked the recluse. "Not call me! Villain Dastard!
Cur! I have four queens, miscreant." His voice grew so mighty that
it could not fit his throat. He choked wrestling with his lungs for
a moment. Then the power of his body was concentrated in a word:
"Go!"</p>

<p>He pointed a quivering, yellow finger at a wide crack in the
rock. The little man threw himself at it with a howl. His erstwhile
frozen companions felt their blood throb again. With great bounds
they plunged after the little man. A minute of scrambling, falling,
and pushing brought them to open air. They climbed the distance to
their camp in furious springs.</p>

<p>The sky in the east was a lurid yellow. In the west the
footprints of departing night lay on the pine trees. In front of
their replenished camp fire sat John Willerkins, the guide.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he shouted at their approach. "Be you fellers ready to
go deer huntin'?"</p>

<p>Without replying, they stopped and debated among themselves in
whispers.</p>

<p>Finally, the pudgy man came forward.</p>

<p>"John," he inquired, "do you know anything peculiar about this
cave below here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Willerkins at once; "Tom Gardner."</p>

<p>"What?" said the pudgy man.</p>

<p>"Tom Gardner."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Willerkins slowly, as he took dignified
pulls at his pipe, "Tom Gardner was once a fambly man, who lived in
these here parts on a nice leetle farm. He uster go away to the
city orften, and one time he got a-gamblin' in one of them there
dens. He went ter the dickens right quick then. At last he kum home
one time and tol' his folks he had up and sold the farm and all he
had in the worl'. His leetle wife she died then. Tom he went crazy,
and soon after&mdash;"</p>

<p>The narrative was interrupted by the little man, who became
possessed of devils.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give a cuss if he had left me 'nough money to get
home on the doggoned, grey-haired red pirate," he shrilled, in a
seething sentence. The pudgy man gazed at the little man calmly and
sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "we can tell a great tale when we get back
to the city after having investigated this thing."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," replied the little man.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>The Mesmeric Mountain</h2>

<h3>A Tale of Sullivan County</h3>

<p>On the brow of a pine-plumed hillock there sat a little man with
his back against a tree. A venerable pipe hung from his mouth, and
smoke-wreaths curled slowly skyward, he was muttering to himself
with his eyes fixed on an irregular black opening in the green wall
of forest at the foot of the hill. Two vague wagon ruts led into
the shadows. The little man took his pipe in his hands and
addressed the listening pines.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the devil it leads to," said he.</p>

<p>A grey, fat rabbit came lazily from a thicket and sat in the
opening. Softly stroking his stomach with his paw, he looked at the
little man in a thoughtful manner. The little man threw a stone,
and the rabbit blinked and ran through an opening. Green, shadowy
portals seemed to close behind him.</p>

<p>The little man started. "He's gone down that roadway," he said,
with ecstatic mystery to the pines. He sat a long time and
contemplated the door to the forest. Finally, he arose, and
awakening his limbs, started away. But he stopped and looked
back.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what it leads to," muttered he. He trudged over
the brown mats of pine needles, to where, in a fringe of laurel, a
tent was pitched, and merry flames caroused about some logs. A
pudgy man was fuming over a collection of tin dishes. He came
forward and waved a plate furiously in the little man's face.</p>

<p>"I've washed the dishes for three days. What do you think I
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ended a red oration with a roar: "Damned if I do it any
more."</p>

<p>The little man gazed dim-eyed away. "I've been wonderin' what it
leads to."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That road out yonder. I've been wonderin' what it leads to.
Maybe, some discovery or something," said the little man.</p>

<p>The pudgy man laughed. "You're an idiot. It leads to ol' Jim
Boyd's over on the Lumberland Pike."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said the little man, "I don't believe that."</p>

<p>The pudgy man swore. "Fool, what does it lead to, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know just what, but I'm sure it leads to something
great or something. It looks like it."</p>

<p>While the pudgy man was cursing, two more men came from
obscurity with fish dangling from birch twigs. The pudgy man made
an obviously herculean struggle and a meal was prepared. As he was
drinking his cup of coffee, he suddenly spilled it and swore. The
little man was wandering off.</p>

<p>"He's gone to look at that hole," cried the pudgy man.</p>

<p>The little man went to the edge of the pine-plumed hillock, and,
sitting down, began to make smoke and regard the door to the
forest. There was stillness for an hour. Compact clouds hung
unstirred in the sky. The pines stood motionless, and
pondering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little man slapped his knees and bit his tongue. He
stood up and determinedly filled his pipe, rolling his eye over the
bowl to the doorway. Keeping his eyes fixed he slid dangerously to
the foot of the hillock and walked down the wagon ruts. A moment
later he passed from the noise of the sunshine to the gloom of the
woods.</p>

<p>The green portals closed, shutting out live things. The little
man trudged on alone.</p>

<p>Tall tangled grass grew in the roadway, and the trees bended
obstructing branches. The little man followed on over pine-clothed
ridges and down through water-soaked swales. His shoes were cut by
rocks of the mountains, and he sank ankle-deep in mud and moss of
swamps. A curve just ahead lured him miles.</p>

<p>Finally, as he wended the side of a ridge, the road disappeared
from beneath his feet. He battled with hordes of ignorant bushes on
his way to knolls and solitary trees which invited him. Once he
came to a tall, bearded pine. He climbed it, and perceived in the
distance a peak. He uttered an ejaculation and fell out.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, and said: "That's Jones's Mountain, I
guess. It's about six miles from our camp as the crow flies."</p>

<p>He changed his course away from the mountain, and attacked the
bushes again. He climbed over great logs, golden-brown in decay,
and was opposed by thickets of dark-green laurel. A brook slid
through the ooze of a swamp, cedars and hemlocks hung their spray
to the edges of pools.</p>

<p>The little man began to stagger in his walk. After a time he
stopped and mopped his brow.</p>

<p>"My legs are about to shrivel up and drop off," he said..."Still
if I keep on in this direction, I am safe to strike the Lumberland
Pike before sundown."</p>

<p>He dived at a clump of tag-alders, and emerging, confronted
Jones's Mountain.</p>

<p>The wanderer sat down in a clear space and fixed his eyes on the
summit. His mouth opened widely, and his body swayed at times. The
little man and the peak stared in silence.</p>

<p>A lazy lake lay asleep near the foot of the mountain. In its bed
of water-grass some frogs leered at the sky and crooned. The sun
sank in red silence, and the shadows of the pines grew formidable.
The expectant hush of evening, as if some thing were going to sing
a hymn, fell upon the peak and the little man.</p>

<p>A leaping pickerel off on the water created a silver circle that
was lost in black shadows. The little man shook himself and started
to his feet, crying: "For the love of Mike, there's eyes in this
mountain! I feel 'em! Eyes!"</p>

<p>He fell on his face.</p>

<p>When he looked again, he immediately sprang erect and ran.</p>

<p>"It's comin'!"</p>

<p>The mountain was approaching.</p>

<p>The little man scurried, sobbing through the thick growth. He
felt his brain turning to water. He vanquished brambles with mighty
bounds.</p>

<p>But after a time he came again to the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>"God!" he howled, "it's been follerin' me." He grovelled.</p>

<p>Casting his eyes upward made circles swirl in his blood.</p>

<p>"I'm shackled I guess," he moaned. As he felt the heel of the
mountain about to crush his head, he sprang again to his feet. He
grasped a handful of small stones and hurled them.</p>

<p>"Damn you," he shrieked loudly. The pebbles rang against the
face of the mountain.</p>

<p>The little man then made an attack. He climbed with hands and
feet wildly. Brambles forced him back and stones slid from beneath
his feet. The peak swayed and tottered, and was ever about to smite
with a granite arm. The summit was a blaze of red wrath.</p>

<p>But the little man at last reached the top. Immediately he
swaggered with valor to the edge of the cliff. His hands were
scornfully in his pockets.</p>

<p>He gazed at the western horizon, edged sharply against a yellow
sky.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he said. "There's Boyd's house and the Lumberland
Pike."</p>

<p>The mountain under his feet was motionless.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>The Snake</h2>

<p>Where the path wended across the ridge, the bushes of
huckleberry and sweet fern swarmed at it in two curling waves until
it was a mere winding line traced through a tangle. There was no
interference by clouds, and as the rays of the sun fell full upon
the ridge, they called into voice innumerable insects which chanted
the heat of the summer day in steady, throbbing, unending
chorus.</p>

<p>A man and a dog came from the laurel thickets of the valley
where the white brook brawled with the rocks. They followed the
deep line of the path across the ridges. The dog&mdash;a large
lemon and white setter&mdash;walked, tranquilly meditative, at his
master's heels.</p>

<p>Suddenly from some unknown and yet near place in advance there
came a dry, shrill whistling rattle that smote motion instantly
from the limbs of the man and the dog. Like the fingers of a sudden
death, this sound seemed to touch the man at the nape of the neck,
at the top of the spine, and change him, as swift as thought, to a
statue of listening horror, surprise, rage. The dog, too&mdash;the
same icy hand was laid upon him, and he stood crouched and
quivering, his jaw dropping, the froth of terror upon his lips, the
light of hatred in his eyes.</p>

<p>Slowly the man moved his hands toward the bushes, but his glance
did not turn from the place made sinister by the warning rattle.
His fingers, unguided, sought for a stick of weight and strength.
Presently they closed about one that seemed adequate, and holding
this weapon poised before him the man moved slowly forward,
glaring. The dog with his nervous nostrils fairly fluttering moved
warily, one foot at a time, after his master.</p>

<p>But when the man came upon the snake, his body underwent a shock
as if from a revelation, as if after all he had been ambushed. With
a blanched face, he sprang forward and his breath came in strained
gasps, his chest heaving as if he were in the performance of an
extraordinary muscular trial. His arm with the stick made a
spasmodic, defensive gesture.</p>

<p>The snake had apparently been crossing the path in some mystic
travel when to his sense there came the knowledge of the coming of
his foes. The dull vibration perhaps informed him, and he flung his
body to face the danger. He had no knowledge of paths; he had no
wit to tell him to slink noiselessly into the bushes. He knew that
his implacable enemies were approaching; no doubt they were seeking
him, hunting him. And so he cried his cry, an incredibly swift
jangle of tiny bells, as burdened with pathos as the hammering upon
quaint cymbals by the Chinese at war&mdash;for, indeed, it was
usually his death-music.</p>

<p>"Beware! Beware! Beware!"</p>

<p>The man and the snake confronted each other. In the man's eyes
were hatred and fear. In the snake's eyes were hatred and fear.
These enemies maneuvered, each preparing to kill. It was to be a
battle without mercy. Neither knew of mercy for such a situation.
In the man was all the wild strength of the terror of his
ancestors, of his race, of his kind. A deadly repulsion had been
handed from man to man through long dim centuries. This was another
detail of a war that had begun evidently when first there were men
and snakes. Individuals who do not participate in this strife incur
the investigations of scientists. Once there was a man and a snake
who were friends, and at the end, the man lay dead with the marks
of the snake's caress just over his East Indian heart. In the
formation of devices, hideous and horrible, Nature reached her
supreme point in the making of the snake, so that priests who
really paint hell well fill it with snakes instead of fire. The
curving forms, these scintillant coloring create at once, upon
sight, more relentless animosities than do shake barbaric tribes.
To be born a snake is to be thrust into a place a-swarm with
formidable foes. To gain an appreciation of it, view hell as
pictured by priests who are really skilful.</p>

<p>As for this snake in the pathway, there was a double curve some
inches back of its head, which, merely by the potency of its lines,
made the man feel with tenfold eloquence the touch of the
death-fingers at the nape of his neck. The reptile's head was
waving slowly from side to side and its hot eyes flashed like
little murder-lights. Always in the air was the dry, shrill
whistling of the rattles.</p>

<p>"Beware! Beware! Beware!"</p>

<p>The man made a preliminary feint with his stick. Instantly the
snake's heavy head and neck were bended back on the double curve
and instantly the snake's body shot forward in a low, strait, hard
spring. The man jumped with a convulsive chatter and swung his
stick. The blind, sweeping blow fell upon the snake's head and
hurled him so that steel-colored plates were for a moment
uppermost. But he rallied swiftly, agilely, and again the head and
neck bended back to the double curve, and the steaming, wide-open
mouth made its desperate effort to reach its enemy. This attack, it
could be seen, was despairing, but it was nevertheless impetuous,
gallant, ferocious, of the same quality as the charge of the lone
chief when the walls of white faces close upon him in the
mountains. The stick swung unerringly again, and the snake,
mutilated, torn, whirled himself into the last coil.</p>

<p>And now the man went sheer raving mad from the emotions of his
forefathers and from his own. He came to close quarters. He gripped
the stick with his two hands and made it speed like a flail. The
snake, tumbling in the anguish of final despair, fought, bit, flung
itself upon this stick which was taking his life.</p>

<p>At the end, the man clutched his stick and stood watching in
silence. The dog came slowly and with infinite caution stretched
his nose forward, sniffing. The hair upon his neck and back moved
and ruffled as if a sharp wind was blowing, the last muscular
quivers of the snake were causing the rattles to still sound their
treble cry, the shrill, ringing war chant and hymn of the grave of
the thing that faces foes at once countless, implacable, and
superior.</p>

<p>"Well, Rover," said the man, turning to the dog with a grin of
victory, "we'll carry Mr. Snake home to show the girls."</p>

<p>His hands still trembled from the strain of the encounter, but
he pried with his stick under the body of the snake and hoisted the
limp thing upon it. He resumed his march along the path, and the
dog walked tranquilly meditative, at his master's heels.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>London Impressions</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>London at first consisted of a porter with the most charming
manners in the world, and a cabman with a supreme intelligence,
both observing my profound ignorance without contempt or humor of
any kind observable in their manners. It was in a great resounding
vault of a place where there were many people who had come home,
and I was displeased because they knew the detail of the business,
whereas I was confronting the inscrutable. This made them appear
very stony-hearted to the sufferings of one of whose existence, to
be sure, they were entirely unaware, and I remember taking great
pleasure in disliking them heartily for it. I was in an agony of
mind over my baggage, or my luggage, or my&mdash;perhaps it is well
to shy around this terrible international question; but I remember
that when I was a lad I was told that there was a whole nation that
said luggage instead of baggage, and my boyish mind was filled at
the time with incredulity and scorn. In the present case it was a
thing that I understood to involve the most hideous confessions of
imbecility on my part, because I had evidently to go out to some
obscure point and espy it and claim it, and take trouble for it;
and I would rather have had my pockets filled with bread and
cheese, and had no baggage at all.</p>

<p>Mind you, this was not at all a homage that I was paying to
London. I was paying homage to a new game. A man properly lazy does
not like new experiences until they become old ones. Moreover, I
have been taught that a man, any man, who has a thousand times more
points of information on a certain thing than I have will bully me
because of it, and pour his advantages upon my bowed head until I
am drenched with his superiority. It was in my education to concede
some license of the kind in this case, but the holy father of a
porter and the saintly cabman occupied the middle distance
imperturbably, and did not come down from their hills to clout me
with knowledge. From this fact I experienced a criminal elation. I
lost view of the idea that if I had been brow-beaten by porters and
cabmen from one end of the United States to the other end I should
warmly like it, because in numbers they are superior to me, and
collectively they can have a great deal of fun out of a matter that
would merely afford me the glee of the latent butcher.</p>

<p>This London, composed of a porter and a cabman, stood to me
subtly as a benefactor. I had scanned the drama, and found that I
did not believe that the mood of the men emanated unduly from the
feature that there was probably more shillings to the square inch
of me than there were shillings to the square inch of them. Nor yet
was it any manner of palpable warm-heartedness or other natural
virtue. But it was a perfect artificial virtue; it was drill,
plain, simple drill. And now was I glad of their drilling, and
vividly approved of it, because I saw that it was good for me.
Whether it was good or bad for the porter and the cabman I could
not know; but that point, mark you, came within the pale of my
respectable rumination.</p>

<p>I am sure that it would have been more correct for me to have
alighted upon St. Paul's and described no emotion until I was
overcome by the Thames Embankment and the Houses of Parliament. But
as a matter of fact I did not see them for some days, and at this
time they did not concern me at all. I was born in London at a
railroad station, and my new vision encompassed a porter and a
cabman. They deeply absorbed me in new phenomena, and I did not
then care to see the Thames Embankment nor the Houses of
Parliament. I considered the porter and the cabman to be more
important.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>The cab finally rolled out of the gas-lit vault into a vast
expanse of gloom. This changed to the shadowy lines of a street
that was like a passage in a monstrous cave. The lamps winking here
and there resembled the little gleams at the caps of the miners.
They were not very competent illuminations at best, merely being
little pale flares of gas that at their most heroic periods could
only display one fact concerning this tunnel&mdash;the fact of
general direction. But at any rate I should have liked to have
observed the dejection of a search-light if it had been called upon
to attempt to bore through this atmosphere. In it each man sat in
his own little cylinder of vision, so to speak. It was not so small
as a sentry-box nor so large as a circus tent, but the walls were
opaque, and what was passing beyond the dimensions of his cylinder
no man knew.</p>

<p>It was evident that the paving was very greasy, but all the cabs
that passed through my cylinder were going at a round trot, while
the wheels, shod in rubber, whirred merely like bicycles. The hoofs
of the animals themselves did not make that wild clatter which I
knew so well. New York in fact, roars always like ten thousand
devils. We have ingenuous and simple ways of making a din in New
York that cause the stranger to conclude that each citizen is
obliged by statute to provide himself with a pair of cymbals and a
drum. If anything by chance can be turned into a noise it is
promptly turned. We are engaged in the development of a human
creature with very large, sturdy, and doubly, fortified ears.</p>

<p>It was not too late at night, but this London moved with the
decorum and caution of an undertaker. There was a silence, and yet
there was no silence. There was a low drone, perhaps a humming
contributed inevitably by closely-gathered thousands, and yet on
second thoughts it was to me silence. I had perched my ears for the
note of London, the sound made simply by the existence of five
million people in one place. I had imagined something deep, vastly
deep, a bass from a mythical organ, but found as far as I was
concerned, only a silence.</p>

<p>New York in numbers is a mighty city, and all day and all night
it cries its loud, fierce, aspiring cry, a noise of men beating
upon barrels, a noise of men beating upon tin, a terrific racket
that assails the abject skies. No one of us seemed to question this
row as a certain consequence of three or four million people living
together and scuffling for coin, with more agility, perhaps, but
otherwise in the usual way. However, after this easy silence of
London, which in numbers is a mightier city, I began to feel that
there was a seduction in this idea of necessity. Our noise in New
York was not a consequence of our rapidity at all. It was a
consequence of our bad pavements.</p>

<p>Any brigade of artillery in Europe that would love to assemble
its batteries, and then go on a gallop over the land, thundering
and thundering, would give up the idea of thunder at once if it
could hear Tim Mulligan drive a beer wagon along one of the side
streets of cobbled New York.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Finally a great thing came to pass. The cab horse, proceeding at
a sharp trot, found himself suddenly at the top of an incline,
where through the rain the pavement shone like an expanse of ice.
It looked to me as if there was going to be a tumble. In an
accident of such a kind a hansom becomes really a cannon in which a
man finds that he has paid shillings for the privilege of serving
as a projectile. I was making a rapid calculation of the arc that I
would describe in my flight, when the horse met his crisis with a
masterly device that I could not have imagined. He tranquilly
braced his four feet like a bundle of stakes, and then, with a
gentle gaiety of demeanor, he slid swiftly and gracefully to the
bottom of the hill as if he had been a toboggan. When the incline
ended he caught his gait again with great dexterity, and went
pattering off through another tunnel.</p>

<p>I at once looked upon myself as being singularly blessed by this
sight. This horse had evidently originated this system of skating
as a diversion, or, more probably, as a precaution against the
slippery pavement; and he was, of course the inventor and sole
proprietor&mdash;two terms that are not always in conjunction. It
surely was not to be supposed that there could be two skaters like
him in the world. He deserved to be known and publicly praised for
this accomplishment. It was worthy of many records and exhibitions.
But when the cab arrived at a place where some dipping streets met,
and the flaming front of a music-hall temporarily widened my
cylinder, behold there were many cabs, and as the moment of
necessity came the horses were all skaters. They were gliding in
all directions. It might have been a rink. A great omnibus was
hailed by a hand under an umbrella on the side walk, and the
dignified horses bidden to halt from their trot did not waste time
in wild and unseemly spasms. They, too, braced their legs and slid
gravely to the end of their momentum.</p>

<p>It was not the feat, but it was the word which had at this time
the power to conjure memories of skating parties on moonlit lakes,
with laughter ringing over the ice, and a great red bonfire on the
shore among the hemlocks.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>A Terrible thing in nature is the fall of a horse in his
harness. It is a tragedy. Despite their skill in skating there was
that about the pavement on the rainy evening which filled me with
expectations of horses going headlong. Finally it happened just in
front. There was a shout and a tangle in the darkness, and
presently a prostrate cab horse came within my cylinder. The
accident having been a complete success and altogether concluded, a
voice from the side walk said, "<i>Look</i> out, now! <i>Be</i>
more careful, can't you?"</p>

<p>I remember a constituent of a Congressman at Washington who had
tried in vain to bore this Congressman with a wild project of some
kind. The Congressman eluded him with skill, and his rage and
despair ultimately culminated in the supreme grievance that he
could not even get near enough to the Congressman to tell him to go
to Hades.</p>

<p>This cabman should have felt the same desire to strangle this
man who spoke from the sidewalk. He was plainly impotent; he was
deprived of the power of looking out. There was nothing now for
which to look out. The man on the sidewalk had dragged a corpse
from a pond and said to it,</p>

<p>"<i>Be</i> more careful, can't you, or you'll drown?" My cabman
pulled up and addressed a few words of reproach to the other. Three
or four figures loomed into my cylinder, and as they appeared spoke
to the author or the victim of the calamity in varied terms of
displeasure. Each of these reproaches was couched in terms that
defined the situation as impending. No blind man could have
conceived that the precipitate phrase of the incident was
absolutely closed.</p>

<p>"<i>Look</i> out now, cawn't you?" And there was nothing in his
mind which approached these sentiments near enough to tell them to
go to Hades.</p>

<p>However, it needed only an ear to know presently that these
expressions were formulae. It was merely the obligatory dance which
the Indians had to perform before they went to war. These men had
come to help, but as a regular and traditional preliminary they had
first to display to this cabman their idea of his ignominy.</p>

<p>The different thing in the affair was the silence of the victim.
He retorted never a word. This, too, to me seemed to be an
obedience to a recognized form. He was the visible criminal, if
there was a criminal, and there was born of it a privilege for
them.</p>

<p>They unfastened the proper straps and hauled back the cab. They
fetched a mat from some obscure place of succor, and pushed it
carefully under the prostrate thing. From this panting, quivering
mass they suddenly and emphatically reconstructed a horse. As each
man turned to go his way he delivered some superior caution to the
cabman while the latter buckled his harness.</p>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>There was to be noticed in this band of rescuers a young man in
evening clothes and top-hat. Now, in America a young man in evening
clothes and a top-hat may be a terrible object. He is not likely to
do violence, but he is likely to do impassivity and indifference to
the point where they become worse than violence. There are certain
of the more idle phases of civilization to which America has not
yet awakened&mdash;and it is a matter of no moment if she remains
unaware. This matter of hats is one of them. I recall a legend
recited to me by an esteemed friend, ex-Sheriff of Tin Can, Nevada.
Jim Cortright, one of the best gun-fighters in town, went on a
journey to Chicago, and while there he procured a top-hat. He was
quite sure how Tin Can would accept this innovation, but he relied
on the celerity with which he could get a six-shooter in action.
One Sunday Jim examined his guns with his usual care, placed the
top-hat on the back of his head, and sauntered coolly out into the
streets of Tin Can.</p>

<p>Now, while Jim was in Chicago some progressive citizen had
decided that Tin Can needed a bowling alley. The carpenters went to
work the next morning, and an order for the balls and pins was
telegraphed to Denver. In three days the whole population was
concentrated at the new alley betting their outfits and their
lives.</p>

<p>It has since been accounted very unfortunate that Jim Cortright
had not learned of bowling alleys at his mother's knee or even
later in the mines. This portion of his mind was singularly
belated. He might have been an Apache for all he knew of bowling
alleys.</p>

<p>In his careless stroll through the town, his hands not far from
his belt and his eyes going sideways in order to see who would
shoot first at the hat, he came upon this long, low shanty where
Tin Can was betting itself hoarse over a game between a team from
the ranks of Excelsior Hose Company No. 1 and a team composed from
the <i>habitues</i> of the "Red Light" saloon.</p>

<p>Jim, in blank ignorance of bowling phenomena, wandered casually
through a little door into what must always be termed the wrong end
of a bowling alley. Of course, he saw that the supreme moment had
come. They were not only shooting at the hat and at him, but the
low-down cusses were using the most extraordinary and hellish
ammunition. Still, perfectly undaunted, however, Jim retorted with
his two Colts, and killed three of the best bowlers in Tin Can.</p>

<p>The ex-Sheriff vouched for this story. He himself had gone
headlong through the door at the firing of the first shot with that
simple courtesy which leads Western men to donate the fighters
plenty of room. He said that afterwards the hat was the cause of a
number of other fights, and that finally a delegation of prominent
citizens was obliged to wait upon Cortright and ask him if he
wouldn't take that thing away somewhere and bury it. Jim pointed
out to them that it was his hat, and that he would regard it as a
cowardly concession if he submitted to their dictation in the
matter of his headgear. He added that he purposed to continue to
wear his top-hat on every occasion when he happened to feel that
the wearing of a top-hat was a joy and a solace to him.</p>

<p>The delegation sadly retired, and announced to the town that Jim
Cortright had openly defied them, and had declared his purpose of
forcing his top-hat on the pained attention of Tin Can whenever he
chose. Jim Cortright's plug hat became a phrase with considerable
meaning to it.</p>

<p>However, the whole affair ended in a great passionate outburst
of popular revolution. Spike Foster was a friend of Cortright, and
one day, when the latter was indisposed, Spike came to him and
borrowed the hat. He had been drinking heavily at the "Red Light,"
and was in a supremely reckless mood. With the terrible gear
hanging jauntily over his eye and his two guns drawn, he walked
straight out into the middle of the square in front of the Palace
Hotel, and drew the attention of all Tin Can by a blood-curdling
imitation of the yowl of a mountain lion.</p>

<p>This was when the long suffering populace arose as one man. The
top-hat had been flaunted once too often. When Spike Foster's
friends came to carry him away they found nearly a hundred and
fifty men shooting busily at a mark&mdash;and the mark was the
hat.</p>

<p>My informant told me that he believed he owed his popularity in
Tin Can, and subsequently his election to the distinguished office
of Sheriff, to the active and prominent part he had taken in the
proceedings.</p>

<p>The enmity to the top-hat expressed by the convincing anecdote
exists in the American West at present, I think, in the perfection
of its strength; but disapproval is not now displayed by volleys
from the citizens, save in the most aggravating cases. It is at
present usually a matter of mere jibe and general contempt. The
East, however, despite a great deal of kicking and gouging, is
having the top-hat stuffed slowly and carefully down its throat,
and there now exist many young men who consider that they could not
successfully conduct their lives without this furniture.</p>

<p>To speak generally, I should say that the headgear then supplies
them with a kind of ferocity of indifference. There is fire, sword,
and pestilence in the way they heed only themselves. Philosophy
should always know that indifference is a militant thing. It
batters down the walls of cities, and murders the women and
children amid flames and the purloining of altar vessels. When it
goes away it leaves smoking ruins, where lie citizens bayoneted
through the throat. It is not a children's pastime like mere
highway robbery.</p>

<p>Consequently in America we may be much afraid of these young
men. We dive down alleys so that we may not kowtow. It is a
fearsome thing.</p>

<p>Taught thus a deep fear of the top-hat in its effect upon youth,
I was not prepared for the move of this particular young man when
the cab-horse fell. In fact, I grovelled in my corner that I might
not see the cruel stateliness of his passing. But in the meantime
he had crossed the street, and contributed the strength of his back
and some advice, as well as the formal address, to the cabman on
the importance of looking out immediately.</p>

<p>I felt that I was making a notable collection. I had a new kind
of porter, a cylinder of vision, horses that could skate, and now I
added a young man in a top-hat who would tacitly admit that the
beings around him were alive. He was not walking a churchyard
filled with inferior headstones. He was walking the world, where
there were people, many people.</p>

<p>But later I took him out of the collection. I thought he had
rebelled against the manner of a class, but I soon discovered that
the top-hat was not the property of a class. It was the property of
rogues, clerks, theatrical agents, damned seducers, poor men,
nobles, and others. In fact, it was the universal rigging. It was
the only hat; all other forms might as well be named ham, or chops,
or oysters. I retracted my admiration of the young man because he
may have been merely a rogue.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>There was a window whereat an enterprising man by dodging two
placards and a calendar was entitled to view a young woman. She was
dejectedly writing in a large book. She was ultimately induced to
open the window a trifle. "What nyme, please?" she said wearily. I
was surprised to hear this language from her. I had expected to be
addressed on a submarine topic. I have seen shell fishes sadly
writing in large books at the bottom of a gloomy acquarium who
could not ask me what was my "nyme."</p>

<p>At the end of the hall there was a grim portal marked "lift." I
pressed an electric button and heard an answering tinkle in the
heavens. There was an upholstered settle near at hand, and I
discovered the reason. A deer-stalking peace drooped upon
everything, and in it a man could invoke the passing of a lazy
pageant of twenty years of his life. The dignity of a coffin being
lowered into a grave surrounded the ultimate appearance of the
lift. The expert we in America call the elevator-boy stepped from
the car, took three paces forward, faced to attention and saluted.
This elevator boy could not have been less than sixty years of age;
a great white beard streamed towards his belt. I saw that the lift
had been longer on its voyage than I had suspected.</p>

<p>Later in our upward progress a natural event would have been an
establishment of social relations. Two enemies imprisoned together
during the still hours of a balloon journey would, I believe,
suffer a mental amalgamation. The overhang of a common fate, a
great principal fact, can make an equality and a truce between any
pair. Yet, when I disembarked, a final survey of the grey beard
made me recall that I had failed even to ask the boy whether he had
not taken probably three trips on this lift.</p>

<p>My windows overlooked simply a great sea of night, in which were
swimming little gas fishes.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>I have of late been led to reflect wistfully that many of the
illustrators are very clever. In an impatience, which was donated
by a certain economy of apparel, I went to a window to look upon
day-lit London. There were the 'buses parading the streets with the
miens of elephants There were the police looking precisely as I had
been informed by the prints. There were the sandwich-men. There was
almost everything.</p>

<p>But the artists had not told me the sound of London. Now, in New
York the artists are able to portray sound because in New York a
dray is not a dray at all; it is a great potent noise hauled by two
or more horses. When a magazine containing an illustration of a New
York street is sent to me, I always know it beforehand. I can hear
it coming through the mails. As I have said previously, this which
I must call sound of London was to me only a silence.</p>

<p>Later, in front of the hotel a cabman that I hailed said to
me&mdash;"Are you gowing far, sir? I've got a byby here, and want
to giv'er a bit of a blough." This impressed me as being probably a
quotation from an early Egyptian poet, but I learned soon enough
that the word "byby" was the name of some kind or condition of
horse. The cabman's next remark was addressed to a boy who took a
perilous dive between the byby's nose and a cab in front. "That's
roight. Put your head in there and get it jammed&mdash;a whackin
good place for it, I should think." Although the tone was low and
circumspect, I have never heard a better off-handed declamation.
Every word was cut clear of disreputable alliances with its
neighbors. The whole thing was clean as a row of pewter mugs. The
influence of indignation upon the voice caused me to reflect that
we might devise a mechanical means of inflaming some in that
constellation of mummers which is the heritage of the Anglo-Saxon
race.</p>

<p>Then I saw the drilling of vehicles by two policemen. There were
four torrents converging at a point, and when four torrents
converge at one point engineering experts buy tickets for another
place.</p>

<p>But here, again, it was drill, plain, simple drill. I must not
falter in saying that I think the management of the
traffic&mdash;as the phrase goes&mdash;to be distinctly
illuminating and wonderful. The police were not ruffled and
exasperated. They were as peaceful as two cows in a pasture.</p>

<p>I can remember once remarking that mankind, with all its boasted
modern progress, had not yet been able to invent a turnstile that
will commute in fractions. I have now learned that 756
rights-of-way cannot operate simultaneously at one point.
Right-of-way, like fighting women, requires space. Even two
rights-of-way can make a scene which is only suited to the tastes
of an ancient public.</p>

<p>This truth was very evidently recognized. There was only one
right-of-way at a time. The police did not look behind them to see
if their orders were to be obeyed; they knew they were to be
obeyed. These four torrents were drilling like four battalions. The
two blue-cloth men maneuvered them in solemn, abiding peace, the
silence of London.</p>

<p>I thought at first that it was the intellect of the individual,
but I looked at one constable closely and his face was as afire
with intelligence as a flannel pin-cushion. It was not the police,
and it was not the crowd. It was the police and the crowd. Again,
it was drill.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>I have never been in the habit of reading signs. I don't like to
read signs. I have never met a man that liked to read signs. I once
invented a creature who could play the piano with a hammer, and I
mentioned him to a professor in Harvard University whose
peculiarity was Sanscrit. He had the same interest in my invention
that I have in a certain kind of mustard. And yet this mustard has
become a part of me. Or, I have become a part of this mustard.
Further, I know more of an ink, a brand of hams, a kind of
cigarette, and a novelist than any man living. I went by train to
see a friend in the country, and after passing through a patent
mucilage, some more hams, a South African Investment Company, a
Parisian millinery firm, and a comic journal, I alighted at a new
and original kind of corset. On my return journey the road almost
continuously ran through soap.</p>

<p>I have accumulated superior information concerning these things,
because I am at their mercy. If I want to know where I am I must
find the definitive sign. This accounts for my glib use of the word
mucilage, as well as the titles of other staples.</p>

<p>I suppose even the Briton in mixing his life must sometimes
consult the labels on 'buses and streets and stations, even as the
chemist consults the labels on his bottles and boxes. A brave man
would possibly affirm that this was suggested by the existence of
the labels.</p>

<p>The reason that I did not learn more about hams and mucilage in
New York seems to me to be partly due to the fact that the British
advertiser is allowed to exercise an unbridled strategy in his
attack with his new corset or whatever upon the defensive public.
He knows that the vulnerable point is the informatory sign which
the citizen must, of course, use for his guidance, and then, with
horse, foot, guns, corsets, hams, mucilage, investment companies,
and all, he hurls himself at the point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have discovered a way to make the Sanscrit scholar
heed my creature who plays the piano with a hammer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>The Scotch Express</h2>

<p>The entrance to Euston Station is of itself sufficiently
imposing. It is a high portico of brown stone, old and grim, in
form a casual imitation, no doubt, of the front of the temple of
Nike Apteros, with a recollection of the Egyptians proclaimed at
the flanks. The frieze, where of old would prance an exuberant
processional of gods, is, in this case, bare of decoration, but
upon the epistyle is written in simple, stern letters the word
"EUSTON." The legend reared high by the gloomy Pelagic columns
stares down a wide avenue, In short, this entrance to a railway
station does not in any way resemble the entrance to a railway
station. It is more the front of some venerable bank. But it has
another dignity, which is not born of form. To a great degree, it
is to the English and to those who are in England the gate to
Scotland.</p>

<p>The little hansoms are continually speeding through the gate,
dashing between the legs of the solemn temple; the four-wheelers,
their tops crowded with luggage, roll in and out constantly, and
the footways beat under the trampling of the people. Of course,
there are the suburbs and a hundred towns along the line, and
Liverpool, the beginning of an important sea-path to America, and
the great manufacturing cities of the North; but if one stands at
this gate in August particularly, one must note the number of men
with gun-cases, the number of women who surely have Tam-o'-Shanters
and plaids concealed within their luggage, ready for the moors.
There is, during the latter part of that month, a wholesale flight
from London to Scotland which recalls the July throngs leaving New
York for the shore or the mountains.</p>

<p>The hansoms, after passing through this impressive portal of the
station, bowl smoothly across a courtyard which is in the center of
the terminal hotel, an institution dear to most railways in Europe.
The traveler lands amid a swarm of porters, and then proceeds
cheerfully to take the customary trouble for his luggage. America
provides a contrivance in a thousand situations where Europe
provides a man or perhaps a number of men, and the work of our
brass check is here done by porters, directed by the traveler
himself. The men lack the memory of the check; the check never
forgets its identity. Moreover, the European railways generously
furnish the porters at the expense of the traveler. Nevertheless,
if these men have not the invincible business precision of the
check, and if they have to be tipped, it can be asserted for those
who care that in Europe one-half of the populace waits on the other
half most diligently and well.</p>

<p>Against the masonry of a platform, under the vaulted arch of the
train-house, lay a long string of coaches. They were painted white
on the bulging part, which led halfway down from the top, and the
bodies were a deep bottle-green. There was a group of porters
placing luggage in the van, and a great many others were busy with
the affairs of passengers, tossing smaller bits of luggage into the
racks over the seats, and bustling here and there on short quests.
The guard of the train, a tall man who resembled one of the first
Napoleon's veterans, was caring for the distribution of passengers
into the various bins. There were no second-class compartments;
they were all third and first-class.</p>

<p>The train was at this time engineless, but presently a railway
"flier," painted a glowing vermilion, slid modestly down and took
its place at the head. The guard walked along the platform, and
decisively closed each door. He wore a dark blue uniform thoroughly
decorated with silver braid in the guise of leaves. The way of him
gave to this business the importance of a ceremony. Meanwhile the
fireman had climbed down from the cab and raised his hand, ready to
transfer a signal to the driver, who stood looking at his watch. In
the interval there had something progressed in the large signal box
that stands guard at Euston. This high house contains many levers,
standing in thick, shining ranks. It perfectly resembles an organ
in some great church, if it were not that these rows of numbered
and indexed handles typify something more acutely human than does a
keyboard. It requires four men to play this organ-like thing, and
the strains never cease. Night and day, day and night, these four
men are walking to and fro, from this lever to that lever, and
under their hands the great machine raises its endless hymn of a
world at work, the fall and rise of signals and the clicking swing
of switches.</p>

<p>And so as the vermilion engine stood waiting and looking from
the shadow of the curve-roofed station, a man in the signal house
had played the notes that informed the engine of its freedom. The
driver saw the fall of those proper semaphores which gave him
liberty to speak to his steel friend. A certain combination in the
economy of the London and Northwestern Railway, a combination which
had spread from the men who sweep out the carriages through
innumerable minds to the general manager himself, had resulted in
the law that the vermilion engine, with its long string of white
and bottle-green coaches, was to start forthwith toward
Scotland.</p>

<p>Presently the fireman, standing with his face toward the rear,
let fall his hand. "All right," he said. The driver turned a wheel,
and as the fireman slipped back, the train moved along the platform
at the pace of a mouse. To those in the tranquil carriages this
starting was probably as easy as the sliding of one's hand over a
greased surface, but in the engine there was more to it. The
monster roared suddenly and loudly, and sprang forward impetuously.
A wrong-headed or maddened draft-horse will plunge in its collar
sometimes when going up a hill. But this load of burdened carriages
followed imperturbably at the gait of turtles. They were not to be
stirred from their way of dignified exit by the impatient engine.
The crowd of porters and transient people stood respectful. They
looked with the indefinite wonder of the railway-station sight-seer
upon the faces at the windows of the passing coaches. This train
was off for Scotland. It had started from the home of one accent to
the home of another accent. It was going from manner to manner,
from habit to habit, and in the minds of these London spectators
there surely floated dim images of the traditional kilts, the
burring speech, the grouse, the canniness, the oat-meal, all the
elements of a romantic Scotland.</p>

<p>The train swung impressively around the signal-house, and headed
up a brick-walled cut. In starting this heavy string of coaches,
the engine breathed explosively. It gasped, and heaved, and
bellowed; once, for a moment, the wheels spun on the rails, and a
convulsive tremor shook the great steel frame.</p>

<p>The train itself, however, moved through this deep cut in the
body of London with coolness and precision, and the employees of
the railway, knowing the train's mission, tacitly presented arms at
its passing. To the travelers in the carriages, the suburbs of
London must have been one long monotony of carefully made walls of
stone or brick. But after the hill was climbed, the train fled
through pictures of red habitations of men on a green earth.</p>

<p>But the noise in the cab did not greatly change its measure.
Even though the speed was now high, the tremendous thumping to be
heard in the cab was as alive with strained effort and as slow in
beat as the breathing of a half-drowned man. At the side of the
track, for instance, the sound doubtless would strike the ear in
the familiar succession of incredibly rapid puffs; but in the cab
itself, this land-racer breathes very like its friend, the marine
engine. Everybody who has spent time on shipboard has forever in
his head a reminiscence of the steady and methodical pounding of
the engines, and perhaps it is curious that this relative which can
whirl over the land at such a pace, breathes in the leisurely tones
that a man heeds when he lies awake at night in his berth.</p>

<p>There had been no fog in London, but here on the edge of the
city a heavy wind was blowing, and the driver leaned aside and
yelled that it was a very bad day for traveling on an engine. The
engine-cabs of England, as of all Europe, are seldom made for the
comfort of the men. One finds very often this apparent disregard
for the man who does the work&mdash;this indifference to the man
who occupies a position which for the exercise of temperance, of
courage, of honesty, has no equal at the altitude of prime
ministers. The American engineer is the gilded occupant of a salon
in comparison with his brother in Europe. The man who was guiding
this five-hundred-ton bolt, aimed by the officials of the railway
at Scotland, could not have been as comfortable as a shrill
gibbering boatman of the Orient. The narrow and bare bench at his
side of the cab was not directly intended for his use, because it
was so low that he would be prevented by it from looking out of the
ship's port-hole which served him as a window. The fireman, on his
side, had other difficulties. His legs would have had to straggle
over some pipes at the only spot where there was a prospect, and
the builders had also strategically placed a large steel bolt. Of
course it is plain that the companies consistently believe that the
men will do their work better if they are kept standing. The roof
of the cab was not altogether a roof. It was merely a projection of
two feet of metal from the bulkhead which formed the front of the
cab. There were practically no sides to it, and the large cinders
from the soft coal whirled around in sheets. From time to time the
driver took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his blinking
eyes.</p>

<p>London was now well to the rear. The vermilion engine had been
for some time flying like the wind. This train averages, between
London and Carlisle forty-nine and nine-tenth miles an hour. It is
a distance of 299 miles. There is one stop. It occurs at Crewe, and
endures five minutes. In consequence, the block signals flashed by
seemingly at the end of the moment in which they were sighted.</p>

<p>There can be no question of the statement that the road-beds of
English railways are at present immeasurably superior to the
American road-beds. Of course there is a clear reason. It is known
to every traveler that peoples of the Continent of Europe have no
right at all to own railways. Those lines of travel are too
childish and trivial for expression. A correct fate would deprive
the Continent of its railways, and give them to somebody who knew
about them.</p>

<p>The continental idea of a railway is to surround a mass of
machinery with forty rings of ultra-military law, and then they
believe they have one complete. The Americans and the English are
the railway peoples. That our road-beds are poorer than the English
road-beds is because of the fact that we were suddenly obliged to
build thousands upon thousands of miles of railway, and the English
were obliged to build slowly tens upon tens of miles. A road-bed
from New York to San Francisco, with stations, bridges, and
crossings of the kind that the London and Northwestern owns from
London to Glasgow, would cost a sum large enough to support the
German army for a term of years. The whole way is constructed with
the care that inspired the creators of some of our now obsolete
forts along the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>An American engineer, with his knowledge of the difficulties he
had to encounter&mdash;the wide rivers with variable banks, the
mountain chains, perhaps the long spaces of absolute desert; in
fact, all the perplexities of a vast and somewhat new
country&mdash;would not dare spend a respectable portion of his
allowance on seventy feet of granite wall over a gully, when he
knew he could make an embankment with little cost by heaving up the
dirt and stones from here and there. But the English road is all
made in the pattern by which the Romans built their highways. After
England is dead, savants will find narrow streaks of masonry
leading from ruin to ruin. Of course this does not always seem
convincingly admirable. It sometimes resembles energy poured into a
rat-hole. There is a vale between expediency and the convenience of
posterity, a mid-ground which enables men surely to benefit the
hereafter people by valiantly advancing the present; and the point
is that, if some laborers live in unhealthy tenements in Cornwall,
one is likely to view with incomplete satisfaction the record of
long and patient labor and thought displayed by an eight-foot drain
for a nonexistent, impossible rivulet in the North. This sentence
does not sound strictly fair, but the meaning one wishes to convey
is that if an English company spies in its dream the ghost of an
ancient valley that later becomes a hill, it would construct for it
a magnificent steel trestle, and consider that a duty had been
performed in proper accordance with the company's conscience. But
after all is said of it, the accidents and the miles of railway
operated in England are not in proportion to the accidents and the
miles of railway operated in the United States. The reason can be
divided into three parts&mdash;older conditions, superior caution,
the road-bed. And of these, the greatest is older conditions.</p>

<p>In this flight toward Scotland one seldom encountered a grade
crossing. In nine cases of ten there was either a bridge or a
tunnel. The platforms of even the remote country stations were all
of ponderous masonry in contrast to our constructions of planking.
There was always to be seen, as we thundered toward a station of
this kind, a number of porters in uniform, who requested the
retreat of any one who had not the wit to give us plenty of room.
And then, as the shrill warning of the whistle pierced even the
uproar that was about us, came the wild joy of the rush past a
station. It was something in the nature of a triumphal procession
conducted at thrilling speed. Perhaps there was a curve of infinite
grace, a sudden hollow explosive effect made by the passing of a
signal-box that was close to the track, and then the deadly lunge
to shave the edge of a long platform. There were always a number of
people standing afar, with their eyes riveted upon this projectile,
and to be on the engine was to feel their interest and admiration
in the terror and grandeur of this sweep. A boy allowed to ride
with the driver of the band-wagon as a circus parade winds through
one of our village streets could not exceed for egotism the temper
of a new man in the cab of a train like this one. This valkyric
journey on the back of the vermilion engine, with the shouting of
the wind, the deep, mighty panting of the steed, the gray blur at
the track-side, the flowing quicksilver ribbon of the other rails,
the sudden clash as a switch intersects, all the din and fury of
this ride, was of a splendor that caused one to look abroad at the
quiet, green landscape and believe that it was of a phlegm quiet
beyond patience. It should have been dark, rain-shot, and windy;
thunder should have rolled across its sky.</p>

<p>It seemed, somehow, that if the driver should for a moment take
his hands from his engine, it might swerve from the track as a
horse from the road. Once, indeed, as he stood wiping his fingers
on a bit of waste, there must have been something ludicrous in the
way the solitary passenger regarded him. Without those finely firm
hands on the bridle, the engine might rear and bolt for the
pleasant farms lying in the sunshine at either side.</p>

<p>This driver was worth contemplation. He was simply a quiet,
middle-aged man, bearded, and with the little wrinkles of habitual
geniality and kindliness spreading from the eyes toward the temple,
who stood at his post always gazing out, through his round window,
while, from time to time, his hands went from here to there over
his levers. He seldom changed either attitude or expression. There
surely is no engine-driver who does not feel the beauty of the
business, but the emotion lies deep, and mainly inarticulate, as it
does in the mind of a man who has experienced a good and beautiful
wife for many years. This driver's face displayed nothing but the
cool sanity of a man whose thought was buried intelligently in his
business. If there was any fierce drama in it, there was no sign
upon him. He was so lost in dreams of speed and signals and steam,
that one speculated if the wonder of his tempestuous charge and its
career over England touched him, this impassive rider of a fiery
thing.</p>

<p>It should be a well-known fact that, all over the world, the
engine-driver is the finest type of man that is grown. He is the
pick of the earth. He is altogether more worthy than the soldier,
and better than the men who move on the sea in ships. He is not
paid too much; nor do his glories weight his brow; but for outright
performance, carried on constantly, coolly, and without elation, by
a temperate, honest, clear-minded man, he is the further point. And
so the lone human at his station in a cab, guarding money, lives,
and the honor of the road, is a beautiful sight. The whole thing is
aesthetic. The fireman presents the same charm, but in a less
degree, in that he is bound to appear as an apprentice to the
finished manhood of the driver. In his eyes, turned always in
question and confidence toward his superior, one finds this
quality; but his aspirations are so direct that one sees the same
type in evolution.</p>

<p>There may be a popular idea that the fireman's principal
function is to hang his head out of the cab and sight interesting
objects in the landscape. As a matter of fact, he is always at
work. The dragon is insatiate. The fireman is continually swinging
open the furnace-door, whereat a red shine flows out upon the floor
of the cab, and shoveling in immense mouthfuls of coal to a fire
that is almost diabolic in its madness. The feeding, feeding,
feeding goes on until it appears as if it is the muscles of the
fireman's arms that are speeding the long train. An engine running
over sixty-five miles an hour, with 500 tons to drag, has an
appetite in proportion to this task.</p>

<p>View of the clear-shining English scenery is often interrupted
between London and Crew by long and short tunnels. The first one
was disconcerting. Suddenly one knew that the train was shooting
toward a black mouth in the hills. It swiftly yawned wider, and
then in a moment the engine dived into a place inhabitated by every
demon of wind and noise. The speed had not been checked, and the
uproar was so great that in effect one was simply standing at the
center of a vast, black-walled sphere. The tubular construction
which one's reason proclaimed had no meaning at all. It was a black
sphere, alive with shrieks. But then on the surface of it there was
to be seen a little needle-point of light, and this widened to a
detail of unreal landscape. It was the world; the train was going
to escape from this cauldron, this abyss of howling darkness. If a
man looks through the brilliant water of a tropical pool, he can
sometimes see coloring the marvels at the bottom the blue that was
on the sky and the green that was on the foliage of this detail.
And the picture shimmered in the heat-rays of a new and remarkable
sun. It was when the train bolted out into the open air that one
knew that it was his own earth.</p>

<p>Once train met train in a tunnel. Upon the painting in the
perfectly circular frame formed by the mouth there appeared a black
square with sparks bursting from it. This square expanded until it
hid everything, and a moment later came the crash of the passing.
It was enough to make a man lose his sense of balance. It was a
momentary inferno when the fireman opened the furnace door and was
bathed in blood-red light as he fed the fires.</p>

<p>The effect of a tunnel varied when there was a curve in it. One
was merely whirling then heels over head, apparently in the dark,
echoing bowels of the earth. There was no needle-point of light to
which one's eyes clung as to a star.</p>

<p>From London to Crew, the stern arm of the semaphore never made
the train pause even for an instant. There was always a clear
track. It was great to see, far in the distance, a goods train
whooping smokily for the north of England on one of the four
tracks. The overtaking of such a train was a thing of magnificent
nothing for the long-strided engine, and as the flying express
passed its weaker brother, one heard one or two feeble and immature
puffs from the other engine, saw the fireman wave his hand to his
luckier fellow, saw a string of foolish, clanking flat-cars, their
freights covered with tarpaulins, and then the train was lost to
the rear.</p>

<p>The driver twisted his wheel and worked some levers, and the
rhythmical chunking of the engine gradually ceased. Gliding at a
speed that was still high, the train curved to the left, and swung
down a sharp incline, to move with an imperial dignity through the
railway yard at Rugby. There was a maze of switches, innumerable
engines noisily pushing cars here and there, crowds of workmen who
turned to look, a sinuous curve around the long train-shed, whose
high wall resounded with the rumble of the passing express; and
then, almost immediately, it seemed, came the open country again.
Rugby had been a dream which one could properly doubt. At last the
relaxed engine, with the same majesty of ease, swung into the
high-roofed station at Crewe, and stopped on a platform lined with
porters and citizens. There was instant bustle, and in the interest
of the moment no one seemed particularly to notice the tired
vermilion engine being led away.</p>

<p>There is a five-minute stop at Crewe. A tandem of engines slip
up, and buckled fast to the train for the journey to Carlisle. In
the meantime, all the regulation items of peace and comfort had
happened on the train itself. The dining-car was in the center of
the train. It was divided into two parts, the one being a
dining-room for first-class passengers, and the other a dining-room
for the third-class passengers. They were separated by the kitchens
and the larder. The engine, with all its rioting and roaring, had
dragged to Crewe a car in which numbers of passengers were lunching
in a tranquility that was almost domestic, on an average menu of a
chop and potatoes, a salad, cheese, and a bottle of beer. Betimes
they watched through the windows the great chimney-marked towns of
northern England. They were waited upon by a young man of London,
who was supported by a lad who resembled an American bell-boy. The
rather elaborate menu and service of the Pullman dining-car is not
known in England or on the Continent. Warmed roast beef is the
exact symbol of a European dinner, when one is traveling on a
railway.</p>

<p>This express is named, both by the public and the company, the
"Corridor Train," because a coach with a corridor is an unusual
thing in England, and so the title has a distinctive meaning. Of
course, in America, where there is no car which has not what we
call an aisle, it would define nothing. The corridors are all at
one side of the car. Doors open thence to little compartments made
to seat four, or perhaps six, persons. The first-class carriages
are very comfortable indeed, being heavily upholstered in dark,
hard-wearing stuffs, with a bulging rest for the head. The
third-class accommodations on this train are almost as comfortable
as the first-class, and attract a kind of people that are not
usually seen traveling third-class in Europe. Many people sacrifice
their habit, in the matter of this train, to the fine conditions of
the lower fare.</p>

<p>One of the feats of the train is an electric button in each
compartment. Commonly an electric button is placed high on the side
of the carriage as an alarm signal, and it is unlawful to push it
unless one is in serious need of assistance from the guard. But
these bells also rang in the dining-car, and were supposed to open
negotiations for tea or whatever. A new function has been projected
on an ancient custom. No genius has yet appeared to separate these
two meanings. Each bell rings an alarm and a bid for tea or
whatever. It is perfect in theory then that, if one rings for tea,
the guard comes to interrupt the murder, and that if one is being
murdered, the attendant appears with tea. At any rate, the guard
was forever being called from his reports and his comfortable seat
in the forward end of the luggage-van by thrilling alarms. He often
prowled the length of the train with hardihood and determination,
merely to meet a request for a sandwich.</p>

<p>The train entered Carlisle at the beginning of twilight. This is
the border town, and an engine of the Caledonian Railway, manned by
two men of broad speech, came to take the place of the tandem. The
engine of these men of the North was much smaller than the others,
but her cab was much larger, and would be a fair shelter on a
stormy night. They had also built seats with hooks by which they
hang them to the rail, and thus are still enabled to see through
the round windows without dislocating their necks. All the human
parts of the cab were covered with oilcloth. The wind that swirled
from the dim twilight horizon made the warm glow from the furnace
to be a grateful thing.</p>

<p>As the train shot out of Carlisle, a glance backward could learn
of the faint, yellow blocks of light from the carriages marked on
the dimmed ground. The signals were now lamps, and shone palely
against the sky. The express was entering night as if night were
Scotland.</p>

<p>There was a long toil to the summit of the hills, and then began
the booming ride down the slope. There were many curves. Sometimes
could be seen two or three signal lights at one time, twisting off
in some new direction. Minus the lights and some yards of
glistening rails, Scotland was only a blend of black and weird
shapes. Forests which one could hardly imagine as weltering in the
dewy placidity of evening sank to the rear as if the gods had bade
them. The dark loom of a house quickly dissolved before the eyes. A
station with its lamps became a broad yellow band that, to a
deficient sense, was only a few yards in length. Below, in a deep
valley, a silver glare on the waters of a river made equal time
with the train. Signals appeared, grew, and vanished. In the wind
and the mystery of the night, it was like sailing in an enchanted
gloom. The vague profiles of hills ran like snakes across the
somber sky. A strange shape boldly and formidably confronted the
train, and then melted to a long dash of track as clean as
sword-blades.</p>

<p>The vicinity of Glasgow is unmistakable. The flames of pauseless
industries are here and there marked on the distance. Vast
factories stand close to the track, and reaching chimneys emit
roseate flames. At last one may see upon a wall the strong
reflection from furnaces, and against it the impish and inky
figures of workingmen. A long, prison-like row of tenements, not at
all resembling London, but in one way resembling New York, appeared
to the left, and then sank out of sight like a phantom.</p>

<p>At last the driver stopped the brave effort of his engine The
400 miles were come to the edge. The average speed of forty-nine
and one-third miles each hour had been made, and it remained only
to glide with the hauteur of a great express through the yard and
into the station at Glasgow.</p>

<p>A wide and splendid collection of signal lamps flowed toward the
engine. With delicacy and care the train clanked over some
switches, passes the signals, and then there shone a great blaze of
arc-lamps, defining the wide sweep of the station roof. Smoothly,
proudly, with all that vast dignity which had surrounded its exit
from London, the express moved along its platform. It was the
entrance into a gorgeous drawing-room of a man that was sure of
everything.</p>

<p>The porters and the people crowded forward. In their minds there
may have floated dim images of the traditional music-halls, the
bobbies, the 'buses, the 'Arrys and 'Arriets, the swells of
London.</p>
