<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">IN addition to the homonymous novel Edgar
Wallace wrote at least three short stories featuring Angel,
Esquire, none of which, so far as is known, was collected during
the author's lifetime. These were:</p>

<p class="quote">&bull; "The Yellow Box." This story made its
first appearance in <i>The Story-Teller</i> in March 1908, and
was evidently syndicated. The version included in the present
book, for example, was found in the issue of <i>The Timaru
Herald</i>, New Zealand, published on November 18, 1916. It was
later reprinted under the title "The Monkey and the Box" in the
1984 collection <i>The Sooper and Others</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&bull; "The Silver Charm," published in <i>The
Story-Teller</i> in June 1910 and reprinted in the 1934
collection <i>The Woman from the East</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&bull; "A Case for Angel Esquire," published in
<i>Ideas</i> on March 24, 1909 and reprinted as "The Inspector
Gets a Brainwave" on January 26, 1929. This story also appeared
in the 1984 anthology <i>The Sooper and Others</i> under the
title "The Impossible Theft."</p>

<br>

<p>This PGA/RGL special edition of <i>Angel, Esquire</i>
includes the original novel and the short stories listed above.

<h2><a id="story1" name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE YELLOW
BOX</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Story-Teller</i>, March 1908</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN Christopher Angle went to school he was
very naturally called "Angel" by his fellows. When, in after
life, he established a reputation for tact, geniality, and a
remarkable equability of temper, he became "Angel, Esquire,"
and, as Angel Esquire, he went through the greater portion of
his adventurous life, so that on the coast and in the islands
and in the wild lands that lie beyond the It'uri Forest, where
Mr C. Angle is unknown, the remembrance of Angel, Esquire, is
kept perennially green.</p>

<p>In what department of the Government he was before he took up
a permanent suite of rooms at New Scotland Yard it is difficult
to say. All that is known is that when the "scientific
expedition" of Dr Kauffhaus penetrated to the head waters of the
Kasakasa River, Angel Esquire, was in the neighbourhood shooting
elephants. A native messenger <i>en route</i> to the nearest
post, carrying a newly-ratified treaty, counter-signed by the
native chief, can vouch for Angel's presence, because Angel's
men fell upon him and beat him, and Angel took the newly-sealed
letter and calmly tore it up.</p>

<p>When, too, yet another "scientific expedition," was engaged
in making elaborate soundings in a neutral port in the Pacific,
it was <i>his</i> steam launch that accidentally upset the boat
of the men of science, and many invaluable instruments and
drawings were irretrievably lost in the deeps of the rocky
inlet. Following, however, upon some outrageous international
incident, no less than the&mdash;but perhaps it would be wiser
not to say&mdash;Angel was transferred bodily to Scotland Yard,
undisguisedly a detective, and was placed in charge of the
Colonial Department, which deals with all matters in those
countries&mdash;British or otherwise&mdash;where the temperature
rises above 103 degrees Fahrenheit. His record in this
department was one of unabated success, and the
interdepartmental criticism which was aroused by its creation
and his appointment, have long since been silenced by the
remarkable success that attended, amongst others, his
investigations into the strange disappearance of the Corringham
Mine, the discovery of the Third Slave, and his brilliant and
memorable work in connection with the Croupier's Safe.</p>

<p>To Angel, Esquire, in the early spring came an official of
the Criminal Investigation Department.</p>

<p>"Do you know Congoland at all, Angel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Little bit of it," said Angel modestly.</p>

<p>"Well, here's a letter that the chief wants you to deal
with&mdash;the writer is the daughter of an old friend, and he
would like you to give the matter your personal attention."</p>

<p>Angel's insulting remark about corruption in the public
service need not be placed on record.</p>

<p>The letter was written on notepaper of unusual thinness.</p>

<p>"A lady who has had or is having correspondence with somebody
in a part of the world where the postage rate is high," he said
to himself, and the first words of the letter confirmed this
view:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">My husband, who has just returned from the
Congo, where he has been on behalf of a Belgian firm to report
on alluvial gold discoveries, has become so strange in his
manner, and there are, moreover, such curious circumstances in
connection with his conduct, that I am taking this course,
knowing that as a friend of my dear father's you will not place
any unkind construction upon it, and that you will help me to
get at the bottom of this mystery.</p>

<br>

<p>The letter was evidently hurriedly written. There were words
crossed out and written in.</p>

<p>"Humph," said Angel; "rather a miserable little domestic
drama. I trust I shall not be called in to investigate every
family jar that occurs in the homes of the chief's friends."</p>

<p>But he wrote a polite little note to the lady on his
"unofficial" paper, asking for an appointment and telling her
that he had been asked to make the necessary enquires. The next
morning he received a wire inviting him to go to Dulwich to the
address that had appeared at the head of the note. Accordingly
he started that afternoon, with the irritating sense that his
time was being wasted.</p>

<p>Nine hundred and three Lordship Lane was a substantial-looking
house, standing back from the road, and a trim maid
opened the door to him, and ushered him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>He was waiting impatiently for the lady, when the door was
flung open and a man staggered in. He had an opened letter in
his hand, and there was a look on his face that shocked Angel.
It was the face of a soul in torment&mdash;drawn, haggard, and
white.</p>

<p>"My God! My God!" he muttered: then he saw Angel, and
straightened himself for a moment, for he started forward and
seized the detective by the arm eagerly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you," he gasped, "are you from Liverpool? Have
they sent you down to say it was a mistake?"</p>

<p>There was a rustle of a dress, and a girl came into the room.
She was little more than a girl, but the traces of suffering
that Angel saw had aged her. She came quickly to the side of the
man and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;oh, what is it, Jack?" she entreated.</p>

<p>The man stepped back, shaking his head. "I'm sorry, ver'
sorry," he said dully, and Angel noticed that he clipped his
words. "I thought&mdash;I mistook this gentleman for someone
else."</p>

<p>Angel explained his identity to the girl in a swift
glance.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this is a friend of mine," she faltered, "a
friend of my father's," she went on hesitatingly, "who has
called to see me."</p>

<p>"Sorry&mdash;sorry," he said stupidly. He stumbled to the
door and went out, leaving it open. They heard him blundering up
the stairs, and after a while a door slammed, and there came a
faint "click" as he locked it.</p>

<p>"Oh, can you help me?" cried the girl in distress. "I am
beside myself with anxiety."</p>

<p>"Please sit down, Mrs Farrow," said Angel hastily, but
kindly. A woman on the verge of tears always alarmed him.
Already he felt an unusual interest in the case. "Just tell me
from the beginning."</p>

<p>"My husband is a metallurgist, and a year ago, he was
commissioned by a Belgian company interested in gold-mining to
go to the Congo and report on some property there."</p>

<p>"Had he ever been there before?"</p>

<p>"No; he had never been to Africa before. It was against my
wish that he went at all, but the fee was so temptingly high,
and the opportunities so great, that I yielded to his
persuasion, and allowed him to go."</p>

<p>"How did he leave you?"</p>

<p>"As he had always been&mdash;bright, optimistic, and full of
spirits. We were very happily married, Mr Angel&mdash;" she
stopped, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the alarmed detective; "please go on."</p>

<p>"He wrote by every mail, and even sent natives in their
canoes hundreds of miles to connect with the mail steamers, and
his letters were bright and full of particulars about the
country and the people. Then, quite suddenly, they changed. From
being the cheery, long letters they had been, they became almost
notes, telling me just the bare facts of his movements. They
worried me a little, because I thought it meant that he was ill,
had fever, and did not want me to know."</p>

<p>"And had he?"</p>

<p>"No. A man who was with him said he was never once down with
fever. Well, I cabled to him, but cabling to the Congo is a
heart-breaking business, and there was fourteen days' delay on
the wire."</p>

<p>"I know," said Angel sympathetically, "the land wire down to
Brazzaville."</p>

<p>"Then, before my cable could reach him, I received a brief
telegram from him saying he was coming home."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"There was a weary month of waiting, and then he arrived. I
went to Southampton to meet him."</p>

<p>"To Southampton, not to Liverpool?"</p>

<p>"To Southampton. He met me on the deck, and I shall never
forget the look of agony in his eyes when he saw me. It struck
me dumb. 'What is the matter, Jack?' I asked. 'Nothing,' he
said, in, oh, such a listless, hopeless way. I could get nothing
from him. Almost as soon as he got home he went to his room and
locked the door."</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>"A month ago."</p>

<p>"And what has happened since?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; except that he has got steadily more and more
depressed, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"He gets letters&mdash;letters that he goes to the door to
meet. Sometimes they make him worse, sometimes he gets almost
cheerful after they arrive; but he had his worst bout after the
arrival of the box."</p>

<p>"What box?"</p>

<p>"It came whilst I was dressing for dinner one night. All that
afternoon he had been unusually restless, running down from his
room at every ring of the bell. I caught a glance of it through
his half-opened door."</p>

<p>"Do you not enter his room occasionally?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Nobody has been into his room since his
return; he will not allow the servants in, and sweeps and tidies
it himself."</p>

<p>"Well, and the box?"</p>

<p>"It was about eighteen inches high, and twelve inches square.
It was of polished yellow wood."</p>

<p>"Did it remind you of anything?"</p>

<p>"Of an electric battery," she said slowly. "One of those big
portable things that you can buy at an electrician's."</p>

<p>Angel thought deeply.</p>

<p>"And the letters&mdash;have you seen them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only once, when the postman overlooked a letter, and came
back with it. I saw it for a moment only, because my husband
came down immediately and took it from me."</p>

<p>"And the postmark?"</p>

<p>"It looked like Liverpool," she said.</p>

<p>He questioned her again on one or two aspects that interested
him.</p>

<p>"I must see your husband's room," he said decisively.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will be impossible," she said.</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Angel cheerfully.</p>

<p>Then an unearthly chattering and screeching met their ears,
and the girl turned pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had forgotten the most unpleasant thing&mdash;the
monkey!" she said, and beckoned him from the room. He passed
through the house to the garden at the back. Well sheltered from
the road was a big iron cage, wherein sat a tiny Congo monkey,
shivering in the chill spring air, and drawing about his hairy
shoulders the torn half of a blanket.</p>

<p>"My husband brought one home with him," she said, "but it
died. This is the fifth monkey we have had in a month, and he,
poor beastie, does not look as if he were long for life."</p>

<p>The little animal fixed his bright eyes on Angel, and
chattered dismally.</p>

<p>"They get ill, and my husband shoots them," the girl went on.
"I wanted him to let a veterinary surgeon see the last one, but
he would not."</p>

<p>"Curious," said Angel musingly, and, after making
arrangements to call the next morning, he went back to his
office in a puzzled frame of mind.</p>

<p>He duly reported to his chief the substance of his
interview.</p>

<p>"It isn't drink, and it isn't drugs," he said. "To me it
looks like sheer panic. If that man is not in mortal fear of
somebody or something, I am very much mistaken."</p>

<p>The girl had given him some of the earlier letters she had
received from Africa, and after dinner that night Angel sat down
in his little flat in Jermyn Street to read them. In the first
letter&mdash;it was dated Boma&mdash;occurred a passage that
gave him pause. After telling how he had gone ashore at
Flagstaff, and had made a little excursion up one of the rivers,
the letter went on to say:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Apparently, I have quite unwillingly given
deep offence to one of the secret societies&mdash;if you can
imagine a native secret society&mdash;by buying from a native a
most interesting ju-ju or idol. The native, poor beggar, was
found dead on the beach this morning; and although the official
view is that he was bitten by a poisonous snake, I feel that his
death had something to do with the selling of the idol, which,
by the way, resembles nothing so much as a decrepit
monkey....</p>

<br>

<p>In his search through the letters he could find no other
reference to the incident, except in one of the last of the
longer epistles, where he found:</p>

<p class="letter">...the canoe overturned, and we were
struggling in the water. To my intense annoyance, amongst other
personal effects lost was the coast ju-ju I wrote to you about.
A missionary who lives close at hand said the current, not being
strong about here, the idol is recoverable, and has promised to
send a boy down first, and if he finds it to send it on to me. I
have given him our address at home in case it turns up...."</p>

<br>

<p>"In case it turns up!" repeated Angel. "I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>He knew of these extraordinary societies. He knew, too, how
strong a hold they had in the country that lay behind Flagstaff.
These dreadful organisations were not to be lightly dismissed.
Their power was indisputable.</p>

<p>"The question is, how far are they responsible for the
present trouble?" he said, discussing the affair with his chief
the next morning. "How far the arm of the offended ju-ju can
reach. If we were on the coast I should not be surprised to find
our young friend dead in his bed any morning. But we are in
England&mdash;and in Dulwich to boot!"</p>

<p>"The yellow box may explain everything," said his chief
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And I mean to see it today," said Angel determinedly. He
did not see it that day, for on his return to his office he
found a telegram awaiting him from Mrs Farrow:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">PLEASE COME AT ONCE. MY HUSBAND DISAPPEARED
LAST NIGHT AND HAS NOT RETURNED. HE HAS TAKEN WITH HIM THE BOX
AND THE MONKEY.</p>

<br>

<p>He was ringing at the door of the house within an hour after
receiving the telegram. Her eyes were red with weeping: and it
was a little time before she could speak. Then, brokenly, she
told the story of her husband's disappearance. It was after the
household had retired for the night she thought she heard a
vehicle draw up at the door. She was half asleep, but the sound
of voices roused her, and she got out of bed and looked through
the Venetian blinds. Her room faced the road, and she could see
a carriage drawn up opposite the gate. A man walking beside her
husband, who carried a box, which she recognised as the yellow
box, and in the strange man's arms she could discern, by the
light of the street lamp, a quivering bundle which proved to be
the monkey.</p>

<p>Before she could move or raise the window her husband entered
the carriage, taking with him the monkey, and the other man
jumped up by the side of the driver as the vehicle drove off,
and, as he did, she saw his face. It was that of a negro.</p>

<p>Angel suppressed the exclamation that sprang to his lips as
he heard this. It was evident that she had not attached any
importance to the story of the ju-ju, and he did not wish to
alarm her.</p>

<p>"Did he leave a message?"</p>

<p>She handed him a sheet of paper without replying. Only a few
lines were scrawled on the sheet:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I am a moral coward, darling, and dare not
tell you. If I come back, you will know why I have left you. If
not, pray for me, and remember mo kindly. I have placed all my
money to the credit of your banking account.</p>

<br>

<p>The girl was crying quietly.</p>

<p>"Let me see his room," said Angel; and she conducted him to
the little apartment that was half laboratory and half study. A
truckle bed ran lengthways beneath the window, and a heap of
blackened ashes were piled up in the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Nothing has been touched," said the girl.</p>

<p>Gingerly, Angel lifted the curling ashes one by one.</p>

<p>"I've known burnt paper to..."&mdash;he was going to say
"hang a man," but altered it to "be of great service."</p>

<p>There were one or two pieces that the fire had not burnt, and
some on which the letters were still discernible. One of these
he lifted and carried to the window.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he muttered.</p>

<p>He could not find a complete sentence, but, as he read it:
... very bad ... monkey ... take you away ... your own
fault....</p>

<p>There was a blotting pad upon the little table, and a square
dust mark, where he surmised, the mysterious box stood. He
lifted the pad; underneath were a number of strips of paper.</p>

<p>He glanced at them carelessly, then:</p>

<p>"What on earth?" he said.</p>

<p>Indelibly printed on the slips before him were a dozen red
thumb prints.</p>

<p>He looked at them closely.</p>

<p>The thumb prints were of blood!</p>

<p>Then, in the midst of his mystification a light dawned on
Angel, and he turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Has you husband bought a methylated spirit lamp lately?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said, "a fortnight ago he bought one."</p>

<p>"And has he been asking for needles?"</p>

<p>She almost gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, almost every day!"</p>

<p>Angel looked again at the charred paper and smiled.</p>

<p>"Of course, this may be serious," he said; "but really I
think it isn't at all. If you will content your mind for a day,
I will tell how serious it is; if you will extend your content
for four days, I would almost undertake to promise to restore
him to you."</p>

<p>He left her that afternoon in an agony of suspense, and three
hours afterwards she received a telegram:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">
FOUND YOUR HUSBAND&mdash;EXPECT HIM HOME TOMORROW.</p>

<br>

<p>To his chief Angel explained the mystery in three
minutes.</p>

<p>"I thought the ju-ju had nothing to do with it," he said
cheerfully. "The whole thing illustrates the folly of a man who
had never been further from home than Wiesbaden penetrating
God's primaeval forest. Farrow, on the Congo, surrounded on all
sides by the disease, must needs be suddenly obsessed by the
belief that he has sleeping-sickness. So home he comes, filled
with dread forebodings, and visions of the madness that comes to
the people, with trypanosomiasis. Buys microscopes&mdash;our
yellow box&mdash;and jabs his finger day by day to examine his
blood for microbes. As soon as I heard he had got the approved
spirit lamp for sterilising purposes, I knew that. He
corresponds with the Tropical Schools of Medicine in London and
Liverpool, boring those poor people to death with his outrageous
symptoms. Jabs his blood into monkeys, and when they
die&mdash;of cold and bad feeding&mdash;fears the worst. So, at
last, some wise doctor at the London School, after writing and
telling him that he was an ass, that he couldn't be very bad,
and that the monkey's death wasn't any sign&mdash;except of
cruelty to animals&mdash;offers to take him into hospital for a
few days and put him under observation. So along comes the
hospital carriage, with their nigger porter, and away goes our
foolish hypochondriac, with his monkey and his box of tricks.
They are turning him out of hospital tomorrow."</p> <hr>

<p class="first">ANGEL, ESQUIRE, has a little office at Scotland
Yard, which is partly fitted as a laboratory and partly as a
tiny museum; here he keeps strange drugs and, in glass-stoppered
vessels, curious withered-looking plants with uncanny
properties. There is a faint spicy odour everlastingly present
in Angel's office, which is something between the fragrance of
freshly cut cedar wood and cloves.</p>

<p>When the King of Kantee came to England on his ceremonial
visit he was lionized by London society, and being a man of some
European education, speaking English with a peculiar intonation,
he became remarkably popular. The popularity of King O'fwa had
the natural result of making him rather insufferable. One day
the officials at the Colonial Office, showing him the sights of
London, brought him to Scotland Yard, and in due course he
swaggered into the Colonial Department and favoured Angel with a
patronizing nod.</p>

<p>"Ah, varry nace," said the King amiably.</p>

<p>"King," said Angel, speaking the peculiar drawl of the Kantee
people, "there is that here which is not so pleasant."</p>

<p>The native's insolent eyes met Angel's, and he dropped them
before the calm gaze of the white man.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you," said Angel, still speaking in the
vernacular, "something that the Kings of the Kantee people see
but seldom?"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand and reached down a bottle; he
carefully removed the stopper and drew forth a tiny pencil of
cotton-wool, which he as carefully unrolled. Inside was what
looked like a dried twig, and the King smiled
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Is it magic?" he asked, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>The dry twig lay on the King's palm, and he smiled again.</p>

<p>"This is wood&mdash;a twig," he said. Then he sprang back
with a scream, his eyes wide with terror, and the little twig
fluttered to the ground. Angel picked it up tenderly and wrapped
it about with cotton-wool, the King all the while, with his back
against the wall, shaking in abject fear.</p>

<p>"Is it good magic?" asked Angel carelessly; and the King's
voice was hoarse when he answered:</p>

<p>"It is good&mdash;master!"</p>

<p>Later came a fussy official, sorely puzzled and inclined to
be querulous.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said&mdash;he was a Permanent Under-Secretary
&mdash;"Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Angel: about this
nonsensical thing you showed his Majesty&mdash;we are inclined
to think that you overstepped the mark, sir&mdash;overstepped
the mark." He was a little pompous and a little ruffled, and
wholly disagreeable.</p>

<p>Angel inclined his head respectfully, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Mr. Secretary begs one to say," said the official
impressively, "that it is against all our conception of
the&mdash;er&mdash;system for a great department like Scotland
Yard, or&mdash;er&mdash;for any of its officers, however
important or unimportant they may be, to
practise&mdash;er&mdash;trickery and chicanery of the kind you
introduced to his Majesty, and&mdash;er&mdash;in fact, we think
it extremely reprehensible, sir!" And he looked his
disapproval.</p>

<p>"Mr. Masser," said Angel quietly, "you and I do not view 'his
Majesty' with a common eye. The last time I met the King he was
dining off a relative who had displeased him; the last time I
addressed the King was through the twisty rifling of a point
three-naught-three. The little twig I showed him was a gentle
reminder of an obligation."</p>

<p>The official was still more puzzled.</p>

<p>"One of these fine days," Angel went on calmly, "there will
come a man to the King carrying such a stick as I showed. It may
be Meta, the Congo man, or it may be Abiboo, the Kano man, or it
may be the boy, Jack Fish, from the Monrovian coast; but,
whosoever it is, you may be sure that when they meet the King
will surely die."</p>

<p>How Angel, Esquire, came to know of the blood brotherhood
that was sworn on the Oil River in '84 I do not pretend to know,
nor do I know how he came to possess the fetish-stick&mdash;which
answered the purpose of the broken sixpence so
dear to the lads and lassies of civilization who plight their
troth. But the circumstances of the passing of the King of the
Kantees is well known, and forms the subject of Blue Book
(Africa&mdash;Kantee Protectorate) 7432-07. They found the
King's body in the royal hut one morning; the knife was an
N'Gombi knife, and the rope about his neck was Kano made, but
the method of the killing was distinctly Monrovian, so the
chances are that all three survivors of the blood-pact of '84
took part in the assassination.</p>

<p>The part the fetish-stick played in the fortunes of at least
three unimaginative City men is now well known; they were three
stout, comfortable underwriters, as far removed from mysticism
as is Clapham Common from Bassam.</p>

<p>They do not come into this story. The outward and visible
sign of their connection with the blind witch-doctor is the
service of plate that adorns Angel's sideboard, but there were
days when the man of Basaka held their suburban fortunes in the
hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>In response to communications from Sir Peter Saintsbury,
Angel travelled to Liverpool to see the millionaire controller
of the Lagos Coastwise Line.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe Sir Peter. The story of his
meteoric career is common property. A short, swarthy man with
closely-cropped grey hair and black, piercing eyes, the years he
lived on the Coast have tinted his face a dusky brown. There are
people less charitable who ascribe another cause for his
copper-coloured skin, people who point to his thick lips and
the curious bluish tint of his fingernails.</p>

<p>Sir Peter plunged straight into the matter in hand.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you, Mr. Angel, because my board has decided
that there is some other influence at work beside that which may
be vaguely termed 'bad luck'."</p>

<p>Angel duly noticed the thickness of the voice, and went over
to the side of the uncharitable.</p>

<p>"You are referring to the wreck of the <i>Kinsassa</i>?" said
Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes; and the <i>Noki</i> and the <i>Bolobo</i>," said the
great ship owner impatiently; "three ships in one year, three
new ships, captained by some of my best men, and every one of
them gone ashore in exactly the same spot."</p>

<p>The detective nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The last was under the command of Ryatt, the most competent
skipper in the mercantile marine&mdash;a young man who knows his
business from A to Z. It was he who discovered the shoal passage
into Sierra Leone that cuts off fifty miles of sea travel on the
homeward voyage."</p>

<p>"The weather?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"Here's the log," said Sir Peter. He took from a table a
discoloured volume, and opened it. "Here you are: 'nine-fifteen
&mdash;course W. by W.N.W.&mdash;sea smooth&mdash;wind
light S.W.&mdash;no Fog'."</p>

<p>"Was that the correct course?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have compared all logs and questioned the commodore,
and, of course, the Board of Trade has verified it."</p>

<p>"And she went ashore at nine-thirty?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and, apparently, if you will look at the log again,
there was no sign of the shore."</p>

<p>"H'm." said the detective. "You couldn't very easily miss
it&mdash;high, upstanding cliffs and mountains, so far as I
remember. Who was at the wheel?"</p>

<p>"A reliable quartermaster; the chief officer was on the
bridge, and the captain himself was in his cabin, which is
practically on the bridge. He had left word to be called at
eleven o'clock, at which hour he intended changing the course a
point or so west."</p>

<p>"And then?" questioned Angel.</p>

<p>"And then," said Sir Peter, with a despairing gesture,
"before anybody seemed to realize the fact, the ship was close
inshore&mdash;from what the chief officer said the mountains
appeared as if by magic from the sea. The officer rang the
engines astern, and put the helm over hard to port, but before
the 'way' could get off the steamer, she was piled up. The
captain was on the bridge in an instant and stopped the
engines&mdash;in fact, put them ahead again, for he was afraid
of backing off into deep water and foundering."</p>

<p>"And she is a total wreck?" queried Angel.</p>

<p>"Absolutely; hard and fast on the teeth of a bad reef, with a
hole in her you could drive a coach through." The ship owner
walked to his desk and took from one of the drawers an oblong
box.</p>

<p>"This is the peculiar feature of all the wrecks," he said
with a frown, and opened the box. What he took from it were
three little crosses made of untrimmed wood and lashed across in
their shapes by native grass string.</p>

<p>Angel's eyes lit as he saw them, and he stretched out his
hand eagerly to take them.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled, and handled them gingerly.</p>

<p>"On every wreck," said Sir Peter impressively, "we found one
of these things roughly nailed to the foredeck."</p>

<p>Angel's face was grave as he carried the little emblem to the
window; then:</p>

<p>"You had better let me investigate this matter on the spot,"
he said. "When does the next Coast boat leave Liverpool?"</p>

<p>"One left yesterday," said the ship owner; "another leaves in
a fortnight."</p>

<p>"That will be too late," said the detective decisively. "I
can get a Union-Castle boat to Teneriffe, and pick up your ship
there; to make sure, cable your people to hold the boat for my
arrival."</p>

<p>He stopped at the door.</p>

<p>"You know the Coast?" he asked.</p>

<p>The great ship owner frowned.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly; "as a young man I lived on the
Coast&mdash;I was not always a wealthy man."</p>

<p>Angel nodded.</p>

<p>"Have you offended any of these people in any way?"</p>

<p>Sir Peter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There in no need to bring me personally into the matter," he
said gruffly.</p>

<p>"I see," said Angel, Esquire.</p>

<p>A fortnight later he landed at Sierra Leone and transhipped
to a coasting vessel <i>en route</i> for Bassam.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Going into Cabinda to land sixteen barrels of
raw spirit for the civilization of Portuguese West Africa, the
"second" of the <i>Imagi</i> found time to express his disgust
at inquisitive passengers. The second officer was an excellent
seaman, but had spent the greater part of his life "tramping",
and the occasional passenger was a source of intense annoyance.
The solitary passenger of the <i>Imagi</i> had come aboard at S.
Paul de Loanda, and had worked a slow and inquisitorial way up
the coast. He was a man desirous of acquiring information on
every conceivable subject, but mostly his eternal note of
interrogation was set against the question of curious watch
charms.</p>

<p>He had buttonholed the entire mess-room, from the skipper to
the fourth engineer, buttonholed them at inconvenient moments,
held them helpless against bulkheads and immovable cabin doors,
whilst he threshed out the question of "curios".</p>

<p>He caught the purser, unaccustomed to a passenger list and in
awe of his solitary charge, and reduced him to a condition of
incoherence bordering on imbecility; led him&mdash;he protesting
feebly&mdash;to the tiny purser's office-cabin, domineered him
into opening his desk and displaying his interesting collection
of native table mats and crudely carved ivory napkin rings, and
left him limp and perspiring.</p>

<p>It is also on record that on the transparent pretence of
inspecting the chief engineer's domestic photographs&mdash;at
his own artful suggestion&mdash;he insinuated himself into the
chief's most private domains, and, leading the conversation to
native customs (by way of patent medicines and native doctors),
he caused the stout chief, at great personal inconvenience to
uncord a box which had lain snug for at least two voyages.</p>

<p>On the ninth day of the voyage up from Loanda the steamer
stood inshore.</p>

<p>A strip of yellow beach, with the inevitable fringe of palm
trees, showed up over the horizon, and a patch of white stood
for a white man's house&mdash;and civilization.</p>

<p>The inquisitive passenger standing by the third officer set
up his monotonous interrogation.</p>

<p>"Basaka," said the third brusquely; "we always put in here.
If you are keen on curios, this is the place to get 'em."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any kind. There is an old chap who lives a couple of
miles in the bush who's the biggest medicine man on the Coast.
Wait till the Kroo boys get ashore&mdash;you'll see nothing of
'em for a couple of hours. They always make a point of a palaver
with the old man. They get medicine and charms."</p>

<p>"Basaka!" mused Angel aloud. "Isn't that where Sir Peter
lived?"</p>

<p>The mate grinned.</p>

<p>"The governor! Yes." He looked around for the presence of his
superiors. "He lived here for ten years, did the old man, and a
pretty tough nut he was, from all accounts. Made all his money
in oil and rubber&mdash;as thick as thieves with old Chingo, the
Basaka king." He shook his head wisely.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Angel; and when the ship had anchored he went
ashore.</p>

<p>Paterson, the tired-looking man at the factory, gave him a
chair in the deep veranda, mixed him a cocktail, and furnished
him with some information.</p>

<p>"Going into the bush!" he said in astonishment. "Man, you're
mad. We're a British Protectorate, and all that sort of thing,
we've got a company of Haussas along at Little Basaka&mdash;but
it's not safe."</p>

<p>He whistled a native, and the man came running.</p>

<p>"Hi, Jim," he said in the villainous lingo of the Coast, "dem
massa, he like go for bush, you savvy? For O'saka by them ju-ju
man. You fit for take 'um?"</p>

<p>The man looked at Angel sullenly.</p>

<p>"I no be fit," he said in a low voice: "them ju-ju be bad for
white man."</p>

<p>"You hear?" said the host.</p>

<p>Angel smiled.</p>

<p>"I hear," he said calmly, and addressed the man, speaking
quickly and easily in the native tongue.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Kosongo, master," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Why will you not take me into the bush?"</p>

<p>"Because of the Blind Man's Magic," answered the other
readily. "I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Yet you shall show me the way. When the sun sets I will be
by the big palm at the edge of the bush."</p>

<p>"I cannot come," said the man sulkily.</p>

<p>"By the dried heart of the goat you shall come," said Angel
quietly; and the man shrank down until his hands were fumbling
in the dust.</p>

<p>"I will come," he whispered.</p>

<p>Paterson looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>"What have you said to the chap?" he asked wonderingly, "and
how the deuce did you pick up the lingo?"</p>

<p>Angel's reply was plausible, but not exactly true. Angel
dined ashore, first sending a runner to Little Basaka, carrying
a few words scribbled on the torn leaf of a notebook.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The hut was set away from the village. It stood
in a clearing of its own by a little lagoon. Behind it, on the
land side, a semi-circular screen of tall palms, all hubbly with
the ball-like nests of weaver birds.</p>

<p>The great throng that squatted in a circle about the hut kept
a respectful distance. The sun had gone down&mdash;one by one
they had stolen in from the shadows of the bush, sinking into
their places silently, and as silently remained. No man
approached the door of the hut, they waited patiently as though
some appointed hour had been fixed, seemingly unconscious of one
another's presence, neither greeting the constantly arriving
newcomer nor receiving greeting. Kroo men in tattered sailor
dress, raw natives from the bush, here and there one who bore
the fez or cowl that spoke of his faith in Islam. More than one
was of the educated native class, and squatted gingerly in his
immaculate white ducks. All of them were men&mdash;young men and
old men.</p>

<p>The moon came up over the still lagoon and lit the silent
congregation with its yellow light. One wearing a turban about
his head and a white jellab about his shoulders stole from the
forest and made his way to the front rank. Suddenly from the hut
came a noise like a pattering rain&mdash;practised ear would
have detected it as the sound of little sticks played rapidly on
the tightly stretched skin of a tom-tom. Then a deep voice from
the crowd asked:</p>

<p>"Who sits in the darkness?"</p>

<p>The throng answered with one voice:</p>

<p>"He who sees."</p>

<p>Again the deep voice:</p>

<p>"Who sits in the silence?"</p>

<p>And the whole congregation replied:</p>

<p>"He who hears."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and someone within fumbled at the coarse
native cloth that screened the doorway.</p>

<p>Then from the dark interior of the hut a cracked old voice
croaked:</p>

<p>"Who hath the seeds of Death in his hand and the water of
Life in his gourd?"</p>

<p>With one accord the whole concourse led by one deep voice
shouted, swaying their bodies as they sang:</p>

<p>"Make as strong, oh Ju-ju-ba. Make us rich, oh Ju-ju, We are
weak, we are poor, Give us of thy great surplus."</p>

<p>As they spoke a man came from the hut.</p>

<p>He was old and tall and he came into the flood of yellow
moonlight, staring with sightless eyes toward the lagoon.
Medicine-man as he was, the streaked face and the mask and wig
of his office were absent. A great scar ran down his withered
cheeks as though from the blow of a knife, and yet another
parted the white of his head. A staff was in his hand, and as
the chant finished he struck the ground, and a silence fell upon
the throng.</p>

<p>Sightless he was, but by some extraordinary instinct he
singled out men by name, and they came to him, blundering
through the worshippers&mdash;for such they were&mdash;and
breathing heavily like men who had run a distance. These fell at
the feet of the blind old men, and so waited his pleasure.
Supplicants as they were, he did not ask their business.</p>

<p>"Nogi, of Emfeeta," croaked the old man.</p>

<p>"Master?"</p>

<p>"What charm can make the mealies grow where the fire has been.
What you ask is folly."</p>

<p>The man at his feet slunk away, and another took his
place.</p>

<p>"Who is this? Obero, the Kroo man, who has an enemy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, master."</p>

<p>The man spoke in a strangled tone, for his mouth touched the
dust. The old man loosened a charm from a string that hung over
his bare shoulder.</p>

<p>"Take this. He will die of the sickness, wasting away
slowly."</p>

<p>One by one they crawled to his feet&mdash;bush man,
Mohammedan, and Kroo boy; slave and slave owner, chief and
subject&mdash;and, according to their needs, he served them.
Hour after hour the play went on: the naming of men he could not
see, the uprisings of the summoned man, the prostrations and the
pleadings.</p>

<p>Then it came to an end, and from the crowd he called two men.
Unlike the rest, they rose and stood before him. He spoke to
them by name.</p>

<p>"N'Saka and Igobi&mdash;children of the stars."</p>

<p>"Master." they murmured in unison.</p>

<p>"Who gave you power of hand and eye?"</p>

<p>"You, O master," they said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Who gave you the magic of the silver charm?"</p>

<p>"Master, it was you!"</p>

<p>"Who taught you to gather sleep from the
air&mdash;so!"&mdash;he waved his thin hands quickly&mdash;"who
taught you the great magic that brings death to the
living&mdash;death that is not death?"</p>

<p>"Master, you taught us!"</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Go quickly," he said, "as you went before. Show the white
man the silver charm&mdash;the white man who stands in the
palaver house of the great ship. Show him the charm so that the
moonlight falls upon it, and when his heart is full of the
little charm, wave your hands&mdash;so! Then you shall say to
him three times in your own tongue: 'The Nogi Rock is the open
sea.' Three times shall you say this; and you shall stay with
the ship till the end, and leave the mark of the Ju-ju."</p>

<p>"It shall be so, master," said the men, and they came back to
the throng and sank silently in their places.</p>

<p>The old man waited a moment, leaning on his stick, his blind
eyes fixed on the glittering waters.</p>

<p>Then he turned to go.</p>

<p>Two paces he look towards the hut, then turned back
swiftly.</p>

<p>"What does he want?" he asked hoarsely. "What does he
want&mdash;the white man who sits in the garb of an Arab?"</p>

<p>A dead silence followed the question, then a man who sat on
the inner edge of the circle rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I am he," he said quietly; and a shiver ran through the
people.</p>

<p>The old man took a step towards him and craned his neck
forward as though he would see the face of the man who had
courted the terrible death.</p>

<p>"I am he," the stranger went on. "I have come&mdash;to
learn."</p>

<p>The blind doctor of Basaka curled his lips like an old dog in
his anger.</p>

<p>"You shall learn," he said, and raised his hand. "Strike!" he
cried, and a hundred men rose to his bidding in silence.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, Angel sprang past the old man and gained
the door of the hut. "The dried heart of the goat," that symbol
of Fantee mysticism, would avail him little here. This much he
realized as he reached the dark interior of the hut. He would
gain a little time by his action. He knew enough of the Coast to
know the superstitious natives would not follow him to the
medicine-man's sanctuary. As he reached the middle of the hut
and turned, revolver in hand, he heard the old man's voice.</p>

<p>"White man," he wheezed mockingly, "come back to the quick
death, lest death come all too slowly."</p>

<p>"In time," Angel answered coolly.</p>

<p>"Come, white man," said the voice again; "come, eater of
goats' hearts! Ah, I know you!"</p>

<p>Angel mentally consigned his unwilling guide to an early
grave.</p>

<p>"Come," said the voice, "seeker of charms, who hath sipped
the wisdom of the Blind Man of Basaka&mdash;the hour is at hand.
Yet be sure I will send to him who sent you a sign that you have
learnt what you have learnt&mdash;for I will send him your
heart."</p>

<p>Angel set his teeth and softly pulled back the steel envelope
of his Browning pistol.</p>

<p>"Come for me," he answered; "come, oh wise man, or will you
send one whose life you hold lightly? Oh, people of Basaka,
bushmen, and sons of mad mothers, who will lay his hand on the
white man?"</p>

<p>He heard a whispered order and a patter of bare feet, and the
shadows of two men fell across the threshold.</p>

<p>The first fell dead at the doorway, the second squirmed into
the hut with a bullet through his brain, and the little hut was
filled with the smell of powder.</p>

<p>Angel waited for the inevitable rush.</p>

<p>If they came by twos he could keep them at bay.</p>

<p>He had slipped off the clinging Arab robe and turban. If the
worst came to the worst, he could run.</p>

<p>Again he heard the voice of the blind seer. It was hoarse
with rage, and broken.</p>

<p>He heard the order that meant his death, the hustle of the
closed rank, and the rattle of spear shafts; and then a loud
crack, and another and another, and over all the shrill call of
a bugle and a great rush of feet.</p>

<p>Through the doorway he saw the line of charging Haussas and
heard the fresh voice of the young Englishman in command; then,
as the throng of natives about the hut scattered, he leapt the
bodies of the men in the doorway and caught the arm of the old
man.</p>

<p>The witch-doctor turned with a snarl, and, raising his
iron-shod stick, struck at the detective with surprising force.
Twice he struck, and twice Angel dodged the blow, then he slipped,
and the old man was on him.</p>

<p>For a moment Angel thought his last hour had come. Lean and
old as the witch-doctor was, he was possessed of the strength of
a maniac. He loosened one hand to fumble in the rags about his
middle, and Angel, making a last despairing effort, threw
himself over to where his fallen pistol lay.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"Dead?" said the Haussa captain, looking down
at the fallen man.</p>

<p>"I think not," said Angel. "Phew!" He wiped the streaming
perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"H'm," said the officer looking at the prostrate witch-doctor.
"So the Blind Wizard is finished. There will be an awful
palaver over this."</p>

<p>Angel nodded.</p>

<p>"He's not blind," he said quietly. "I found that out an hour
ago. Some dreadful thing must have happened to his
eyes&mdash;but he can see."</p>

<p>The old man groaned and looked up. He saw Angel and smiled.
Then, to the detective's amazement, he spoke in perfect
English.</p>

<p>"So now you know all about it&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>He spoke painfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angel in English. "I know all about it."</p>

<p>The old man inclined his head.</p>

<p>"The trick of mesmerism that I taught my men&mdash;it is
simple to mesmerise a man who is looking at some bright
object."</p>

<p>Angel nodded.</p>

<p>"And as simple to suggest to the subject that the course that
brings up at the Nogi Rock is the open sea," he said.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ruin Peter," said the old native, "and when I
had ruined him, I wanted to kill him. He is my brother."</p>

<p>He made the monstrous statement calmly and Angel believed
him.</p>

<p>The old medicine-man was silent for a while, then he
resumed.</p>

<p>"My younger brother&mdash;born of the same black
mother&mdash;inheriting the same fortune. I was at Christ's
College, Cambridge," he said inconsequently.</p>

<p>"Peter took the money and the stores. He sent me to trade in
the bush. Then he sent men after me to put out my
eyes&mdash;because he was ambitious and looked down upon his
blacker brother."</p>

<p>He was silent so long that they thought he was dead, but
after a while he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Christ's College, Cambridge," he murmured. Then in the
native tongue he uttered the proverb of the Kantee people: "The
river overflows but runs back to its bed." Then he died.</p>

<p>As for Sir Peter Saintsbury, the swarthy ship owner, he too
died within the year, and I'saka, the Kroo boy who was with him
when he died, was hanged at Liverpool a few months later.</p>

ANGEL, ESQUIRE</h2>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THERE was a Minister of France&mdash;was it
Necker?&mdash;who suggested on a memorable occasion that the
people should eat grass. He was no vegetarian, he was just being
rude; and when, on a subsequent occasion, an indignant populace
slew him, in some grim way they decorated the body
significantly.</p>

<p>If it should happen that the lawless folk of Notting Dale
should ever fall upon Police Constable Lee, I doubt not that the
jibe with which they will assail him will have some reference to
'sparrows,' for to the mysterious agency of the 'little sparrow'
is due a great deal of the worthy officer's unpopularity amongst
a certain class of people in his salubrious district.</p>

<p>PC Lee, in mufti, stepped round to the marine store of Cokey
Salem, and asked to see the proprietor.</p>

<p>Cokey, so-called because of the commodity he runs as a side
line to the rag-and-bone business, was not at home.</p>

<p>He shouted down the stairs to his frowsy wife to that effect
and PC Lee was not convinced.</p>

<p>After a while, Cokey was induced to come down into the
evil-smelling shop, and he did this with an ill grace.</p>

<p>'Hullo,' he said, gruffly, 'what's this&mdash;water
rates?'</p>

<p>'To be exact,' said PC Lee, gently, 'it's a question of lead
pipin', feloniously removed from unoccupied premises, to wit,
914, Kensington Park Road.'</p>

<p>'Ho!' said the defiant Cokey, 'an' what's that gotter do with
me?'</p>

<p>'If you'll kindly step round to the station,' said the
police-constable, 'I daresay you can explain the whole matter to
our inspector in a few words.'</p>

<p>'Suppose I don't?'</p>

<p>'In that case,' said the thoughtful constable, 'I shall be
under the painful necessity of takin' you.'</p>

<p>Cokey choked back a wicked word, put on his coat and hat, and
accompanied the constable.</p>

<p>'Where did you nose this job?' he asked, vulgarly.</p>

<p>'A little sparrer,' said the reflective PC,
'happened&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'd like to get hold of that sparrer of yours,' said Cokey,
between his teeth, I'd wring his blanky neck.'</p>

<p>On the occasion under review, Cokey did not convince a
sceptical inspector of his innocence. Nor had he any better luck
with a frozen-faced magistrate, who listened dispassionately to
Cokey's somewhat involved story. According to Cokey the lead
piping found on his premises had</p>

<p class="quote"><i>"Fallen like the gentle rain from heaven, upon
the place beneath."</i></p>

<br>

<p>This magistrate, who had never been known to smile, relaxed
when Cokey adduced his crowning argument that the piping had
been placed in his yard by the police, and committed Cokey to
the Middlesex Sessions.</p>

<p>The Chairman of that Court, aided by a bored jury, found
Cokey guilty of receiving, and the Chairman having, figuratively
speaking, said it would be as much as his place was worth to
give him less, sent Cokey to prison with hard labour for nine
calendar months.</p>

<p>Whereupon the prisoner, affectionately addressing PC Lee,
said that on some future occasion he would have the heart,
lungs, and important blood vessels of the impassive
officer&mdash;though exactly what he would do with them he did
not say.</p>

<p>I saw PC Lee some nine months later, and knowing that Cokey
was at liberty, I expressed my surprise at finding him still
alive.</p>

<p>PC Lee smiled.</p>

<p>'If the Government would give prisoners leave of absence on
the day they are sentenced,' he said, 'I daresay he might have
caused me inconvenience; but barrin' that, I shall die a natural
death. If a chap who had been sentenced heavily suddenly found
himself pardoned, he'd be so overjoyed that he wouldn't have any
time to hate me or any other constable, an' even a man who goes
to a long term soon loses all the bad feelin' he ever had, an'
comes out of "stir" full of a peace-on-earth-an'-good-will
feelin'.</p>

<p>'In prison you've got a lot of time to think, an' if a man
isn't a lunatic, he works out the situation reasonably an' comes
to the conclusion that the constable has only done his duty, an'
by the time the sentence is worked out, he's lost all his
dislike for the man who lagged him.</p>

<p>'The only time I ever knew a man to bear animosity was in the
case of the Newton Lane Robbery.</p>

<p>'If you don't remember the case, I'll give it to you in a few
words. A cashier from one of the Ladbroke Grove shops was goin'
back to his premises from the bank at Notting Hill Gate, when he
was set upon by half-a-dozen roughs, knocked down an' robbed.
All this happened in broad daylight, but in an unfrequented
little turning, an' the assailants got away.</p>

<p>'It so happened that I was off duty (I was in X Division at
the time), but I got to hear of the case when I reported for
duty that night.</p>

<p>'The young fellow who was robbed had been taken to the
hospital, but as he wasn't so badly hurt, he was allowed to go
home. Accordin' to him, he wouldn't be able to recognise any of
the party.</p>

<p>'Now, the detection of crime, as I see it, is a simple
matter. The criminal is the obvious person. Don't you believe
these detective stories that tell you that the feller found with
the diamonds in his pocket is the innocent hero&mdash;he's only
the innocent hero in story books. In real life he's the feller
that did the robbery.</p>

<p>'When the police find a little sub-post-office has been
robbed, an' the postmaster lyin' bound an' gagged, or when they
see a bank clerk lyin' on the floor with the smell of chloroform
hangin' round an' the safe open, they know it's 33 to 1 that
they've got the robber first pop, an' that the enterprisin'
burglar, as the song says, is the young feller found in such a
romantic attitude.</p>

<p>'Unprofessional criminals spend too much of their time in
preparin' picturesque scenes, an' professional criminals spend
too much time in gettin' ready alibis, an' between one an' the
other the police have a fairly easy time.</p>

<p>'So that it was only natural that our first suspicions
fastened on the feller that had been robbed, an' there were
certain features of it that made this view likely. Nobody had
seen him attacked, nobody had seen men comin' away from the
scene of the crime, an' if he hadn't been so badly injured there
would have been no doubt whatever that he was the robber
himself, an' the whole 'outrage' a fake.</p>

<p>'This might have been the case with the young cashier, only
there was a remarkable flaw in the theory. He'd left the bank
with five notes for a hundred pounds (which had been drawn for
the purpose of sendin' to Russia to settle an account), an' this
he placed in a big handbag which he carried, an' which was found
open an' empty.</p>

<p>'He was carefully searched, but no money was on him when he
was found. He had been seen enterin' the little street. One of
the bank clerks, who happened to leave the bank at the same
time, had walked with him to the entrance of the street, an'
nobody had been seen to leave at either end before he was
discovered. If he'd stolen 'em himself&mdash;what had happened
to the banknotes? He couldn't bury 'em. There was no place in
the street itself where they could have been hidden&mdash;you
may be sure that we searched every possible hidin'
place&mdash;an' the police were forced to believe that his story
was true.</p>

<p>'The only thing against the man was that his firm had lost
money before from their office. Ten, twenty, an' fifty pound
notes had vanished, but the cashier was so above suspicion, an'
had always insisted upon bein' the first to be searched, that
they had never dreamt of connectin' him with any theft, an' had
discharged clerk after clerk in consequence.</p>

<p>'It was such an interestin' case that the Yard sent down Mr
Angel&mdash;you wrote about him didn't you?&mdash;a rare nice
gentleman, who's always pullin' your leg, but very pleasant with
it.</p>

<p>'Our inspector was asked to tell off a man to accompany Mr
Angel, an' to my surprise I was chosen instead of some of our
smart fellers.</p>

<p>'"Lee," says the inspector, "you go round with Mr Angel, an'
introduce him to some of the 'heads' in your neighbourhood." So,
in a manner of speakin', I was put in charge of Angel.</p>

<p>'But, bless you, he didn't want any introducin'! He knew all
the toughs: knew Nick Moss, an' Percy Steel, an' Jim the Fence;
knew 'em as if he'd been brought up with 'em&mdash;an' they knew
him.</p>

<p>'We might have saved ourselves the trouble, because we learnt
very little from these chaps, except from Nick Moss.</p>

<p>'"Hullo. Nick," says Angel, Esquire, most cheerfully, "how is
the ladder larceny business?"</p>

<p>'Nick grinned a bit sheepish.</p>

<p>'"I'm straight now, Mr Angel," he says; "the other game's a
mug's game."</p>

<p>'"Cutting out all your blessed platitudes," says Angel,
"which of your college companions did this last little job?"</p>

<p>'"If I never move from here," says Nick, most solemn, "if I
die this very minute, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"Havin' been duly sworn," says Mr Angel, "it is unnecessary
to go any further&mdash;I gather from your interestin', but
altogether unnecessary, protestation that you don't know."</p>

<p>'"That's right, sir," says Nick.</p>

<p>'Mr Angel told me later that he quite believed Nick didn't
know for sure, but he thought that he had a suspicion.</p>

<p>'We examined the street where the robbery was committed. It
is a street with stables on one side an' little houses on the
other, an' connects Portobello Road with Pembridge Road.</p>

<p>'Nobody could give us any information about the robbery; in
the majority of cases the first they knew about it was when the
cashier had been found lyin' on the side-walk. Next we made a
few inquiries about the cashier an' found that he was a most
respectable man, with money of his own in the bank, a
churchwarden, an' a member of the Young Men's Christian
Association. What was most important was, he'd got money of his
own in the bank.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Lee," says Mr Angel, "that this case must go
down to history as 'The Notting Hill Mystery,'" and so it might
have done but for the fact that one of the most curious
coincidences happened that you could ever imagine.</p>

<p>'You've heard me talk about my "little sparrow?" It's a
wheeze I work on the lads who want to know where I get all my
valuable information from. This "cod" of mine got round to Mr
Angel's ears, an' he remarked to me, in that jokin' way of
his:</p>

<p>'"What a pity, Lee, your feathered friend can't supply us
with a brilliant word picture of what happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>'He stopped short sudden, an' frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'"By George!" says he, "I wonder if that is possible?"</p>

<p>'I couldn't see what he was gettin' at, so I waited.</p>

<p>'"We'll go round an' see our cashier friend," says Angel, so
off we went to a neat little house near Wormwood Scrubbs.</p>

<p>'He was a bachelor, but rented a house, an' he opened the
door to us himself, an' invited us in.</p>

<p>'It was a comfortably furnished sittin'-room, an' I saw Angel
give a quick glance round as though sizing up the place. The
only thing I noticed was that Mr Killun&mdash;that was his
name&mdash;made a hasty attempt to fold up a newspaper that he'd
been readin'.</p>

<p>'Killun was a pale-faced youth with uneven features an' a
shifty eye, an' I disliked him from the first.</p>

<p>'"Readin', Mr Killun?" says Angel.</p>

<p>'"Yes," says Killun, quickly, "I'm naturally interested in
learnin' if the police have any clue as to the people who robbed
me."</p>

<p>'Angel, Esquire nodded, but said nothin'.</p>

<p>'By-an'-bye, he asked carelessly: "By the way, what are
Southern Pacific Preferred?"</p>

<p>'"Sixty-four," said Killun, quick&mdash;then checked
himself&mdash;"at least, I believe so&mdash;I don't take much
interest in Stock Exchange transactions."</p>

<p>'"I suppose not," says Angel, an' went on talkin' about the
robbery an' about things in general. He touched on the Lincoln
Handicap, but Mr Killun said he knew nothin' about racin', an'
that was probably so, because Angel referred to the Lincoln as a
two mile race, an' no racin' man could have resisted the
temptation to correct him.</p>

<p>'We left, an' Angel went away to London to make a few
inquiries. He came back that night, an' together we went to
Killun's house.</p>

<p>'"I want to see the bag you carried the notes in," says
Angel.</p>

<p>'To my surprise the man produced it. I was surprised, because
the bag ought to have been in the possession of the police, an'
it only shows you how we are sometimes caught nappin', for
without that bag the robber might never have been caught.</p>

<p>'Angel took the bag and examined it.</p>

<p>'"This is an enormous bag to carry five hundred pound notes
in?"</p>

<p>'"It's the only one I've got," said the man, a little
sullenly.</p>

<p>'Angel took it under the light an' inspected the inside. Then
he laid a sheet of paper on the table an' shook out the
contents. There was nothin' in it, except a few crumbs of
tobacco, a little dust, an' somethin' that Angel, Esquire picked
up an' examined carefully.</p>

<p>'It was a tiny grey feather, an' he nodded slowly.</p>

<p>'Then he turned to Killun.</p>

<p>'"I shall take you into custody," he said, "on a charge of
stealin' five hundred pounds, the property of your
employer."</p>

<p>'"It's a lie!" said Killun, hoarsely, an' tried to bolt. But
I caught him, an' as he was inclined to be a little bit fresh, I
put the handcuffs on him.</p>

<p>'We took him down to the station, an' then went back an'
searched the house. On the roof, in a cage, we found a
pigeon.</p>

<p>'"There's your little bird, Lee," says Angel, with a chuckle.
"That's one of the little birds that was in Mr Killun's big bag.
Not this chap, but others like him. A hundred-pound note
fastened with an elastic band round each leg&mdash;an'
whiff!&mdash;goes five hundred. He must have sent three
birds."</p>

<p>'Angel spent some time that night concoctin' a message. He
wrote it on a slip of thin paper an' fitted it to the pigeon's
leg. Then he flew the pigeon.</p>

<p>'Next mornin', at eleven o'clock, we arrested an eminent
bucket-shop* keeper, who turned up outside the Mansion House by
appointment&mdash;Angel made the appointment.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Bucket-shop</i>: A fraudulent
brokerage operation in which orders to buy and sell are accepted
but no executions take place. Instead, the operators expect to
profit when customers close out their positions at a loss.]</p>

<p>'This,' said PC Lee, impressively, 'proves my words, that the
real criminal is the obvious criminal. Killun had been
speculatin' an' had got into difficulties with the bucket-shop.
The man that ran the shop wanted the money, an' bein' a bit of a
pigeon fancier, had suggested a way of gettin' Killun out of his
difficulties.</p>

<p>'Killun would take the birds in his bag to the office, an'
whenever he could lay his hands on paper money, would nip out
into the cloakroom, fix the note, an' fly the bird through a
window, an' be back at his desk before anybody noticed his
absence.'</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>ANGEL, ESQUIRE &mdash; THE
NOVEL</h2>

<h2>I. &mdash; THE LOMBARD STREET DEPOSIT</h2>

<p class="first">MR. WILLIAM SPEDDING, of the firm of Spedding,
Mortimer and Larach, Solicitors, bought the site in Lombard
Street in the conventional way. The property came into the
market on the death of an old lady who lived at Market
Harborough, who has nothing to do with this story, and it was
put up to auction in the orthodox fashion. Mr. William Spedding
secured the site at 106,000, a sum sufficiently large to excite
the interest of all the evening papers and a great number of the
morning journals as well. As a matter of exact detail, I may add
that plans were produced and approved by the city surveyor for
the erection of a building of a peculiar type. The city surveyor
was a little puzzled by the interior arrangement of the new
edifice, but as it fulfilled all the requirements of the
regulations governing buildings in the City of London, and no
fault could be found either with the external
appearance&mdash;its facade had been so artfully designed that
you might pass a dozen times a day without the thought occurring
that this new building was anything out of the common
ruck&mdash;and as the systems of ventilation and light were
beyond reproach, he passed the plans with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand, Mr. Spedding," he said, laying his
forefinger on the blue print, "how your client intends securing
privacy. There is a lobby and one big hall. Where are the
private offices, and what is the idea of this huge safe in the
middle of the hall, and where are the clerks to sit? I suppose
he will have clerks? Why, man, he won't have a minute's
peace!"</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding smiled grimly. "He will have all the peace he
wants," he said. "And the vaults&mdash;I should have thought
that vaults would be the very thing you wanted for this." He
tapped the corner of the sheet where was inscribed decorously:
"Plan for the erection of a New Safe Deposit."</p>

<p>"There is the safe," said Mr. Spedding, and smiled again.</p>

<p>This William Spedding, now unhappily no longer with
us&mdash;he died suddenly, as I will relate&mdash;was a large,
smooth man with a suave manner. He smoked good cigars, the ends
of which he snipped off with a gold cigar-cutter, and his smile
came readily, as from a man who had no fault to find with life.
To continue the possibly unnecessary details, I may add further
that whilst tenders were requested for the erection of the New
Safe Deposit, the provision of the advertisement that the lowest
tender would not necessarily be accepted was justified by the
fact that the offer of Potham and Holloway was approved, and it
is an open secret that their tender was the highest of all.</p>

<p>"My client requires the very best work; he desires a building
that will stand shocks." Mr. Spedding shot a swift glance at the
contractor, who sat at the other side of the desk. "Something
that a footling little dynamite explosion would not scatter to
the four winds."</p>

<p>The contractor nodded.</p>

<p>"You have read the specification," the solicitor went
on&mdash;he was cutting a new cigar, "and in regard to the
pedestal&mdash;ah&mdash;the pedestal, you know&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at the contractor.</p>

<p>"It seems all very clear," said the great builder. He took a
bundle of papers from an open bag by his side and read, "The
foundation to be of concrete to the depth of twenty feet... The
pedestal to be alternate layers of dressed granite and steel...
in the centre a steel-lined compartment, ten inches by five, and
half the depth of the pedestal itself."</p>

<p>The solicitor inclined his head. "That pedestal is to be the
most important thing in the whole structure. The steel-lined
recess&mdash;I don't know the technical phrase&mdash;which one
of these days your men will have to fill in, is the second most
important; but the safe that is to stand fifty feet above the
floor of the building is to be&mdash;but the safe is arranged
for."</p>

<p>An army of workmen, if the hackneyed phrase be permitted,
descended upon Lombard Street and pulled down the old buildings.
They pulled them down, and broke them down, and levered them
down, and Lombard Street grew gray with dust. The interiors of
quaint old rooms with grimy oak panelling were indecently
exposed to a passing public. Clumsy, earthy carts blocked
Lombard Street, and by night flaring Wells' lights roared amidst
the chaos. And, bare-armed men sweated and delved by night and
by day; and one morning Mr. Spedding stood in a drizzle of rain,
with a silk umbrella over his head, and expressed, on behalf of
his client, his intense satisfaction at the progress made. He
stood on a slippery plank that formed a barrow road, and
workmen, roused to unusual activity by the presence of "The
Firm"&mdash;Mr. Spedding's cicerone&mdash;moved to and fro at a
feverish rate of speed.</p>

<p>"They don't mind the rain," said the lawyer, sticking out his
chin in the direction of the toiling gangs.</p>

<p>"The Firm" shook his head. "Extra pay," he said laconically,
"we provided for that in the tender," he hastened to add in
justification of his munificence.</p>

<p>So in rain and sunshine, by day and by night, the New Safe
Deposit came into existence. Once&mdash;it was during a night
shift&mdash;a brougham drove up the deserted city street, and a
footman helped from the dark interior of the carriage a
shivering old man with a white, drawn face. He showed a written
order to the foreman, and was allowed inside the unpainted gate
of the "works." He walked gingerly amidst the debris of
construction, asked no questions, made no replies to the
explanations of the bewildered foreman, who wondered what
fascination there was in a building job to bring an old man from
his bed at three o'clock on a chill spring morning.</p>

<p>Only once the old man spoke. "Where will that there pedestal
be?" he asked in a harsh, cracked cockney voice; and when the
foreman pointed out the spot, and the men even then busily
filling in the foundation, the old man's lips curled back in an
ugly smile that showed teeth too white and regular for a man of
his age.</p>

<p>He said no more, but pulled the collar of his fur coat the
tighter about his lean neck and walked wearily back to his
carriage. The building saw Mr. Spedding's client no
more&mdash;if, indeed, it was Mr. Spedding's client. So far as
is known, he did not again visit Lombard Street before its
completion&mdash;even when the last pane of glass had been fixed
in the high gilded dome, when the last slab of marble had been
placed in the ornate walls of the great hall, even when the
solicitor came and stood in silent contemplation before the
great granite pedestal that rose amidst a scaffolding of slim
steel girders supporting a staircase that wound upward to the
gigantic mid-air safe. Not quite alone, for with him was the
contractor, awed to silence by the immensity of his
creation.</p>

<p>"Finished!" said the contractor, and his voice came echoing
back from the dim spaces of the building.</p>

<p>The solicitor did not answer.</p>

<p>"Your client may commence business tomorrow if he
wishes."</p>

<p>The solicitor turned from the pedestal. "He is not ready
yet," he said softly, as though afraid of the echoes. He walked
to where the big steel doors of the hall stood ajar, the
contractor following. In the vestibule he took two keys from his
pocket. The heavy doors swung noiselessly across the entrance,
and Mr. Spedding locked them. Through the vestibule and out into
the busy street the two men walked, and the solicitor fastened
behind him the outer doors.</p>

<p>"My client asks me to convey his thanks to you for your
expedition," the lawyer said.</p>

<p>The builder rubbed his hands with some satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You have taken two days less than we expected," Mr. Spedding
went on. The builder was a man of few ideas outside his
trade.</p>

<p>He said again: "Yes, your client may start business
tomorrow."</p>

<p>The solicitor smiled. "My client, Mr. Potham, may
not&mdash;er&mdash;start business&mdash;for ten years," he said.
"In fact, until&mdash;well, until he dies, Mr. Potham."</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE HOUSE IN TERRINGTON
SQUARE</a></h2>

<p class="first">A MAN turned into Terrington Square from
Seymour Street and walked leisurely past the policeman on point
duty, bidding him a curt "good night." The other subsequently
described the passer, as a foreign-looking gentleman with a
short pointed beard. Under the light overcoat he was apparently
in evening dress, for the officer observed the shoes with the
plain black bow, and the white silk muffler and the crush hat
supported that view. The man crossed the road, and disappeared
round the corner of the railed garden that forms the centre of
the square. A belated hansom came jingling past, and an early
newspaper cart, taking a short cut to Paddington, followed; then
the square was deserted save for the man and the policeman. The
grim, oppressive houses of the square werewrapped in sleep-drawn
blinds and shuttered windows and silence.</p>

<p>The man continued his stroll until he came abreast of No. 43.
Here he stopped for a second, gave one swift glance up and down
the thoroughfare, and mounted the three steps of the house. He
fumbled a little with the key, turned it, and entered. Inside he
stood for a moment, then taking a small electric lamp from his
pocket he switched on the current. He did not trouble to survey
the wide entrance hall, but flashed the tiny beam of light on
the inside face of the door. Two thin wires and a small coil
fastened to the lintel called forth no comment. One of the wires
had been snapped by the opening of the door.</p>

<p>"Burglar-alarm, of course," he murmured approvingly. "All the
windows similarly treated, and goodness knows what pitfalls
waiting for the unwary."</p>

<p>He flashed the lamp round the hall. A heavy Turkish rug at
the foot of the winding staircase secured his attention. He took
from his pocket a telescopic stick, extended it, and fixed it
rigid. Then he walked carefully towards the rug. With his stick
he lifted the corner, and what he saw evidently satisfied him,
for he returned to the door, where in a recess stood a small
marble statue. All his strength was required to lift this, but
he staggered back with it, and rolling it on its circular base,
as railway porters roll milk churns, he brought it to the edge
of the rug. With a quick push he planted it square in the
centre of the carpet. For a second only it stood, oscillating,
then like a flash it disappeared, and where the carpet had lain
was a black, gaping hole.</p>

<p>He waited. Somewhere from the depths came a crash, and the
carpet came slowly up again and filled the space. The
unperturbed visitor nodded his head, as though again approving
the householder's caution.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he has learnt any new ones," he murmured
regretfully, "he is getting very old."</p>

<p>He took stock of the walls. They were covered with paintings
and engravings.</p>

<p>"He could not have fixed the cross tire in a modern house,"
he continued, and taking a little run, leapt the rug and rested
for a moment on the bottom stair. A suit of half armor on the
first landing held him in thoughtful attention for a moment.</p>

<p>"Elizabethan body, with a Spanish bayonet," he said
regretfully; "that doesn't look like a collector's
masterpiece."</p>

<p>He flashed the lamp up and down the silent figure that stood
in menacing attitude with a raised battle-axe.</p>

<p>"I don't like that axe," he murmured, and measured the
distance.</p>

<p>Then he saw the fine wire that stretched across the landing.
He stepped across carefully, and ranged himself alongside the
steel knight. Slipping off his coat, he reached up and caught
the figure by the wrist. Then with a quick jerk of his foot he
snapped the wire. He had been prepared for the mechanical
downfall of the axe; but as the wire broke the figure turned to
the right, and swish! came the axe in a semicircular cut. He had
thought to hold the arm as it descended, but he might as well
have tried to hold the piston-rod of an engine. His hand was
wrenched away, and the razor-like blade of the axe missed his
head by the fraction of a second. Then with a whir the arm rose
stiffly again to its original position and remained rigid.</p>

<p>The visitor moistened his lips and sighed.</p>

<p>"That's a new one, a very new one," he said under his breath,
and the admiration in his tone was evident. He picked up his
overcoat, flung it over his arm, and mounted half a dozen steps
to the next landing. The inspection of the Chinese cabinet was
satisfactory. The white beam of his lamp flashed into corners
and crevices and showed nothing. He shook the curtain of a
window and listened, holding his breath.</p>

<p>"Not here," he muttered decisively, "the old man wouldn't try
that game. Snakes turned loose in a house in London, S.W., take
a deal of collecting in the morning."</p>

<p>He looked round. From the landing access was gained to three
rooms. That which from its position he surmised faced the street
he did not attempt to enter. The second, covered by a heavy
curtain, he looked at for a time in thought. To the third he
walked, and carefully swathing the door-handle with his silk
muffler, he turned it. The door yielded. He hesitated another
moment, and jerking the door wide open, sprang backward. The
interior of the room was for a second only in pitch darkness,
save for the flicker of light that told of an open fireplace.
Then the visitor heard a click, and the room was flooded with
light. In the darkness on the landing the man waited; then a
voice, a cracked old voice, said grumblingly:</p>

<p>"Come in." Still the man on the landing waited. "Oh, come in,
Jimmy&mdash;I know ye."</p>

<p>Cautiously the man outside stepped through the entry into the
light and faced the old man, who, arrayed in a wadded
dressing-gown, sat in a big chair by the fire, an old man, with
white face and a sneering grin, who sat with his lap full of papers.
The visitor nodded a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>"As far as I can gather," he said deliberately, "we are just
above your dressing-room, and if you dropped me through one of
your patent traps, Reale, I should fetch up amongst your
priceless china."</p>

<p>Save for a momentary look of alarm on the old man's face at
the mention of the china, he preserved an imperturbable calm,
never moving his eyes from his visitor's face. Then his grin
returned, and he motioned the other to a chair on the other side
of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned the cushion over with the point of his stick and
sat down.</p>

<p>"Suspicious?" The grin broadened. "Suspicious of your old
friend, Jimmy? The old governor, eh?"</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply for a moment, then&mdash;"You're a
wonder, governor, upon my word you are a wonder. That man in
armour&mdash;your idea?"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head regretfully. "Not mine entirely,
Jimmy. Ye see, there's electricity in it, and I don't know much
about electricity, I never did, except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except?" suggested the visitor.</p>

<p>"Oh, that roulette board, that was my own idea; but that was
magnetism, which is different to electricity, by my way of
looking."</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>"Ye got past the trap?" The old man had just a glint of
admiration in his eye.</p>

<p>"Yes, jumped it."</p>

<p>The old man nodded approvingly. "You always was a one for
thinkin' things out. I've known lots of 'em who would never have
thought of jumping it. Connor, and that pig Massey, they'd have
walked right on to it. You didn't damage anything?" he demanded
suddenly and fiercely. "I heard somethin' break, an' I was
hoping that it was you." Jimmy thought of the marble statue, and
remembered that it had looked valuable.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he lied easily, and the old man's tense
look relaxed.</p>

<p>The pair sat on opposite sides of the fireplace, neither
speaking for fully ten minutes; then Jimmy leant forward.</p>

<p>"Reale," he said quietly, "how much are you worth?"</p>

<p>In no manner disturbed by this leading question, but rather
indicating a lively satisfaction, the other replied instantly:
"Two millions an' a bit over, Jimmy. I've got the figures in my
head. Reckonin' furniture and the things in this house at their
proper value, two millions, and forty-seven thousand and
forty-three pounds&mdash;floatin', Jimmy, absolute cash, the same as
you might put your hand in your pocket an' spend&mdash;a million
an' three&mdash;quarters exact."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair with a triumphant grin and watched
his visitor.</p>

<p>Jimmy had taken a cigarette from his pocket and was lighting
it, looking at the slowly burning match reflectively.</p>

<p>"A million and three-quarters," he repeated calmly, "is a lot
of money."</p>

<p>Old Reale chuckled softly.</p>

<p>"All made out of the confiding public, with the aid of
me&mdash;and Connor and Massey-"</p>

<p>"Massey is a pig!" the old man interjected spitefully.</p>

<p>Jimmy puffed a cloud of tobacco smoke. "Wrung with sweat and
sorrow from foolish young men who backed the tiger and played
high at Reale's Unrivalled Temple of Chance, Cairo,
Egypt&mdash;with branches at Alexandria, Port Said, and
Suez."</p>

<p>The figure in the wadded gown writhed in a paroxysm of silent
merriment.</p>

<p>"How many men have you ruined, Reale?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"The Lord knows," the old man answered cheerfully; "only
three as I knows of&mdash;two of 'em's dead, one of 'em's dying.
The two that's dead left neither chick nor child; the dying
one's got a daughter."</p>

<p>Jimmy eyed him through narrowed lids. "Why this solicitude
for the relatives&mdash;you're not going&mdash;?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, as if anticipating a question, the old man was
nodding his head with feverish energy, and all the while his
grin broadened.</p>

<p>"What a one you are for long words, Jimmy! You always was.
That's how you managed to persuade your swell pals to come an'
try their luck. Solicitude! What's that mean? Frettin' about
'em, d'ye mean? Yes, that's what I'm doin'&mdash;frettin' about
'em. And I'm going to make, what d'ye call it&mdash;you had it
on the tip of your tongue a minute or two ago?"</p>

<p>"Reparation?" suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>Old Reale nodded delightedly.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Don't you ask questions!" bullied the old man, his harsh
voice rising. "I ain't asked you why you broke into my house in
the middle of the night, though I knew it was you who came the
other day to check the electric meter. I saw you, an' I've been
waitin' for you ever since."</p>

<p>"I knew all about that," said Jimmy calmly, and flicked the
ash of his cigarette away with his little finger, "and I thought
you would&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped speaking and listened.</p>

<p>"Who's in the house beside us?" he asked quickly, but the
look on the old man's face reassured him.</p>

<p>"Nobody," said Reale testily. "I've got a special house for
the servants, and they come in every morning after I've unfixed
my burglar-alarms."</p>

<p>He grinned, and then a look of alarm came into his face.</p>

<p>"The alarms!" he whispered; "you broke them when you came in,
Jimmy. I heard the signal. If there's some one in the house we
shouldn't know it now."</p>

<p>They listened. Down below in the hall something creaked, then
the sound of a soft thud came up.</p>

<p>"He's skipped the rug," whispered Jimmy, and switched out the
light. The two men heard a stealthy footstep on the stair, and
waited. There was the momentary glint of a light, and the sound
of some one breathing heavily Jimmy leant over and whispered in
the old man's ear. Then, as the handle of the door was turned
and the door pushed open, Jimmy switched on the light.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a short, thick-set man with a broad, red
face. He wore a check suit of a particularly glaring pattern,
and on the back of his head was stuck a bowler hat, the narrow
brim of which seemed to emphasize the breadth of his face. A
casual observer might have placed him for a coarse,
good&mdash;natured man of rude but boisterous humour. The
ethnological student would have known him at once for what he
was&mdash;a cruel man-beast without capacity for pity.</p>

<p>He started back as the lights went on, blinking a little, but
his hand held an automatic pistol that covered the occupants of
the room.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands," he growled. "Put 'em up!"</p>

<p>Neither man obeyed him. Jimmy was amused and looked it,
stroking his short beard with his white tapering fingers. The
old man was fury incarnate.</p>

<p>He it was that turned to Jimmy and croaked:</p>

<p>"What did I tell ye, Jimmy? What've I always said, Jimmy?
Massey is a pig&mdash;he's got the manners of a pig. Faugh!"</p>

<p>"Put up your hands!" hissed the man with the pistol. "Put 'em
up, or I'll put you both out!"</p>

<p>"If he'd come first, Jimmy!" Old Reale wrung his hands in his
regret. "S'pose he'd jumped the rug&mdash;any sneak thief could
have done that&mdash;d'ye think he'd have spotted the man in
armor? If you'd only get the man in armor ready again."</p>

<p>"Put your pistol down, Massey," said Jimmy coolly, "unless
you want something to play with. Old man Reale's too ill for the
gymnastics you suggest, and I'm not inclined to oblige you."</p>

<p>The man blustered. "By God, if you try any of your monkey
tricks with me, either of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm only a visitor like yourself," said Jimmy, with a
wave of his hand; "and as to monkey tricks, why, I could have
shot you before you entered the room."</p>

<p>Massey frowned, and stood twiddling his pistol.</p>

<p>"You will find a safety catch on the left side of the
barrel," continued Jimmy, pointing to the pistol; "snick it
up&mdash;you can always push it down again with your thumb if
you really mean business. You are not my idea of a burglar. You
breathe too noisily, and you are built too clumsily; why, I
heard you open the front door!"</p>

<p>The quiet contempt in the tone brought a deeper red into the
man's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a clever 'un, we know!" he began, and the old
man, who had recovered his self-command, motioned him to a
chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mister Massey," he snapped; "sit down, my fine
fellow, an' tell us all the news. Jimmy an' me was just speakin'
about you, me an' Jimmy was. We was saying what a fine gentleman
you was"&mdash;his voice grew shrill&mdash;"what a swine, what
an overfed, lumbering fool of a pig you was, Mister Massey!"</p>

<p>He sank back into the depths of his chair exhausted.</p>

<p>"Look here, governor," began Massey again&mdash;he had laid
his pistol on a table by his side, and waved a large red hand to
give point to his remarks&mdash;"we don't want any
unpleasantness. I've been a good friend to you, an' so has
Jimmy. We've done your dirty work for years, me an' Jimmy have,
and Jimmy knows it"&mdash;turning with an ingratiating smirk to
the subject of his remarks&mdash;"and now we want a bit of our
own&mdash;that is all it amounts to, our own."</p>

<p>Old Reale looked under his shaggy eyebrows to where Jimmy sat
with brooding eyes watching the fire.</p>

<p>"So it's a plant, eh? You're both in it. Jimmy comes first,
he being the clever one, an' puts the lay nice an' snug for the
other feller."</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head. "Wrong," he said. He turned his head
and took a long scrutiny of the newcomer, and the amused
contempt of his gaze was too apparent. "Look at him!" he said at
last. "Our dear Massey! Does he look the sort of person I am
likely to share confidence with?"</p>

<p>A cold passion seemed suddenly to possess him.</p>

<p>"It's a coincidence that brought us both together."</p>

<p>He rose and walked to where Massey sat, and stared down at
him. There was something in the look that sent Massey's hand
wandering to his pistol.</p>

<p>"Massey, you dog!" he began, then checked himself with a
laugh and walked to the other end of the room. There was a
tantalus with a soda siphon, and he poured himself a stiff
portion and sent the soda fizzling into the tumbler. He held the
glass to the light and looked at the old man. There was a look
on the old man's face that he remembered to have seen before. He
drank his whisky and gave utterance to old Reale's thoughts.</p>

<p>"It's no good, Reale, you've got to settle with Massey, but
not the way you're thinking. We could put him away, but we
should have to put ourselves away too." He paused. "And there's
me," he added.</p>

<p>"And Connor," said Massey thickly, "and Connor's worse than
me. I'm reasonable, Reale; I'd take a fair share&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would, would you?" The old man was grinning again.
"Well, your share's exactly a million an' three-quarters in
solid cash, an' a bit over two millions&mdash;all in." He paused
to notice the effect of his words. Jimmy's calm annoyed him;
Massey's indifference was outrageous.</p>

<p>"An' it's Jimmy's share, an' Connor's share, an' it's Miss
Kathleen Kent's share." This time the effect was better. Into
Jimmy's inexpressive face had crept a gleam of interest.</p>

<p>"Kent?" he asked quickly. "Wasn't that the name of the
man&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Old Reale chuckled. "The very feller, Jimmy&mdash;the man who
came in to lose a tenner, an' lost ten thousand; who came in
next night to get it back, and left his lot. That's the
feller!"</p>

<p>He rubbed his lean hands, as at the memory of some pleasant
happening.</p>

<p>"Open that cupboard, Jimmy." He pointed to an
old&mdash;fashioned walnut cabinet that stood near the door.
"D'ye see anything&mdash;a thing that looks like a
windmill?"</p>

<p>Jimmy drew out a cardboard structure that was apparently a
toy working-model. He handled it carefully, and deposited it on
the table by the old man's side. Old Reale touched it
caressingly. With his little finger he set a fly&mdash;wheel
spinning, and tiny little pasteboard rods ran to and fro, and
little wooden wheels spun easily.</p>

<p>"That's what I did with his money, invented a noo machine
that went by itself&mdash;perpetual motion. You can grin,
Massey, but that's what I did with it. Five years' work an' a
quarter of a million, that's what that little model means. I
never found the secret out. I could always make a machine that
would go for hours with a little push, but it always wanted the
push. I've been a chap that went in for inventions and puzzles.
D'ye remember the table at Suez?"</p>

<p>He shot a sly glance at the men.</p>

<p>Massey was growing impatient as the reminiscences proceeded.
He had come that night with an object; he had taken a big risk,
and had not lost sight of the fact. Now he broke in&mdash;"Damn
your puzzles, Reale. What about me; never mind about Jimmy.
What's all this rotten talk about two millions for each of us,
and this girl? When you broke up the place in Egypt you said we
should stand in when the time came. Well, the time's come!"</p>

<p>"Nearly, nearly," said Reale, with his death's&mdash;head
grin. "It's nearly come. You needn't have troubled to see me. My
lawyer's got your addresses. I'm nearly through," he went on
cheerfully; "dead I'll be in six months, as sure as&mdash;as
death. Then you fellers will get the money"&mdash;he spoke
slowly to give effect to his words&mdash;"you, Jimmy, or Massey
or Connor or the young lady. You say you don't like puzzles,
Massey? Well, it's a bad look out for you. Jimmy's the clever
un, an' most likely he'll get it; Connor's artful, and he might
get it from Jimmy; but the young lady's got the best chance,
because women are good at puzzles."</p>

<p>"What in hell!" roared Massey, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" It was Jimmy that spoke, and Massey obeyed.</p>

<p>"There's a puzzle about these two millions," Reale went on,
and his croaky voice, with its harsh cockney accent, grew
raucous in his enjoyment of Massey's perplexity and Jimmy's knit
brows. "An' the one that finds the puzzle out, gets the
money."</p>

<p>Had he been less engrossed in his own amusement he would have
seen a change in Massey's brute face that would have warned
him.</p>

<p>"It's in my will," he went on. "I'm goin' to set the sharps
against the flats; the touts of the gamblin' hell&mdash;that's
you two fellers&mdash;against the pigeons. Two of the biggest
pigeons is dead, an' one's dying. Well, he's got a daughter;
let's see what she can do. When I'm dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's now!" bellowed Massey, and leant over and struck the
old man.</p>

<p>Jimmy, on his feet, saw the gush of blood and the knife in
Massey's hand, and reached for his pocket. Massey's pistol
covered him, and the man's face was a dreadful thing to look
upon.</p>

<p>"Hands up! It's God's truth I'll kill you if you don't!"
Jimmy's hands went up.</p>

<p>"He's got the money here," breathed Massey, "somewhere in
this house."</p>

<p>"You're mad," said the other contemptuously. "Why did you hit
him?"</p>

<p>"He sat there makin' a fool of me." The murderer gave a
vicious glance at the inert figure on the floor. "I want
something more than his puzzle-talk. He asked for it."</p>

<p>He backed to the table where the decanter stood, and drank a
tumbler half-filled with raw spirit.</p>

<p>"We're both in this, Jimmy," he said, still keeping his man
covered. "You can put down your hands; no monkey tricks. Give me
your pistol."</p>

<p>Jimmy slipped the weapon from his pocket, and handed it butt
foremost to the man. Then Massey bent over the fallen man and
searched his pockets.</p>

<p>"Here are the keys. You stay here," said Massey, and went
out, closing the door after him. Jimmy heard the grate of the
key, and knew he was a prisoner. He bent over the old man. He
lay motionless. Jimmy tried the pulse, and felt a faint flutter.
Through the clenched teeth he forced a little whisky, and after
a minute the old man's eyes opened.</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" he whispered; then remembering, "Where's Massey?" he
asked. There was no need to inquire the whereabouts of Massey.
His blundering footfalls sounded in the room above.</p>

<p>"Lookin' for money?" gasped the old man, and something like a
smile crossed his face. "Safe's up there," he whispered, and
smiled again. "Got the keys?"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. The old man's eyes wandered round the room till
they rested on what looked like a switchboard.</p>

<p>"See that handle marked 'seven'?" he whispered. Jimmy nodded
again. "Pull it down, Jimmy boy." His voice was growing fainter.
"This is a new one that I read in a book. Pull it down."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," the lips motioned, and Jimmy walked
across the room and pulled over the insulated lever.</p>

<p>As he did there was a heavy thud overhead that shook the
room, and then silence.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked sharply. The dying man smiled.</p>

<p>"That's Massey!" said the lips.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Jimmy left the house with a soiled slip of
paper in his waistcoat pocket, on which was written the most
precious verse of doggerel that the world has known. And the
discovery of the two dead men in the upper chambers the next
morning afforded the evening press the sensation of the
year.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; ANGEL ESQUIRE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Nobody quite knows how Angel Esquire came to
occupy the position he does at Scotland Yard. On his
appointment, "An Officer of Twenty Years' Standing" wrote to the
Police Review and characterized the whole thing as "a job."</p>

<p>Probably it was. For Angel Esquire had been many things in
his short but useful career, but never a policeman. He had been
a big game shot, a special correspondent, a "scratch"
magistrate, and his nearest approach to occupying a responsible
position in any police force in the world was when he was
appointed a J.P. of Rhodesia, and, serving on the Tuli
Commission, he hanged M'Linchwe and six of that black
desperado's companions.</p>

<p>His circle of acquaintances extended to the suburbs of
London, and the suburbanites, who love you to make their flesh
creep, would sit in shivering but pleasurable horror whilst
Angel Esquire elaborated the story of the execution.</p>

<p>In Mayfair Angel Esquire was best known as a successful
mediator.</p>

<p>"Who is that old-looking young man with the wicked eye?"
asked the Dowager Duchess of Hoeburn; and her vis-a-vis at the
Honorable Mrs. Carter-Walker's "sit-down tea"&mdash;it was in
the days when Mayfair was aping suburbia&mdash;put up his
altogether unnecessary eyeglass.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Angel Esquire!" he said carelessly. "What is he?"
asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>"A policeman."</p>

<p>"India?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said Her Grace in a shocked voice. "How very
dreadful! What is he doing? Watching the guests, or keeping a
friendly eye on the Carter woman's spoons?"</p>

<p>The young man guffawed. "Don't despise old Angel, Duchess,"
he said. "He's a man to know. Great fellow for putting things
right. If you have a row with your governor, or get into the
hands of&mdash;er&mdash;undesirables, or generally, if you're in
a mess of any kind, Angel's the chap to pull you out."</p>

<p>Her Grace surveyed the admirable man with a new interest.</p>

<p>Angel Esquire, with a cup of tea in one hand und a thin grass
sandwich in the other, was the centre of a group of men,
including the husband of the hostess. He was talking with some
animation.</p>

<p>"I held three aces pat, and opened the pot light to let 'em
in. Young Saville raised the opening a tenner, and the dealer
went ten better. George Manfred, who had passed, came in for a
pony, and took one card. I took two, and drew another ace.
Saville took one, and the dealer stood pat. I thought it was my
money, and bet a pony. Saville raised it to fifty, the dealer
made it a hundred, and George Manfred doubled the bet. It was up
to me. I had four aces; I put Saville with a 'full,' and the
dealer with a 'flush.' I had the beating of that lot; but what
about Manfred? Manfred is a feller with all the sense going. He
knew what the others had. If he bet, he had the goods, so I
chucked my four aces into the discard. George had a straight
flush."</p>

<p>A chorus of approval came from the group. If "An Officer of
Twenty Years' Standing" had been a listener, he might well have
been further strengthened in his opinion that of all persons Mr.
Angel was least fitted to fill the responsible position he
did.</p>

<p>If the truth be told, nobody quite knew exactly what position
Angel did hold.</p>

<p>If you turn into New Scotland Yard and ask the janitor at the
door for Mr. Christopher Angel&mdash;Angel Esquire by the way
was a nickname affixed by a pert little girl&mdash;the
constable, having satisfied himself as to your bona fides, would
take you up a flight of stairs and hand you over to yet another
officer, who would conduct you through innumerable swing doors,
and along uncounted corridors till he stopped before a portal
inscribed "647." Within, you would find Angel Esquire sitting at
his desk, doing nothing, with the aid of a Sporting Life and a
small weekly guide to the Turf.</p>

<p>Once Mr. Commissioner himself walked into the room
unannounced, and found Angel so immersed in an elaborate
calculation, with big sheets of paper closely filled with
figures, and open books on either hand, that he did not hear his
visitor.</p>

<p>"What is the problem?" asked Mr. Commissioner, and Angel
looked up with his sweetest smile, and recognizing his visitor,
rose.</p>

<p>"What's the problem?" asked Mr. Commissioner again.</p>

<p>"A serious flaw, sir," said Angel, with all gravity. "Here's
Mimosa handicapped at seven stone nine in the Friary Nursery,
when, according to my calculations, she can give the field a
stone, and beat any one of 'em."</p>

<p>The Commissioner gasped. "My dear fellow," he expostulated,
"I thought you were working on the Lagos Bank business."</p>

<p>Angel had a far-away look in his eyes when he
answered&mdash;"Oh, that is all finished. Old Carby was poisoned
by a man named&mdash;forget his name now, but he was a
Monrovian. I wired the Lagos police, and we caught the chap this
morning at Liverpool&mdash;took him off an Elder, Dempster
boat."</p>

<p>The Police Commissioner beamed. "My congratulations, Angel.
By Jove, I thought we shouldn't have a chance of helping the
people in Africa. Is there a white man in it?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," said Angel absently his eye was wandering up
and down a column of figures on the paper before him. "I am
inclined to fancy there is&mdash;man named Connor, who used to
be a croupier or something to old Reale."</p>

<p>He frowned at the paper, and picking up a pencil from the
desk, made a rapid little calculation.</p>

<p>"Seven stone thirteen," he muttered.</p>

<p>The Commissioner tapped the table impatiently. He had sunk
into a seat opposite Angel.</p>

<p>"My dear man, who is old Reale? You forget that you are our
tame foreign specialist. Lord, Angel, if you heard half the
horrid things that people say about your appointment you would
die of shame!"</p>

<p>Angel pushed aside the papers with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm beyond shame," he said light-heartedly; "and, besides,
I've heard, you were asking about Reale. Reale is a character.
For twenty years proprietor of one of the most delightful
gambling plants in Egypt, Rome&mdash;goodness knows where.
Education&mdash;none. Hobbies&mdash;invention. That's the 'bee
in his bonnet'&mdash;invention. If he's got another, it is the
common or garden puzzle. Pigs in clover, missing words, all the
fake competitions that cheap little papers run&mdash;he goes in
for them all. Lives at 43 Terrington Square."</p>

<p>"Where?" The Commissioner's eyebrows rose. "Reale? 43
Terrington Square? Why, of course."</p>

<p>He looked at Angel queerly. "You know all about Reale?"</p>

<p>Angel shrugged his shoulders: "As much as anybody knows," he
said.</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded. "Well, take a cab and get down at
once to 43 Terrington Square: Your old Reale was murdered last
night."</p>

<p>It was peculiar of Angel Esquire that nothing surprised him.
He received the most tremendous tidings with polite interest,
and now he merely said, "Dear me!"</p>

<p>Later, as a swift hansom carried him along Whitehall he
permitted himself to be "blessed."</p>

<p>Outside No. 43 Terrington Square a small crowd of morbid
sightseers stood in gloomy anticipation of some gruesome
experience or other.</p>

<p>A policeman admitted him, and the local inspector stopped in
his interrogation of a white-faced butler bid him a curt "Good
morning." Angel's preliminary inspection did not take any time.
He saw the bodies, which had not yet been removed. He examined
the pockets of both men, and ran his eye through the scattered
papers on the floor of the room in which the tragedy had
occurred. Then he came back to the big drawing-room and saw the
inspector, who was sitting at a table writing his report.</p>

<p>"The chap on the top floor committed the murder, of course,"
said Angel.</p>

<p>"I know that," said Inspector Boyden brusquely.</p>

<p>"And was electrocuted by a current passing through the handle
of the safe."</p>

<p>"I gathered that," the inspector replied as before, and went
on with his work.</p>

<p>"The murderer's name is Massey," continued Angel patiently,
"George Charles Massey."</p>

<p>The inspector turned in his seat with a sarcastic smile. "I
also," he said pointedly, "have seen the envelopes addressed in
that name, which were found in his pocket."</p>

<p>Angel's face was preternaturally solemn as he
continued&mdash;"The third man I am not so sure about."</p>

<p>The inspector looked up suspiciously. "Third man&mdash;which
third man?"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;simulated astonishment sent Angel's eye-brows to
the shape of inverted V's.</p>

<p>"There was another man in it. Didn't you know that, Mr.
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"I have found no evidence of the presence of a third party,"
he said stiffly; "but I have not yet concluded my
investigations."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Angel cheerfully. "When you have, you will find
the ends of three cigarettes&mdash;two in the room where the old
man was killed, and one in the safe room. They are marked 'Al
Kam,' and are a fairly expensive variety of Egyptian cigarettes.
Massey smoked cigars; old Reale did not smoke at all. The
question is"&mdash;he went on speaking aloud to himself, and
ignoring the perplexed police official&mdash;"was it Connor or
was it Jimmy?"</p>

<p>The inspector struggled with a desire to satisfy his
curiosity at the expense of his dignity, and resolved to
maintain an attitude of superior incredulity.</p>

<p>He turned back to his work.</p>

<p>"It would be jolly difficult to implicate either of them,"
Angel went on reflectively, addressing the back of the
inspector. "They would produce fifty unimpeachable alibis, and
bring an action for wrongful arrest in addition," he added
artfully.</p>

<p>"They can't do that," said the inspector gruffly.</p>

<p>"Can't they?" asked the innocent Angel. "Well, at any rate,
it's not advisable to arrest them. Jimmy would&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Boyden swung round in his chair. "I don't know
whether you're 'pulling my leg,' Mr. Angel. You are perhaps
unused to the procedure in criminal cases in London, and I must
now inform you that at present I am in charge of the ease, and
must request that if you have any information bearing upon this
crime to give it to me at once."</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in life," said Angel heartily. "In the
first place, Jimmy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Full name, please." The inspector dipped his pen in ink.</p>

<p>"Haven't the slightest idea," said the other carelessly.
"Everybody knows Jimmy. He was old Reale's most successful decoy
duck. Had the presence and the plumage and looked alive, so that
all the other little ducks used to come flying down and settle
about him, and long before they could discover that the
beautiful bird that attracted them was only painted wood and
feathers, 'Bang! bang!' went old Reale's double-barrel, and
roast duck was on the menu for days on end."</p>

<p>Inspector Boyden threw down his pen with a grunt. "I'm
afraid," he said in despair, "that I cannot include your parable
in my report. When you have any definite information to give, I
shall be pleased to receive it."</p>

<p>Later, at Scotland Yard, Angel interviewed the Commissioner.
"What sort of a man is Boyden to work with?" asked Mr.
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"A most excellent chap&mdash;good-natured, obliging, and as
zealous as the best of 'em," said Angel, which was his way.</p>

<p>"I shall leave him in charge of the case," said the
Chief.</p>

<p>"You couldn't do better," said Angel decisively.</p>

<p>Then he went home to his flat in Jermyn Street to dress for
dinner. It was an immaculate Angel Esquire who pushed through
the plate-glass, turn-table door of the Heinz, and, walking into
the magnificent old rose dining-room, selected a table near a
window looking out on to Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The other occupant of the table looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Angel!" he said easily.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jimmy!" greeted the unconventional detective. He took
up the card and chose his dishes with elaborate care. A
half-bottle of Beaujolais completed his order.</p>

<p>"The ridiculous thing is that one has got to pay 7s. 6d. for
a small bottle of wine that any respectable grocer will sell you
for tenpence ha'penny net."</p>

<p>"You must pay for the magnificence," said the other, quietly
amused. Then, after the briefest pause, "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Not you, Jimmy," said the amiable Angel, "though my young
friend, Boyden, Inspector of Police, and a Past Chief Templar to
boot, will be looking for you shortly."</p>

<p>Jimmy carefully chose a toothpick and stripped it of its
tissue covering.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said quietly, "I wasn't in it&mdash;the
killing, I mean. I was there."</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said Angel; "saw your foolish
cigarettes. I didn't think you had any hand in the killing. You
are a property criminal, not a personal criminal."</p>

<p>"By which I gather you convey the nice distinction as between
crimes against property and crimes against the person," said the
other.</p>

<p>"Exactly." A pause. "Well?" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"What I want to see you about is the verse," said Angel,
stirring his soup.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed aloud. "What a clever little devil you are,
Angel," he said admiringly; "and not so little either, in inches
or devilishness."</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence, and the wrinkled forehead was
eloquent.</p>

<p>"Think hard," taunted Angel.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking," said Jimmy slowly. "I used a pencil, as there
was no blotting paper. I only made one copy, just as the old man
dictated it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You used a block," said Angel obligingly, "and only tore off
the top sheet. And you pressed rather heavily on that, so that
the next sheet bore a legible impression."</p>

<p>Jimmy looked annoyed. "What an ass I am!" he said, and was
again silent.</p>

<p>"The verse?" said Angel. "Can you make head or tail of
it?"</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;Jimmy shook his head&mdash;"can you?"</p>

<p>"Not a blessed thing," Angel frankly confessed.</p>

<p>Through the next three courses neither man spoke. When coffee
had been placed on the table, Jimmy broke the silence&mdash;"You
need not worry about the verse. I have only stolen a march of a
few days. Then Connor will have it; and some girl or other will
have it. Massey would have had it too." He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?"</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at his questioner with some suspicion. "Don't
you know?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Haven't got the slightest notion. That is why I came to see
you."</p>

<p>"Curious!" mused Jimmy. "I thought of looking you up for the
very same purpose. We'll all know in a day or two," he went on,
beckoning the waiter.</p>

<p>"The old man said it was all in the will. He just told me the
verse before he died. The ruling passion, don't you know. 'Learn
it by heart, Jimmy,' he croaked; 'it's two millions for you if
you guess it' '-and that's how he died. My bill, waiter. Which
way do you go?" he asked as they turned into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>"To the 'Plait' for an hour," said Angel.</p>

<p>"Business?"</p>

<p>"Partly; I'm looking for a man who might be there."</p>

<p>They crossed Piccadilly, and entered a side turning. The
second on the left and the first on the right brought them
opposite a brightly-lit hotel. From within came the sound of
violins. At the little tables with which the spacious bar-room
was set about sat laughing women and young men in evening dress.
A haze of cigarette smoke clouded the atmosphere, and the music
made itself heard above a babel of laughter and talk. They found
a corner, and seated themselves.</p>

<p>"You seem to be fairly well known here," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Angel ruefully, "a jolly sight too well known.
You're not quite a stranger, Jimmy," he added.</p>

<p>"No," said the other a little bitterly; "but we're on
different sides of the House, Angel. You're in the Cabinet, and
I'm in the everlasting Opposition."</p>

<p>"Muffled sobs!" said Angel flippantly. "Pity poor Ishmael who
'ishes' for his own pleasure! Pathos for a fallen brother! A
silent tear for this magnificent wreck who'd rather be on the
rocks than floating any day of the week. Don't humbug yourself,
Jimmy, or I shall be falling on your neck and appealing to your
better nature. You're a thief just as another man is a stamp
collector or a hunter. It's your blooming forte. Hi, Charles, do
you ever intend serving me?"</p>

<p>"Yessir; d'reckly, sir" Charles bustled up. "What is it to
be, gentlemen? Good evening, Mr. Angel!"</p>

<p>"I'll take what my friend Dooley calls a keg of obscenth; and
you?"</p>

<p>Jimmy's face struggled to preserve its gravity. "Lemonade,"
he said soberly. The waiter brought him a whisky. If you do not
know the "Plait" you do not know your London. It is one of the
queer hostels which in a Continental city would be noted as a
place to which the "young person" might not be taken. Being in
London, neither Baedeker nor any of the infallible guides to the
metropolis so much as mention its name. For there is a law of
libel.</p>

<p>"There's 'Snatch' Walker," said Angel idly. "Snatch isn't
wanted just now&mdash;in this country. There's 'Frisco Kate,'
who'll get a lifer one of these days. D'ye know the boy in the
mustard suit, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>Jimmy took a sidelong glance at the young man. "No; he's
new."</p>

<p>"Not so new either," said Angel. "Budapest in the racing
season, Jerusalem in the tourist season; a wealthy Hungarian
nobleman travelling for his health all the time&mdash;that's
him."</p>

<p>"Ambiguous, ungrammatical, but convincing," murmured
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I want him, by the way!" Angel had suddenly become
alert.</p>

<p>"If you're going to have a row, I'm off," said Jimmy,
finishing his drink.</p>

<p>Angel caught his arm. A man had entered the saloon, and was
looking round as though in search of somebody. He caught Jimmy's
eye and started. Then he threaded his way through the crowded
room.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jim&mdash;'" He stopped dead as he saw Jimmy's
companion, and his hand went into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Connor!" Angel's smile was particularly disarming.
"You're the man I want to see."</p>

<p>"What's the game?" the other snarled. He was a big,
heavily-built man, with a drooping moustache.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," smiled Angel. "I want you for the Lagos
job, but there's not enough evidence to convict you. Make your
mind easy."</p>

<p>The man went white under his tan; his hand caught the edge of
the table before him. "Lagos!" he stammered.
"What&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about that." Angel airily waved the matter
aside. "Sit down here."</p>

<p>The man hesitated, then obeyed, and dropped into a seat
between the two. Angel looked round. So far as any danger of
being overheard went, they were as much' alone as though they
sat in the centre of a desert.</p>

<p>"Jimmy"&mdash;Angel held him by the arm&mdash;"you said just
now you'd got a march when you admitted you'd seen old Reale's
puzzle verse. It wasn't the march you thought it was, for I had
seen the will&mdash;and so has Connor here."</p>

<p>He looked the heavy man straight in the eye. "There is
somebody else that benefits under that will besides you two. It
is a girl."</p>

<p>He did not take his eyes from Connor. "I was curious to see
that young lady," Angel went on, "and this afternoon I drove to
CIapham to interview her." He stopped again. Connor made no
reply, but kept his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>"I went to interview her, and found that she had mysteriously
disappeared this very afternoon." Again he stopped. "A gentleman
called to see her, with a message from&mdash;who do you think,
Connor?" he asked.</p>

<p>The easy, flippant manner was gone, and Connor looking up,
caught the steady stare of two wild blue eyes, and shivered.</p>

<p>"Why," Angel went on slowly, "it was a message from Inspector
Angel&mdash;which is a damned piece of impudence, Connor, for
I'm not an inspector&mdash;and the young lady drove away to
Scotland Yard. And now, Connor, I want to ask you, What have you
done with old Reale's heiress?"</p>

<p>Connor licked his lips and said nothing.</p>

<p>Angel beckoned to a waiter and paid his score, then rose to
go.</p>

<p>"You will go at once and drive Miss Kathleen Kent back to the
place you took her from. I shall call tomorrow and see her, and
if one hair of her head is harmed, Connor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Connor defiantly.</p>

<p>"I'll chance your alibis, and take you for the Lagos
business," and with a curt nod to Jimmy, he left the saloon.</p>

<p>Connor turned in a fret of fury to the man at his side. "D'ye
hear him, Jimmy? D'ye hear the dog&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My advice to you," interrupted the other, "is&mdash;do as
Angel tells you."</p>

<p>"D'ye think I'm frightened by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the quiet response, "you are not frightened at
what Angel may do. What he does won't matter very much. What I
will do is the trouble."</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE "BOROUGH
LOT"</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was not a bit like Scotland Yard as Kathleen
Kent had pictured it. It was a kind of a yard certainly, for the
grimy little street, flanked on either side with the blank faces
of dirty little houses, ended abruptly in a high wall, over
which were the gray hulls and fat scarlet funnels of ocean-going
steamers. The driver of the cab had pulled up before one of the
houses near the wall, and a door had opened. Then the man who
had sat with her in glum silence, answering her questions in
monosyllables, grasped her arm and hurried her into the house.
The door slammed behind, and she realized her deadly peril.</p>

<p>She had had a foreboding, an instinctive premonition that all
was not well when the cab had turned from the broad thoroughfare
that led to where she had imagined Scotland Yard would be, and
had, taking short cuts through innumerable mean streets, moved
at a sharp pace eastward. Ignorant of that London which begins
at Trafalgar Square and runs eastward to Walthamstow, ignorant,
indeed, of that practical suburb to which the modesty of an
income produced by 4,000 pounds worth of Consols had relegated
her, she felt without knowing, that Scotland Yard did not lie at
the eastern end of Commercial Road. Then when the door of the
little house slammed and a hand grasped her arm tightly, and a
thick voice whispered in her ear that if she screamed the owner
of the voice would "out" her, she gathered, without exactly
knowing what an "outing" was, that it would be wiser for her not
to scream, so she quietly accompanied her captor up the stairs.
He stopped for a moment on the rickety landing, then pushed open
a door. Before the window that would in the ordinary course of
events admit the light of day hung a heavy green curtain; behind
this, though she did not know it, three army blankets,
judiciously fixed, effectively excluded the sunlight, and as
effectually veiled the rays of a swing-lamp from outside
observation.</p>

<p>The girl made a pathetically incongruous figure, as she stood
white, but resolute before the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Kathleen Kent was something more than pretty, something less
than beautiful. An oval face with gray, steadfast eyes, a
straight nose and the narrow upper lip of the aristocrat, her
lips were, perhaps, too full and too human for your connoisseur
of beauty.</p>

<p>She looked from face to face, and but for her pallor she
exhibited no sign of fear. Although she was unaware of the fact,
she had been afforded an extraordinary privilege. By the merest
accident, she had been ushered into the presence of the "Borough
Lot." Not a very heroic title for an organized band of
criminals, but, then, organized criminals never take unto
themselves generic and high-falutin' titles. Our "Silver
Hatchets" and "Red Knives" are boy hooligans who shoot off toy
pistols. The police referred to them vaguely as the "Borough
Lot". Lesser lights in the criminal world have been known to
boast that they were not unconnected with that combination; and
when some desperate piece of villainy startled the world, the
police investigating the crime started from this point: Was it
committed by one of the Borough Lot, or was it not?</p>

<p>As Kathleen was pushed into the room by her captor, a hum of
subdued conversation ended abruptly, and she was the focus of
nine pairs of passionless eyes that looked at her unsmilingly.
When she had heard the voices, when she took her first swift
glance at the room, and had seen the type of face that met hers,
she had steeled herself for an outburst of coarse amusement. She
feared&mdash;she did not know what she feared. Strangely enough,
the dead silence that greeted her gave her courage, the cold
stare of the men nerved her. Only one of the men lost his
composure. The tall, heavy-looking man who sat at one end of the
room with bowed, attentive head listening to a little clean-shaven
man with side-whiskers, who looked for all the world like
an old-fashioned jockey, started with a muttered oath.</p>

<p>"Upstairs!" he roared, and said something rapidly in a
foreign tongue that sent the man who held the girl's arm
staggering back with a blanched face. "I... I..." he stammered
appealingly, "I didn't understand."</p>

<p>The tall man, his face flushed with rage, pointed to the
door, and hastily opening the door, her captor half dragged the
bewildered girl to the darkness of the landing.</p>

<p>"This way," he muttered, and she could feel his hand
trembling as he stumbled up yet another flight of stairs, never
once relinquishing his hold of her.</p>

<p>"Don't you scream nor nothing, or you'll get into trouble.
You see what happened to me for takin' you into the wrong room.
Oh, he's a devil is Connor&mdash;Smith, I mean. Smith's his
name, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>He shook her arm roughly. Evidently the man was beside
himself with terror. What dreadful thing the tall man had said,
Kathleen could only judge. She herself was half dead with
fright. The sinister faces of these men, the mystery of this
assembly in the shuttered room, her abduction, all combined to
add terror to her position.</p>

<p>Her conductor unlocked a door and pushed her in. This had
evidently been prepared for her reception, for a table had been
laid, and food and drink stood ready. The door was closed behind
her, and a bolt was slipped. Like the chamber below, all
daylight was kept out by a curtain. Her first thoughts were of
escape.</p>

<p>She waited till the footsteps on the rickety stairs had died
away, then crossed the room swiftly. The drop from the window
could not be very far; she would risk it. She drew aside the
curtain. Where the window should have been was a sheet of steel
plate. It was screwed to the joists. Somebody had anticipated
her resolve to escape by the window. In chalk, written in an
illiterate hand, was the sentence:</p>

<p>"You wont be hert if your senserble. We want to know some
questions then well let you go. Don't make a fuss or it will be
bad for you. Keep quite and tell us these questions and well let
you go."</p>

<p>What had they to ask, or she to answer? She knew of nothing
that she could inform them upon. Who were these men who were
detaining her? During the next hours she asked herself these
questions over and over again. She grew faint with hunger and
thirst, but the viands spread upon the table she did not touch.
The mystery of her capture bewildered her. Of what value was she
to these men? All the time the murmur of voices in the room
below was continuous. Once or twice she heard a voice raised in
anger. Once a door slammed, and somebody went clattering down
the stairs. There was a doorkeeper, she could hear him speak
with the outgoer.</p>

<p>Did she but know it, the question that perplexed her was an
equal matter of perplexity with others in the house that
evening. The notorious men upon whom she had looked, all
innocent of their claim to notoriety, were themselves puzzled.
Bat Sands, the man who looked so ill&mdash;he had the unhealthy
appearance of one who had just come through a long
sickness&mdash;was an inquirer, Vinnis&mdash;nobody knew his
Christian name&mdash;was another, and they were two men whose
inquiries were not to be put off.</p>

<p>Vinnis turned his dull fish eyes upon big Connor, and spoke
with deliberation. "Connor, what's this girl business? Are we in
it?"</p>

<p>Connor knew his men too well to temporize. "You're in it, if
it's worth anything," he said slowly.</p>

<p>Bat's close-cropped red head was thrust forward. "Is there
money in it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Connor nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Much?" Connor drew a deep breath. If the truth be told, that
the "Lot" should share, was the last thing he had intended. But
for the blundering of his agent, they would have remained in
ignorance of the girl's presence in the house. But the very
suspicion of disloyalty was dangerous. He knew his men, and they
knew him. There was not a man there who would hesitate to
destroy him at the merest hint of treachery. Candour was the
best and safest course.</p>

<p>"It's pretty hard to give you any idea what I've got the girl
here for, but there's a million in it," he began.</p>

<p>He knew they believed him. He did not expect to be
disbelieved. Criminals of the class these men represented flew
high. They were out of the ruck of petty, boasting sneak-thieves
who lied to one another, knowing they lied, and knowing that
their hearers knew they lied. Only the strained, intent look on
their faces gave any indication of how the news had been
received.</p>

<p>"It's old Reale's money," he continued; "he's left the lot to
four of us, Massey's dead, so that makes three." There was no
need to explain who was Reale, who Massey. A week ago Massey had
himself sat in that room and discussed with Connor the cryptic
verse that played so strange a part in the old man's will. He
had been, in a way, an honorary member of the "Borough Lot."</p>

<p>Connor continued. He spoke slowly, waiting for inspiration. A
judicious lie might save the situation. But no inspiration came,
and he found his reluctant tongue speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"The money is stored in one safe. Oh, it's no use looking
like that, Tony, you might just as well try to crack the Bank of
England as that crib. Yes, he converted every cent of a million
and three-quarters into hard, solid cash&mdash;banknotes and
gold. This he put into his damned safe, and locked. And he has
left by the terms of his will a key."</p>

<p>Connor was a man who did not find speaking an easy matter.
Every word came slowly and hesitatingly, as though the speaker
of the story were loth to part with it.</p>

<p>"The key is here," he said slowly. There was a rustle of
eager anticipation as he dipped his hand in his waistcoat
pocket. When he withdrew his fingers, they contained only a slip
of paper carefully folded.</p>

<p>"The lock of the safe is one of Reale's inventions; it opens
to no key save this."</p>

<p>He hook the paper before them, then lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"Well," broke in Bat impatiently, "why don't you open the
safe? And what has the girl to do with it?"</p>

<p>"She also has a key, or will have tomorrow. And Jimmy..."</p>

<p>A laugh interrupted him. "Curt" Goyle had been an attentive
listener till Jimmy's name was mentioned, then his harsh,
mirthless laugh broke the tense silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord James is in it, is he? I'm one that's for ruling
Jimmy out."</p>

<p>He got up on his feet and stretched himself, keeping his eye
fixed on Connor.</p>

<p>"If you want to know why, I'll tell ye. Jimmy's a bit too
finicking for my taste, too fond of the police for my taste. If
we're in this, Jimmy's out of it," and a mutter of approval
broke from the men.</p>

<p>Connor's mind was working quickly. He could do without Jimmy,
he could not dispense with the help of the "Lot." He was just a
little afraid of Jimmy. The man was a type of criminal he could
not understand. If he was a rival claimant for Reale's millions,
the gang would "out" Jimmy; so much the better. Massey's removal
had limited the legatees to three. Jimmy out of the way would
narrow the chance of his losing the money still further; and the
other legatee was in the room upstairs. Goyle's declaration had
set loose the tongues of the men, and he could hear no voice
that spoke for Jimmy. And then a dozen voices demanded the rest
of the story, and amid a dead silence Connor told the story of
the will and the puzzle-verse, the solving of which meant
fortune to every man.</p>

<p>"And the girl has got to stand in and take her share. She's
too dangerous to be let loose. There's nigh on two millions at
stake and I'm taking no risks. She shall remain here till the
word is found. We're not going to see her carry off the money
under our very noses."</p>

<p>"And Jimmy?" Goyle asked.</p>

<p>Connor fingered a lapel of his coat nervously. He knew what
answer the gang had already framed to the question Goyle put. He
knew he would be asked to acquiesce in the blackest piece of
treachery that had ever disfigured his evil life; but he knew,
too, that Jimmy was hated by the men who formed this strange
fraternity. Jimmy worked alone; he shared neither risk nor
reward. His cold cynicism was above their heads. They too feared
him.</p>

<p>Connor cleared his throat. "Perhaps if we
reasoned&mdash;"</p>

<p>Goyle and Bat exchanged swift glances. "Ask him to come and
talk it over tonight," said Goyle carelessly.</p>

<p>"Connor is a long time gone." Sands turned his unhealthy face
to the company as he spoke. Three hours had passed since Connor
had left the gang in his search for Jimmy.</p>

<p>"He'll be back soon," said Goyle confidently. He looked over
the assembly of men. "Any of you fellers who don't want to be in
this business can go."</p>

<p>Then he added significantly, "We're going to settle with
Jimmy."</p>

<p>Nobody moved; no man shuddered at the dreadful suggestion his
words conveyed. "A million an' three-quarters&mdash;it's worth
hanging for!" he said callously.</p>

<p>He walked to a tall, narrow cupboard that ran up by the side
of the fireplace and pulled open the door. There was room for a
man to stand inside. The scrutiny of the interior gave him some
satisfaction. "This is where some one stood"&mdash;he looked
meaningly at Bat Sand&mdash;"when he coshed Ike Steen&mdash;Ike
with the police money in his pocket, and ready to sell every man
jack of you."</p>

<p>"Who's in the next house?" a voice asked suddenly. Goyle
laughed. He was the virtual landlord so far as the hiring of the
house was concerned. He closed the cupboard door. "Not counting
old George, it's empty," he said. "Listen!"</p>

<p>In the deep silence there came the faint murmur of a voice
through the thin walls. "Talkin' to himself," said Goyle with a
grin; "he's daft, and he's as good as a watchman for us, for he
scares away the children and women who would come prying about
here. He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>They heard the front door shut quickly and the voices of two
men in the passage below.</p>

<p>Goyle sprang to his feet, an evil look on his face. "That's
Jimmy!" he whispered hurriedly. As the feet sounded on the
stairs he walked to where his coat hung and took something from
his pocket, then, almost as the newcomers entered the room, he
slipped into the cupboard and drew the door close after him.</p>

<p>Jimmy entering the room in Connor's wake, felt the chill of
his reception. He felt, too, some indefinable sensation of
danger. There was an ominous quiet. Bat Sands was polite, even
servile. Jimmy noticed that, and his every sense became alert.
Bat thrust forward a chair and placed it with its back toward
the cupboard.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Jimmy," he said with forced heartiness. "We want a
bit of a talk."</p>

<p>Jimmy sat down. "I also want a bit of a talk," he said
calmly. "There is a young lady in this house, brought here
against her will. You've got to let her go."</p>

<p>The angry mutter of protest that he had expected did not
come, rather was his dictum received in complete silence. This
was bad, and he looked round for the danger. Then he missed a
face.</p>

<p>"Where is our friend Goyle, our dear landlord?" he asked with
pleasant irony.</p>

<p>"He hasn't been here today," Bat hastened to say.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at Connor standing by the door biting his nails,
and Connor avoided his eye.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Jimmy's unconcern was perfectly simulated.</p>

<p>"Jimmy wants us to send the girl back." Connor was speaking
hurriedly. "He thinks there'll be trouble, and his friend the
'tec thinks there will be trouble too."</p>

<p>Jimmy heard the artfully-worded indictment unmoved. Again he
noticed, with some concern, that what was tantamount to a charge
of treachery was received without a word.</p>

<p>"It isn't what others think, it is what I think, Connor," he
said dryly. "The girl has got to go back. I want Reale's money
as much as you, but I have a fancy to play fair this
journey."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have, have you," sneered Connor. He had seen the
cupboard door behind Jimmy move ever so slightly. Jimmy sat with
his legs crossed on the chair that had been placed for him. The
light overcoat he had worn over his evening dress lay across his
knees. Connor knew the moment was at hand, and concentrated his
efforts to keep his former comrade's attentions engaged. He had
guessed the meaning of Goyle's absence from the room and the
moving cupboard door. In his present position Jimmy was
helpless. Connor had been nervous to a point of incoherence on
the way to the house.</p>

<p>Now his voice rose to a strident pitch.</p>

<p>"You're too clever, Jimmy," he said, "and there are too many
'musts' about you to please us. We say that the girl has got to
stay, and by&mdash;we mean it!"</p>

<p>Jimmy's wits were at work. The danger was very close at hand,
he felt that. He must change his tactics. He had depended too
implicitly upon Connor's fear of him, and had reckoned without
the "Borough Lot".</p>

<p>From which of these men did danger threaten? He took their
faces in in one comprehensive glance. He knew them&mdash;he had
their black histories at his fingertips. Then he saw a coat
hanging on the wall at the farther end of the room. He
recognized the garment instantly. It was Goyle's. Where was the
owner? He temporized.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest desire to upset anybody's plans," he
drawled, and started drawing on a white glove, as though about
to depart. "I am willing to hear your views, but I would point
out that I have an equal interest in the young lady,
Connor."</p>

<p>He gazed reflectively into the palm of his gloved hand as if
admiring the fit. There was something so peculiar in this
apparently innocent action, that Connor started forward with an
oath.</p>

<p>"Quick, Goyle!" he shouted; but Jimmy was out of his chair
and was standing with his back against the cupboard, and in
Jimmy's ungloved hand was an ugly black weapon that was all butt
and barrel.</p>

<p>He waved them back, and they shrank away from him.</p>

<p>"Let me see you all," he commanded, "none of your getting
behind one another. I want to see what you are doing. Get away
from that coat of yours, Bat, or I'll put a bullet in your
stomach."</p>

<p>He had braced himself against the door in anticipation of the
thrust of the man, but it seemed as though the prisoner inside
had accepted the situation, for he made no sign.</p>

<p>"So you are all wondering how I knew about the cupboard," he
jeered. He held up the gloved hand, and in the palm something
flashed back the light of the lamp. Connor knew. The tiny mirror
sewn in the palm of the sharper's glove was recognized
equipment.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said Jimmy with a mocking laugh, "I must
insist on having my way. Connor, you will please bring to me the
lady you abducted this afternoon."</p>

<p>Connor hesitated; then he intercepted a glance from Bat
Sands, and sullenly withdrew from the room. Jimmy did not speak
till Connor had returned ushering in the white-faced girl. He
saw that she looked faint and ill, and motioned one of the men
to place a chair for her.</p>

<p>What she saw amidst that forbidding group was a young man
with a little Vandyke beard, who looked at her with grave,
thoughtful eyes. He was a gentleman, she could see that, and her
heart leapt within her as she realized that the presence of this
man in the fashionably-cut clothes and the most unfashionable
pistol meant deliverance from this horrible place.</p>

<p>"Miss Kent," he said kindly.</p>

<p>She nodded, she could not trust herself to speak. The
experience of the past few hours had almost reduced her to a
state of collapse. Jimmy saw the girl was on the verge of a
breakdown.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you home," he said, and added
whimsically, "and cannot but feel that you have underrated your
opportunities. Not often will you see gathered together so
splendid a collection of our profession."</p>

<p>He waved his hand in introduction. "Bat Sands, Miss Kent, a
most lowly thief, possibly worse. George Collroy, coiner and a
ferocious villain. Vinnis, who follows the lowest of all grades
of dishonest livelihood&mdash;blackmailer. Here," Jimmy went on,
as he stepped aside from the cupboard, "is the gem of the
collection. I will show you our friend who has so coyly effaced
himself."</p>

<p>He addressed the occupant of the cupboard.</p>

<p>"Come out, Goyle," he said sharply. There was no response.
Jimmy pointed to one of the ruffians in the&mdash;room. "Open
that door," he commanded. The man slunk forward and pulled the
door open.</p>

<p>"Come out, Goyle," he growled, then stepped back with blank
astonishment stamped upon his face. "Why&mdash;why," he gasped,
"there's nobody there!"</p>

<p>With a cry, Jimmy started forward. One glance convinced him
that the man spoke the truth, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>There were keen wits in that crowd, men used to crises and
quick to act. Bat Sands saw Jimmy's attention diverted for a
moment, and Jimmy's pistol hand momentarily lowered.</p>

<p>To think with Bat Sands was to act.</p>

<p>Jimmy, turning back upon the "Lot," saw the life preserver
descending, and leapt on one side; then, as he recovered,
somebody threw a coat at the lamp, and the room was in
darkness.</p>

<p>Jimmy reached out his hand and caught the girl by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Into that cupboard," he whispered, pushing her into the
recess from which Goyle had so mysteriously vanished. Then, with
one hand on the edge of the door, he groped around with his
pistol for his assailants. He could hear their breathing and the
creak of the floorboards as they came toward him.</p>

<p>He crouched down by the door, judging that the "cosh" would
he aimed in a line with his head. By and by he heard the swish
of the descending stick, and "crash!" the preserver struck the
wall above him.</p>

<p>He was confronted with a difficulty; to fire would be to
invite trouble. He had no desire to attract the attention of the
police for many reasons. Unless the life of the girl was in
danger he resolved to hold his fire, and when Ike Josephs,
feeling cautiously forward with his stick, blundered into Jimmy,
Ike suddenly dropped to the floor without a cry, because he had
been hit a fairly vicious blow in that portion of the anatomy
which is dignified with the title "solar plexus."</p>

<p>It was just after this that he heard a startled little cry
from the girl behind him, and then a voice that sent his heart
into his mouth. "All right! All right! All right!"</p>

<p>There was only one man who used that tag, and Jimmy's heart
rose up to bless his name in thankfulness.</p>

<p>"This way, Miss Kent," said the voice, "mind the little step.
Don't be afraid of the gentleman on the floor, he's handcuffed
and strapped and gagged, and is perfectly harmless."</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. The mystery of Angel's intimate knowledge of
the "Lot's" plans and of Connor's movements, the disappearance
of Goyle, were all explained.</p>

<p>He did not know for certain that the occupant of the "empty"
house next door had industriously cut through the thin party-walls
that separated the two houses, and had rigged up a "back"
to the cupboard that was really a door, but he guessed it.</p>

<p>Then a blinding ray of light shot into the room where the
"Borough Lot" still groped for its enemy, and a gentle voice
said: "Gentlemen, you may make your choice which way you
go&mdash;out by the front door, where my friend, Inspector
Collyer, with quite large number of men, is waiting; or by the
back door, where Sergeant Murtle and exactly seven plain-clothes
men are impatiently expecting you."</p>

<p>Bat recognized the voice. "Angel Esquire!" he cried in
consternation. From the darkness behind the dazzling electric
lamp that threw a narrow lane of light into the apartment came
an amused chuckle.</p>

<p>"What is it," asked Angel's persuasive voice, "a cop?"</p>

<p>"It's a fair cop," said Bat truthfully.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; THE CRYPTOGRAM</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. SPEDDING looked at his watch. He stood upon
the marble-tiled floor of the Great Deposit. High above his
head, suspended from the beautiful dome, blazed a hundred lights
from an ornate electrolier. He paced before the great pedestal
that towered up from the centre of the building, and the floor
was crisscrossed with the shadows of the steel framework that
encased it. But for the dozen chairs that were placed in a
semicircle before the great granite base, the big hall was bare
and unfurnished.</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding walked up and down, and his footsteps rang
hollow; when he spoke the misty space of the building caught up
his voice and sent down droning echoes.</p>

<p>"There is only the lady to come," he said, looking at his
watch again. He spoke to the two men who sat at either extreme
of the crescent of chairs.</p>

<p>The one was Jimmy, a brooding, thoughtful figure; the other
was Connor, ill at ease and subdued. Behind the chairs, at some
distance, stood two men who looked like artisans, as indeed they
were: at their feet lay a bag of tools, and on a small board a
heap that looked like sand.</p>

<p>At the door a stolid-looking commissionaire waited, his
breast glittering with medals.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the vestibule, the rustle of a woman's
dress, and Kathleen Kent entered, closely followed by Angel
Esquire.</p>

<p>At him the lawyer looked questioningly as he walked forward
to greet the girl.</p>

<p>"Mr. Angel has kindly offered me his help," she said
timidly&mdash;then, recognizing Connor, her face
flushed&mdash;"and if necessary, his protection."</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding bowed. "I hope you will not find this part of
the ceremony trying," he said in a low voice, and led the girl
to a chair. Then he made a signal to the commissionaire.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen?" Kathleen whispered to her
companion, and Angel shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can only guess," he replied in the same tone. He was
looking up at the great safe wherein he knew was stored the
wealth of the dead gambler, and wondering at the freakish
ingenuity that planned and foresaw this strange scene.</p>

<p>The creak of footsteps in the doorway made him turn his head.
He saw a white-robed figure, and behind him a black-coated man
in attendance, holding on a cushion a golden casket.</p>

<p>Then the dread, familiar words brought him to his feet with a
shiver:&mdash;"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live: and whosoever liveth and liveth in me shall never die."
The clergyman's solemn voice resounded through the building, and
the detective realized that the ashes of the dead man were
coming to their last abiding-place.</p>

<p>The slow procession moved toward the silent party. Slowly it
paced toward the column; then, as the clergyman's feet rang on
the steel stairway that wound upward, he began the Psalm which
of all others perhaps most fitted the passing of old
Reale:&mdash;"Have mercy upon me, O God, after Thy great
goodness... Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me
from my sin... Behold, I was shapen in wickedness... Deliver me
from bloodguiltiness, O God..." Halfway up the column a small
gap yawned in the unbroken granite face, and into this the
golden cabinet was pushed; then the workman, who had formed one
of the little party that wound upward, lifted a smooth cube of
polished granite.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy
to take unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here
departed..." The mason's trowel grated on the edges of the
cavity, the block of stone was thrust in until it was flush with
the surface of the pedestal. Carved on the end of the stone were
four words:&mdash;</p>

<p>Pulvis Cinis et Nihil.</p>

<p>It was when the workmen had been dismissed, and the lawyer
was at the door bidding adieu to the priest whose strange duty
had been performed, that Angel crossed to where Jimmy sat. He
caught Jimmy's grim smile, and raised his eyes to where all that
was mortal of Reale had been placed.</p>

<p>"The Latin?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"Surprising, isn't it?" said the other quietly. "Reale had
seen things, you know. A man who travels picks up information."
He nodded toward the epitaph.</p>

<p>"He got that idea at Toledo, in the cathedral there. Do you
know it? A slab of brass over a dead king-maker, Portocarrero,
'Hic iacet pulvis cinis et nihil'. I translated it for him; the
conceit pleased him. Sitting here, watching his strange funeral,
I wondered if 'pulvis cinis et nihil' would come into it."</p>

<p>And now Spedding came creaking back. The workmen had
disappeared, the outer door was closed, and the commissionaire
had retired to his room leading from the vestibule. In
Spedding's hand was a bundle of papers. He took his place with
his back to the granite pedestal and lost no time in
preliminaries.</p>

<p>"I have here the will of the late James Ryan Reale," he
began. "The contents of this will are known to every person here
except Miss Kent."</p>

<p>He had a dry humour of his own, this lawyer, as his next
words proved.</p>

<p>"A week ago a very clever burglary was committed in my
office; the safe was opened, a private dispatch box forced, and
my papers ransacked. I must do my visitor justice"&mdash;he
bowed slightly, first in the direction of Connor, then toward
Jimmy&mdash;"and say that nothing was taken and practically
nothing disturbed. There was plenty of evidence that the object
of the burglary was to secure a sight of this will."</p>

<p>Jimmy was unperturbed at the scarcely-veiled charge, and if
he moved it was only with the object of taking up an easier
position in the chair. Not even the shocked eyes of the girl
that looked appealingly toward him caused him any apparent
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said, as the lawyer paused as though waiting for
an admission. He was quietly amused. He knew very well now who
this considerate burglar was.</p>

<p>"By copying this will the burglar or burglars obtained an
unfair advantage over the other legatee or legatees." The stiff
paper crackled noisily as he unfolded the document in his hand.
"I will formally read the will and afterwards explain it to such
of you as need the explanation," Spedding resumed. The girl
listened as the lawyer began to read. Confused by the legal
terminology, the endless repetitions, and the chaotic verbiage
of the instrument, she yet realized as the reading went on that
this last will and testament of old Reale was something
extraordinary. There was mention of houses and estates,
freeholds and bonds...</p>

<p>"...and all the residue of any property whatsoever and
wheresoever absolutely" that went to somebody. To whom she could
not gather. Once she thought it was to herself, "to Francis
Corydon Kent, Esquire, or the heirs of his body;" once it
sounded as though this huge fortune was to be inherited by
"James Cavendish Fairfax Stannard, Baronet of the United
Kingdom."</p>

<p>She wondered if this was Jimmy, and remembered in a vague way
that she had heard that the ninth baronet of that name was a
person of questionable character.</p>

<p>Then again it seemed as if the legatee was to be "Patrick
George Connor."</p>

<p>There was a doggerel verse in the will that the lawyer
gabbled through, and something about the great safe, then the
lawyer came to an end.</p>

<p>In the conventional declaration of the witnesses lay a sting
that sent a dull red flush to Connor's cheek and again provoked
Jimmy's grim smile. The lawyer read:&mdash;"Signed by the above
James Ryan Reale as his last will and testament (the word
'thief' after 'James Cavendish Fairfax Stannard, Baronet of the
United Kingdom' and the word 'thief' after 'Patrick George
Connor,' in the twentieth and twenty-third lines from the top
hereof, having been deleted), in the presence of us..."</p>

<p>The lawyer folded the will perversely and put it in his
pocket. Then he took four slips of paper from an envelope. "It
is quite clear to you gentlemen."</p>

<p>He did not wait for the men's reply, but went on addressing
the bewildered girl.</p>

<p>"To you, Miss Kent, I am afraid the will is not so clear. I
will explain it in a few words. My late client was the owner of
a gambling establishment. Thus he amassed a huge fortune, which
he has left to form, if I may so put it, a large prize fund. The
competitors are yourselves. Frankly, it is a competition between
the dupes, or the heirs of the dupes, who were ruined by my late
client, and the men who helped in the fleecing."</p>

<p>The lawyer spoke dispassionately, as though expounding some
hypothesis, but there was that in his tone which made Connor
wince.</p>

<p>"Your father, my dear young lady, was one of these dupes many
years ago&mdash;you must have been at school at the time. He
became suddenly a poor man."</p>

<p>The girl's face grew hard.</p>

<p>"So that was how it happened," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"That is how it happened," the lawyer repeated gravely. "Your
father's fortune was one of four great fortunes that went into
the coffers of my late client."</p>

<p>The formal description of Reale seemed to lend him an air of
respectability.</p>

<p>"The other three have long since died, neither of them
leaving issue. You are the sole representative of the victims.
These gentlemen are&mdash;let use say&mdash;in opposition. This
safe," he waved his hand toward the great steel room that
crowned the granite column, "contains the fortune. The safe
itself is the invention of my late client. Where the lock should
be are six dials, on each of which are the letters of the
alphabet. The dials are ranged one inside the other, and on one
side is a steel pointer. A word of six letters opens the safe.
By turning the dials so that the letters come opposite the
pointer, and form this word, the door is opened."</p>

<p>He stopped to wipe his forehead, for in the energy of his
explanation he had become hot.</p>

<p>Then he resumed&mdash;"What that word is, is for you to
discover. My late client, who had a passion for acrostics I and
puzzles and inventions of every kind, has left a doggerel verse
which he most earnestly assured me contained the solution."</p>

<p>He handed a slip first to the girl and then to the
others.</p>

<p>For a moment the world swam before Kathleen's eyes.</p>

<p>All that hinged upon that little verse came home to her.</p>

<p>Carefully conning each word, as if in fear of its
significance escaping her, she read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's a puzzle in language old, Find my meaning and get my
gold. Take one Bolt&mdash;just one, no more&mdash;Fix it on
behind a Door. Place it at a river's Mouth East or west or north
or south. Take some Leaves and put them whole In some water in a
Bowl. I found this puzzle in a book From which some mighty
truths were took."</p>

<p>She read again and yet again, the others watching her. With
every reading she seemed to get further from the solution of the
mystery, and she turned in despair to Angel.</p>

<p>"I can make nothing of it," she cried helplessly, "nothing,
nothing, nothing."</p>

<p>"It is, with due respect to my late client, the veriest
doggerel," said the lawyer frankly, "and yet on that the
inheritance of the whole of his fortune depends."</p>

<p>He had noticed that neither Connor nor Jimmy had read the
slips he had handed to them.</p>

<p>"The paper I have given you is a facsimile reproduction of
the original copy, and that may be inspected at any time at my
office."</p>

<p>The girl was scanning the rhyme in an agony of perplexity.
"I shall never do it," she said in despair.</p>

<p>Angel took the paper gently from her hand. "Don't attempt
it," he said kindly. "There is plenty of time. I do not think
that either of your rival competitors have gained anything by
the advantage they have secured. I also have had in my
possession a copy of the rhyme for the past week."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes opened wide in astonishment. "You?" she
said.</p>

<p>Angel's explanation was arrested by a singular
occurrence.</p>

<p>Connor sat at one end of the row of chairs moodily eying the
paper.</p>

<p>Jimmy thoughtfully stroking his beard at the other end,
suddenly rose and walked to where his brooding confederate sat.
The man shrunk back as he approached, and Jimmy, seating himself
by his side, bent forward and said something in a low voice. He
spoke rapidly, and Angel, watching them closely, saw a look of
incredulous surprise come into Connor's face. Then wrath and
incredulity mingled, and Connor sprang up, striking the back of
the chair with his fist.</p>

<p>"What?" he roared. "Give up a chance of a fortune? I'll see
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy's voice never rose, but he gripped Connor's arm and
pulled him down into his chair.</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't! D'ye think I'm going to throw
away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy released the man's arm and rose with a shrug of his
shoulders. He walked to where Kathleen was standing.</p>

<p>"Miss Kent," he said, and hesitated. "It is difficult for me
to say what I have to say; but I want to tell you that so far as
I am concerned the fortune is yours. I shall make no claim to
it, and I will afford you every assistance that lies in my power
to discover the word that is hidden in the verse."</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. Her lips were set tight, and the hard
look that Angel had noticed when the lawyer had referred to her
father came back again.</p>

<p>Jimmy waited a moment for her to speak, but she made no sign,
and with a slight bow he walked toward the door. "Stop!" It was
Kathleen that spoke, and Jimmy turned and waited.</p>

<p>"As I understand this will," she said slowly, "you are one of
the men to whom my father owed his ruin."</p>

<p>His eyes met hers unfalteringly. "Yes," he said simply.</p>

<p>"One of the men that I have to thank for years of misery and
sorrow," she continued. "When I saw my father slowly sinking, a
broken-hearted man, weighed down with the knowledge of the folly
that had brought his wife and child to comparative poverty; when
I saw my father die, crushed in spirit by his misfortunes, I
never thought I should meet the man who brought his ruin
about."</p>

<p>Still Jimmy's gaze did not waver. Impassive, calm and
imperturbable, he listened unmoved to the bitter indictment.</p>

<p>"This will says you were a man of my father's own class, one
who knew the tricks by which a gentle, simple man, with a
childish faith in such men as you, might be lured into
temptation."</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply, and the girl went on in biting
tones&mdash;"A few days ago you helped me to escape from men
whom you introduced with an air of superiority as thieves and
blackmailers. That it was you who rendered me this service I
shall regret to the end of my days. You! You! You!"</p>

<p>She flung out her hand scornfully. "If they were thieves,
what are you? A gambler's tout? A decoy? A harpy preying on the
weakness of your unfortunate fellows?"</p>

<p>She turned to Connor. "Had this man offered me his help I
might have accepted it. Had he offered to forego his claim to
this fortune I might have been impressed by his generosity. From
you, whom God gave advantages of birth and education, and who
utilized them to bring ruin and disaster on such men as my
father, the offer is an insult!"</p>

<p>Jimmy's face was deadly pale, but he made no sign. Only his
eyes shone brighter, and the hand that twisted the point of his
beard twitched nervously.</p>

<p>The girl turned to Angel wearily. Her outburst and the
tension of the evening had exhausted her. "Will you take me
home, Mr. Angel?" she said. She offered her hand to the lawyer,
who had been an interested observer of the scene, and ignoring
the two men, she turned to go.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy spoke. "I do not attempt to excuse myself, Miss
Kent," he said evenly; "for my life and my acts I am
unaccountable to man or woman. Your condemnation makes it
neither easier nor harder to live my life. Your charity might
have made a difference."</p>

<p>He held out a detaining hand, for Kathleen had gathered up
her skirts to move away. "I have considered your question
fairly. I am one of the men to whom your father owed his ruin,
insomuch as I was one of Reale's associates. I am not one of the
men, insomuch as I used my every endeavour to dissuade your
father from taking the risks he took."</p>

<p>The humour of some recollection took hold of him, and a grim
little smile came into his face. "You say I betrayed your
father," he said in the same quiet tone. "As a fact I betrayed
Reale. I was at trouble to explain to your father the secret of
Reale's electric roulette table; I demonstrated the futility of
risking another farthing." He laughed. "I have said I would not
excuse myself, and here I am pleading like a small boy, 'If you
please, it wasn't me,'" he said a little impatiently; and then
he added abruptly, "I will not detain you," and walked away.</p>

<p>He knew instinctively that she waited a moment hesitating for
a reply, then he heard the rustle of her dress and knew she had
gone. He stood looking upward to where the graven granite set
marked the ashes of Reale, until her footsteps had died away and
the lawyer's voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir James&mdash;" he began, and Jimmy spun round with
an oath, his face white with passion.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," he said in a harsh voice, "Jimmy is my name, and I
want to hear no other, if you please."</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding, used as he was to the wayward phases of men,
was a little startled at the effect of his words, and hastened
to atone for his blunder. "I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he said
quickly. "I merely wished to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy did not wait to hear what he said, but turned upon
Connor. "I've got a few words to say to you," he said. His voice
had gone back to its calm level, but there was a menace in its
quietness. "When I persuaded Angel to give you a chance to get
away on the night the 'Borough Lot' was arrested, I hoped I
could get you to agree with me that the money should be handed
to Miss Kent when the word was found. I knew in my inmost heart
that this was a forlorn hope," he went on, "that there is no
gold in the quartz of your composition. You are just beast all
through."</p>

<p>He paced the floor of the hall for a minute or two, then he
stopped.</p>

<p>"Connor," he said suddenly, "you tried to take my life the
other night. I have a mind to retaliate. You may go ahead and
puzzle out the word that unlocks that safe. Get it by any means
that suggest themselves to you. Steal it, buy it&mdash;do
anything you wish. The day you secure the key to Reale's
treasure I shall kill you."</p>

<p>He talked like a man propounding a simple business
proposition, and the lawyer, who in his early youth had written
a heavy little paper on "The Congenital Criminal," listened and
watched, and, in quite a respectable way, gloated.</p>

<p>Jimmy picked up his hat and coat from a chair, and nodding to
the lawyer, strolled out of the hall. In the vestibule where the
one commissionaire had been were six. Every man was a
non-commissioned officer, and, as was apparent from his medals, had
seen war service. Jimmy noted the belt about each man and the
dangling revolver holster, and approved of the lawyer's
precaution.</p>

<p>"Night guard, sergeant&mdash;major?" he asked, addressing one
whose crowned sleeve showed his rank.</p>

<p>"Day and night guard, sir," replied the officer quietly.</p>

<p>"Good," said Jimmy, and passed out into the street. And now
only the lawyer and Connor remained, and as Jimmy left, they too
prepared for departure. The lawyer was mildly interested in the
big, heavy criminal who walked by his side. He was a fairly
familiar type of the bull-headed desperado.</p>

<p>"There is nothing I can explain?" asked Spedding, as they
stood together in the vestibule. Connor's eyes were on the
guard, and he frowned a little.</p>

<p>"You don't trust us very much," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't trust you at all," said the lawyer.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">VI. &mdash; A THE RED
ENVELOPE</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. SPEDDING, the admirable lawyer, lived on
Clapham Common, where he owned the freehold of that desirable
residence, "High Holly Lodge." He was a bachelor, with a taste
for bridge parties and Madeira. Curious neighbours would have
been mystified if they had known that Mr. Spedding's repair bill
during the first two years of his residence was something well
over three thousand pounds.</p>

<p>What they did know was that Mr. Spedding "had the builders
in" for an unconscionable time, that they were men who spoke in
a language entirely foreign to Clapham, and that they were
housed during the period of renovation in a little galvanized
iron bungalow erected for the purpose in the grounds. A
neighbour on visiting terms expressed his opinion that for all
the workmen had done he could discern no material difference in
the structure of the house, and from his point of view the house
presented the same appearance after the foreign builders left,
as it did before their advent. Mr. Spedding met all
carelessly-applied questions concerning the extent of the structural
alterations with supreme discretion. He spoke vaguely about a
new system of ventilation, and hinted at warmth by
radiation.</p>

<p>Suburbia loves to show off its privately conceived
improvements to property, but Mr. Spedding met veiled hints of a
desire to inspect his work with that comfortable smile which was
so valuable an asset of his business.</p>

<p>It was a few evenings after the scene in the Lombard Street
Deposit that Mr. Spedding sat in solitude before his modest
dinner at Clapham. An evening newspaper lay by the side of his
chair, and he picked it up at intervals to read again the
paragraph which told of the release of the "Borough Lot."</p>

<p>The paragraph read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The men arrested in connection with the gambling raid at
Poplar were discharged today, the police, it is understood,
failing to secure sufficient evidence to justify a
prosecution."</p>

<p>The lawyer shook his head doubtfully. "I rather like Angel
Esquire's definition," he said with a wry smile. "It is a neat
method of saving the face of the police, but I could wish that
the 'Borough Lot' were out of the way."</p>

<p>Later he had occasion to change his opinion.</p>

<p>A tap at the door preceded the entry of a sedate butler. The
lawyer looked at the card on the tray, and hesitated; then,
"Show him in," he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy came into the room, and bowed slightly to the elder
man, who rose at his entrance. They waited in silence till the
servant had closed the door behind him. "To what am I indebted?"
began the lawyer, and motioned his visitor to a seat.</p>

<p>"May I smoke?" asked Jimmy, and Mr. Spedding nodded.</p>

<p>"It is in the matter of Reale's millions," said Jimmy, and
allowed his eyes to follow the cloud of smoke he blew.</p>

<p>"I thought it was understood that this was a subject which
might only be discussed at my office and in business hours?"
said the lawyer sharply, and Jimmy nodded again.</p>

<p>"You will confess, Mr. Spedding," he said easily, "that the
Reale will is sufficiently unconventional to justify any
departure from established custom on the part of the fortunate
or unfortunate legatees."</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding made an impatient movement of his hand.</p>

<p>"I do not inquire into your business," Jimmy went on smoothly
enough, "and I am wholly incurious as to in what strange manner
you became acquainted with your late client, or what fees you
received to undertake so extraordinary a commission; but I am
satisfied that you are recompensed for such trifling
inconveniences as&mdash;say&mdash;an after-dinner visit from
myself."</p>

<p>Jimmy had a way of choosing his words, hesitating for the
exact expression that would best convey every shade of his
meaning. The lawyer, too, recognized the logic of the speech,
and contented himself with a shrug which meant nothing.</p>

<p>"I do not inquire into your motives," Jimmy resumed; "it
pleases me to believe that they are entirely disinterested, that
your attitude is the ideal one as between client and agent."</p>

<p>His pause was longer this time, and the lawyer was piqued
into interjecting an impatient&mdash;"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy slowly, "believing all this, let us say, I
am at a loss to know why at the reading of the will you gave us
no indication of the existence of a key to this mysterious
verse."</p>

<p>"There is no key," said the lawyer quickly, and added, "so
far as I know."</p>

<p>"That you did not tell us," Jimmy went on, as though
unconscious of any interruption, "of the big red
envelope&mdash;"</p>

<p>Spedding sprang to his feet white as death. "The envelope,"
he stammered angrily, "what do you know&mdash;what
envelope?"</p>

<p>Jimmy's hand waved him to his seat. "Let us have no emotions,
no flights, no outraged honour, I beg of you, dear Mr. Spedding.
I do not suggest that you have any sinister reasons for
withholding information concerning what my friend Angel would
call the 'surprise packet'. In good time I do not doubt you
would have disclosed its existence."</p>

<p>"I know of no red envelope," said the lawyer doggedly.</p>

<p>"I rather fancied you would say that," said Jimmy, with a
touch of admiration in his tone. "You are not the sort of fox to
curl up and howl at the first bay of the hound&mdash;if you will
permit the simile&mdash;indeed, you would have disappointed me
if you had."</p>

<p>The lawyer paced the room. "Look here," he said, coming to a
halt before the semi-recumbent form that lay behind a haze of
cigarette smoke in the arm-chair, "you've spent a great deal of
your time telling me what I am, describing my many doubtful
qualities, and hinting more or less broadly that I am a fairly
representative scoundrel. May I ask what is is your ultimate
object? Is it blackmail?" he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmy, by no means disconcerted by the brutality
of the question. "Are you begging, or borrowing, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stealing?" murmured Jimmy lazily.</p>

<p>"All that I have to say to you is, finish your business and
go. Furthermore, you are at liberty to come with me tomorrow
morning and search my office and question my clerks. I will
accompany you to my banks, and to the strong-room I rent at the
deposit. Search for this red envelope you speak about, and if
you find it, you are at liberty to draw the worst deductions you
will."</p>

<p>Jimmy pulled gently at his cigarette with reflective eyes
cast upward to the ceiling. "Do you speak Spanish?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No," said the other impatiently.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," said Jimmy, with a note of genuine regret.
"Spanish is a very useful language&mdash;especially in the
Argentine, for which delightful country, I understand, lawyers
who betray their trust have an especial predilection. My Spanish
needs a little furbishing, and only the other day I was
practising with a man whose name, I believe, is Murrello. Do you
know him?"</p>

<p>"If you have completed your business, I will ring for the
servant," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"He told me&mdash;my Spaniard, I mean&mdash;a curious story.
He comes from Barcelona, and by way of being a mason or
something of the sort, was brought to England with some other of
his fellow-countrymen to make some curious alterations to the
house of a Senor in&mdash;er&mdash;Clapham of all places in the
world."</p>

<p>The lawyer's breath came short and fast.</p>

<p>"From what I was able to gather," Jimmy went on languidly,
"and my Spanish is Andalusian rather than Catalonian, so that I
missed some of his interesting narrative, these alterations
partook of the nature of wonderfully concealed strong-rooms
&mdash;steel doors artfully covered with cheap wood
carving, vaults cunningly constructed beneath innocent basement
kitchens, little stairways in apparently solid walls and the
like."</p>

<p>The levity went out of his voice, and he straightened himself
in his chair.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to search your office," he said quietly,
"or perhaps I should say no further desire, for I have already
methodically examined every hole and corner. No," he checked the
words on Spedding's lips, "no, it was not I who committed the
blundering burglary you spoke of. You never found traces of me,
I'll swear. You may keep the keys of your strong-room, and I
shall not trouble your bankers."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded the lawyer shortly.</p>

<p>"I want to see what you have got downstairs," was the reply,
and there was no doubting its earnestness, "and more especially
do I want to see the red envelope."</p>

<p>The lawyer bent his brows in thought. His eyes were fixed
unwaveringly on Jimmy's. "Suppose," he said slowly, "suppose
that such an envelope did exist, suppose for the sake of
argument these mysterious vaults and secret chambers are, as you
suggest, in existence, what right have you, more than any other
one of the beneficiaries under the will, to demand a private
examination? Why should I give you an unfair advantage over
them?"</p>

<p>Jimmy rose to his feet and stretched himself before replying.
"There is only one legatee whom I recognize," he said briefly,
"that is the girl. The money is hers. I do not want a farthing.
I am equally determined that nobody else shall touch a
penny&mdash;neither my young friend Connor "&mdash;he stopped to
give emphasis to the next two words&mdash;"nor yourself."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said the outraged Mr. Spedding.</p>

<p>"Nor yourself, Mr. Spedding," repeated Jimmy with conviction.
"Let us understand each other thoroughly. You are, as I read
you, a fairly respectable citizen. I would trust you with ten or
a hundred thousand pounds without experiencing the slightest
anxiety. I would not trust you with two millions in solid cash,
nor would I trust any man. The magnitude of the sum is
calculated to overwhelm your moral sense. The sooner the red
envelope is in the possession of Angel Esquire the better for us
all."</p>

<p>Spedding stood with bent head, his fingers nervously stroking
his jaw, thinking.</p>

<p>"An agile mind this," thought Jimmy; "if I am not careful
there will be trouble here." He watched the lawyer's face, and
noticed the lines suddenly disappear from the troubled face, and
the placid smile returning. "Conciliation and partial
confession," judged Jimmy, and his diagnosis was correct.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Jimmy," said Spedding, with some show of
heartiness, "since you know so much, it may be as well to tell
you more. As you have so cleverly discovered, my house to a
great extent is a strong-room. There are many valuable documents
that I could not with any confidence leave deposited at my
office. They are safer here under my eye, so to speak. The
papers of the late Mr. Reale are, I confess, in this house;
but&mdash;now mark me&mdash;whether the red envelope you speak
of is amongst these I do not know. There is a multitude of
documents in connection with the case, all of which I have had
no time to go through. The hour is late, but&mdash;" He paused
irresolutely. "&mdash;If you would care to inspect the mysteries
of the basement "&mdash;he smiled benevolently, and was his old
self&mdash;"I shall be happy to have your assistance in a
cursory search."</p>

<p>Jimmy was alert and watchful and to the point. "Lead the
way," he said shortly, and Spedding, after a moment's
hesitation, opened the door and Jimmy followed him into the
hall.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, the lawyer led him upstairs,
and through a plainly furnished bedroom to a small dressing room
that opened off. There was a conventional wardrobe against the
wall, and this Spedding opened. A dozen suits hung from hooks
and stretchers, and the lawyer groped amongst these for a
moment. Then there was a soft click, and the back of the
wardrobe swung back. Spedding turned to his visitor with a
quizzical smile.</p>

<p>"Your friend Angel's method of gaining admittance to the
haunt of the 'Borough Lot' was not original. Come."</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped gingerly through into the darkness. He heard
the snap of a button, and a soft glow of light revealed a tiny
chamber, in which two men might comfortably stand upright. The
back of the wardrobe closed, and they were alone in a little
room about as large as an average cupboard. There was a steel
lever on one side of the walls, and this the lawyer pulled
cautiously. Jimmy felt a sinking sensation, and heard a faint,
far-off buzzing of machinery.</p>

<p>"An electric lift, I take it," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"An electric lift," repeated the lawyer.</p>

<p>Down, down, down they sank, till Jimmy calculated that they
must be at least twenty feet below the street level. Then the
lift slowed down and stopped at a door. Spedding opened this
with a key he took from his pocket, and they stepped out into a
chill, earthy darkness.</p>

<p>"There's a light here," said the lawyer, and groped for the
switch. They were in a large vaulted apartment lit from the
roof. At one end a steel door faced them, and ranged about the
vault on iron racks a number of black japanned boxes.</p>

<p>Jimmy noted the inscriptions, and was a little surprised at
the extent and importance of the solicitor's practice. Spedding
must have read his thoughts, for he turned with a smile.</p>

<p>"Not particularly suggestive of a defaulting solicitor," he
said ironically.</p>

<p>"Two million pounds," replied Jimmy immediately, "that is my
answer to you, Mr. Spedding. An enormous fortune for the
reaching. I wouldn't trust the Governors of the Bank of
England."</p>

<p>Spedding may have been annoyed as he walked to the door in
the wall and opened it, but he effectively concealed his
annoyance. As the door fell backward, Jimmy saw a little
apartment, four feet by six feet, with a roof he could touch
with his hand. There was a fresh current of air, but from whence
it came he could not discover. The only articles of furniture in
the little cell were a writing table and a swing chair placed
exactly beneath the electric lamp in the roof. Spedding pulled
open a drawer in the desk.</p>

<p>"I do not keep my desks locked here," he said pleasantly
enough. It was characteristic of him that he indulged in no
preamble, no apologetic preliminaries, and that he showed no
sign of embarrassment as he slipped his hand into the drawer,
and drawing forth a bulky red envelope, threw it on to the desk.
You might have forgotten that his last words were denials that
the red envelope had existed.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at him curiously, and the lawyer returned his
gaze.</p>

<p>"A new type?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hardly," said Jimmy cheerfully. "I once knew a man like you
in the Argentine&mdash;he was hanged eventually."</p>

<p>"Curious," mused the lawyer, "I have often thought I might be
hanged, but have never quite seen why&mdash;" He nearly added
something else, but checked himself.</p>

<p>Jimmy had the red envelope in his hand and was examining it
closely. It was heavily sealed with the lawyer's own seal, and
bore the inscription in Reale's crabbed, illiterate handwriting,
"Puzzle Ideas."</p>

<p>He weighed it and pinched it. There was a little compact
packet inside.</p>

<p>"I shall open this," said Jimmy decisively. "You, of course,
have already examined it."</p>

<p>The lawyer made no reply. Jimmy broke the seal of the
envelope. Half his mind was busy in speculation as to its
contents, the other half was engaged with the lawyer's plans.
Jimmy was too experienced a man to be deceived by the
complaisance of the smooth Mr. Spedding. He watched his every
move. All the while he was engaged in what appeared to be a
concentrated examination of the packet his eyes never left the
lawyer. That Spedding made no sign was a further proof in
Jimmy's eyes that the coup was to come.</p>

<p>"We might as well examine the envelope upstairs as here,"
said the lawyer. The other man nodded, and followed him from the
cell. Spedding closed the steel door and locked it, then turned
to Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Do you notice," he said with some satisfaction, "how
skilfully this chamber is constructed?" He waved his hand round
the larger vault, at the iron racks and the shiny black
boxes.</p>

<p>Jimmy was alert now. The lawyer's geniality was too
gratuitous, his remarks a trifle inapropos. It was like the lame
introduction to a story which the teller was anxious to drag in
at all hazards.</p>

<p>"Here, for instance," said the lawyer, tapping one of the
boxes, "is what appears to be an ordinary deed box. As a matter
of fact, it is an ingenious device for trapping burglars, if
they should by any chance reach the vault. It is not opened by
an ordinary key, but by the pressure of a button, either in my
room or here."</p>

<p>He walked leisurely to the end of the vault, Jimmy
following.</p>

<p>For a man of his build Spedding was a remarkably agile man.
Jimmy had underrated his agility. He realized this when suddenly
the lights went out. Jimmy sprang for the lawyer, and struck the
rough stone wall of the vault. He groped quickly left and right,
and grasped only the air.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," commanded Spedding's calm voice from the other
end of the chamber, "and keep cool. I am going to show you my
burglar catcher."</p>

<p>Jimmy's lingers were feeling along the wall for the switch
that controlled the lights. As if divining his intention, the
lawyer's voice said&mdash;"The lights are out of control,
Jimmy, and I am fairly well out of your reach."</p>

<p>"We shall see," was Jimmy's even reply.</p>

<p>"And if you start shooting you will only make the atmosphere
of this place a little more unbreathable than it is at present,"
Spedding went on.</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled in the darkness, and the lawyer heard the snap
of a Colt pistol as his captive loaded.</p>

<p>"Did you notice the little ventilator?" asked the lawyer's
voice again. "Well, I am behind that. Between my unworthy body
and your nickel bullets there are two feet of solid
masonry."</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply, his pistol went back to his hip again.
He had his electric lamp in his pocket, but prudently kept it
there. "Before we go any further," he said slowly, "will you be
good enough to inform me as to your intentions?"</p>

<p>He wanted three minutes, he wanted them very badly; perhaps
two minutes would be enough. All the time the lawyer was
speaking he was actively employed. He had kicked off his shoes
when the lights went out, and now he stole round the room, his
sensitive hands flying over the stony walls.</p>

<p>"As to my intentions," the lawyer was saying, "it must be
fairly obvious to you that I am not going to hand you over to
the police. Rather, my young friend, in the vulgar parlance of
the criminal classes, I am going to 'do you in', meaning
thereby, if you will forgive the legal terminology, that I shall
assist you to another and, I hope, though I am not sanguine, a
better world."</p>

<p>He heard Jimmy's insolent laugh in the blackness.</p>

<p>"You are a man after my own heart, Jimmy," he went on
regretfully. "I could have wished that I might have been spared
this painful duty; but it is a duty, one that I owe to society
and myself."</p>

<p>"You are an amusing person," said Jimmy's voice.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so. Jimmy, my young friend, I am afraid
our conversation must end here. Do you know anything of
chemistry?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Then you will appreciate my burglar catcher," said Spedding,
with uncanny satisfaction. "You, perhaps, noticed the japanned
box with the perforated lid? You did? Good! There are two
compartments, and two chemicals in certain quantities kept
apart. My hand is on the key now that will combine them. When
cyanide of potassium is combined with sulphuric acid, do you
know what gas is formed?"</p>

<p>Jimmy did not reply. He had found what he had been searching
for. His talk with the Spanish builder had been to some purpose.
It was a little stony projection from the wall. He pressed it
downward, and was sensible of a sensation of coldness. He
reached out his hand, and found where solid wall had been a
blank space.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Jimmy?" asked the lawyer's voice.</p>

<p>"I hear," replied Jimmy, and felt for the edge of the secret
door. His fingers sliding down the smooth surface of the flange
encountered the two catches.</p>

<p>"It is hydrocyanic acid," said the lawyer's smooth voice, and
Jimmy heard the snap of the button. "Goodbye," said the lawyer's
voice again, and Jimmy reeled back through the open doorway
swinging the door behind him, and carrying with him a whiff of
air heavily laden with the scent of almonds.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">VII. &mdash; WHAT THE RED ENVELOPE
HELD</a></h2>

<p class="first"><i>"MY dear Angel,"</i> wrote Jimmy, <i>"I
commend to you one Mr. Spedding, an ingenious man. If by chance
you ever wish to visit him, do so in business hours. If you
desire to examine his most secret possession, effect an entrance
into a dreary-looking house at the corner of Cley's Road, a
stone's-throw from 'High Holly Lodge'. It is marked in plain
characters 'To Let.' In the basement you will find a coal-
cellar. Searching the coal-cellar diligently, you will discover
a flight of stone steps leading to a subterranean passage, which
burrows under the ground until it arrives at friend Spedding's
particular private vault. If this reads like a leaf torn from
Dumas or dear Harrison Ainsworth it is not my fault. I visited
our legal adviser last night, and had quite a thrilling evening.
That I am alive this morning is a tribute to my caution and
foreseeing wisdom. The result of my visit is this: I have the
key of the 'safe-word' in my hands. Come and get it."</i></p>

<br>

<p>Angel found the message awaiting him when he reached Scotland
Yard that morning. He too had spent sleepless hours in a futile
attempt to unravel the mystery of old Reale's doggerel
verse.</p>

<p>A telegram brought Kathleen Kent to town. Angel met her at a
quiet restaurant in Rupert Street, and was struck by the
delicate beauty of this slim girl with the calm, gray eyes. She
greeted him with a sad little smile.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would never see me again after my outburst
of the other night," she said. "This&mdash;this&mdash;person is
a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy?" asked the detective cheerily. "Oh, yes, Jimmy's by
way of being a friend; but he deserved all you said, and he
knows it, Miss Kent."</p>

<p>The girl's face darkened momentarily as she thought of Jimmy.
"I shall never understand," she said slowly, "how a man of his
gifts allowed himself to become&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," protested the detective, "he told you he took no part
in the decoying of your father."</p>

<p>The girl turned with open-eyed astonishment. "Surely you do
not expect me to believe his excuses," she cried.</p>

<p>Angel Esquire looked grave. "That is just what I should ask
you to believe," he said quietly. "Jimmy makes no excuses, and
he would certainly tell no lie in extenuation of his
faults."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," said Kathleen, bewildered, "he is a thief by
his own showing&mdash;a bad man."</p>

<p>"A thief," said Angel soberly, "but not a bad man. Jimmy is a
puzzle to most people. To me he is perfectly understandable;
that is because I have too much of the criminal in my own
composition, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I wish, oh, how I wish I had your faith in him! Then I could
absolve him from suspicion of having helped ruin my poor
father."</p>

<p>"I think you can do that," said the detective almost eagerly.
"Believe me, Jimmy is not to be judged by conventional
standards. If you ask me to describe him, I would say that he is
a genius who works in an eccentric circle that sometimes
overlaps, sometimes underreaches the rigid circle of the law. If
you asked me as a policeman, and if I was his bitterest enemy,
what I could do with Jimmy, I should say, 'Nothing'. I know of
no crime with which I could charge him, save at times with
associating with doubtful characters. As a matter of fact, that
equally applies to me. Listen, Miss Kent. The first big
international case I figured in was a gigantic fraud on the
Egyptian Bank. Some four hundred thousand pounds were involved,
and whilst from the outsider's point of view Jimmy was beyond
suspicion, yet we who were working at the case suspected him,
and pretty strongly. The men who owned the bank were rich
Egyptians, and the head of all was a Somebody-or-other-Pasha, as
great a scoundrel as ever drew breath. It is impossible to tell
a lady exactly how big a scoundrel he was, but you may guess.
Well, the Pasha knew it was Jimmy who had done the trick, and we
knew, but we dare not say so. The arrest of Jimmy would have
automatically ruined the banker. That was where I realized the
kind of man I had to deal with, and I am always prepared when
Jimmy's name is mentioned in connection with a big crime to
discover that his victim deserved all he got, and a little
more."</p>

<p>The girl gave a little shiver. "It sounds dreadful. Cannot
such a man as that employ his talents to a greater
advantage?"</p>

<p>Angel shrugged his shoulders despairingly. "I've given up
worrying about misapplied talents; it is a subject that touches
me too closely," he said. "But as to Jimmy, I'm rather glad you
started the conversation in that direction, because I'm going to
ask you to meet him today."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't," she began.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of what happened on the night the will was
read? Well, you must forget that. Jimmy has the key to the
verse, and it is absolutely imperative that you should be
present this afternoon."</p>

<p>With some demur, she consented. In the sitting-room of
Jimmy's flat the three sat round a table littered with odds and
ends of papers. The girl had met him with some trepidation, and
his distant bow had done more to assure her than had he
displayed a desire to rehabilitate himself in her good
opinion.</p>

<p>Without any preliminaries, Jimmy showed the contents of the
packet. He did not explain to the girl by what means he had come
into possession of them.</p>

<p>"Of all these papers," began Jimmy, tapping the letter before
him, "only one is of any service, and even that makes confusion
worse confounded. Reale had evidently had this cursed cryptogram
in his mind for a long time. He had made many experiments, and
rejected many. Here is one."</p>

<p>He pushed over a card, which bore a few words in Reale's
characteristic hand. Angel read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The word of five letters I will use, namely: 1. White every
24 sec. 2. Fixed white and red. 3. White group two every 30 sec.
4. Group occ. white red sec. 30 sec. 5. Fixed white and
red."</p>

<p>Underneath was written:</p>

<p>"No good; too easy."</p>

<p>The detective's brows were bent in perplexity. "I'm blessed
if I can see where the easiness comes in," he said. "To me it
seems so much gibberish, and as difficult as the other."</p>

<p>Jimmy noted the detective's bewilderment with a quiet smile
of satisfaction. He did not look directly at the girl, but out
of the corner of his eyes he could see her eager young face bent
over the card, her pretty forehead wrinkled in a despairing
attempt to decipher the curious document.</p>

<p>"Yet it was easy," he said, "and if Reale had stuck to that
word, the safe would have been opened by now."</p>

<p>Angel pored over the mysterious clue. "The word, as far as I
can gather," said Jimmy, "is 'smock,' but it may be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How on earth&mdash;" began Angel in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's easy," said Jimmy cheerfully, "and I am surprised
that an old traveller like yourself should have missed it."</p>

<p>"Group occ. white red sec. 30 sec.," read Angel.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed.</p>

<p>It was the first time the girl had seen this strange man
throw aside his habitual restraint, and she noted with an
unaccountable satisfaction that he was decidedly handsome when
amused.</p>

<p>"Let me translate it for you," said Jimmy. "Let me expand it
into, 'Group occulting White with Red Sectors every Thirty
Seconds.' Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "You may think I am shockingly dense,"
he said frankly, "but even with your lucid explanation I am
still in the dark."</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. "Suppose you went to Dover tonight, and sat
at the end of the Admiralty Pier. It is a beautiful night, with
stars in the sky, and you are looking toward France, and you
see&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Angel slowly; "a few ships' lights, perhaps,
and the flash of the Calais Lighthouse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The occulting flash?" suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>"The occ.! By Jove!"</p>

<p>"Glad you see it," said Jimmy briskly. "What old Reale did
was to take the names of five famous lights&mdash;any nautical
almanac will give you them: Sanda. Milford Haven. Orkneys. Caldy
Island. Kinnaird Head. They form an acrostic, and the initial
letters form the work 'smock '; but it was too easy&mdash;and
too hard, because there are two or three lights, particularly
the fixed lights, that are exactly the same, so he dropped that
idea."</p>

<p>Angel breathed an admiring sigh. "Jimmy, you're a wonder," he
said simply.</p>

<p>Jimmy, busying himself amongst the papers, stole a glance at
the girl.</p>

<p>"I am very human," he thought, and was annoyed at the
discovery.</p>

<p>"Now we come to the more important clue," he said, and
smoothed a crumpled paper on the table. "This, I believe, to
have a direct bearing on the verse."</p>

<p>Then three heads came close together over the scrawled
sheet.</p>

<p>"A picture of a duck, which means T," spelt Angel, "and
that's erased; and then it is a snake that means T&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>"In Reale's verse," he said deliberately, "there are six
words; outside of those six words I am convinced the verse has
no meaning. Six words strung together, and each word in
capitals. Listen."</p>

<p>He took from his pocketbook the familiar slip on which the
verse was written:</p>

<p>"Here's a puzzle in language old, Find my meaning and get my
gold. Take one BOLT&mdash;just one, no more&mdash;Fix it on
behind a DOOR. Place it at a river's MOUTH East or west or north
or south. Take some LEAVES and put them whole In some WATER in a
BOWL. I found this puzzle in a book From which some mighty
truths were took."</p>

<p>"There are six words," said Jimmy, and scribbled them down as
he spoke:</p>

<p>"Bolt (or Bolts). Leave (or Leaves). Door. Water. Mouth.
Bowl. Each one stands for a letter&mdash;but what letter?"</p>

<p>"It's rather hopeless if the old man has searched round for
all sorts of out-of-the-way objects, and allowed them to stand
for letters of the alphabet," said Angel.</p>

<p>The girl murmured something, and met Jimmy's inquiring
eyes.</p>

<p>"I was only saying," she said hesitatingly, "that there seems
to be a method in all this."</p>

<p>"Except," said Jimmy, "for this," and he pointed to the
crossed-out duck.</p>

<p>"By that it would seem that Reale chose his symbols haphazard,
and that the duck not pleasing him, he substituted the snake."</p>

<p>"But," said Kathleen, addressing Angel, "doesn't it seem
strange that an illiterate man like Mr. Reale should make even
these rough sketches unless he had a model to draw from?"</p>

<p>"Miss Kent is right," said Jimmy quickly.</p>

<p>"And," she went on, gaining confidence as she spoke, "is
there not something about these drawings that reminds you of
something?"</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," she replied, shaking her head; "and yet they
remind me of something, and worry me, just as a bar of music
that I cannot play worries me. I feel sure that I have seen them
before, that they form a part of some system&mdash;" She stopped
suddenly. "I know," she continued in a lower voice; "they are
associated in my mind&mdash;with&mdash;with the Bible."</p>

<p>The two men stared at her in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy sprang to his feet, alight with excitement. "Yes,
yes," he cried. "Angel, don't you see? The last two lines of
Reale's doggerel&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"I found this puzzle in a book<br>
 From which some mighty truths were took."</p>

<br>

<p>"Go on, go on, Miss Kent," cried Angel eagerly. "You are on
the right track. Try to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kathleen hesitated, then turned to Jimmy to address the first
remark she had directed to him personally that day.</p>

<p>"You haven't got&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Jimmy's smile was a little hard. "I'm sorry to disappoint
you, Miss Kent, but I have got a copy," he said, with a touch of
bitterness in his tone.</p>

<p>He walked to the bookcase at one end of the room and reached
down the book&mdash;a well-worn volume&mdash;and placed it
before her.</p>

<p>The rebuke in his voice was deserved, she felt that. She
turned the leaves over quickly, but inspiration seemed to have
died, for there was nothing in the sacred volume that marshalled
her struggling thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is it a text?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It is&mdash;something," she said. "That
sounds vague, doesn't it? I thought if I had the book in my
hand, it would recall everything."</p>

<p>Angel was intently studying the rebus. "Here's one letter,
anyway. You said that, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"The door?" said Jimmy. "Yes, that's fairly evident. Whatever
the word is, its second letter is 'P'. You see Reale's scribbled
notes? All these are no good, the other letters are best, I
suppose it means; so we can cut out 'T,' 'O,' and 'K'. The best
clue of all," he went on, "is the notes about the 'professor'.
You see them:</p>

<p>"Mem: To get the professor's new book on it.</p>

<p>"Mem: To do what the professor thinks right.</p>

<p>"Mem: To write to professor about&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Now the questions are: Who is the professor, what is his
book, and what did he advise? Reale was in correspondence with
him, that is certain; in his desire for accuracy, Reale sought
his advice. In all these papers there is no trace of a letter,
and if any book exists it is still in Sped&mdash;it is still in
the place from whence this red envelope came."</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a swift glance.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angel, as if answering the other's unspoken
thought, "it might be done."</p>

<p>The girl looked from one to the other in doubt.</p>

<p>"Does this mean an extra risk?" she asked quietly. "I have
not questioned you as to how this red envelope came into your
possession, but I have a feeling that it was not obtained
without danger."</p>

<p>Angel disregarded Jimmy's warning frown. He was determined
that the better side of his strange friend's character should be
made evident to the girl.</p>

<p>"Jimmy faced death in a particularly unpleasant form to
secure the packet, Miss Kent," he said.</p>

<p>"Then I forbid any further risk," she said spiritedly. "I
thought I had made it clear that I would not accept favours at
your friend's hands; least of all do I want the favour of his
life."</p>

<p>Jimmy heard her unmoved. He had a bitter tongue when he so
willed, and he chose that moment. "I do not think you can too
strongly impress upon Miss Kent the fact that I am an interested
party in this matter," he said acidly. "As she refused my offer
to forego my claim to a share of the fortune, she might remember
that my interest in the legacy is at least as great as hers. I
am risking what I risk, not so much from the beautifully
quixotic motives with which she doubtless credits me, as from a
natural desire to help myself."</p>

<p>She winced a little at the bluntness of his speech; then
recognizing she was in the wrong, she grew angry with herself at
her indiscretion.</p>

<p>"If the book is&mdash;where these papers were, it can be
secured," Jimmy continued, regaining his suavity. "If the
professor is still alive he will be found, and by tomorrow I
shall have in my possession a list of every book that has ever
been written by a professor of anything." Some thought tickled
him, and he laughed for the second time that afternoon. "There's
a fine course of reading for us all," he said with a little
chuckle. "Heaven knows into what mysterious regions the literary
professor will lead us. I know one professor who has written a
treatise on Sociology that runs into ten volumes, and another
who has spoken his mind on Inductive Logic to the extent of
twelve hundred closely-printed pages. I have in my mind's eye a
vision of three people sitting amidst a chaos of thoughtful
literature, searching ponderous tomes for esoteric references to
bolts, door, mouth, et cetera."</p>

<p>The picture he drew was too much for the gravity of the girl,
and her friendship with the man who was professedly a thief, and
by inference something worse, began with a ripple of laughter
that greeted his sally.</p>

<p>Jimmy gathered up the papers, and carefully replaced them in
the envelope. This he handed to Angel. "Place this amongst the
archives," he said flippantly.</p>

<p>"Why not keep it here?" asked Angel in surprise.</p>

<p>Jimmy walked to one of the three French windows that opened
on to a small balcony. He took a rapid survey of the street,
then beckoned to Angel. "Do you see that man?" He pointed to a
lounger sauntering along on the opposite sidewalk. "Yes."</p>

<p>Jimmy walked back to the centre of the room. "That's why," he
said simply. "There will be a burglary here tonight or tomorrow
night. People aren't going to let a fortune slip through their
fingers without making some kind of effort to save it."</p>

<p>"What people?" demanded the girl. "You mean those dreadful
men who took me away?"</p>

<p>"That is very possible," said Jimmy, "although I was thinking
of somebody else."</p>

<p>The girl had put on her wrap, and stood irresolutely near the
door, and Angel was waiting. "Goodbye," she said hesitatingly.
"I&mdash;I am afraid I have done you an injustice, and&mdash;and
I want to thank you for all you have undergone for me. I
know&mdash;I feel that I have been ungracious, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have done me no injustice," said Jimmy in a low voice.
"I am all that you thought I was&mdash;and worse."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him, and he raised it to his lips,
which was unlike Jimmy.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; OLD GEORGE</a></h2>

<p class="first">A STRANGER making a call in that portion of
North Kensington which lies in the vicinity of Ladbroke Grove by
some mischance lost his way. He wandered through many prosperous
crescents and quiet squares redolent of the opulence of the
upper middle classes, through broad avenues where neat broughams
stood waiting in small carriage-drives, and once he blundered
into a tidy mews, where horsy men with great hissings made ready
the chariots of the Notting Hill plutocracy. It may be that he
was in no particular hurry to arrive at his destination, this
stranger&mdash;who has nothing to do with the story&mdash;but
certainly he did not avail himself of opportunity in the shape
of a passing policeman, and continued his aimless wanderings. He
found Kensington Park Road, a broad thoroughfare of huge gardens
and walled forecourts, then turned into a side street. He walked
about twenty paces, and found himself in the heart of slum-land.
It is no ordinary slum this little patch of property that lies
between Westbourne Grove and Kensington Park Road. There are no
tumbled-down hovels or noisome passages; there are streets of
houses dignified with flights of steps that rise to pretentious
street doors and areas where long dead menials served the need
of the lower middle classes of other days. The streets are given
over to an army of squalling children in varying styles of
dirtiness, and the halls of these houses are bare of carpet or
covering, and in some the responsibility of leasehold is shared
by eight or nine families, all pigging together. They are
streets of slatternly women, who live at their front doors, arms
rolled under discoloured aprons, and on Saturday nights one
street at least deserves the pithy but profane appellation which
the police have given it&mdash;"Little Hell." In this particular
thoroughfare it is held that of all sins the greatest is that
which is associated&mdash;with "spying." A "spy" is a fairly
comprehensive phrase in Cawdor Street. It may mean policeman,
detective, school&mdash;board official, rent collector, or the
gentleman appointed by the gas company to extract pennies from
the slot-meters.</p>

<p>To Cawdor Street came a man who rented one of the larger
houses. To the surprise of the agent, he offered his rent
monthly in advance; to the surprise of the street, he took no
lodgers. It was the only detached house in that salubrious road,
and was No. 49. The furniture came by night, which is customary
amongst people who concentrate their last fluttering rag of
pride upon the respectability of their household goods. Cawdor
Street, on the qui vive for the lady of the house, learns with
genuine astonishment that there was none, and that the newcomer
was a bachelor. Years ago No. 49 had been the abode of a jobbing
builder, hence the little yard gate that flanked one side; and
it was with satisfaction that the Cawdor Streeters discovered
that the new occupant intended reviving the ancient splendour of
the establishment. At any rate, a board was prominently
displayed, bearing the inscription:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">J. JONES, BUILDER AND CONTRACTOR.</p>

<br>

<p>and the inquisitive Mr. Lane (of 76), who caught a momentary
vision of the yard through the gate, observed "Office" printed
in fairly large letters over the side door. At stated hours,
mostly in the evening, roughly-dressed men called at the
"Office," stayed a while, and went away. Two dilapidated ladders
made their appearance in the yard, conspicuously lifting their
perished rungs above the gate level.</p>

<p>"I tried to buy an old builder's cart and wheelbarrow today,"
said "Mr. Jones" to a workman. "I'll probably get it tomorrow at
my own price, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a few sacks
of lime and a couple of cartloads of sand and bricks in, also a
few road pitchers to give it a finishing touch."</p>

<p>The workman grinned. "You've got this place ready in time,
Connor," he said. Mr. Connor&mdash;for such "J. Jones, Builder
and Contractor" was&mdash;nodded and picked his teeth
meditatively with a match stick.</p>

<p>"I've seen for a long time the other place was useless," he
said with a curse. "It was bad luck that Angel found us there
last week. I've been fixing up this house for a couple of
months. It's a nice neighbourhood, where people don't go nosing
around, and the boys can meet here without anybody being the
wiser."</p>

<p>"And old George?"</p>

<p>"We'll settle him tonight," said the other with a frown. "Bat
is bringing him over, and I want to know how he came to let
Angel get at us."</p>

<p>Old George had always been a problem to the "Borough Lot." He
held the position of trust that many contended no demented old
man should hold.</p>

<p>"Was it safe or sane to trust him with the plate that had
been so laboriously acquired from Roebury House, and the jewels
of Lady Ivy Task-Hender, for the purloining of which one 'Hog'
Stander was at that very moment doing seven stretch? Was it wise
to install him as custodian of the empty house at Blackwall,
through which Angel Esquire gained admittance to the meeting-place
of the 'Borough Lot'? Some there were who said 'Yes,' and
these included the powerful faction that numbered 'Bat' Sands,
'Curt' Goyle, and Connor amongst them. They contended that
suspicion would never rest on this half-witted old gentleman,
with his stuffed birds, his goldfish, caged rabbits and mice, a
view that was supported by the fact that Lady Ivy's priceless
diamonds lay concealed for months in the false bottom of a hutch
devoted to guinea pigs in old George's strange menagerie, what
time the police were turning London inside out in their quest
for the property."</p>

<p>But now old George was under a cloud. Notwithstanding the
fact that he had been found amongst his live stock securely
bound to a chair, with a handkerchief over his mouth, suspicion
attached to him. How had Angel worked away in the upper room
without old George's knowledge? Angel might have easily
explained. Indeed, Angel might have relieved their minds to a
very large extent in regard to old George, for in marking down
the haunt of the "Borough Lot" he had been entirely deceived as
to the part played by the old man who acted as "caretaker" to
the "empty" house. In a four-wheeled cab old George, smiling
foolishly and passing his hand from time to time over his
tremulous mouth, listened to the admonitions of Mr. Bat
Sands.</p>

<p>"Connor wants to know all about it," said Bat menacingly,
"and if you have been playing tricks, old man, the Lord help
you."</p>

<p>"The Lord help me," smiled old George complacently. He ran
his dirty lingers through his few scanty white locks, and the
smile died out of his face, and his loose mouth dropped
pathetically.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sands," he said, then stopped; then he repeated the name
to himself a dozen times; then he rubbed his head again. Bat,
leaning forward to catch what might be a confession, sank back
again in his seat and swore softly.</p>

<p>In the house of "J. Jones, Builder and Contractor," were
gathered in strength the men who composed the "Borough Lot."</p>

<p>"Suppose he gave us away," asked Goyle, "what shall we do
with him?"</p>

<p>There was little doubt as to the feeling of the meeting. A
low animal growl, startling in its ferocity, ran through the
gathering.</p>

<p>"If he's given us away"&mdash;it was Vinnis with his dull
fishlike eyes turned upon Connor who was talking&mdash;"why, we
must 'out' him."</p>

<p>"You're talking like a fool," said Connor contemptuously. "If
he has given us away, you may rest assured that he is no sooner
in this house than the whole place will be surrounded by police.
If Angel knows old George is one of us, he'll be watched day and
night, and the cab that brings him will be followed by another
bringing Angel. No, I'll stake my life on the old man. But I
want to know how Mr. Cursed Angel got into the house next
door."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for Bat's knock came almost as
Connor finished speaking. Half led, half dragged into the room,
old George stood, fumbling his hat in his hand, smiling
helplessly at the dark faces that met his. He muttered something
under his breath. "What's that?" asked Connor sharply. "I said,
a gentleman&mdash;" began old George, then lapsed into silence.
"What gentleman?" asked Connor roughly.</p>

<p>"I am speaking of myself," said the old man, and there came
into his face a curious expression of dignity. "I say, and I
maintain, that a gentleman is a gentleman whatever company he
affects. At my old college I once reproved an undergraduate." He
was speaking with stately, almost pompous distinctness. "I said,
'There is an axiom to which I would refer you, De gustibus non
est disputandum, and&mdash;and&mdash;'"</p>

<p>His shaking fingers went up again to the tell-tale mouth, and
the vacant smile came back.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Connor, shaking his arm, "we don't want to
know anything about your damned college; we want to know how
Angel got into our crib."</p>

<p>The old man looked puzzled. "Yes, yes," he muttered; "of
course, Mr. Connor, you have been most kind&mdash;the
crib&mdash;ah!&mdash;the young man who wanted to rent or hire
the room upstairs."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Connor eagerly.</p>

<p>"A most admirable young man," old George rambled on, "but
very inquisitive. I remember once, when I was addressing a large
congregation of young men at Cheltenham&mdash;or it may have
been young ladies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Curse the man!" cried Goyle in a fury. "Make him answer, or
stop his mouth."</p>

<p>Connor warned him back. "Let him talk in his own way," he
said.</p>

<p>"This admirable person," the old man went on, happily
striking on the subject again, "desired information that I was
not disposed to give, Mr. Connor, remembering your many
kindnesses, particularly in respect to one Mr. Vinnis."</p>

<p>"Yes, go on," urged Connor, and the face of Vinnis was
tense.</p>

<p>"I fear there are times when my usually active mind takes on
a sluggishness which is foreign to my character&mdash;my normal
character"&mdash;old George was again the pedant&mdash;"when the
unobservant stranger might be deceived into regarding me as a
negligible quantity. The admirable young man so far treated me
as such as to remark to his companion that there was a
rope&mdash;yes, distinctly a rope&mdash;for the said Mr.
Vinnis."</p>

<p>The face of Vinnis was livid.</p>

<p>"And," asked Connor, "What happened next? There were two of
them, were there?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded gravely; he nodded a number of times, as
though the exercise pleased him. "The other young man&mdash;not
the amiable one, but another&mdash;upon finding that I could not
rent or hire the rooms&mdash;as indeed I could not, Mr. Connor,
without your permission&mdash;engaged me in
conversation&mdash;very loudly he spoke, too&mdash;on the
relative values of cabbage and carrot as food for herbaceous
mammals. Where the amiable gentleman was at that moment I cannot
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can guess," thought Connor.</p>

<p>"I can remember the occasion well," old George continued,
"because that night I was alarmed and startled by strange noises
from the empty rooms upstairs, which I very naturally and
properly concluded were caused&mdash;" He stopped, and glancing
fearfully about the room, went on in a lower tone. "By certain
spirits," he whispered mysteriously, and pointed and leered
first at one and then another of the occupants of the room.
There was something very eerie in the performance of the strange
old man with the queerly working face, and more than one
hardened criminal present shivered a little.</p>

<p>Connor broke the silence that fell on the room. "So that's
how it was done, eh? One held you in conversation while the
other got upstairs and hid himself? Well, boys, you've heard the
old man. What d'ye say?" Vinnis shifted in his seat and turned
his great unemotional face to where the old man stood, still
fumbling with his hat and muttering to himself beneath his
breath; in some strange region whither his poor wandering mind
had taken him he was holding a conversation with an imaginary
person. Connor could see his eyebrows working, and caught scraps
of sentences, now in some strange dead tongue, now in the
stilted English of the schoolmaster. It was Vinnis who spoke for
the assembled company.</p>

<p>"The old man knows a darned sight too much," he said in his
level tone.</p>

<p>"I'm for&mdash;" He did not finish his sentence. Connor took
a swift survey of the men. "If there is any man here," he said
slowly, "who wants to wake up at seven o'clock in the morning
and meet a gentleman who will strap his hands behind him and a
person who will pray over him&mdash;if there's any man here that
wants a short walk after breakfast between two lines of warders
to a little shed where a brand new rope is hanging from the
roof, he's at liberty to do what he likes with old George, but
not in this house."</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on Vinnis. "And if there's any man here,"
he went on, "who's already in the shadow of the rope, so that
one or two murders more won't make much difference one way or
the other, he can do as he likes&mdash;outside this house."</p>

<p>Vinnis shrank back. "There's nothing against me," he
growled.</p>

<p>"The rope," muttered the old man, "Vinnis for the rope," he
chuckled to himself. "I fear they counted too implicitly upon
the fact that I am not always quite
myself&mdash;Vinnis&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man he spoke of sprang to his feet with a snarl like a
trapped beast.</p>

<p>"Sit down, you." Bat Sands, with his red head close cropped,
thrust his chair in the direction of the infuriated Vinnis.
"What Connor says is true&mdash;we're not going to croak the old
man, and we're not going to croak ourselves. If we hang, it will
be something worth hanging for. As to the old man, he's soft,
an' that's all you can say. He's got to be kept
close&mdash;"</p>

<p>A rap at the door cut him short. "Who's that?" he
whispered.</p>

<p>Connor tiptoed to the locked door. "Who's there?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>A familiar voice reassured him, and he opened the door and
held a conversation in a low voice with somebody outside.
"There's a man who wants to see me," he said in explanation.
"Lock the door after I leave, Bat," and he went out quickly. Not
a word was spoken, but each after his own fashion of reasoning
drew some conclusion from Connor's hasty departure.</p>

<p>"A full meetin'," croaked a voice from the back of the room.
"We're all asked here by Connor. Is it a plant?"</p>

<p>That was Bat's thought too. "No," he said; "there's nothin'
against us. Why, Angel let us off only last week because there
wasn't evidence, an' Connor's straight."</p>

<p>"I don't trust him, by God!" said Vinnis. "I trust nobody,"
said Bat doggedly, "but Connor's straight&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a rap on the door. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>"All right!" said the muffled voice. Bat unlocked the door,
and Connor came in. What he had seen or what he had heard had
brought about a marvellous change in his appearance&mdash;his
cheeks were a dull red, and his eyes blazed with triumph.
"Boys," he said, and they caught the infectious thrill in his
voice, "I've got the biggest thing for you&mdash;a million
pounds, share and share alike."</p>

<p>He felt rather than heard the excitement his words caused. He
stood with his back to the half-opened door.</p>

<p>"I'm going to introduce a new pal," he rattled on
breathlessly. "I'll vouch for him."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Bat. "Do we know him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Connor, "and you're not expected to know him. But
he's putting up the money, and that's good enough for you,
Bat&mdash;a hundred pounds a man, and it will be paid tonight."
Bat Sands spat on his hand. "Bring him in. He's good enough,"
and there was a murmur of approval. Connor disappeared for a
moment, and returned followed by a well-dressed stranger, who
met the questioning glances of his audience with a quiet
smile.</p>

<p>His eyes swept over every face. They rested for a moment on
Vinnis, they looked doubtfully at old George, who, seated on a
chair with crossed legs and his head bent, was talking with
great rapidity in an undertone to himself.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the stranger, "I have come with the object
of gaining your help. Mr. Connor has told me that he has already
informed you about Reale's millions. Briefly, I have decided to
forestall other people, and secure the money for myself. I offer
you a half share of the money, to be equally divided amongst
you, and as an earnest of my intention, I am paying each man who
is willing to help me a hundred pounds down."</p>

<p>He drew from one of his pockets a thick package of notes, and
from two other pockets similar bundles. He handed them to
Connor, and the hungry eyes of the "Borough Lot" focused upon
the crinkling paper.</p>

<p>"What I shall ask you to do," the stranger proceeded, "I
shall tell you later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," interrupted Bat. "Who else is in this?"</p>

<p>"We alone," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Is Jimmy in it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is Angel in it?"</p>

<p>"No" (impatiently).</p>

<p>"Go on," said Bat, satisfied.</p>

<p>"The money is in a safe that can only be opened by a word.
That word nobody knows&mdash;so far. The clue to the word was
stolen a few nights ago from the lawyer in charge of the case
by&mdash;Jimmy." He paused to note the effect of his words.</p>

<p>"Jimmy has passed the clue on to Scotland Yard, and we cannot
hope to get it."</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Bat.</p>

<p>"What we can do," the other went on, "is to open the safe
with something more powerful than a word."</p>

<p>"But the guard!" said Bat. "There's an armed guard kept there
by the lawyer."</p>

<p>"We can arrange about the guard," said the other.</p>

<p>"Why not get at the lawyer?" It was Curt Goyle who made the
suggestion.</p>

<p>The stranger frowned. "The lawyer cannot be got at," he said
shortly. "Now, are you with me?"</p>

<p>There was no need to ask. Connor was sorting the notes into
little bundles on the table, and the men came up one by one,
took their money, and after a few words with Connor took their
leave, with an awkward salutation to the stranger.</p>

<p>Bat was the last to go. "Tomorrow night&mdash;here," muttered
Connor.</p>

<p>He was left alone with the newcomer, save for the old man,
who hadn't changed his attitude, and was still in the midst of
some imaginary conversation.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" the stranger demanded.</p>

<p>Connor smiled. "An old chap as mad as a March hare. A
gentleman, too, and a scholar; talks all sorts of mad
languages&mdash;Latin and Greek and the Lord knows what. He's
been a schoolmaster, I should say, and what brought him down to
this&mdash;drink or drugs or just ordinary madness&mdash;I don't
know."</p>

<p>The stranger looked with interest at the unconscious man, and
old George, as if suddenly realizing that he was under scrutiny,
woke up with a start and sat blinking at the other. Then he
shuffled slowly to his feet and peered closely into the
stranger's face, all the time sustaining his mumbled
conversation.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said in a voice rising from its inaudibility, "a
gentleman! Pleased to meet you, sir, pleased to meet you. Omnia
mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis, but you have not changed." He
relapsed again into mutterings.</p>

<p>"I have never met him before," the stranger said, turning to
Connor.</p>

<p>"Oh, old George always thinks he has met people," said Connor
with a grin.</p>

<p>"A gentleman," old George muttered, "every inch a gentleman,
and a munificent patron. He bought a copy of my book&mdash;you
have read it? It is called&mdash;dear me, I have forgotten what
it is called&mdash;and sent to consult me in his&mdash;ah!
&mdash;anagram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" The stranger's face was ashen, and he gripped Connor
by the arm.</p>

<p>"Listen, listen!" he whispered fiercely. Old George threw up
his head again and stared blandly at the stranger.</p>

<p>"A perfect gentleman," he said with pathetic insolence,
"invariably addressing me as the 'professor'&mdash;a most
delicate and gentlemanly thing to do."</p>

<p>He pointed a triumphant linger to the stranger. "I know you!"
he cried shrilly, and his cracked laugh rang through the room.
"Spedding, that's your name! Lawyer, too. I saw you in the
carriage of my patron."</p>

<p>"The book, the book!" gasped Spedding. "What was the name of
your book?" Old George's voice had dropped to its normal level
when he replied with extravagant courtesy&mdash;"That is the one
thing, sir, I can never remember."</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE GREAT
ATTEMPT</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE are supercilious critics who sneer at
Scotland Yard. They are quite unofficial critics, of course,
writers of stories wherein figure amateur detectives of abnormal
perspicuity, unravelling mysteries with consummate ease which
have baffled the police for years. As a matter of fact, Scotland
Yard stands for the finest police organization in the world.
People who speak glibly of "police blunders" might remember one
curious fact: in this last quarter of a century only one man has
ever stood in the dock at the Old Bailey under the capital
charge who has escaped the dread sentence of the law. Scotland
Yard is patiently slow and terribly sure.</p>

<p>Angel in his little room received a letter written in a
sprawling, uneducated hand; it was incoherent and stained with
tears and underlined from end to end. He read it through and
examined the date stamp, then rang his bell. The messenger who
answered him found him examining a map of London.</p>

<p>"Go to the Record Office, and get EB. 93", he said, and in
five minutes the messenger came back with a thick folder bulging
with papers. There were newspaper cuttings and plans and
dreadful photographs, the like of which the outside world do not
see, and there was a little key ticketed with an
inscription.</p>

<p>Angel looked through the dossier carefully, then read the
woman's letter again ...</p>

<p>Vinnis, the man with the dead-white face, finishing his late
breakfast, and with the pleasurable rustle of new banknotes in
his trouser pocket, strolled forth into Commercial Road, E. An
acquaintance leaning against a public-house gave him a curt nod
of recognition; a bedraggled girl hurrying homeward with her
man's breakfast in her apron shrank on one side, knowing Vinnis
to her sorrow; a stray cur cringed up to him, as he stood for a
moment at the edge of the road, and was kicked for its pains.
Vinnis was entirely without sentiment, and besides, even though
the money in his pocket compensated for most things, the memory
of old George and his babbling talk worried him.</p>

<p>Somebody on the other side of the road attracted his
attention. It was a woman, and he knew her very well, therefore
he ignored her beckoning hand. Two days ago he had occasion to
reprove her, and he had seized the opportunity to summarily
dissolve the informal union that had kept them together for five
years. So he made no sign when the woman with the bruised face
called him, but turned abruptly and walked towards Aldgate. He
did not look round, but by and by he heard the patter of her
feet behind, and once his name called hoarsely. He struck off
into a side street with a raging devil inside him, then when
they reached an unfrequented part of the road he turned on
her.</p>

<p>She saw the demon in his eyes, and tried to speak. She was a
penitent woman at that moment, and hysterically ripe for
confession, but the savage menace of the man froze her lips.</p>

<p>"So," he said, his thin mouth askew, "so after what I've said
an' what I've done you follow me, do you. Showing me up in the
street, eh!" He edged closer to her, his fist doubled, and she,
poor drab, fascinated by the snakelike glare of his dull eyes,
stood rooted to the spot. Then with a snarl he struck
her&mdash;once, twice&mdash;and she fell a huddled, moaning heap
on the pavement.</p>

<p>You may do things in Commercial Road, E., after "lighting-up
time" that are not permissible in the broad light of the day,
unless it be Saturday, and the few people who had been attracted
by the promise of a row were indignant but passive, after the
manner of all London crowds. Not so one quiet, middle-aged man,
who confronted Vinnis as he began to walk away.</p>

<p>"That was a particularly brutal thing to do," said the quiet
man. Vinnis measured him with his eye, and decided that this was
not a man to be trifled with.</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to say to you," he said roughly, and tried
to push past, but an iron grip was on his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, my friend," said the other steadily, "not so
fast; you cannot commit a brutal assault in the open street like
that without punishment. I must ask you to walk with me to the
station."</p>

<p>"Suppose I won't go?" demanded Vinnis.</p>

<p>"I shall take you," said the other. "I am Detective-Sergeant
Jarvis from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>Vinnis thought rapidly. There wasn't much chance of escape;
the street they were in was a cul-de-sac, and at the open end
two policemen had made their appearance. After all, a "wife"
assault was not a serious business, and the woman&mdash;well,
she would swear it was an accident. He resolved to go quietly;
at the worst it would be a month, so with a shrug of his
shoulders he accompanied the detective. A small crowd followed
them to the station. In the little steel dock he stood in his
stockinged feet whilst a deft jailer ran his hands over him.
With a stifled oath, he remembered the money in his possession;
it was only ten pounds, for he had secreted the other, but ten
pounds is a lot of money to be found on a person of his class,
and generally leads to embarrassing inquiries. To his
astonishment, the jailer who relieved him of the notes seemed in
no whit surprised, and the inspector at the desk took the
discovery as a matter of course. Vinnis remarked on the
surprising number of constables there were on duty in the charge
room. Then&mdash;"What is the charge?" asked the inspector,
dipping his pen. "Wilful murder!" said a voice, and Angel
Esquire crossed the room from the inspector's office. "I charge
this man with having on the night of the 17th of February..."
Vinnis, dumb with terror and rage, listened to the crisp tones
of the detective as he detailed the particulars of an almost
forgotten crime. It was the story of a country house burglary, a
man-servant who surprised the thief, a light in the dark, a shot
and a dead man lying in the big drawing-room. It was an ordinary
little tragedy, forgotten by everybody save Scotland Yard; but
year by year unknown men had pieced together the scraps of
evidence that had come to them; strand by strand had the rope
been woven that was to hang a cold-blooded murderer; last of all
came the incoherent letter from a jealous woman&mdash;Scotland
Yard waits always for a jealous woman&mdash;and the evidence was
complete.</p>

<p>"Put him in No. 14", said the inspector. Then Vinnis woke up,
and the six men on duty in the charge room found their time
fully occupied. Vinnis was arrested, as Angel Esquire put it,
"in the ordinary way of business."</p>

<p>Hundreds of little things happen daily at Scotland Yard in
the ordinary way of business which, apparently unconnected one
with the other, have an extraordinary knack of being in some
remote fashion related. A burglary at Clapham was remarkable for
the fact that a cumbersome mechanical toy was carried away in
addition to other booty. A street accident in the Kingsland Road
led to the arrest of a drunken carman. In the excitement of the
moment a sneak-thief purloined a parcel from the van, was chased
and captured. A weeping wife at the police station gave him a
good character as husband and father. "Only last week he brought
my boy a fine performin' donkey," An alert detective went home
with her, recognized the mechanical toy from the description,
and laid by the heels the notorious "Kingsland Road Lot."</p>

<p>The arrest of Vinnis was totally unconnected with Angel's
investigations into the mystery of Reale's millions. He knew him
as a "Borough man," but did not associate him with the search
for the word. None the less, there are certain formalities
attached to the arrest of all bad criminals. Angel Esquire
placed one or two minor matters in the hands of subordinates,
and in two days one of these waited upon him in his office. "The
notes, sir," said the man, "were issued to Mr. Spedding on his
private account last Monday morning. Mr. Spedding is a lawyer,
of the firm of Spedding, Mortimer and Larach."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Mr. Spedding?" he asked. "Yes, sir. Mr.
Spedding remembers drawing the money and paying it away to a
gentleman who was sailing to America."</p>

<p>"A client?"</p>

<p>"So far as I can gather," said the subordinate, "the money
was paid on behalf of a client for services. Mr. Spedding would
not particularize."</p>

<p>Angel Esquire made a little grimace. "Lawyers certainly do
queer things," he said dryly. "Does Mr. Spedding offer any
suggestion as to how the money came into this man's
possession?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He thinks he might have obtained it quite honestly.
I understand that the man who received the money was a shady
sort of customer."</p>

<p>"So I should imagine," said Angel Esquire. Left alone, he sat
in deep thought drawing faces on his blotting&mdash;pad. Then he
touched a bell.</p>

<p>"Send Mr. Carter to me," he directed, and in a few minutes a
bright-faced youth, lingering an elementary moustache, was
awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>"Carter," said Angel cautiously, "it must be very dull work
in the finger-print department?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," said the other, a fairly enthusiastic
ethnologist, "we've got-"</p>

<p>"Carter," said Angel more cautiously still, "are you on for a
lark?"</p>

<p>"Like a bird, sir," said Carter, unconsciously humorous.</p>

<p>"I want a dozen men, the sort of men who won't talk to
reporters, and will remain 'unofficial' so long as I want them
to be," said Angel, and he unfolded his plan. When the younger
man had gone Angel drew a triangle on the blotting-pad.
"Spedding is in with the 'Borough Lot'", he put a cross against
one angle.</p>

<p>"Spedding knows I know," he put a cross at the apex. "I know
that Spedding knows I know," he marked the remaining angle.
"It's Spedding's move, and he'll move damn quick."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner came into the room at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Angel!" he said, glancing at the figures on the pad.
"What's this, a new game?"</p>

<p>"It's an old game," said Angel truthfully, "but played in an
entirely new way."</p>

<p>Angel was not far wrong when he surmised that Spedding's move
would be immediate, and although the detective had reckoned
without an unknown factor, in the person of old George, yet a
variety of circumstances combined to precipitate the act that
Angel anticipated. Not least of these was the arrest of Vinnis.
After his interview with old George, Spedding had decided on a
waiting policy. The old man had been taken to the house at
Clapham. Spedding had been prepared to wait patiently until some
freak of mind brought back the memory to the form of cryptogram
he had advised. A dozen times a day he asked the old
man&mdash;"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Old George, only old George," was the invariable reply, with
many grins and noddings.</p>

<p>"But your real name, the name you had when you were a
professor." But this would only start the old man off on a
rambling reminiscence of his "munificent patron."</p>

<p>Connor came secretly to Clapham for orders. It was the night
after Vinnis had been arrested. "We've got to move at once, Mr.
Connor," said the lawyer. Connor sat in the chair that had held
Jimmy a few nights previous.</p>

<p>"It is no use waiting for the old man to talk, the earlier
plan was best."</p>

<p>"Has anything happened?" asked Connor. His one-time awe of
the lawyer had merged in the familiarity of conspiratorship.</p>

<p>"There was a detective at my office today inquiring about
some notes that were found on Vinnis. Angel Esquire will draw
his own conclusions, and we have no time to lose."</p>

<p>"We are ready," said Connor. "Then let it be tomorrow night.
I will withdraw the guard of commissionaires at the safe. I can
easily justify myself afterwards."</p>

<p>An idea struck Connor. "Why not send another lot of men to
relieve them? I can fix up some of the boys so that they'll look
like commissionaires."</p>

<p>Spedding's eyes narrowed. "Yes," he said slowly, "it could be
arranged&mdash;an excellent idea." He paced the room with long,
swinging strides, his forehead puckered. "There are two
reliefs," he said, "one in the morning and one in the evening. I
could send a note to the sergeant of the morning relief telling
him that I had arranged for a new set of night men&mdash;I have
changed them twice already, one cannot be too careful&mdash;and
I could give you the necessary authority to take over
charge."</p>

<p>"Better still," said Connor, "instruct him to withdraw,
leaving the place empty, then our arrival will attract no
notice. Lombard Street must be used to the commissionaires going
on guard."</p>

<p>"That is an idea," said Spedding, and sat down to write the
letter.</p>

<p>The night of the great project turned out miserably wet. "So
much the better," muttered Connor, viewing the world from his
Kensington fastness. The room dedicated to the use of the master
of the house was plainly furnished, and on the bare deal table
Connor had set his whisky down whilst he peered through the
rain-blurred windows at the streaming streets.</p>

<p>"England for work and Egypt for pleasure," he muttered; "and
if I get my share of the money, and it will be a bigger share
than my friend Spedding imagines, it's little this cursed
country will see of Mr. Patrick Connor."</p>

<p>He drained oft his whisky at a gulp, rubbed the steam from
the windows, and looked down into the deserted street. Two men
were walking toward the house. One, well covered by a heavy
mackintosh cloak, moved with a long stride; the other, wrapped
in a new overcoat, shuffled by his side, quickening his steps to
keep up with his more energetic companion.</p>

<p>"Spedding," said Connor, "and old George. What is he bringing
him here for?" He hurried downstairs to let them in. "Well?"
asked Spedding, throwing his reeking coat off.</p>

<p>"All's ready," answered Connor. "Why have you brought the old
man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for company," the lawyer answered carelessly. If the
truth be told, Spedding still hoped that the old man would
remember. That day old George had been exceedingly garrulous,
almost lucidly so at times. Mr. Spedding still held on to the
faint hope that the old man's revelations would obviate the
necessity for employing the "Borough Lot," and what was more
important, for sharing the contents of the safe with them. As to
this latter part of the program, Mr. Spedding had plans which
would have astonished Connor had he but known. But old George's
loquacity stopped short at the all-important point of
instructing the lawyer on the question of the cryptogram. He had
brought him along in the hope that at the eleventh hour the old
man would reveal his identity. Unconscious of the responsibility
that lay upon his foolish head, the old man sat in the upstairs
room communing with himself.</p>

<p>"We will leave him here," said the lawyer, "he will be
safe."</p>

<p>"Safe enough. I know him of old. He'll sit here for hours
amusing himself."</p>

<p>"And now, what about the men?" asked the lawyer. "Where do we
meet them?"</p>

<p>"We shall pick them up at the corner of Lombard Street, and
they'll follow me to the Safe Deposit."</p>

<p>"Ah!" They turned swiftly on old George, who with his chin
raised and with face alert was staring at them. "Safe Deposit,
Lombard Street," he mumbled. "And a most excellent plan
too&mdash;a most excellent plan."</p>

<p>The two men held their breath. "And quite an ingenious idea,
sir. Did you say Lombard Street&mdash;a safe?" he muttered. "A
safe with a word? And how to conceal the word, that's the
question. I am a man of honour, you may trust me." He made a
sweeping bow to some invisible presence. "Why not conceal your
word thus?" Old George stabbed the palm of his hand with a grimy
forefinger.</p>

<p>"Why not? Have you read my book? It is only a little book,
but useful, sir, remarkably useful. The drawings and the signs
are most accurate. An eminent gentleman at the British Museum
assisted me in its preparation. It is called&mdash;it is
called&mdash;" He passed his hand wearily over his head, and
slid down into his chair again, a miserable old man muttering
foolishly.</p>

<p>Spedding wiped the perspiration from his forehead. "Nearly,
nearly!" he said huskily. "By Heavens! he nearly told us."</p>

<p>Connor looked at him with suspicion.</p>

<p>"What's all this about the book?" he demanded. "This is the
second time old George has spoken like this. It's to do with old
Reale, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Spedding nodded.</p>

<p>"Come," said Connor, looking at his watch, "it's time we were
moving. We'll leave the old man to look after the house. Here,
George."</p>

<p>Old George looked up. "You'll stay here, and not leave till
we return. D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear, Mr. Connor, sir," said old George, with his curious
assumption of dignity, "and hearing, obey."</p>

<p>As the two men turned into the night the rain pelted down and
a gusty northwesterly wind blew into their faces.</p>

<p>"George," said Connor, answering a question, "oh, we've had
him for years. One of the boys found him wandering about
Limehouse with hardly any clothes to his back, and brought him
to us. That was before I knew the 'Borough Lot,' but they used
him as a blind. He was worth the money it cost to keep him in
food."</p>

<p>Spedding kept the other waiting whilst he dispatched a long
telegram from the Westbourne Grove Post Office. It was addressed
to the master of the Polecat lying at Cardiff, and was
reasonably unintelligible to the clerk. They found a hansom at
the corner of Queen's Road, and drove to the Bank; here they
alighted and crossed to the Royal Exchange. Some men in uniform
overcoats who were standing about exchanged glances with Connor,
and as the two leaders doubled back to Lombard Street, followed
them at a distance.</p>

<p>"The guard left at four o'clock," said Spedding, fitting the
key of the heavy outer door. He waited a few minutes in the inky
black darkness of the vestibule whilst Connor admitted the six
uniformed men who had followed them.</p>

<p>"Are we all here?" said Connor in a low voice. "Bat? Here!
Goyle? Here! Lamby? Here!" One by one he called them by their
names and they answered.</p>

<p>"We may as well have a light," said Spedding, and felt for
the switch. The gleam of the electric lamps showed Spedding as
pure a collection of scoundrels as ever disgraced the uniform of
a gallant corps.</p>

<p>"Now," said Spedding in level tones, "are all the necessary
tools here?"</p>

<p>Bat's grin was the answer. "If we can get an electric
connection," he said, "we'll burn out the lock of the safe in
half&mdash;"</p>

<p>Spedding had walked to the inner door that led to the great
hall, and was fumbling with the keys. Suddenly he started back.
"Hark!" he whispered. "I heard a step in the hall."</p>

<p>Connor listened. "I hear nothing," he began, when the inner
door was thrown open, and a commissionaire, revolver in hand,
stepped out.</p>

<p>"Stand!" he cried. Then, recognizing Spedding, dropped the
muzzle of his pistol.</p>

<p>White with rage, Spedding stood amidst his ill-assorted
bodyguard. In the searching white light of the electric lamps
there was no mistaking their character. He saw the
commissionaire eying them curiously.</p>

<p>"I understood," he said slowly, "that the guard had been
relieved."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the man, and the cluster of uniformed men at
the door of the inner hall confirmed this.</p>

<p>"I sent orders this afternoon," said Spedding between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"No orders have been received, sir," and the lawyer saw the
scrutinizing eye of the soldierly sentry pass over his
confederates. "Is this the relief?" asked the guard, not
attempting to conceal the contempt in his tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>As the sentry saluted and disappeared into the hall Spedding
drew Connor aside.</p>

<p>"This is ruin," he said quickly. "The safe must be cleared
tonight. Tomorrow London will not hold me."</p>

<p>The sentry reappeared at the doorway and beckoned them in.
They shuffled into the great hall, where in the half darkness
the safe loomed up from its rocky pedestal, an eerie, mysterious
thing. He saw Bat Sands glancing uncomfortably around the dim
spaces of the building, and felt the impression of the
loneliness.</p>

<p>A man who wore the stripes of a sergeant came up.</p>

<p>"Are we to withdraw, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Spedding shortly.</p>

<p>"Will you give us a written order?" asked the man.</p>

<p>Spedding hesitated, then drew out a pocket-book and wrote a
few hasty words on a sheet, tore it out, and handed it to the
man. The sergeant looked at it carefully.</p>

<p>"You haven't signed it or dated it either," he said
respectfully, and handed it back. Spedding cursed him under his
breath and rectified the omissions.</p>

<p>"Now you may go." In the half-light, for only one solitary
electrolier illuminated the vast hall, he thought the man was
smiling. It might have been a trick of the shadows, for he could
not see his face.</p>

<p>"And am I to leave you alone?" said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it safe?" the non-commissioned officer asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Curse you, what do you mean?" cried the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Well," said the other easily, "I see you have Connor with
you, a notorious thief and blackmailer." The lawyer was dumb.
"And Bat Sands. How d'ye do, Bat? How did they treat you in
Borstal, or was it Parkhurst?" drawled the sergeant.</p>

<p>"And there's the gentle Lamby trying hard to look military in
an overcoat too large for him. That's not the uniform you're
used to wearing, Lamby, eh?" From the group of men at the door
came a genuinely amused laugh.</p>

<p>"Guard the outer door, one of you chaps," said the sergeant,
and turning again to Spedding's men, "Here we have our respected
friend Curt Goyle." He stooped and picked up a bag that Bat had
placed gingerly on the floor. "What a bag of tricks," the
sergeant cooed, "diamond bits and dynamite cartridges
and&mdash;what's this little thing, Bat&mdash;an ark? It is. By
Jove, I congratulate you on the swag."</p>

<p>Spedding had recovered his nerve and strode forward. He was
playing for the greatest stake in the world. "You shall be
punished for this insolence," he stormed.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the imperturbable sergeant.</p>

<p>Somebody at the door spoke. "Here's another one, sergeant,"
and pushed a queer old figure into the hall, a figure that
blinked and peered from face to face.</p>

<p>He espied Spedding, and ran up to him almost fawning.</p>

<p>"The Safe Deposit&mdash;in Lombard Street," he cackled
joyously. "You see, I remembered, dear friend; and I've come to
tell you about the book&mdash;my book, you know. My munificent
patron who desired a puzzle word&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sergeant started forward. "My God!" he cried, "the
professor."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," chuckled the old man, "that's what he called me.
He bought a copy of my book&mdash;two sovereigns, four
sovereigns he gave me. The book&mdash;what was it called?" The
old man paused and clasped both hands to his head.</p>

<p>"A Study&mdash;a Study," he said painfully, "on the Origin
of&mdash;the Alphabet. Ah!"</p>

<p>Another of the commissionaires had come forward as the old
man began speaking, and to him the sergeant turned.</p>

<p>"Make a note of that, Jimmy," the sergeant said.</p>

<p>Spedding reeled back as though he had been struck.</p>

<p>"Angel!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"That's me," was the ungrammatical reply.</p>

<p>Crushed, cowed, beaten and powerless, Spedding awaited
judgment.</p>

<p>What form it would take he could not guess, that it would
effectively ruin him he did not doubt. The trusted lawyer stood
self-condemned; there was no explaining away his companions,
there could be no mistaking the meaning of their presence.</p>

<p>"Send your men away," said Angel. A wild hope seized the
lawyer. The men were not to be arrested, there was a chance for
him. The "Borough Lot" needed no second ordering; they trooped
through the doorway, anxious to reach the open air before Angel
changed his mind.</p>

<p>"You may go," said Angel to Connor, who still lingered.</p>

<p>"If the safe is to be opened, I'm in it," was the sullen
reply.</p>

<p>"You may go," said Angel; "the safe will not be opened
tonight."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go!" thundered the detective, and Connor slunk away.</p>

<p>Angel beckoned the commissionaire who had first interrogated
Spedding.</p>

<p>"Take charge of that bag, Carter. There are all sorts of
things in it that go off." Then he turned to the lawyer. "Mr.
Spedding, there is a great deal that I have to say to you, but
it would be better to defer our conversation; the genuine guard
will return in a few minutes. I told them to return at 10
o'clock."</p>

<p>"By what authority?" blustered Spedding.</p>

<p>"Tush!" said Angel wearily. "Surely we have got altogether
beyond that stage. Your order for withdrawal was expected by me.
I waited upon the sergeant of the guard with another order."</p>

<p>"A forged order, I gather?" said Spedding, recovering his
balance. "Now I see why you have allowed my men to go. I
overrated your generosity."</p>

<p>"The order," said Angel soberly, "was signed by His Majesty's
Secretary of State for Home Affairs"&mdash;he tapped the
astonished lawyer on the shoulder&mdash;"and if it would
interest you to know, I have a warrant in my pocket for the
arrest of every man jack of you. That I do not put it into
execution is a matter of policy."</p>

<p>The lawyer scanned the calm face of the detective in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Your presence at Jimmy's flat at ten o'clock tomorrow
morning," replied Angel.</p>

<p>"I will be there," said the other, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"And, Mr. Spedding," called Jimmy, as the lawyer reached the
door, "in regard to a boat you have chartered from Cardiff, I
think you need not go any further in the matter. One of my men
is at present interviewing the captain, and pointing out to him
the enormity of the offence of carrying fugitives from justice
to Spanish-American ports."</p>

<p>"Damn you!" said Spedding, and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Jimmy removed the commissionaire's cap from his head and
grinned. "One of these fine days, Angel, you'll lose your job,
introducing the Home Secretary's name. Phew!"</p>

<p>"It had to be done," said Angel sadly. "It hurts me to lie,
but I couldn't very well tell Spedding that the sergeant of the
commissionaires had been one of my own men all along, could
I?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">X. &mdash; SOME BAD
CHARACTERS</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT happened that on the night of the great
attempt the inquisitive Mr. Lane, of 76 Cawdor Street, was
considerably exercised in his mind as to the depleted condition
of his humble treasury. With Mr. Lane the difference between
affluence and poverty was a matter of shillings. His line of
business was a humble one. Lead piping and lengths of telephone
wire, an occasional door-mat improvidently left outside whilst
the servant cleaned the hall, these represented the scope and
extent of his prey. Perhaps he reached his zenith when he lifted
an overcoat from a hatstand that time a benevolent old lady was
cutting him thick slices of bread and butter in a basement
kitchen. Mr. Lane had only recently returned from a short stay
in Wormwood Scrubbs Prison. It was over a trifling affair of
horsehair abstracted from railway carriage cushions that
compelled Mr. Lane's retirement for two months. It was that same
affair that brought about his undoing on the night of the
attempt. For the kudos of the railway theft had nerved him to
more ambitious attempts, and with a depleted exchequer to urge
him forward, and the prestige of his recent achievements to
support him, he decided upon burglary. It was a wild and
reckless departure from his regular line, and he did not stop to
consider the disabilities attaching to a change of profession,
nor debate the unpropitious conditions of an already overstocked
labour market. It is reasonable to suppose that Mr. Lane lacked
the necessary qualities of logic and balance to argue any point
to its obvious conclusion, for he was, intellectually, the
reverse of brilliant, and was therefore ill-equipped for
introspective or psychological examination of the circumstances
leading to his decision. Communing with himself, the inquisitive
Mr. Lane put the matter tersely and brutally.</p>

<p>"Lead pipin's no go unless you've got a pal to work with;
telephone wires is so covered up with wood casin' that it's
worse'n hard work to pinch two-penn'oth. I'm goin' to have a cut
at Joneses."</p>

<p>So in the pelting rain he watched "Joneses" from a convenient
doorway. He noted with satisfaction the "workmen" departing one
by one; he observed with joy the going of "Jones" himself; and
when, some few minutes afterwards, the queer-looking old man,
whom he suspected as being a sort of caretaker, came shuffling
out, slamming the gate behind him, and peering left and right,
and mumbling to himself as he squelched through the rain, the
watcher regarded the removal of this final difficulty as being
an especial act of Providence. He waited for another half hour,
because, for some reason or other, the usually deserted street
became annoyingly crowded. First came a belated coal cart and a
miserably bedraggled car-man who cried his wares dolefully. Then
a small boy, escaping from the confines of his domestic circle,
came to revel in the downpour and wade ecstatically but
thoroughly through the puddles that had formed on the uneven
surface of the road. Nemesis, in the shape of a shrill-voiced
mother, overtook the boy and sent him whining and expectant to
the heavy hand of maternal authority.</p>

<p>With the coast clear Mr. Lane lost no time. In effecting an
entrance to the head-quarters of the "Borough Lot," Mr. Lane's
method lacked subtlety. He climbed over the gate leading to the
yard, trusting inwardly that he was not observed, but taking his
chance. Had he been an accomplished burglar, with the experience
of any exploits behind him, he would have begun by making a very
thorough inspection of likely windows. Certainly he would never
have tried the "office" door. Being the veriest tyro, and being
conscious, moreover, that his greatest feats had connection with
doors carelessly left ajar, he tried the door, and to his
delight it opened. Again the skilled craftsman would have
suspected some sort of treachery, and might have withdrawn; but
Mr. Lane, recognizing in the fact that the old man had forgotten
to fasten the door behind him only yet another proof of that
benevolent Providence which exerts itself for the express
service of men "in luck," entered boldly. He lit a candle stump
and looked around. The evidence of that wealth which is the
particular possession of "master-men" was not evident. Indeed,
the floor of the passage was uncarpeted, and the walls bare of
picture or ornament. Nor was the "office," a little room leading
from the "passage," any more prolific of result. Such fixtures
as there were had apparently been left behind by the previous
tenant, and these were thick with dust. "Bah!" said the
inquisitive Mr. Lane scornfully, and his words echoed hollowly
as in an empty house. With the barren possibilities of his
exploit before him, Mr. Lane's spirits fell. He was of the
class, to whom reference has already been made, that looked in
awe and reverence toward the "Borough Lot" in the same spirit as
the youthful curate might regard the consistory of bishops. In
his cups&mdash;pewter cups they were with frothing heads
a-top&mdash;he was wont to boast that his connection with the
"Borough Lot" was both close and intimate. A rumour that went
around to the effect that the "mouthpiece" who defended him at
the closing of the unsatisfactory horsehair episode had been
paid for by the "Borough Lot" he did not trouble to contradict.
If he had known any of them, even by sight, he would not at that
moment have been effecting a burglarious entry into their
premises. Room after room he searched. He found the ill-furnished
bedroom of Connor, and the room where old George slept
on an uncleanly mattress. He found, too, the big room where the
"Lot" held their informal meetings, but nothing portable.
Nothing that a man might slip under his coat, and walk boldly
out of the front door with.</p>

<p>He heard another voice speaking in a lower tone.</p>

<p>"What are we worth? You're a fool! What d'ye think we're
worth? Ain't we the 'Borough Lot'? Don't he know enough to hang
two or three of us... It's Connor and his pal the lawyer..."</p>

<p>'The Borough Lot'! The paralyzing intelligence came to Mr.
Lane, and he held on to the bare mantelshelf for support. Spies!
Suppose they discovered him, and mistook him for a spy! His hair
rose at the thought. He knew them well enough by repute.
Overmuch hero-worship had invested them with qualities for evil
which they may or may not have possessed. There might be a
chance of escape. The tumult below continued. Scraps of angry
talk came floating up. Mr. Lane looked out of the window; the
drop into the street was too long, and there was no sign of rope
in the house. Cautiously he opened the door of the room. The men
were in the room beneath that in which he stood. The staircase
that led to the street must take him past their door. Mr. Lane
was very anxious to leave the house. He had unwittingly stepped
into a hornets' nest, and wanted to make his escape without
disturbing the inmates. Now was the time&mdash;or never. Whilst
the angry argument continued a creaking stair board or so might
not attract attention. But he made no allowance for the gifts of
these men&mdash;gifts of sight and hearing. Bat Sands, in the
midst of his tirade, saw the uplifted finger and head-jerk of
Goyle. He did not check his flow of invective, but edged toward
the door; then he stopped short, and flinging the door open, he
caught the scared Mr. Lane by the throat, and dragging him into
the room, threw him upon the ground and knelt on him.</p>

<p>"What are ye doing here?" he whispered fiercely.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, with protruding eyes, saw the pitiless faces about
him, saw Goyle lift a life-preserver from the table and turn
half-round the better to strike, and fainted.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" growled Bat, with outstretched hand. "The little
swine has fainted. Who is he? Do any of you fellers know
him?"</p>

<p>It was the wizened-faced man whom Angel had addressed as
Lamby who furnished the identification. "He's a little
crook&mdash;name of Lane."</p>

<p>"Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hereabouts. He was in the Scrubbs in my time," said
Lamby. They regarded the unconscious burglar in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Go through his pockets," suggested Goyle. It
happened&mdash;and this was the most providential happening of
the day from Mr. Lane's point of view&mdash;that when he had
decided upon embarking on his career of high-class crime he had
thoughtfully provided himself with a few home-made instruments.
It was the little poker with flattened end to form a jemmy and
the centre-bit that was found in his pocket that in all
probability saved Mr. Lane's life. Lombroso and other great
criminologists have given it out that your true degenerate has
no sense of humour, but on two faces at least there was a broad
grin when the object of the little man's visit was revealed.</p>

<p>"He came to burgle Connor," said Bat admiringly. "Here, pass
over the whisky, one of ye!" He forced a little down the man's
throat, and Mr. Lane blinked and opened his eyes in a frightened
stare.</p>

<p>"Stand up," commanded Bat, "an' give an account of yourself,
young feller. What d'ye mean by breaking into&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," Goyle interrupted savagely. "What
has he heard when he was sneaking outside&mdash;that's the
question."</p>

<p>"Nothin', gentlemen!" gasped the unfortunate Mr. Lane, "on me
word, gentlemen! I've been in trouble like yourselves,
an'&mdash;" He realized he had blundered.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Goyle with ominous calm, "so you've been in
trouble like us, have you?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," hissed the other; "you mean you've
been listenin' to what we've been saying, you little skunk, and
you're ready to bleat to the first copper." It might have gone
hard with Mr. Lane but for the opportune arrival of the
messenger. Bat went downstairs at the knock, and the rest stood
quietly listening. They expected Connor, and when his voice did
not sound on the stairs they looked at one another
questioningly. Bat came into the room with a yellow envelope in
his hand. He passed it to Goyle. Reading was not an
accomplishment of his. Goyle read it with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Do the best you can," he read. "I'm lying doggo."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" snarled Goyle, holding the message in
his hand and looking at Bat.</p>

<p>"Hidin', is he&mdash;and we've got to do the best we
can?"</p>

<p>Bat reached for his overcoat. He did not speak as he
struggled into it, nor until he had buttoned it
deliberately.</p>

<p>"It means&mdash;git," he said shortly. "It means run, or else
it means time, an' worse than time."</p>

<p>He swung round to the door. "Connor's hidin'," he stopped to
say. "When Connor starts hiding the place is getting hot.
There's nothing against me so far as I know, except&mdash;"</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the form of Mr. Lane. He had raised himself
to a sitting position on the floor, and now, with dishevelled
hair and outstretched legs, he sat the picture of despair.</p>

<p>Goyle intercepted the glance. "What about him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Leave him," said Bat; "we've got no time for fooling with
him."</p>

<p>A motor-car came buzzing down Cawdor Street, which was
unusual. They heard the grind of its brakes outside the door,
and that in itself was sufficiently alarming. Bat extinguished
the light, and cautiously opened the shutters. He drew back with
an oath.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Goyle whispered. Bat made no reply, and they
heard him open his matchbox.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" whispered Goyle fiercely.</p>

<p>"Light the lamp," said the other. The tinkle of glass
followed as he removed the chimney, and in the yellow light Bat
faced the "Borough Lot."</p>

<p>"U&mdash;P spells 'up,' an' that's what the game is," he said
calmly.</p>

<p>He was searching his pockets as he spoke. "I want a light
because there's one or two things in my pocket that I've got to
burn&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>After some fumbling he found a paper. He gave it a swift
examination, then he struck a match and carefully lit the
corner.</p>

<p>"It's the fairest cop," he went on. "The street's full of
police, and Angel ain't playing 'gamblin' raids' this time."</p>

<p>There was a heavy knock on the door, but nobody moved.</p>

<p>Goyle's face had gone livid. He knew better than any man
there how impossible escape was. That had been one of the
drawbacks to the house&mdash;the ease with which it could be
surrounded. He had pointed out the fact to Connor before.</p>

<p>Again the knock. "Let 'em open it," said Bat grimly, and as
though the people outside had heard the invitation, the door
crashed in, and there came a patter as of men running on the
stairs.</p>

<p>First to enter the room was Angel. He nodded to Bat coolly,
then stepped aside to allow the policemen to follow.</p>

<p>"I want you," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Sands.</p>

<p>"Breaking and entering," said the detective. "Put out your
hands!"</p>

<p>Bat obeyed. As the steel stirrup-shaped irons snapped on his
wrists he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you got Connor?"</p>

<p>Angel smiled. "Connor lives to fight another day," he said
quietly. The policemen who attended him were busy with the other
occupants of the room.</p>

<p>"Bit of a field-day for you, Mr. Angel," said the thin-faced
Lamby pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Thought you was goin' to let us off?"</p>

<p>"Jumping at conclusions hastily is a habit to be deplored,"
said Angel sententiously. Then he saw the panic-stricken Mr.
Lane.</p>

<p>"Hullo, what's this?" he demanded. Mr. Lane had at that
moment the inspiration of his life. Since he was by fortuitous
circumstances involved in this matter, and since it could make
very little difference one way or the other what he said, he
seized the fame that lay to his hand. "I am one of the 'Borough
Lot,'" he said, and was led out proud and handcuffed with the
knowledge that he had established beyond dispute his title to
consideration as a desperate criminal.</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding was a man who thought quickly. Ideas and plans
came to him as dross and diamonds come to the man at the sorting
table, and he had the faculty of selection. He saw the police
system of England as only the police themselves saw it, and he
had an open mind upon Angel's action. It was within the bounds
of possibility that Angel had acted with full authority; it was
equally possible that Angel was bluffing. Mr. Spedding had two
courses before him, and they were both desperate; but he must be
sure in how, so far, his immediate liberty depended upon the
whim of a deputy-assistant-commissioner of police. Angel had
mentioned a supreme authority. It was characteristic of Spedding
that he should walk into a mine to see how far the fuse had
burned. In other words, he hailed the first cab, and drove to
the House of Commons. The Right Honorable George Chandler
Middleborough, His Majesty's Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, is a notoriously inaccessible man; but he makes
exceptions, and such an exception he made in favour of Spedding.
For eminent solicitors do not come down to the House at ten
o'clock in the evening to gratify an idle curiosity, or to be
shown over the House, or beg patronage and interest; and when a
business card is marked "most urgent," and that card stands for
a staple representative of an important profession, the request
for an interview is not easily refused.</p>

<p>Spedding was shown into the minister's room, and the Home
Secretary rose with a smile. He knew Mr. Spedding by sight, and
had once dined in his company, "Er&mdash;" he began, looking at
the card in his hand, "what can I do for you at this hour?" he
smiled again.</p>

<p>"I have called to see you in the matter of the
late&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Reale." He saw and watched the
minister's face. Beyond looking a little puzzled, the Home
Secretary made no sign.</p>

<p>"Good!" thought Spedding, and breathed with more freedom.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;" said the minister.</p>

<p>He got no further, for Spedding was at once humility,
apology, and embarrassment. What! had the Home Secretary not
received his letter? A letter dealing with the estate of Reale?
You can imagine the distress and vexation on Mr. Spedding's face
as he spoke of the criminal carelessness of his clerk, his
attitude of helplessness, his recognition of the absolute
impossibility of discussing the matter until the Secretary had
received the letter, and his withdrawal, leaving behind him a
sympathetic minister of State who would have been
pleased&mdash;would have been delighted, my dear sir, to have
helped Mr. Spedding if he'd received the letter in time to
consider its contents.</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding was an inventive genius, and it might have been
in reference to him that the motherhood of invention was first
identified with dire necessity.</p>

<p>Out again in the courtyard, Spedding found a cab that carried
him to his club.</p>

<p>"Angel bluffed!" he reflected with an inward smile. "My
friend, you are risking that nice appointment of yours." He
smiled again, for it occurred to him that his risk was the
greater. "Two millions!" he murmured. "It is worth it: I could
do a great deal with two millions." He got down at his club, and
tendered the cab-man the legal fare to a penny.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE QUEST OF THE
BOOK</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Piccadilly Circus, a blaze of light, was
thronged with the crowds that the theatres were discharging, a
motor-car came gingerly through the traffic, passed down Regent
Street, and swinging along Pall Mall, headed southward across
Westminster Bridge. The rain had ceased, but underfoot the roads
were sodden, and the car bespattered its occupants with black
mud. The chauffeur at the wheel turned as the car ran smoothly
along the tramway lines in the Old Kent Road and asked a
question, and one of the two men in the back of the car
consulted the other.</p>

<p>"We will go to Cramer's first," said the man. Old Kent Road
was a fleeting vision of closed shops, of little knots of men
emerging from public-houses at the potman's strident command;
Lewisham High Road, as befits that very respectable
thoroughfare, was decorously sleeping; Lea, where the hedges
begin, was silent; and Chislehurst was a place of the dead. Near
the common the car pulled up at a big house standing in black
quietude, and the two occupants of the car descended and passed
through the stiff gate, along the gravelled path, and came to a
stop at the broad porch.</p>

<p>"I don't know what old Mauder will say," said Angel as he
fumbled for the bell; "he's a methodical old chap." In the
silence they could hear the thrill of the electric bell. They
waited a few minutes, and rang again. Then they heard a window
opened and a sleepy voice demand&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>Angel stepped back from the porch and looked up. "Hullo,
Mauder! I want you. I'm Angel."</p>

<p>"The devil!" said a surprised voice. "Wait a bit. I'll be
down in a jiffy."</p>

<p>The pleasant-faced man who in dressing-gown and pajamas
opened the door to them and conducted them to a cosy library was
Mr. Ernest Mauder himself.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to introduce that world-famous publisher to
the reader, the more particularly in view of the storm of
controversy that burst about his robust figure in regard to the
recent publication of Count Lehoff''s embarrassing "Memoirs." He
made a sign to the two men to be seated, nodding to Jimmy as to
an old friend.</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry to disturb you at this rotten hour,"
Angel commenced, and the other arrested his apology with a
gesture.</p>

<p>"You detective people are so fond of springing surprises on
us unintelligent outsiders," he said, with a twinkle in his eye,
"that I am almost tempted to startle you."</p>

<p>"It takes a lot to startle me," said Angel complacently.</p>

<p>"You've brought it on your own head," warned the publisher,
wagging a forefinger at the smiling Angel. "Now let me tell you
why you have motored down from London on this miserable night on
a fairly fruitless errand."</p>

<p>"Eh?" The smile left Angel's face.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought that would startle you! You've come about a
book?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmy wonderingly.</p>

<p>"A book published by our people nine years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the wonderment deepening on the faces of the two
men.</p>

<p>"The title," said the publisher impressively, "is A Short
Study on the Origin of the Alphabet, and the author is a half-mad
old don, who was subsequently turned out of Oxford for
drunkenness."</p>

<p>"Mauder," said Jimmy, gazing at his host in bewilderment,
"you've hit it&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the publisher, triumphant, "I thought that was it.
Well, your search is fruitless. We only printed five hundred
copies; the book was a failure&mdash;the same ground was more
effectively covered by better books. I found a dusty old copy a
few years ago, and gave it to my secretary. So far as I know,
that is the only copy in existence."</p>

<p>"But your secretary?" said Angel eagerly. "What is his name?
Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"It's not a 'he,'" said Mauder, "but a 'she.'"</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"If you had asked that question earlier in the evening I
could not have told you," said Mauder, obviously enjoying the
mystery he had created, "but since then my memory has been
refreshed. The girl&mdash;and a most charming lady too&mdash;was
my secretary for two years. I do not know what induced her to
work, but I rather think she supported an invalid father."</p>

<p>"What is her name?" asked Angel impatiently.</p>

<p>"Kathleen Kent," replied the publisher, "and her address
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kathleen Kent!" repeated Jimmy in wide-eyed astonishment.
"Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us!"</p>

<p>"Kathleen Kent!" repeated Angel with a gasp. "Well, that
takes the everlasting biscuit! But," he added quickly, "how did
you come to know of our errand?"</p>

<p>"Well," drawled the elder man, wrapping his dressing-gown
round him more snugly, "it was a guess to an extent. You see,
Angel, when a man has been already awakened out of a sound sleep
to answer mysterious inquiries about an out-of-date
book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What," cried Jimmy, jumping up, "somebody has already been
here?"</p>

<p>"It is only natural," the publisher went on, "to connect his
errand with that of the second midnight intruder."</p>

<p>"Who has been here? For Heaven's sake, don't be funny; this
is a serious business."</p>

<p>"Nobody has been here," said Mauder, "but an hour ago a man
called me up on the telephone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at Angel, and Angel looked at Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," said Angel penitently, "write me down as a fool.
Telephone! Heavens, I didn't know you were connected."</p>

<p>"Nor was I till last week," said the publisher, "nor will I
be after tomorrow. Sleep is too precious a gift to be
dissipated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who was the man?" demanded Angel.</p>

<p>"I couldn't quite catch his name. He was very apologetic. I
gathered that he was a newspaper man, and wanted particulars in
connection with the death of the author."</p>

<p>Angel smiled. "The author's alive all right," he said grimly.
"How did the voice sound&mdash;a little pompous, with a clearing
of the throat before each sentence?"</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Spedding!" said Angel, rising. "We haven't any time to lose,
Jimmy."</p>

<p>Mander accompanied them into the hall.</p>

<p>"One question," said Jimmy, as he fastened the collar of his
motor-coat. "Can you give us if any idea of the contents of the
book?"</p>

<p>"I can't," was the reply. "I have a dim recollection that
much of it was purely conventional, that there were some rough
drawings, and the earlier forms of the alphabet were
illustrated&mdash;the sort of thing you find in encyclopaedias
or in the back pages of teachers' Bibles."</p>

<p>The two men took their seats in the car as it swung round and
turned its bright head-lamps toward London.</p>

<p><i>"I found this puzzle in a book From which some mighty truths
were took,"</i> murmured Angel in his companion's ear, and Jimmy
nodded. He was at that moment utterly oblivious and careless of
the fortune that awaited them in the great safe at Lombard
Street. His mind was filled with anxiety concerning the girl who
unconsciously held the book which might tomorrow make her an
heiress. Spedding had moved promptly, and he would be aided, he
did not doubt, by Connor and the ruffians of the "Borough Lot."
If the book was still in the girl's possession they would have
it, and they would make their attempt at once. His mind was full
of dark forebodings, and although the car bounded through the
night at full speed, and the rain which had commenced to fall
again cut his face, and the momentum of the powerful machine
took his breath away, it went all too slowly for his mood.</p>

<p>One incident relieved the monotony of the journey. As the car
flew round a corner in an exceptionally narrow lane it almost
crashed into another car, which, driven at breakneck speed, was
coming in the opposite direction. A fleeting exchange of curses
between the chauffeurs, and the cars passed. By common consent,
they had headed for Kathleen's home. Streatham was deserted.</p>

<p>As they turned the corner of the quiet road in which the girl
lived, Angel stopped the car and alighted. He lifted one of the
huge lamps from the socket and examined the road.</p>

<p>"There has been a car here less than half an hour ago," he
said, pointing to the unmistakable track of wheels. They led to
the door of the house. He rang the bell, and it was almost
immediately answered by an elderly lady, who, wrapped in a loose
dressing-gown, bade him enter.</p>

<p>"Nobody seems to be surprised to see us tonight," thought
Angel with bitter humour.</p>

<p>"I am Detective Angel from Scotland Yard," he announced
himself, and the elderly lady seemed unimpressed.</p>

<p>"Kathleen has gone," she informed him cheerfully.</p>

<p>Jimmy heard her with a sinking at his heart.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old lady, "Mr. Spedding, the eminent
solicitor, called for her an hour ago, and"&mdash;she grew
confidential&mdash;"as I know you gentlemen are very much
interested in the case, I may say that there is every hope that
before tomorrow my niece will be in possession of her
fortune."</p>

<p>Jimmy groaned. "Please, go on," said Angel.</p>

<p>"It came about over a book which Kathleen had given her some
years ago, and which most assuredly would have been lost but for
my carefulness."</p>

<p>Jimmy cursed her "carefulness" under his breath.</p>

<p>"When we moved here after the death of Kathleen's poor father
I had a great number of things stored. There were amongst these
an immense quantity of books, which Kathleen would have sold,
but which I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where are these stored?" asked Angel quickly.</p>

<p>"At an old property of ours&mdash;the only property that my
poor brother had remaining," she replied sadly, "and that
because it was in too dilapidated a condition to attract
buyers."</p>

<p>"Where, where?" Angel realized the rudeness of his
impatience. "Forgive me, madam," he said, "but it is absolutely
necessary that I should follow your niece at once."</p>

<p>"It is on the Tonbridge Road," she answered stiffly. "So far
as I can remember, it is somewhere between Crawley and
Tonbridge, but I am not sure. Kathleen knows the place well;
that is why she has gone."</p>

<p>"Somewhere on the Tonbridge Road!" repeated Angel
helplessly.</p>

<p>"We could follow the car's tracks," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "If this rain is general, they will be
obliterated," he replied.</p>

<p>They stood a minute, Jimmy biting the sodden finger of his
glove, and Angel staring into vacancy.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy demanded unexpectedly&mdash;"Have you a
Bible?"</p>

<p>The old lady allowed the astonishment she felt at the
question to be apparent. "I have several."</p>

<p>"A teacher's Bible, with notes?" he asked.</p>

<p>She thought. "Yes, there is such an one in the house. Will
you wait?"</p>

<p>She left the room.</p>

<p>"We should have told the girl about Spedding&mdash;we should
have told her," said Angel in despair.</p>

<p>"It's no use crying over spilt milk," said Jimmy quietly.
"The thing to do now is to frustrate Spedding and rescue the
girl."</p>

<p>"Will he dare&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"He'll dare. Oh, yes, he'll dare," said Jimmy. "He's worse
than you think, Angel."</p>

<p>"But he is already a ruined man."</p>

<p>"The more reason why he should go a step further. He's been
on the verge of ruin for months, I've found that out. I made
inquiries the other day, and discovered he's in a hole that the
dome of St. Paul's wouldn't fill. He's a trustee or something of
the sort for an association that has been pressing him for
money. Spedding will dare anything "&mdash;he paused
then&mdash;"but if he dares to harm that girl he's a dead
man."</p>

<p>The old lady came in at that moment with the book, and Jimmy
hastily turned over the pages. Near the end he came upon
something that brought a gleam to his eye. He thrust his hand
into his pocket and drew out a notebook. He did not wait to pull
up a chair, but sank on his knees by the side of the table and
wrote rapidly, comparing the text with the drawings in the
book.</p>

<p>Angel, leaning over, followed the work breathlessly.
"There&mdash;and there&mdash;and there!" cried Angel exultantly.
"What fools we were, Jimmy, what fools we were."</p>

<p>Jimmy turned to the lady. "May I borrow this book?" he asked.
"It will be returned. Thank you. Now, Angel," he looked at his
watch and made a move for the door, "we have two hours. We will
take the Tonbridge Road by daybreak."</p>

<p>Only one other person did they disturb on that eventful
night, and that was a peppery old Colonel of Marines, who lived
at Blackheath. There, before the hastily-attired old officer, as
the dawn broke, Angel explained his mission, and writing with
feverish haste, subscribed to the written statement by oath.
Whereupon the Justice of the Peace issued a warrant for the
arrest of Joseph James Spedding, Solicitor, on a charge of
felony.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">XII. &mdash; WHAT HAPPENED AT
FLAIRBY MILL</a></h2>

<p class="first">KATHLEEN very naturally regarded the lawyer in
the light of a disinterested friend. There was no reason why she
should not do so; and if there had been any act needed to kindle
a kindly feeling for the distant legal adviser it was this last
act of his, for no sooner, as he told her, had he discovered by
the merest accident a clue to the hidden word, than he had
rushed off post-haste to put her in possession of his
information. He had naturally advised immediate action, and when
she demurred at the lateness of the hour at which to begin a
hunt for the book, he had hinted vaguely at difficulties which
would beset her if she delayed.</p>

<p>She wanted to let Angel know, and Jimmy, but this the lawyer
would not hear of, and she accounted for the insistence of his
objection by the cautiousness of the legal mind. Then the
excitement of the midnight adventure appealed to her&mdash;the
swift run in the motor-car through the wild night, and the
wonderful possibilities of the search at the end of the
ride.</p>

<p>So she went, and her appetite for adventure was all but
satisfied by a narrowly-averted collision with another car
speeding in the opposite direction. She did not see the
occupants of the other car, but she hoped they had had as great
a fright as she. As a matter of fact, neither of the two men had
given a second thought to their danger; one's mind was entirely
and completely filled with her image, and the other was brooding
on telephones.</p>

<p>She had no time to tire of the excitement of the
night&mdash;the run across soaking heaths and through dead
villages, where little cottages showed up for a moment in the
glare of the head-lights, then faded into the darkness. Too soon
she came to a familiar stretch of the road, and the car slowed
down so that they might not pass the tiny grass lane that led to
Flairby Mill. They came to it at last, and the car bumped
cautiously over deep cart ruts, over loose stones, and through
long drenched grasses till there loomed out of the night the
squat outlines of Flairby Mill.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, before the coming of cheap machinery,
Flairby Mill had been famous in the district, and the rumble of
its big stones went on incessantly, night and day; but the wheel
had long since broken, its wreck lay in the bed of the little
stream that had so faithfully served it; its machinery was rust
and scrap iron, and only the tiny dwelling-house that adjoined
was of value. With little or no repair the homestead had
remained watertight and weatherproof, and herein had Kathleen
stored the odds and ends of her father's household. The saddles,
shields, spears, and oddments he had collected in his travels,
and the modest library that had consoled the embittered years of
his passing, were all stored here. Valueless as the world
assesses value, but in the eyes of the girl precious things
associated with her dead father. The tears rose to her eyes as
Spedding, taking the key from her hand, fitted it into the lock
of a seventeenth-century door, but she wiped them away
furtively.</p>

<p>Spedding utilized the acetylene lamp of the car to show him
the way into the house.</p>

<p>"You must direct me, Miss Kent," he said, and Kathleen
pointed the way. Up the oaken stairs, covered with dust, their
footsteps resounding hollowly through the deserted homestead,
the two passed. At the head of the stairs was a heavy door, and
acting under the girl's instructions, the lawyer opened this. It
was a big room, almost like a barn, with a timbered ceiling
sloping downward. There were three shuttered windows, and
another door at the farther end of the room that led to a
smaller room.</p>

<p>"This was the miller's living room," she said sadly. She
could just remember when a miller lived in the homestead, and
when she had ridden up to the door of the mill accompanied by
her father, and the miller, white and jovial, had lifted her
down and taken her through a mysterious chamber where great
stones turned laboriously and noisily, and the air was filled
with a fine white dust.</p>

<p>Spedding placed the lamp on the table, and cast his eyes
round the room in search of the books. They were not difficult
to discover; they had been unpacked, and were ranged in three
disorderly rows upon roughly constructed bookshelves. The lawyer
turned the lamp so that the full volume of light should fall on
the books. Then he went carefully over them, row by row,
checking each copy methodically, and half muttering the name of
each tome he handled. There were school books, works of travel,
and now and again a heavily bound scientific treatise, for her
father had made science a particular study.</p>

<p>The girl stood with one hand resting on the table, looking
on, admiring the patience of the smooth, heavy man at his task,
and, it must be confessed, inwardly wondering what necessity
there was for this midnight visitation. She had told the lawyer
nothing about the red envelope, but instinctively felt that he
knew all about it.</p>

<p>"Anabasis, Xenophon," he muttered; "Iosephus, Works and Life;
Essays of Elia; Essays, Emerson; Essays, De Quincey. Wliat's
this?"</p>

<p>He drew from between two bulky volumes a thin little book
with a discoloured cover. He dusted it carefully, glanced at the
title, opened it and read the title-page, then walked back to
the table and seated himself, and started to read the book.</p>

<p>The girl did not know why, but there was something in his
attitude at that moment that caused her a little uneasiness, and
stirred within her a sense of danger. Perhaps it was that up
till then he had shown her marked deference, had been almost
obsequious. Now that the book had been found he disregarded her.
He did not bring it to her or invite her attention, and she felt
that she was "out of the picture," that the lawyer's interest in
her affairs had stopped dead just as soon as the discovery was
made. He turned the leaves over carefully, poring over the
introduction, and her eyes wandered from the book to his face.
She had never looked at him before with any critical interest.
In the unfriendly light of the lamp she saw his
imperfections&mdash;the brutal strength of his jaw, the
unscrupulous thinness of the lip, the heavy eyelids, and the
curious hairlessness of his face. She shivered a little, for she
read too much in his face for her peace of mind. Unconscious of
her scrutiny, for the book before him was all-engrossing, the
lawyer went from page to page.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better be going?" Kathleen asked
timidly.</p>

<p>Spedding looked up, and his stare was in keeping with his
words.</p>

<p>"When I have finished we will go," he said brusquely, and
went on reading.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a little gasp of astonishment, for, with all
her suspicions, she had not been prepared for such a complete
and instant dropping of his mask of amiability. In a dim fashion
she began to realize her danger, yet there could be no harm;
outside was the chauffeur, he stood for something of established
order. She made another attempt.</p>

<p>"I must insist, Mr. Spedding, upon your finishing your
examination of that book elsewhere. I do not know whether you
are aware that you are occupying the only chair in the room,"
she added indignantly.</p>

<p>"I am very well aware," said the lawyer calmly, without
raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Spedding!"</p>

<p>He looked up with an air of weariness. "May I ask you to
remain quiet until I have finished," he said, with an emphasis
that she could not mistake, "and lest you have any lingering
doubt that my present research is rather on my own account than
on yours, I might add that if you annoy me by whining or fuming,
or by any such nonsensical tricks, I have that with me which
will quiet you," and he resumed his reading.</p>

<p>Cold and white, the girl stood in silence, her heart beating
wildly, her mind occupied with schemes of escape. After a while
the lawyer looked up and tapped the book with his
forefinger.</p>

<p>"Your precious secret is a secret no longer," he said with a
hard laugh. Kathleen made no answer. "If I hadn't been a fool, I
should have seen through it before," he added, then he looked at
the girl in meditation. "I have two propositions before me," he
said, "and I want your help."</p>

<p>"You will have no help from me, Mr. Spedding," she replied
coldly.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you will be asked to explain your extraordinary
conduct."</p>

<p>He laughed. "Tomorrow, by whom? By Angel or the young
swell-mobsman who's half in love with you?" He laughed again as he
saw the colour rising to the girl's cheeks. "Ah! I've hit the mark,
have I?"</p>

<p>She received his speech in contemptuous silence.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow I shall be away&mdash;well away, I trust, from the
reach of either of the gentlemen you mention. I am not concerned
with tomorrow as much as today." She remembered that they were
within an hour of daybreak.</p>

<p>"Today is a most fateful day for me&mdash;and for you." He
emphasized the last words. She preserved an icy silence.</p>

<p>"If I may put my case in a nutshell," he went on, with all
his old-time suavity, "I may say that it is necessary for me to
secure the money that is stored in that ridiculous safe." She
checked an exclamation. "Ah! you understand? Let me be more
explicit. When I say get the money, I mean get it for myself,
every penny of it, and convert it to my private use. You can
have no idea," he went on, "how comforting it is to be able to
stand up and say in so many words the unspoken thoughts of a
year, to tell some human being the most secret things that I
have so far hidden here," he struck his chest. "I had thought
when old Reale's commission was entrusted to me that I should
find the legatees ordinary plain, everyday fools, who would have
unfolded to me day by day the result of their investigations to
my profit. I did not reckon very greatly on you, for women are
naturally secretive and suspicious, but I did rely upon the two
criminals. My experience of the criminal classes, a fairly
extensive one, led me to believe that with these gentry I should
have no difficulty." He pursed his lips. "I had calculated
without my Jimmy," he said shortly. He saw the light in the
girl's eye. "Yes," he went on, "Jimmy is no ordinary man, and
Angel is a glaring instance of bad nomenclature. I nearly had
Jimmy once. Did he tell you how he got the red envelope? I see
he did not. Well, I nearly had him. I went to look for his body
next morning, and found nothing. Later in the day I received a
picture postcard from him, of a particularly flippant and vulgar
character?" He stopped as if inviting comment.</p>

<p>"Your confessions have little interest for me," said the girl
quietly. "I am now only anxious to be rid of your presence."</p>

<p>"I am coming to that," said the lawyer. "I was very rude to
you a little while ago, but I was busily engaged, and besides I
desired to give you an artistic introduction to the new
condition. Now, so far from being rude, I wish to be very
kind."</p>

<p>In spite of her outward calm, she trembled at the silky tone
the lawyer had now adopted.</p>

<p>"My position is this," he said, "there is an enormous sum of
money, which rightly is yours. The law and the inclination of
your competitor&mdash;we will exclude Connor, who is not a
factor&mdash;give you the money. It is unfortunate that I also,
who have no earthly right, should desire this money, and we have
narrowed down the ultimate issue to this: Shall it be Spedding
or Kathleen Kent? I say Spedding, and circumstances support my
claim, for I have you here, and, if you will pardon the
suspicion of melodrama, very much in my power. If I am to take
the two millions, your two millions, without interruption, it
will depend entirely upon you."</p>

<p>Again he stopped to notice the effect of his words.</p>

<p>The girl made no response, but he could see the terror in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"If I could have dispensed with your services, or if I had
had the sense to guess the simple solution of this cursed
puzzle, I could have done everything without embarrassing you in
the slightest; but now it has come to this&mdash;I have got to
silence you."</p>

<p>He put forward the proposition with the utmost coolness, and
Kathleen felt her senses reel at all the words implied.</p>

<p>"I can silence you by killing you," he said simply, "or by
marrying you. If I could think of some effective plan by which I
might be sure of your absolute obliteration for two days, I
would gladly adopt it; but you are a human woman, and that is
too much to expect. Now, of the alternatives, which do you
prefer?"</p>

<p>She shrank back against the shuttered window, her eyes on the
man.</p>

<p>"You are doubtless thinking of the chauffeur," he said
smoothly, "but you may leave him out of the reckoning. Had your
ears been sharp, you would have heard the car going back half an
hour ago&mdash;he is awaiting our return half a mile away. If I
return alone he will doubtlessly be surprised, but he will know
nothing. Do you not see a picture of him driving me away, and
me, at his side, turning round and waving a smiling farewell to
an imaginary woman who is invisible to the chauffeur? Picture
his uneasiness vanishing with this touch. Two days afterwards he
would be on the sea with me, ignorant of the murder, and curious
things happen at sea. Come, Kathleen, is it to be
marriage&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Death!" she cried hoarsely, then, as his swift hand caught
her by the throat, she screamed. His face looked down into hers,
no muscle of it moved. Fixed, rigid, and full of his dreadful
purpose, she saw the pupils of his pitiless eyes contract Then
of a sudden he released hold of her, and she fell back against
the wall. She heard his quick breathing, and closing her eyes,
waited. Then slowly she looked up. She saw a revolver in his
hand, and in a numb kind of way she realized that it was not
pointed at her.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" She heard Spedding's harsh shout. "Hands up, both
of you!"</p>

<p>Then she heard an insolent laugh. There were only two men in
the world who would laugh like that in the very face of death,
and they were both there, standing in the doorway, Angel with
his motor goggles about his neck and Jimmy slowly peeling his
gloves.</p>

<p>Then she looked at Spedding. The hand that held the revolver
did not tremble, he was as self-possessed as he had been a few
minutes before.</p>

<p>"If either of you move I'll shoot the girl, by God!" said
Spedding through his teeth.</p>

<p>They stood in the doorway, and Jimmy spoke. He did not raise
his voice, but she heard the slumbering passion vibrating
through his quiet sentences.</p>

<p>"Spedding, Spedding, my man, you're frightening that child;
put your gun down and let us talk. Do you hear me? I am keeping
myself in hand, Spedding, but if you harm that girl I'll be a
devil to you. D'ye hear? If you hurt her, I'll take you with my
bare hands and treat you Indian fashion, Spedding, my man, tie
you down and stake you out, then burn you slowly. Yes, and, by
the Lord, if any man interferes, even if it's Angel here, I'll
swing for him. D'ye hear that?"</p>

<p>His breast heaved with the effort to hold himself, and
Spedding, shuddering at the ferocity in the man's whole bearing,
lowered his pistol.</p>

<p>"Let us talk," he said huskily.</p>

<p>"That's better," said Angel, "and let me talk first. I want
you."</p>

<p>"Come and take me," he said.</p>

<p>"The risk is too great," said Angel frankly, "and besides, I
can afford to wait."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the lawyer defiantly, after a long pause. He
kept the weapon in his hand pointed in the vicinity of the girl.
Angel exchanged a word in an undertone with his companion,
then&mdash;"You may go," he said, and stepped aside.</p>

<p>Spedding motioned him farther away. Then slowly edging his
way to the door, he reached it. He paused for a moment as if
about to speak, then quick as thought raised his revolver and
fired twice. Angel felt the wind of the bullets as they passed
his face, and sprang forward just as Jimmy's arm shot out.
Crack, crack, crack! Three shots so rapid that their reports
were almost simultaneous from Jimmy's automatic pistol sped
after the lawyer, but too late, and the heavy door crashed to in
Angel's face, and the snap of the lock told them they were
prisoners.</p>

<p>Angel made a dart for a window, but it was shuttered and
nailed and immovable. He looked at Jimmy, and burst into a
ringing laugh. "Trapped, by Jove!" he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy was on his knees by the side of the girl. She had not
fainted, but had suddenly realized her terrible danger, and the
strain and weariness of the night adventure had brought her
trembling to her knees. Very tenderly did Jimmy's arm support
her. She felt the strength of the man, and, thrilled at his
touch, her head sank on his shoulder and she felt at rest.</p>

<p>Angel was busily examining the windows, when a loud report
outside the house arrested his attention. "What is that?" asked
the girl faintly.</p>

<p>"It is either Mr. Spedding's well-timed suicide, which I fear
is too much to expect," said Angel philosophically, "or else it
is the same Mr. Spedding destroying the working parts of our
car. I am afraid it is the latter."</p>

<p>He moved up and down the room, examined the smaller chamber
at the other end, then sniffed uneasily.</p>

<p>"Miss Kent," he said earnestly, "are you well enough to tell
me something?"</p>

<p>She started and flushed as she drew herself from Jimmy's
arms, and stood up a little shakily. "Yes," she said, with a
faint smile, "I think I am all right now."</p>

<p>"What is there under here?" asked Angel, pointing to the
floor.</p>

<p>"An old workshop, a sort of storehouse," she replied in
surprise.</p>

<p>"What is in it?" There was no mistaking the seriousness in
Angel's voice. "Broken furniture? Mattresses?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think there are, and paints and things. Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy," said Angel quickly, "do you smell anything?"</p>

<p>Jimmy sniffed. "Yes," he said quickly. "Quick, the
windows!"</p>

<p>They made a rapid search of the room. In a corner Jimmy
unearthed a rusty cavalry sabre.</p>

<p>"That's the thing," said Angel, and started to prise loose
the solid shutter; but the wood was unyielding, and just as they
had secured a purchase the blade snapped.</p>

<p>"There is an old axe in the cupboard," cried the girl, who
apprehended the hidden danger.</p>

<p>With a yell of joy Angel dragged forth an antiquated
battle-axe, and attacked the shutter afresh. With each blow the wood
flew in big splinters, but fast as he worked something else was
moving faster. Angel had not mistaken the smell of petrol, and
now a thin vapour of smoke flowed into the room from underneath
the door, and in tiny spirals through the interstices of the
floorboards.</p>

<p>Angel stopped exhausted, and Jimmy picked up the axe and
struck it true, then after one vigorous stroke a streak of
daylight showed in the shutter. The room was now intolerably
hot, and Angel took up the axe and hacked away at the oaken
barrier to life.</p>

<p>"Shall we escape?" asked the girl quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Jimmy steadily.</p>

<p>"I shall not regret tonight," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Jimmy in a low voice, "whatever the issue is.
It is very good to love once in a lifetime, even if that once is
on the brink of the grave."</p>

<p>Her lips quivered, and she tried to speak. Angel was hard at
work on the window, and his back was toward them, and Jimmy bent
and kissed the girl on the lips.</p>

<p>The window was down! Angel turned in a welter of perspiring
triumph.</p>

<p>"Outside as quick as dammit!" he cried. Angel had found a
rope in the smaller room in his earlier search, and this he
slipped round the girl's waist.</p>

<p>"When you get down run clear of the smoke," he instructed
her, and in a minute she found herself swinging in mid-air, in a
cloud of rolling smoke that blinded and choked her. She felt the
ground, and staying only to loose the rope, she ran outward and
fell exhausted on a grassy bank. In a few minutes the two men
were by her side. They stood in silence contemplating the
conflagration, then Kathleen remembered.</p>

<p>"The book, the book!" she cried.</p>

<p>"It's inside my shirt," said the shameless Angel.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; CONNOR TAKES A
HAND</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT is an axiom at Scotland Yard, "Beware of an
audience." Enemies of our police system advance many and curious
reasons for this bashfulness. In particular they place a
sinister interpretation upon the desire of the police to carry
out their work without fuss and without ostentation, for the
police have an embarrassing system of midnight arrests. Unless
you advertise the fact, or unless your case is of sufficient
importance to merit notice in the evening newspapers, there is
no reason why your disappearance from society should excite
comment, or why the excuse, put forward for your absence from
your accustomed haunts, that you have gone abroad should not be
accepted without question.</p>

<p>Interviewing his wise chief, Angel received some excellent
advice.</p>

<p>"If you've got to arrest him, do it quietly. If, as you
suggest, he barricades himself in his house, or takes refuge in
his patent vault, leave him alone. We want no fuss, and we want
no newspaper sensations. If you can square up the Reale business
without arresting him, by all means do so. We shall probably get
him in&mdash;er&mdash;what do you call it, Angel?&mdash;oh, yes,
'the ordinary way of business.'"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Angel, nothing loth to carry out the
plan.</p>

<p>"From what I know of this class of man," the
Assistant-Commissioner went on, fingering his grizzled
moustache, "he will do nothing. He will go about his daily life
as though nothing had happened; you will find him in his office
this morning, and if you went to arrest him you'd be shot dead.
No, if you take my advice you'll leave him severely alone for
the present. He won't run away."</p>

<p>So Angel thanked his chief and departed. Throughout the
morning he was obsessed by a desire to see the lawyer. By midday
this had become so overmastering that he put on his hat and
sauntered down to Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Spedding was in," said a sober clerk,
and&mdash;after consulting his employer&mdash;"Mr. Spedding
would see him."</p>

<p>The lawyer was sitting behind a big desk covered with
beribboned bundles of papers. He greeted Angel with a smile, and
pointed to a chair on the other side of the desk.</p>

<p>"I've been in court most of the morning," he said blandly,
"but I'm at liberty for half an hour. What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>Angel looked at him in undisguised admiration. "You're a
wonderful chap," he said with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"You're admiring me," said the lawyer, fingering a
paperknife, "in very much the same way as an enthusiastic
naturalist admires the markings of a horned viper."</p>

<p>"That is very nicely put," said Angel truthfully.</p>

<p>The lawyer had dropped his eyes on to the desk before him;
then he looked up. "What is it to be?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A truce," said Angel.</p>

<p>"I thought you would say that," replied Spedding comfortably,
"because I suppose you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Angel with nonchalant ease, "I know that the
right hand which is so carelessly reposing on your knee holds a
weapon of remarkable precision."</p>

<p>"You are well advised," said the lawyer, with a slight
bow.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Angel, "there is a warrant in existence for
your arrest."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Spedding politely.</p>

<p>"I got it as a precautionary measure," Angel went on in his
most affable manner.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the lawyer; "and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, now," said Angel, "I wanted to give you formal notice
that, on behalf of Miss Kent, we intend opening the safe
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I will be there," said the lawyer, and rang a bell.</p>

<p>"And," added Angel in a lower voice, "keep out of Jimmy's
way."</p>

<p>Spedding's lips twitched, the only sign of nervousness he had
shown during the interview, but he made no reply. As the clerk
stood waiting at the open door, Spedding, with his most gracious
smile, said&mdash;"Er&mdash;and did you get home safely this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you," replied Angel, in no wise perturbed by
the man's audacity.</p>

<p>"Did you find your country
quarters&mdash;er&mdash;comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Angel, rising to the occasion, "but the
function was a failure."</p>

<p>"The function?" The lawyer bit at the bait Angel had
thrown.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the detective, his hand on the door, "the
house-warming, you know."</p>

<p>Angel chuckled to himself all the way back to the Embankment.
His grim little jest pleased him so much that he must needs call
in and tell his chief, and the chief's smile was very
flattering.</p>

<p>"You're a bright boy," he said, "but when the day comes for
you to arrest that lawyer gentleman, I trust you will, as a
precautionary measure, purge your soul of all frivolities, and
prepare yourself for a better world."</p>

<p>"If," said Angel, "I do not see the humorous side of being
killed, I shall regard my life as badly ended."</p>

<p>"Get out," ordered the Commissioner, and Angel got.</p>

<p>He realized as the afternoon wore on that he was very tired,
and snatched a couple of hours' sleep before keeping the
appointment he had made with Jimmy earlier in the day. Whilst he
was dressing Jimmy came in&mdash;Jimmy rather white, with a
surgical bandage round his head, and carrying with him the
pungent scent of iodoform.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said Angel in astonishment, "what on earth have you
been doing?"</p>

<p>Jimmy cast an eye round the room in search of the most
luxurious chair before replying.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said with a sigh of contentment as he seated
himself, "that's better."</p>

<p>Angel pointed to the bandage. "When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"An hour or so ago," said Jimmy. "Spedding is a most active
man."</p>

<p>Angel whistled. "Conventionally?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Artistically," responded Jimmy, nodding his bandaged head.
"A runaway motor-car that followed my cab&mdash;beautifully
done. The cab-horse was killed and the driver has a concussion,
but I saw the wheeze and jumped."</p>

<p>"Got the chauffeur?" asked Angel anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was in the City. You know the City police? Well,
they had him in three seconds. He tried to bolt, but that's a
fool's game in the City."</p>

<p>"Was it Spedding's chauffeur?"</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled pityingly. "Of course not. That's where the art
of the thing comes in."</p>

<p>Angel looked grave for a minute. "I think we ought to 'pull'
our friend," he said.</p>

<p>"Meaning Spedding?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you," said Jimmy. "It would be ever so
much more comfortable for you and me, but it will be ever so
much better to finish up the Reale business first."</p>

<p>"Great minds!" murmured Angel, remembering his chief's
advice. "I suppose Mr. Spedding will lay for me tonight."</p>

<p>"You can bet your life on that," said Jimmy cheerfully.</p>

<p>As he was speaking, a servant came into the room with a
letter. When the man had gone, Angel opened and read it. His
grin grew broader as he perused it.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said. "It's from Miss Kent."</p>

<p>Jimmy was all attention.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Angel, Spedding has trapped me again. Whilst I was
shopping this afternoon, two men came up to me and asked me to
accompany them. They said they were police officers, and wanted
me in connection with last night's affair. I was so worried that
I went with them. They took me to a strange house in
Kensington... For Heaven's sake, come to me!..."</p>

<p>Jimmy's face was so white that Angel thought he would
faint.</p>

<p>"The hounds!" he cried. "Angel, we must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must sit down," said Angel, "or you'll be having a
fit."</p>

<p>He examined the letter again. "It's beautifully done," he
said. "Scrawled on a torn draper's bill in pencil, it might very
easily be her writing."</p>

<p>He put the missive carefully in a drawer of his desk, and
locked it.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for the success of that scheme, Mr. Spedding,
I have four men watching Miss Kent's house day and night, and
being in telephonic communication, I happen to know that that
young lady has not left her house all day." He looked at Jimmy,
white and shaking. "Buck up, Jimmy," he said kindly. "Your bang
on the head has upset you more than you think."</p>

<p>"But the letter?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"A little fake," said Angel airily, "Mr. Spedding's little
ballon d'essai, so foolishly simple that I think Spedding must
be losing his nerve and balance. I'd like to bet that this house
is being watched to see the effect of the note." (Angel would
have won his bet.) "Now the only question is, what little
program have they arranged for me this evening?"</p>

<p>Jimmy was thoughtful. "I don't know," he said slowly, "but I
should think it would be wiser for you to keep indoors. You
might make me up a bed in your sitting-room, and if there is any
bother, we can share it."</p>

<p>"And whistle to keep my courage up?" sneered Angel. "I'll
make you up a bed with all the pleasure in life; but I'm going
out, Jimmy, and I'll take you with me, if you'll agree to come
along and find a man who will replace that conspicuous white
bandage by something less bloodcurdling."</p>

<p>They found a man in Devonshire Place who was a mutual friend
of both. He was a specialist in unpronounceable diseases, a
Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George, a Fellow of the
two Colleges, and the author of half a dozen works of medical
science. Angel addressed him as "Bill."</p>

<p>The great surgeon deftly dressed the damaged head of Jimmy,
and wisely asked no questions. He knew them both, and had been
at Oxford with one, and he permitted himself to indulge in
caustic comments on their mode of life and the possibilities of
their end.</p>

<p>"If you didn't jaw so much," said Angel, "I'd employ you
regularly; as it is, I am very doubtful if I shall ever bring
you another case."</p>

<p>"For which," said Sir William Farran, as he clipped the loose
ends of the dressing, "I am greatly obliged to you, Angel
Esquire. You are the sort of patient I like to see about once a
year&mdash;just about Christmas-time, when I am surfeited with
charity toward mankind, when I need a healthy moral corrective
to tone down the bright picture to its normal
grayness&mdash;that's the time you're welcome, Angel."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Angel ecstatically. "I'd like to see that
sentence in a book, with illustrations."</p>

<p>The surgeon smiled good-humouredly. He put a final touch to
the dressing.</p>

<p>"There you are," he said. "Thank you, Bill," said Jimmy.
"You're getting fat."</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing," said the surgeon indignantly.</p>

<p>Angel struck a more serious tone when he asked the surgeon in
an undertone, just as they were taking their departure. "Where
will you be tonight?"</p>

<p>The surgeon consulted a little engagement book. "I am dining
at the 'Ritz' with some people at eight. We are going on to the
Gaiety afterwards, and I shall be home by twelve. Why?"</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman," said Angel confidentially, "who will
make a valiant attempt to kill one of us, or both of us tonight,
and he might just fail; so it would be as well to know where you
are, if you are wanted. Mind you," added Angel with a grin, "you
might be wanted for him."</p>

<p>"You're a queer bird," said the surgeon, "and Jimmy's a
queerer one. Well, off you go, you two fellows; you'll be
getting my house a bad name."</p>

<p>Outside in the street the two ingrates continued their
discussion on the corpulence that attends success in life. They
walked leisurely to Piccadilly, and turned towards the circus.
It is interesting to record the fact that for no apparent reason
they struck off into side streets, made unexpected excursions
into adjoining squares, took unnecessary short cuts through
mews, and finally, finding themselves at the Oxford Street end
of Charing Cross Road, they hailed a hansom, and drove eastward
rapidly.</p>

<p>Angel shouted up some directions through the trap in the
roof.</p>

<p>"I am moved to give the two gentlemen who are following me
what in sporting parlance is called 'a run for their money,'" he
said. He lifted the flap at the back of the cab, glanced through
the little window, and groaned. Then he gave fresh directions to
the cabman.</p>

<p>"Drive to the 'Troc,'" he called, and to Jimmy he added, "If
we must die, let us die full of good food."</p>

<p>In the thronged grill-room of the brightly-lighted restaurant
the two men found a table so placed that it commanded a view of
the room. They took their seats, and whilst Jimmy ordered the
dinner Angel watched the stream of people entering. He saw a
dapper little man, with swarthy face and coal-black eyes,
eyebrows and moustache, come through the glass doors. He stood
for a breathing space at the door, his bright eyes flashing from
face to face. Then he caught Angel's steady gaze, and his eyes
rested a little longer on the pair. Then Angel beckoned him. He
hesitated for a second, then walked slowly toward them. Jimmy
pulled a chair from the table, and again he hesitated as if in
doubt; then slowly he seated himself, glancing from one to the
other suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Callvet, ne c'est-ce pas?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"That is my name," the other answered in French.</p>

<p>"Permit me to introduce myself,"</p>

<p>"I know you," said the little man shortly. "You are a
detective."</p>

<p>"It is my fortune," said Angel, ignoring the bitterness in
the man's tone.</p>

<p>"You wish to speak to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Angel. "First, I would ask why you have been
following us for the last hour?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "Monsieur is mistaken."</p>

<p>Jimmy had been very quiet during the evening. Now he
addressed the Frenchman. "Callvet," he said briefly, "do you
know who I am?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are also a detective."</p>

<p>Jimmy looked him straight in the eyes. "I am not a detective,
Callvet, as you well know. I am"&mdash;he felt an unusual
repugnance at using the next words&mdash;"I am Jimmy of Cairo.
You know me?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," said the man doggedly.</p>

<p>"What you are&mdash;now&mdash;I do not know," said Jimmy
contemptuously. "I have known you as all things&mdash;as an
ornament of the young Egypt party, as a tout for Reale, as a
trader in beastliness."</p>

<p>The conversation was in colloquial French, and Jimmy used a
phrase which is calculated to raise the hair of the most brazen
scoundrel. But this man shrugged his shoulders and rose to go.
Jimmy caught his sleeve and detained him.</p>

<p>"Callvet," he said, "go back to Mr. Spedding, your employer,
and tell him the job is too dangerous. Tell him that one of the
men, at least, knows enough about you to send you to New
Caledonia, or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or else?" demanded the man defiantly.</p>

<p>"Or else," said Jimmy in his hesitating way, "I'll be sending
word to the French Ambassador that 'Monsieur Plessey' is in
London."</p>

<p>The face of the man turned a sickly green.</p>

<p>"Monsieur&mdash;je n'en vois pas la ncessit," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"And who is Plessey?" asked Angel when the man had gone.</p>

<p>"A murderer greatly wanted by the French police," said Jimmy,
"and Spedding has well chosen his instrument. Angel, there will
be trouble before the evening is over."</p>

<p>They ate their dinner in silence, lingering over the coffee.
The Frenchman had taken a table at the other side of the room.
Once when Angel went out he made as though to leave, but seeing
that Jimmy did not move, he changed his mind. Angel dawdled
through the sweet, and took an unconscionable time over his
coffee. Jimmy, fretting to be gone, groaned as his volatile
companion ordered yet another liqueur.</p>

<p>"That's horribly insidious muck to drink," grumbled
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Inelegant, but true," said Angel. He was amused at the
obvious efforts of the spy at the other table to kill time also.
Then suddenly Angel rose, leaving his drink untasted, and
reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said briskly.</p>

<p>"This is very sudden," remarked the impatient Jimmy.</p>

<p>They walked to the desk and paid their bill, and out of the
corner of his eye Angel could see the dapper Frenchman following
them out. They stepped out along Shaftesbury Avenue; then Jimmy
stopped and fumbled in his pocket. In his search he turned
round, facing the direction from which he had come. The dapper
Frenchman was sauntering toward him, whilst behind him came two
roughly-dressed men. Then Jimmy saw the two men quicken their
pace. Passing one on each side of Callvet, each took an arm
affectionately, and the three turned into Rupert Street, Angel
and Jimmy following. Jimmy saw the three bunched together, and
heard the click of the handcuffs. Then Angel whistled a passing
cab. The captive's voice rose. "Stick a handkerchief in his
mouth," said Angel, and one of the men obeyed. The two stood
watching the cab till it turned the corner.</p>

<p>"There is no sense in taking unnecessary risks," said Angel
cheerfully. "It is one thing being a fool, and another being a
silly fool. Now we'll go along and see what else happens."</p>

<p>He explained as he proceeded: "I've wanted Callvet for quite
a long time&mdash;he's on the list, so to speak. I lost sight of
him a year ago. How Spedding got him is a mystery. If the truth
be told, he's got a nodding acquaintance with half the crooks in
London... had a big criminal practice before he went into the
more lucrative side of the law."</p>

<p>A big crowd had gathered at the corner of the Haymarket, and
with one accord they avoided it.</p>

<p>"Curiosity," Angel prattled on, "has been the undoing of many
a poor soul. Keep away from crowds, Jimmy."</p>

<p>They walked on till they came to Angel's flat in Jermyn
Street.</p>

<p>"Spedding will duplicate and triplicate his schemes for
catching us tonight," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"He will," agreed Angel, and opened the door of the house in
which his rooms were. The narrow passageway, in which a light
usually burned day and night, was in darkness.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Angel, stepping back into the street, "oh,
indeed no!"</p>

<p>During their walk Jimmy had had a suspicion that they had
been followed. This suspicion was confirmed when Angel whistled,
and two men crossed the road and joined them.</p>

<p>"Lend me your lamp, Johnson," said Angel, and taking the
bright little electric lamp in his hand, he entered the passage,
followed by the others. They reached the foot of the stairs,
then Angel reached back his hand without a word, and one of the
two men placed therein a stick. Cautiously the party advanced up
the stairway that led to Angel's room.</p>

<p>"Somebody has been here," said Angel, and pointed to a patch
of mud on the carpet. The door was ajar, and Jimmy sent it open
with a kick; then Angel put his arm cautiously into the room and
turned on the light, and the party waited in the darkness for a
movement. There was no sign, and they entered. It did not
require any great ingenuity to see that the place had been
visited. Half-opened drawers, their contents thrown on the
floor, and all the evidence of a hurried search met their eyes.
They passed from the little sitting-room to the bedroom, and
here again the visitors had left traces of their
investigations.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" Jimmy stopped and picked up a soft felt hat. He
looked inside; the dull lining bore the name of an Egyptian
hatter. "Connor's!" he said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Angel softly, "so Connor takes a hand, does
he?"</p>

<p>One of the detectives who had followed them in grasped
Angel's arm.</p>

<p>"Look, sir!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Half-hidden by the heavy hangings of the window, a man
crouched in the shadow.</p>

<p>"Come out of that!" cried Angel.</p>

<p>Then something in the man's attitude arrested his speech. He
slipped forward and pulled back the curtain.</p>

<p>"Connor!" he cried. Connor it was indeed, stone dead, with a
bullet hole in the centre of his forehead.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; OPENING THE
SAFE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE four men stood in silence before the body.
Jimmy bent and touched the hand. "Dead!" he said. Angel made no
reply, but switched on every light in the room. Then he passed
his hands rapidly through the dead man's pockets; the things he
found he passed to one of the other detectives, who laid them on
the table.</p>

<p>"A chisel, a jemmy, a centre-bit, lamp, pistol," enumerated
Angel. "It is not difficult to understand why Connor came here;
but who killed him?"</p>

<p>He made a close inspection of the apartment. The windows were
intact and fastened, there were no signs of a struggle. In the
sitting-room there were muddy footmarks, which might have been
made by Connor or his murderer. In the centre of the room was a
small table. During Angel's frequent absences from his lodgings
he was in the habit of locking his two rooms against his
servants, who did their cleaning under his eye. In consequence,
the polished surface of the little table was covered with a fine
layer of dust, save in one place where there was a curious
circular clearing about eight inches in diameter. Angel examined
this with scrupulous care, gingerly pulling the table to where
the light would fall on it with greater brilliance. The little
circle from whence the dust had disappeared interested him more
than anything else in the room. "You will see that this is not
touched," he said to one of the men; and then to the other, "You
had better go round to Vine Street and report this&mdash;stay, I
will go myself."</p>

<p>As Jimmy and he stepped briskly in the direction of the
historic police station, Angel expressed himself tersely.
"Connor came on his own to burgle; he was surprised by a third
party, who, thinking Connor was myself, shot him."</p>

<p>"That is how I read it," said Jimmy. "But why did Connor
come?"</p>

<p>"I have been expecting Connor," said Angel quietly. "He was
not the sort of man to be cowed by the fear of arrest. He had
got it into his head that I had got the secret of the safe, and
he came to find out."</p>

<p>Inside the station the inspector on duty saluted him.</p>

<p>"We have one of your men inside," he said pleasantly,
referring to the Frenchman; then, noticing the grave faces of
the two, he added, "Is anything wrong, sir?"</p>

<p>Briefly enough the detective gave an account of what had
happened in Jermyn Street. He added his instructions concerning
the table, and left as the inspector was summoning the
divisional surgeon.</p>

<p>"I wonder where we could find Spedding?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Spedding will find us?" added Jimmy
grimly.</p>

<p>Angel looked round in surprise. "Losing your nerve?" he asked
rudely.</p>

<p>"No," said the cool young man by his side slowly; "but
somehow life seems more precious than it was a week ago."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks!" said. Angel. "You're in love."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," admitted Jimmy in a surprised tone, as if the
idea had never occurred to him before. Angel looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," he said; "time for all good people to be in
bed. Being myself of a vicious disposition, and, moreover,
desirous of washing the taste of tragedy out of my mouth, I
suggest we walk steadily to a place of refreshment."</p>

<p>"Angel," said Jimmy, "I cannot help thinking that you like to
hear yourself talk."</p>

<p>"I love it," said Angel frankly.</p>

<p>In a little underground bar in Leicester Square they sat at a
table listening to a little string band worry through the
overture to Lohengrin. The crowded room suited their moods.
Jimmy, in his preoccupation, found the noise, the babble of
voices in many tongues, and the wail of the struggling
orchestra, soothing after the exciting events of the past few
hours. To Angel the human element in the crowd formed
relaxation. The loud-speaking men with their flashy jewellery,
the painted women with their automatic smiles, the sprinkling of
keen-faced sharps he recognized, they formed part of the pageant
of life&mdash;the life as Angel saw it. They sat sipping their
wine until there came a man who, glancing carelessly round the
room, made an imperceptible sign to Angel, and then, as if
having satisfied himself that the man he was looking for was not
present, left the room again. Angel and his companion
followed.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"Spedding goes to the safe tonight," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Good," said Angel.</p>

<p>"The guard at the safe is permanently withdrawn by Spedding's
order."</p>

<p>"That I know," said Angel. "It was withdrawn the very night
the 'Borough Lot' came. On whose behalf is Spedding acting?"</p>

<p>"On behalf of Connor, who I understand is one of the
legatees."</p>

<p>Angel whistled. "Whew! Jimmy, this is to be the Grand
Finale."</p>

<p>He appeared deep in thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary for Miss Kent to be present," he said
after a while.</p>

<p>From a neighbouring district messenger office he got on by
the telephone to a garage, and within half an hour they were
ringing the bell at Kathleen's modest little house.</p>

<p>The girl rose to greet them as they entered. All sign of the
last night's fatigue had vanished.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "I have slept the greater part of the
day."</p>

<p>Angel observed that she studiously kept her eyes from Jimmy,
and that that worthy was preternaturally interested in a large
seascape that hung over the fireplace.</p>

<p>"This is the last occasion we shall be troubling you at so
late an hour," said Angel, "but I am afraid we shall want you
with us tonight."</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you wish," she answered simply. "You have
been, both of you, most kind."</p>

<p>She flashed a glance at Jimmy, and saw for the first time the
surgical dressing on his head. "You&mdash;you are not hurt?" she
cried in alarm, then checked herself.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Jimmy loudly, "nothing, I assure you."</p>

<p>He was in an unusual panic, and wished he had not come.</p>

<p>"He tripped over a hearthrug and fell against a marble
mantelpiece," lied Angel elaborately. "The marble has been in
the possession of my family for centuries, and is now badly, and
I fear irretrievably, damaged."</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled, and his smile was infectious. "A gross libel,
Miss Kent," he said, recovering his nerve. "As a matter of
fact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," interrupted Angel impressively, "Jimmy
was walking in his sleep!"</p>

<p>"Be serious, Mr. Angel," implored the girl, who was now very
concerned as she saw the extent of Jimmy's injury, and noticed
the dark shadows under his eyes.</p>

<p>"Was it Spedding?"</p>

<p>"It was," said Angel promptly. "A little attempt which proved
a failure."</p>

<p>Jimmy saw the concern in the girl's eyes, and, manlike, it
cheered him.</p>

<p>"It is hardly worth talking about," he said hastily, "and I
think we ought not to delay our departure a second."</p>

<p>"I will not keep you a moment longer than I can help," she
said, and left the room to dress herself for the journey.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," said Angel, as soon as she had gone, "cross my hand
with silver, pretty gentleman, and I will tell your
fortune."</p>

<p>"Don't talk rot," replied Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I can see a bright future, a dark lady with big gray eyes,
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, shut up!" growled Jimmy, very red; "she's
coming."</p>

<p>They reached the Safe Deposit when the bells of the city were
chiming the half-hour after eleven.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Better not," advised Angel. "If Spedding knows we have a key
it might spoil the whole show."</p>

<p>So the car slowly patrolled the narrow length of Lombard
Street, an object of professional interest to the half-dozen
plain-clothes policemen who were on duty there. They had three
quarters of an hour to wait, for midnight had rung out from the
belfries long before a big car came gliding into the thoroughfare
from its western end. It stopped with a jerk before the
Safe Deposit, and a top-hatted figure alighted. As he did so,
Angel's car drew up behind, and the three got down.</p>

<p>Spedding, professionally attired in a frock-coat and silk
hat, stood with one foot on the steps of the building and his
hand upon the key he had fitted. He evinced no surprise when he
saw Angel, and bowed slightly to the girl. Then he opened the
door and stepped inside, and Angel and his party followed. He
lit the vestibule, opened the inner door, and walked into the
darkened hall. Again came the click of switches, and every light
in the great hall blazed. The girl shivered a little as she
looked up at the safe, dominating and sinister, a monument of
ruin, a materialization of the dead regrets of a thousand bygone
gamblers. Solitary, alone, aloof it rose, distinct from the
magnificent building in which it stood&mdash;a granite mass set
in fine gold. Old Reale had possessed a good eye for contrasts,
and had truly foreseen how well would the surrounding beauty of
the noble hall emphasize the grim reality of the ugly pedestal.
Spedding closed the door behind them, and surveyed the party
with a triumphant smile.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he said in his smoothest tones, "you have come
too late."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we have," agreed Angel, and the lawyer looked at
him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I wrote you a letter," he said. "Did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I have not been home since this afternoon," said Angel, and
he heard the lawyer's little sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Spedding went on, "that I have to disappoint
you all; but as you know, by the terms of the will the fortunate
person who discovers the word which opens the safe must notify
me, claiming the right to apply the word on the combination
lock."</p>

<p>"That is so," said Angel.</p>

<p>"I have received such a notification from one of the
legatees&mdash;Mr. Connor," the lawyer went on, and drew from
his pocket a paper, "and I have his written authority to open
the safe on his behalf."</p>

<p>He handed the paper to Angel, who examined it and handed it
back.</p>

<p>"It was signed today," was all that he said.</p>

<p>"At two o'clock this afternoon," said the lawyer. "I
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before you go any further, Mr. Spedding," said Angel, "I
might remind you that there is a lady present, and that you have
your hat on."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons," said the lawyer with a sarcastic smile,
and removed his hat. Angel reached out his hand for it, and
mechanically the lawyer relinquished it. Angel looked at the
crown. The nap was rubbed the wrong way, and was covered with
fine dust.</p>

<p>"If you desire to valet me," said the lawyer, "I have no
objection."</p>

<p>Angel made no reply, but placed the hat carefully on the
mosaic floor of the hall.</p>

<p>"If," said the lawyer, "before I open the safe, there is any
question you would like to ask, or any legitimate objection you
would wish to raise, I shall be happy to consider it."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," said Angel.</p>

<p>"Or you?" addressing Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>"Or Miss Kent perhaps&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Kathleen looked him straight in the face as she answered
coldly&mdash;"I am prepared to abide by the action of my
friends."</p>

<p>"There is nothing left for me to do," said the lawyer after
the slightest pause, "but to carry out Mr. Connor's
instructions."</p>

<p>He walked to the foot of the steel stairway and mounted. He
stopped for breath halfway up. He was on a little landing, and
facing him was the polished block of granite that marked where
the ashes of old Reale reposed.</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">PULVIS CINIS ET NIHIL</p>

<p class="first">said the inscription.</p>

<p>"'Dust, cinders and nothing,'" muttered the lawyer, "an apt rebuke
to one seeking the shadows of vanity."</p>

<p>They watched him climb till he reached the broad platform
that fronted the safe door. Then they saw him pull a paper from
his pocket and examine it. He looked at it carefully, then
twisted the dials cautiously till one by one the desired letters
came opposite the pointer. Then he twisted the huge handle of
the safe. He twisted and pulled, but the steel door did not
move. They saw him stoop and examine the dial again, and again
he seized the handle with the same result. A dozen times he went
through the same process, and a dozen times the unyielding door
resisted his efforts. Then he came clattering down the steps,
and almost reeled across the floor of the hall to the little
group. His eyes burnt with an unearthly light, his face was
pallid, and the perspiration lay thick upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"The word!" he gasped. "It's the wrong word."</p>

<p>Angel did not answer him.</p>

<p>"I have tested it a dozen times," cried the lawyer, almost
beside himself, "and it has failed."</p>

<p>"Shall I try?" asked Angel.</p>

<p>"No, no!" the man hissed. "By Heaven, no! I will try again.
One of the letters is wrong; there are two meanings to some of
the symbols." He turned and remounted the stairs.</p>

<p>"The man is suffering," said Jimmy in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Let him suffer," said Angel, a hard look in his eyes. "He
will suffer more before he atones for his villainy. Look, he's
up again. Let the men in, Jimmy, he will find the word this
time&mdash;and take Miss Kent away as soon as the trouble
starts."</p>

<p>The girl saw the sudden mask of hardness that had come over
Angel's face, saw him slip off his overcoat, and heard the
creaking of boots in the hall outside. The pleasant, flippant
man of the world was gone, and the remorseless police officer,
inscrutable as doom, had taken his place. It was a new Angel she
saw, and she drew closer to Jimmy. An exultant shout from the
man at the safe made her raise her eyes. With a flutter at her
heart, she saw the ponderous steel door swing slowly open. Then
from the man came a cry that was like the snarl of some wild
beast.</p>

<p>"Empty!" he roared. He stood stunned and dumb; then he flung
himself into the great steel room, and they heard his voice
reverberating hollowly. Again he came to the platform holding in
his hand a white envelope. Blindly he blundered down the stairs
again, and they could hear his heavy breathing.</p>

<p>"Empty!" His grating voice rose to a scream. "Nothing but
this!" He held the envelope out, then tore it open. It contained
only a few words&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Received on behalf of Miss Kathleen Kent the contents of
this safe.</p>

<p class="letter">"(Signed)<br>
<span class="smcap">
James Cavendish Stannard</span>, Bart.<br>
<span class="smcap">Christopher Angel</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>Dazed and bewildered, the lawyer read the paper, then looked
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"So it was you," he said. Angel nodded curtly.</p>

<p>"You!" said Spedding again. "Yes."</p>

<p>"You have robbed the safe&mdash;you&mdash;a police
officer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angel, not removing his eyes from the man. He
motioned to Jimmy, and Jimmy, with a whispered word to the girl,
led her to the door. Behind him, as he returned to Angel's side,
came six plain-clothes officers.</p>

<p>"So you think you've got me, do you?" breathed Spedding.</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Angel, "I know."</p>

<p>"If you know so much, do you know how near to death you
are?"</p>

<p>"That also I know," said Angel's even voice. "I'm all the
more certain of my danger since I have seen your hat."</p>

<p>The lawyer did not speak.</p>

<p>"I mean," Angel went on calmly, "since I saw the hat that you
put down on a dusty table in my chambers&mdash;when you murdered
Connor."</p>

<p>"Oh, you found him, did you&mdash;I wondered," said Spedding
without emotion.</p>

<p>Then he heard a faint metallic click, and leapt back with his
hand in his pocket. But Jimmy's pistol covered him. He paused
irresolutely for one moment; then six men flung themselves upon
him, and he went to the ground fighting.</p>

<p>Handcuffed, he rose, his nonchalant self, with the full
measure of his failure apparent. He was once again the suave,
smooth man of old. Indeed, he laughed as he faced Angel.</p>

<p>"A good end," he said. "You are a much smarter man than I
thought you were. What is the charge?"</p>

<p>"Murder," said Angel.</p>

<p>"You will find a difficulty in proving it," Spedding answered
coolly, "and as it is customary at this stage of the proceedings
for the accused to make a conventional statement, I formally
declare that I have not seen Connor for two days."</p>

<p>Closely guarded, he walked to the door. He passed Kathleen
standing in the vestibule, and she shrank on one side, which
amused him. He clambered into the car that had brought him,
followed by the policemen, and hummed a little tune. He leaned
over to say a final word to Angel.</p>

<p>"You think I am indecently cheerful," he said, "but I feel as
a man wearied with folly, who has the knowledge that before him
lies the sound sleep that will bring forgetfulness." Then, as
the car was moving off, he spoke again&mdash;"Of course I killed
Connor&mdash;it was inevitable."</p>

<p>And then the car carried him away. Angel locked the door of
the deposit, and handed the key to Kathleen. "I will ask Jimmy
to take you home," he said. "What do you think of him?" said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Spedding? Oh, he's acted as I thought he would. He
represents the very worst type of criminal in the world; you
cannot condemn, any more than you can explain, such men as that.
They are in a class by themselves&mdash;Nature's perversities.
There is a side to Spedding that is particularly pleasant."</p>

<p>He saw the two off, then walked slowly to the City Police
Station. The inspector on duty nodded to him as he entered.</p>

<p>"We have put him in a special cell," he said. "Has he been
well searched?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The usual kit, and a revolver loaded in five
chambers."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Angel. He took the pistol under the
gaslight. One chamber contained an empty shell, and the barrel
was foul. That will hang him without his confession, he
thought.</p>

<p>"He asked for a pencil and paper," said the inspector, "but
he surely does not expect bail."</p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "No, I should imagine he wants to write
to me."</p>

<p>A door burst open, and a bareheaded jailer rushed in.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong in No. 4," he said, and Angel
followed the inspector as he ran down the narrow corridor,
studded with iron doors on either side.</p>

<p>The inspector took one glance through the spy-hole.</p>

<p>"Open the door!" he said quickly. With a jangle and rattle of
bolts, the door was opened. Spedding lay on his back, with a
faint smile on his lips; his eyes were closed, and Angel,
thrusting his hand into the breast of the stricken man, felt no
beat of the heart. "Run for a doctor!" said the inspector. "It's
no use," said Angel quietly, "the man's dead." On the rough bed
lay a piece of paper. It was addressed in the lawyer's bold hand
to Angel Esquire. The detective picked it up and read it.</p>

<p>"Excellent Angel," the letter ran, "the time has come when I
must prove for myself the vexed question of immortality. I would
say that I bear you no ill will, nor your companion, nor the
charming Miss Kent. I would have killed you all, or either, of
course, but happily my intentions have not coincided with my
opportunities. For some time past I have foreseen the
possibility of my present act, and have worn on every suit one
button, which, coloured to resemble its fellows, is in reality a
skilfully moulded pellet of cyanide. Farewell."</p>

<p>Angel looked down at the dead man at his feet. The top
cloth-covered button on the right breast had been torn
away.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE SOLUTION</a></h2>

<p class="first">IF you can understand that all the
extraordinary events of the previous chapters occurred without
the knowledge of Fleet Street, that eminent journalists went
about their business day by day without being any the wiser,
that eager news editors were diligently searching the files of
the provincial press for news items, with the mystery of the
safe at their very door, and that reporters all over London were
wasting their time over wretched little motor-bus accidents and
gas explosions, you will all the easier appreciate the
journalistic explosion that followed the double inquest on
Spedding and his victim.</p>

<p>It is outside the province of this story to instruct the
reader in what is so much technical detail, but it may be said
in passing that no less than twelve reporters, three sub-editors,
two "crime experts," and one publisher were summarily
and incontinently discharged from their various newspapers in
connection with the "Safe Story." The Megaphone alone lost five
men, but then the Megaphone invariably discharges more than any
other paper, because it has got a reputation to sustain. Flaring
contents bills, heavy black headlines, and column upon column of
solid type, told the story of Reale's millions, and the
villainous lawyer, and the remarkable verse, and the "Borough
Lot". There were portraits of Angel and portraits of Jimmy and
portraits of Kathleen (sketched in court and accordingly
repulsive), and plans of the lawyer's house at Clapham and
sketches of the Safe Deposit.</p>

<p>So for the three days that the coroner's inquiry lasted
London, and Fleet Street more especially, revelled in the story
of the old croupier's remarkable will and its tragic
consequences. The Crown solicitors very tactfully skimmed over
Jimmy's adventurous past, were brief in their examination of
Kathleen; but Angel's interrogation lasted the greater part of
five hours, for upon him devolved the task of telling the story
in full.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Angel's evidence was a remarkably
successful effort to justify all that Scotland Yard had done.
There were certain irregularities to be glossed over, topics to
be avoided&mdash;why, for instance, official action was not
taken when it was seen that Spedding contemplated a felony.</p>

<p>Most worthily did Angel hold the fort for officialdom that
day, and when he vacated the box he left behind him the
impression that Scotland Yard was all foreseeing, all wise, and
had added yet another to its list of successful cases.</p>

<p>The newspaper excitement lasted exactly four days. On the
fourth day, speaking at the Annual Congress of the British
Association, Sir William Farran, that great physician, in the
course of an illuminating address on "The first causes of
disease," announced as his firm conviction that all the ills
that flesh is heir to arise primarily from the wearing of boots,
and the excitement that followed the appearance in Cheapside of
a converted Lord Mayor with bare feet will long be remembered in
the history of British journalism. It was enough, at any rate,
to blot out the memory of the Reale case, for immediately
following the vision of a stout and respected member of the
Haberdasher Company in full robes and chain of office entering
the Mansion House insufficiently clad there arose that memorable
newspaper discussion "Boots and Crime," which threatened at one
time to shake established society to its very foundations.</p>

<p>"Bill's a brick," wrote Angel to Jimmy. "I suggested to him
that he might make a sensational statement about microbes, but
he said that the Lancet had worked bugs to death, and offered
the 'no boots' alternative."</p>

<p>It was a fortnight after the inquiry that Jimmy drove to
Streatham to carry out his promise to explain to Kathleen the
solution of the cryptogram. It was his last visit to her, that
much he had decided. His rejection of her offer to equally share
old Reale's fortune left but one course open to him, and that he
elected to take.</p>

<p>She expected him, and he found her sitting before a cosy fire
idly turning the leaves of a book. Jimmy stood for a moment in
an embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had been alone with her, save the
night he drove with her to Streatham, and he was a little at a
loss for an opening.</p>

<p>He began conventionally enough speaking about the weather,
and not to be outdone in commonplace, she ordered tea.</p>

<p>"And now, Miss Kent," he said, "I have got to explain to you
the solution of old Reale's cryptogram."</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper from his pocket covered with
hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>"Where old Reale got his idea of the cryptogram from was, of
course, Egypt. He lived there long enough to be fairly well
acquainted with the picture letters that abound in that country,
and we were fools not to jump at the solution at first. I don't
mean you," he added hastily. "I mean Angel and I and Connor, and
all the people who were associated with him."</p>

<p>The girl was looking at the sheet, and smiled quietly at the
faux pas.</p>

<p>"How he came into touch with the 'professor&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"What has happened to that poor old man?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Angel has got him into some kind of institute," replied
Jimmy. "He's a fairly common type of cranky old gentleman. 'A
science potterer,' Angel calls him, and that is about the
description. He's the sort of man that haunts the Admiralty with
plans for unsinkable battleships, a 'minus genius'&mdash;that's
Angel's description too&mdash;who, with an academic knowledge
and a good memory, produced a reasonably clever little book,
that five hundred other schoolmasters might just as easily have
written. How the professor came into Reale's life we shall never
know. Probably he came across the book and discovered the
author, and trusting to his madness, made a confidant of him. Do
you remember," Jimmy went on, "that you said the figures
reminded you of the Bible? Well, you are right. Almost every
teacher's Bible, I find, has a plate showing how the alphabet
came into existence." He indicated with his finger as he spoke.
"Here is the Egyptian hieroglyphic. Here is a 'hand' that means
'D,' and here is the queer little Hieratic wiggle that means the
same thing, and you see how the Phoenician letter is very little
different to the hieroglyphic, and the Greek 'delta' has become
a triangle, and locally it has become the 'D' we know."</p>

<p>He sketched rapidly. "All this is horribly learned," he said,
"and has got nothing to do with the solution. But old Reale went
through the strange birds, beasts and things till he found six
letters, S P R I N G, which were to form the word that would
open the safe."</p>

<p>"It is very interesting," she said, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"The night you were taken away," said Jimmy, "we found the
word and cleared out the safe in case of accidents. It was a
very risky proceeding on our part, because we had no authority
from you to act on your behalf."</p>

<p>"You did right," she said. She felt it was a feeble
rejoinder, but she could think of nothing better.</p>

<p>"And that is all," he ended abruptly, and looked at the
clock.</p>

<p>"You must have some tea before you go," she said hurriedly.
They heard the weird shriek of a motor-horn outside, and Jimmy
smiled.</p>

<p>"That is Angel's newest discovery," he said, not knowing
whether to bless or curse his energetic friend for spoiling the
tte--tte.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the girl, a little blankly he thought.</p>

<p>"Angel is always experimenting with new noises," said Jimmy,
"and some fellow has introduced him to a motor-siren which is
claimed to possess an almost human voice." The bell tinkled, and
a few seconds after Angel was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>"I have only come for a few minutes," he said cheerfully. "I
wanted to see Jimmy before he sailed, and as I have been called
out of town unexpectedly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before he sails?" she repeated slowly. "Are you going
away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's going away," said Angel, avoiding Jimmy's
scowling eyes. "I thought he would have told you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" began Jimmy.</p>

<p>"He's going into the French Congo to shoot elephants," Angel
rattled on; "though what the poor elephants have done to him I
have yet to discover."</p>

<p>"But this is sudden?" She was busy with the tea things, and
had her back toward them, so Jimmy did not see her hand
tremble.</p>

<p>"You're spilling the milk," said the interfering Angel.
"Shall I help you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she replied tartly.</p>

<p>"This tea is delicious," said Angel, unabashed, as he took
his cup. He had come to perform a duty, and he was going through
with it. "You won't get afternoon tea on the Sangar River,
Jimmy. I know because I have been there, and I wouldn't go
again, not even if they made me governor of the province."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, with a futile attempt to appear
indifferent.</p>

<p>"Please take no notice of Angel, Miss Kent," implored Jimmy,
and added malevolently, "Angel is a big game shot, you know, and
he is anxious to impress you with the extent and dangers of his
travels."</p>

<p>"That is so," agreed Angel contentedly, "but all the same,
Miss Kent, I must stand by what I said in regard to the
'Frongo.' It's a deadly country, full of fever. I've known chaps
to complain of a headache at four o'clock and be dead by ten,
and Jimmy knows it too."</p>

<p>"You are very depressing today, Mr. Angel," said the girl.
She felt unaccountably shaky, and tried to tell herself that it
was because she had not recovered from the effects of her recent
exciting experiences.</p>

<p>"I was with a party once on the Sangar River," Angel said,
cocking a reflective eye at the ceiling. "We were looking for
elephants, too, a terribly dangerous business. I've known a bull
elephant charge a hunter and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Angel!" stormed Jimmy, "will you be kind enough to reserve
your reminiscences for another occasion?"</p>

<p>Angel rose and put down his teacup sadly. "Ah, well!" he
sighed lugubriously, "after all, life is a burden, and one might
as well die in the French Congo&mdash;a particularly lonely
place to die in, I admit&mdash;as anywhere else. Goodbye,
Jimmy!" He held out his hand mournfully.</p>

<p>"Don't be a goat!" entreated Jimmy. "I will let you know from
time to time how I am; you can send your letters via Sierra
Leone."</p>

<p>"The White Man's Grave!" murmured Angel audibly.</p>

<p>"And I'll let you know in plenty of time when I return."</p>

<p>"When!" said Angel significantly. He shook hands limply, and
with the air of a man taking an eternal farewell. Then he left
the room, and they could hear the eerie whine of his patent
siren growing fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>"Confound that chap!" said Jimmy. "With his glum face and
extravagant gloom he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me you were going?" she asked him
quietly. She stood with a neat foot on the fender and her head a
little bent.</p>

<p>"I had come to tell you," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Why are you going?"</p>

<p>Jimmy cleared his throat. "Because I need the change," he
said almost brusquely.</p>

<p>"Are you tired&mdash;of your friends?" she asked, not lifting
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I have so few friends," said Jimmy bitterly. "People here
who are worth knowing know me."</p>

<p>"What do they know?" she asked, and looked at him.</p>

<p>"They know my life," he said doggedly, "from the day I was
sent down from Oxford to the day I succeeded to my uncle's title
and estates. They know I have been all over the world picking up
strange acquaintances. They know I was one of the"&mdash;he
hesitated for a word&mdash;"gang that robbed Rahbat Pasha's
bank; that I held a big share in Reale's ventures&mdash;a share
he robbed me of, but let that pass; that my life has been
consistently employed in evading the law."</p>

<p>"For whose benefit?" she asked.</p>

<p>"God knows," he said wearily, "not for mine. I have never
felt the need of money, my uncle saw to that. I should never
have seen Reale again but for a desire to get justice. If you
think I have robbed for gain, you are mistaken. I have robbed
for the game's sake, for the excitement of it, for the constant
fight of wits against men as keen as myself. Men like Angel made
me a thief."</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;?" she asked.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, straightening himself up, "I am done with
the old life. I am sick and sorry&mdash;and finished."</p>

<p>"And is this African trip part of your scheme of penitence?"
she asked. "Or are you going away because you want to
forget&mdash;" Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and her
eyes were looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked huskily.</p>

<p>"To forget&mdash;me," she breathed.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "that is what I want to forget."</p>

<p>"Why?" she said, not looking at him.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;oh, because I love you too much, dear, to want
to drag you down to my level. I love you more than I thought it
possible to love a woman&mdash;so much, that I am happy to
sacrifice the dearest wish of my heart, because I think I will
serve you better by leaving you." He took her hand and held it
between his two strong hands.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," she whispered, so that he had to bend
closer to hear what she said, "don't you think I&mdash;I ought
to be consulted?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you," he cried in wonderment, "would
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him with a smile, and her eyes were radiant
with unspoken happiness. "I want you, Jimmy," she said. It was
the first time she had called him by name. "I want you,
dear."</p>

<p>His arms were about her, and her lips met his. They did not
hear the tinkle of the bell, but they heard the knock at the
door, and the girl slipped from his arms and was collecting the
tea-things when Angel walked in. He looked at Jimmy inanely,
fiddling with his watch chain, and he looked at the girl.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry to intrude again," he said, "but I got a wire
at the little post-office up the road telling me I needn't take
the case at Newcastle, so I thought I'd come back and tell you,
Jimmy, that I will take what I might call a 'cemetery drink'
with you tonight."</p>

<p>"I am not going," said Jimmy, recovering his calm.</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not going?" said the astonished Angel.</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, speaking over his shoulder, "I have
persuaded him to stay."</p>

<p>"Ah, so I see!" said Angel, stooping to pick up two hairpins
that lay on the hearthrug.</p>
