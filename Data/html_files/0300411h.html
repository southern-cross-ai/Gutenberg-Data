<h2>THE GUERMANTES WAY</h2>
<br>
<a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>
<h3><i>CHAPTER ONE</i></h3>
<h4>[THE DUCHESSE DE GUERMANTES]</h4>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> twittering of the birds at
daybreak sounded insipid to Françoise. Every word uttered by the
maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running
about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other
words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less
noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had
made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced
even silence with a strained attention. And as our new
neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to
which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct
at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestral
<i>motif</i>) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a
Françoise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her
in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was 'so
well respected on all sides' and had packed her trunks with
tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all
possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I,
who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to
abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old
servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a
building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did
not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral
wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of
dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling;
certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him,
who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to
conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were
all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one's
surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had
actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold
in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a
draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen
the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so
smart a place, having always longed to be with people who
travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went
straight to Françoise, who, in return for my having laughed at
her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an
icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The
'sensibility' claimed by neurotic people is matched by their
egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the
sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in
themselves. Françoise, who would not allow the least of her own
ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head
from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my
sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as
soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover,
having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house
we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been
overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still
a 'temperature,' and like a boa constrictor that has just
swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a
long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Françoise, with
true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really
thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy,
that she had found it quite a day's journey to get there, that
never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to
live there for a king's ransom, not if you were to offer her
millions&mdash;a pure hypothesis&mdash;and that everything
(everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and 'usual
offices') was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it
is high time now that the reader should be told&mdash;and told
also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having
been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from
her), was in need of better air&mdash;was a flat forming part of
the Hôtel de Guermantes.</p>
<p>At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable
which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it
connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to
identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to
seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we
have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it
is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality,
as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe
which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there
is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town
or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its
spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden
in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the
life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the
atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after
having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic
lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window,
began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated
it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams.</p>
<p>And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the
real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the
name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the
fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person,
but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and
with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which
was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy Mélusine
should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive
'restorations' of which we may end by finding, as their original,
the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to
meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for
identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we
know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in
the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year&mdash;like
those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the
manner of the various artists who have sung or played into
them&mdash;enable our memory to make us hear that name with the
particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then,
while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the
distance that separates the dreams which at different times its
same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear
echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as
from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact,
forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had
believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we
were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same
canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted
memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that
composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless
harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and
which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by
any chance the name 'Guermantes,' resuming for a moment, after
all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day,
which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied's marriage,
brings back to me that mauve&mdash;so delicate, almost too
bright, too new&mdash;with which the billowy scarf of the young
Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond
reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an
azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like
one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen,
or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what
it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of
that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by
the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which
now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red
woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium
scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety
which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart
from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the
original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of
the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily
life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names
have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too
quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our
musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to
slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne
alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but
entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course
of our existence have been successively presented to us by a
single name.</p>
<p>What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when
my first nurse&mdash;knowing no more, probably, than I know
to-day in whose honour it had been composed&mdash;sang me to
sleep with that old ditty, <i>Gloire À la Marquise de
Guermantes</i>, or when, some years later, the veteran Maréchal
de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid's bosom swell with pride,
stopped in the Champs-Elysées to remark: "A fine child that!" and
gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of
course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no
longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn
nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we
were born&mdash;from the accounts given me by other people. But
more recently I find in the period of that name's occupation of
me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively
assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my
musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no
longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less
advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And,
with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her
dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from
year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and
modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected
them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the
surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no
more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which
the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals,
had given place&mdash;right at the end of that 'Guermantes way'
along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my
parents the course of the Vivonne&mdash;to that land of bubbling
streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know
the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned
the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the
ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud
race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses
the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still
empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of
Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill
of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like
the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with
Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see
whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the
types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth,
brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers,
where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains
of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close
of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road,
outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the
black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this 'Guermantes,'
like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could
with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to
discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a
sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few
miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places
round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or
of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical
conditions&mdash;in the realm of topographical
science&mdash;required for the production of an unaccountable
phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the
windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after
century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest,
this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the
corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the
North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group
themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to
inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle
triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the
famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and
blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud
from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient
forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this
delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the
ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to
see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in
contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the
princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her
face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves
and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old
customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup;
he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes
only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired
it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their
title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes
had received its name from the castle round which it had been
built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the
castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its
streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the
tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth
century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung,
interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which
he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in
'adrianople' and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had
introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of
Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract
solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar
of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the
castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me,
surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her
house in Paris, the Hôtel de Guermantes, limpid like its name,
for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and
blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the
temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this Hôtel de
Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the
Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were
for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively
persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and
protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a
vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its
circumference increased.</p>
<p>In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the
guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making
any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human
and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less
material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral
ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de
Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a
showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes
about his cousin's chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the
Hôtel de Guermantes had become&mdash;as the Louvre might have
been in days gone by&mdash;a kind of castle, surrounded, in the
very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance,
by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over
which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling
itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de
Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme.
de Guermantes in a wing of the Hôtel. It was one of those old
town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in
which the court of honour&mdash;whether they were alluvial
deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a
legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were
clustered round the overlord&mdash;is flanked by little shops and
workrooms, a shoemaker's, for instance, or a tailor's, such as we
see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the
aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such
accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows
flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a 'Comtesse'
who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting
on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the
plot by the porter's lodge (with, by the coachman's side on the
box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic
mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and
waves her hand in greeting to the porter's children and to such
of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing,
who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all
the same.</p>
<p>In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady
at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite
young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to
Françoise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the
Guermantes (to whom Françoise regularly alluded as the people
'below,' or 'downstairs') were her constant preoccupation from
the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma's hair,
casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the
courtyard, she would say: "Look at that, now; a pair of holy
Sisters; that'll be for downstairs, surely;" or, "Oh! just look
at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where
they came from, the Duke will have been out with his
gun!"&mdash;until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while
she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a
song, she would conclude: "They're having company down below; gay
doings, I'll be bound;" whereupon, in her symmetrical face,
beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her
young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of
her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and
special order, as though for a country-dance.</p>
<p>But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the
keenest interest in Françoise, gave her the most complete
satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that
at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust
apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a
little while after our servants had finished the celebration of
that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called
their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my
father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover
that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth
peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore
have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without
trouble in store for himself. For Françoise (who, in her old age,
lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without
fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face
covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made
visible&mdash;though by no means legible&mdash;to the outer world
the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her
dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running
'aside,' but not so that we could catch her words. She called
this practice&mdash;which, she imagined, must be infuriating,
'mortifying' as she herself put it,'vexing' to us&mdash;'saying
low masses all the blessed day.'</p>
<p>The last rites accomplished, Françoise, who was at one and the
same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of
the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin
from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of
watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a
doleful eye to thank 'her' young footman who, to shew his zeal in
her service, was saying: "Come, ma'am, a drop more of the grape;
it's d'licious to-day," and went straight across to the window,
which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe
in 'this wretched kitchen.' Dexterously casting, as she turned
the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied
indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the
conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded
for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting
carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of
the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had
already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of
the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place
where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the
chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to
hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray.</p>
<p>"Ah! Combray, Combray!" she cried. And the almost singing tone
in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the
Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect
her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was
lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he
would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province
that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly
meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those
pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are
characteristic of the Southerner? "Ah, Combray, when shall I look
on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among
thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the
grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like
someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young
master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without
having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then
he makes out I don't come quick enough; you'd need to hear the
bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you're a minute late,
away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray;
maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a
stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I
smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of
death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell
which will have driven me to damnation in this world."</p>
<p>Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the
waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my
grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on
Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in
Franchise's affections. Having raised his head when he heard our
window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract
his neighbour's attention, in order to bid her good day. The
coquetry of the young girl that Françoise had once been softened
and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook,
dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and
it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty
that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker,
but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe
Mamma's orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never
have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which
would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on
her 'a whole chapter' from the Mistress. She pointed to the
waiting carriage, as who should say: "A fine pair, eh!" though
what she actually muttered was: "What an old rattle-trap!" but
principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer,
putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having
to shout:</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> could have one too if you liked, as good as they
have and better, I dare say, only you don't care for that sort of
thing."</p>
<p>And Françoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the
meaning of which was, more or less: "Tastes differ, you know;
simplicity's the rule in this house," shut the window again in
case Mamma should come in. These 'you' who might have had more
horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right
in saying 'you' since, except for a few purely personal
gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without
ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her
cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that
she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which
they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches,
eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the
ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Françoise lived with us
in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth,
our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of
concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was
formed&mdash;with the addition of the recognised rights of freely
practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the
traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the
window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering
in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a
holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece&mdash;the
portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it
can be understood that Françoise might well have succumbed in
those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my
father's claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady
which she herself called 'wearying,' wearying in the active sense
in which the word <i>ennui</i> is employed by Corneille, or in
the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives
because they are wearying for their girls or for their native
villages. Françoise's wearying had soon been cured by none other
than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen,
indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to
keep a carriage. "Very good class, those Juliens," (for Françoise
readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already
familiar) "very worthy people; you can see it written on their
faces." Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the
world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no
wish for one. This new friend of Françoise was very little at
home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A
waistcoat-maker first of all, with the 'chit of a girl' whom my
grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest
in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when
still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning
a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on
Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies' fashions and become a
seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker's
workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a
button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and
eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief
assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies
of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard,
generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom,
whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien's
presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little
girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats
still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one
besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside.
He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had
definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun
by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the 'regular
establishment' was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks
after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear
on her long enough to help Françoise to pass through the first,
most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time,
and without underrating his value to Françoise as, so to speak, a
sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that
my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a
little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump
cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his
eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led
one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a
great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as
soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was
perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted
from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which
was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being
made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at
a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner
who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly
how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by
cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien's (here the
comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed,
corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his
eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I
soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most
spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come
across, in the sense that, probably without education, he
possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books
skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The
most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was
convinced that Jupien's life would soon be cut short. Kindness
was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most
generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of
Françoise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to
put up with understudies.</p>
<p>Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a
parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely
pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Françoise so skilfully put to
the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen,
while he waited for Mamma's answer, that it was very seldom that
the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon
his memory the conviction that, if we 'did not have' any
particular thing, it was because we had 'no wish' for it. If she
made such a point of other people's knowing that we 'had money'
(for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive
articles, and said simply 'have money,' 'fetch water'), of their
realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with
nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the
supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal
either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition
of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and
charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come
in time to invest each with the other's attributes, to expect
some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying
in riches.</p>
<p>As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did
quickly&mdash;otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on
her 'every conceivable insult'&mdash;Françoise began with many
groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table.</p>
<p>"There are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,"
began my father's valet; "I had a friend who used to be with
them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my
old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army
with one of the Baron de Guermantes's stud grooms. Does your
mother know you're out?" added the valet, who was in the habit,
just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of
peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms.</p>
<p>Françoise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which
moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made
out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there
must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to
the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable
emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him,
therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should
say: "Always the same, that Victor!" And she was genuinely
pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was
akin&mdash;if remotely&mdash;to those reputable social pleasures
for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress
themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold.
Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own
heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation,
the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce
against the clergy. Françoise had not yet learned that our
cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to
convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may
make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of
justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps
give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of
displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once
terrible and triumphant.</p>
<p>"The Duchess must be connected with all that lot," said
Françoise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of
the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the
andante. "I can't recall who it was told me that one of them had
married a cousin of the Duke. It's the same kindred, anyway. Ay,
they're a great family, the Guermantes!" she added, in a tone of
respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the
number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as
Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the
Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single
word 'great' to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they
formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes,
shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a
ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. "I wonder now if
it wouldn't be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a
score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their
cousin at Algiers, too." My mother and I long asked ourselves who
this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that
Françoise meant by the name 'Algiers' the town of Angers. What is
far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near.
Françoise, who knew the name 'Algiers' from some particularly
unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had
never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language
itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn
with errors. "I meant to talk to their butler about it. What is
it again you call him?" she interrupted herself as though putting
a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on
to answer with: "Oh, of course, it's Antoine you call him!" as
though Antoine had been a title. "He's the one who could tell me,
but he's quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you'd say
they'd cut his tongue out, or that he'd forgotten to learn to
speak. He makes no response when you talk to him," went on
Françoise, who used 'make response' in the same sense as Mme. de
Sévigné. "But," she added, quite untruthfully, "so long as I know
what's boiling in my pot, I don't bother my head about what's in
other people's. Whatever he is, he's not a Catholic. Besides,
he's not a courageous man." (This criticism might have led one to
suppose that Françoise had changed her mind about physical
bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to
the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. 'Courageous' meant
simply a hard worker.) "They do say, too, that he's thievish as a
magpie, but it doesn't do to believe all one hears. The servants
never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are
jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it's safe to say
that he's a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no
better," concluded Françoise, who, in furnishing the name
'Antoine' with a feminine ending that would designate the
butler's wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of
word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words
<i>chanoine</i> and <i>chanoinesse</i>. If so, she was not far
wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue
Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it
was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of
olden days of whom Françoise was, properly speaking, the
contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another
example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on:
"But one thing sure and certain is that it's the Duchess that has
Guermantes Castle. And it's she that is the Lady Mayoress down in
those parts. That's always something."</p>
<p>"I can well believe that it is something," came with
conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony.</p>
<p>"You think so, do you, my boy, you think it's something? Why,
for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it's just thank you
for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you
wouldn't see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I'm sure a
family who've got something to go on with, like Monsieur and
Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched
town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they're free
to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off
retiring? They've got everything they want. Why wait till they're
dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot
to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I'd have of it at home in
my brother's poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel
you're alive; you haven't all these houses stuck up in front of
you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the
frogs singing five miles off and more."</p>
<p>"That must indeed be fine!" exclaimed the young footman with
enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar
to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in
the household than my father's valet, he used to talk to
Françoise about things which might interest not himself so much
as her. And Françoise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she
was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who
referred to her always as the 'housekeeper,' that peculiar
tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the
well-meaning young men who dignify them with a 'Highness.'</p>
<p>"At any rate one knows what one's about, there, and what time
of year it is. It isn't like here where you won't find one
wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you
would at Christmas, and I can't hear so much as the tiniest
angelus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning.
Down there, you can hear every hour; there's only the one poor
bell, but you say to yourself: 'My brother will be coming in from
the field now,' and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell
rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take
a turn before you light the lamp. But here it's daytime and it's
night time, and you go to bed, and you can't say any more than
the dumb beasts what you've been about all day."</p>
<p>"I gather Méséglise is a fine place, too, Madame," broke in
the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a
little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember
having heard us, at table, mention Méséglise.</p>
<p>"Oh! Méséglise, is it?" said Françoise with the broad smile
which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those
names&mdash;Méséglise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so
intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them
outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more
or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by
making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the
students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from
the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from
the feeling that these places were something to her which they
were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one
has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found
in them something witty, because she did find there a great part
of herself.</p>
<p>"Yes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is
Méséglise;" she went on with a tinkling laugh, "but how did you
ever come to hear tell of Méséglise?"</p>
<p>"How did I hear of Méséglise? But it's a well-known place;
people have told me about it&mdash;yes, over and over again," he
assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who,
whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the
importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other
people, makes it impossible for us to succeed.</p>
<p>"I can tell you, it's better down there, under the cherry
trees, than standing before the fire all day."</p>
<p>She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since
Eulalie's death Françoise had completely forgotten that she had
loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose
cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came,
like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to
'put on airs.' It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so
skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her 'trifle'
from my aunt. As for the latter, Françoise never left off singing
her praises.</p>
<p>"But it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a
cousin of Madame?" asked the young footman.</p>
<p>"Yes, with Mme. Octave&mdash;oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my
poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to
spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say,
who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything;
you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat
that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine,
and red wine, and everything you could wish." (Françoise used the
word 'pity' in the sense given it by Labruyère.) "It was she that
paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months
and years." (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for
Françoise belonged to an epoch when the words 'damages' was not
restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) "Ah, I can
tell you, people didn't go empty away from that house. As his
reverence the Curé has told us, many's the time, if there ever
was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne
of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in
the little voice she had: 'You know, Françoise, I can eat nothing
myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if
I could.' They weren't for her, the victuals, you may be quite
sure. If you'd only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of
cherries; there wasn't that much of her. She would never listen
to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it
wasn't in that house that you'd have to gobble down your dinner.
She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it's been just
the same again to-day; we haven't had time for so much as to
break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and
drakes."</p>
<p>What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled
bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had
them simply to give himself airs and to keep her 'dancing.' "I
can tell you frankly," the young footman assured her, "that I
never saw the like." He said it as if he had seen everything, and
as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over
all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to
be found a custom of eating pulled bread. "Yes, yes," the butler
muttered, "but that will all be changed; the men are going on
strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other
evening that he's clearing two hundred thousand francs out of
it." There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was
not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all
politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less
serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask
himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and
was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have
been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my
father's immediately turning him out of the house. But the
philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Françoise to expect
that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use
of pulled bread. "So long as the world goes round, look, there'll
be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their
bidding." In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the
last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ
the same measures of time as Françoise in reckoning the duration
of the latter's dinner) had been saying:</p>
<p>"What on earth can they be doing? They've been at least two
hours at their dinner."</p>
<p>And she rang timidly three or four times. Françoise, 'her'
footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to
themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like
the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next
part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that
there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when
the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants
began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time
left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal
somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went
their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a
cigarette outside the door, Françoise, after a string of
reflexions on ourselves, such as: "They've got the jumps to-day,
surely," going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the
butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my
bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private
correspondence.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Françoise had
been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the
Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial
right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over
which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small
and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at
length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or
fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial
bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge
either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles,
charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just
as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become
for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the
total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth's
surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by
telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in
his 'Harmonies in Blue and Silver,' so the name Guermantes had
seen perish under the strokes of Françoise's hammer the last of
the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an
old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: "She
is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the
leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain." No doubt the most
exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other
mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too
(and it was to be the last of the series), there was something,
however humble, quite apart from its material components, a
secret differentiation.</p>
<p>And it became all the more essential that I should be able to
explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her
friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her
person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or
in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the
church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash
of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable
by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the
banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like
a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and
which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over
the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance
had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed
itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after
the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my
thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my
impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her
window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least
if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I
cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the
whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she
seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without
discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting
that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her
dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing
herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had
aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary
women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the
street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the
morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of
the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading
familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a
tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass
playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with
passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has
consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court,
this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in
this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to
see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs,
straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the
movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted
on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of
life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan
would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the
traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange
town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in
penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so
I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into
Mme. de Guermantes's house, were I one of her friends, were I to
penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its
glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively
enclose for other people, since, after all, my father's friend
had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in
the Faubourg Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a
source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I
felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house
that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess's
parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of
people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change
their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of
the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped
to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of
an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with
moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was
thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and
the Presence of Our Lord's Body in the Host seemed to me no more
obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg,
situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that
from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being
beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the
Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it
was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the
Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond
that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say,
having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door
stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could
their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush,
into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have
failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be
geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained
to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people
who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de
Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all
of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the
Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then,
majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of
those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one
tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of
a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there
were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the
columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties
it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select
her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the
dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of
the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative
pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden
that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where
on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade
brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit
there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron
chairs&mdash;endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern
sofa&mdash;without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg
Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis
of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only
imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain
objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas,
those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local
curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,
never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them.
And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I
sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever
landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm,
like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the
well-trodden doormat of its shore.</p>
<p>But if the Hôtel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door,
its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way
farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other
tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates,
whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in
his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard,
according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his
shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours,
with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than
the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at
a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once,
indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien's shop, whereupon
Jupien, to the Duke's indignation, demanded compensation. "If it
were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la
Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish," said M. de
Guermantes, "it is an outrage on this fellow's part to claim a
penny from us." But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not
having the faintest idea what 'good' the Duchess had ever done.
And yet she did do good, but&mdash;since one cannot do good to
everybody at once&mdash;the memory of the benefits that we have
heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from
helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the
stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the
quarter appeared to the Duke&mdash;and this over a considerable
area&mdash;to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer
track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted
by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the
neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage
holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who
stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid
clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his
eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box,
drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off
with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the
Champs-Elysées. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving
the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his
world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class
parents, were never at home to look after their children, since
every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study
counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve
wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de
Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he
like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on
their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old
Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact,
met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he
came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one
who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and
was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank,
was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure,
clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the
place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word
to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called
him 'M. Norpois,' not being certain of his name.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait
a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois
next!" exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was
at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him
as 'Monsieur,' instead of 'Monsieur le Duc.'</p>
<p>One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a
matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had
introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had
often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon
as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with
his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving
his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard,
straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable
deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days
gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own,
patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan's or
courtier's shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no
bargain about my father's right to the privilege of contact with
the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely
annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the
carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping
bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the
carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name;
but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face
either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed
out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable,
would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of
Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by
my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering
that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that
I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I
was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of
my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use
of establishing precedents that would do me no good.</p>
<p>As one of Mme. de Guermantes's footmen was in the habit of
talking to Françoise, I picked up the names of several of the
houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of
them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of
that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were
they not inconceivable?</p>
<p>"To-night there's a big party with a Chinese shadow show at
the Princesse de Parme's," said the footman, "but we shan't be
going, because at five o'clock Madame is taking the train to
Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Duc d'Aumale; but it'll
be the lady's maid and valet that are going with her. I'm to stay
here. She won't be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won't,
that's four times already she's written to Madame la
Duchesse."</p>
<p>"Then you won't be going down to Guermantes Castle this
year?"</p>
<p>"It's the first time we shan't be going there: it's because of
the Duke's rheumatics, the doctor says he's not to go there till
the hot pipes are in, but we've been there every year till now,
right on to January. If the hot pipes aren't ready, perhaps
Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de
Guise, but nothing's settled yet."</p>
<p>"And to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?"</p>
<p>"We go now and then to the Opéra, usually on the evenings when
the Princesse de Parme has her box, that's once a week; it seems
it's a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything.
Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same
to the boxes Madame's friends take, one one night, another
another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke's
cousin's lady. She's sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you've
got to run upstairs again now, have you?" went on the footman,
who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters
in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to
treat Françoise with as much respect as if she too were in
service with a duchess. "You enjoy good health, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Oh, if it wasn't for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain
I can still get along" ('on the plain' meant in the courtyard or
in the streets, where Françoise had no objection to walking, in
other words 'on a plane surface') "but it's these stairs that do
me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again,
perhaps, this evening."</p>
<p>She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations
with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes
often bore a princely title which they retained until their
fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended
with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt
against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France,
be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Françoise, to
whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless
telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and
without her slackening for an instant the movements with which
she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if
she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature,
and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally
called Prince d'Oléron, would at once exclaim: "That's fine, that
is!" and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a
stained window in church.</p>
<p>Françoise learned also from the Prince d'Agrigente's valet,
who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with
notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of
talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup
to Mlle. d'Ambresac, and that it was practically settled.</p>
<p>That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes
transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be
places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of
Parme, of Guermantes-Bavière, differentiated from all possible
others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the
daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as
with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those
holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of
Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it.
Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different
determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it,
without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply
floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the
tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her
luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but,
in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian
society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among
numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on
that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus
made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course
of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in
succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a
party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or
opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes.</p>
<p>As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities
of that person's life, our recollections of the people he knows
and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned
from Françoise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to
luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday,
emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over
which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises
above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small
compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with
roseate nacre.</p>
<p>My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who,
to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to
prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people
called him, for short, 'A.J.' Well, somehow or other, this A. J.
found himself entitled to a stall at the Opéra-Comique on a gala
night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had
not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give
an act of <i>Phèdre</i>, my grandmother persuaded my father to
pass it on to me.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this
possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had
plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a
sense of melancholy that I realised the fact of my indifference
to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything.
It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an
opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles
of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But
my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great
actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries,
certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner
faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma;
my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant
worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart
that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like
those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had
to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in
eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No
deep-lying soul inhabited it any more.</p>
<p>That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received
from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera,
I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de
Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask
some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken,
but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class
of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in
which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the
box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from
personal details of similarity, there was still at this period
between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility
and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or 'big
business' a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter
would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by
adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the
great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of
considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience,
a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of
his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus
dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred
threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his
person, more than one wealthy banker's son, entering the theatre
at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a
person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an
astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently
appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian
Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the
time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I
reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his
double) say with a smile: "I don't know the number; it was my
cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box."</p>
<p>He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of
the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able
to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her
unimaginable life in her cousin's box) that his eyes formed a
mental picture when he referred to 'my cousin who told me I had
only to ask for her box,' so much so that that smiling gaze
peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far
more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the
alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague
distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the
attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday
life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he
was directed after mentioning the word 'box' and along which he
now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to
subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs.
I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away
from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly
fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in
making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the
Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de
Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external
to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected
by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that
deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the
Greek warrior in the hour of battle.</p>
<p>I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from
<i>Phèdre</i> which I could not quite remember. In the form in
which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of
feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its
unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though
no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to
learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from
that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions.
But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an
inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line
at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess
floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that
rises to burst on the water's brink. And, after all, this
excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a
single foot.</p>
<p>A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale
at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity,
by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they
might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters.
And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life,
ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public,
for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her
friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was
like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to
sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he
knew.</p>
<p>Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the
regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable
of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark
that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their
own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what
was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did
happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear
Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing,
of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside
him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the
fugitive&mdash;avoiding with apparent want of politeness the
intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has
discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand
indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the
three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had
time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the
Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and
spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he
tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand
it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the
general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little
drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in
so many little cafés, to which one might go for refreshment,
without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt
frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the
establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on
the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the
lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the
extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair
of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of
palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds
free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds.</p>
<p>At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which
one suddenly struck&mdash;like the gleam of a precious stone
which one cannot see&mdash;the phosphorescence of a pair of
famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark
background, the bent profile of the Duc d'Aumale, to whom an
invisible lady was exclaiming "Monseigneur must allow me to take
his coat," to which the Prince replied, "Oh, come, come! Really,
Madame d'Ambresac." She took it, in spite of this vague
prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus
honoured.</p>
<p>But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities
who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against
their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however,
as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached
themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they
patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed
their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the
limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which
their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of
the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their
hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the
tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them,
began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated
from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and
there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid,
mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its
shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon
the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of
optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with
those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that
they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be
considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad
if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely,
minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond
this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the
radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to
smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities
of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a
polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of
seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards
these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood
parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic,
had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then,
the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious
sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging
back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night.
But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild
desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses
who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of
semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the
Princesse de Guermantes.</p>
<p>Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the
sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained
a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a
reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was
probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray
of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing
crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain
subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a
bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks,
the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish,
amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in
the softness of a halcyon's nest. Over her hair, reaching in
front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of
her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells
which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated
with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and
at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths
of which even then a human presence was revealed by the
ubiquitous flashing of the Princess's eyes. The beauty which set
her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was
not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her
neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite,
unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the
inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help
prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman
like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of
darkness.</p>
<p>"That's the Princesse de Guermantes," said my neighbour to the
gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word 'Princesse'
with a string of 'P's, to shew that a title like that was absurd.
"She hasn't been sparing with her pearls. I'm sure, if I had as
many as that, I wouldn't make such a display of them; it doesn't
look at all well, not to my mind."</p>
<p>And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who
were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing
up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed,
with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with
Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one
to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red
nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint
moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in
themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the
conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a
famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively,
the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and
that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided
it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like
certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set
at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a
butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious
face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her
box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of
signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavière,
who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times
formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of
specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the
authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of
evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess
in her palaces in Munich and in Paris.</p>
<p>Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which
always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every
time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de
Guermantes-Bavière, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century
masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid
myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in
offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail
coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and
her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience.
I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game,
and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which,
presumably, this was not where they spent the important part)
they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they
were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed
of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the
step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and
circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the
moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying,
with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): "Do
have one, won't you?" What mattered that to me? I should have
found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the
style of Mérimée or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess
to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime
thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve,
doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live
their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering
with the same mysterious bitterness: "Thanks; I should like a
cherry." And I should have listened to this dialogue with the
same avidity as to a scene from <i>Le Mari de la Débutante</i>,
where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so
familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he
chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in
itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all
the more mysterious and instructive.</p>
<p>"That fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganançay," came in a
knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught
the name whispered in the row behind.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of
his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his
monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the
transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the
stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of
curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and
again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience
could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming,
about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in
me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity
with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the
Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him,
at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of
diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to
liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely
material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least
reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the
darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now,
because the act of <i>Phèdre</i> in which Berma was playing was
due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box;
whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the
zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but
the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now,
emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess,
ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like
some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Zaïre, or
perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the
front row I saw that the soft halcyon's nest which tenderly
shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was&mdash;downy, dazzling,
velvety, an immense bird of paradise.</p>
<p>But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de
Guermantes's box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed,
plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young
men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain
went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that
there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period
when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which
I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind
prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to
Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact
observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear
lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist's part or an
incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from
presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should
not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect
conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was
consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still
a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with
their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony
covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women
selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in
the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my
impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable
from them. <i>Phèdre</i>, the 'Declaration Scene,' Berma, had had
then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the
world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go
to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I
opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still
absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to
me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading
mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on
getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in
an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to
possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,
<i>Phèdre</i> and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped
in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose
of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to
analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have
been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that
accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when,
ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I
should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now,
like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky,
but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary
field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and
was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took
cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the
same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best
possible way these lines of <i>Phèdre</i>, which themselves no
longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from
everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines
ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of
which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was
all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and
active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the
other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from
year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of
danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of
sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a
picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on
which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did
go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going
that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little
while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place
without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries
for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights,
so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its
object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its
vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic
whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is
exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to
everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most
carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction,
concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as
their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid
down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams
while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay
the thought of perfection.</p>
<p>I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion
towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I
had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ismène
and Hippolyte. It was not that the players&mdash;they were the
same, by the way&mdash;did not still seek, with the same
intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or
a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude,
or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations
bade the voice: "Be gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and
woo"; or else, "now wax furious," and then hurled themselves upon
it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But
it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably
their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its
everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total
of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in
the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter.</p>
<p>Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to
their garments: "Be majestic." But each of these unsubmissive
members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a
biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express
the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence,
instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular
attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again
along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs
falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy.
At this point the little woman who was sitting near me
exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Not a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She's too old;
she can't play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago."</p>
<p>Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young
men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury
raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be
prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who
had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she
was always making business or social appointments which she was
prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies
along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which
she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to
bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all
her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so
voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of
squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms.
But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success,
and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just
come on to the stage. And then&mdash;oh, the miracle&mdash;like
those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and
find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too,
those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our
memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no
longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they
were in life&mdash;the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when
I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after
these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed
itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my
admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I
deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part
common to all the actresses who appeared as Phèdre, which I had
myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of
subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the
talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover
outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a
great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil
when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a
pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is
a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of
muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects,
all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the
listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can
discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing
is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting,
that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a
window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which
surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and
mimicry of Aricie, Ismène or Hippolyte I had been able to
distinguish, but Phèdre had taken hers into herself, and my mind
had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in
apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces
those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so
completely had they been absorbed. Berma's voice, in which not
one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained
undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it
of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had
not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the
marble voice of Aricie or Ismène, but had been brought to an
exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the
instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one
says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical
peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical
landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an
inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been
transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely,
appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma's arms, which the lines
themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue
from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves
disturbed by a gush of water; her attitude, on the stage, which
she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further,
and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity
from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her
fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original
deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which
they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements
rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as
an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils
themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living
substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan,
half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail,
shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures,
veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which
a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies,
covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from
seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which
the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional
envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater
splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had
spread itself through them, than layers of different substances,
grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only
of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray
that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more
precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is
enshrined. So Berma's interpretation was, around Racine's work, a
second work, quickened also by the breath of genius.</p>
<p>My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant
than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I
no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and
false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic
genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I
had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it
was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the
Champs-Elysées, I had come to her with too strong a desire.
Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this
resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us
by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked
individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought
to it the ideas of 'beauty,' 'breadth of style,' 'pathos' and so
forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the
illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a 'correct'
face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the
insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no
intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the
unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative
intonation. It asks itself: "Is that good? Is what I am feeling
just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility,
strength?" And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a
curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a
person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is
no room left for 'breadth of interpretation.' And for this reason
it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with
sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the
storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an
individual impression.</p>
<p>This was precisely what Berma's acting shewed me. This was
what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I
could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful
interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were
conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars,
Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical
mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to
things in another; between the two we can establish a certain
correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow,
this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that
afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my
ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in
correlating my ideas of 'nobility of interpretation,' of
'originality,' and had broken out in applause only after a moment
of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my
actual impression but was connected in some way with my
preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to
myself: "At last I am listening to Berma." And the difference
that there is between a person, or a work of art which is
markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much
between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of
admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no
pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in
seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: "Well, I do not admire
this." But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of
Berma's acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying
to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her
acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to
nothing more nor less than admiration.</p>
<p>This genius of which Berma's rendering of the part was only
the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing
more?</p>
<p>I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the
curtain fell on the act from <i>Phèdre</i>, amid enthusiastic
recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside
herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height,
turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face
and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining
the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a
protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed
unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties
which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to
be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as
they were of any existence outside the performance that was being
given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a
classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of
a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the
footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it
as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at
every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience
and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was
prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would
enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that
which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their
first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title
which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed
in the same mellow light, beside those of the author's other
works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her
finest impersonations, next to that of Phèdre. Not that in itself
it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as
sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of
the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the
nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation
of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter
whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for
two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any
character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And
as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad
effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out
great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all
melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one
level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from
one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own,
and Berma's diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm
of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered
complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say
something which is at once similar to and different from the
preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the
variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems
overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodic? But
Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole
speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves,
at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop,
to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making
hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is
about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various
words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts,
captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the
modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to
introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which
were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she
could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of
different sitters, we recognise a painter.</p>
<p>I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be
able to arrest and perpetuate Berma's attitudes, the fine colour
effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight
which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a
single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original
desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet,
the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her
productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it
was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into
others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the
momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the
theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an
attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured
listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another
day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I
admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my
admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I
demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the
morrow, the pleasure that yesterday's impression had refused to
afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun
now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more
profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have
said to one of my schoolfellows: "Certainly, I put Berma first!"
not without a confused feeling that Berma's genius was not,
perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my
preference, or this award to her of a 'first' place, whatever the
peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me.</p>
<p>Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up
at Mme. de Guermantes's box. The Princess was in the act&mdash;by
a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind
pursued into the void&mdash;of turning her head towards the back
of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards
the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed,
with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was,
but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making
every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended
with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an
adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion
tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who
had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made
a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated
in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian
monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to
these demi-gods of the Jockey Club&mdash;who at that moment, and
among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I
should most have liked to be&mdash;the familiar 'good evening' of
an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of
her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the
mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze
which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with
which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to
another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed
its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the
essential quality of the unknown form of life which became
apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his
wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the
whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front
scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his
eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand
which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without
moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were
making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound
bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess
had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was
inclined to make fun for what she called her 'exaggerations' (a
name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and
restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and
enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of
those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as 'dressed
up,' and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste.
Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of
the Princess's head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her
net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a
simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level
eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck
and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against
which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the
bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles
(either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly
brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was
positively British. But different as their two costumes were,
after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she
herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning
to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation.</p>
<p>Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes
when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too
complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would
declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and
marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found
something a little cold, a little austere, a little 'tailor-made'
in her cousin's way of dressing, would discover in this rigid
sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that
existed between them, the universal and pre-established
gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the
contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By
those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their
manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess
was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness
of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned
to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being
performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted
from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing,
which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so
the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see
in two smaller boxes there how an 'arrangement' supposed to
suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the
Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred,
while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to
imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only
made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl,
mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of
raven's feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper
place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with
the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in
the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers
brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which
they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions)
composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels
would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by
attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that
so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm
torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the
explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire.</p>
<p>The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer's presence on this
occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness
as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this
devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an
equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to
be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women
like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest
aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various
charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes
off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the
simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either,
she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion
in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless
the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten
years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might
reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten
by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of
which&mdash;for she prided herself upon her medical
knowledge&mdash;she thought she knew, she was afraid that she
might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in
the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see
in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young
Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d'Argencourt's brother, who moved
impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second
were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of
those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a
chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes
with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet
his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully
curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat,
stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a
blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved,
in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall,
like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in
his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with
Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on
their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in
the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw
about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any
awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If
at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes,
lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds
of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and
followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer's),
M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his
companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the
Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the
well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose
friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient.</p>
<p>Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged
to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de
Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with
which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of
politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this
centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the
same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own
attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of
the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus
to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to
follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the
official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as
composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as
curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she
numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on
other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those
occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive,
conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to
see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying
on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there
still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there
was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth
her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her
carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with
the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking
pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the
high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the
same evening. "Perhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose
to hear Berma," thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the
thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that
ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: "The
Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the
most refined, the choicest society." For myself, who derived from
the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Condé what I imagined to be the
life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so
ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had
their opinion of <i>Phèdre</i> than that of the greatest critic
in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an
intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the
Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion
which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the
nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of
their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the
thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded
that their opinion of <i>Phèdre</i> should yield to me was the
charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering
along the Guermantes way.</p>
<p>Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the
cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their
garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in
which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged
once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Condé, but
rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as
being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body.
The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a
materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their
internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the
Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that
they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which
swept downward from her brow, and her cousin's glittering
spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to
one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone,
the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird
of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is
from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp
that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing
aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far
more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and
lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a
miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the
Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of
mankind, beneath a crimson canopy, in a clear lighted space,
between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief
transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by
the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the
Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could
surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that
she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the
box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective
madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense
that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at
the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there
must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive
current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon,
devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray
illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing
in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in
my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the
balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my
gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the
flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them
ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her
cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered
me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her
smile.</p>
<p>And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would
appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner
of the street along which she generally came, and, when the
moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an
air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way
and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as
though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for
the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I
waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate
opened (letting out one after another so many people who were
none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle
continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took
me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous
actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the
pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous
crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the
streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it
believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard
from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so
stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this
great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her
movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering
a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk&mdash;and
for me there was no one in the world but herself out
walking&mdash;a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest
ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the
third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I
betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the
Duchess's usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I
had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the
weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of
sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if,
suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by
the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a
crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and
gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess
or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my
hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an
unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the
time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I
followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear.
Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which
I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again,
prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my
memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own
ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to
work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter
place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I
had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round
Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so
often sought to evoke from the woods of Méséglise, each one of
whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable
of assuaging.</p>
<p>On coming home from the Opéra-Comique I had added for next
morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been
hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with
her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness
promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her
cousin's box. I would follow the course which Françoise had told
me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same
time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days
earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and
catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the
scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation
it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was
doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the
possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that
have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had
long held and which Albertine's coldness, Gisèle's premature
departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained
separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of
being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her);
next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen
in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to
which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of
the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de
Guermantes at the Opéra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny
star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover
I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to
know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I
possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it
was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in
the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it
passed gradually into a unique and definite
association&mdash;exclusive of every other feminine
form&mdash;with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing
than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered
it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out
exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which
it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first
private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the
first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life,
the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few
hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having
the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been
charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite
freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain,
without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of
love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more
definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater
strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no
longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it
completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the
difference&mdash;never twice, as it happened, the
same&mdash;between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now
every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes
emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her
tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken
hair&mdash;all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on
the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned
my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter
which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the
Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were
red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the
fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with
the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of
the <i>Phèdre</i> evening, acknowledged my salute, which I
addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not
seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the
memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery
of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was
in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord,
generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it
that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though
by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my
thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls
coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet
I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had
come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the
theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its
pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I
should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was
like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture
which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were
the dress and the hat.</p>
<p>Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a
violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically
arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of
the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous
commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without
having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next
feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn
away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on
the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street
and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a
flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian
deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird's beak that I
saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the
toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left
no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain
vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests
rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural
plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on
its surface were piercing-keen and blue.</p>
<p>One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on
end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside
a pastry-cook's shop tucked in between two of the mansions of
this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took
shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed
woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had
had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning
flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the
glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her
and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my
while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way
homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking
absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I
realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a
lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that
this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally
be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled
at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I
had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom
I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her
bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate,
standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose
scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her
a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For
the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the
window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation
which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very
well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his 'day
out' stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying
him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme.
Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied
a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next,
in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to
any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh
and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and
which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without
altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new
collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de
Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all
this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed
me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have
made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a
blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions' losing
their importance for me.</p>
<p>I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was
tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it
indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness,
disapproval and pity which Françoise shewed when she was helping
me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her
for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn
and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence,
for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once
discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my
parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been
able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be
explained by sources of information that were open to her alone:
as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe
several days before the post has brought it to the European
colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but
from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the
particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de
Guermantes's servants had heard their mistress say how tired she
was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went,
and had repeated her remarks to Françoise. My parents might, it
is true, have attached some servant other than Françoise to my
person, still I should have been no better off. Françoise was in
a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling
things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and
narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still
the village maiden whose parents had had 'a place of their own'
but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into
service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the
social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort
of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place
that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local
museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which
the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in
certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated
with the words of Françoise, inspired by a traditional local
sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could
in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread
to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her
mother's deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of
all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had
entered our service she had acquired&mdash;as, obviously, anyone
else coming there in her place would have acquired&mdash;the
ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the
other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged
to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the
fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile
gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives,
feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable
occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that
possibly we too were 'employers' after all. This alteration in
Françoise'» character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of
existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain
characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at
Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a
Pharaoh or a Doge&mdash;and, far more even than his, the life of
his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an
even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can
prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more
intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had
dismissed Françoise, to keep the same servant. For various others
might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with
the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a
rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an
attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as
not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them
effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same
points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my
line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing,
any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely
because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming
spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects
which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own
natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a
sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my
mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her
servants, expressions like 'the lower orders' or 'the servant
class.' But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to
think of replacing Françoise by anyone else was that her
successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race
of servants in general and to the class of my servants in
particular.</p>
<p>To return to Françoise, I never in my life experienced any
humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of
condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the
thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the
contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on
the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the
consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she
knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a
slight movement with her lips as if she still had her mouth full
and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it,
or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed
that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to
others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their
meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I
could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had
professed to love me did not love me than Françoise herself could
have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some
clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped
envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy
for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our
income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to
prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the
head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would
complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting
that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But
she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I
was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given
me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the
later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than
Françoise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made
apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty,
without waiting for words, without even bothering one's head
about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain
invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character
to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have
suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently
occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of
truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of
involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions
(which were at once interpreted by Françoise); I ought perhaps to
have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be
conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and
dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as
with most people; called into being in so immediate, so
contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular
interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my
character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent,
sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When
Françoise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my
permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though
her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and
honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into
indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards
that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to
hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible
way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new
and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with
Françoise so different from that on which I used to like letting
my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of
doubt, Françoise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my
praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world
that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all
reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think
ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and
the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were
apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from
ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs
other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with
equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this
sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world
appalled me. So far it was only Françoise that was revealed, and
of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one's social
relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day
plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future's
secret. For the present only Françoise was concerned. Did she
sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to
embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint
Jupien's girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the
impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of
whether Françoise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who
first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined)
stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his
defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed
on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders
spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow
which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be
no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form
countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his
actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything
but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information&mdash;a
shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal
justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of
love.</p>
<p>I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest
happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He
should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that
ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her
from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would
condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I
imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some
change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the
surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were
recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the
refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of
employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule
escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I
preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with
a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a
whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen
upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me&mdash;me who
had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and
powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine
the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should
welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained
unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman
who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible
number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I
could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as
rich as the richest commoner&mdash;and noble also; without
reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of
fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen.</p>
<p>I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this
way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain,
for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that
abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on
my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have
set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I
could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down
except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so,
for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a
moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow
was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her
displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for
that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I
would then tell Françoise to pack my boxes, and immediately
afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the
desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural
and most positive form of oneself, Françoise, borrowing the
expression from her daughter's vocabulary, used to remark that I
was 'dippy.' She did not approve of this; she said that I was
always 'balancing,' for she made use, when she was not aspiring
to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true
that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to
servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not
suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as 'where there
isn't a will.' I should never have had the heart to leave Paris
except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de
Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not
indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in
the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of
the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever
reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which
might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest
advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de
Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom
she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who
would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her
about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her
know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event,
simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would
be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I
should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form,
spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a
realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the
'Guermantes' that she was&mdash;this was the constant object of
my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect
means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to
whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her
parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a
contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my
contemplation of her every morning in the street?</p>
<p>The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me
seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at
once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to
disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to
ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling
little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to
divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been
disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life.
We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation
in the thought that just because they are never visible she has
perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this
possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown.</p>
<p>Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris,
whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military
duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he
was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on
the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a
pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that
garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his
leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on
the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It
was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings
might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns,
aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over
which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort
of intermittent haze of sound which&mdash;as a screen of poplars
by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one
cannot see&mdash;indicates the movements of a regiment on parade,
so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares
has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration,
musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or
tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely
repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too
far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to
return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed.
As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had
too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather
to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter
from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked
behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking
after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere
at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of
a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants,
has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the
address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might
come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be
staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of
contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find
him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of
stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every
moment, for it was now six o'clock, men were emerging in pairs
into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some
foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily
anchored.</p>
<p>Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass
spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was
eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. "Oh! What a bore!" he
exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the
tips of his ears. "I have just had a week's leave, and I shan't
be off duty again for another week."</p>
<p>And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this
first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time
agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he
broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with
little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of
them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his
eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he
felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important
matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me
now vitally, our friendship.</p>
<p>"I say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can't
recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition
ground, where there's a show just starting; you'll find it
beastly crowded. No, you'd better go to the Hôtel de Flandre; it
is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It
'makes' quite an 'old-world residence.'"</p>
<p>Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word 'makes' for
'has the air of,' because the spoken language, like the written,
feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the
meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as
journalists often have not the least idea from what school of
literature come the 'turns of speech' that they borrow, so the
vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in
imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew
personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly
instilled into him. "Besides," he concluded, "the hotel I mean is
more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You
will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender
advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive
to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that
particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is
for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are
quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there
is something reassuring about that." But to me, less of an artist
than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give
was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my
growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago
at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good
night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at
Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt
of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed
gaze.</p>
<p>"A lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor
fellow; you're quite pale; and here am I like a great brute
talking to you about tapestries which you won't have the heart to
look at, even. I know the room they'll put you in; personally I
find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won't
have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You
mustn't think I don't understand; I don't feel the same myself,
but I can put myself in your place."</p>
<p>At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the
square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding
the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at
such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and,
seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse
at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it
by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my
side.</p>
<p>"Yes," he resumed; "I assure you that I fully understand; I
feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched," he
went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, "when I think
that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been
able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of
your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you
won't want to read if you're feeling like that. And I shan't be
able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I've been off now
twice running because my girl came down to see me."</p>
<p>And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the
effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply
to my disease.</p>
<p>"Run along and light the fire in my quarters," he called to a
trooper who passed us. "Hurry up; get a move on!"</p>
<p>After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and
his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great
friendship.</p>
<p>"No! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so
much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I
must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell
me all about yourself presently. We'll go up to my room; we
mustn't hang about too long on the square, there's the devil of a
draught; I don't feel it now myself, but you aren't accustomed to
it, I'm afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work;
have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your
talent I'm sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It
amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it's the
useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the
ones who could if they wanted to, won't. There, and I've clean
forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are
in safe keeping. I never part from them."</p>
<p>An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and
solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him
and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment
occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he
had flung himself into the action with so much force,
straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute
ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering
all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this
moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing
tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which
he had just made and those on which he was about to embark.
Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm,
benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the
direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste,
raised his hand to the peak of his cap.</p>
<p>"I must just say a word to the Captain," whispered Saint-Loup.
"Be a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It's the
second on the right, on the third floor; I'll be with you in a
minute."</p>
<p>And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which
fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and
stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who,
before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied
nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though
he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First
Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house
which he had taken for the period of his service at Doncières,
and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an
ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de
la République. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping
on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of
barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds
and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup's room. I stood for a moment
outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he
moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room
was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only
the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep
quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I
entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another
smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person
it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the
flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a
fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should
have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his
nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited.
Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century
managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of
the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale
toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined
and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to
be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table,
between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and
that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire
which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an
animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness,
let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into
sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the
chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup's watch, which could not
be far away. This tick changed its place every moment 'for I
could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in
front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away
as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the
watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from
which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it
at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for
sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them
with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning
us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and
natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man
whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the
noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in
Saint-Loup's fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and
cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he
hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight,
at regular intervals, over the Grand'place of Doncières. Let the
sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently
before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god.
The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin,
faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The
withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to
hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to
be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet
delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing,
distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with
the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we
do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that
they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire
to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this
connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to
which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame,
since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with
these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who,
when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease,
stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our
attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give
ourselves as an objective to capture not the 'other person' with
whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that
person's hands.</p>
<p>To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken
the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a
pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune
overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once
the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend
even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad
instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is
abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the
room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of
carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were
expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes
disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday
the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a
continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in
the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like a boring
book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over
our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself
heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound,
mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is
sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man
the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash
the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him,
is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude
of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting
of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty
streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift,
consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom
itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but
the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of
cotton-wool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and
the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the
resonant compass of the outer world.</p>
<p>Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not
temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat
a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to
watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like
that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is
wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be
still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily
climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a
series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the
drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface,
sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying
overboard&mdash;sails which the cutting off of the current, if
the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon
themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to
magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough
in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned
books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he
will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself
an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he
has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the
magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was
not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom
we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a
figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for
those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this
totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty
to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks
now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not
yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes
alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like
the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his
deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement
was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved
also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a
spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become
alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in
the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the
solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service
which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an
increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now
assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as
at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the
building on which the deaf man looks from his window&mdash;be it
barracks, church, or town hall&mdash;is only so much scenery. If
one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust
and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on
the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside
in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy
blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the
chastity of the prevailing silence.</p>
<p>The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little
barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened
and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in.</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,"
I said to him; "how jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine
and sleep here."</p>
<p>And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what
repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by
that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was
maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a
thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a
barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad
bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same
joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of
which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the
town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam;&mdash;a voice sure
of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only
of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness.</p>
<p>"So you'd rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than
to go the hotel by yourself?" Saint-Loup asked me, smiling.</p>
<p>"Oh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it," I
pleaded; "you know it's not possible, and you know how wretched I
shall be over there."</p>
<p>"Good! You flatter me!" he replied. "It occurred to me just
now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is
precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain."</p>
<p>"And he has given you leave?" I cried.</p>
<p>"He hadn't the slightest objection."</p>
<p>"Oh! I adore him!"</p>
<p>"No; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get
hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner," he went
on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears.</p>
<p>We were several times interrupted by one or other of
Saint-Loup's friends' coming in. He drove them all out again.</p>
<p>"Get out of here. Buzz off!"</p>
<p>I begged him to let them stay.</p>
<p>"No, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely
uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop.
Besides, I don't want them here either; they would spoil these
precious moments I've been looking forward to. But you mustn't
think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that
everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We
have a major here who is a splendid chap. He's given us a course
in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a
problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there
is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about
it which you couldn't fail to appreciate."</p>
<p>"That's not the officer who's given me leave to stay here
to-night?"</p>
<p>"No; thank God! The man you 'adore' for so very trifling a
service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the
earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit
inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the
master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he
has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major
I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he's a
freemason and doesn't go to confession. The Prince de Borodino
would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is
pretty fair cheek, when all's said and done, from a man whose
great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a
small farmer himself if it hadn't been for the Napoleonic wars.
Not that he hasn't a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous
position in society, where he's neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly
ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced
awkward, this so-called Prince," added Robert, who, having been
led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories
of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had
unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a
contempt for the nobility of the Empire.</p>
<p>I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought
that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he
might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him
and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very
small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter
more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de
Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some
sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside
me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to
gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that
tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her
passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of
memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare
bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a
high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous
discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to
me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a
text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later
on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little
like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process
which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been
directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common
origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were
pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon's beak,
the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for
the cutting out&mdash;in another copy analogous and slender, with
too delicate a skin&mdash;of Robert's face, which might almost be
superimposed upon his aunt's. I saw in him, with a keen longing,
those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race
which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with
which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the
glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been
the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess
with a bird.</p>
<p>Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my
evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of
comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the
champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of
sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I
ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort
when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar
what he has supposed that form of life to exclude&mdash;the
wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an
exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when
I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup's window, which
being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a
curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour,
the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day
before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already
sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as
it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I
opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the
window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still
in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me
to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers
who were busy with their horses in the square had finished
grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the
meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up
against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of
darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of
frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was
looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit
of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was
there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than
the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought
as of absent&mdash;or dead&mdash;friends, that is to say without
any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even
although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape
outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at
Doncières, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on
the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of
chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup's batman in this comfortable
room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which
to look out at the hill&mdash;the idea of there being anything
else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it,
being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape
of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with
the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist,
without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in
moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as
a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my
impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs
of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of
Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun
began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it
with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might
expose its grizzled rump to the sun's rays, which, an hour later,
when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the
autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters
pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also
and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which
I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy.</p>
<p>But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I
knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was
like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been
exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every
bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present,
my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense
of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less
sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new
place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I
must bring into contact with its environment that 'Self' which I
rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same,
having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at
Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the
edge of an unpacked trunk.</p>
<p>As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I
was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was
that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of
structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which,
released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its
long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding
about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in
their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as
ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being
dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling,
which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the
rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to
offer me their company&mdash;neighbours of a sort, idle but never
noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the
privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of
the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I
came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short,
the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from
day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being
overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this
house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people,
living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged
to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not
to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the
great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth
century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its
hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted
ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to
the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all
round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as
the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken
steps.</p>
<p>If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or
being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase,
no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one
close above another, that there seemed to exist in their
gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which,
in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar,
sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and
downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a
health resort in the Alps to find that the act&mdash;as a rule
not noticed&mdash;of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight.
I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us
only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I
set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before
ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them,
perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they
used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which
I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker
once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double
doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence
in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating
royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought
brass&mdash;of which one would have been wrong to think that its
sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory&mdash;offered
me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to
warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the
hearthrug. The walls held the room in À close embrace, separating
it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what
made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a
place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld
the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in
depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had
hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had
recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if
I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat,
were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing
to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy
the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added
further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still
inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This
closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom
I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell
on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window
opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to
give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above.</p>
<p>Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to
explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long
gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to
offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a
corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue
crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the
phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred
with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations.
When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened
said to me simply "Now you must turn and go back, but, you see,
you are at home here, the house is yours," while the soft carpet,
not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I
could easily come in barefoot, and' the unshuttered windows,
looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would
hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come
in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a
hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped
by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself
there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare
from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I
went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the
pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a
pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go
upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular
state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon
them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that
series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that
first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from
that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been
tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary
current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed,
the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the
position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient
to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new
thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our
perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in
our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing
we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the
dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt.
We awake, look at our watch, see 'four o'clock'; it is only four
o'clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has
gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by
us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of
some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor's orb of
gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my
grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our
walk along the Méséglise way, I was awakened by the blare of a
regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on
several occasions&mdash;and I mention these because one cannot
properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the
sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round
it as a promontory is encircled by the sea&mdash;the intervening
layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music
and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a
moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept,
my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local
anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt
only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was
touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which
caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after
this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music
it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished
passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling
clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its
springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with
sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard
the band, I was no longer certain that the sound of its brasses
had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day
echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the
town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear
of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not
seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still
asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that
the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I
was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with
tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various
scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of
looking on.</p>
<p>What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out,
sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one's dreams, that is
to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following
another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same
story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said,
the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different
that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of
all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately,
for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds
thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their
eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute
has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal
contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of
this, and the brief 'absence' to which it points, indicate that
the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able,
presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance
to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which
will mean their having a more or less 'good' night. But already a
great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real,
when we reach the cave in which 'auto-suggestions'
prepare&mdash;like witches&mdash;the hell-broth of imaginary
maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for
the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our
unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep
cease.</p>
<p>Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange
flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the
sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the
sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals
remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come
and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the
aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered
being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open
windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons
learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the
moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the
resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has
so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with
the warning: "It is seven o'clock," she will find us awake and
ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our
dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the
sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at
times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily
resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our
dreams, but so overshadowed that often we catch sight of them for
the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the
ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of
them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so
distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but
hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly
decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling
into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them
back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate
is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of
substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that,
to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden
morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried.
Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors
foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia,
whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from
the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic
picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn
meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not
preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a
little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and,
covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather
sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this
picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of
which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at
once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory
of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a
number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc
presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides
with what we shall see with opened eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers
into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad
to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that
has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant
Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is
doubled while we sleep.</p>
<p>That kind of sleep is called 'sleeping like lead,' and it
seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few
moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One
is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one's mind, one's
personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one
recover one's own self rather than any other? Why, when one
begins again to think, is it not another personality than
yesterday's that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can
dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings
any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight
that unerringly one lays one's hand? What is it that guides us,
when there has been an actual interruption&mdash;whether it be
that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely
different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when
the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the
tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it
only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories
cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now
become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening&mdash;after
that healing attack of mental alienation which is
sleep&mdash;must after all be similar to what occurs when we
recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And
perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be
conceived as a phenomenon of memory.</p>
<p>When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit
sky&mdash;but discouraged by the chill&mdash;of those last autumn
mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get
up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now
only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been
left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the
pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden
beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change
I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single
environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient,
without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth
and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted,
and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink
and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means
the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned
and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have
given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a
material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a
pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a
paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black
and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some
difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in
striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict
but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs
of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in
the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world
which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen
which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the
house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On
certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother
again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the
memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in
Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again
it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to
become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from
sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a
moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the
hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to
Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially
possible&mdash;I knew that it was extremely difficult for
him&mdash;I should be most grateful if he would look in for a
minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the
door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if
they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my
attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who
would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already
he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before
dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere
very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted
myself by appropriate reactions.</p>
<p>"I hope you weren't angry with me for bothering you; there is
something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed."</p>
<p>"Not at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I
thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have
sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What
can I do to help?"</p>
<p>He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but
before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own
likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him
so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I
had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to
him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to
open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and
gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a
grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares
resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to
dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was
flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for
action.</p>
<p>"What are you doing now?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"I must leave you, I'm afraid; we're going on a route march in
three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade."</p>
<p>"Then it's been a great bother to you, coming here?"</p>
<p>"No, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he
told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you
understand, I don't like to seem to be abusing the
privilege."</p>
<p>"But if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the
place where you'll be training, it would interest me immensely,
and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't advise you to do that; you have been lying awake,
racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of
the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry
you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you
will find an excellent antidote to the demineralisation of your
nerve-cells; only you mustn't go to sleep too soon, because our
band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as
they've passed I think you'll be left in peace, and we shall meet
again this evening, at dinner."</p>
<p>But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being
trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in
the military theories which Saint-Loup's friends used to expound
over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of
my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a
person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in
the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the cafés in
which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra.
To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously
long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep
made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning
I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec,
after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at
Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the
moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of
incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by
the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of
muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength;
life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I
had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on
the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes
walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that
we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we
used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous
pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success.
The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in
ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where
the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion
followed by a good night's rest. Good nights, to make us descend
into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion
from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward
monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively
the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we
discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their
twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in
which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in
order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it.
What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a
mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city,
excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain
impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more
effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a
flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more
unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations.</p>
<p>Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any
opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for
several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel!
As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands
of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the 'romances'
beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep
that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more
than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I
reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of
sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose.
These thoughts carried me far.</p>
<p>On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to
stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was
a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from
either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew
almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings
erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled
incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for
Robert&mdash;he being engaged on some duty or other&mdash;outside
the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his
friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came
now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking
down from the window three hundred feet to the country below,
bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked
with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of
green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I
could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a
popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging
to other squadrons, sons of rich business or professional men who
looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and
without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they
naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup's character
was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to
the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass
to Paris, they had seen supping in the Café de la Paix with the
Duc d'Uzès and the Prince d'Orléans. And on that account, into
his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting
officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation
shewn in the cut of his service dress&mdash;the caps always too
high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a
shade&mdash;they had introduced the idea of a 'tone' which, they
were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the
regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted
for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in
comparison, too pompous and almost common.</p>
<p>One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. "He
can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday
morning in the Allée des Acacias; now he's got some style on a
horse!" replied his companion, and knew what he was talking
about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it
does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet,
thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in
its experience of all those refinements of life which money can
procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of
clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more
impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so
delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to
these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating
oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant
Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on
Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in
Robert's squadron, and to whom he had said how d'ye do 'most
civilly,' while another, who was not in the same squadron, was
quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised
him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared
in the speaker's direction.</p>
<p>"Yes, my brother saw him at the Paix," said another, who had
been spending the day with his mistress; "my brother says his
dress coat was cut too loose and didn't fit him."</p>
<p>"What was the waistcoat like?"</p>
<p>"He wasn't wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort
of palms on it; stunning!"</p>
<p>To the 'old soldiers' (sons of the soil who had never heard of
the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of
ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all
those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style,
whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were
generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the
breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them
nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as
much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities
the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all
time to this most popular of the 'stripes' in the regiment,
manners like no one's else, scornful indifference to what his
superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural
corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of
coffee in the canteen, the afternoon 'lay-down' in the
barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier
fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a
cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade.</p>
<p>"It was the height of my pack."</p>
<p>"Come off it, old chap, you don't expect us to believe that;
it couldn't have been the height of your pack," interrupted a
young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not
to appear a 'learned beggar,' and by venturing on this
contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of
which enchanted him.</p>
<p>"Oh, so it wasn't the height of my pack, wasn't it? You
measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at
it as if he'd have liked to put him in clink. But you needn't
think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he
came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that
blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We'll see what
the 'Capstan' has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he'll say
nothing, but you may be sure he won't be pleased. But there's
nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he's got thirty of
'em and more at home, at his house in town."</p>
<p>"Where did you hear that, old man? From our blasted
corporal-dog?" asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying
the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and
with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation.</p>
<p>"Where did I hear it? From his batman; what d'you think?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Now you're talking. That's a chap who knows when he's
well off!"</p>
<p>"I should say so! He's got more in his pocket than I have,
certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and
everything. He wasn't getting his grub properly, he says. Along
comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: 'I want him to be
properly fed, d'you hear,' he says, 'and I don't care what it
costs.'"</p>
<p>The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted
by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker
which had an immense success.</p>
<p>On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to
fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine
with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had
established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had
set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read.
In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets
of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of
the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of
the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality
coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part
could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the
pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels
the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a
ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to
turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play,
uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some
necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the
hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in
which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps
headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded
globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight
outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from
which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as
would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress
of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my
fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my
hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the
sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for
pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my
room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It
gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a
rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the
coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had
scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a
piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round
table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in
readiness for me, with one of Bergotte's novels, that ever since
then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched
with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able
to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them
again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left
and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like
a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of
the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with
a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those
barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side
furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various
buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped
would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of
a welcome.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine
with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to
go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third
day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen,
an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I
ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to
think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw
nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert's garrison. But a
memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they
remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that
they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things.
And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what
streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply
means of communication between one part and another. The life led
by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me,
be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some
dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in
the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious
scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the
fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a
chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung
over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that
a magician's wand was making them emerge from the night, like a
transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true
lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested
passer-by whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a
candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow
over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling
against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of
leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which
were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the
patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of
the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck
rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I
lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the
shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and
women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after
nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill
the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and
glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long
unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the
dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road
to Méséglise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it
seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy
it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt,
the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible
for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted
to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant
for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising
and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me
not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that
was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a
common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the
wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval
atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I
thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme.
de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and
for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute
quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted
words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers
staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the
direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to
wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense
that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength
sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did
appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far
behind. Whether the intersection of side-streets, the
interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about
this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a
sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been
as far wrong over direction as over distance.</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming
snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the
little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer,
without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of
the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their
faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little
town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed
to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which
Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants.</p>
<p>And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup
and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted
a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried
across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in
which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting,
lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the
'everlasting fire,' an influx (worthy of some <i>Numbering of the
People Before Bethlehem</i> such as the old Flemish masters used
to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking
the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the
look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town)
whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried
past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the
big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to
the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of
some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity
and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by
the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought
in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who
slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on
the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but
where&mdash;for most of the people had nearly finished dinner
when I arrived&mdash;they accumulated untouched, as though their
profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not
so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the
sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly
illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an
aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the
solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the
assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at
the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him,
who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in
which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among
the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep
the late comers' plates from growing cold (which did not,
however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from
being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin,
sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of
crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot
iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went
straight&mdash;at the risk of being knocked down by his
colleagues&mdash;towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I
recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these
sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the
blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression,
already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the
others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view
probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened
by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and
seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a
fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any
instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates,
while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the
boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless
fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their
bodies like the wings in 'primitive' paintings, with pointed
ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of
palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a
distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I
explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup's table
was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him
regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the
young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends,
and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they
were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it
were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On
the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew
Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so
that they should not hear me, said to him:</p>
<p>"Robert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am
going to say, but I shan't be a second. I keep on forgetting to
ask you when I'm in the barracks; isn't that Mme. de Guermantes's
photograph that you have on your table?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes; my good aunt."</p>
<p>"Of course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that
she was; I'd forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your
friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they're
looking at us; another time will do; it isn't at all
important."</p>
<p>"That's all right; go on as long as you like. They can
wait."</p>
<p>"No, no; I do want to be polite to them; they're so nice;
besides, it doesn't really matter in the least, I assure
you."</p>
<p>"Do you know that worthy Oriane, then?"</p>
<p>This 'worthy Oriane,' as he might have said, 'that good
Oriane,' did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de
Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words 'good,'
'excellent,' 'worthy' are mere reinforcements of the
demonstrative 'that,' indicating a person who is known to both
parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say
to someone outside the intimate circle. The word 'good' does duty
as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until
the speaker has hit upon "Do you see much of her?" or "I haven't
set eyes on her for months," or "I shall be seeing her on
Tuesday," or "She must be getting on, now, you know."</p>
<p>"I can't tell you how funny it is that it should be her
photograph, because we're living in her house now, in Paris, and
I've been hearing the most astounding things" (I should have been
hard put to it to say what) "about her, which have made me
immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view,
don't you know, from a&mdash;how shall I put it&mdash;from a
Balzacian point of view; but you're so clever you can see what I
mean; I don't need to explain things to you; but we must hurry
up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?"</p>
<p>"They will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you
are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you
are."</p>
<p>"You are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I
suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn't any idea that I know you, has
she?"</p>
<p>"I can't say; I haven't seen her since the summer, because I
haven't had any leave since she's been in town."</p>
<p>"What I was going to say is this: I've been told that she
looks on me as an absolute idiot."</p>
<p>"That I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but
all the same she's by no means stupid."</p>
<p>"You know that, as a rule, I don't care about your advertising
the good opinion you're kind enough to hold of me; I'm not
conceited. That's why I'm sorry you should have said flattering
things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in
two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could
let her know&mdash;if you would even exaggerate a
trifle&mdash;what you think of me, you would give me great
pleasure."</p>
<p>"Why, of course I will, if that's all you want me to do; it's
not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to
you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a
joke, really; anyhow, if that's all you want we can discuss it in
front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I'm afraid of
your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it's so
inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being
alone together."</p>
<p>It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage
to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a
pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent
form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the
falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his
connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to
frame&mdash;with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de
Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so
forth&mdash;questions which would have been all the more
disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer
them.</p>
<p>"Robert, I'm surprised that a man of your intelligence should
fail to understand that one doesn't discuss the things that will
give one's friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to
ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to
do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn't want any
explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have
no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I
ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de
Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it."</p>
<p>"Not only should I have done it, I will do it."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Next time I'm in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect."</p>
<p>"We shall see; I dare say she won't want to see me, though. I
can't tell you how grateful I am."</p>
<p>"Not at all; it's nothing."</p>
<p>"Don't say that; it's everything in the world, because now I
can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do
is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really
keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference;
you say you will do it, and there you shew the fineness of your
mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a
discussion."</p>
<p>Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I
wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere,
the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to
which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that
seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went
on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of
affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme.
de Guermantes's very features which nature had made in producing
her nephew Robert: "But, I say, we mustn't keep them waiting any
longer, and I've mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to
ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me,
but I'm afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we
were to call each other <i>tu</i>?"</p>
<p>"Bore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of
happiness!"</p>
<p>"Thank you&mdash;<i>tu</i> I mean; you begin first&mdash;ever
so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn't do anything
about Mme. de Guermantes if you'd rather not, this is quite
enough for me."</p>
<p>"I can do both."</p>
<p>"I say, Robert! Listen to me a minute," I said to him later
while we were at dinner. "Oh, it's really too absurd the way our
conversation is always being interrupted, I can't think
why&mdash;you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just
now."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You're quite sure you know who' I mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, what do you take me for, a village idiot?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't care to give me her photograph, I suppose?"</p>
<p>I had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the
time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was
indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question
more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite
natural.</p>
<p>"No; I should have to ask her permission first," was his
answer.</p>
<p>He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation
in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would
give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of
certain moral principles, and for this I hated him.</p>
<p>At the same time I was touched to see how differently
Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with
him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased
affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was
deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous
and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my
absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together
by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly
suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that
pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same
remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it,
he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they
produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an
effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The
mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing
in her attention to her daughter's responses and to the attitude
of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my
company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the
others might not have seen the point, and put in a "What's that?"
to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and
turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically,
by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their
laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that
he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So
that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a
person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a
mirror.</p>
<p>It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly
amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once,
remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had
tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had
interrupted me with: "You told me that before, at Balbec." I was
surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and
assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would
amuse him immensely. "You've forgotten it for the moment," I said
to him, "but you'll remember as I go on." "No, really; I swear
you're mistaken. You've never told me. Do go on." And throughout
the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on
myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished,
amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story
would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for
this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the
stuff of friendship.</p>
<p>On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not
had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great
length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had
been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost
all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the
table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the
sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between
man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical
attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of
such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that
feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused
with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any
material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of
the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory
gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile.
And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this
sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had
budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little
room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about
Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle.
d'Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but
there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never
seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had
happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of
this coming event, they would promptly have announced the
betrothal of Mlle. d'Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup
and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d'Ambresac.
I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their
incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this
little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching
the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has
furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their
credulity is long.</p>
<p>Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was
present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just
then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the
retrial of Dreyfus.</p>
<p>Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been
trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical
work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his
club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought
at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch
formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him,
because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as
himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his
aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as
different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction
as a native of a distant country) had a 'mentality,' as people
were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of
Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the
traditions of his family and the interests of his career could
retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup's cousins
had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry
quite as fine as Victor Hugo's or Alfred de Vigny's, and in spite
of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what
one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess
immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the
privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or
rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the
impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the
type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo.</p>
<p>"That fellow? Oh, he's not like Saint-Loup, he's a regular
devil," my new friend informed me; "he's not even straight about
it. At first, he used to say: 'Just wait a little, there's a man
I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de
Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his
decision.' But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced
Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff
prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although
there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus
business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that
now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the
hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend
coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man
of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier
pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account
for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General
Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and
I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist
as clerical, or at least he was; I don't know what to think of
him now). His family are all broken-hearted at seeing him
possessed by such ideas."</p>
<p>"Don't you think," I suggested, turning half towards
Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him,
as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three
join in the conversation, "that the influence we ascribe to
environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One
is the man of one's idea. There are far fewer ideas than men,
therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is
nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only
materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to
alter it."</p>
<p>At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another
of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and,
pointing to me, exclaimed: "Duroc! Duroc all over!" I had no idea
what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young
face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the
approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he
insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra
with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has
made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance:
"Gibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are
speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards." And to me:
"Please go on."</p>
<p>I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was
going to make me begin all over again.</p>
<p>"And as an idea," I went on, "is a thing that cannot
participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving
any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are
not influenced by material considerations."</p>
<p>When I had finished, "That's one in the eye for you, my boys,"
exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze
with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a
tight-rope. "What were you going to say, Gibergue?"</p>
<p>"I was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major
Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking."</p>
<p>"Why, I've often thought so myself," replied Saint-Loup; "they
have several points in common, but you'll find there are a
thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn't got."</p>
<p>Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an
ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he
felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme
volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse
that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: "You're
the cleverest man I know, do you hear?" He corrected himself, and
added: "You and Elstir.&mdash;You don't mind my bracketing him
with you, I hope. You understand&mdash;punctiliousness. It's like
this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: 'You are
the greatest novelist of the century&mdash;you and Stendhal.'
Excessive punctiliousness, don't you know, and at heart an
immense admiration. No? You don't admit Stendhal?" he went on,
with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found
expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of
interrogation from his green eyes. "Oh, good! I see you're on my
side; Bloch can't stand Stendhal. I think it's idiotic of him.
The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don't you think? I
am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in the
<i>Chartreuse</i>, answer me?" he appealed to me with a boyish
impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the
question almost terrifying. "Mosca? Fabrice?" I answered timidly
that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals
of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was
going on to explain: "But Mosca is far more intelligent, not so
pedantic," I heard Robert cry: "Bravo!" actually clapping his
hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: "Oh, perfect!
Admirable! You really are astounding."</p>
<p>I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as
for that matter to all Robert's friends and to Robert himself,
about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army
in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we
see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which
we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that
formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of
which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot
compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality
of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various
personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the
square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then,
when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked
to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired,
and about the course of military history which would have
appealed to me "even from an aesthetic point of view." I knew
that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle
hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable
ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from
the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at
this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it,
since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others
were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my
other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be
somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded
as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the
current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental
orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard,
my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall
certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his
doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for
Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of
Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are
all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float
around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel
having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the
Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and
contempt the like of which had never been known before. However
this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of
going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour
had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him&mdash;in the
tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her
parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly
admire the generosity of certain Israelites&mdash;that their
colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism&mdash;to a certain
kind of Dreyfusism, at least&mdash;the fanatical, narrow opponent
that he had been made out to be.</p>
<p>"I am not surprised," was Saint-Loup's comment; "for he's a
sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the
prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,"
he turned to me, "Major Duroc, the lecturer on military history I
was telling you about; there's a man who is whole-heartedly in
support of our views, or so I'm told. And I should have been
surprised to hear that he wasn't, for he's not only a brilliantly
clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason."</p>
<p>Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions
of Saint-Loup's faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also
because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my
neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of
military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. "It is
absolutely true."</p>
<p>"But what do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Well, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a
military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial
happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be
analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a
palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as
any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is
satisfying to the mind."</p>
<p>"Give me an example or two, if you don't mind."</p>
<p>"It is not very easy to explain," Saint-Loup broke in. "You
read, let us say, that this or that Corps has
tried.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. but before we go any further,
the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not
without their significance. If it is not the first time that the
operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we
find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign
that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered
heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer
in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must
ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if
it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks,
a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of
succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not
at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a
composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps,
which throws a light on the strength of the forces the
belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the
moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the
enemy's, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is
about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer
in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will
only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate
destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has
facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a
much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several
important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the
operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of
the position which the defending force has been holding, simply
to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if
a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable
highly important forces on the other side. You can understand
that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides,
there are all these points of importance, the study of the
position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands,
of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very
highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical
context," he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted
with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months
afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. "While
the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if
you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the
neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of
the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side
was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the
other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of
activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that
point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check
there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked
you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an
increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which
was a classic feint in Napoleon's wars.) On the other hand, to
appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object,
and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be
accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so
much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be
intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the
manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We
are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army
has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that
are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule
lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank
attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command
makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was
merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth
will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued
from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations
governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their
habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with
their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must
not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant,
which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the
enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have
been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic
plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military
history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader
becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is
for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is
wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through
the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a
headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not
enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one
must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands,
what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations,
apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in
the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the
plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience,
the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy
(whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am
not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call
it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A
battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the
centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has
been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it
combined certain conditions of geographical position, of
geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would
obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in
two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has
been it will continue to be. A painter doesn't make a studio out
of any old room; so you don't make a battle-field out of any old
piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But,
once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the
type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing,
a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi,
Leipzig, Cannae. I can't say whether there is ever going to be
another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a
war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and
deliberately, on the commander's part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a
Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that
Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a
Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning
their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both
flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the
oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae.
Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one
thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I
introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very
great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack
of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his
sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice
he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale.
The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that's a thing
that will crop up if there's ever another war. It's no more
obsolete than the <i>Iliad</i>. I must add that we are
practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can't
afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume
the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me
is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us
opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my
masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave
room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very
easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where
the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory."</p>
<p>The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy.
They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in
my life at Doncières, with regard to these officers whom I used
to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which
bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying
power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes
while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island,
the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler,
Legrandin's brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to
appear non-existent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not,
perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened
hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not,
perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and
fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for
everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he
had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an
intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of
attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any
attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left
Doncières I should continue to take an interest in the work of my
friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them
another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that
this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the
word:</p>
<p>"You interest me&mdash;I beg your pardon, <i>tu</i> interest
me enormously," I said to Saint-Loup, "but tell me, there is one
point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by
the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is
not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules
is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied.
I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing
beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can't tell
you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the
commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply
the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as
there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two
states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye,
nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps
on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case
they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one
case it is better to operate, in another to wait?"</p>
<p>"I should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking
when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure
divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz,
or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find
certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon's movements
and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a
dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation
of what the enemy <i>may</i> do, what he actually does is only a
symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of
them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks
only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases
all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide
whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not
the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his
divination&mdash;like Mme. de Thèbes (you follow me?)&mdash;which
decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I've
been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a
reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen
other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going
to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at
another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing
the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring
up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different
place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the
forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his
hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense
number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that
is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it
out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a
better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go
through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you
that these simple classic movements which we study here, and
which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for
the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal&mdash;no, I know you're
not well, I apologise!&mdash;well, in a war, when you feel behind
you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher
Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of
a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the
spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may
have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the
literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the
direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow,
so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of
the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain
extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general
has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a
system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the
inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you
can forecast the line of an army on the march."</p>
<p>"Now you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that
power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his
plan, which you allowed me a moment ago."</p>
<p>"Not at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read
together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities
compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again
with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four
plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to
choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which
the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and
greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty.
For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons
(such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be
pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage
of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less
perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and
has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He
may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy,
uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies
beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what
I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the
second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has
tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness)
merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him
later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus
at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west,
was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly
safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And
Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will
see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from
which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some
extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room
for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it
doesn't much matter, really, because these conditions are after
all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the
rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it
more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician
Poincaré is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly
accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you,
they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are
altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to
go by the <i>Field Service</i> of 1895, which, you may say, is
out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine
which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral
effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy.
Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains
in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you
about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will
be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons
will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer
will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but
materially."</p>
<p>"Saint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next
<i>Field Service</i> will shew signs of this evolution," put in
my other neighbour.</p>
<p>"I am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem
to make more impression upon my friend than mine," said
Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction
between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he
thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official
confirmation. "Perhaps I may have underestimated the importance
of the rules; I don't know. They do change, that must be
admitted. But in the meantime they control the military
situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they
reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal
cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you," he
remarked to me. "After all, you may say that what does most to
accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In
the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one
belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the
successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who
will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past.
With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future,
if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before
we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice,
peace will have been signed."</p>
<p>"Don't be so touchy," I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the
first words of this speech. "I was listening to you quite
eagerly."</p>
<p>"If you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me
to speak," his friend went on, "I shall add to what you have just
been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it
is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen
that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to
appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon
his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain
units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in
the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in
some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as
interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian
Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Fr&oelig;schviller and
Wissembourg."</p>
<p>"Ah! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has
brains," was Saint-Loup's comment.</p>
<p>I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when,
beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the
general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what
interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted,
what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked
genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would
take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according
to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon
more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I
asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by
name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader,
the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends,
who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer
me with an inexhaustible good nature.</p>
<p>I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing
night which extended far around us and in which we heard from
time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen
the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour
which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these
young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also
from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme.
de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of
his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater
solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the
savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They
gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite;
sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been
taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which
lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the
yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them,
inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at
different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of
rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on
other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these
original properties of our food, which he presented in its
natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine
was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood
out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still
contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water,
surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells,
crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part
of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy.</p>
<p>"I am jealous, furious," Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling,
half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside
which I had been having with his friend. "Is it because you find
him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me?
Well, I suppose he's everything now, and no one else is to have a
look in!" Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live
in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on
which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never
venture.</p>
<p>When the conversation became general, they avoided any
reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The
following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a
curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere,
he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. "The
reason is," I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, "that
the influence of environment is not so important as people
think.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." I intended of course to stop at
this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had
made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had
repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse
myself by adding: "As, in fact, I was saying the other
day.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." But I had reckoned without the
reverse side of Robert's polite admiration of myself and certain
other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so
entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a
day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas
were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory,
Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in
his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his
preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with
warm approval.</p>
<p>"Why, yes; environment is of no importance."</p>
<p>And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my
interrupting, or failing to understand him:</p>
<p>"The real influence is that of one's intellectual environment!
One is the man of one's idea!"</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who
has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with
a gimlet-like stare:</p>
<p>"All men with similar ideas are alike," he informed me, with a
challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I
myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the
other hand he remembered so well.</p>
<p>I did not arrive at Saint-Loup's restaurant every evening in
the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us
are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware
of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a
long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town
on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de
Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said
that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist,
taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering,
by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the
wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort
in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted
for one's entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they,
one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in
terms to be obliged to <i>think</i> a part of one's body. Only it
seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze
we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look
up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: "Perhaps
she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for
all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me:
'Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet
you; she is coming down here.'" It was not in the firmament alone
that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing
breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a
message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields
of Méséglise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling
with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that
feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these
feelings for particular people, there is always something in us
that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say,
to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of
humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us
are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a
certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny
fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I
recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte's account, or
else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any
room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the
agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her
absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the
mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes
was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a
diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts,
which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the
practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it
springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us
so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even
to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its
being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to
myself: "A fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de
Guermantes." A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an
interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned,
reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and
the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that
assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the
loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I
felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was
borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was
continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable
equilibrium. One day I said to myself: "Perhaps there will be a
letter to-night;" and on entering the dining-room I found courage
to ask Saint-Loup:</p>
<p>"You don't happen to have had any news from Paris?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied gloomily; "bad news."</p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only
he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But
I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent
Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt.</p>
<p>I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his
mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down
to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even
when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always
seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of
violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for
reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut
themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse
to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our
patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that
Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an
understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false
impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only
picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him
with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his
energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before
the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a
thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him
something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he
began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and
accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his
own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it
up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word
from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would
perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain
thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was
coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking
advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a
few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be
already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of
nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to
such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she
might not be in hiding at Doncières, or have sailed for the
Indies.</p>
<p>It has been said that silence is a force; in another and
widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of
those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who
has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as
what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so
insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is
a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to
it in a prison cell. But what a torture&mdash;keener than that of
having to keep silence&mdash;to have to endure the silence of the
person one loves! Robert asked himself: "What can she be doing,
never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps,
and will always go on hating me." And he reproached himself. Thus
her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse.
Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of
silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit,
but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere
through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the
abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible
illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent
love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of
indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt
relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period
of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected
letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every
sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: "The letter!
The letter!" After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection,
he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a
silence without end.</p>
<p>He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all
the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he
fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put
all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad
which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they
will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the
time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of
a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest
of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return
gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that
one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death.
And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the
one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and
is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren
rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint
he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But
his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with
the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced
himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that
it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than
with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in
which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from
her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in
the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He
contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently
been installed at Doncières, and asking for news from, or giving
instructions to a lady's maid whom he had procured and placed
with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out,
complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by
what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of
the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her
dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant
din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another
moment, Robert's mistress had now taken a little house in the
neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Doncières, no
longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by
exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to
talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening,
said: "I hear her; you shan't.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. you
shan't.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." He awoke. He had
been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country
with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from
a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the
serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich
and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for
his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard
the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit
of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force
the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And
the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with
an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest
which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget.</p>
<p>"It was an idiotic dream," he concluded, still quite
breathless.</p>
<p>All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed,
he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress
to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone
for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been
of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite
proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument
installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his
mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His
bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent
stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced
in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid
sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood
asking himself what decision his friend was going to take.</p>
<p>At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive
her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been
avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation.
Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had
almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have,
in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to
be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he
hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to
recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of
doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to
recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now
he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the
other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with
him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for
leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt,
which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at
Easter."</p>
<p>"We shan't be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because
I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn't matter in
the least, I assure you."</p>
<p>"To Balbec? But you didn't go there till August."</p>
<p>"I know; but next year they're making me go there earlier, for
my health."</p>
<p>All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of
his mistress, after what he had told me. "She is violent simply
because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she
is a sublime creature. You can't imagine what exquisite poetry
there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls' Day at
Bruges. 'Nice' of her, don't you think? If you ever do meet her
you'll see what I mean; she has a
greatness.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." And, as he was
infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary
circles in which the lady moved: "There is something sidereal
about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the
poet merging into the priest."</p>
<p>I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would
enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to
wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by
the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the
famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext
behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on
my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been
that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things
better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country
town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have
commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had
not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not
so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it
might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was
the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that
aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to
look at other pictures by Elstir.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were
something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater
painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose
frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly
collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him
and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only
recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life,
and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen
photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for
long under the influence of Japanese art.</p>
<p>Several of the works most characteristic of his various
manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at
les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes,
seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there
and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose
millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and
towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who,
inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an
astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world
which Elstir's pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for
many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive
sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those
who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works
by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles
as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all,
quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me
of his lady's projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during
dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the
spur of the moment:</p>
<p>"Listen, if you don't mind. Just one last word on the subject
of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the
painter I met at Balbec?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course I do."</p>
<p>"You remember how much I admired his work?"</p>
<p>"I do, quite well; and the letter we sent him."</p>
<p>"Very well, one of the reasons&mdash;not one of the chief
reasons, a subordinate reason&mdash;why I should like to meet the
said lady&mdash;you do know who' I mean, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. How involved you're getting."</p>
<p>"Is that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least,
by Elstir."</p>
<p>"I say, I never knew that."</p>
<p>"Elstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he
stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should
very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I
don't know whether you're on sufficiently intimate terms with
your aunt: but couldn't you manage, somehow, to give her so good
an impression of me that she won't refuse, and then ask her if
she'll let me come and see the picture without you, since you
won't be there?"</p>
<p>"That's all right. I'll answer for her; I'll make a special
point of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you."</p>
<p>"It's very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally
nice if you were to call me <i>tu</i>, as you promised, and as
you began to do."</p>
<p>"I hope it's not your departure that you two are plotting
together," one of Robert's friends said to me. "You know, if
Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn't make any difference, we
shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps,
but we'll do all we can to make you forget his absence." As a
matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert's mistress
would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain
de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given
authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to
Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud
of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the
principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy
under Napoleon III's barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best
of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of
majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the
hairdresser, through whose books the Prince's account had been
running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less
by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and
strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting
and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always
paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses.
Having learned of Saint-Loup's vexation at not being able to go
with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince
at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his
head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat
menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man's gallant
adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish
indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid
bill, but the barber's recommendation tended to put him in as
good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad.
While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was
promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the
hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his
own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing
an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure
fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to
Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast,
but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no
scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the
matter to Robert again.</p>
<p>All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at
Doncières, or if I should come there again at any time, even
although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their
time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the
greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and
youth and strength at the service of my weakness.</p>
<p>"Why on earth," they went on, after insisting that I should
stay, "don't you come down here every year; you see how our quiet
life appeals to you! Besides you're so keen about everything that
goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier."</p>
<p>For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the
different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of
admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my
schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of
the Théâtre-Français. If, in the place of one of the generals
whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such
as Galliffet or Négrier, one of Saint-Loup's friends, with a
contemptuous: "But Négrier is one of the feeblest of our general
officers," put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin
de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when
the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the
sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. "Better even
than Négrier? But in what respect; give me an example?" I should
have liked there to exist profound differences even among the
junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for
these differences to seize the essential quality of what
constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been
most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I
had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither
Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine
officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of
efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in
the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and
freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in
comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to
include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from
whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his
attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of
the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his
influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the
houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have
looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any
bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry
serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his
official relations (which, for that matter, were always
excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose
grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the
Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by
marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III
and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d'Etat, felt that in
spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and
the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at
things from the same point of view as they, counted for very
little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself
was&mdash;he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern&mdash;not a true
noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he
regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been
confirmed by the Emperor&mdash;one of what were known in the
Faubourg Saint-Germain as 'touched-up' Counts&mdash;and who had
besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a
long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince
de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters
'Monseigneur' and was a nephew of the Sovereign.</p>
<p>Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de
Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I,
whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on
Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain's placid countenance, one
caught a trace of Napoleon I&mdash;if not in his natural
features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask&mdash;the
officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in
his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of
Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having
asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and
having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been
brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who
was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the
likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave
him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else,
had just been refused.</p>
<p>If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures
to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg
Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he
frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were
pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all
from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these
two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted
of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was
delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of
a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought
themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And
so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of
Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man
had been recommended by Marshal X&mdash;&mdash;, confined himself
to being obliging with regard to the military duties which
Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but
never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he
found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as
this occurred during my stay at Doncières, he asked him to bring
me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched
Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain's table, in distinguishing, in
their respective manners and refinements, the difference that
existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that
of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even
if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had
been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to
exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more
now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular
course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or
fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on
meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old
nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered
by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its
tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be
introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the
stranger's name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him
(crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself
back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one
foot in the palm of his hand) call him 'my dear fellow.'
Belonging on the other hand to a nobility whose titles still
preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders
still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for
glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices
in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to
deal with men, the Prince de Borodino&mdash;not perhaps very
distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but
at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and
behaviour generally&mdash;regarded his own rank as a prerogative
that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup
would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he
addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct
with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came
naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine
kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no
doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies,
and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest
posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table,
the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there;
but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less
upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible
source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and
his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a
Fould.</p>
<p>Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing
more important to do than to command a squadron, the
preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not,
for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in
any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit
of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead,
the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were
materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face
reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first
Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy
melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a
cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of
Doncières, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the
brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of
cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into
the serjeant-major's office, followed by the adjutant and the
quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Masséna. When he chose
the cloth for his squadron's breeches, he fastened on the
master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving
Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would
stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his
moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a
new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to
Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not
properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men's rations.
And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle
class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons)
that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue
Sèvres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father
by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace
house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those
rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in
the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been
converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other
gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners,
which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post
abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation
to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his
easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an
enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the
mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in
treating of the social relations with the middle classes which
the Prince had at Doncières, it may be as well to add these few
words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the
senior medical officer's wife sang like a Conservatoire
medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel
and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They
were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went
to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtalès, and the
Murats, and people like that. "But," they said to themselves,
"he's just a captain, after all; he's only too glad to get us to
come. Still, he's a real friend, you know." But when M. de
Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure
an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais,
he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical
couples as he forgot the Doncières theatre and the little
restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon,
and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel
nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his
table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of
their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had
written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the
suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between
Paris and Doncières, she might make use of it to speak to me. In
short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me
to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The
telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is
to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their
mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not
having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that
it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to
lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid
enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery
for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible
but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak,
and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which
he lives (in my grandmother's case, Paris), under another sky
than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the
midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but
of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly
transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in
which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise
moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person
in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish,
makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his
betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears,
of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever
so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment.
We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our
lips to the magic orifice and invoke&mdash;occasionally for
rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit&mdash;the
Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever
coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in
the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep;
the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our
side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the
Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit
the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were
murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was
listening, cry brutally: "I hear you!"; the ever infuriated
servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the
Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone.</p>
<p>And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with
phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an
abstract sound&mdash;the sound of distance overcome&mdash;and the
voice of the dear one speaks to us.</p>
<p>It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there.
But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen
without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of
seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice
has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and
illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a
distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it
seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold
them. A real presence indeed that voice so near&mdash;in actual
separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over
and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who
spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice
was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise
again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my
heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no
longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my
ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for
ever turned to dust.</p>
<p>This afternoon, alas, at Doncières, the miracle did not occur.
When I reached the post office, my grandmother's call had already
been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some
one was talking who probably did not realise that there was
nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear,
the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced
it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook,
but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it
resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by
hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the
convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter
until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who
told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds
of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself,
mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time
that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to
follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in
which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was
hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice
appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment
that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without
the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the
first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never
oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and
unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of
an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually
restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it
was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness
drained almost&mdash;more than any but a few human voices can
ever have been&mdash;of every element of resistance to others, of
all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at
every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears;
then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of
her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had
scarred it in the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone,
gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it
was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a
presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of
my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from
myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at
every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of
obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the
affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and
indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no
longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in
the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Doncières
altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as
possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to
benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this
little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the
conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a
counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me
altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling
me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to
return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed
me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent,
appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action
after her death (when I should still love her and she would for
ever have abandoned me). "Granny!" I cried to her, "Granny!" and
would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice,
a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to
revisit me when my grandmother was dead. "Speak to me!" but then
it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the
sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she
was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand
face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call
her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals
also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in
the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little
child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not
finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for
me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an
anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we
speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love
to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our
assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were
already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the
ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went
on vainly repeating: "Granny, Granny!" as Orpheus, left alone,
repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post
office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell
him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige
me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what
times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I
felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the
Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or
feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again
to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been
able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom,
to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince,
collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars
(who was Captain de Borodino's nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left
their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the
Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear.</p>
<p>When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the
confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my
departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to
believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first
moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would
not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow
cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table
for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in
the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line,
I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all
these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the
former and the latter's distant passage. And yet they did not
fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different
way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer
obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was
concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more
wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert's brothers in
arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose
going and coming, night and morning, between Doncières and Paris,
broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and
insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily
possibilities of return.</p>
<p>"I don't doubt the truth of what you're saying, or that you
aren't thinking of leaving us just yet," said Saint-Loup,
smiling; "but pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to
me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there's a risk of my not
seeing you; I'm going out to luncheon, I've got leave from the
Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to
be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house
I'm going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in
time."</p>
<p>Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for
me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I
ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word
'trunks' recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the
officials. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother
who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night.
Finally I got my connexion. "Is that you, Granny?" A woman's
voice, with a strong English accent, answered: "Yes, but I don't
know your voice." Neither did I recognise the voice that was
speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me <i>tu</i>, and
not <i>vous</i>. And then all was explained. The young man for
whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name
almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my
hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been
telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted
that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure
coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to
make a twofold error.</p>
<p>The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch
Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where
he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to
go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he
arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way
there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as
myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump
out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it
was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had
been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel
where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not
alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I
attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might
be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that
Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that,
provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he
did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping;
driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a
muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand
raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were
acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know
personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I
arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was
not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been
able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he
had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details,
recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate,
one of the 'old soldiers,' who were watching the regiment
parade.</p>
<p>"You haven't seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any
chance?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He's gone on parade, sir," said the old soldier.</p>
<p>"I never saw him," said the graduate.</p>
<p>"You never saw him," exclaimed the old soldier, losing all
interest in me, "you never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure
he's cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that,
officer's cloth, my word!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're a wonder, you are; officer's cloth," replied the
young graduate, who, reported 'sick in quarters,' was excused
marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy
terms with the veterans. "This officer's cloth you speak of is
cloth like that, is it?"</p>
<p>"Sir?" asked the old soldier angrily.</p>
<p>He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on
the breeches' being made of officer's cloth, but, being a Breton,
coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden,
having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been
English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion
he would go on saying 'Sir?' to give himself time to find words,
then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining
himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better
than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss
over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation.</p>
<p>"Ah! It is cloth like that," he broke out, with a fury the
intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance
diminished. "Ah! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it
is, officer's cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing,
if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it's because I know, I should think."</p>
<p>"Very well, then;" replied the young graduate, overcome by the
force of this argument. "Keep your hair on, old boy."</p>
<p>"There, look, there's the Capstan coming along. No, but just
look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head.
Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he's hot
stuff, he is."</p>
<p>I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by
my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They
neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I
saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse
into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking
part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by
the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his
face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness,
his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some
hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car
had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to
throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched
at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went
nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother;
always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of
what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her
as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but
without taking into account the effects of such a suppression;
now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her
arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called
into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from
me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as
having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in
an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by
herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec.</p>
<p>Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the
drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I
found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not
yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like
a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay
aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of
thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of
myself&mdash;thanks to that privilege which does not last but
which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty
of being a spectator, so to speak, of one's own
absence,&mdash;there was present only the witness, the observer,
with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong
to the house, the photographer who has called to take a
photograph of places which one will never see again. The process
that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my
grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who
are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion
of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images
that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex,
flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them,
makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the
forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to
read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her
mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy,
each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have
failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed,
seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our
eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical
tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play
and retains only those that may help to make its purpose
intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely
material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the
action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the
Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified
emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his
staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back,
the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground
frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents
our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time
to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is
forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and
having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films,
and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased
to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept
concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that
affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as
a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and
has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from
the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils
on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of
cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of
the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still
myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at
the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of
contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room
which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which
dwell the strangers of whom we say "He's begun to age a good
deal," for the first time and for a moment only, since she
vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp,
red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the
lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old
woman whom I did not know.</p>
<p>My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de
Guermantes's collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: "I will
answer for her." And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he
and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other
people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets
that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No
doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to
another person's nature being different from our own, and we do
not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to
influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest,
persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise
contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our
own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them,
these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these
compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with
the actions which before our mind's eye we have made the other
person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we
wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered,
we come up against unseen resistances which may prove
insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be
developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust
inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who
is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup
still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of
his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to
call at her house to see the Elstirs.</p>
<p>I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant
of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to
have gone in and said how d'ye do to him, on my return from
Doncières, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother
said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Françoise had
told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill
humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a
little time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after
several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my
chimney&mdash;instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre,
which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea&mdash;the
cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside;
shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing
open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and
satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window
into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling
brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was
surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had
never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to
Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good
days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves
where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our
memory could not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer
accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself,
without having recognised at first what he was playing.</p>
<p>I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to
Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its
church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that
at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take
the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I
realised this. Similarly, one New Year's afternoon, as night
fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the
illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays
differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I
could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked
forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make
that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of
Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and
to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off;
but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of
Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely
came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in
a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in
shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun.</p>
<p>The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves,
by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for
resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since
they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this
very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks,
which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking
them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and
no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I
should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every
morning.</p>
<p>Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not
have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world
except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the
course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of
plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of
these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise
of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And
she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one
wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered
by the soul of another person, provided always that the other,
however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas
in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have
found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same
way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled
like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to
neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have
been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or
would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and
succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard
me as insolent and ill-bred besides.</p>
<p>She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes,
and would come strolling down the street in which already, as
though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were
squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic
mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman
and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from
the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far
off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in
the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living
exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making
out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was
advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation,
her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was
bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear,
sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps
caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten
her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a
flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in
watching the strokes of a great painter's brush. And when, as she
reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a
faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me,
adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a
masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural,
necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a
particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings,
when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown
of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face
of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile
of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of
her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue
of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her
seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown
struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the
scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and
might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the
mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she
made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity.
After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself
this holy martyr. "But, after all, the streets are public."</p>
<p>The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different
meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded
thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and
precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the
Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world
moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and
sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid
gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in
the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my
parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep.
There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much
thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom
from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking.
Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I
should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a
little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in
the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a
reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep,
and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep
that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further
refraction, my awakening.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. to a fresh
doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into
my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined
that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable;
it would have required a keen&mdash;and quite
useless&mdash;delicacy of perception to seize them all.
Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set,
when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo,
itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely
on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were
being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though
for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of
the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my
imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a
certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a
gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in
a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the
green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore
the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which
existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across
to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream
in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned
gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I
believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me
that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of
what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and
to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was
mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this
dream.</p>
<p>The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were
reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the
darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room,
for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless
arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to
speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we
do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and
I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep
either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we
sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed,
my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my
sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great
allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy
with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me
photographs.</p>
<p>Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with
assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his
aunt. "She's not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn't," he
explained, with innocent self-betrayal. "She's not my old Oriane
any longer, they've gone and changed her. I assure you, it's not
worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too
great a compliment. You wouldn't care to meet my cousin
Poictiers?" he went on, without stopping to reflect that this
could not possibly give me any pleasure. "Quite an intelligent
young woman, she is; you'd like her. She's married to my cousin,
the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for
her. I've told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see
her. She's much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too.
Really a nice person, don't you know, really a good sort." These
were expressions recently&mdash;and all the more
ardently&mdash;taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in
question had a delicate nature. "I don't go so far as to say
she's a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she
lives among; still, she did say to me: 'If he is innocent, how
ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil's Isle.' You see what
I mean, don't you? And then she's the sort of woman who does a
tremendous lot for her old governesses; she's given orders that
they're never to be sent in by the servants' stair, when they
come to the house. She's a very good sort, I assure you. The real
reason why Oriane doesn't like her is that she feels she's the
cleverer of the two."</p>
<p>Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for
one of the Guermantes footmen&mdash;who had no chance of going to
see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would
immediately have been reported to her from the
lodge,&mdash;Françoise was heartbroken at not having been in the
house at the moment of Saint-Loup's visit, but this was because
now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on
the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her
brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who
had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these
visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being
deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would
speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no
dispensation, according to the laws laid down at
Saint-André-des-Champs. And so I never listened to her excuses
without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was
brought to a climax by the way Françoise had of saying not: "I
have been to see my brother," or "I have been to see my niece,"
but "I have been to see the brother," "I just looked in as I
passed to bid good day to the niece" (or "to my niece the
butcheress"). As for her daughter, Françoise would have been glad
to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making
use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were
of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly
to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much
as a sight of "the <i>Intran</i>." She was still less willing to
go to Franchise's sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for
"mountains," said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and
terrible meaning, "aren't really interesting." She could not make
Up her mind to go back to Méséglise, where "the people are so
stupid," where in the market the gossips at their stalls would
call cousins with her, and say "Why, it's never poor Bazireau's
daughter?" She would sooner die than go back and bury herself
down there, now that she had "tasted the life of Paris," and
Françoise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently
nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in
this new Parisian when she said: "Very well, mother, if you don't
get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu."</p>
<p>The weather had turned chilly again. "Go out? What for? To
catch your death?" said Françoise, who preferred to remain in the
house during the week which her daughter and brother and the
butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the
last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely
the doctrine of my aunt Léonie&mdash;a natural
philosopher&mdash;Françoise would add, speaking of this
unseasonable weather: "It is the remnant of the wrath of God!"
But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all
the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever
befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning
sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays;
their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids,
smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were
filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from
Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack
flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought
to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had
turned cold again as in another year at the time of our
preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid,
freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the
boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were
already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the
narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio.</p>
<p>My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A.
J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the
place.</p>
<p>"It's to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I
never knew anything about it. It seems she's a delightful person,
a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her," he told
me. "Another thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of
M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken
him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has
perfect taste, only he's very proud of his name and his
connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a
tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It
appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like
one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis
had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts
of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to
you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good
advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you're
not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out
quite a good career; it's not what I should have chosen for you,
myself; but you'll be a man in no time now, we shan't always be
here to look after you, and we mustn't prevent you from following
your vocation."</p>
<p>If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the
conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the
undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep,
to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with
pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk
and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking
advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity
forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end
from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing,
ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one
invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have
shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not
working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find
expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no
resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized
from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting
as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a
few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not
over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I
pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they
grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really
ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down
in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I
vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to
say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself
to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being
murdered.</p>
<p>My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or
twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was
a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he
said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed
Mme. de Villeparisis. "He tells me, she's his aunt; 'Viparisi,'
he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she's an extraordinarily able
woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit," my father
announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression,
which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of
memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My
mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he
did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de
Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of
some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all
the time the exact amount of the Marquise's intellectual worth,
it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was
not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the
suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter.
Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had
several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And
invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out
just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of
hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself,
but employed Françoise to lick the envelopes for her. As for
myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School
of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old
lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I
eventually did.</p>
<p>My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain,
whether the Ambassador's support would be worth many votes to him
at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an
independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not
venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois's support, he
was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious
gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois,
wishing to be himself the only representative there of the
Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my
father's candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward
for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate
already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to
stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck
by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count
for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de
Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped
that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with
his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That
M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my
father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to
him all the more probable since the Ambassador's willingness to
oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that
no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides,
at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my
father far more markedly than over any other official.</p>
<p>My father had also another encounter about this time, but one
at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the
street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her
comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend.
There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did
Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to
intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: "My dear, I
really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she
won't stay long;" and even: "Listen, dear, I am going to ask you
to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You
know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you." He
would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call.
And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on
catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her,
hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat
confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness
towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has
been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My
father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met
Mme. Sazerat in some one's house. She did not offer my mother her
hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as
one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but
with whom one has since severed all one's relations because she
has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is
worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had
accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound
respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat,
alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a
friend of M. Méline, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He
had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had
asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never
spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take
a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to
being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in
whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be
kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence
of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we
did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of
a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious
things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her
hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an
impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my
grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the
National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could
never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings
without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed.
All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every
incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father
and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon
the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a
collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an
anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and
centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time
and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why
it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few
words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay
between.</p>
<p>Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to
take me to Mme. de Villeparisis's, where I hoped, though I had
not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He
invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we
were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in
the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of
Paris.</p>
<p>I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went
for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend
the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of
merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to
which Aimé had told me that he would be going as head waiter
until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me
who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again
some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but
of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill
health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be
watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while
he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down
the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great
dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the
motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked
like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself
magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec,
this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped
by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec,
to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of
travel.</p>
<p>I left the house early, with Françoise complaining bitterly
because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again
been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl.
Françoise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and
strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his
place.</p>
<p>Before reaching Saint-Loup's, where he was to be waiting for
me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight
since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had
preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:</p>
<p>"Ah! So it's you," he exclaimed, "a man of fashion, and in a
frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit
would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world,
I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do,
before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not
out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your
soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should
go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of
remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere&mdash;which I
am unable to breathe&mdash;of a drawing-room, you pronounce on
your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I
can see it all, you frequent the 'light hearts,' the houses of
the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those
aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the
heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees,
when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if
that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your
tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for
alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon
rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this
Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the
force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep me from
escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet.
Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant
of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To
prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to
send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not
deliquescent enough, not <i>fin de siècle</i> enough for you; it
is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have
confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking
epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old
campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is
no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not
distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get
you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: 'Do this
and ye shall live.' Farewell, Friend."</p>
<p>It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin
that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in
common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid
fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins
of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us,
Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne.</p>
<p>After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had
begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first
leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle
train had set us down at the suburban village in which his
mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge
festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those
peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people
travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only
this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is
stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a
distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a
flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine
that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which
still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each
house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more
uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed
spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn
date, their first communion.</p>
<p>It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor's
office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of
maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for
some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white
satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at
their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
which were the 'follies' of the stewards and favourites of the
great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk
below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved
the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in
quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as
those that I had seen, formed great
quadrilaterals&mdash;separated by low walls&mdash;of snowy
blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so
that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a
Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or
somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a
reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some
fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw,
varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and
play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and
coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open,
azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of
a creamy, sunlit flower.</p>
<p>Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he
did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his
future career in the Army, his position in society, his family,
he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they
were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that
concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his
eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the
kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had
formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to
anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only
about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable
of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was
really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what
his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on,
discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the
narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So
nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a
brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to
maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what
was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever
have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it
was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she
had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would
at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on
her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted
the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general
affection called love must have forced him&mdash;as it forces all
men&mdash;to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of
hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not
exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account
of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to
expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and
their literary theories, and loving him all the time,
really&mdash;he thought) to leave him. "If she is nice to me
to-day," he confided to me, "I am going to give her something
that she'll like. It's a necklace she saw at Boucheron's. It's
rather too much for me just at present&mdash;thirty thousand
francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life.
She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me
and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I
don't believe that is true, really, but I wasn't taking any
risks, so I've arranged with Boucheron, who is our family
jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you're going
to meet her; she's nothing so very wonderful to look at, you
know," (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had
said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her
all the more) "what she has got is a marvellous judgment; she'll
perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the
things she'll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says
things one can go on thinking about for hours; there's really
something about her that's quite Pythian."</p>
<p>On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens,
and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear
and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only
yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly
peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night,
whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings
along the garden paths.</p>
<p>"Listen; I can see you'd rather stop and look at that stuff,
and grow poetical about it," said Robert, "so just wait for me
here, will you; my friend's house is quite close, I will go and
fetch her."</p>
<p>While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these
modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then,
girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and
at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and
pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves,
young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the
breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes
towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons
in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann's park, past
the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an
enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a
meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from
the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been
on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen,
punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a
great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun's face,
like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its
flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver
by the sun's rays.</p>
<p>Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and
then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible
delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a
body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied
incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt
that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually
asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of
eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once 'Rachel when
from the Lord,' her who, but a few years since&mdash;women change
their position so rapidly in that world, when they do
change&mdash;used to say to the procuress: "To-morrow evening,
then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won't
you?"</p>
<p>And when they had 'come round' for her, and she found herself
alone in the room with the 'anyone,' she had known so well what
was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent
woman's precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take
off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to
sound one's chest, never stopping in the process unless the 'some
one,' not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her
shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine
ear and being afraid of their patient's catching a chill, are
satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his
heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her
thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another
had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had
begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only
out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I
felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had
been concentrated in such a way as to make&mdash;out of what was
for me a mechanical toy, nothing more&mdash;the cause of endless
suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these
two elements separately (because I had known 'Rachel when from
the Lord' in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for
the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in
themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea
that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her
life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her
unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in
the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he
not given to learn them, without avail!</p>
<p>I realised also then all that the human imagination can put
behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl's face was, if
it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and
conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and
utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the
inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be
so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I
saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs
when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of
ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of
earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more
than one's family, more than all the most coveted positions in
life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange
creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No
doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert
and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between
which there was no communication, and we should never both see it
from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the
movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply
that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do
anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the
movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the
general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And
beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a
person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start,
that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal
towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and
doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in
order to have for himself, in order that there might not be
offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and
sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at
the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the
instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off,
having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes
her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a
sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but
infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to
swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the
woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere
smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a
thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the
most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case,
when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one's
judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the
crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that
these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to
obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of
destroying one's chances of Platonic love. And it is then a
bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what
were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved.
As for Rachel's favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident
succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned
that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would
have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a
million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he
might have learned could have made him emerge&mdash;since that is
beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of
it by the action of some great natural law&mdash;from the path he
was treading, from which that face could appear to him only
through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The
immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper
subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to
me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her
without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert
and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the
same side of the mystery.</p>
<p>It was not 'Rachel when from the Lord'&mdash;who seemed to me
a small matter&mdash;it was the power of the human imagination,
the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt
to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my
eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that
he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And
it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close
to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but
feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the
garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my
mistake been like the Magdalene's when, in another garden, she
saw a human form and 'thought it was the gardener.' Treasurers of
our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that
reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the
wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the
recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures,
bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for
rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I
exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup's mistress. We cut across
the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most
wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched
and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller,
halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood
erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the
wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew
me a little way in front to explain.</p>
<p>"I should have liked it if you and I could have been alone
together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with
you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt's.
But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her,
and she is so decent to me, don't you know, I hadn't the heart to
refuse her. You'll like her, however, she's literary, you know, a
most sensitive nature, and besides it's such a pleasure to be
with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always
delighted with everything."</p>
<p>I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then
probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself
for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of
affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some
distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his
but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a
little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were
making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the
station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and
accosted by a pair of common little 'tarts' like herself, who
first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: "Hello,
Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train,
and there's room for one more. Come on. We're all going to the
rink," and were just going to introduce to her two
counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when,
noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and
beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a
good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but
still friendly tone. They were two poor little 'tarts' with
collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must
have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them,
or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be
extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering
whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps
her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly
different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had
women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a
hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a
fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a
Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little
'tarts' in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had
for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at
some distance from his own Rachel, the little 'tart' Rachel, the
real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the 'tart' was more real than
the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell
in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of
the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a
hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have
escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two
counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to
nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to
forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less
kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so
deeply moved him, things which he would quote, with a touch of
ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it
was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was
maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever
gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs,
or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into
the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred
thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare
kindnesses on Rachel's part were handsomely paid for by himself,
it would be wrong to say&mdash;and yet, by a crude piece of
reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in
cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands&mdash;that
this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense
to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he
could have found easily and without cost to himself in society,
on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that
his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to
ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this
self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously
the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is
simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one's own
eyes and in other people's as loved in return by the person whom
one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two 'tarts' to
get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter
skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the
names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a
moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle
existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs,
afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or
pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of
the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the
same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his
mistress, but must be something different, for love, and
suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the
power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown
Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his
connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form
of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to
himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she
lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his
reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly
envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to
the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when
she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and
Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined
them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day
which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the
pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had
not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which
until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused
curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day
beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not
known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening
and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But
what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew
that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something
extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain
nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a
first-class carriage; Rachel's magnificent pearls reminded Robert
that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored
her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her,
internalised, as he had always done hitherto&mdash;save during
this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle
of an impressionist painter&mdash;and the train began to
move.</p>
<p>It was, by the way, quite true that she was 'literary.' She
never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism
except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:</p>
<p>"Ah! If you could live with me for a year, we'd see a fine
change. I should keep you on water and you'd be ever so much
better."</p>
<p>"Right you are. Let's begin now."</p>
<p>"But you know quite well I have to work all day!" For she took
her art very seriously. "Besides, what would your people
say?"</p>
<p>And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for
that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which
Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of
champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the
effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his
mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go
hang. Tears sprang to the young woman's eyes; I had been rash
enough to refer to Dreyfus.</p>
<p>"The poor martyr!" she almost sobbed; "it will be the death of
him in that dreadful place."</p>
<p>"Don't upset yourself, Zézette, he will come back, he will be
acquitted all right, they will admit they've made a mistake."</p>
<p>"But long before then he'll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his
children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony
he must be going through; that's what makes my heart bleed. And
would you believe that Robert's mother, a pious woman, says that
he ought to be left on the Devil's Isle, even if he is innocent;
isn't it appalling?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's absolutely true, she does say that," Robert assured
me. "She's my mother, I've no fault to find with her, but it's
quite clear she hasn't got a sensitive nature, like Zézette."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be
'such a pleasure' always ended in trouble. For as soon as
Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he
would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the
room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour,
which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was
more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling
wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and
would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man
or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the
gentleman who, in theatre or café, happened to sit next to them,
or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need
only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and
Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed
it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of
those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who
corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would
beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing
her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had
shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she
even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and
consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her
time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an
assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I
could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was
looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once
remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that,
standing among his coarser colleagues, Aimé, with a modest
brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of
romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine
hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was
distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost
all of them well on in years, presented a series of types,
extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests,
sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the
old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen
nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the
humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres,
where they are represented in the parts of servants or high
priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective
method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary
nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of
College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aimé having
recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the
procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other
tables. Aimé inquired after my grandmother's health; I asked for
news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a
family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air.
Robert's mistress began to gaze at him with a strange
attentiveness. But Aimé's sunken eyes, in which a slight
short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths,
shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the
provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before
coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured
and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years,
like some engraved portrait of Prince Eugène, had been visible
always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that
was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very
curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want
of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of
his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw
attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most,
some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had
raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something
to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the
pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful
husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a
caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light.
And yet Aimé must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis
with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him
now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw
gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks
when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused.</p>
<p>"Anything specially interesting about that waiter, Zézette?"
he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aimé. "One would think you
were studying the part."</p>
<p>"There you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming."</p>
<p>"Beginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken;
I haven't said anything, I'm sure. But I have at least the right
to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec
(otherwise I shouldn't give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel
doesn't walk the face of the earth."</p>
<p>She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in
a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did
not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of
the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed
more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis
declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance
to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner
of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not
affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and
studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun;
for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture,
if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, "Ah! That is
<i>good</i>!" one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear,
and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected
modesty, she said: "Yes, as a sensation I call it distinctly
<i>good</i>." But what more surprised me was that the expressions
peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps,
from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by
him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech,
and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality
that is universal.</p>
<p>In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed
that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She
recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching
prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely
that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that
body, which is yet so different from their own.</p>
<p>I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon
the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my
liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of
commiseration&mdash;against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was
accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her&mdash;the defence of
Berma, saying: "Oh, no, she's a wonderful person, really. Of
course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don't
correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think
of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great
deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she's such a
fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn't care
about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time,
with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind." (Our
ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all
our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under
discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint,
it is enough to stick out one's thumb. But the 'charming quality
of mind' is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two
fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of
dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup's mistress
referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical
superiority which annoyed me because I believed&mdash;quite
mistakenly, as it happened&mdash;that it was she who was inferior
to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an
indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard
for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because
there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then,
unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of
humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect
from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the
position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later,
at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup's mistress shew great deference
towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so
harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my
silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our
dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone's
conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in
the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the
sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members
of the company, so markedly were the waiters' faces those which,
one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure
actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of
Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was
examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached
curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either
side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with
curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have
arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few
murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well
known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being
pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper
lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties
there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at
this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive
Robert away so that she might be alone with Aimé, Rachel began to
make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at
a neighbouring table.</p>
<p>"Zézette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like
that," said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a
moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which
dilated and darkened his swollen features, "if you must make a
scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you
at the theatre afterwards."</p>
<p>At this point a messenger came up to tell Aimé that he was
wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup,
ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an
amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked
out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his
hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower
in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus.</p>
<p>"There; you see!" he said to me in a low voice, "my family
hunt me down even here. Will you, please&mdash;I can't very well
do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well
and he's certain to give us away&mdash;ask him not to go to the
carriage. He can always send some other waiter who doesn't know
me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I'm not known here,
he'll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of
place. Really, it's pretty disgusting that an old
petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be
perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!"</p>
<p>Aimé on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings
to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment,
and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that
they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup's mistress, who
had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that
it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding
fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of
rage.</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed! So it's the young man over there, now, is it?
Thank you for telling me; it's a real pleasure to have this sort
of thing with one's meals! Don't listen to him, please; he's
rather cross to-day, and, you know," she went on, turning to me,
"he just says it because he thinks it smart, that it's the
gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always."</p>
<p>And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous
irritation.</p>
<p>"But, Zézette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making
us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to
imagine you're making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder
he looks, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I think he's charming; for one thing, he's got the
most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women&mdash;you can
feel he must love them."</p>
<p>"You can at least keep quiet until I've left the room, if you
have lost your senses," cried Robert. "Waiter, my things."</p>
<p>I did not know whether I was expected to follow him.</p>
<p>"No, I want to be alone," he told me in the same tone in which
he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite
furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to
which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely
different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning
and character, but which the music assimilates by a common
sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aimé and
asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I
thought of him.</p>
<p>"An amusing expression, hasn't he? Do you know what I should
like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to
have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would
be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract
us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn't it? It's silly of
Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it's only
just what comes into my head, that's all; Robert has nothing to
worry about." She was still gazing at Aimé. "Do look, what dark
eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind
them."</p>
<p>Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a
private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by
another door, without having to pass through the restaurant
again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by
Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing
under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They
were drinking champagne. "Hallo, you!" she cried to him, having
recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word
in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely
uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin's words had had no effect on
me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a
restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this
first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that
she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of
champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a
rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: "I have
nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this
young woman's company are not wasted, since I have had from her,
charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a
scented cigarette and a glass of champagne." I told myself this
because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and
thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps
to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason
that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that
I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his
mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel
which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of
my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it,
sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it
which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne
with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used
to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same.
Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or
travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine,
but every degree of intoxication&mdash;and each must have a
different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a
chart&mdash;lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it
reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had
taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was
of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an
endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the
frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the
procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the
drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was
multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened
by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little
cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more
extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the
Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said
drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight
of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of
intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado
I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I
felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the
minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure
whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous
self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps
there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet
the stranger again in the whole course of my life.</p>
<p>Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant
before his mistress.</p>
<p>"What about that fellow you met this morning, who combines
snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I've forgotten the
story," and he watched her furtively.</p>
<p>"But, my dear boy, there's nothing more than what you've just
said."</p>
<p>"What a bore you are. Then tell her about Françoise in the
Champs-Elysées. She'll enjoy that."</p>
<p>"Oh, do! Bobby is always talking about Françoise." And taking
Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more
original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: "Hallo,
you!"</p>
<p>Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the
depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth,
they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself,
pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some
old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the
young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen
distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead
in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery
torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze
fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent
pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the
information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of
the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted
beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although
of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that
there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the
footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an
actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own
human soul the words of a part.</p>
<p>These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are
in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires,
pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the
theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a
comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in
the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian's face, a
coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned
in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their
dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make
us&mdash;like the dissolution of a dear friend&mdash;begin to
doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of
death.</p>
<p>One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young
woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a
set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had
based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family.
This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely
prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still
farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular
development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain
number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by
their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be
timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her
turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager
would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered
by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited
for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with
jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed
out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the
deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy
woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for
a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the
audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which
succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate
others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the
party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but
now threw at the others glances charged with malicious
connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in
such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although
there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager
rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to
the incident than I had paid to my grandmother's sufferings when
my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy,
the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to
bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not
very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of
grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has
no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has
probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and
voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred
inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which
there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any
pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to
be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined
certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far
from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her
hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good
taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I
preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither
the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been
too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to
approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the
sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this
career in its infancy.</p>
<p>But the opening scene of this afternoon's performance
interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part
the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with
regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images
that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we
beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel
was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on
in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had
one of those faces to which distance&mdash;and not necessarily
that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect
only a larger theatre&mdash;gives form and outline and which,
seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her
one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots,
nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible
and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face,
rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would
have liked to be object of Rachel's attention, to see her again
as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had
not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not
my case but it had been Saint-Loup's when he first saw her on the
stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how
come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy
realm&mdash;that in which she lived&mdash;from which emanated an
exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had
left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to
write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite
prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who
was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too
familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams
of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old
building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery,
from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted
band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew
them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the
human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that
they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent
all the people we know and might have expected to find, there
turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and
who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us
providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have
occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some
other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should
have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them.
The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon
Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that
the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him
nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not
now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for
all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his
actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction
even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes.
And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which
had no place now even in Robert's memory had the result that,
dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the
spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no
features and with freckles, since she was the same person,
telling himself that later on he would take care to find out
which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry,
she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and
it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by
inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He
loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made
happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not
much time is required before one entrusts all one's chances of
happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous
apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the
theatre.</p>
<p>When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage,
alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the
need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this
way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a
setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by
our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so
unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I
should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in
which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely
conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the
first topic that came to my mind:</p>
<p>"You know," I said, "I did come to say good-bye to you the day
I left Doncières; I've not had an opportunity to mention it. I
waved to you in the street."</p>
<p>"Don't speak about it," he replied, "I was so sorry. I passed
you just outside the barracks, but I couldn't stop because I was
late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it."</p>
<p>So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly
impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his
cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a
gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently
this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing
me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed
to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly
and without any instinctive movement to betray his original
impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side
with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by
its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain
emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a
certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a
consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social
life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts
he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had
been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but
for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know
me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye,
without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the
peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute.</p>
<p>The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was
passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of
any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the
eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a
depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected
to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose
had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the
relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her
only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge.
The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment
ago, had vanished. On the other hand&mdash;as though we came
close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a
disk of rosy gold&mdash;on this face, so smooth a surface until
now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations,
cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at
close range not only the feminine features but the painted
canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all
that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me
to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it
by Goethe in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i> had given it a sort of beauty
in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick
of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who
were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a
public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and
hortensia coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page
from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised
to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so
entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday
clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the
course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of
their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so
enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful
and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a
crowded street to follow with one's eyes, between the strips of
canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious
painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the
idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer,
who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of
fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face
darkened.</p>
<p>"You might look the other way," he warned her gloomily. "You
know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can
at least fall off and break their necks, and they're the sort of
people who go about afterwards boasting that you've taken notice
of them. Besides, you know very well you've been told to go to
your dressing-room and change. You'll be missing your call
again."</p>
<p>A group of men&mdash;journalists&mdash;noticing the look of
fury on Saint-Loup's face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what
we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some
scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with
them.</p>
<p>"Oh, but I know him; he's a friend of mine," cried
Saint-Loup's mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. "Look
how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing
away by themselves like his whole body!"</p>
<p>The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person
appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the
clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between
eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his
mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl,
like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which
we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat
the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the
fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's too lovely, the way he copies himself," she cried,
clapping her hands.</p>
<p>"I implore you, my dearest girl," Saint-Loup broke in, in a
tone of utter misery, "do not make a scene here, I can't stand
it; I swear, if you say another word I won't go with you to your
room, I shall walk straight out; come, don't be so
naughty.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. You oughtn't to
stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it'll make you ill," he
went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our
Balbec days.</p>
<p>"Oh! What a good thing it would be if you did go."</p>
<p>"I warn you, if I do I shan't come back."</p>
<p>"That's more than I should venture to hope."</p>
<p>"Listen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved
nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>"Ah! Well, that doesn't surprise me in the least. You gave me
your promise; I ought to have known you'd never keep it. You want
the whole world to know you're made of money, but I'm not a
money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I
know some one else who'll give it to me."</p>
<p>"No one else can possibly give it to you; I've told Boucheron
he's to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone
else have it."</p>
<p>"There you are, trying to blackmail me, you've arranged
everything, I see. That's what they mean by Marsantes, <i>Mater
Semita</i>, it smells of the race," retorted Rachel quoting an
etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for
<i>Semita</i> means 'path' and not 'Semite,' but one which the
Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard
views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the
actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word
'Jew' to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society
could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her
connexion with the Lévy-Mirepoix family. "But this isn't the last
of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn't binding. You
have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of
it and he'll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You'll hear
from me before long; don't you worry."</p>
<p>Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But
circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the
right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I
could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent
expression which he had used at Balbec: "In that way I keep a
hold over her."</p>
<p>"You don't understand what I mean about the necklace. I made
no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly
can to make me leave you, it's only natural, surely, that I
shouldn't give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you
can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be.
You can't seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I'm
always telling you that I'm only a poor devil without a cent to
my name. It's foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What
possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well
that my one interest in life is yourself."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes, please go on," she retorted ironically, with
the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning
to watch the dancer:</p>
<p>"Isn't he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me
couldn't do the things he's doing now." She went closer to him
and, pointing to Robert's furious face: "Look, he's hurt," she
murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty
totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for
Saint-Loup.</p>
<p>"Listen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn't matter
what you do&mdash;in a week you'll be giving anything to get me
back&mdash;I shan't come; it's a clean cut, do you hear, it's
irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it's too late."</p>
<p>Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of
leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that
of remaining with her in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>"But, my dear boy," he went on, to me, "you oughtn't to stand
about here, I tell you, it will make you cough."</p>
<p>I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his
hat and said to one of the journalists:</p>
<p>"Would you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is
bad for my friend."</p>
<p>His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her
way to her dressing-room she turned round and:</p>
<p>"Do they do those tricks with women too, those nice little
hands?" she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an
artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. "You look just
like one yourself, I'm sure I could have a wonderful time with
you and a girl I know."</p>
<p>"There's no rule against smoking that I know of; if people
aren't well, they have only to stay at home," said the
journalist.</p>
<p>The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress.</p>
<p>"Oh! Do stop! You'll make me quite mad," she cried to him.
"Then there will be trouble."</p>
<p>"In any case, sir, you are not very civil," observed
Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in
the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights
and wrongs of an incident that is already closed.</p>
<p>At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above
his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I
could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and
indeed&mdash;without any greater transition than when, at a
simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent
rhythms succeed a graceful andante&mdash;after the courteous
words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a
resounding smack upon the journalist's cheek.</p>
<p>Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to
the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of
war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised
to see the combatants swimming in one another's blood. But what I
could not understand (like people who feel that it is not
according to the rules when a war breaks out between two
countries after some question merely of the rectification of a
frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than
a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to
follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of
friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them,
which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm
raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law
of cause and effect, that action created <i>ex nihilo</i>.
Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence
of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not
retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned
away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one
who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of
dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his
eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had
rushed off, exclaiming: "Good heavens, I believe the curtain's
going up; we shan't get into our seats."</p>
<p>I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his
indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the
surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it
distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation
expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not
even the power of relaxation, the 'play' necessary to take in a
word from me and to answer it. The journalist's friends, seeing
that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still
trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were
absolutely determined that he should be made to suppose that they
had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of
dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought
that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing
resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker's
brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend's not
having shared their several emotions.</p>
<p>"What, didn't it strike you? You must be going blind."</p>
<p>"What I say is that you're a pack of curs," growled the
journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished.</p>
<p>Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with
which they ought&mdash;but they did not think of it&mdash;to have
pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on
certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: "What's all
the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don't take the bit
in your teeth."</p>
<p>I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how
illusory were the grounds upon which Robert's love for 'Rachel
when from the Lord' was based; I was bound now to admit how very
real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually
the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a
break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable
zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner
of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen
Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those
distant impressions, and was hurrying at a 'gymnastic' pace to
overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat
shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I
concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same
time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another;
suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of
ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions
necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup's face and body, a
flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult,
they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They
were merely, however, Saint-Loup's pair of fists, multiplied by
the speed with which they were changing their places in
this&mdash;to all appearance ideal and
decorative&mdash;arrangement. But this elaborate display was
nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was
administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather
than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the
shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his
self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave
fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question
him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and
was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an
offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his
face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he
himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing
with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way
connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It
was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young
soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend
could not get over the audacity of this 'clique' who no longer
even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations,
and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the
same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed
assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris.
And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect,
for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to
the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply
consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute.
Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for
men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think
seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to
enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the
hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup's arm had shot out
instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such
punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to
bring about any uniformity in morals.</p>
<p>These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most
on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be
left alone for a while. After a moment's silence he asked me to
leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis.
He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter
the room together, so that he might appear to have only just
arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already
with me.</p>
<p>As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de
Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the
world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de
Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house,
entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all
that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart
from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law,
perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their
drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the
middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in
some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all
such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the
house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to
be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few
minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had
come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to
the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father
was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not
make it possible to rest content with the theory that the
intimacy&mdash;of more than twenty years' standing&mdash;between
Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been
responsible for the lady's loss of caste in a world where the
smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less
respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years
since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old
friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in
days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than
now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some
of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she
somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived
for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger
generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal
and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to
have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That
'sharp tongue' which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those
far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking
advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself
upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely
sensitive way in which&mdash;giving so delicate a shade not
merely to her words but to her intonation&mdash;Mme. de
Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate
this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval
of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a
marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when
they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of
those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the
silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That
generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of
the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an
intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or
not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of
those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would
have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that
of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position,
that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation.</p>
<p>It is true that they were not specially elevating, the
qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de
Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a
manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word 'restraint' is
not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which
presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at
Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely
unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do
was to make delicate fun of them and to express her
incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and
grace, at the point to which she carried them, became
themselves&mdash;on another plane, and even although they were
employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces&mdash;true artistic
qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social
position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call
elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established
pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length
of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to
the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole
point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge
things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to
which they yield when they choose an expression or start a
friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation,
from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her
conversation, and the same may be said of the <i>Memoirs</i>
which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed
nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having
passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even
noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had
lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and
charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they
had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it
treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is
still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in
conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate
impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a
purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a
certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as
a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy
grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such
a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a
rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she
probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And
between certain literary qualities and social failure the
connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de
Villeparisis's <i>Memoirs</i> to-day, on any page a fitting
epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the
reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been
bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies
by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on
her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot
in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors' or
solicitors' wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme.
de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and,
intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps
failed to realise the importance of not applying to people in
society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those
cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets.</p>
<p>Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one
artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social
success, in order to create from the whole what people in society
call a 'complete woman.' It is the living product of a certain
moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are
lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which
other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make
themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain
curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this
place or that for one's own amusement and not with a view to the
extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one's
social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis
hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a
glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the
hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due
not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always
confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some
one or other because she had seen him and thought him
good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was
amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the
people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun
to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never
fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class
gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged
to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to
appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to
depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of
estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its
mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained.
Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de
Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the
fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in
scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately
impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach
its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost.
She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than
they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say
or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related
to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and
sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of
wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women
whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women's
lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in
different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of
their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of
the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this
way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to
the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly
flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young
people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see
before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis
and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so
dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a
gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days,
devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their
graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering
and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to
her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that
remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great
importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation,
of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him
from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and
while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds
him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing,
sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its
form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like
the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and
not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme.
Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of
Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her
ambition.</p>
<p>No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was&mdash;to
use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann&mdash;'cutting' the
Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how
Queen Marie-Amélie had once said to her: "You are just like a
daughter to me." But such marks of royal friendship, secret and
unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as
the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true
social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear
without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to
keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a
hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could
remember the Queen's using those words to her, she would
nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty
of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a
restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written
neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated
cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young
stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with
a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an
obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head
waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen
to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter
advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if
on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before
emerging into the light of day.</p>
<p>It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis's
drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady
of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests.
They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme.
Leroi occupied, a position known only to the fashionable world,
and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis's receptions were, as
the readers of her <i>Memoirs</i> to-day are convinced that they
must have been, the most brilliant in Paris.</p>
<p>On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving
Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the
advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her
drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and
the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood
out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by
side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw
those&mdash;gifts from the sitters themselves&mdash;of Queen
Marie-Amélie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville
and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped
with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved
with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as
a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have
become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs
and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front
of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished
flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in
saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on
account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off
painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist's
counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this
drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because
the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the
country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom
Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the
autograph letters to herself from various historical personages
which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the
<i>Memoirs</i> which she was preparing for the press, and a
historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had
inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de
Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a
plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently
by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist,
upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors
and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was
true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and
that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the
lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the
anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the
first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second
place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her
family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself
entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly,
a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived,
whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were
already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard,
wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove
like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians,
the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the
differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an
Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the
heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena's, his neck
thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound
'salaams,' completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental.
Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually 'in'
society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord
and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a
rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right
direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille's nose than
of Solomon's. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the
gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with
England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange
and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one
of Decamps's Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of
time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage
of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at
a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark
upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us
forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at
all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in
ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the
gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch
might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that
M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas
it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.)
But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence
we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews,
Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave
with their differences. We know from classical paintings the
faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls
of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris
drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we
are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy
must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial
image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three
dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich
banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like
one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once
historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of
Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images
somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the
entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman
admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger
still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a
medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to
which&mdash;up to the present, at any rate&mdash;the soul is
reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which
we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of
the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at
once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting
before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek
lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is
the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if
I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis's drawing-room taken
photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the
same image&mdash;so disturbing because it does not appear to
emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so
strangely like humanity&mdash;which we find in spirit
photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even
the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom
we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the
supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius
from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table,
to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these
words&mdash;the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch:
"Take care of my top hat."</p>
<p>"Oh, Ministers, my dear sir," Mme. de Villeparisis was saying,
addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the
thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival:
"nobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time,
but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to
invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with
the Duchesse de Berry. 'It will give me pleasure, Florimond,'
said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he
had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing
to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious
at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M.
Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and
give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was
giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those
days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her
card and writing on it 'Tea' or 'Dancing' or 'Music.' But if we
understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence
either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was
given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled
his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M.
Decazes at his ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Yes,
sir, I remember M. Molé very well, he was a clever man&mdash;he
shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the
Academy&mdash;but he was very pompous, and I can see him now
coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in
his hand."</p>
<p>"Ah! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a
pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a
universal habit to carry one's hat in one's hand in one's own
house," observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an
opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the
aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a
sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her
tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: "There, you
see what she's like, she knows everything, she has met everybody,
you can ask her anything you like, she's quite amazing."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, no," replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer
to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which
presently she would begin again to paint, "it was a habit M. Molé
had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the
house, except of course when the King came, because the King
being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a
visitor then in his own drawing-room."</p>
<p>"Aristotle tells us in the second chapter
of.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." ventured M. Pierre, the historian
of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention.
Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia
which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going
to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever
his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often
these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him
as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down
from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently
against the fact that other people's lives were not organised on
a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum
utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found
the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after
setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like
some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found
Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the
portrait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. "Indeed," the latter
remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to
the etiquette for royal visits. "Do you know, I never knew that,"
as though it were strange that he should not have known it
always.</p>
<p>"Talking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my
nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?" Mme. de
Villeparisis asked the librarian. "He told my people, instead of
announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had
called to see me."</p>
<p>"What! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must
have a nerve," exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while
the historian smiled with a stately timidity.</p>
<p>"I was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the
country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in
peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in
Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have
heard so soon," went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests
amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in
itself nothing out of the common to their hostess.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been
collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations
to her <i>Memoirs</i>; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying
their effect on an average public typical of that from which she
would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be
different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in
which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of
middle class ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was 'at home,'
and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion
as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this
distinction is not perceptible in her <i>Memoirs</i>, from which
certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared
because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the
absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap
because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author's
disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are
royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost
impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey
to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de
Villeparisis's parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis
felt the sting of Mme. Leroi's opinion. But hardly anyone to-day
remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into
thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis,
frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been
by the Duc d'Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert,
Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most
brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has
not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the
enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the
friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent
men.</p>
<p>Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the
people who still came to her house and in the
memories&mdash;sometimes slightly 'touched up'&mdash;by means of
which she extended her social activity into the past. And then
there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend
to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her
house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his
services and knew that the only effective method of securing them
was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi
also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered
woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she
would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question
to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with
her novelists and philosophers. "Love?" she had once replied to a
pushing lady who had asked her: "What are your views on
love?"&mdash;"Love? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about
it." When she had any of these literary or political lions in her
house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes,
with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this
to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de
Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations,
ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have
furnished the <i>Memoirs</i> of Mme. de Villeparisis with those
admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so
well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille's
tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this
world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because
the Lerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would
not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis
is the cause of the Lerois' disdain, the disdain of the Lerois
does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the
Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which
the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there
should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with
that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He
knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the
latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order
their carriages to be round at eight.</p>
<p>Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step,
an old lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her
straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style
of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of
three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and
who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth,
had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night
of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of
their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of
society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies
had her own 'Duchesse de Guermantes,' the brilliant niece who
came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have
succeeded in attracting to her house the 'Duchesse de Guermantes'
of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of
terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps
the similarity between their social position and her own gave her
an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured
bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency
of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses
to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had
grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in
the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each
of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance
of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for
life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair,
whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help
being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did
not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same
Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker
than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal
Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit
Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess.</p>
<p>Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the
drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the
Faubourg Saint-Honoré, a bond as compelling as it was hateful
united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have
learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology
through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption,
they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of
origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely,
no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating
one another, to frequent one another's society. Besides, each of
them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her
own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled
the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were
introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was
married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as
there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham
salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies' 'men
about town' nephews&mdash;and Saint-Loup the foremost of
them&mdash;when asked by a friend to introduce him to people,
would answer at once "I will take you to see my aunt
Villeparisis," (or whichever it was) "you meet interesting people
there." They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for
themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the
smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old
men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that
if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because
of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I
objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to
social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond
anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn
dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those
who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining,
proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of
the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or
blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable
number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated
the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created
Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little
different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one
does not tabulate the sum of a person's vices until he has almost
ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the
magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the
completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one
measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that
has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which
is 'society,' the really light women, the true Messalinas,
invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least
seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains
everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to
whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct
falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly
sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has
written&mdash;on the early days of Lamartine&mdash;an essay that
has been crowned by the French Academy. "How d'ye do, Alix?" Mme.
de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady
cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there
was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable
addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it
for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be
spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de
Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old
lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he
was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais.
Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old
lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care
that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian
artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So
that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel
annoyed, the old lady had come in person to tell her about it,
shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that
an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward
results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette
of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the
fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those
lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the
young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in
rhymed charades&mdash;and had acquired the habit of a lofty and
compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal
degradation obliges to be continually making advances&mdash;just
perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning
the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not
existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme.
de Villeparisis: "You see, I'm nowhere near him; please
understand that I'm not interested&mdash;in any sense of the
word, you old cat&mdash;in little boys." But when, twenty minutes
later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general
conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to
her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose
high-sounding name&mdash;she had been born a Choiseul,
moreover&mdash;had a prodigious effect on me.</p>
<p>"I understand, sir, that you are thinkin' of writin' somethin'
about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency," said Mme. de Villeparisis
to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she
allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great
and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness,
the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of
age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic
speech of the old nobility: "I'm goin' to let you see her
portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre."</p>
<p>She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the
little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which
she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still
further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet
and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the
luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea
and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up
the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the
most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen.
"What is rather amusin'," said our hostess, "is that in these
Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the
daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted.
They were very close corporations." "Not admit the King's
daughters," cried Bloch in amazement, "why ever not?" "Why,
because the House of France had not enough quartering after that
low marriage." Bloch's bewilderment increased. "A low marriage?
The House of France? When was that?" "Why, when they married into
the Medicis," replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural
manner. "It's a fine picture, ain't it, and in a perfect state of
preservation," she added.</p>
<p>'My dear," put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, "surely you
remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was
this one that was the copy."</p>
<p>"I should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on
painting Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don't
remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn't you
that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at
dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein's."</p>
<p>Alix's shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and
motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the
appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she
seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her
cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see another fine portrait," began the historian.</p>
<p>The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the
room.</p>
<p>"Well, how are you?" Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without
moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she
held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any
notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: "That
is the portrait of the Duchesse de La
Rochefoucauld.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so
finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a
little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though
they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision)
came in bearing a card on a salver.</p>
<p>"It is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme.
la Marquise."</p>
<p>"Did you tell him I was at home?"</p>
<p>"He heard the voices."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well then, shew him in. It's a man who was
introduced to me," she explained. "He told me he was very anxious
to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here
he's taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn't do to
hurt people's feelings. Sir," she went on to me, "and you, Sir,"
to the historian of the Fronde, "let me introduce my niece, the
Duchesse de Guermantes."</p>
<p>The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he
seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this
salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his
mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de
Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her
torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and
bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face
or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before
them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with
manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on
her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing
certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified
to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention.</p>
<p>The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for
Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was
Legrandin.</p>
<p>"Thank you so very much for letting me come and see you," he
began, laying stress on the word 'very.' "It is a pleasure of a
quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old
solitary; I assure you that its
repercussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." He stopped short on
catching sight of me.</p>
<p>"I was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the
Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the
<i>Maxims</i>; it's a family picture."</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies
for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to
go and see her. "I hear all about you from Madeleine," she
added.</p>
<p>"She was at luncheon with me to-day," said the Marquise of the
Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de
Villeparisis could never say that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what
I had been told of his father's change of attitude towards him,
that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be
the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my
desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces
those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good
fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. "Yes, I
do lead a delightful existence," Bloch assured me with a
beatified smile. "I have three great friends; I do not wish for
one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is
the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity." I fancy
that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me
envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in
his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the
commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: "Oh, it was nothing,
really," and so forth, when, to my question: "Was it a good
show?" put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to
which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level,
careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else:
"Why, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn't have been better.
It was really charming!"</p>
<p>"What you have just told us interests me enormously," said
Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, "for I was saying to myself
only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in
the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will
venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental
rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this
afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall
remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from
Joubert, friends of the memory. You have never read Joubert? Oh!
he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this
evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make
you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a
great deal of charm all the same."</p>
<p>I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him,
but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope
that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a
remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever
the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been
trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian.</p>
<p>"And this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse,
who was married first of all to M. de Luynes."</p>
<p>"My dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande;
she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you
weren't engaged I'd have sent round to ask you to come. Mme.
Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by
Queen Carmen Sylva in the author's presence. It was too
beautiful!"</p>
<p>"What treachery!" thought Mme. de Villeparisis. "Of course
that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de
Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement," she
replied, "but I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her
great days, she's a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen
Sylva's poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta
brought her, to recite a canto of the <i>Inferno</i>, by Dante.
In that sort of thing she's incomparable."</p>
<p>Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her
gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the
surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation,
green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter
would level her with the dust.</p>
<p>"Now, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait
of Mme. de Montmorency," Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin,
to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again.</p>
<p>Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de
Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at
her aunt.</p>
<p>"It's M. Legrandin," murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, "he has a
sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more
to you than it does to me."</p>
<p>"What! Oh, but I know her quite well!" exclaimed Mme. de
Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. "That is to say, I
don't know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the
husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the
wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can't tell
you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to
London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the
British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house,
I'm going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster.
And don't for a moment suppose that it's an easy thing to do. On
the pretence that she's dying of some disease she's always at
home, it doesn't matter whether you arrive at seven at night or
nine in the morning, she's ready for you with a dish of
strawberry tarts.</p>
<p>"No, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity," Mme. de
Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. "She's
an impossible person, she talks about 'plumitives' and things
like that." "What does 'plumitive' mean?" asked Mme. de
Villeparisis. "I haven't the slightest idea!" cried the Duchess
in mock indignation. "I don't want to know. I don't speak that
sort of language." And seeing that her aunt really did not know
what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing
that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of
her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: "Why, of
course," she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her
pretended ill humour kept in check, "everybody knows what it
means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But
it's a dreadful word. It's enough to make your wisdom teeth drop
out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that.</p>
<p>"And so that's the brother, is it? I hadn't realized that yet.
But after all it's not inconceivable. She has the same doormat
docility and the same mass of information like a circulating
library. She's just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as
boring. Yes, I'm beginning to see the family likeness now quite
plainly."</p>
<p>"Sit down, we're just going to take a dish of tea," said Mme.
de Villeparisis to her niece. "Help yourself; you don't want to
look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as
well as I do."</p>
<p>Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and
went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round
her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing
no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis's
drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once
hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to
hurt him, say: "Well, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a
tea-party when I find you here too." M. Legrandin concluded from
this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of
me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little
wretch who delighted only in doing mischief.</p>
<p>"You might at least have the civility to begin by saying how
d'ye do to me," he replied, without offering me his hand and in a
coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of
possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what
he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking
relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What
happens is that since we are determined always to keep our
feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the
manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is
within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard,
the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who
receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of
our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and
uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from
confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be
guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective
idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having
hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring
perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin
had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to
another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or
affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position
on this.</p>
<p>"Naturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go
anywhere," he went on in lower tones, "although I am perfectly
free to do what I choose, still I can't behave like an absolute
boor."</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it
was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy
which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy,
sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this
drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I
felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more
discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was
nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy
discolouration of her cheeks&mdash;which ought rather, surely, to
have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes&mdash;was the
effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open
air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know
many of the Duchess's peculiarities, notably (to speak for the
moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the
charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her
eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of
an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even
when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from
its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which
there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the
pastry-cook's in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country
sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my
attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise
have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found
some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told
myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the
world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life
which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had
just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in
this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it
produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where
the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of
effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of
the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin
skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of
intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the
incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which
filled them from within and the outside images that were
reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite
so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis's at an
evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the
Marquise's 'days,' at one of those tea-parties which are for
women no more than a brief halt in the course of their
afternoon's outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have
been driving through the streets, they waft into the close
atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air
outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late
afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can
hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes
wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they
recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray
where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope
adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was
the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when
Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix.
With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her
pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme
tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles
on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins
by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually
studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then
inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that
human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however
insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a
person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged
vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her
aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back
to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of
perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that
Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her
from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt
had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that
of a spot of grease or a layer of dust.</p>
<p>That admirable writer G&mdash;&mdash; entered the room; he had
come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a
tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again,
gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight
for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity
making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence.
He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to
her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme.
de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there
were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to
Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner
occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the
Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition
always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when
married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives,
who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot
on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most
fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that
their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any
possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary
widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not
endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under
doctor's orders, and as he might have said that she could not
stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or
travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true
that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes' the
Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Françoise,
hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the
belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of
accidence, 'the Sagante'), and plenty more, but their presence
was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or
such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them.
Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the
Duc de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it
impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the
great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these
thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her
jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court
of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the
Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be,
that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the
name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among
them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess's
marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the
rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they
could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that
the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did
not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives
were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men
alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature,
science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least
with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition
such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the
midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military
matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of
friendship with Thiers, Mérimée and Augier, felt that a place
must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she
had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once
condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been
received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as
family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does
not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested
if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by Mérimée and
Meilhac and Halévy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from
the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in
conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and
the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of
element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician
to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of
cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention
had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing
effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having
asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet
this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive
at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about
the weather. They sat down to luncheon. "Do you like this way of
doing eggs?" she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which
she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her
exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from
Guermantes: "Give Monsieur some more eggs," she would tell the
butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must
surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged
to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the
Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went
on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without
having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for
clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on
eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of
remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came
to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said
about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to
which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me
a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter
of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all
about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about
it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him
think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in
talking trivialities until it is time to part,
without&mdash;whether from shyness, from audacity or from
awkwardness&mdash;the great secret which they would have been
happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their
hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this
silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always
waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as
characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her.
Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat
different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all
less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide
culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of
bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which
indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though,
for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or
Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of
true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and
charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of
authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some
dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him
modify a situation or alter an ending.</p>
<p>If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in
the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied's wedding, I
had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of
Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least
thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound,
mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry
or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be
disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person
who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in
love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were
fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that
amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that
colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not
to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind.
Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup,
people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce
without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a
person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised
to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her
name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious
tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their
part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the
profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an
affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the
most natural tone: "The Duchesse de Guermantes," as though it
were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody
assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever
talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting
people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they
spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all
the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even
that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like
Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I
understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated
with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent
remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was
used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would
perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so
special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial
conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen
recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the
names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have
given me a picture of her life.</p>
<p>"I thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come
and see you to-day," said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt.</p>
<p>"I haven't set eyes on your husband for some days," replied
Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. "In fact, I
haven't seen him&mdash;well, I have seen him once,
perhaps&mdash;since that charming joke he played on me of making
my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden."</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners
of her mouth as though she were biting her veil,</p>
<p>"We met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi's. You
wouldn't know her now, she's positively enormous; I'm sure she
must have something the matter with her."</p>
<p>"I was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked
like a frog,"</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to
signify that she acknowledged the compliment.</p>
<p>"I don't remember making such a charming comparison, but if
she was one before, now she's the frog that has succeeded in
swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn't quite that,
because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist,
she's more like a frog in an interesting condition."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is quite clever," said Mme. de Villeparisis,
secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display
of her niece's wit.</p>
<p>"It is purely <i>arbitrary</i>, though," answered Mme. de
Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann
would have done, "for I must admit I never saw a frog in the
family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not
asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she's been
since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next
week. I promised I'd let you know in good time."</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which
emerged: "I know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night
before last. Hannibal de Bréauté was there. He came and told me
about it, and was quite amusing, I must say."</p>
<p>"There was a man there who's a great deal wittier than Babal,"
said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship with
M. de Bréauté-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their
intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. "I mean M.
Bergotte."</p>
<p>I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty;
in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the
intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely
remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse
through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which,
making the Duchess smile, M. de Bréauté was holding with her, in
the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation
between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to
see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Bréauté. But
above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on
the evening of <i>Phèdre</i>, that I had not gone up and spoken
to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de
Villeparisis:</p>
<p>"He is the only person I have any wish to know," went on the
Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental
tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known
intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic
snobbishness. "It would be such a pleasure."</p>
<p>The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been
so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give
Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on
the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled
to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring
the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon.</p>
<p>"I gather that he didn't behave very well, he was presented to
M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him," said Mme. de
Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have
recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper.
"He never once said 'Monseigneur' to him," she added, with an air
of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the
refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go
on his knees before his Holiness.</p>
<p>Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not,
however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather
to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put
to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of
appreciating Bergotte's originality, it was a fact which I was
later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de
Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did
consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Bréauté. Thus it is that
such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are
delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are
superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough
outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will
establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old
standards.</p>
<p>The Comte d'Argencourt, Chargé d'Affaires at the Belgian
Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came
limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de
Guermantes and H. H. the Duc de Châtellerault, whom Mme. de
Guermantes greeted with: "How d'ye do, young Châtellerault," in a
careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a
great friend of the young Duke's mother, which had given him a
deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden
hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type,
these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of
the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room.
Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid
their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the
Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming
into the mayor's office and not knowing what to do with his hat.
Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the
awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:</p>
<p>"No, no," he said, "don't leave them on the floor, they'll be
trodden on."</p>
<p>A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of
his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing
azure which froze the well-meaning historian.</p>
<p>"What is that person's name?" I was asked by the Baron, who
had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis.</p>
<p>"M. Pierre," I whispered.</p>
<p>"Pierre what?"</p>
<p>"Pierre: it's his name, he's a historian, a most distinguished
man."</p>
<p>"Really? You don't say so."</p>
<p>"No, it's a new fashion with these young men to put their hats
on the floor," Mme. de Villeparisis explained. "I'm like you, I
can never get used to it. Still, it's better than my nephew
Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see
him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him
if he's come to wind the clocks."</p>
<p>"You were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Molé's
hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter
on hats," said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by
Mme. de Villeparisis's intervention, but in so faint a voice that
no one but myself overheard him.</p>
<p>"She really is astonishing, the little Duchess," said M.
d'Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to
G&mdash;&mdash;. "Whenever there's a famous man in the room
you're sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be
the lion of the party over there. It can't always be M. de
Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d'Avenel. But then
it's bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday
evening at the Doudeauvilles', where by the way she was looking
splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train,
she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the
other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general
public, at a respectful distance where they couldn't hear what
was being said, were wondering whether there wasn't going to be
war. Really, you'd have said she was a Queen, holding her
circle."</p>
<p>Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her
painting.</p>
<p>"Those flowers are a truly celestial pink," said Legrandin, "I
should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just
as there is sky-blue. But," he lowered his voice in the hope that
he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, "I think I
shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your
rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way
behind, with their laborious, dead herbals."</p>
<p>An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself
preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is
done them.</p>
<p>"What makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of
their period, which we don't have now, but they did it with great
skill."</p>
<p>"Ah! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious
theory," exclaimed Legrandin.</p>
<p>"I see you're painting some fine cherry blossoms&mdash;or are
they may-flowers?" began the historian of the Fronde, not without
hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his
voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the
hats.</p>
<p>"No; they're apple blossom," said the Duchesse de Guermantes,
addressing her aunt.</p>
<p>"Ah! I see you're a good countrywoman like me; you can tell
one flower from another."</p>
<p>"Why yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple
blossom was over now," said the historian, seeking wildly to
cover his mistake.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, no; far from it, it's not out yet; the trees won't
be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks
perhaps," said the librarian who, since he helped with the
management of Mme. de Villeparisis's estates, was better informed
upon country matters.</p>
<p>"At least three weeks," put in the Duchess; "even round Paris,
where they're very far forward. Down in Normandy, don't you know,
at his father's place," she went on, pointing to the young Duc de
Châtellerault, "where they have some splendid apple trees close
to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they're never really
pink until after the twentieth of May."</p>
<p>"I never see them," said the young Duke, "because they give me
hay fever. Such a bore."</p>
<p>"Hay fever? I never heard of that before," said the
historian.</p>
<p>"It's the fashionable complaint just now," the librarian
informed him.</p>
<p>"That all depends, you won't get it at all, probably, if it's
a good year for apples. You know Le Normand's saying: 'When it's
a good year for apples.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.'," put in M.
d'Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to
give himself a Parisian air.</p>
<p>"You're quite right," Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece,
"these are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round
and asked me to accept them as a present. You're surprised, I
dare say, Monsieur Valmère," she turned to the librarian, "that a
florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be
an old woman, but I'm not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a
few friends," she went on with a smile that might have been taken
as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help
feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the
friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished
circles.</p>
<p>Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de
Villeparisis was painting.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Marquise," said the historian, sitting down
again, "even though we should have another of those Revolutions
which have stained so many pages of our history with
blood&mdash;and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,"
he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to
make sure that there was no 'disaffected' person in the room,
though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was,
"with a talent like yours and your five languages you would be
certain to get on all right." The historian of the Fronde was
feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But
he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six
nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind,
paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his
melancholy face began to droop like an old man's.</p>
<p>Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate
gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the
glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water
was spilled on the carpet.</p>
<p>"Really, you have the fingers of a fairy," went on (to the
Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that
moment, had not noticed Bloch's clumsiness.</p>
<p>But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his
shame in insolence retorted: "It's not of the slightest
importance; I'm not wet."</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe
the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the
two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes,
with the injunction:</p>
<p>"Remember to tell Gisèle and Berthe" (the Duchesses d'Auberjon
and de Portefin) "to be here a little before two to help me," as
she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange
the tables.</p>
<p>She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de
Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to
the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have
no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as
food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she
need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not
a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old
sister&mdash;who needed and received tactful handling&mdash;of
their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her
trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them
as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew
(none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious
race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be
anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear
fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or
share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their
occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at
her five o'clock tea-parties as, later on, in her <i>Memoirs</i>,
of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a
preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected
audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and
kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society
of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the
public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and
such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme.
de Villeparisis&mdash;failing that section of the fashionable
world which did not call upon her&mdash;the movement, the
novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like
these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it
well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though
without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes),
dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a
light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her
drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He
had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was
of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more
different still what he thought: "If people can't train their
servants to put flowers where they won't be knocked over and wet
their guests and probably cut their hands, it's much better not
to go in for such luxuries," he muttered angrily. He was one of
those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think
of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not
admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to
spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his
mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at
which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another
minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either
because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends,
and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to
rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to
any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to
society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them
all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he
lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his
collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses
with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped
him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was
to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to
leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois
(whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement
to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having
already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had
mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise's
drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those
parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe
thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress
'with pure eyes, fair as Hera,' who would recite lyrical prose
with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady's name
Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of
Saint-Loup's mistress.</p>
<p>"I have better news," she murmured in my ear. "I really
believe he's quite cooled off now, and that before very long
they'll be parted&mdash;in spite of an officer who has played an
abominable part in the whole business," she added. For Robert's
family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de
Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser's instance,
to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an
infamous intrigue. "It's really too bad of him," said Mme. de
Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the
Guermantes, even the most depraved. "Too, too bad," she repeated,
giving the word a trio of 't's. One felt that she had no doubt of
the Prince's being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness
of heart was the old lady's dominant quality, her expression of
frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she
articulated with an ironical emphasis: "The Prince de
Borodino!"&mdash;speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply
did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a
mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding
between us.</p>
<p>"I have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray," said
Bloch, "dirty dog as he is, because he's so extremely well-bred.
I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people,
they're so rare," he went on, without thinking, since he was
himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were
giving. "I will give you an example which I consider most
striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young
gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled
chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a
pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley,
who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He
introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman's name; one
never does catch people's names when one's introduced to them,"
he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father's
witticisms. "De Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no
fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease.
Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the
young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!"</p>
<p>The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface,
for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room.
The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his
father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to
tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign
upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would
ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it.</p>
<p>"I learned this," Bloch informed us, "from the person who
holds Sir Rufus's power of attorney; he is a friend of my father,
and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful
individual," he assured us with that affirmative energy, that
note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions
that did not originate with oneself.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, "how
much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in
the least, you quite understand, don't you. I'm interested from
the Balzacian point of view. You don't happen to know what it's
in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?"</p>
<p>I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising
his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without
waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de
Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. "Of
course, if it's bad for you!" Bloch was downcast. "But you can't
say it's not hot in here." And breaking into a laugh he put into
the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support
against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these
well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any
of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to
their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat
with: "What's the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should
say. I'm not surprised. I'm simply dripping. And I have not, like
the sage Antenor, son of the river Alpheus, the power to plunge
myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my
body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with
fragrant oils." And with that need which people feel to outline
for the use of others medical theories the application of which
would be beneficial to their own health: "Well, if you believe
it's good for you! I must say, I think you're quite wrong. It's
exactly what gives you your cold."</p>
<p>Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He
would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus
case. "There's a mentality at work there which I don't altogether
understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview
out of this eminent diplomat," he said in a tone of sarcasm, so
as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador.</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud,
but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong
Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far
off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on
by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to
the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the
paternal pleasantry: "Haven't I read a learned treatise by him in
which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove
that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a
Japanese defeat? He's fairly paralytic now, isn't he? I'm sure
he's the old boy I've seen taking aim at his chair before sliding
across the room to it, as if he was on wheels."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a
minute," the Marquise went on, "I don't know what he can be
doing."</p>
<p>She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she
made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her
old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: "Go
and tell M. de Norpois to come in" she ordered him, "he is
sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty
minutes, and I've been waiting now for an hour and
three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything
you want to know," she said gruffly to Bloch. "He doesn't approve
much of the way things are going."</p>
<p>For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of
the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken
the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she
still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady,
and remained outside and above the political relations which he
was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of
everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day
would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to
Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see
him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or
help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to
the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that
evening she would say:</p>
<p>"I hear they've been down here bothering you. I trust things
are going better."</p>
<p>"You are not in a hurry?" she now asked Bloch.</p>
<p>"No, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in
fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my
biliary ducts," he explained, articulating the last words with a
fiendish irony.</p>
<p>"Why, that's where my nephew Châtellerault's got to go, you
must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He's a nice
boy, you know," said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well
have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew
had no reason not to be friends with each other.</p>
<p>"Oh, I dare say he wouldn't care about that&mdash;I don't
really know him&mdash;at least I barely know him. He is sitting
over there," stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion.</p>
<p>The butler could not have delivered his mistress's message
properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just
come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had
picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came
forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis's hand with great ceremony,
asking after her health with all the interest that people shew
after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had
already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which
she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining
room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being
shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de
Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: "Who is that
old idiot?" Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de
Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch's nature,
the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger
generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd.
However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed
delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the
salutations were addressed.</p>
<p>"Monsieur l'Ambassadeur," said Mme. de Villeparisis, "I should
like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le
Marquis de Norpois." She made a point, despite her casual usage
of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as "Monsieur
l'Ambassadeur," as a social convention as well as from an
exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which
the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive
application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more
ceremonious, in relation to one particular man&mdash;which, in
the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties
that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out
instantly as her lover.</p>
<p>M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent
his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the
famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and
murmured: "I am delighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." whereat his
young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat
was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: "Not at all!
On the contrary, it is I who am delighted." But this ceremony,
which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis,
repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old
friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the
deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:</p>
<p>"Just ask him anything you want to know; take him into the
other room if it's more convenient; he will be delighted to talk
to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus
case," she went on, no more considering whether this would suit
M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the
Duchesse de Montmorency's portrait before having it lighted up
for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a
cup.</p>
<p>"You must speak loud," she warned Bloch, "he's a little deaf,
but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck
very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn't it;" she raised her
voice, "you knew Bismarck well?"</p>
<p>"Have you got anything on the stocks?" M. de Norpois asked me
with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the
opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt
obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it
was my own which he had inadvertently taken. "You shewed me a
somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good
deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what
you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it
on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You
were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly."
"You're not to say anything against Bergotte," put in the
Duchess. "I don't dispute his talent as a painter; no one would,
Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a
large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these
days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the
novelist's business is rather to weave a plot and edify his
readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or
tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at
our good friend A. J.'s," he went on, turning again to
myself.</p>
<p>I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de
Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself
asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to
Mme. Swann's. "Another of my great favourites," I told him, "is
Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful
examples of his work, particularly that admirable <i>Bunch of
Radishes</i> which I remember at the Exhibition and should so
much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!" And indeed,
if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what
picture I liked best, I should have named this <i>Bunch of
Radishes</i>. "A masterpiece?" cried M. de Norpois with a
surprised and reproachful air. "It makes no pretence of being
even a picture, it is merely a sketch." (He was right.) "If you
label a clever little thing of that sort 'masterpiece,' what have
you got to say about Hébert's <i>Virgin</i> or
Dagnan-Bouveret?"</p>
<p>"I heard you refusing to let him bring Robert's woman," said
Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the
Ambassador aside. "I don't think you'll miss much, she's a
perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and
besides she's grotesquely ugly."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?" asked M.
d'Argencourt.</p>
<p>"Yes, didn't you know that she performed in my house before
the whole of Paris, not that that's anything for me to be proud
of," explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad
nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it
be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her
foolishness. "Hallo, I suppose I ought to be going now," she
added, without moving.</p>
<p>She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words
were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying
a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the
often strained relations that existed between her and the
enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing
years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the
considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the
genial, cynical gaze&mdash;dazzled a little by the brightness of
the setting sun&mdash;of the little round pupils lodged in the
exact centre of his eyes, like the 'bulls' which 'the excellent
marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and
precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious
slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was
afraid of treading on ladies' skirts and interrupting
conversations. A permanent smile&mdash;suggesting a 'Good King of
Yvetot'&mdash;slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a
shark's fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped
by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to
him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement,
or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the
assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: "How do, my boy; how
do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;"
and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when
he had been told my name: "How do, my young neighbour, how's your
father? What a splendid fellow he is!" He made no great
demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him
good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket
of her little apron.</p>
<p>Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily
growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to
his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all
the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of
means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to
control the latter's self-sufficiency. One could understand,
moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so
unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was
still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the
purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god's.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me she performed in your house?" M.
d'Argencourt asked the Duchess.</p>
<p>"Well, don't you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of
lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her <i>dress</i>." Mme. de
Guermantes shared her aunt's affectation of pronouncing certain
words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her 'r's
like Mme. de Villeparisis.</p>
<p>Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had
taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more
freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a
word about my father's Academic chair. He tried first of all to
postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I
was going to Balbec. "What? Going again to Balbec? Why, you're a
regular globe-trotter." He listened to what I had to say. At the
name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I
conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M.
Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist's
having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a
positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening
hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in
spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over
his half-hearted efforts at silence: "No, no," he said to me with
emotion, "your father <i>must not</i> stand. In his own interest
he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect
to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by
such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be
elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He
is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that
counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes.
Your father has an important goal in life; he should march
straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to
beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than
flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many
votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some
time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is
nothing to be done. Later on, I don't say. But he must wait until
the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice;
not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the <i>farÀ da
sè</i> of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me
about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to
him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to
dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to
understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used
to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put
himself forward as a candidate, <i>Principis obsta</i>. His
friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he
suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed," he broke
forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face,
"I am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear
coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply
because I am fond of him (we are known as the
inseparables&mdash;<i>Arcades ambo</i>), simply because I know
the immense service that he can still render to his country, the
reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out
of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I
should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him
to understand that I should not." (I seemed to discern in his
eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) "So that to
give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part."
M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brother Academicians as
old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or
academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of
character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the
advantage of being able to say: "Ah! If it only rested with me!"
than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself
has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction.
"I may tell you," he concluded, "that in the best interests of
you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected
in ten or fifteen years' time." Words which I assumed to have
been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of
any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall
when the course of events had given them a different meaning.</p>
<p>"You haven't thought of giving the Institute an address on the
price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose," the historian of
that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. "You could make
a considerable success of a subject like that," (which was to
say, "you would give me a colossal advertisement,") he added,
smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of
feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double
horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I
had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly
I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a
Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of
the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the
essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay
more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor
Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cottards interest:
"Now this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it,
would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the
Academy of Medicine!" He had not ventured to press the matter but
had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid,
anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the
face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were
not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but
psychological like physical laws have a more or less general
application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an
identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals,
as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart,
which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the
Ambassador's reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of
noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her
at work.</p>
<p>"You know who' we're talking about, Basin?" the Duchess asked
her husband.</p>
<p>"I can make a pretty good guess," said the Duke.</p>
<p>"Ah! As an actress she's not, I'm afraid, in what one would
call the great tradition."</p>
<p>"You can't imagine," went on Mme. de Guermantes to M.
d'Argencourt "anything more ridiculous."</p>
<p>"In fact, it was drolatic," put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd
vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no
fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a
complete imbecile.</p>
<p>"What I fail to understand," resumed the Duchess, "is how in
the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of
course I know one mustn't discuss that sort of thing," she added,
with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose
last illusion had long been shattered. "I know that anybody may
fall in love with anybody else. And," she went on, for, though
she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its
dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of
conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, "that is the
really nice thing about love, because it's what makes it so
'mysterious.'"</p>
<p>"Mysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that's a bit beyond
me," said the Comte d'Argencourt.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, yes, it's a very mysterious thing, love," declared
the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the
world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian
assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something
more than just noise in the <i>Walküre</i>. "After all, one never
does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may
not be at all what we think," she added with a smile, repudiating
at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested.
"After all, one never knows anything, does one?" she concluded
with an air of weary scepticism. "Besides, one understands,
doesn't one; one simply can't explain other people's choices in
love."</p>
<p>But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to
abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup's choice.</p>
<p>"All the same, don't you know, it is amazing to me that a man
can find any attraction in a person who's simply silly."</p>
<p>Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup's name mentioned and gathering that
he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous
that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds,
and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once
he had established the principle that he himself was of great
moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie
(an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable)
deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them
seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a
lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La
Boulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give
certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the
defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way
Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted
on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there
be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who
thought only of doing the 'right thing,' a La Boulie man, and
against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in
the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?</p>
<p>"I say, though, what about Swann?" objected M. d'Argencourt,
who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his
cousin's speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation,
and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in
love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction.</p>
<p>"Oh, but Swann's case was quite different," the Duchess
protested. "It was a great surprise, I admit, because she's just
a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one
time good looking."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh!" muttered Mme. de Villeparisis.</p>
<p>"You never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points,
very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still
dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she's horrible, but
she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me
any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so
unnecessary." The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of
the common, but as M. d'Argencourt began to laugh she repeated
these last words&mdash;either because she thought them amusing or
because she thought it nice of him to laugh&mdash;and looked up
at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her
femininity to that of her wit. She went on: "Yes, really, it
wasn't worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have
some charm and I can quite understand anybody's falling in love
with her, but if you saw Robert's girl, I assure you, you'd
simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody's going to quote
Augier at me: 'What matters the bottle so long as one gets
drunk?' Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he
certainly hasn't shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle!
First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to
fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a
mere nothing&mdash;what?&mdash;and she announced that she was
going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you'd
heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I'm
sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the
<i>Seven Princesses</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Seven Princesses</i>! Dear, dear, what a snob she must
be!" cried M. d'Argencourt. "But, wait a minute, why, I know the
whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn't
understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to
him."</p>
<p>"It isn't by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?" asked the
historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical
allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed
unnoticed.</p>
<p>"So you know the <i>Seven Princesses</i>, do you?" replied the
Duchess, "I congratulate you! I only know one, but she's quite
enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six.
If they are all like the one I've seen!"</p>
<p>"What a goose!" I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness
of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this
proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. "To
think that's the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really,
I'm too kind. Well, it's my turn now not to want to see her."
Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my
thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to
ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain
quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to
talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a
stranger.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you what it was like," the Duchess went on; "you
simply couldn't help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the
other way, I'm sorry to say, for the young person was not at all
pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can't
say I'm sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the
lady would perhaps have come again, and I don't quite see
Marie-Aynard approving of that."</p>
<p>This was the name given in the family to Robert's mother, Mme.
de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish
her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavière, also a
Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and
brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her
husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or
Marie-Hedwige.</p>
<p>"To begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night
before, which was a wonderful affair!" went on Mme. de Guermantes
in ironical pursuit of her theme. "Just imagine, she uttered a
sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then
she stopped; she didn't open her mouth&mdash;I'm not
exaggerating&mdash;for a good five minutes."</p>
<p>"Oh, I say," cried M. d'Argencourt.</p>
<p>"With the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to
her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said&mdash;I
give you her actual words&mdash;'One ought always to repeat a
thing as though one were just composing it oneself.' When you
think of it, that really is monumental."</p>
<p>"But I understood she wasn't at all bad at reciting poetry,"
said one of the two young men.</p>
<p>"She hasn't the ghost of a notion what poetry is," replied
Mme. de Guermantes. "However, I didn't need to listen to her to
tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her
lilies. I knew at once that she couldn't have any talent when I
saw those lilies!"</p>
<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>"I hope, my dear aunt, you aren't angry with me, over my
little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I've come to
ask your forgiveness.'</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I'm not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at
my table, if you're hungry.&mdash;Come along, M. Valmère, you're
the daughter of the house," Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the
librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry.</p>
<p>M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had
come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined
with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being
held out to him.</p>
<p>"This gentleman makes you an admirable daughter," commented M.
d'Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme.
de Villeparisis's little joke in circulation.</p>
<p>The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of
the Fronde.</p>
<p>"You perform your functions admirably," said the latter,
startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the
crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at
those who had anticipated him.</p>
<p>"Tell me, my dear aunt," M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de
Villeparisis, "who was that rather good-looking man who was going
out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a
sweeping bow, but I couldn't place him at all; you know I never
can remember names, it's such a nuisance," he added, in a tone of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"M. Legrandin."</p>
<p>"Oh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I'm not
mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a
Grandin de l'Eprevier."</p>
<p>"No," replied Mme. de Villeparisis, "no relation at all. These
are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they'd be
only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This
one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer."</p>
<p>"Why, Basin, you know quite well who' my aunt means," cried
the Duchess indignantly. "He's the brother of that great
graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call
on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should
go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw
a person I didn't know come browsing into the room looking
exactly like a cow."</p>
<p>"Listen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home;
I couldn't very well be rude to her; and besides, you do
exaggerate so, she's not in the least like a cow," he added in a
plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the
audience.</p>
<p>He knew that his wife's lively wit needed the stimulus of
contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests
that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a
cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her
original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most
brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped
her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in
a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card
player.</p>
<p>"I admit she doesn't look like <i>a</i> cow, she looks like a
dozen," exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. "I assure you, I didn't
know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my
drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half
a mind to say: 'Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a
mistake, you can't possibly know me, because you're a herd of
cattle,' but after racking my brains over her I came to the
conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea
who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather
bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: 'Your
Royal Highness' and using the third person to a herd of cattle.
The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of
Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long
range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I
don't know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I
used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the
tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn't think what they
were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but
'Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer' with some address or other
which I've forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever
take me there."</p>
<p>"But it's a great distinction to look like a Queen," said the
historian of the Fronde.</p>
<p>"Gad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don't amount to
much," said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be
thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to
attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he
valued highly.</p>
<p>Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and
came towards us.</p>
<p>"Well, sir," asked Mme. de Villeparisis, "have you been
talking to him about the Dreyfus case?"</p>
<p>M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a
smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of
the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit.
Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the
terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing.
As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had
confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent
anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador's geniality, his air of tacit
admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting
that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to
join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered
Bloch's vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important
points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed
implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what
opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them
together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious
unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in
that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having
spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch's literary
work.</p>
<p>"You are not of your age," the former Ambassador told him,
"and I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in
which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer
the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such
as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a
Government."</p>
<p>Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone
amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been
glad of details, would have liked to know what were the
ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the
feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of
others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He
returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating
M. de Norpois's own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the
officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers
at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians
who were involved also, because they were not, like the
politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb,
emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a
religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and
disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a
swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his
acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola
trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the
court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as
though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of
routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the
emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would
come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court
that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse
himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a
restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with
whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day's
proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious
tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and
exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval
for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the
two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the
ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose
life it has had to imagine. To Bloch's questions M. de Norpois
replied:</p>
<p>"There are two officers involved in the case now being tried
of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose
judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both
highly&mdash;I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart."</p>
<p>"But," exclaimed Bloch, "the divine Athena, daughter of Zeus,
has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of
the other. And they are fighting against one another like two
lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but
his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The
sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he
will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds
that wax fat upon the bodies of men."</p>
<p>M. de Norpois made no reply.</p>
<p>"What are those two palavering about over there?" M. de
Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois
and Bloch.</p>
<p>"The Dreyfus case."</p>
<p>"The devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot
supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew
Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of
his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular
hue and cry. And as he's coming up for election next
week.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>"Of course," broke in the Duchess, "if they're all like
Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent
back to Jerusalem."</p>
<p>"Indeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of
thinking," put in M. d'Argencourt.</p>
<p>The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her.
Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he
was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed
with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to
him, and a good talker when he is not listened to, he stopped
short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone
feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"What makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and
Jerusalem? It's nothing to do with that. But," he went on in a
gentler tone, "you will agree that if one of our family were to
be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was
chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What
can you expect, my dear, it's got 'em on the raw, those fellows;
they're all over it. I don't blame them, either; personally, you
know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing
seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times;
but damn it all, when one goes by the name of 'Marquis de
Saint-Loup' one isn't a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?"</p>
<p>M. de Guermantes uttered the words: "When one goes by the name
of Marquis de Saint-Loup," with some emphasis. He knew very well
that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de
Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate
if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over
all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as
the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each
of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance,
what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern
perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to
ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those
of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one
being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our
mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de
Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he
wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest
little tradesman, who would have said: "When one goes by the name
of Duc de Guermantes," whereas an educated man, a Swann, a
Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy
of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and
pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet
'aristocratic' be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had
been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes
had picked up 'when one goes by the name,' he had probably not
the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to
time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing
more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how,
spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which
introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of
which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway
embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on
the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to
use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say,
referring to himself, that "the most charming people, the most
brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that
there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent,
pleasant, whom they could not do without&mdash;namely Bloch," and
heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did
not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names
for his, so I was often to hear this 'when one goes by the
name.'</p>
<p>"What can one expect," the Duke went on, "with the influence
he's come under; it's easy to understand."</p>
<p>"Still it is rather comic," suggested the Duchess, "when you
think of his mother's attitude, how she bores us to tears with
her Patrie Française, morning, noon and night."</p>
<p>"Yes, but there's not only his mother to be thought of, you
can't humbug us like that. There's a damsel, too, a fly-by-night
of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his
mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She
has passed on her state of mind to Robert."</p>
<p>"You may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to
describe that sort of mind," said the librarian, who was
Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. "They say
'mentality.' It means exactly the same thing, but it has this
advantage that nobody knows what you're talking about. It is the
very latest expression just now, the 'last word' as people say."
Meanwhile, having heard Bloch's name, he was watching him
question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as
strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling
before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in
his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out
that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to
the 'Syndicate.'</p>
<p>"Indeed," said the Duke, "'mentality,' you say; I must make a
note of that; I shall use it some day." This was no figure of
speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such
'references' which he used to consult before dinner-parties. "I
like 'mentality.' There are a lot of new words like that which
people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read
somewhere the other day that some writer was 'talentuous.' You
may perhaps know what it means; I don't. And since then I've
never come across the word again."</p>
<p>"But 'mentality' is more widely used than 'talentuous,'" the
historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. "I am
on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard
it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and
indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier's."</p>
<p>"I, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of
Education," replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a
vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in
a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance
sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor
historian blush, "I who have not the honour to belong to the
Ministry of Education," he repeated, relishing the sound of his
words, "nor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and
the Jockey&mdash;you aren't in the Jockey, I think, sir?" he
asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting
an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every
limb), "I, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile
Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard 'mentality.' I'm
sure you're in the same boat, Argencourt.</p>
<p>"You know," he went on, "why they can't produce the proofs of
Dreyfus's guilt. Apparently it's because the War Minister's wife
was his mistress, that's what people are saying."</p>
<p>"Ah! I thought it was the Prime Minister's wife," said M.
d'Argencourt.</p>
<p>"I think you're all equally tiresome about this wretched
case," said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social
sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself
to be led by anyone. "It can't make any difference to me, so far
as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don't
know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of
blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly
intolerable that just because they're supposed to hold 'sound'
views and don't deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have 'Down with
the Jews' printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of
Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known
but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or
Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It
used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one
has spent one's life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they're
against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can
be."</p>
<p>"No; it was the War Minister's wife; at least, that's the
bedside rumour," went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his
conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of
the old school. "Personally, of course, as everyone knows, I take
just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like
him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine,
and I shouldn't care two straws what anybody thought; still after
all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of
Saint-Loup one doesn't amuse oneself by running clean against the
rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or
even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to
call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up
for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that
little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect
she told him that he would be classed among the 'intellectuals.'
The intellectuals, they're the very cream of those gentry. It's
given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very
naughty one."</p>
<p>And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife's and
M. d'Argencourt's benefit, "Mater Semita," which had already made
its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the
world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling
it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent
branch, is still a joke.</p>
<p>"We might ask this gentleman, who has a <i>nerudite</i> air,
to explain it to us," he went on, indicating the historian. "But
it is better not to repeat it, especially as there's not a
vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my
cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her
family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake
to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our
family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the
fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew's highly original views
are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially
as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the
election; you know how he likes to make nuisances," concluded the
Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of
certain phrases, and supposed 'making nuisances' to mean 'making
difficulties.'</p>
<p>Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart.</p>
<p>"There can be no two opinions;" replied M. de Norpois, "his
evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining
this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one
of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let
the Colonel speak. One can't dance lightly out of a blind alley
like that, or if one does there's always the risk of falling into
a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at
the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him,
looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court
and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen
and what he had deduced, and say: 'On my honour as a soldier'"
(here M. de Norpois's voice shook with a faint patriotic throb)
"'such is my conviction,' it is impossible to deny that the
impression he made was profound."</p>
<p>"There; he is a Dreyfusard, there's not the least doubt of
it," thought Bloch.</p>
<p>"But where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had
managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar,
Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had
only one answer to make," (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate
his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) "when one
listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in
the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him
in a tone that admitted of no response: 'Colonel, sir, you know
very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this
moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,' the wind changed; M.
Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings;
he made a complete fiasco."</p>
<p>"No; evidently he's an anti-Dreyfusard; it's quite obvious,"
said Bloch to himself. "But if he considers Picquart a traitor
and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote
them as if he found them charming and believed them to be
sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man
easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying
when he was confronted with Gribelin?"</p>
<p>"In any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent," the Duchess
broke in, "he hasn't done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving
letters he writes from that island. I don't know whether M.
Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his
choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can't be very
pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them
there's no way of exchanging innocents." Everybody laughed. "You
heard what Oriane said?" the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly
of e. de Villeparisis. "Yes; I think it most amusing." This was
not enough for the Duke. "Well, I don't know, I can't say that I
thought it amusing; or rather it doesn't make the slightest
difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don't care
about wit." M. d'Argencourt protested. "It is probably because
I've been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to
brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there
to value, more than anything, logic. That's probably why they
didn't elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold." "Basin,
don't play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite
well that no one admires wit more than you do." "Please let me
finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of
humour, that I am often struck by my wife's wit. For you will
find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons
like a man; she states her case like a writer."</p>
<p>Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois's speaking in this
way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain
in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that,
finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its
enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object
to which he devoted himself in politics was something more
profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism
appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the
attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign
policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political
wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure,
of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact
as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems
of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see
danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he
preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made
a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been
less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of
mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to
the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to
any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as
to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois
knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of
all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in
politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most
luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that
it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a
material form, in the secret files of the President of the
Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their
Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of
written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value
than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the
patient's disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a
matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material
for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the
doctor's reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole
and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in
politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that
one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to
confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an
event occurred as Henry's confession, followed by his suicide,
this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the
Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had
themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the
examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers
themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only
from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played
by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set
seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning
that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a
theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to
their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de
Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de
Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort,
it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had
occurred.</p>
<p>"You may be quite sure that the War Minister must (<i>in
petto</i> at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the
infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to
my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses
himself very bluntly on the matter <i>inter pocula</i>. There are
certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to
create an agitation over which one cannot retain control
afterwards."</p>
<p>"But those documents are obviously forged," put in Bloch.</p>
<p>M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did
not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince
Henri d'Orléans.</p>
<p>"Besides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and
encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view,
would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the
anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate,
either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who
instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to
make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South
American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a
military pronunciamento."</p>
<p>Bloch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus's
guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the
civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois
seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this
judgment.</p>
<p>"If it is a conviction," he said, "it will probably be
quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been
such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the
procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince
Henri's outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his
father's approval."</p>
<p>"You think Chartres is for Dreyfus?" asked the Duchess with a
smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in
her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised.</p>
<p>"Not at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole
family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in
the admirable Princesse Clémentine, carried to its highest power,
and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless
inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria
clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom."</p>
<p>"He would have preferred a private soldier," murmured Mme. de
Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the
Prince de Joinville's, and had said to him once, when he asked if
she was not envious: "Yes, Sir, of your bracelets."</p>
<p>"You aren't going to Mme. de Sagan's ball this evening?" M. de
Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation
with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador,
who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking
no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch's speech of the
neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: "He is
rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old
fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with 'The
Learned Sisters,' like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It
has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it
was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were
inclined to be romantic." But however exceptional his companion
may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the
conversation had lasted long enough.</p>
<p>"No, sir, I don't go to balls any more," she replied with a
charming grandmotherly smile. "You're going, all of you, I
suppose? You're the right age for that sort of thing," she added,
embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Châtellerault, his
friend and Bloch. "Still, I was asked," she went on, pretending,
just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. "In fact, they
came specially to ask me." ('They' being the Princesse de
Sagan.)</p>
<p>"I haven't had a card," said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de
Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that
Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a
woman whom she had called in person to invite.</p>
<p>The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point,
for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and,
with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call
again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say
that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which
was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme.
de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there.</p>
<p>"Aren't they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these
Sagans?" he inquired in a tone of sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Not at all, they're the best we can do for you in that line,"
M. d'Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian
society, assured him.</p>
<p>"Then," said Bloch, still half in irony, "I suppose it's one
of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season."</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes.</p>
<p>"Tell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan's
ball?"</p>
<p>"It's no good asking me," answered the Duchess, "I have never
yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides,
society isn't my strong point."</p>
<p>"Indeed; I thought it was just the other way," said Bloch, who
supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously.</p>
<p>He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him
with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared
that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du
Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not
been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation,
which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial
inquiry.</p>
<p>"I know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head
on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the
prisoner from the Devil's Isle. But I think that we are not yet
reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM.
Gérault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an
utter mystery, I don't say that on one side just as much as on
the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed
up. That certain of your client's more or less disinterested
protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to
deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things," he
added, with a look of great subtlety. "It is essential that the
Government should give the impression that they are not in the
hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to
surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some
pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same
thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh
evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what
follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to
force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak
with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is
their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer
be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will
be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit,
in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of
thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the
words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel,
which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree,
there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the
machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have
ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your
duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take
your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic
appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear
but to answer: 'Present!'?"</p>
<p>M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence
which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the
Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole
party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of
that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which
it would adopt. "Should you fail to disarm," M. de Norpois went
on, without waiting for Bloch's collective answer, "should you,
before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh
trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of
command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in
a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the <i>ultima
ratio</i> of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn
your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you
the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them
pledges?" Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave
him no time. "If the negative be true, as I should like to think,
and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably
lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely
political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court
assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the
fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do
not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get
away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of
them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on
fire.</p>
<p>"It stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government
that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the
list&mdash;already too long&mdash;of unpunished crimes, not
certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any
obscure military mouthpiece," he added, looking Bloch boldly in
the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives
to establish support for themselves in the enemy's camp.
"Government action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder,
from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank
heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end
of the scale, under M. Clemenceau's. We must curb the
professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads
again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to
be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can
be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten
public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend
Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it
would be as well to point out to them that the water in question
was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency
not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking
in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the
impression that they are emerging from their passivity in
self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially
their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in
motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is
proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of
an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with
freedom."</p>
<p>"You, sir," said Bloch, turning to M. d'Argencourt, to whom he
had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that
gentleman's arrival, "you are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all
are, abroad."</p>
<p>"It is a question that concerns only the French themselves,
don't you think?" replied M. d'Argencourt with that peculiar form
of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an
opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold
since he has just expressed one directly its opposite.</p>
<p>Bloch coloured; M. d'Argencourt smiled, looking round the
room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest
of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch's expense, it
became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on
the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for
annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those
words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured
something to M. d'Argencourt which I could not hear, but which
must have referred to Bloch's religion, for there flitted at that
moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which
one's fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking
gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended
with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a
group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be
fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc
de Châtellerault. "You, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware
that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone
pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad.
Anyhow, I know I can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so."
But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against
Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing
a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of
collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus,
replied: "You must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case
with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention
except to Japhetics." Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he
was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his
Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from
somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams
(doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the
internal machine brought to Bloch's lips something quite
different. And we caught only: "But how on earth did you know?
Who told you?" as though he had been the son of a convict.
Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound,
and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of
mind.</p>
<p>What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied
him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de
Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de
Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a
Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the
social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she
ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked
himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the
Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to
repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put
to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might
be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to
give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she
went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without
any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet's article
in the <i>Petit Journal</i>). She decided, therefore, to make it
plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had
no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene
by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does
not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that
people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried
in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague
somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though
charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch's farewell, barely
pencilling on the Marquise's face a languid smile, drew from her
not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch
in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of
spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without
disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand
which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at
her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while
still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian
and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to
provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her
eyelids droop over her closing eyes.</p>
<p>"I believe she's asleep," said Bloch to the librarian who,
feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an
indignant air. "Good-bye madame," snouted Bloch.</p>
<p>The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying
woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer
recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored
vitality, to M. d'Argencourt, while Bloch left the room,
convinced that she must be 'soft' in the head. Full of curiosity
and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an
incident, he came to see her again a few days later. She received
him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured
woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in
mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her,
and finally because she had acted once and for all the little
scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene
that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening
in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already
ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth.</p>
<p>"You were speaking just now of the <i>Seven Princesses</i>,
Duchess; you know (not that it's anything to be proud of) that
the author of that&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;that
production is a compatriot of mine," said M. d'Argencourt with a
fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone
else in the room about the author of a work which had been under
discussion. "Yes, he's a Belgian, by nationality," he went
on.</p>
<p>"Indeed! No, we don't accuse you of any responsibility for the
<i>Seven Princesses</i>. Fortunately for yourself and your
compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know
several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined
to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of
others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same
language as the author of the <i>Seven Princesses</i>. Besides,
if you want to know, it's not worth talking about, because really
there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people
who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make
themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an
idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may
tell you that I'm not in the least afraid of a little daring,"
she added in a serious tone, "provided that there is some idea in
it. I don't know if you've seen Borelli's piece. Some people seem
to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me
through the streets for saying it," she went on, without stopping
to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, "I
found it immensely interesting. But the <i>Seven Princesses</i>!
It's all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew,
I cannot carry family feeling
quite.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the
Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert's mother. Mme. de Marsantes was
regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a
goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had
been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised,
not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc
de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I
have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised,
venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had
flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal,
debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely
alike in features as were the Duc de Guermantes and Mme. de
Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common,
the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between
good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that,
expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind,
or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard.</p>
<p>Mme. de Marsantes attended Brunetière's lectures. She
fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life,
edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose
and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de
Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her
brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her
being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy
life and won everyone's sympathy, could make a person be so
different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances,
where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of
wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less
unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost
exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was
unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct,
out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and
clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a
saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a
gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood
out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was
because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de
Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying
calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in
mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the
frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the
superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes
had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of
time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for
anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month
following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me,
both because I was Robert's friend and because I did not move in
the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a
pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of
the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her
like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up
too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness,
as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not,
however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing
very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever
losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de
Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever
she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte
or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full
value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation
peculiar to the Guermantes: "I have had the <i>honour</i>, the
great <i>hon-</i>our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte," or "of making
the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir" whether that her hearers
might marvel at her humility or from the same tendency that Mme.
de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a
protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which
people never professed themselves sufficiently 'honoured.'
Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme.
de Marsantes said: "I have had the <i>honour</i>, the great
<i>hon-</i>our," she felt she was playing an important part and
shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as
she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the
country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the
other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was
devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of
explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear
the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any
desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk
about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers)
referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a
failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself
could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided
as a sign of stupidity.</p>
<p>In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that
she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood
into which for many generations there had flowed only what was
greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner
everything that the lower orders call 'manners,' and had given
her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor
woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the
castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect
Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for
Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is
to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a
pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because
simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that
you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are
very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of
my meeting her: "You saw of course that she must have been lovely
as a young woman." But true beauty is so individual, so novel
always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to
myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue
eyes, a long neck and a sad expression.</p>
<p>"Listen," said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de
Guermantes, "I'm expecting a woman at any moment whom you don't
wish to know. I thought I'd better warn you, to avoid any
unpleasantness. But you needn't be afraid, I shall never have her
here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It's
Swann's wife."</p>
<p>Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had
begun to assume, and fearing that her husband's racial origin
might be used against herself, had besought him never again to
allude to the prisoner's innocence. When he was not present she
went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in
doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin,
in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had
awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this
attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women's
leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society,
and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the
aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following
their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of
Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he
had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we
shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature
of the Duchess, who held that she was not 'bound to' do things,
and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her
social 'free will,' which was extremely arbitrary.</p>
<p>"Thank you for telling me," said the Duchess. "It would indeed
be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to
get away in time."</p>
<p>"I assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent
woman," said Mme. de Marsantes.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself
of it."</p>
<p>"Have you been invited to Lady Israels's?" Mme. de
Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation.</p>
<p>"Why, thank heaven, I don't know the woman," replied Mme. de
Guermantes. "You must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never
could make out why."</p>
<p>"I did indeed know her at one time," said Mme. de Marsantes.
"I confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any
more. It seems she's one of the very worst of them, and makes no
attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting,
too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again.
While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own
flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to
Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I've no
right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool,
he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine," she
went on, having caught some allusion by M. d'Argencourt to
Robert. "But, talking of Robert, haven't you seen him?" she asked
Mme. de Villeparisis; "being Saturday, I thought he'd be coming
to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a
visit."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son
would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he
did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis,
she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him
in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt
for all the visits that he had failed to pay her.</p>
<p>"Robert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I
don't think I've seen him since Balbec."</p>
<p>"He is so busy; he has so much to do," pleaded Mme. de
Marsantes.</p>
<p>A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes's eyelashes quiver as
she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she
was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly
unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the
cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law's behalf.
The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection,
and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert's pranks. At this
point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the
room.</p>
<p>"Well, talk of the Saint!" said Mme. de Guermantes.</p>
<p>Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen
her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly
bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her
body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on
Robert eyes big astonishment.</p>
<p>"What! You've come! How delightful! What a surprise!"</p>
<p>"Ah! <i>Talk of the Saint</i>!&mdash;I see," cried the Belgian
diplomat, with a shout of laughter.</p>
<p>"Delicious, ain't it?" came tartly from the Duchess, who hated
puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making
fun of herself.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Robert," she said, "I believe he's forgotten
his aunt."</p>
<p>They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as
Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes
turned to me:</p>
<p>"Good afternoon; how are you?" was her greeting.</p>
<p>She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze,
hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the
stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly
backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground
and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she
acted under the fire of Saint-Loup's eyes, which kept her under
observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some
further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our
conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate
it, and answered for me:</p>
<p>"He's not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he
would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more
often, for I can't help telling you that he admires you
immensely."</p>
<p>"Oh, but that's very nice of him," said Mme. de Guermantes in
a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. "I
am most flattered."</p>
<p>"Look, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my
chair," said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his
aunt.</p>
<p>We were both silent.</p>
<p>"I see you sometimes in the morning," she said, as though she
were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part
had never seen her. "It's so good for one, a walk."</p>
<p>"Oriane," began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, "you said you
were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferréol's; would you be so very
kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at
home now that I've got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly
like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them
to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes.
'Corona,' they're called. I've none in the house."</p>
<p>Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de
Saint-Ferréol.</p>
<p>"Who in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferréol?" he inquired, in a
surprised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance
of everything to do with society.</p>
<p>"But, my dear boy, you know quite well," said his mother.
"She's Vermandois's sister. It was she gave you that nice
billiard table you liked so much."</p>
<p>"What, she's Vermandois's sister, I had no idea of that.
Really, my family are amazing," he went on, turning so as to
include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch's
intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, "they know the most
unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferréol" (emphasising the
final consonant of each word) "and names like that; they go to
balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence.
It's prodigious."</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp
sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning
thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of
kinship imposed on her to her nephew's wit. A servant came in to
say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent
word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting.</p>
<p>"Bring him in, sir," said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old
Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister.</p>
<p>"Stop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of
the Empress Charlotte?"</p>
<p>"Why, I'm sure he'll be delighted," said the Ambassador in a
tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate
Minister the favour that was in store for him.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know he's very <i>sound</i>," said Mme. de Marsantes,
"and that is so rare among foreigners. But I've found out all
about him. He is anti-semitism personified."</p>
<p>The Prince's name preserved in the boldness with which its
opening syllables were&mdash;to borrow an expression from
music&mdash;attacked, and in the stammering repetition that
scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy
delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over
the 'heim' of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light
of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings
of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the
several names of which it was composed, that of a little German
watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my
grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of
Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the
Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous
names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And
so, scarcely had I heard the Prince's name spoken than, before I
had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to
shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little
place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth,
picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that
was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in
explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and
I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on
which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go
in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away
that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it.
And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord
extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the
enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close
together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the
Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a
dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the
light of the six-o'clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the
Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For
I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the
forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the
enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished
memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping
five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a
box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the 'Tuesdays' at the
'Français.' He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard
himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age
who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals,
he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages
it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be
elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and
Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see
Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most
exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the
Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her
acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be
elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a
position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who
seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could
by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was
capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further.
And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were
both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done
everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he
multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian
decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had
had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these
attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the
prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him
his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme
politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and
"take the trouble to come so far out of his way," went himself to
the Prince's residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched
his: "I should like immensely to be your colleague," replied in a
tone of deep emotion: "Ah! I should be most happy!" And no doubt
a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: "Well,
here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because
he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells
me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have
some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn't offer to
vote for me it is because it hasn't occurred to him. He lays so
much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that
larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the
support I want, and that is why he doesn't offer me his; but I
have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say
to him quietly: 'Very well, vote for me, will you?' and he will
be obliged to do it."</p>
<p>But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr.
Cottard would have called 'a fine diplomat' and he knew that M.
de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who
would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he
could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The
Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted,
on his country's behalf instead of, as in the present instance,
his own, many of those conversations in which one knows
beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point
one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in
this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for
this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the
Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his
Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M.
de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: "I realised
that I had gone the wrong way to work." For as soon as he had
returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had
repeated:</p>
<p>"I should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my
colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured
that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting
candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know,
the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything
which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How
often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I
cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the
word 'hidebound' escape me," he added, in an undertone, with a
scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage,
casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue
eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience.
"You understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a
personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which
was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues' ideas
linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course
will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever
to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more
alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become
a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your
success, I should be the first to inform you of it."</p>
<p>"The Cordon was a mistake," thought the Prince; "the
negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he
wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key."</p>
<p>This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in
the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One
may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the
Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official
wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But
their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in
the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium
which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest
entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true
determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which
the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of
satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire.
With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested
person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have
understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently
had to deal. Chargé d'Affaires in countries with which we had
been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety
as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well
that it was not by the word 'Peace,' nor by the word 'War' that
it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently
commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the
diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to
which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in
another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the
Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: 'War.'
Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to
that which gave to the first meeting between two young people
promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance
encounter at a performance in the Théâtre du Gymnase, the
dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word
'War' or the word 'Peace' was held, as a rule, not in the
ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the
Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring
to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative
water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour
appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll
which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew
to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a
private matter like this nomination for election to the
Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction
which had served him in his public career, the same method of
reading beneath superimposed symbols.</p>
<p>And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother
and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their
failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing,
the average human being, practising a profession the lines of
which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by
his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed
to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to
'kept' persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden
spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature
in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man
does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to
him: "Don't let's talk about money," the speech must be regarded
as what is called in music 'a silent beat' and that if, later on,
she declares: "You are far too much trouble; you are always
keeping things from me; I've done with you," he must interpret
this as: "Some one else has been offering me more." And yet this
is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed
from the ladies in society. The <i>apache</i> furnishes more
striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if
<i>apaches</i> and their ways were unknown to them, had been
accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are
also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and
cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their
material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that
is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to
fight may spell for a nation the word 'Perish. But inasmuch as
all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books,
the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be
warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of
injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their
ruler, on the advice of his Norpois.</p>
<p>The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he
recovered, but his heart was permanently affected.</p>
<p>"The devil!" he said to himself, "I can't afford to lose any
time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before
they elect me. That really would be unpleasant."</p>
<p>He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years,
an essay for the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, in which he
referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M.
de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He
added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The
Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit
various keys into a stubborn lock: "Still not the right one!"
and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to
the door, thought: "Damn it, these fellows will see me in my
grave before letting me in. We must hurry up."</p>
<p>That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera.</p>
<p>"My dear Ambassador," he began to him, "you told me to-day
that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude;
it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going
to be so indelicate as to take you at your word."</p>
<p>M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince's tact
than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was
not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to
him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to
hear it.</p>
<p>"Well now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two
people to whom I am greatly attached&mdash;in quite different
ways, as you will understand in a moment&mdash;two people both of
whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain
for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are
thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King
and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than
anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their
guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her,
they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did
not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned
just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a
friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life,
and sees only a very few people&mdash;'happy few,' as Stendhal
would say&mdash;but if you were to give me your backing, with the
generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she
would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the
wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she
would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes,
and then (one never knows) if we don't bore her too much, to
spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand
Duchess John's. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de
Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the
frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make
me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the
Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a
regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk."</p>
<p>With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that
the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was
turning.</p>
<p>"Such an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,"
replied M. de Norpois; "nothing is more in harmony with the
Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed
of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise
de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her
dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps
be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and
you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give
up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be
having luncheon, before going on with him to an important
meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu's, without whom nobody can be elected;
I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall
your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He
raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the
support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to
return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly
cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if
you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,"
(here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) "and he knows
that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in
obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong.
Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis's; I will
introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my
conversation with him."</p>
<p>Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call
upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred
when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in
history has features both particular and general which are
stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical
dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an
authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff
differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has
particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the
present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse
in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling
of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition
which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact
that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme.
de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: "Aow to you too,
Matame la Marquise," in the accent of an Alsatian porter.</p>
<p>"Won't you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this
cake; it is so good?" Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to
have shewn herself as friendly as possible. "I do the honours in
this house just as if it was mine," she explained in an ironical
tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though
she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, "you won't
forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the
Academy?"</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular
turn to her wrist to look at the time.</p>
<p>"Gracious! I must fly at once if I'm to get to Mme. de
Saint-Ferréol's, and I'm dining with Mme. Leroi."</p>
<p>And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught
sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at
finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had
been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus's
innocence.</p>
<p>"I don't want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,"
Saint-Loup said to me. "She's an ex-whore. Her husband's a Jew,
and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here's Uncle
Palamède."</p>
<p>The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due
to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I
am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was
to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due
course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de
Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little
expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard
of his existence) of my great-uncle's old servant. This
great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had
died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed
his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of
his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned
from Françoise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle's
memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which
he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to
retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain
for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised
to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen,
dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all
the same, like anything in the world except the son of a
gentleman's servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of
our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic
class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of
satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the
Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his
father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had
set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my
parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest
a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous
actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the
last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which
he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life.
While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he
addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived
from saying 'you' to me as often, and 'sir' as seldom, as
possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never
ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third
person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as:
"To my best friend." One actress, less grateful and more
circumspect than the rest, had written: "To the best of friends,"
which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my
uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was
merely the friend who had done the most little services for her,
the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an
old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his
lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe,
venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never
ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and
boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs
Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some
place in which I might keep them, "How is it," he asked me (in a
tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so
implicit was it in the words themselves), "that I don't see a
single photograph of your uncle in your room?" I felt the blood
rise to my cheeks and stammered: "Why, I don't believe I have
such a thing." "What, you haven't one photograph of your uncle
Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I&mdash;will send you one of
my governor's&mdash;he has quantities of them&mdash;and I hope
you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of
drawers, which came to you from your uncle." It is true that, as
I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room,
there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my
uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel,
who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was
the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a
diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my
uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort
of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an
adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon
discovered that this young man was extremely 'pushing.' Thus at
this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as
well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew
any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He
did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name,
of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly
afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical
admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting
for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would
arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So's. This was
going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking
offence, made no reply.</p>
<p>For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his
ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He
had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien's niece at
work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that
he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt
that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no
hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him
to her, "but not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I
rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a
distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important
it is to make a good impression on tradespeople." Albeit he had
suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he
quite realised,'dear friend,' I might address him, before the
girl, in some such terms as "not dear master, of
course,.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
although.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. well, if you like, dear
distinguished artist," once in the shop, I avoided 'qualifying'
him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself
with reiterating his 'you.' He picked out from several patterns
of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that,
for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat
when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her
two 'apprentices,' but it struck me that the impression had been
mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own
'station' (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly
attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among
the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait
of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles
Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: "I don't suppose you
can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don't see at
what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests
me, because of M. Swann.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "Why, if I
wasn't forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially
to draw your attention to that lady's picture. As a matter of
fact, she was 'lunching' with your uncle the last time you ever
saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It
seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to
see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in
the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on
your uncle again." He broke off with a smile of farewell, across
the courtyard, at Jupien's niece. She was watching him and
admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair
hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking
of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart,
so different were they in my memory, that I should have
henceforth to identify her with the 'Lady in pink.'</p>
<p>M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of
Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and,
contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly
attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he
seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron's
frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some
great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side,
thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is
about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally
with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various
privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of
it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed
the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while
the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the
room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in
repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the
enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity
of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in
other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier
in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated
amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or
concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came
up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his
companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and
without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady.
Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with
whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration
for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be
flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being
compromised by the prettiest woman in the room.</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to
receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious
defects in his aunt's character, was genuinely fond of her. But
every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary
grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any
attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent
abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which
until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other
examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec
brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she
had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to
prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a
thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to
have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand
francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some
trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum
by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in
the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention,
with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had
made when sending the money. "But there was no mistake," replied
Mme. de Villeparisis, "the money order cost six francs
seventy-five." "Oh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all
right," said M. de Charlus, "I mentioned it only in case you
didn't know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same
thing with anyone who didn't know you as well as I do, it might
have led to unpleasantness." "No, no, there was no mistake."
"After all, you were quite right," M. de Charlus concluded
easily, stooping to kiss his aunt's hand. And in fact he bore no
resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her
thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family
matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had
'worked up a regular conspiracy' against him, as she took
shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he
suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a
letter boiling over with insolence and rage. "I shall not be
satisfied with having my revenge," he added as a postscript; "I
shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall
tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs
seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I
lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly." Instead of so doing, he
had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having
already regretted a letter in which he had used some really
terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have
told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance
but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep
silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while
still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without
any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of
indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de
Villeparisis's knowledge. With the result that, having learned
from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public
a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she
had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her
from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her.
This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what
opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of
intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a
different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a
different order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall
presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In
spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we
hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are
in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally
fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce
between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and
will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence
all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom
we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him
once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our
surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time,
between nations.</p>
<p>"I say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!"
remarked Saint-Loup. "And look at Mamma in the innocence of her
heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are
pure, I suppose!"</p>
<p>I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye,
the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the
red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three
mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not
ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of
recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my
direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated
some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak
floated actually over the Baron's knee, his roving eye, like that
of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the 'tecs' to
appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken
note of all the people who were in it. M. de Châtellerault came
up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus's
face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually
standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous
gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously
on show a smile without any definite direction or particular
object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals,
found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any
indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was
obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as
she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and
M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I
might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M.
de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not
have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood
before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it
prevented me from approaching by the full length of his
outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an
episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss
of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear
to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of
trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the
anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was
hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers.</p>
<p>"How tired and worried you look," said Mme. de Marsantes to
her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus.</p>
<p>And indeed the expression in Robert's eyes seemed every minute
to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has
touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched
it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was
the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress.</p>
<p>"Never mind," his mother went on, stroking his cheek, "never
mind; it's good to see my little boy again."</p>
<p>But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de
Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in
an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs
massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field
of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having
realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to
come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did
not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my
hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I
asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could
belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the
lining of which a capital 'G' was surmounted by a ducal coronet.
I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of
anyone whose hat this could possibly be.</p>
<p>"What a pleasant man M. de Norpois is," I said to Mme. Swann,
looking at the Ambassador. "It is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says
he's a pest, but.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>"He is quite right," she replied.</p>
<p>Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which
she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the
satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in
this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a
corner.</p>
<p>"I am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant," she began,
"but you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me
indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an 'honest
Injun,' don't you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the
Princesse de Guermantes's; I don't know how it was, but your name
was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them&mdash;it's
all too silly for words, don't go and worry yourself to death
over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well
the mischievous tongue that said it&mdash;that you were a
hypocritical little flatterer."</p>
<p>I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the
discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was,
could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even
more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago
when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to
the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard
of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is
cut off from the 'world,' from the people who have not directly
perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of
infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having
learned by experience that some important utterance which we
eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so
enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all
comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has
found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately
hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that
some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word
never uttered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect
refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever
halting for any obstacle to infinite distances&mdash;in the
present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes&mdash;and succeed
in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we
actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest
neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed
what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another
planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and
behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves,
than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one
point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank
space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that
what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which
we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems
to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a
part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print
which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves
bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering,
indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays.
Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in
it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his
handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their
radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones,
labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of
error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the
portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: "Dromedary resting."
Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it
was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in
the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a
collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while
round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a
rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal
them with the warning: "This is you."</p>
<p>A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell
Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois,
since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no
longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte.
On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann
with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the
woman who was on my mind at the moment.</p>
<p>"Did you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?" I asked
Mme. Swann.</p>
<p>But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met,
the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no
importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark.</p>
<p>"I don't know; I didn't <i>realise</i> her," she replied
sourly, using an expression borrowed from England.</p>
<p>I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not
only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in
contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the
tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give
pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts
that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact
idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de
Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know who' you mean," she replied with an
affectation of contempt, "the daughter of those rich timber
people. I've heard that she's begun to go about quite a lot
lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to
make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such
delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme.
Lerol would be any addition to what I already have." Mme. de
Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise,
presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M.
de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps
he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way
damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was
because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a
foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think
that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion,
perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the
weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his
taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince's honour the old
custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary
if one wished to be presented.</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it
imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing
to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi.</p>
<p>"Am I not right, M. l'Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite
uninteresting, isn't she, quite out of keeping with the people
who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her,
wasn't I?"</p>
<p>Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de
Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of
meaning.</p>
<p>"Sir," went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, "there are
some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a
visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me
that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young
woman's?"</p>
<p>I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois
smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a
remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one
could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost
as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was
prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse
indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Crébillon.</p>
<p>"Many young women's hands would be incapable of doing what I
see there," said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis's
unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen
the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been
exhibited.</p>
<p>"They are of the first order, and indicate, as people say
nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,"
declared M. de Norpois; "I consider, all the same, that they
stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to
recognise the colouring of the flower."</p>
<p>Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit
of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small
circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved
upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people
in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can
make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it
is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression.</p>
<p>"I claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I've lived all
my life among the fields," replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly.
"But," she added graciously, turning to the Prince, "if I did,
when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them
than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a
distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I
met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt
Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane's wife, don't you know?). I
remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting
him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn't
able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and
when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany
book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the
Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book
still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers
which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante
published some of Mme. de Broglie's letters, charming and
affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of
those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman
who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of
religion."</p>
<p>Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and
his mother were.</p>
<p>"You have been good to me," I said, "how can I thank you? Can
we dine together to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with
Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff
with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last
two letters. (At least, he didn't tell me that that was what had
annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly
to me that I simply can't disappoint him. Between ourselves, on
his side at least, I can feel it's a life and death friendship."
Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious
detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection
which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little
power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed
that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise
occupied, a week's silence was at once interpreted by him as
meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that
his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a
writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to
them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him
to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly
sympathetic attitude. "As for being good," went on Saint-Loup,
"you say I have been to you, but I haven't been good at all, my
aunt tells me that it's you who avoid her, that you never said a
word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against
her."</p>
<p>Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech,
our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would
have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes
again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to
put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had
something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she
had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was
not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking
to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I
need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had
been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I
might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her
again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which
I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact,
instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow.</p>
<p>Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with
Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how
fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost
hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being
embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all
day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must
accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded
was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me,
earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch's uncle,
M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he
who had at one time lived at Nice.</p>
<p>"In that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our
marriage," she told me. "My husband used often to speak of him as
an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature."</p>
<p>"To think that for once in his life he wasn't lying! It's
incredible," would have been Bloch's comment.</p>
<p>All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de
Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than
for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it
was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach
him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room,
I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the
first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to
be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and
sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the
theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my
presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by
his mistress without making any rejoinder.</p>
<p>Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm
round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little
flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed
her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller
room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have
supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from
Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a
rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with
alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a
capital 'G' and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little
room he said, without looking at me:</p>
<p>"As I see that you have taken to going into society, you must
do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it's a little
complicated," he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as
if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing
again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me
the means by which it might be realised. "I am very seldom at
home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to
explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you
walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment."</p>
<p>"You'd better take care, sir," I warned him; "you have picked
up the wrong hat by mistake."</p>
<p>"Do you want to stop me taking my own hat?" I assumed, a
similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone
else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as
not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a
difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say
a few words to Saint-Loup. "He is still talking to that idiot the
Duc de Guermantes," I added. "That really is charming; I shall
tell my brother." "Oh! you think that would interest M. de
Charlus?" (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother
must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his
family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.)
"Who has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?" replied the
Baron in an arrogant tone. "Go to Robert."</p>
<p>"I hear," he went on, "that you took part this morning in one
of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him.
You would do well to use your influence with him to make him
realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by
dragging our name in the dirt."</p>
<p>I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon
the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and
Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him
drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to
Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find
an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment,
in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was
heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels
between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is
all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the
woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And
as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to
feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation
from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he
will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him
and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in
fact.</p>
<p>"I've come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of
the necklace," Robert said to me. "Of course, I never meant for a
moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people
don't look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very
hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear
just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with
his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in
trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has
been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything
but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to
make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and
that's not true. And she's so fond of me; what must she be
thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such
charming ways, I simply can't tell you, she has often done the
most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling
now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don't want
to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron's and
get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me
with it, she will admit that she's been in the wrong. Don't you
see, it's the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I
can't bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that's nothing.
But with her&mdash;to say to oneself that she's suffering and not
to be able to form any idea of what she feels&mdash;I think I
shall go mad in a minute&mdash;I'd much rather never see her
again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she
must; that's all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that
concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something
cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller's and then go and ask her to
forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking
of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about
your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that
might settle the whole business. Perhaps," he went on with a
smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a
possibility, "we can all three dine together in the country. But
we can't tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I
shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision
may be irrevocable."</p>
<p>Robert swept me back to his mother.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he said to her. "I've got to go now. I don't know
when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall
write as soon as I know myself."</p>
<p>Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who,
when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of
exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows
which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this
odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to
believe that rudeness to one's own family is the natural
complement to one's ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched
mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house
against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his
presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel
contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once
conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of
this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to
everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature,
and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts.
Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which
Rachel's absence provoked in him brought it about that, for
different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the
sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened
to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which
Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first
entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this
time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she
fastened on him.</p>
<p>"What, Robert, you're going away? Seriously? My little son!
The one day I've seen anything of you!"</p>
<p>And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice
from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire
her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him,
or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an
argument prompted by plain common sense she added:</p>
<p>"You know, it's not at all nice of you."</p>
<p>But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him
that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection,
so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures,
that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were
the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say
an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he
grew angry.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate, but, nice or not, that's how it is."</p>
<p>And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he
felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists
have always the last word; having laid down at the start that
their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in
them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the
more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal
but with those persons who put them under the necessity of
resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be
carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates
all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is
so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause
them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural
instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased
to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep
him.</p>
<p>"I shall leave you here," he said to me, "but you're not to
keep him long, Mamma, because he's got to go somewhere else in a
minute."</p>
<p>I was fully aware that my company could not afford any
pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with
Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these
pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find
some excuse for her son's conduct, less from affection for him
than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first.</p>
<p>"Poor boy," she began, "I am sure I must have hurt him
dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures,
after all he hasn't many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris.
Oh, dear, if he hadn't gone already I should have liked to stop
him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I'm not
vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse
me if I go and look over the staircase?"</p>
<p>I accompanied her there.</p>
<p>"Robert! Robert!" she called. "No; he's gone; we are too
late."</p>
<p>At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to
make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to
make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup
would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family
would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at
an interval of a few hours.</p>
<p>We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was
not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois
that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which
people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an
over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing),
as much as to say: "There now, there's been trouble."</p>
<p>Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid
ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought
not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she
would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he
could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert's
friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she
furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her.
And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able
to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on
people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate
charity. "At this moment," Robert's friends would say to him,
seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested
action on Rachel's part, "at this moment she will be in the
promenade at the Folies-Bergères. She's an enigma, that girl is,
a regular sphinx." After all, how many women who are not
disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with
a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with
their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of
their lovers?</p>
<p>Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his
mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings
compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every
day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these
infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his
confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which
manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social
organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On
one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: "She is an
angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well
die&mdash;and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that
perhaps&mdash;but no, it can never possibly happen." And in the
exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels
he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money
to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of
the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry
than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an
aquarium, the public are saying: "You don't know her? I
congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don't know how
many men. There isn't a worse girl in Paris. She's a common
swindler. And cunning isn't the word!" And perhaps the public are
not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed
the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and
whom she merely attracts says to his friends: "No, no, my dear
fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don't say she
hasn't had an adventure or two in her time, but she's not a woman
one pays, she'd be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With
her it's fifty thousand francs or nothing." Well, he has spent
fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she
(finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has
managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her
for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two
aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults
will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in,
under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious
curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly
respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not
refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of
women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel.</p>
<p>"I blame myself for one thing only," Mme. de Marsantes
murmured in my ear, "and that was my telling him that he wasn't
nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there's no one else
like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him
he wasn't nice to me, I would far rather he'd beaten me, because
I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening,
and he hasn't many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word.
But, Sir, I mustn't keep you, since you're in a hurry."</p>
<p>Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These
sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to
be, to become a great lady once more.</p>
<p>"I have been so <i>interested</i>, so <i>glad</i> to have this
little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!"</p>
<p>And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude,
of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the
keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These
charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her
white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her
business.</p>
<p>"But I am in no hurry," I replied; "besides, I must wait for
M. de Charlus; I am going with him."</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared
to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could
not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck
me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de
Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even
entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with
Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme.
de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke
light-heartedly and at random.</p>
<p>"You're going from here with my nephew Palamède?" she asked
me.</p>
<p>Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression
on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate
terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, "He has asked
me to go home with him," I answered blithely. "I am so glad.
Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I've quite
made up my mind that we're going to be better friends still."</p>
<p>From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown
anxious. "Don't wait for him," she said to me, with a preoccupied
air. "He is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He's certain to have
forgotten what he said to you. You'd much better go, now,
quickly, while his back is turned."</p>
<p>The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have
suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her
insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her
face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not,
myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de
Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that,
thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss
with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de
Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One
would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members,
of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though
they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to
form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my
saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I
could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his
old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it
stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of
Olympian Zeus which Pheidias is said to have cast in solid gold.
Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes
over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an
equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at
his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people's.</p>
<p>As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to
me:</p>
<p>"So this is how you wait for me, is it?"</p>
<p>It was M. de Charlus.</p>
<p>"You don't mind if we go a little way on foot?" he asked
dryly, when we were in the courtyard. "We can walk until I find a
cab that suits me."</p>
<p>"You wished to speak to me about something, Sir?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished
to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far
as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the
starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But
I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age
when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time,
great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the
pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the
pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps
also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear
sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble,
for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be
trouble."</p>
<p>I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This
summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his
liking.</p>
<p>"That sort of politeness means nothing," he rebuked me coldly.
"There is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a
person who is worth one's while. For the best of us, the study of
the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all
mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like
Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim
yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to
treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of
human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That
is the whole question: you must know something about yourself.
Are you worth my trouble or not?"</p>
<p>"I would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of
anxiety to you," I said to him, "but so far as I am concerned you
may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a
very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be
so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help
me."</p>
<p>Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he
thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with
that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at
Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone.</p>
<p>"With the want of consideration common at your age," he told
me, "you are liable to say things at times which would open an
unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the
other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and
makes me want to do a great deal for you."</p>
<p>As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words,
which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de
Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity
which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the
casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the
pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then
to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray
around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day
were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables,
looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers
supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus
immediately dismissed them.</p>
<p>"They're not what I want," he explained to me, "it's all a
question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they're
going in. I hope, Sir," he went on, "that you will not in any way
misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of
the proposal which I am going to make to you."</p>
<p>I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann's,
closer now than at Balbec.</p>
<p>"You have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that
it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom
that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk
about myself, but you may possibly have heard&mdash;it was
alluded to in a leading article in <i>The Times</i>, which made a
considerable impression&mdash;that the Emperor of Austria, who
has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to
insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the
other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte
de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant
with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be
King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was
in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances
which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret
record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at
liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless
acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few
months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect,
what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the
intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain
secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life
to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume
for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of
events that have already occurred, but of the chain of
circumstances." (This was a favourite expression with M. de
Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in
prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate
by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not
specify, and the chain that linked them.) "I could give you an
explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but
of the future." M. de Charlus broke off to question me about
Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to
be listening, in his aunt's drawing-room. And with that ironical
accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed
to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking
mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was
young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him
would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but
for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for
or against Dreyfus. "It is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn
about life," went on M. de Charlus when he had finished
questioning me, "to include among your friends an occasional
foreigner." I replied that Bloch was French. "Indeed," said M. de
Charlus, "I took him to be a Jew." His assertion of this
incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more
anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however,
against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his
protest took this form: "I understand the newspapers to say that
Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country&mdash;so I
understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as
I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to
take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is
non-existent, your friend's compatriot would have committed a
crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with
France?" I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews
would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. "Perhaps so, and
I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring
over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their
hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only
natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of
the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps
you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great
festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He
might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical
entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes
taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might
even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a
battle between your friend and his father, in which he would
smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an
amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some
stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his
'haggart') of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and
would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like
exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would
be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel." As he poured
out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed
my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family
had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose
Molièresque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself
that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between
goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might
be, would be an interesting subject for research.</p>
<p>I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while
as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a
sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de
Charlus seemed annoyed. "That," he said, "is a woman who made a
great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue
is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any
case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are
trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an
honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to
be amused by their sports." At this point I caught sight of M.
Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to
meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to
M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which
my words were to let loose. "Introduce him to me! But you must
have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get
to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the
awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the
introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the
most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which
I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a
few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that
he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might
go so far as to express my satisfaction." As it happened, M.
Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme.
Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very
favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days
at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young
Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism,
like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted
M. Bloch to her feet. My father's friend had found Mme. Sazerat
charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of
the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her
faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as
enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to
pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him
stolidly: "M. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists
in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful
promiscuity!" "Bernard," he had said with pride, on reaching
home, to M. Nissim Bernard, "you know, she has that prejudice!"
But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to
heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the
Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown
mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which
the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a
pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously
grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. "All this Dreyfus
business," went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, "has
only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite
society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory
epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelries and
Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses
of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Française,
or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political
opinion entitled one to any social qualification." This frivolity
in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse
de Guermantes.</p>
<p>I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think
that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the
Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me
with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I
should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling
incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his
excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me.</p>
<p>"Let us return to yourself," he said, "and my plans for you.
There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I
cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the
reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these
are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious
matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You
remember the story of the man who believed that he had the
Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity.
He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became
merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure
because they alone protect us from others that are more serious.
A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not
digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach
treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor
(another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell
you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was
nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat
whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion
would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the
stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a
time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good
old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged
him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but
his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over
people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become
what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel
had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing
of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish,
do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a
great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great.
It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest
me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes
of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul
that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I
have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some
day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the
most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have
young relatives who are not&mdash;I do not say worthy, but who
are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have
been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it
is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise
to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in
teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a
taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real
interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can
tell I must see you often, very often, every day."</p>
<p>I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness
on M. de Charlus's part to ask him whether he could not arrange
for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm
violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de
Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although
as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions
he had only just caught sight of M. d'Argencourt, who was coming
towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d'Argencourt
appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look
intended for a creature of another race than one's own with which
Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But
one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him
that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he
called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no
importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d'Argencourt had not
recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great
friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of
Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old
friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her
grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her.
Nevertheless I observed that M. d'Argencourt, albeit I had barely
been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis's, and M. de
Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family,
was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon;
and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met.
He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of
friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive
repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment's hesitation, he
held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew.</p>
<p>"I am sorry about that," said M. de Charlus. "That fellow
Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a
diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like
a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of
understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in
life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be
one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you
will honour me by keeping it&mdash;as I shall&mdash;well clear of
the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or
clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem
to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in
which most of the men one meets have been cast."</p>
<p>"The Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were
talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears
that she is specially well informed on that subject."</p>
<p>"She is nothing of the sort," replied M. de Charlus tartly.
"Women, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what
I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who
imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac's novels,
when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could
at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter
going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going
to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice
that you must make for me&mdash;I shall claim them from you in
proportion to the gifts I bestow on you&mdash;is to give up going
into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that
idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but
for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family
visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it
amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it
may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how
invaluable I can be to you. The 'Open Sesame' to the Guermantes
house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the
doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend
to remain master of the situation."</p>
<p>I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had
said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out
what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question
took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him
instead what the Villeparisis family was.</p>
<p>"That is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody
family was," replied M. de Charlus. "My aunt married, for love, a
M. Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose
sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards
he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to
anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What
his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a
'Monsieur de Villeparisis,' a gentleman born at Villeparisis,
which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My
aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the
family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can't
tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it
is better not to copy the regular forms."</p>
<p>Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the
fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the
composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a
woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be
able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of
similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships
with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I
had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing
aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered
round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be
charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent
me little presents from time to time. But I had never any
impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and
if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one
of the last people to whom I should have applied.</p>
<p>"At present," went on M. de Charlus, "by going into society,
you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and
character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing
your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection,
that doesn't concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young
rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving," he
rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. "But the choice of
your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men
are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an
injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my
nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a
pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no
possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really
when all's said and done, as a person to go about with, at times
when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any
serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one
of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who
look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their
innocent victims to the gallows." I did not know the meaning of
this slang word 'renter'; anyone who had known it would have been
as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in
society always like talking slang, and people against whom
certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not
afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But
they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer
capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will
become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of
corruption than of simplicity. "He is not like the rest of them;
he has nice manners; he is really serious."</p>
<p>I could not help smiling at this epithet 'serious,' to which
the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the
sense of 'virtuous,' of 'steady,' as one says of a little
shop-girl that she is 'serious.' At this moment a cab passed,
zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his
box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the
cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped
him. The driver began to argue.</p>
<p>"Which way are you going?"</p>
<p>"Yours." This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already
refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't want to get up on the box. D'you mind if I stay
down here?"</p>
<p>"No; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my
proposal," said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, "I give you
a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall
need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of
loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I
must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so
often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them
again. Damn it, it's the least you can expect that before giving
up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass.
Very well, bear in mind what I'm offering you; you are like
Hercules' (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear
to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of
the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having
chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!" he turned to the
cabman, "haven't you put the hood down? I'll do it myself. I
think, too, I'd better drive, seeing the state you appear to be
in."</p>
<p>He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse
trotted off.</p>
<p>As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I
found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged
that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another
form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our
butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes', who was an
anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in
conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival
Leagues, the Patrie Française and the Droits de l'Homme, were
fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M.
Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he
had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply
presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory
which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for
rational policy (a victory against France, according to some)
that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot
by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top
to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him,
ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist
manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry.
When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the
most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis,
by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple
affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order
may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason.
Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to
choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had
been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more
freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed
for itself. The case of the Guermantes' butler and our own was
peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and
anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on
the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted
were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a
conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case
announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false,
but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from
the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there
came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid
apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers
whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the
rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the
Guermantes' butler that he was innocent. This was done not to
conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the
keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether
the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event
of failure, to deprive the Duke's butler of the joy of seeing a
just cause vanquished. The Duke's butler thought that, in the
event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention
on the Devil's Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I
had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of
dissension in the Guermantes household.</p>
<p>I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For
some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had
been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that
we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained
to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has
no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves
understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we
might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if
not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like
discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no
more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we
should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My
grandmother's attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the
attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the
pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain
to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of
which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the
reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain
creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves,
creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have
recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as
when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to
his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our
body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be
appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother,
and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment
we told him that she was ill: "Ill? You're sure it's not what
they call a diplomatic illness?" He tried to soothe his patient's
restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup
gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them
liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet,
Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine
being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes
of medical practitioners, when we summon the wisest of them to
our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific
truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years' time.
So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if
not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this
mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many
truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A
thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was
clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the
foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It
seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother's
mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little
sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found
her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to
move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of
her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my
grandmother's mind could have devoted to herself would have been
incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we
felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the
ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient's
fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it
was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was,
had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day,
scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my
grandmother's lips when almost at once, as though with a single
bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact
that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a
halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed
once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand.
Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray,
she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her
final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to
constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another
creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not
content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge
of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come
into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and
hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my
grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer
in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a
permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence
one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: "Very
well; I have nothing to say; if it's like that you may pass,"
this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly
she seemed to be saying: "What use will that be to you? Since you
are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up,
once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of
telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won't last for
ever. And then you'll be a lot better off." Thereupon my
grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew
the human body better than herself, the presence of a
contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the
presence of earth's first inhabitant&mdash;long anterior to the
creation of thinking man&mdash;she felt that aeonial ally who was
sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the
elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the
prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment
a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent
chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of
kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life,
would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved
by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so
many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of
plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister
momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless
her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has
trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot
pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to
us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but
constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some
persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked
that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my
intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician
who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment
which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves
to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in
us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet
them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not
know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever
anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know
has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent,
of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the
benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who
with an eye more penetrating than other men's perceives the
truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous
diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted
that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. "Ah! I
don't know about that. It's quite possible," put in Françoise,
who was in the room and heard Charcot's name, as she heard du
Boulbon's, for the first time But this in no way prevented her
from saying "It's possible." Her 'possibles,' her 'perhapses,'
her 'I don't knows' were peculiarly irritating at such a moment.
One wanted to say to her: "Naturally you don't know, since you
haven't the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can
you even say whether it's possible or not; you know nothing about
it. Anyhow, you can't say now that you don't know what Charcot
said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you,
and your 'perhapses' and 'possibles' don't come in, because it's
a fact."</p>
<p>In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and
nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician,
a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged
my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear
perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the
day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a
specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was
the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my
grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from
her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de
Sévigné's letter on Mme. de la Fayette: "Everyone said she was
mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong
in their judgment: 'Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!' and I stuck
to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right
not to go out." Du Boulbon when he came decided against&mdash;if
not Mme. de Sévigné, whom we did not quote to him&mdash;my
grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing
on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps
the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his
patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed
spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let
her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or
simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about
Bergotte.</p>
<p>"I should think so, indeed, he's magnificent, you are quite
right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer?
Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it
is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in
it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?"</p>
<p>I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this
about literature because he himself found medicine boring,
perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more
therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew
her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of
her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished
particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had
been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my
grandmother's memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he
began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre
eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth
and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary
rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in
wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel
and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking
down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he
were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet,
impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of
intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this
visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his
bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)</p>
<p>"You will be quite well, Madame, on the day&mdash;when it
comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes
to-day&mdash;on which you realise that there is nothing wrong
with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you
have not been taking your food, not going out?"</p>
<p>"But, Sir, I have a temperature."</p>
<p>He laid a finger on her wrist.</p>
<p>"Not just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don't you
know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous
patients with temperatures of 102?"</p>
<p>"But I have a little albumen as well."</p>
<p>"You ought not to know anything about that. You have what I
have had occasion to call 'mental albumen.' We have all of us
had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases
which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling
our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with
drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing)
they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating
them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent
than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A
belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any
temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell
them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will
begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in
their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is
stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you
imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your
eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I
may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson,
who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with
you?" "Your grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor
allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elysées, near that
laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,"
said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon,
her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference
which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone.
The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as
well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows:
"Go to the Champs-Elysées, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which
your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It
purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was
with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry
into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly
germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the
most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add&mdash;what is of
therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value&mdash;the most
beautiful of antiseptics."</p>
<p>Inasmuch as a great part of what doctors know is taught them
by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge
which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride
themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with
some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the
superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant,
might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local
dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: "Probably a
windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics
would have no effect." "On the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows
I can never sleep at all." But doctors are touchy people. "Ach!"
muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had
trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother's sleeplessness on
stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not,
however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character
as a 'superior' person, he felt himself bound not to put any
faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic
serenity.</p>
<p>My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from
Bergotte's friend, added in support of his verdict that a first
cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint,
had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray,
without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week.</p>
<p>"You see, Madame, I didn't know that, and yet I could have
told you."</p>
<p>"But, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my
doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed," said my
grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the
doctor's theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections
that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute
these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any
doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his
encouraging diagnosis.</p>
<p>"Why, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms
of&mdash;if you'll excuse my saying so&mdash;mania at once; you
have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a
home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a
seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which
must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was
doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a
muscle: 'You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold
very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while
I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels.
If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool
down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.'
Which he would, in fact, have done. 'You're a fine specimen of
neurasthenia, that's what you are,' I told him. And do you know
what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was
this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania
for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine
had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day
on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care
to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the
others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that
it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be
offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not
turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet
of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I
know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that
splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All
the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is
they and they only who have founded religions and created great
works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it
owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order
to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful
pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what
they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears,
spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death
which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have
felt, Madame," he added with a smile at my grandmother, "for
confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very
confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill,
perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you
thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken;
they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering.
There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It
will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of
dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the
cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of
deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient?
No, no; you mustn't think I'm making fun of your sufferings. I
should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them
thoroughly. And, well, they say there's no good confession unless
it's mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there
can be no great artist. What is more," he added, raising a solemn
forefinger, "there can be no great scientist either. I will go
further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous
trouble, he is not, I won't say a good doctor, but I do say the
right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a
doctor who doesn't say too many foolish things is a patient
half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing
verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I,
Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from
albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh
air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at
least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home
where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I
had gone to secure a room, for&mdash;this is between
ourselves&mdash;I spend my holidays there looking after myself
when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the
attempt to cure other people."</p>
<p>"But do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?" came to a
frightened voice from my grandmother.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe
will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very
efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards.
That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves.
Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care
not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there
one of Bergotte's books. Cured of your neurosis you would no
longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute
for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which
would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys
themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No;
I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is
that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must
reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent
you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ
in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and
in distracting you in every possible way. You needn't tell me
that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a
preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have
a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to
anyone, it will be just as if you hadn't it, for your nervous
energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an
expression full of meaning, called 'imaginary health.' See, it
has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed
listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your
eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to
you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the
time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day."</p>
<p>When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to
the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that
had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt
that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would
see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the
coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with
emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little
like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that
somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is
still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and,
bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her
shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now
that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to
exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do
not permit us to put into execution. Françoise annoyed me by her
refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there
had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and
the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in
her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm
to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good
mistress, and that would have been the ideal 'place' if only she
didn't listen to 'stories.'</p>
<p>During the last few days people had begun to hear of my
grandmother's illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup
had written to me: "I do not wish to take advantage of a time
when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far
more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no
concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to
you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy
of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so
scoundrelly a betrayal." But some other friends, supposing that
my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have
known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next
day in the Champs-Elysées, to go with them from there to pay a
call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the
thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to
forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told
that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon's
orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had
herself at once suggested the Champs-Elysées. It would be easy
for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to
arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I
should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with
them to Ville d'Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not
want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du
Boulbon's instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and
to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought
that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous
weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again
would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it
moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken
solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to
the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold.
As Françoise had not had time to send a 'tube' to her daughter,
she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly
consented, however, to call first at Jupien's, to get a stitch
put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear.
Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her
into the shop. "Is it your young master who brings you here,"
Jupien asked Françoise, "is it you who are bringing him to see me
or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?" For all
his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as
instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort,
broke them. With Françoise gone and the cloak mended, it was time
for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to
let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself,
an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be
quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards
our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put
everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to
take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an
appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d'Avray. In
my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her,
after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she
joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for
having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who
has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her
belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door
which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the
liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the
sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls
of the passage.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, if you're going to meet your friends I ought to
have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this
one."</p>
<p>I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having
begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her
dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel,
in the Champs-Elysées, I saw my grandmother, without a word to
me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with
its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for
Françoise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then
was still talking to Françoise's 'Marquise' when, following my
grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her
hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little
rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance,
as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring
and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money
himself for the seats, the 'Marquise,' at the receipt of custom,
was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared
with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and
black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that
she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the
greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed
to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side.</p>
<p>"So you're still here?" he was saying. "You don't think of
retiring?"</p>
<p>"And what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me
where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more
at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there's all the
coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call
it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that's going
on. Just to give you an example, there's one of them who went out
not more than five minutes ago; he's a magistrate, in the very
highest position there is. Very well, Sir," she cried with
ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this
assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew
any sign of challenging its accuracy, "for the last eight years,
do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke
of three he's been here, always polite, never saying one word
louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an
hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There
was one day he didn't come. I never noticed it at the time, but
that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: 'Why, that
gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he's dead!' And that gave me
a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of
people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw
him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: 'I hope
there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?' Then he told me that it
was his wife that had died, and he'd been so put out, poor
gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn't been able
to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when
they've been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting,
but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could
see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I
could to make him feel at home. I said to him: 'Y' mustn't let go
of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a
little distraction for you in your sorrow.'"</p>
<p>The 'Marquise' resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed
that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her
complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping
harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a
horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god.</p>
<p>"And besides," she went on, "I choose my customers, I don't
let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn't
the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such
friendly customers I have; there's always some one or other
brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my
favourite flowers, roses are."</p>
<p>The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because
we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower
made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily
escape&mdash;or of being condemned only by default&mdash;from an
adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always
in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are
most friendly, for the 'Marquise,' thinking that I was bored,
turned to me.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't like me to open a little place for you?"</p>
<p>And, on my declining:</p>
<p>"No? You're sure you won't?" she persisted, smiling. "Well,
just as you please. You're welcome to it, but I know quite well,
not having to pay for a thing won't make you want to do it if you
don't want to."</p>
<p>At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place
who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she
did not belong to the 'Marquise's' world, for the latter, with
the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:</p>
<p>"I've nothing disengaged, Ma'am."</p>
<p>"Will they be long?" asked the poor lady, reddening beneath
the yellow flowers in her hat.</p>
<p>"Well, Ma'am, if you'll take my advice, you'll try somewhere
else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and
I've only one closet; the others are out of order."</p>
<p>"Not much money there," she explained when the other had gone.
"It's not the sort we want here, either; they're not clean, don't
treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that
would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship.
I'm not sorry to lose her penny."</p>
<p>Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably
would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion
that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat,
so as not to have to share in the scorn which the 'Marquise'
would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but
slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to
overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: "I am
afraid I've kept you waiting; I hope you'll still be in time for
your friends," but she did not utter a single word, so much so
that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first;
until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me
she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her
heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully
and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was
crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried
look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just
been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you
feeling better now?" I asked her.</p>
<p>Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her,
without alarming me, not to make some answer.</p>
<p>"I heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper," she
told me. "Could anything have been more typical of the
Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens,
what fine language she put it all in!" And she quoted, with
deliberate application, this sentence from her own special
Marquise, Mme. de Sévigné: "As I listened to them I thought that
they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell."</p>
<p>Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she
had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her
memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would
naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained
possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than
heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she
muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be
accounted for by the fear of being sick again.</p>
<p>"Come!" I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her
illness too seriously, "since your heart is bothering you, shall
we go home now? I don't want to trundle a grandmother with
indigestion about the Champs-Elysées."</p>
<p>"I didn't like to suggest it, because of your friends," she
replied. "Poor boy! But if you don't mind, I think it would be
wiser."</p>
<p>I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she
uttered these words.</p>
<p>"Come!" I said to her sharply, "you mustn't tire yourself
talking; if your heart is bad, it's silly; wait till we get
home."</p>
<p>She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had
realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at
once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke.</p>

<h3><i>CHAPTER ONE [continued]</i></h3>
<h4>[MY GRANDMOTHER'S ILLNESS]</h4>
<p><span class="aa">We made</span> our way back along the Avenue
Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to
rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I
always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most
unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of
the world outside, and, more than from any casual passer-by, I
was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to
say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to
her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly
handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days
of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She
was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions
which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de Sévigné, to our
conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being
without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from
the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have
ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning,
from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my
grandmother would shortly be.</p>
<p>"Well, Sir, I don't like to say no, but you have not made an
appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day
for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I
cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in
for a consultation. It's a question of professional
etiquette.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of
the famous Professor E&mdash;&mdash;, almost a friend of my
father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both,
who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration,
had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that
he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But
he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters,
seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of
speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he
begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a
mania with him.</p>
<p>"But, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you
will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in
a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at
our house in half an hour's time, when I have taken her
home."</p>
<p>"Call at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do
that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to
pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I
have torn my coat and my' other one has no buttonholes for my.
decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the
switches. You don't know how the lift works; one can't be too
careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as
I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at
once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give
her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more."</p>
<p>I had started off at once, without even getting out of the
lift which Professor E&mdash;&mdash; had himself set in motion to
take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did
so.</p>
<p>We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but
when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in
a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it
can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or
may signify that death&mdash;or its first assault and partial
possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us
again&mdash;may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain,
this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to
some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day
so that in a month's time you will have had the full benefit of
the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take,
which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies
before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a
friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine
again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has
been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in
an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all
days to make its appearance, in a few minutes' time, more or
less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the
Champs-Elysées. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the
fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something
reassuring in this kind of death&mdash;in this kind of first
contact with death&mdash;because death thus assumes a known,
familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it,
and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A
drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first
onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all,
several people who could testify that at six o'clock, as we came
home from the Champs-Elysées, they had bowed to her as she drove
past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making
his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us,
stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not
yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had
acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take
offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous,
raised her hand in the air as though to say: "What does it
matter? It is not of the least importance."</p>
<p>Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I
was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in
the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past
in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The
seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an
avenue&mdash;for all that it may be subjected also to certain
conditions of equilibrium&mdash;has no need of energy. But in
order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by
a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces
which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive
(because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly
if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the
pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded
our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left
in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and
death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to
offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush
upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the
shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep
ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but
the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we
wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of
vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting
struggle.</p>
<p>And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished
air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us
then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated
she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging
desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the
downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild,
unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its
pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to
them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown
world somewhere in which she had already received the blows,
traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few
minutes earlier in the Champs-Elysées, her hat, her face, her
cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with
whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of
her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that
indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in
expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal
moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those
lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found
unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of
their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies,
like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do
not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before
killing him, during which time they make haste, like a 'sociable'
neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible
acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as
from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it
imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not
at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before,
when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes
the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going
in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but
from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form
an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no
longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In
the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist,
put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with
avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince
her. Or rather it is not the mistress's part but that of the
servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only
third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we
suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and
although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her
still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she
finally abandons us.</p>
<p>I helped my grandmother into Professor E&mdash;&mdash;'s lift
and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting
room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed,
such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly,
that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my
grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he
devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite
passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He
had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the
light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was
minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the
room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished,
went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end,
repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a
few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have
preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which
completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he
uttered them. I then remembered that M. Fallières, the President
of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and
that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned
a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his
preparations for a more or less remote succession to the
Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother's
prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was
recalling the example of M. Fallières, I was distracted from
following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served
as conclusion to one of the Professor's jokes. After which he
took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that
he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for
his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my
grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to
tell me the truth.</p>
<p>"There is not the slightest hope," he informed me. "It is a
stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not
necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need
not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard,
you're in excellent hands. Excuse me," he broke off as a maid
came into the room with his coat over her arm. "I told you, I'm
dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay
first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think
at your age."</p>
<p>And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door
behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we
heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem
the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten
minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the
landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the
slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for
home.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along
which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we
lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of
horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like
a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived
at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase
in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my
grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an
attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother's
face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet
already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had
been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but
final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as
malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people,
so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was
seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the
brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to
give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when
Françoise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck
in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to
banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother
was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she
heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her
hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a
white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not
catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not
notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my
precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my
grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God,
raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions
in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy
movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch
the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did
she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer's face. Perhaps this
was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the
thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps
from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it.
Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible
to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental
weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able
to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my
grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up
side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother
turning away her eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what
could be made out of my grandmother's altered features, at which
her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze
wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Françoise. Not
that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she
had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness
shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself
weeping into her mother's arms), but she had a certain tendency
always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from
her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually
exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the
want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make
no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful
alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it
would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the
unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the
wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of
chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the
interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh.</p>
<p>When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Françoise, my
grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could
speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a
blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently
been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma
in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments
through which she had yet had to pass.</p>
<p>"Well, my child," she began, taking my mother's hand in one of
her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to
account for the slight difficulty which she still found in
uttering certain words. "So this is all the pity you shew your
mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a
pleasant thing!"</p>
<p>Then for the first time my mother's eyes gazed passionately
into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her
face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises
which we swear but are unable to fulfil:</p>
<p>"Mamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will
see to that."</p>
<p>And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that
her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them,
and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until
it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly,
reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a
sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all
the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she
could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that
she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she
accused Françoise unjustly of not 'doing' her bed properly). By a
convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole
flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered
there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into
a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the
successive deposits of the tide.</p>
<p>My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke
by the obnoxious perspicacity of Françoise) would not even admit
that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an
admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had
any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as
all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had
led me to suppose that Andrée was too sorry for Albertine to be
really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced
in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love
his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost,
commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours.</p>
<p>Françoise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of
doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And
if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the
sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after
she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most
tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the
world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up
with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came
for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her
death agony, still Françoise would have quietly slipped away so
as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her
place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had
brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone's duty
towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our
servants should 'fail' us. This doctrine had made her so noble,
so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never
come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not
speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to
refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come
rushing&mdash;however little they might previously have sought to
oblige&mdash;to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by
carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Françoise had
contracted also&mdash;and had brought with her to Paris&mdash;the
habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her
work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like
receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in
the house without receiving from her any response to their
morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her
bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was
simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work
on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when
my grandmother was so ill Françoise's duties seemed to her
peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the
official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of
these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her,
did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having
copied the butler's example and supplied himself with note-paper
from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from
my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day,
out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so
as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the
letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village.
Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was
little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these
poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of
common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so
that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he
discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from
Lamartine, just as he might have said "Who laughs last, laughs
longest!" or merely "How are you keeping?"</p>
<p>To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine.
Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased
the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked
ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always
wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that
had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint
groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found
no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her.
The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely
succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still
further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour
his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of
albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation,
stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common,
there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in
which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment
presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at
a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who,
vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in
an hour of peril, after a moment's reflexion, decides upon what
is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives
the order: "Advance eastwards." Medically, however little hope
there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it
did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my
grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable;
she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was
difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent,
suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself
familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its
sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in
the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for
everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a
coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third,
more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His
nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one
would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to
attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense
of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense
preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache.
When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink
expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she
thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: "Oh,
it's dreadful!" but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she
employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of
pain, or&mdash;an alternative stratagem&mdash;repeated the same
plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a
different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might
have overheard.</p>
<p>"Oh! My dear, it's dreadful to have to stay in bed on a
beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the
air; I am crying with rage at your orders."</p>
<p>But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes,
the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of
her limbs.</p>
<p>"There is nothing wrong. I'm complaining because I'm not lying
very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I
knocked myself against the wall."</p>
<p>And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that
suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that
pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it,
she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying
it away, my mother said:</p>
<p>"No, no, Mamma dear, we won't let you suffer like that, we
will find something to take it away, have patience just for a
moment; let me give you a kiss, darling&mdash;no, you're not to
move."</p>
<p>And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling
on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would
have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of
herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life
contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over
her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so
sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been
carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother
also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma's. It was so altered
that probably' had she been strong enough to go out, she would
have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her
features, like the clay in a sculptor's hands seemed to be
straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything
else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to
identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and
if my grandmother's face had shrunk in the process it had at the
same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed
those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone.
Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in
breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by
exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive,
seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the
rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian
of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her
resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which
she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction,
entered.</p>
<p>In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does
not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and
sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who
assured us that if we sent for the specialist X&mdash;&mdash; he
would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that
sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe
them just as Françoise always believed the advertisements in the
newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the
colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus's bottle. My
grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And
we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble
for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect
each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter
with any of them. According to him, however, there was;
everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes,
was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To
each of us he said: "I should like to have another look at that
little cornea. Don't put it off too long. I can soon get rid of
it for you with a hot needle." We were, of course, thinking of
something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: "Get rid
of what?" In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his
mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the
following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken
effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street
he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think
that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his
intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already
ill.</p>
<p>My grandmother's illness gave occasion to various people to
manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us
quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of
them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of
friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the
signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at
the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness
which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the
countless painful impressions that we received in my
grandmother's room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to
leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them
excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought
that they could find, better than by the invalid's bedside, food
for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to
say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in
the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal
(the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from
one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and
spent several hours with me.</p>
<p>He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to
the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on
ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk
without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as
long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For
he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my
grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He
grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our
staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it.
Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he
would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of
losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out,
he, the 'man with the little beard' whom I had seen so alert, not
very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was
frequently obstructed.</p>
<p>But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body
of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period
when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to
disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes
of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among
the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only
after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he
still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he
had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the
progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least
be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of
his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the
deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But
for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed
still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving
still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about
him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous
youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day,
to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers.</p>
<p>The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several
years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him
as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth
of his reputation. A man's work seldom becomes completely
understood and successful before that of another writer, still
obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult
to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost
ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I
constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my
eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the
carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen,
not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate
as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had
recently begun to publish work in which the relations between
things were so different from those that connected them for me
that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He
would say, for instance: "The hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep
of the roads" (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly
along those roads) "which started every five minutes from Briand
and Claudel." At that point I ceased to understand, because I had
expected the name of a place and was given that of a person
instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly
constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability
necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth
and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things
in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about
halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later
on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known
as the 'bridge-ladder.' I felt nevertheless for the new writer
the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks
for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And
from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose
limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at
which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it
was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them
at all when it was Renoir.</p>
<p>People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is
one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying
they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of
time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as
a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the
original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines
adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by
their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us.
When it is at an end the operator says to us: "Now look!" And, lo
and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and
for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is
born) appears to us entirely different from the old world, but
perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what
they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types
which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages,
too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to
go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which
when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a
forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but
lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new
and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last
until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new
painter or writer of original talent.</p>
<p>This writer who had taken Bergotte's place in my affections
wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of
associations&mdash;perfectly coherent&mdash;which my mind was not
trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point
that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common
character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover,
when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the
writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of
a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found
long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected
that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of
the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to
produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was
led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the
distinction which we are always making between art, which is no
more advanced now than in Homer's day, and science with its
continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this
respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have
advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how
was I to know that in twenty years' time, when I should be able
to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day,
another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be
packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have
consigned Bergotte?</p>
<p>I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste
for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy
and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had
almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From
that moment my friend's features outlined themselves on the
printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the
effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him
to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that
was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read
scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed
from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they
had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His
reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now
that he had given an independent existence to almost all his
thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a
woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless,
vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore
and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave.
However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I
should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was
so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the
most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to
him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him
come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was
simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to
the house as he might have gone to a café, so that no one should
talk to him, so that he might&mdash;very rarely&mdash;talk
himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that
he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he
enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from
such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my
mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act
of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: "See
that you don't forget to thank him nicely."</p>
<p>We had also&mdash;a discreet feminine attention like the
refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between
sittings, by a painter's mistress&mdash;a courteous supplement to
those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme.
Cottard. She came to offer us her 'waiting-woman,' or, if we
preferred the services of a man, she would 'scour the country'
for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did
hope this was not just a 'put-off on our part, a word which in
her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an
invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred
to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it
had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that
even if this had been true it would have been at once a very
small and a considerable admission on the part of the most
faithless and the most attentive of husbands.</p>
<p>Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the
form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest
intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of
expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of
Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit
to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself
at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months
later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess,
extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who
was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand
Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was
devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his
Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all
marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride's fortune was
the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered
this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had
ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing
passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters
which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother's
illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of
her mother's expressions: "Sévigné would not have put it
better."</p>
<p>On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother's
entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie
down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to
sleep) Françoise to sit quite still and not disturb her by
moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the
room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her
uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as
doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible
attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the
house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which
was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building,
where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien.
This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother's
illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again,
or told to wait. But Franchise's code of manners would not permit
of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this
worthy man; my grandmother's condition ceased at once to matter.
When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and
went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him
on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood
open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on
the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying
goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught
through the house. Françoise tore herself from the workman, not
without turning to shout down after him various greetings,
forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical
Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which
Françoise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly
imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them
an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human
soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by
plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have
a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over
Françoise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most
senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered.
Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite
ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to
war also to help the 'poor Russians,' "since," she reminded us,
"we're allianced to them." She felt this abstention to be not
quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always "said such nice
things about us"; it was a corollary of the same code which would
have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien,
knowing that it would 'upset' her digestion, and which brought it
about that now, with my grandmother lying at death's door, the
same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining
neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in
herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this
good electrician who had been put to so much trouble.</p>
<p>Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Françoise's
daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the
regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the
family of an invalid: "You haven't tried taking him away for a
little.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. the change of air, you
know.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. pick up an
appetite.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. etc?" she had added the
almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own
imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her,
without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it
through the thickness of people's heads: "She ought to have taken
herself in hand <i>radically</i> from the first." She did not
recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were
'radical.' As for Françoise herself, she noticed that we were not
giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her,
they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but
at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of
France, some cousins&mdash;relatively well-to-do&mdash;whose
daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died
at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had
ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages
from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all
this seemed to Françoise, for the parents in question, a kind of
luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the
country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction,
derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish
expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most
precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling
people how they had done as much for her and more than the
richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of
which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had
been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father,
elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of
his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he
had ruined himself. Françoise was not unmoved by this wealth of
scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother's sickbed seemed
to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage
of a small provincial theatre.</p>
<p>There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my
grandmother's eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her
eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained
just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see
nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome
which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had
come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon
and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always
full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points,
because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it,
to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it
to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position
or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it
was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes
which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the
visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance,
giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then
her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering
affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother
was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the
sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in,
all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she
kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement
of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few
days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually
to see sounds, to listen with one's eyes. Finally her pain grew
less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged
to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said.</p>
<p>And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer
understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay
perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of
convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable
to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome
by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the
pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave,
like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or
occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping
her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think.
Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly
trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from
doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One
day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her
standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the
window.</p>
<p>At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had
been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved
perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times
in the mystery&mdash;so obscure, for all that&mdash;of the
organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our
own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so
cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had
deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom.</p>
<p>We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an
almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated
forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret
being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began
laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her
nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her
shoulders.</p>
<p>The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy,
plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the
sullen expression of a doddering old
woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like
her hair done, Françoise managed to persuade herself that the
request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with
brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. "It can't hurt Madame
Amédée," she said to herself, "if I just comb her; nobody's ever
too ill for a good combing." In other words, one was never too
weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to
comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel
hands of Françoise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the
act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of
aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of
the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position
into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a
ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with
spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Françoise would
have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it
by suggesting to her: "That is enough," for fear of her
disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that
my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her
liking, Françoise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I
was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her
in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept
without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face
unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a
moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which
had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled,
distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me.</p>
<p>According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the
congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in
some way.</p>
<p>Cottard was in two minds. Françoise hoped at first that they
were going to apply 'clarified cups.' She looked for the effects
of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference
to it. Even if she had said 'scarified' instead of 'clarified'
she still would not have found any reference to this adjective,
since she did not look any more for it under 'S' than under 'C';
she did indeed say 'clarified' but she wrote (and consequently
assumed that the printed word was) 'esclarified.' Cottard, to her
disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to
leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother's
room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black
serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the
head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless
face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes,
as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of
intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she
could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that
she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time
occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of
treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be
reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of
a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools
of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted
before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm
was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She
realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move,
and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should
know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my
hand.</p>
<p>I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of
certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it
was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring
the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Françoise repeating
to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it
crow: "Oh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame."
This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect,
as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother,
whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not
seem even to hear her.</p>
<p>Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the
congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to
find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill,
Françoise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had
ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her
dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even
the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of
'trying-on.'</p>
<p>A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother
came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that
tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are
crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of
others:</p>
<p>"Forgive me for disturbing your sleep," she said to me.</p>
<p>"I was not asleep," I answered as I awoke.</p>
<p>I said this in good faith. The great modification which the
act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing
us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose
all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our
mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The
tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we
were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion
perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of
wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an
interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states
as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that
bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the
sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for
a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a
shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading
of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance
of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to
himself: "I was asleep."</p>
<p>In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting
me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out
of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:</p>
<p>"My poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you
now."</p>
<p>We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a
creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which
was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay
panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its
convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one
nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at
all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed,
reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of
a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to
us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast
that was stirring there, where could my grandmother be? Yes, I
could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now
to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot
still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets
aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those
blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing.</p>
<p>Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which
to sponge my grandmother's forehead. It was the only thing that
refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push
back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me
from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last
throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those
'extra helps' whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve
the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an
air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to
the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had
asked for me: I could not escape him.</p>
<p>"I have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should
like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father." I
made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the
moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as
one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the
importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him
to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the
drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going
resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to
honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed
or the coffin ready.</p>
<p>"Have you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake.
And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he
never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse
de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of
the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,"
he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was
becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged
discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over
the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste.</p>
<p>This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in
the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted
(only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen
who were 'quite the best' in their respective lines. And the old
Duchesse de Mortemart <i>née</i> Guermantes (I never could
understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess,
one almost invariably says: "The old Duchess of So-and-so" or,
alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young:
"The little Duchess of So-and-so,") would prescribe almost
automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases:
"Dieulafoy, Dieulafoy!" as, if one wanted a place for ices, she
would advise: 'Poiré Blanche,' or for small pastry 'Rebattet,
Rebattet.' But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of
fact, just sent for Dieulafoy.</p>
<p>At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some
cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe
more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little
expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal
him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that
nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or
more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a
perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and,
although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated
protestations of "Sir, Sir, Sir," dragged me across to Mamma,
saying: "Will you do me the great honour of presenting me to your
mother?" letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it
was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not
help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face.
There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of
which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just
going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently
proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed
by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the
speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a
visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would
have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught
sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had
come to us in haste to inquire for news. "I say, this is a piece
of luck!" cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the
sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of
my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not
sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed
seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the
house, carried off by his uncle who,&mdash;having had something
very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to
Doncières on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at
being able to save himself so much exertion. "Upon my soul, if
anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I
should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as
your friend M. Bloch would say, it's a regular farce." And as he
disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the
shoulder: "All the same," he went on, "it's quite clear I must
have touched the hangman's rope or something; I do have the most
astounding luck." Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred;
far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of
putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in
that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who,
after composing their faces and saying: "This is a very painful
occasion," after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to
rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a
social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with
a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan
the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their
own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or
offer a 'lift' in their carriage when it is time to go home. The
Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the 'good
wind' that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still
so surprised at the reception&mdash;natural as it was&mdash;that
had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that
she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had
'absent fits' during which she seemed literally not to hear a
word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no
self-possession and perhaps even was not quite 'all there.' At
the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was
told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the
circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him
greatly 'affected' by the sad event. But he had still stored up
in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had
been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real
nature of Mamma's sorrow that he asked me, the day before the
funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her.</p>
<p>A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and
whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head
of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained
leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the
bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without,
however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid's face. At one
point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this
cleric's grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly.
He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened.
He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in
painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then
cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his
fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his
sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind
his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was
hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I
was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had
left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any
reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was
tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me.
In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of
the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however
cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some
such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must
have forgotten?</p>
<p>The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and
to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of
oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in
their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its
place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I
found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted
instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be
greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the
room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely
less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse
rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a
slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the
morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing
quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in
the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of
the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother's breath no longer
laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a
skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath,
unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed,
there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs
which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine
impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have
ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious
accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase
which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth
afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then,
having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so
much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication
from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether
like a spring that has ceased to flow.</p>
<p>Françoise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not
possess the art&mdash;as simple as that need was futile&mdash;of
giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother's case as quite
hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was
impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to
repeat: "It makes me feel all queer," in the same tone in which
she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage
broth: "It's like a load on my stomach," sensations both of which
were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly
expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was
aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained
at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as 'the
Cambrousse' and where she felt herself growing
'<i>pétrousse</i>,' in other words fossilised), would not,
presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony,
which was certain, Françoise felt, to be a superb spectacle.
Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made
Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week
free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of
the funeral. She was determined at least to 'go over it all' with
him on his return.</p>
<p>For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of
our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during
the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of
indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed
made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable
accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage.
Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an
antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally
enjoyed. He was always 'sent for' in times of great trouble, and
was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their
mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health,
despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling
beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms,
not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who
thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would
soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he
was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:</p>
<p>"Promise me that you won't come 'to-morrow.' Please, for 'her
sake.' At any rate, you won't go 'all the way.' It's what she
would have wished."</p>
<p>But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to
arrive 'at the house,' by reason of which he had been given,
among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of 'No flowers by
request.' And before attending everything he had always 'attended
to everything,' which entitled him to the formula: "We don't know
how to thank you."</p>
<p>"What's that?" came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who
had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our
cousin had just said to my father.</p>
<p>"Nothing," answered the cousin. "I was just saying that I'd
heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down
there, and here we've got too much sun."</p>
<p>"Yet the barometer is very low," put in my father.</p>
<p>"Where did you say the weather was bad?" asked my
grandfather.</p>
<p>"At Combray."</p>
<p>"Ah! I'm not surprised; whenever it's bad here it's fine at
Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has
anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, don't worry about that, it's been done," said my cousin,
whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard,
dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having 'remembered'
it.</p>
<p>At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that
a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply
that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive
him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on
the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in
almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great
physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in
which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for
forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the
arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in
coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name
foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part,
and when the servant announced: "M. Dieulafoy," one imagined
oneself at a play by Molière. To the dignity of his attitude was
added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect
figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the
convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty
of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy
without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence,
which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the
slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a
deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the
great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to
tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of
courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a
few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I
felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from
saying: "Professor Dieulafoy." But already our visitor had turned
away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and
left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply
taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his
hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left
wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him,
such a conjurer's nimbleness had he put into the act of making it
vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity&mdash;which
was increased rather&mdash;of the great consultant in his long
frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of
a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements
shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and
patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the
embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man
is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have
rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the 'capacity' in
which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished
manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any
successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed
M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no
existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the
cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up
timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a
flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked
to her: "Old Norpois came to the house and to the church and on
here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you
ought really to say a word to him, he'll be so gratified if you
do," my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed,
could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears.
A couple of days earlier&mdash;to anticipate once again before
returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my
grandmother lay dying&mdash;while they were watching by the body,
Françoise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was
terrified by the least sound, had said: "I believe that's her."
But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words
aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead
should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still.</p>
<p>To return now to those last hours, "You heard about the
telegram her sisters sent us?" my grandfather asked the
cousin.</p>
<p>"Yes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it's worth framing;
still, I'm not surprised."</p>
<p>"My poor wife, who was so fond of them, too," said my
grandfather, wiping away a tear. "We mustn't blame them. They're
stark mad, both of them, as I've always said. What's the matter
now; aren't you going on with the oxygen?"</p>
<p>My mother spoke: "Oh, but then Mamma will be having more
trouble with her breathing."</p>
<p>The doctor reassured her: "Oh, no! The effect of the oxygen
will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently."</p>
<p>It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying
woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we
could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the
oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her
breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished,
without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all
was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those
transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a
sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of
unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the
heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother's pulse, but
already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the
dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted
measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same
inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my
grandmother's being conscious of them, a countless throng of
happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not
escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long
been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that
everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was
to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this
earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by
every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched
with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a
leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They
made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother.</p>
<p>"But I thought she couldn't see anything now?" said my
father.</p>
<p>"One can never be sure," replied the doctor.</p>
<p>When my lips touched her face, my grandmother's hands
quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex
perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their
hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of
unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to
love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort,
as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Françoise
could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering
what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room.
At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself
hurriedly in front of Françoise to hide her tears, while my
parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen
had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My
grandmother was dead.</p>
<p>An hour or two later Françoise was able for the last time, and
without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses
which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so
old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was
they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again,
from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the
swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of
years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time
when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the
features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks
glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness,
with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually
destroyed. Life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the
disillusionments of life. A smile seemed to be hovering on my
grandmother's lips. On that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor
of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young
maiden.</p>

<h3><i>CHAPTER TWO</i></h3>
<h4>[A VISIT FROM ALBERTINE]</h4>
<p><span class="aa">Albeit</span> it was simply a Sunday in
autumn, I had been born again, life lay intact before me, for
that morning, after a succession of mild days, there had been a
cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday. A change in
the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew.
Formerly, when the wind howled in my chimney, I would listen to
the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an
emotion as if, like the famous bow-taps with which the C Minor
Symphony opens, they had been the irresistible appeal of a
mysterious destiny. Every change in the aspect of nature offers
us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to
harmonise with the new form of things. The mist, from the moment
of my awakening, had made of me, instead of the centrifugal being
which one is on fine days, a self-centred man, longing for the
chimney corner and the nuptial couch, a shivering Adam in quest
of a sedentary Eve, in this different world.</p>
<p>Between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the
taste of a cup of chocolate I tried to account for all the
originality of the physical, intellectual and moral life which I
had taken with me, about a year earlier, to Doncières, and which,
blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside&mdash;always
present even when it was invisible&mdash;formed in me a series of
pleasures entirely distinct from all others, incommunicable to my
friends, in the sense that the impressions, richly interwoven
with one another, which gave them their orchestral accompaniment
were a great deal more characteristic of them, to my subconscious
mind, than any facts that I might have related. From this point
of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had
immersed me was a world already known to me (which only made it
more real) and forgotten for some time (which restored all its
novelty). And I was able to look at several of the pictures of
misty landscapes which my memory had acquired, notably a series
of 'Mornings at Doncières,' including my first morning there in
barracks and another, in a neighbouring country house, where I
had gone with Saint-Loup to spend the night: in which from the
windows, whose curtains I had drawn back at daybreak, before
getting into bed again, in the first a trooper, in the second (on
the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was
engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist) a
coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those
rare figures, scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself
to the mysterious vagueness of their half-lights, which emerge
from an obliterated fresco.</p>
<p>It was from my bed that I was looking this afternoon at these
pictorial memories, for I had gone back to bed to wait until the
hour came at which, taking advantage of the absence of my
parents, who had gone for a few days to Combray, I proposed to
get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening
in Mme. de Villeparisis's drawing-room. Had they been at home I
should perhaps not have ventured to go out; my mother in the
delicacy of her respect for my grandmother's memory, wished the
tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely
given; she would not have forbidden me this outing, she would
have disapproved of it. From Combray, on the other hand, had I
consulted her wishes, she would not have replied in a melancholy:
"Do just as you like; you are old enough now to know what is
right or wrong," but, reproaching herself for having left me
alone in Paris, and measuring my grief by her own, would have
wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused
to herself, and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother,
solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of
my nervous balance, would have advised me to take.</p>
<p>That morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the
first time been lighted. Its disagreeable sound&mdash;an
intermittent hiccough&mdash;had no part whatsoever in my memories
of Doncières. But its prolonged encounter, in me this afternoon,
with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that
whenever, after succeeding more or less in forgetting it, I heard
the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them.</p>
<p>There was no one else in the house but Françoise. The grey
light, falling like a fine rain on the earth, wove without
ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday holiday-makers
appeared in a silvery sheen. I had flung to the foot of my bed
the <i>Figaro</i>, for which I had been sending out religiously
every morning, ever since I had sent in an article which it had
not yet printed; despite the absence of the sun, the intensity of
the daylight was an indication that we were still only half-way
through the afternoon. The tulle window-curtains, vaporous and
friable as they would not have been on a fine day, had that same
blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies' wings have, and
Venetian glass. It depressed me all the more that I should be
spending this Sunday by myself because I had sent a note that
morning to Mlle. de Stermaria. Robert de Saint-Loup, whom his
mother had at length succeeded in parting&mdash;after painful and
abortive attempts&mdash;from his mistress, and who immediately
afterwards had been sent to Morocco in the hope of his there
forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to
love, had sent me a line, which had reached me the day before,
announcing his arrival, presently, in France for a short spell of
leave. As he would only be passing through Paris (where his
family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with
Rachel), he informed me, to shew me that he had been thinking of
me, that he had met at Tangier Mile, or rather Mme. (for she had
divorced her husband three months after their marriage) de
Stermaria. And Robert, remembering what I had told him at Balbec,
had asked her, on my behalf, to arrange a meeting. She would be
delighted to dine with me, she had told him, on one of the
evenings which, before her return to Brittany, she would be
spending in Paris. He warned me to lose no time in writing to
Mme. de Stermaria, for she would certainly have arrived before I
got his letter. This had come as no surprise to me, even although
I had had no news of him since, at the time of my grandmother's
last illness, he had accused me of perfidy and treachery. It had
then been quite easy to see what must have happened. Rachel, who
liked to provoke his jealousy&mdash;she had other reasons also
for wishing me harm&mdash;had persuaded her lover that I had made
a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence. It
is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this
allegation, but he had ceased to be in love with her, which meant
that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete
indifference to him, and our friendship alone remained. When, on
meeting him again, I attempted to speak to him about his attack
on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile, which
gave him the air of begging my pardon; then he turned the
conversation to something else. All this was not to say that he
did not, a little later, see Rachel occasionally when he was in
Paris. The fellow-creatures who have played a leading part in
one's life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any
finality. They return to take their old place in it at odd
moments (so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of
old love) before leaving it for ever. Saint-Loup's breach with
Rachel had very soon become less painful to him, thanks to the
soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for
money. Jealousy, which prolongs the course of love, is not
capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other
forms of imagination. If one takes with one, when one starts on a
journey, three or four images which incidentally one is sure to
lose on the way (such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the
Ponte Vecchio, or the Persian church shrouded in mist), one's
trunk is already pretty full. When one parts from a mistress one
would be just as glad, until one has begun to forget her, that
she should not become the property of three or four potential
protectors whom one has in one's mind's eye, of whom, that is to
say, one is jealous: all those whom one does not so picture count
for nothing. Now frequent demands for money from a cast-off
mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts
shewing a high temperature would of her illness. But the latter
would at any rate be an indication that she was ill, and the
former furnish a presumption, vague enough, it is true, that the
forsaken one, or forsaker (whichever she be) cannot have found
anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors. And so
each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the
jealous one's sufferings, while he responds to it at once by
dispatching money, for naturally he does not like to think of her
being in want of anything, except lovers (one of the three lovers
he has in his mind's eye), until time has enabled him to regain
his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the
name of his successor. Sometimes Rachel came in so late at night
that she could ask her former lover's permission to lie down
beside him until the morning. This was a great comfort to Robert,
for it refreshed his memory of how they had, after all, lived in
intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater
part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere
with her sleep. He realised that she was more comfortable, lying
close to his body, than she would have been elsewhere, that she
felt herself, by his side&mdash;even in an hotel&mdash;to be in a
bedroom known of old, in which the force of habit prevails and
one sleeps better. He felt that his shoulders, his limbs, all of
him were for her, even when he was unduly restless, from
sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so
entirely usual that they could not disturb her, and that the
perception of them added still further to her sense of
repose.</p>
<p>To revert to where we were, I had been all the more disquieted
by Robert's letter in that I could read between the lines what he
had not ventured to write more explicitly. "You can most
certainly ask her to dine in a private room," he told me. "She is
a charming young person, a delightful nature you will get on
splendidly with her, and I am sure you will have a capital
evening together." As my parents were returning at the end of the
week on Saturday or Sunday, and as after that I should be forced
to dine every evening at home, I had written at once to Mme. de
Stermaria, proposing any evening that might suit her, up to
Friday. A message was brought back that I should hear from her in
writing the same evening, about eight o'clock. The time would
have passed quickly enough if I had had, during the afternoon
that separated me from her letter, the help of a visit from
anyone else. When the hours pass wrapped in conversation one
ceases to count, or indeed to notice them, they vanish, and
suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped
you that there reappears the nimble truant time. But if we are
alone, our preoccupation, by bringing before us the still distant
and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity
of a ticking pendulum, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by
all the minutes which, had we been with friends, we should not
have counted. And confronted, by the incessant return of my
desire, with the ardent pleasure which I was going to
taste&mdash;not for some days though, alas!&mdash;in Mme. de
Stermaria's company, this afternoon, which I should have to spend
by myself, seemed to me very empty and very melancholy.</p>
<p>Every now and then I heard the sound of the lift coming up,
but it was followed by a second sound, not that for which I was
hoping, namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing,
but another very different sound which the lift made in
continuing its progress to the floors above and which, because it
so often meant the desertion of my floor when I was expecting a
visitor, remained for me at other times, even when I had no wish
to see anyone, a sound lugubrious in itself, in which there
echoed, as it were, a sentence of solitary confinement. Weary,
resigned, busy for several hours still over its immemorial task,
the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and
shade, and it saddened me to think that I was to be left alone
with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who,
installed by the window so as to see better while she finished
her work, paid no attention to the person present with her in the
room. Suddenly, although I had heard no bell, Françoise opened
the door to let in Albertine, who came forward smiling, silent,
plump, containing in the fulness of her body, made ready so that
I might continue living them, come in search of me, the days we
had spent together at that Balbec to which I had never since
returned. No doubt, whenever we see again a person with whom our
relations&mdash;however trivial they may have been&mdash;are
altered, it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods. For
this, we do not require that a former mistress should come to
call upon us as a friend, all that we need is the visit to Paris
of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some
particular kind of life, and that this life should have ceased
for us, were it no more than a week ago. On each of Albertine's
smiling, questioning, blushing features I could read the
questions: "And Madame de Villeparisis? And the dancing-master?
And the pastry-cook?" When she sat down her back seemed to be
saying: "Gracious! There's no cliff here; you don't mind if I sit
down beside you, all the same, as I used to do at Balbec?" She
was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time.
In this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but
with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms. With
Albertine, however, there was something more than this.
Certainly, even at Balbec, in our daily encounters, I had always
been surprised when she came in sight, so variable was her
appearance from day to day. But now it was difficult to recognise
her. Cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them, her
features had emerged like those of a statue. She had another
face, or rather she had a face at last; her body too had grown.
There remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she
had been enclosed and on the surface of which, at Balbec, her
future outline had been barely visible.</p>
<p>This time, Albertine had returned to Paris earlier than usual.
As a rule she came only in the spring, which meant that, already
disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating
down the first flowers, I did not distinguish, in the elements of
the pleasure that I felt, the return of Albertine from that of
the fine weather. It was enough that I should be told that she
was in Paris and that she had called at the house, for me to see
her again like a rose flowering by the sea. I cannot say whether
it was the desire for Balbec or for herself that overcame me at
such moments; possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy,
cowardly, and incomplete method of possessing Balbec, as if to
possess a thing materially, to take up one's abode in a town,
were equivalent to possessing it spiritually. Besides, even
materially, when she was no longer posed by my imagination before
a horizon of sea, but sitting still in a room with me, she seemed
to me often a very poor specimen of a rose, so poor, indeed, that
I would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or
that blemish of its petals, and to imagine instead that I was
inhaling the salt air on the beach.</p>
<p>I must say it at this point, albeit I was not then aware of
what was to happen only later on. Certainly, it is more
reasonable to devote one's life to women than to postage stamps
or old snuff-boxes, even to pictures or statues. Only the example
of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes, to
have not one woman only but several. Those charming suggestions
in which a girl abounds of a sea-beach, of the braided hair of a
statue in church, of an old print, of everything that makes one
see and admire in her, whenever she appears, a charming
composition, those suggestions are not very stable. Live with a
woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things
that made you love her; though I must add that these two sundered
elements can be reunited by jealousy. If, after a long period of
life in common, I was to end by seeing nothing more in Albertine
than an ordinary woman, an intrigue between her and some person
whom she had loved at Balbec would still suffice, perhaps, to
reincorporate in her, to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling
of the tide. Only, as these secondary suggestions no longer
captivate our eyes, it is to the heart that they are perceptible
and fatal. We cannot, under so dangerous a form, regard the
repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired. But I am
anticipating the course of years. And here I need only state my
regret that I did not have the sense simply to have kept my
collection of women as people keep their collections of old
quizzing glasses, never so complete, in their cabinet, that there
is not room always for another and rarer still.</p>
<p>Departing from the customary order of her holiday movements,
this year she had come straight from Balbec, where furthermore
she had not stayed nearly so late as usual. It was a long time
since I had seen her, and as I did not know even by name the
people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in Paris, I could
form no impression of her during the periods in which she
abstained from coming to see me. These lasted often for quite a
time. Then, one fine day, in would burst Albertine whose rosy
apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better
informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval
which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which
my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce.</p>
<p>This time, however, certain signs seemed to indicate that some
new experience must have entered into that life. And yet,
perhaps, all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that
girls change very rapidly at the age which Albertine had now
reached. For instance, her intellect was now more in evidence,
and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so
much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making Sophocles
write: "My dear Racine," she was the first to laugh, quite
wholeheartedly, at her own stupidity. "Andrée was quite right; it
was stupid of me," she admitted. "Sophocles ought to have begun:
'Sir.'" I replied that the 'Sir,' and 'Dear Sir,' of Andrée were
no less comic than her own 'My dear Racine,' or Gisèle's 'My dear
Friend,' but that after all the really stupid people were the
Professors who still went on making Sophocles write letters to
Racine. Here, however, Albertine was unable to follow me. She
could not see in what the silliness consisted; her intelligence
was dawning, but had not fully developed. There were other more
attractive novelties in her; I felt, in this same pretty girl who
had just sat down by my bed, something that was different; and in
those lines which, in one's eyes and other features, express
one's general attitude towards life, a change of front, a partial
conversion, as though there had now been shattered those
resistances against which I had hurled my strength in vain at
Balbec, one evening, now remote in time, on which we formed a
couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present
arrangement, since then it had been she who was lying down and I
who sat by her bedside. Wishing and not venturing to make certain
whether now she would let herself be kissed, every time that she
rose to go I asked her to stay beside me a little longer. This
was a concession not very easy to obtain, for albeit she had
nothing to do (otherwise she would have rushed from the house)
she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very
gracious towards me, scarcely to be at ease in my company, and
yet each time, after looking at her watch, she sat down again at
my request until finally she had spent several hours with me
without my having asked her for anything; the things I was saying
to her followed logically those that I had said during the hours
before, and bore no relation to what I was thinking about, what I
desired from her, remained indefinitely parallel. There is
nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from
bearing any resemblance to what one has in one's mind. Time
presses, and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time
by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are
obsessed. We then arrange that the sentence which we should like
to utter shall be accompanied, or rather preluded, by a gesture,
supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the
pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the
curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it,
without a word said, without even a 'By your leave,' already made
this gesture. Certainly I was not in the least in love with
Albertine; child of the mists outside, she could merely content
the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened
in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied
by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture
respectively, for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling
with my flesh a substance different and warm, and of attaching at
some point to my outstretched body a body divergent, as the body
of Eve barely holds by the feet to the side of Adam, to whose
body hers is almost perpendicular, in those romanesque
bas-reliefs on the church at Balbec which represent in so noble
and so reposeful a fashion, still almost like a classical frieze,
the Creation of Woman; God in them is everywhere followed, as by
two ministers, by two little angels in whom the visitor
recognises&mdash;like winged, swarming summer creatures which
winter has surprised and spared&mdash;cupids from Herculaneum,
still surviving well into the thirteenth century, and winging
their last slow flight, weary but never failing in the grace that
might be expected of them, over the whole front of the porch.</p>
<p>As for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would
have set me free from these meditations and which I should have
sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman, had I been
asked upon what&mdash;in the course of this endless flow of talk
throughout which I took care to keep from Albertine the one thing
that was in my mind&mdash;was based my optimistic hypothesis with
regard to her possible complaisances, I should perhaps have
answered that this hypothesis was due (while the forgotten
outlines of Albertine's voice retraced for me the contour of her
personality) to the apparition of certain words which did not
form part of her vocabulary, or at least not in the acceptation
which she now gave them. Thus she said to roe that Elstir was
stupid, and, on my protesting:</p>
<p>"You don't understand," she replied, smiling, "I mean that it
was stupid of him to behave like that; of course I know he's
quite a distinguished Person, really."</p>
<p>Similarly, wishing to say of the Fontainebleau golf club that
it was smart, she declared: "They are quite a selection."</p>
<p>Speaking of a duel that I had fought, she said of my seconds:
"What very choice seconds," and looking at my face confessed that
she would like to see me 'wear a moustache.' She even went so far
(and my chance appeared then enormous) as to announce, in a
phrase of which I would have sworn that she was ignorant a year
earlier, that since she had last seen Gisèle there had passed a
certain 'lapse of time.' This was not to say that Albertine had
not already possessed, when I was at Balbec, a quite adequate
assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one's
people are in easy circumstances, and which, year by year, a
mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her,
gradually, as the girl grows up, on important occasions, her own
jewels. It was evident that Albertine had ceased to be a little
girl when one day, to express her thanks for a present which a
strange lady had given her, she had said: "I am quite confused."
Mme. Bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose
comment was:</p>
<p>"Gad, she's old for fourteen."</p>
<p>The approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still
when Albertine, speaking of another girl whose tone was bad,
said: "One can't even tell whether she's pretty, she paints her
face a foot thick." Finally, though still a schoolgirl, she
already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing
and station when she said, of some one whose face twitched: "I
can't look at him, because it makes me want to do the same," or,
if some one else were being imitated: "The absurd thing about it
is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her."
All these are drawn from the social treasury. But it did not seem
to me possible that Albertine's natural environment could have
supplied her with 'distinguished,' used in the sense in which my
father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met, but
whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised: "It appears
he's quite a distinguished person." 'Selection,' even when used
of a golf club, seemed to me as incompatible with the Simonet
family as it would be if preceded by the adjective 'Natural,'
with a text published centuries before the researches of Darwin.
'Lapse of time' struck me as being of better augury still.
Finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals, the
nature of which was unknown to me, but sufficient to justify me
in all my hopes when Albertine announced, with the satisfaction
of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised:</p>
<p>"To my mind, that is the best thing that could possibly
happen. I regard it as the best solution, the stylish way
out."</p>
<p>This was so novel, so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving
one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto
unknown to her, that on hearing the words 'to my mind' I drew
Albertine towards me, and at 'I regard' made her sit on the side
of my bed.</p>
<p>No doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture, on
marrying well-read men, receive such expressions as part of their
paraphernalia. And shortly after the metamorphosis which follows
the wedding night, when they begin to pay calls, and talk shyly
to the friends of their girlhood, one notices with surprise that
they have turned into matrons if, in deciding that some person is
intelligent, they sound both 'l's in the word; but that is
precisely the sign of a change of state, and I could see a
difference when I thought of the vocabulary of the Albertine I
had known of old&mdash;a vocabulary in which the most daring
flights were to say of any unusual person: 'He's a type,' or, if
you suggested a game of cards to her: 'I've no money to lose,' or
again, if any of her friends were to reproach her, in terms which
she felt to be undeserved: 'That really is magnificent!' an
expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle-class
tradition almost as old as the <i>Magnificat</i> itself, and one
which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in
the right employs, as the saying is, 'quite naturally,' that is
to say because she has learned the words from her mother, just as
she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend. All
these expressions Mme. Bontemps had imparted to her at the same
time as her hatred of the Jews and her feeling for black, which
was always suitable and becoming, indeed without any formal
instruction, but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves
as a model for that of the young ones, recently hatched, so that
they in turn grow into true goldfinches also. But when all was
said, 'selection' appeared to me of alien growth and 'I regard'
encouraging. Albertine was no longer the same; which meant that
she would not perhaps act, would not react in the same way.</p>
<p>Not only did I no longer feel any love for her, but I had no
longer to consider, as I should have had at Balbec, the risk of
shattering in her an affection for myself, which no longer
existed. There could be no doubt that she had long since become
quite indifferent to me. I was well aware that to her I was in no
sense a member now of the 'little band' into which I had at one
time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have
secured admission. Besides, as she had no longer even, as in
Balbec days, an air of frank good nature, I felt no serious
scruples: still I believe that what made me finally decide was
another philological discovery. As, continuing to add fresh links
to the external chain of talk behind which I hid my intimate
desire, I spoke, having Albertine secure now on the corner of my
bed, of one of the girls of the little band, one smaller than the
rest, whom, nevertheless, I had thought quite pretty, "Yes,"
answered Albertine, "she reminds me of a little <i>mousmé</i>."
There had been nothing in the world to shew, when I first knew
Albertine, that she had ever heard the word <i>mousmé</i>. It was
probable that, had things followed their normal course, she would
never have learned it, and for my part I should have seen no
cause for regret in that, for there is no more horrible word in
the language. The mere sound of it makes one's teeth ache as they
do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one's mouth.
But coming from Albertine, as she sat there looking so pretty,
not even '<i>mousmé</i>' could strike me as unpleasant. On the
contrary, I felt it to be a revelation, if not of an outward
initiation, at any rate of an inward evolution. Unfortunately it
was now time for me to bid her good-bye if I wished her to reach
home in time for her dinner, and myself to be out of bed and
dressed in time for my own. It was Françoise who was getting it
ready; she did not like having to keep it back, and must already
have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code
that Albertine, in the absence of my parents, should be paying me
so prolonged a visit, and one which was going to make everything
late. But before '<i>mousmé</i>' all these arguments fell to the
ground and I hastened to say:</p>
<p>"Just fancy; I'm not in the least ticklish; you can go on
tickling me for an hour on end and I won't even feel it."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"I assure you."</p>
<p>She understood, doubtless, that this was the awkward
expression of a desire on my part, for, like a person who offers
to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to
ask him, though what you have said has shewn him that it would be
of great service to you.</p>
<p>"Would you like me to try?" she inquired, with womanly
meekness.</p>
<p>"Just as you like, but you would be more comfortable if you
lay down properly on the bed."</p>
<p>"Like that?"</p>
<p>"No; get right on top."</p>
<p>"You're sure I'm not too heavy?"</p>
<p>As she uttered these words the door opened and Françoise,
carrying a lamp, came in. Albertine had just time to fling
herself back upon her chair. Perhaps Françoise had chosen this
moment to confound us, having been listening at the door or even
peeping through the keyhole. But there was no need to suppose
anything of the sort; she might have scorned to assure herself,
by the use of her eyes, of what her instinct must plainly enough
have detected, for by dint of living with me and my parents her
fears, her prudence, her alertness, her cunning had ended by
giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us
all that the mariner has of the sea, the quarry of the hunter,
and, of the malady, if not the physician, often at any rate the
patient. The amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire
would have astounded a stranger, and with as good reason as does
the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the
ancients, seeing that there was practically no source of
information open to them. (Her sources were no larger. They were
a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our
conversation at dinner, caught on the wing by the butler and
inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen.) Again, her mistakes
were due, like theirs, like the fables in which Plato believed,
rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived
ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal.
Only the other day, has it not been possible for the most
important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a
scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments
of any sort? But if the drawbacks arising from her menial
position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning
indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal&mdash;and
which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us
the results of her discoveries&mdash;the limitations under which
she worked had done more; in this case the impediment, not
content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination,
had greatly strengthened it. Of course Françoise never let slip
any artificial device, those for example of diction and attitude.
Since (if she never believed what we said to her, hoping that she
would believe it) she admitted without any shadow of doubt the
truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life
might tell her, however absurd, which might at the same time
prove shocking to our ideas, just as her way of listening to our
assertions bore witness to her incredulity, so the accents in
which she reported (the use of indirect speech enabling her to
hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity) the narrative
of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers,
and won from them, by treating them before all the world like
dirt, any number of privileges and concessions, shewed that the
story was to her as gospel. Françoise went so far as to add: "I'm
sure, if I had been the mistress I should have been quite vexed."
In vain might we, despite our scant sympathy at first with the
lady on the fourth floor, shrug our shoulders, as though at an
unlikely fable, at this report of so shocking an example; in
making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing, the
lacerating force of the most unquestionable, most irritating
affirmation.</p>
<p>But above all, just as great writers often attain to a power
of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under
a system of political liberty or literary anarchy, when they are
bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry, by
the severity of prosodic laws or of a state religion, so
Françoise, not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion,
spoke like Tiresias and would have written like Tacitus. She
managed to embody everything that she could not express directly
in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without
accusing ourselves, indeed in less than a sentence, in a silence,
in the way in which she placed a thing in a room.</p>
<p>Thus when I happened to leave, by accident, on my table, among
a pile of other letters, one which it was imperative that she
should not see, because, let us say, it referred to her with a
dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards
her in the recipient as in the writer, that evening, if I came
home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room,
there on top of my letters, neatly arranged in a symmetrical
pile, the compromising document caught my eye as it could not
possibly have failed to catch the eye of Françoise, placed by her
right at the top, almost separated from the rest, in a prominence
that was a form of speech, that had an eloquence all its own,
and, as I stood in the doorway, made me shudder like a cry. She
excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects, intended so
to enlighten the spectator, in her absence, that he already knew
that she knew everything when in due course she made her
appearance. She possessed, for thus making an inanimate object
speak, the art, at once inspired and painstaking, of Irving or
Frédéric Lemaître. On this occasion, holding over Albertine and
myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the
still visible depressions which the girl's body had hollowed in
the counterpane, Françoise made one think of a picture of
'Justice throwing light upon Crime.' Albertine's face did not
suffer by this illumination. It revealed on her cheeks the same
sunny burnish that had charmed me at Balbec. This face of
Albertine, the general effect of Which sometimes was, out of
doors, a sort of milky pallor, now shewed, according as the lamp
shone on them, surfaces so dazzlingly, so uniformly coloured, so
firm, so glowing that one might have compared them to the
sustained flesh tints of certain flowers. Taken aback meanwhile
by the unexpected entry of Françoise, I exclaimed:</p>
<p>"What? The lamp already? I say, the light is strong!"</p>
<p>My object, as may be imagined, was by the second of these
ejaculations to account for my confusion, by the first to excuse
my lateness in rising. Françoise replied with a cruel
ambiguity:</p>
<p>"Do you want me to extinglish it?"</p>
<p>"&mdash;guish!" Albertine slipped into my ear, leaving me
charmed by the familiar vivacity with which, taking me at once
for teacher and for accomplice, she insinuated this psychological
affirmation as though asking a grammatical question. When
Françoise had left the room and Albertine was seated once again
on my bed:</p>
<p>"Do you know what I'm afraid of?" I asked her. "It is that if
we go on like this I may not be able to resist the temptation to
kiss you."</p>
<p>"That would be a fine pity."</p>
<p>I did not respond at once to this invitation, which another
man might even have found superfluous, for Albertine's way of
pronouncing her words was so carnal, so seductive that merely in
speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you. A word from her
was a favour, and her conversation covered you with kisses. And
yet it was highly attractive to me, this invitation. It would
have been so, indeed, coming from any pretty girl of Albertine's
age; but that Albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me
more than pleasure, brought before my eyes a series of images
that bore the stamp of beauty. I recalled the original Albertine
standing between me and the beach, almost painted upon a
background of sea, having for me no more real existence than
those figures seen on the stage, when one knows not whether one
is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear, at
an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal's part,
or at a mere projection from a lantern. Then the real woman had
detached herself from the luminous mass, had come towards me,
with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had
nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed
to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that
it was not possible to touch her, to embrace her, that one might
only talk to her, that' for me she was no more a woman than the
jade grapes, an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on
dinner tables, are really fruit. And now she was appearing to me
in a third plane, real as in the second experience that I had had
of her but facile as in the first; facile, and all the more
deliciously so in that I had so long imagined that she was not.
My surplus knowledge of life (of a life less uniform, less simple
than I had at first supposed it to be) inclined me provisionally
towards agnosticism. What can one positively affirm, when the
thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to
be false and in the third instance turns out true? And alas, I
was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to
Albertine. In any case, even if there had not been the romantic
attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes
revealed one after another by life (an attraction the opposite of
that which Saint-Loup had felt during our dinners at Rivebelle on
recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence
had overlaid them, in a calm face, features to which his lips had
once been pressed), the knowledge that to kiss Albertine's cheeks
was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than
that of kissing them. What a difference between possessing a
woman to whom one applies one's body alone, because she is no
more than a piece of flesh, and possessing the girl whom one used
to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even
knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others, which
made one tremble to think that one might not see her again. Life
had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of
this little girl, had lent one, for the study of her, first one
optical instrument, then another, and had added to one's carnal
desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and
diversified it with those other desires, more spiritual and less
easily assuaged, which do not emerge from their torpor, leaving
carnal desire to move by itself, when it aims only at the
conquest of a piece of flesh, but which to gain possession of a
whole tract of memories, whence they have felt the wretchedness
of exile, rise in a tempest round about it, enlarge, extend it,
are unable to follow it to the accomplishment, the assimilation,
impossible in the form in which it is looked for, of an
immaterial reality, but wait for this desire halfway and at the
moment of recollection, of return furnish it afresh with their
escort; to kiss, instead of the cheeks of the first comer,
however cool and fresh they might be, but anonymous, with no
secret, with no distinction, those of which I had so long been
dreaming, would be to know the taste, the savour of a colour on
which I had endlessly gazed. One has seen a woman, a mere image
in the decorative setting of life, like Albertine, outlined
against the sea, and then one has been able to take that image,
to detach it, to bring it close to oneself, gradually to discern
its solidity, its colours, as though one had placed it behind the
glasses of a stereoscope. It is for this reason that the women
who are a little difficult, whose resistance one does not at once
overcome, of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one
ever will overcome it, are alone interesting. For to know them,
to approach them, to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form,
in dimensions, in relief the human image, is an example of
relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful
to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a
silhouette in the setting of one's life. The women one meets
first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain
invariable.</p>
<p>In addition, Albertine preserved, inseparably attached to her,
all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which I was
particularly fond. I felt that it was possible for me, on the
girl's two cheeks, to kiss the whole of the beach at Balbec.</p>
<p>"If you really don't mind my kissing you, I would rather put
it off for a little and choose a good moment. Only you mustn't
forget that you've said I may. I shall want a voucher: 'Valid for
one kiss.'"</p>
<p>"Shall I have to sign it?"</p>
<p>"But if I took it now, should I be entitled to another later
on?"</p>
<p>"You do make me laugh with your vouchers; I shall issue a new
one every now and then."</p>
<p>"Tell me; just one thing more. You know, at Balbec, before I
had been introduced to you, you used often to have a hard,
calculating look; you can't tell me what you were thinking about
when you looked like that?"</p>
<p>"No; I don't remember at all."</p>
<p>"Wait; this may remind you: one day your friend Gisèle put her
feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was
sitting in. Try to remember what was in your mind at that
moment."</p>
<p>"Gisèle was the one we saw least of; she did belong to the
band, I suppose, but not properly. I expect I thought that she
was very ill-bred and common."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all?"</p>
<p>I should certainly have liked, before kissing her, to be able
to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on
the beach before I knew her, to find latent in her the place in
which she had lived earlier still; for that, at any rate, if I
knew nothing of it, I could substitute all my memories of our
life at Balbec, the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking
beneath my window, the shouts of the children. But when I let my
eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks, the gently
curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first
foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating
mountain chains, thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the
hollows of deep valleys, I could not help saying to myself: "Now
at last, after failing at Balbec, I am going to learn the
fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in Albertine's cheeks,
and, since the cycles through which we are able to make things
and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively
few, perhaps I ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when,
having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that
I had chosen from among all others, I shall have brought it into
this new plane in which I shall at last acquire a tactual
experience of it with my lips." I told myself this because I
believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the
lips; I told myself that I was going to know the taste of this
fleshly rose, because I had never stopped to think that man, a
creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the
sea-urchin or even the whale, is nevertheless still unprovided
with a certain number of essential organs, and notably possesses
none that will serve for kissing. The place of this absent organ
he supplies with his lips, and thereby arrives perhaps at a
slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to
caressing the beloved with a horny tusk. But a pair of lips,
designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the
appetite, must be content, without ever realising their mistake
or admitting their disappointment, with roaming over the surface
and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but
irresistible cheek. Besides, at such moments, at the actual
contact between flesh and flesh, the lips, even supposing them to
become more expert and better endowed, could taste no better
probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually
grasping, for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to
find their proper nourishment, they are alone; the sense of
sight, then that of smell have long since deserted them. To begin
with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my
eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss, my eyes, changing
their position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat,
studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass
shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the
character of the face.</p>
<p>Apart from the most recent applications of the art of
photography&mdash;which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral
all the houses which, time and again, when we stood near them,
have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers,
drill and deploy like a regiment, in file, in open order, in
mass, the same famous and familiar structures, bring into actual
contact the two columns on the Piazzetta which a moment ago were
so far apart, thrust away the adjoining dome of the Salute, and
in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole
immense horizon within the span of a bridge, in the embrasure of
a window, among the leaves of a tree that stands in the
foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone, give
successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of
all the others&mdash;I can think of nothing that can so
effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing
with one definite aspect, the hundred other things which it may
equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less
legitimate. In short, just as at Balbec Albertine had often
appeared to me different, so now, as if, wildly accelerating the
speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a
person presents to us in the course of our various encounters, I
had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so
as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies
the individuality of a fellow creature, and to draw out one from
another, like a nest of boxes, all the possibilities that it
contains, in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it
was ten Albertines that I saw; this single girl being like a
goddess with several heads, that which I had last seen, if I
tried to approach it, gave place to another. At least so long as
I had not touched it, that head, I could still see it, a faint
perfume reached me from it. But alas&mdash;for in this matter of
kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are
shaped&mdash;suddenly my eyes ceased to see; next, my nose,
crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and,
without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose
of my desire, I learned, from these unpleasant signs, that at
last I was in the act of kissing Albertine's cheek.</p>
<p>Was it because we were enacting&mdash;as may be illustrated by
the rotation of a solid body&mdash;the converse of our scene
together at Balbec, because it was I, now, who was lying in bed
and she who sat beside me, capable of evading any brutal attack
and of dictating her pleasure to me, that she allowed me to take
so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with
so forbidding a frown? (No doubt from that same frown the
voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach
of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably
minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that
there is between the gesture of 'finishing off' a wounded man and
that of bringing him relief, between a sublime and a hideous
portrait.) Not knowing whether I had to give the credit, and to
feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting
benefactor who in these last months, in Paris or at Balbec, had
been working on my behalf, I supposed that the respective
positions in which we were now placed might account for it. It
was quite another explanation, however, that Albertine offered
me; this, in short: "Oh, well, you see, that time at Balbec I
didn't know you properly. For all I knew, you might have meant
mischief." This argument left me in perplexity. Albertine was no
doubt sincere in advancing it. So difficult is it for a woman to
recognise in the movements of her limbs, in the sensations felt
by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a
friend, the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think
that a stranger was planning her fall.</p>
<p>In any case, whatever the modifications that had occurred at
some recent time in her life, which might perhaps have explained
why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and
purely physical desire what at Balbec she had with horror refused
to allow to my love, another far more surprising manifested
itself in Albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had
procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed
to notice, which, indeed, I had been afraid might provoke in her
the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which
Gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel
shrubbery in the Champs-Elysées.</p>
<p>The exact opposite happened. Already, when I had first made
her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her, Albertine had
assumed an air which I did not remember in her, of docile good
will, of an almost childish simplicity. Obliterating every trace
of her customary anxieties and interests, the moment preceding
pleasure, similar in this respect to the moment after death, had
restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the
innocence of earliest childhood. And no doubt everyone whose
special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest,
devoted, charming; especially if by this talent he knows that he
is giving us a great pleasure, he is himself happy in the display
of it, anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as
possible. But in this new expression on Albertine's face there
was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness, conscience,
generosity, a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and
it was farther than to her own childhood, it was to the infancy
of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who
had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation, which I
had finally secured, Albertine seemed to feel that it would
indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to
believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a
moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything.
She, who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago, now,
presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that
love took precedence of all other duties, said when I reminded
her of her dinner:</p>
<p>"Oh, but that doesn't matter in the least; I have plenty of
time."</p>
<p>She seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going
immediately after what had happened, embarrassed by good manners,
just as Françoise when, without feeling thirsty, she had felt
herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine
which Jupien offered her, would never have dared to leave him as
soon as the last drops were drained, however urgent the call of
duty. Albertine&mdash;and this was perhaps, with another which
the reader will learn in due course, one of the reasons which had
made me unconsciously desire her&mdash;was one of the
incarnations of the little French peasant whose type may be seen
in stone at Saint-André-des-Champs. As in Françoise, who
presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy, I
recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger, a sense
of decency, of respect for the bedside.</p>
<p>Françoise who, after the death of my aunt, felt obliged to
speak only in a plaintive tone, would, in the months that
preceded her daughter's marriage, have been quite shocked if,
when the young couple walked out together, the girl had not taken
her lover's arm. Albertine lying motionless beside me said:</p>
<p>"What nice hair you have; what nice eyes; you are a dear
boy."</p>
<p>When, after pointing out to her that it was getting late, I
added: "You don't believe me?" she replied, what was perhaps true
but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few
hours:</p>
<p>"I always believe you."</p>
<p>She spoke to me of myself, my family, my social position. She
said: "Oh, I know your parents know some very nice people. You
are a friend of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage." For the
moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me. But
suddenly I remembered that I had indeed played as a child in the
Champs-Elysées with Robert Forestier, whom I had never seen since
then. As for Suzanne Delage, she was the great-niece of Mme.
Blatin, and I had once been going to a dancing lesson, and had
even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted
in her mother's drawing-room. But the fear of being sent into
fits of laughter, and of a bleeding nose, had made me decline, so
that I had never set eyes on her. I had at the most a vague idea
that I had once heard that the Swanns' governess with the feather
in her hat had at one time been with the Delages, but perhaps it
was only a sister of this governess, or a friend. I protested to
Albertine that Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage occupied a
very small place in my life. "That may be; but your mothers are
friends, I can place you by that. I often pass Suzanne Delage in
the Avenue de Messine, I admire her style." Our mothers were
acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps, who having
heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier, to
whom, it appeared, I used to recite poetry, had concluded from
that that we were bound by family ties. She could never, I
gathered, hear my mother's name mentioned without observing: "Oh,
yes, she is in the Delage Forestier set," giving my parents a
good mark which they had done nothing to deserve.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Albertine's social ideas were fatuous in the
extreme. She regarded the Simonnets with a double 'n' as inferior
not only to the Simonets with a single 'n' but to everyone in the
world. That some one else should bear the same name as yourself
without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for
despising him. Of course there are exceptions. It may happen that
two Simonnets (introduced to one another at one of those
gatherings where one feels the need to converse, no matter on
what subject, and where moreover one is instinctively well
disposed towards strangers, for instance in a funeral procession
on its way to the cemetery), finding that they have the same
name, will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success
to discover a possible connexion. But that is only an exception.
Plenty of people are of dubious character, but we either know
nothing or care nothing about them. If, however, a similarity of
names brings to our door letters addressed to them, or vice
versa, we at once feel a mistrust, often justified, as to their
moral worth. We are afraid of being confused with them, we
forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers
to them in our hearing. When we read our own name, as borne by
them, in the newspaper, they seem to have usurped it. The
transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us
cold. We lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes.
The hatred which we bear towards the other Simonnets is all the
stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been
transmitted by heredity. After the second generation we remember
only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used
to refer to the other Simonnets, we know nothing of the reason,
we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a
murder. Until, as is not uncommon, the time comes when a male and
female Simonnet, who are not related in any way, are joined
together in matrimony and so repair the breach.</p>
<p>Not only did Albertine speak to me of Robert Forestier and
Suzanne Delage, but spontaneously, with that impulse to confide
which the approximation of two human bodies creates, that is to
say at first, before it has engendered a special duplicity and
reticence in one person towards the other, she told me a story
about her own family and one of Andrée's uncles, as to which, at
Balbec, she had refused to utter a word; thinking that now she
ought not to appear to have any secrets in which I might not
share. From this moment, had her dearest friend said anything to
her against me, she would have made it her duty to inform me. I
insisted upon her going home, and finally she did go, but so
ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost
as though to apologise for me, as a hostess to whose party you
have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended
nevertheless.</p>
<p>"Are you laughing at me?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"I am not laughing, I am smiling at you," she replied
lovingly. "When am I going to see you again?" she went on, as
though declining to admit that what had just happened between us,
since it is generally the crowning consummation, might not be at
least the prelude to a great friendship, a friendship already
existing which we should have to discover, to confess, and which
alone could account for the surrender we had made of
ourselves.</p>
<p>"Since you give me leave, I shall send for you when I can." I
dared not let her know that I was subordinating everything else
to the chance of seeing Mme. de Stermaria. "It will have to be at
short notice, unfortunately," I went on, "I never know
beforehand. Would it be possible for me to send round for you in
the evenings, when I am free?"</p>
<p>"It will be quite possible in a little while, I am going to
have a latch-key of my own. But just at present it can't be done.
Anyhow I shall come round to-morrow or next day in the afternoon.
You needn't see me if you're busy."</p>
<p>On reaching the door, surprised that I had not anticipated
her, she offered me her cheek, feeling that there was no need now
for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another.
The brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the
sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often
tend, Albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and
add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed
the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol
for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived
in the mind of a gothic minstrel.</p>
<p>When she had left me, this young Picard, who might have been
carved on his porch by the image-maker of Saint-André-des-Champs,
Françoise brought me a letter which filled me with joy, for it
was from Mme. de Stermaria, who accepted my invitation to dinner.
From Mme. de Stermaria, that was to say for me not so much from
the real Mme. de Stermaria as from her of whom I had been
thinking all day before Albertine's arrival. It is the terrible
deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with
a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and
kept in our brain, the only form of her moreover that we have
always at our disposal, the only one that we shall ever possess,
one which the arbitrary power of memory, almost as absolute as
that of imagination, may have made as different from the real
woman as had been from the real Balbec the Balbec of my dreams;
an artificial creation to which by degrees, and to our own hurt,
we shall force the real woman into resemblance.</p>
<p>Albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished
when I entered Mme. de Villeparisis's drawing-room; and having
little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were
pouring out, discussing the great piece of news, the separation,
said to be already effected, of the Duc de Guermantes from his
wife, I had, until I should have an opportunity of shaking hands
with my hostess, taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer
room, when from the other, in which she had no doubt had her
chair in the very front row of all, I saw emerging, majestic,
ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood
out in relief huge black poppies, the Duchess herself. The sight
of her no longer disturbed me in the least. There had been a day
when, laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she
was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: "You really must
stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the
neighbours are talking about you. Besides, look how ill your
grandmother is, you really have something more serious to think
about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you," in a
moment, like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant
country in which one imagined oneself to be, and opens one's eyes
for one, or like the doctor who, by recalling one to a sense of
duty and reality, cures one of an imaginary disease in which one
has been indulging one's fancy, my mother had awakened me from an
unduly protracted dream. The rest of the day had been consecrated
to a last farewell to this malady which I was renouncing; I had
sung, for hours on end and weeping as I sang, the sad words of
Schubert's <i>Adieu</i>:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:25%;">Farewell, strange
voices call thee</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:15%;">Away from me, dear
sister of the angels.</div>
<p>And then it had finished. I had given up my morning walks, and
with so little difficulty that I thought myself justified in the
prophecy (which we shall see was to prove false later on) that I
should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing
to see a woman. And when, shortly afterwards, Françoise had
reported to me that Jupien, anxious to enlarge his business, was
looking for a shop in the neighbourhood, wishing to find one for
him (quite happy, moreover, when strolling along a street which
already from my bed I had heard luminously vociferous like a
peopled beach, to see behind the raised iron shutters of the
dairies the young milk-girls with their white sleeves), I had
been able to begin these excursions again. Nor did I feel the
slightest constraint; for I was conscious that I was no longer
going out with the object of seeing Mme. de Guermantes; much as a
married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a
lover, from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his
letters lying about, at the risk of disclosing to her husband an
infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be
guilty of it. What troubled me now was the discovery that almost
every house sheltered some unhappy person. In one the wife was
always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her. In the
next it was the other way about. In another a hardworking mother,
beaten black and blue by a drunkard son, was endeavouring to
conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite
half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the
people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that
I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and
wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been
withheld from them, and shewed themselves charming and faithful
to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in
the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being
useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we
learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard, whose workrooms
were separated from Jupien's shop only by the flimsiest of
partitions, was shortly to be 'given notice' by the Duke's agent
because his hammering made too much noise. Jupien could have
hoped for nothing better; the workrooms had a basement for
storing timber, which communicated with our cellars. He could
keep his coal in this, he could knock down the partition, and
would then have a huge shop all in one room. But even without the
amusement of house-hunting on his behalf I had continued to go
out every day before luncheon, just as Jupien himself, finding
the rent that M. de Guermantes was asking him exorbitant, was
allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope that,
discouraged by his failure to find a tenant, the Duke would
resign himself to accepting a lower offer. Françoise, noticing
that, even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to
call, the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch,
scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was
engaged to the Guermantes footman (they would find a lovers'
retreat there) and to catch them red-handed.</p>
<p>However that might be, and for all that I had no longer to
find Jupien a new shop, I still went out before luncheon. Often,
on these excursions, I met M. de Norpois. It would happen that,
conversing as he walked with a colleague, he cast at me a glance
which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to
his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any
more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me
before. For, with these eminent diplomats, looking at you in a
certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen
you but that they have not seen you and that they have some
serious question to discuss with the colleague who is
accompanying them. A tall woman whom I frequently encountered
near the house was less discreet with me. For in spite of the
fact that I did not know her, she would turn round to look at me,
would wait for me, unavailingly, before shop windows, smile at me
as though she were going to kiss me, make gestures indicative of
a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if
anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these
morning walks, thinking only of what I had to do, were it but the
most trivial purchase of a newspaper, I had chosen the shortest
way, with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the
Duchess followed in her walks, and if on the other hand it lay
along that course, without either compunction or concealment,
because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which I
should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes
on her against her will. But it had never occurred to me that my
recovery, when it restored me to a normal attitude towards Mme.
de Guermantes, would have a corresponding effect on her, and so
render possible a friendliness, even a friendship in which I no
longer felt any interest. Until then, the efforts of the entire
world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have
been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an
ill-starred love. Fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed
that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we
have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula: "I am no
longer in love." I had been vexed with Saint-Loup for not having
taken me to see his aunt. But he was no more capable than anyone
else of breaking an enchantment. So long as I was in love with
Mme. de Guermantes, the marks of politeness that ï received from
others, their compliments actually distressed me, not only
because they did not come from her but because she would never
hear of them. And yet even if she had known of them it would not
have been of the slightest use to me. Indeed, among the lesser
auxiliaries to success in love, an absence, the declining of an
invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are
of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the
world. There would be plenty of social success, were people
taught upon these lines the art of succeeding.</p>
<p>As she swept through the room in which I was sitting, her mind
filled with thoughts of friends whom I did not know and whom she
would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party, Mme. de
Guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa, genuinely indifferent
and seeking only to be polite whereas while I was in love I had
tried so desperately, without ever succeeding, to assume an air
of indifference; she swerved aside, came towards me and,
reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the
Opéra-Comique, which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by
some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to
obliterate: "No, don't move; you don't mind if I sit down beside
you for a moment?" she asked, gracefully gathering in her immense
skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa.</p>
<p>Of less stature than she, who was further expanded by the
volume of her gown, I was almost brushed by her exquisite bare
arm round which a faint, innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke
like a golden mist, and by the fringe of her fair tresses which
wafted their fragrance over me. Having barely room to sit down,
she could not turn easily to face me, and so obliged to look
straight before her rather than in my direction, assumed the sort
of dreamy, sweet expression one sees in a portrait.</p>
<p>"Have you any news of Robert?" she inquired.</p>
<p>At that moment Mme. de Villeparisis entered the room.</p>
<p>"Well, Sir, you arrive at a fine time, when we do see you here
for once in a way!" And noticing that I was talking to her niece,
concluding, perhaps, that we were more intimate than she had
supposed: "But don't let me interrupt your conversation with
Oriane," she went on, and (for these good offices as pander are
part of the duties of the perfect hostess): "You wouldn't care to
dine with her here on Thursday?"</p>
<p>It was the day on which I was to entertain Mme. de Stermaria,
so I declined.</p>
<p>"Saturday, then?"</p>
<p>As my mother was returning on Saturday or Sunday, it would
never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with
her; I therefore declined this invitation also.</p>
<p>"Ah, you're not an easy person to get hold of."</p>
<p>"Why do you never come to see me?" inquired Mme. de Guermantes
when Mme. de Villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the
performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses
upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value, for
it had cost no more than twenty francs. (This, incidentally, was
as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once.
Those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings
throughout the season received roses painted by the
Marquise.)</p>
<p>"It's such a bore that we never see each other except in other
people's houses. Since you won't meet me at dinner at my aunt's,
why not come and dine with me?" Various people who had stayed to
the last possible moment, upon one pretext or another, but were
at length preparing to leave, seeing that the Duchess had sat
down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to
contain them both, thought that they must have been misinformed,
that it was the Duchess, and not the Duke, who was seeking a
separation, and on my account. Whereupon they hastened to spread
abroad this intelligence. I had better grounds than anyone to be
aware of its falsehood. But I was myself surprised that at one of
those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet
completed is beginning to take effect, the Duchess, instead of
withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite
a&mdash;person whom she knew so slightly. The suspicion crossed
my mind that it had been the Duke alone who had been opposed to
her having me in the house, and that now that he was leaving her
she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the
people that she liked.</p>
<p>A minute earlier I should have been stupefied had anyone told
me that Mme. de Guermantes was going to ask me to call on her,
let alone to dine with her. I might be perfectly aware that the
Guermantes drawing-room could not furnish those particular
refinements which I had extracted from the name of its occupants,
the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me, by obliging me
to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the
drawing-rooms of which we have read the description in a novel,
or seen the image in a dream, made me, even when I was certain
that it was just like any other, imagine it as quite different.
Between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends. To
dine with the Guermantes was like travelling to a place I had
long wished to see, making a desire emerge from my brain and take
shape before my eyes, forming acquaintance with a dream. At the
most, I might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners
to which one's hosts invite one with: "Do come; there'll be
<i>absolutely</i> nobody but ourselves," pretending to attribute
to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought
of his mixing with their other friends, seeking indeed to convert
into an enviable privilege, reserved for their intimates alone,
the quarantine of the outsider, hopelessly uncouth, whom they are
befriending. I felt on the contrary that Mme. de Guermantes was
anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had
to offer me when she went on, projecting as she spoke before my
eyes as it were the violet-hued loveliness of a visit to
Fabrice's aunt with the miracle of an introduction to Count
Mosca:</p>
<p>"On Friday, now, couldn't you? There are just a few people
coming; the Princesse de Parme, who is charming, not that I'd ask
you to meet anyone who wasn't nice."</p>
<p>Discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged
in a perpetual upward movement, the family still plays an
important part in certain stationary grades, such as the lower
middle class and the semi-royal aristocracy, which latter cannot
seek to raise itself since above it, from its own special point
of view, there exists nothing higher. The friendship shewn me by
her 'aunt Villeparisis' and Robert had perhaps made me, for Mme.
de Guermantes and her friends, living always upon themselves and
in the same little circle, the object of a curious interest of
which I had no suspicion.</p>
<p>She had of those two relatives a familiar, everyday, homely
knowledge, of a sort, utterly different from what we imagine, in
which if we happen to be comprised in it, so far from our actions
being at once ejected, like the grain of dust from the eye or the
drop of water from the windpipe, they are capable of remaining
engraved, and will still be related and discussed years after we
ourselves have forgotten them, in the palace in which we are
astonished to find them preserved, like a letter in our own
handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs.</p>
<p>People who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors
which are too freely invalided. But the Guermantes door was not
that. Hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it. If,
for once in a way, the Duchess had one pointed out to her, she
never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment
that he would bring, since this was a thing that she conferred
and could not receive. She thought only of his real merits. Both
Mme. de Villeparisis and Saint-Loup had testified to mine
Doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the
same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when
they wanted me, and therefore that I attached no importance to
worldly things, which seemed to the Duchess a sign that the
stranger was to be numbered among what she called 'nice
people.'</p>
<p>It was worth seeing, when one spoke to her of women for whom
she did not care, how her face changed as soon as one named, in
connexion with one of these, let us say, her sister-in-law. "Oh,
she is charming!" the Duchess would exclaim in a judicious,
confident tone. The only reason that she gave was that this lady
had declined to be introduced to the Marquise de Chaussegros and
the Princesse de Silistrie. She did not add that the lady had
declined also an introduction to herself, the Duchesse de
Guermantes. This had, nevertheless, been the case, and ever since
the mind of the Duchess had been at work trying to unravel the
motives of a woman who was so hard to know, she was dying to be
invited to call on her. People in society are so accustomed to be
sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a
phoenix and at once monopolises their attention. Was the true
motive in the mind of Mme. de Guermantes for thus inviting me
(now that I was no longer in love with her) that I did not run
after her relatives, although apparently run after myself by
them? I cannot say. In any case, having made up her mind to
invite me, she was anxious to do me the honours of the best
company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends
whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again, those
whom she knew to be boring. I had not known to what to attribute
her change of direction, when I had seen her deviate from her
stellar path, come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite
me to dinner, the effect of causes unknown for want of a special
sense to enlighten us in this respect. We picture to ourselves
the people who know us but slightly&mdash;such as, in my case,
the Duchesse de Guermantes&mdash;as thinking of us only at the
rare moments at which they set eyes on us. As a matter of fact
this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a
purely arbitrary conception on our part. So that while, in our
solitary silence, like that of a cloudless night, we imagine the
various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at
an infinite distance, we cannot help an involuntary start of
dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry
height, like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed
to be unknown on Venus or Cassiopeia, an invitation to dinner or
a piece of malicious gossip.</p>
<p>Perhaps now and then when, following the example of the
Persian princes who, according to the Book of Esther, made their
scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the
names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their
service, Mme. de Guermantes consulted her list of the
well-disposed, she had said to herself, on coming to my name: "A
man we must ask to dine some day." But other thoughts had
distracted her</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;">(Beset by surging
cares, a Prince's mind<br>
Towards fresh matters ever is inclined)</div>
<p>until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone
like Mordecai at the palace gate; and, the sight of me having
refreshed her memory, sought, like Ahasuerus, to lavish her gifts
upon me.</p>
<p>I must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally
different sort was to follow that which I had felt on hearing
Mme. de Guermantes ask me to dine with her. Since I had decided
that it would shew greater modesty, on my part, and gratitude
also not to conceal this initial surprise, but rather to
exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me, Mme. de
Guermantes, who was getting ready to go on to another, final
party, had said to me, almost as a justification and for fear of
my not being quite certain who she was, since I appeared so
astonished at being invited to dine with her: "You know I'm the
aunt of Robert de Saint-Loup, who is such a friend of yours;
besides we have met before." In replying that I was aware of this
I added that I knew also M. de Charlus, "who had been very good
to me at Balbec and in Paris." Mme. de Guermantes appeared
dumbfoundered, and her eyes seemed to turn, as though for a
verification of this statement, to some page, already filled and
turned, of her internal register of events. "What, so you know
Palamède, do you?" This name assumed on the lips of Mme. de
Guermantes a great charm, due to the instinctive simplicity with
which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure,
but for her was no more than her brother-in-law and the cousin
with whom she had grown up. And on the confused greyness which
the life of the Duchesse de Guermantes was for me this name,
Palamède, shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on
which she had played with him as a girl, at Guermantes, in the
garden. Moreover, in this long outgrown period in their lives,
Oriane de Guermantes and her cousin Palamède had been very
different from what they had since become; M. de Charlus in
particular, entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which
he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that I was
stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan
with black and yellow irises which the Duchess was at this moment
unfurling. She could also have shewn me a little sonatina which
he had once composed for her. I was completely unaware that the
Baron possessed all these talents, of which he never spoke. Let
me remark in passing that M. de Charlus did not at all relish
being called 'Palamède' by his family. That the form 'Mémé' might
not please him one could easily understand. These stupid
abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the
aristocracy to appreciate its own Poetic beauty (in Jewry, too,
we may see the same defect, since a nephew of Lady Israels, whose
name was Moses, was commonly known as 'Momo') concurrently with
its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is
aristocratic. Now M. de Charlus had, in this connexion, a greater
wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride. But the
reason for his distaste for 'Mémé' could not be this, since it
extended also to the fine name Palamède. The truth was that,
considering, knowing himself to come of a princely stock, he
would have liked his brother and sister-in-law to refer to him as
'Charlus,' just as Queen Marie-Amélie and Duc d'Orléans might
have spoken of their sons and grandsons, brothers and nephews as
'Joinville, Nemours, Chartres, Paris.'</p>
<p>"What a humbug Mémé is!" she exclaimed. "We talked to him
about you for hours; he told us that he would be delighted to
make your acquaintance, just as if he had never set eyes on you.
You must admit he's odd, and&mdash;though it's not very nice of
me to say such a thing about a brother-in-law I'm devoted to, and
really do admire immensely&mdash;a trifle mad at times."</p>
<p>I was struck by the application of this last epithet to M. de
Charlus, and said to myself that this half-madness might perhaps
account for certain things, such as his having appeared so
delighted by his own proposal that I should ask Bloch to
castigate his mother. I decided that, by reason not only of the
things he said but of the way in which he said them, M. de
Charlus must be a little mad. The first time that one listens to
a barrister or an actor, one is surprised by his tone, so
different from the conversational. But, observing that everyone
else seems to find this quite natural, one says nothing about it
to other people, one says nothing in fact to oneself, one is
content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn. At the
most, one may think, of an actor at the Théâtre-Français: "Why,
instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally, did he make it
drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least
ten minutes?" or of a Labori: "Why, whenever he opened his mouth,
did he utter those tragic, unexpected sounds to express the
simplest things?" But as everybody admits these actions to be
necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them. So, upon
thinking it over, one said to oneself that M. de Charlus spoke of
himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least
that of ordinary speech. It seemed as though one might have at
any moment interrupted him with: "But why do you shout so? Why
are you so offensive?" only everyone seemed to have tacitly
agreed that it was all right. And one took one's place in the
circle which applauded his outbursts. But certainly, at certain
moments, a stranger might have thought that he was listening to
the ravings of a maniac.</p>
<p>"But are you sure you're not thinking of some one else? Do you
really mean my brother-in-law Palamède?" went on the Duchess, a
trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity.</p>
<p>I replied that I was absolutely sure, and that M. de Charlus
must have failed to catch my name.</p>
<p>"Oh well! I shall leave you now," said Mme. de Guermantes, as
though she regretted the parting. "I must look in for a moment at
the Princesse de Ligne's. You aren't going on there? No? You
don't care for parties? You're very wise, they are too boring for
words. If only I hadn't got to go. But she's my cousin; it
wouldn't be polite. I am sorry, selfishly, for my own sake,
because I could have taken you there, and brought you back
afterwards, too. So I shall say good-bye now, and look forward to
Friday."</p>
<p>That M. de Charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by
M. d'Argencourt was all very well. But that to his own
sister-in-law, who had so high an opinion of him besides, he
should deny all knowledge of me, knowledge which was perfectly
natural seeing that I was a friend of both his aunt and his
nephew, was a thing that I could not understand.</p>
<p>I shall end my account of this incident with the remark that
from one point of view there was in Mme. de Guermantes a true
greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her
memory what other people would have only partially forgotten. Had
she never seen me waylaying her, following her, tracking her down
as she took her morning walks, had she never responded to my
daily salute with an angry impatience, had she never refused
Saint-Loup when he begged her to invite me to her house, she
could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious
manner. Not only did she waste no time in retrospective
explanations, in hints, allusions or ambiguous smiles, not only
was there in her present affability, without any harking back to
the past, without any reticence, something as proudly rectilinear
as her majestic stature, but the resentment which she might have
felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes,
the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory, or at
least from her manner, that on studying her face whenever she had
occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in
so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale
antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an
intense purity of mind.</p>
<p>But if I was surprised by the modification that had occurred
in her opinion of me, how much more did it surprise me to find a
similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her.
Had there not been a time during which I could regain life and
strength only if&mdash;always building new castles in the
air!&mdash;I had found some one who would obtain for me an
invitation to her house and, after this initial boon, would
procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart? It was
the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me
leave Paris for Doncières to visit Robert de Saint-Loup. And now
it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that I was
agitated, but on account this time of Mme. de Stermaria, not of
Mme. de Guermantes.</p>
<p>Let me add further, to conclude my account of this party, that
there Occurred at it an incident, contradicted a few days later,
which continued to puzzle me, interrupted for some time my
friendship with Bloch, and constitutes in itself one of those
curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the
next part of this work. At this party at Mme. de Villeparisis's,
Bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn
him by M. de Charlus, who, when he passed him in the street,
looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him, was
anxious to know him personally, knew quite well who he was. I
smiled at first, Bloch having expressed so vehemently at Balbec
his contempt for the said M. de Charlus. And I supposed merely
that Bloch, like his father in the Case of Bergotte, knew the
Baron 'without actually knowing him,' and that what he took for a
friendly glance was due to absent-mindedness. But finally Bloch
became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three
occasions M. de Charlus had wished to address him that,
remembering that I had spoken of my friend to the Baron, who had,
as we walked away together from this very house, as it happened,
asked me various questions about him, I came to the conclusion
that Bloch was not lying that M. de Charlus had heard his name,
realised that he was my friend' and so forth. And so, a little
later, at the theatre one evening, I asked M. de Charlus if I
might introduce Bloch to him, and, on his assenting, went in
search of my friend. But as soon as M. de Charlus caught sight of
him an expression of astonishment, instantly repressed, appeared
on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury. Not only did he
not offer Bloch his hand but whenever Bloch spoke to him he
replied in the most insolent manner, in an angry and wounding
tone. So that Bloch, who, according to his version, had received
nothing until then from the Baron but smiles, assumed that I had
not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in
which, knowing M. de Charlus's liking for formal procedure, I had
told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced.
Bloch left us, his spirit broken, like a man who has been trying
to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its
teeth, or to swim against waves which continually dash him back
on the shingle, and did not speak to me again for six months.</p>
<p>The days that preceded my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria were
for me by no means delightful, in fact it was all I could do to
live through them. For as a general rule, the shorter the
interval is that separates us from our planned objective, the
longer it seems to us, because we apply to it a more minute scale
of measurement, or simply because it occurs to us to measure it
at all. The Papacy, we are told, reckons by centuries, and indeed
may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all, since its goal is
in eternity. Mine was no more than three days off; I counted by
seconds, I gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first
movements of caresses, of caresses which it maddens us not to be
able to make the woman herself reciprocate and
complete&mdash;those identical caresses, to the exclusion of all
others. And, as a matter of fact, it is true that, generally
speaking, the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire
enhances that desire (the difficulty, not the impossibility, for
that suppresses it altogether), yet in the case of a desire that
is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised, at a
fixed and not distant point in time, is scarcely less exciting
than uncertainty; almost as much as an anxious doubt, the absence
of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure
that is bound to come, because it makes of that suspense an
innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our
proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as
could be carved by agony. What I required was to possess Mme. de
Stermaria, for during the last few days, with an incessant
activity, my desires had been preparing this pleasure, in my
imagination, and this pleasure alone, for any other kind
(pleasure, that is, taken with another woman) would not have been
ready, pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish, and
of one which is not always the same, but changes according to the
endless combinations of one's fancies, the accidents of one's
memory, the state of one's temperament, the variability of one's
desires, the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the
disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent
forgotten; I should not have been prepared, I had already turned
from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the
bridle-path of a particular desire; I should have had&mdash;in
order to wish for a different assignation&mdash;to retrace my
steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another
path. To take possession of Mme. de Stermaria on the island in
the Bois de Boulogne where I had asked her to dine with me, this
was the pleasure that I imagined to myself afresh every moment.
It would have automatically perished if I had dined on that
island without Mme. de Stermaria; but perhaps as greatly
diminished had I dined, even with her, somewhere else. Besides,
the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist
previously to the woman, to the type of woman required to give
one that pleasure. They dictate the pleasure, and the place as
well, and on that account bring to the fore alternatively, in our
capricious fancy, this or that woman, this or that scene, this or
that room, which in other weeks we should have dismissed with
contempt. Child of the attitude that produced her, one woman will
not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by
her side, while others, to be caressed with a more secret
intention, require leaves blown by the wind, water rippling in
the night, are as frail and fleeting as they.</p>
<p>No doubt in the past, long before I received Saint-Loup's
letter and when there was as yet no question of Mme. de
Stermaria, the island in the Bois had seemed to me to be
specially designed for pleasure, because I had found myself going
there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in
its shelter. It is to the shores of the lake from which one goes
to that island, and along which, in the last weeks of summer,
those ladies of Paris who have not yet left for the country take
the air, that, not knowing where to look for her, or if indeed
she has not already left Paris, one wanders in the hope of seeing
the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the
season, whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any
drawing-room until the following spring. Feeling it to be at
least the eve, if not the morrow, of the beloved's departure, one
follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive
paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last
rose, one scans that horizon where, by a device the opposite of
that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the
wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond
them the illusory appearance of depth and mass, our eyes, passing
without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural
heights of Meudon and the Mont Valérien, do not know where to set
the boundary, and make the natural country trespass upon the
handiwork of the gardener, of which they project far beyond its
own limits the artificial charm; like those rare birds reared in
the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of
their winged excursions sally forth to strike, among the
surrounding woods, an exotic note. Between the last festivity of
summer and one's winter exile, one ranges anxiously that romantic
world of chance encounters and lover's melancholy, and one would
be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the
mapped universe than if, at Versailles, looking down from the
terrace, an observatory round which the clouds are massed against
a blue sky in the manner of Van der Meulen, after having thus
risen above the bounds of nature, one were informed that, there
where nature begins again at the end of the great canal, the
villages which one just could not make out, on a horizon as
dazzling as the sea, were called Fleurus or Nimègue.</p>
<p>And then, the last carriage having rolled by, when one feels
with a throb of pain that she will not come now, one goes to dine
on the island; above the shivering poplars which suggest endless
mysteries of evening though without response, a pink cloud paints
a last touch of life in the tranquil sky. A few drops of rain
fall without noise on the water, ancient but still in its divine
infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting
the reflexions of clouds and flowers. And after the geraniums
have vainly striven, by intensifying the brilliance of their
scarlet, to resist the gathering darkness, a mist rises to
envelop the now slumbering island; one walks in the moist dimness
along the water's edge, where at the most the silent passage of a
swan startles one like, in a bed, at night, the eyes, for a
moment wide open, and the swift smile of a child whom one did not
suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a
loving companion, all the more as one feels oneself to be alone
and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world.</p>
<p>But to this island, where even in summer there was often a
mist, how much more gladly would I have brought Mme. de Stermaria
now that the cold season, the back end of autumn had come. If the
weather that had prevailed since Sunday had not by itself
rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was
living&mdash;as other seasons made them balmy, luminous,
Italian&mdash;the hope of, in a few days' time, making Mme. de
Stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise, twenty
times in an hour, a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick
imagination. In any event the mist, which since yesterday had
risen even in Paris, not only made me think incessantly of the
native place of the young woman whom I had invited to dine with
me, but, since it was probable that, far more thickly than in the
streets of the town, it must after sunset be invading the Bois,
especially the shores of the lake, I thought that it would make
the Swans' Island, for me, something like that Breton island the
marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my
mind like a garment the pale outline of Mme. de Stermaria. Of
course when we are young, at the age I had reached at the period
of my walks along the Méséglise way, our desires, our faith
bestow on a woman's clothing an individual personality, an
ultimate quintessence. We pursue reality. But by dint of allowing
it to escape we end by noticing that, after all those vain
endeavours which have led to nothing, something solid subsists,
which is what we have been seeking. We begin to separate, to
recognise what we love, we try to procure it for ourselves, be it
only by a stratagem. Then, in the absence of our vanished faith,
costume fills the gap, by means of a deliberate illusion. I knew
quite well that within half an hour of home I should not find
myself in Brittany. But in walking arm in arm with Mme. de
Stermaria in the dusk of the island, by the water's edge, I
should be acting like other men who, unable to penetrate the
walls of a convent, do at least, before enjoying a woman, clothe
her in the habit of a nun.</p>
<p>I could even look forward to hearing, as I sat with the lady,
the lapping of waves, for, on the day before our dinner, a storm
broke over Paris. I was beginning to shave myself before going to
the island to engage the room (albeit at this time of year the
island was empty and the restaurant deserted) and order the food
for our dinner next day when Françoise came in to tell me that
Albertine had called. I made her come in at once, indifferent to
her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin, her for whom at
Balbec I had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as
much agitation and distress as Mme. de Stermaria was costing me
now. The latter, I was determined, must go away with the best
possible impression from our evening together. Accordingly I
asked Albertine to come with me there and then to the island to
order the food. She to whom one gives everything is so quickly
replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving
all that one has, afresh, at every moment, without any hope of
future reward. At my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath
Albertine's flat cap, which came down very low, to her eyebrows,
seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she
sacrificed them willingly, to my great satisfaction, for I
attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young
housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about
ordering dinner.</p>
<p>It is quite true that she had represented something utterly
different for me at Balbec. But our intimacy, even when we do not
consider it close enough at the time, with a woman with whom we
are in love creates between her and us, in spite of the
shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts, social ties which
outlast our love and even the memory of our love. Then, in her
who is nothing more for us than a means of approach, an avenue
towards others, we are just as astonished and amused to learn
from our memory what her name meant originally to that other
creature which we then were as if, after giving a cabman an
address in the Boulevard des Capucines or the Rue du Bac,
thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there, we
remind ourself that the names were once those of, respectively,
the Capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry
across the Seine.</p>
<p>At the same time, my Balbec desires had so generously ripened
Albertine's body, had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh
and sweet that, as we drove through the Bois, while the wind like
a careful gardener shook the trees, brought down the fruit, swept
up the fallen leaves, I said to myself that had there been any
risk of Saint-Loup's being mistaken, or of my having
misunderstood his letter, so that my dinner with Mme. de
Stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result, I should have
made an appointment for the same evening, later on, with
Albertine, so as to forget, for a purely voluptuous hour, as I
held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since
computed, weighed up all the possible charms in which now it
abounded, the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first
phase of love for Mme. de Stermaria. And certainly if I could
have supposed that Mme de Stermaria would not grant me any of her
favours at our first meeting, I should have formed a slightly
depressing picture of my evening with her. I knew too well from
experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first
phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without
knowing her, loving in her rather the particular kind of
existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar
self&mdash;how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in
the world of facts, that is to say not in ourselves any longer
but in our meetings with her. We have, without ever having talked
to her, hesitated, tempted as we were by the poetic charm which
she represented for us. Shall it be this woman or another? And
lo, our dreams become fixed round about her, cease to have any
separate existence from her. The first meeting with her which
will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love. Nothing of
the sort. As if it were necessary that our material life should
have its first period also, in love with her already, we talk to
her in the most trivial fashion: "I asked you to dine on this
island because I thought the surroundings would amuse you. I've
nothing particular to say to you, don't you know. But it's rather
damp, I'm afraid, and you may find it cold&mdash;" "Oh, no, not
at all!" "You just say that out of politeness. Very well, Madame,
I shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter
of an hour, as I don't want to bother you, but in fifteen minutes
I shall carry you off by force. I don't want to have you catching
a chill." And without another word said we take her home,
remembering nothing about her, at the most a certain look in her
eyes, but thinking only of seeing her again. Well, at our second
meeting (when we do not find even that look, our sole memory of
her, but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her
again), the first stage is passed. Nothing has happened in the
interval. And yet, instead of talking about the comfort or want
of comfort of the restaurant, we say, without our words appearing
to surprise the new person, who seems to us positively plain but
to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us
at every moment in her life: "We are going to have our work cut
out to overcome all the obstacles in our way. Do you think we
shall be successful? Do you suppose that we can triumph over our
enemies&mdash;live happily ever afterwards, and all that sort of
thing?" But these conversational openings, trivial to begin with,
then hinting at love, would not be required; I could trust
Saint-Loup's letter for that. Mme. de Stermaria would yield
herself to me from the first, I should have no need therefore to
engage Albertine to come to me, as a makeshift, later in the
evening. It would be superfluous; Robert never exaggerated, and
his letter was explicit.</p>
<p>Albertine spoke hardly at all, conscious that my thoughts were
elsewhere. We went a little way on foot into the greenish, almost
submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees, on the domed tops of
which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt. I trod underfoot
dead leaves which, like shells, were trampled into the soil, and
poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as
sea-urchins.</p>
<p>On the boughs the last clinging leaves, shaken by the wind,
followed it only as far as their stems would allow, but sometimes
these broke, and they fell to the ground, along which they
coursed to overtake it. I thought with joy how much more remote
still, if this weather lasted, the island would be on the
morrow&mdash;and in any case quite deserted. We returned to our
carriage and, as the storm had passed off, Albertine asked me to
take her on to Saint-Cloud. As on the ground the drifting leaves
so up above the clouds were chasing the wind. And a stream of
migrant evenings, of which a sort of conic section cut through
the sky made visible the successive layers, pink, blue and green,
were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes. To
obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in
the act of leaping from her pedestal and, alone in a great wood
which seemed to be consecrated to her, filled it with the
mythological terror, half animal, half divine, of her frenzied
bounding, Albertine climbed a grassy slope while I waited for her
in the road. She herself, seen thus from below, no longer coarse
and plump as, a few days earlier, on my bed when the grain of her
throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her
person, but chiselled and delicate, seemed a little statue on
which our happy hours together at Balbec had left their patina.
When I found myself alone again at home, and remembered that I
had taken a drive that afternoon with Albertine, that I was to
dine in two days' time with Mme. de Guermantes and that I had to
answer a letter from Gilberte, three women each of whom I had
once loved, I said to myself that our social existence is, like
an artist's studio, filled with abandoned sketches in which we
have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent
form our need of a great love, but it did not occur to me that
sometimes, if the sketch be not too old, it may happen that we
return to it and make of it a work wholly different, and possibly
more important than what we had originally planned.</p>
<p>The next day was cold and fine; winter was in the
air&mdash;indeed the season was so far advanced that it had
seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged
Bois a few domes of gilded green. When I awoke I saw, as from the
window of the barracks at Doncières, a uniform, dead white mist
which hung gaily in the sunlight, consistent and sweet as a web
of spun sugar. Then the sun withdrew, and the mist thickened
still further in the afternoon. Night fell early, I made ready
for dinner, but it was still too soon to start; I decided to send
a carriage for Mme. de Stermaria. I did not like to go for her in
it myself, not wishing to force my company on her, but I gave the
driver a note for her in which I asked whether she would mind my
coming to call for her. While I waited for her answer I lay down
on my bed, shut my eyes for a moment, then opened them again.
Over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin
strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter. I recognised that
wasted hour, the large ante-room of pleasure, the dark, delicious
emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy
when, alone in my room as I was now, while all the rest were at
dinner, I saw without regret the daylight fade from above my
curtains, knowing that, presently, after a night of arctic
brevity, it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness
in the lighted rooms of Rivebelle. I sprang from my bed, tied my
black necktie, passed a brush over my hair, final gestures of a
belated tidying carried out at Balbec with my mind not on myself
but on the women whom I should see at Rivebelle while I smiled at
them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of
my room, gestures which, on that account, had continued to herald
a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be
mingled. Like magic signs they summoned, nay rather presented
this entertainment already; thanks to them I had, of its
intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as I had
had at Combray, in the month of July, when I heard the
hammer-blows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed, in the
coolness of my darkened room, a sense of warmth and sunshine.</p>
<p>Also, it was no longer exactly Mme. de Stermaria that I should
have wished most to see. Forced now to spend my evening with her,
I should have preferred, as it was almost the last before the
return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try
instead to find some of the women from Rivebelle. I gave my hands
one more final wash and, my sense of pleasure keeping me on the
move, dried them as I walked through the shuttered dining-room.
It appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what I
had taken for the bright chink of the door, which as a matter of
fact was closed, was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a
mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be
fixed in its place before Mamma's return. I thought of all the
other illusions of the sort which I had discovered in different
parts of the house, and which were not optical only, for when we
first came there I had supposed that our next-door neighbour kept
a dog on account of the continuous, almost human yapping which
came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was
turned on. And the door on to the outer landing never closed by
itself, very gently, caught by a draught on the staircase,
without rendering those broken, voluptuous, whimpering passages
which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of
Overture to <i>Tannhäuser</i>. I had, moreover, just as I had put
my towel back on its rail, an opportunity of hearing a fresh
rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment, for at a peal of
the bell I hurried out to open the door to the driver who had
come with Mme. de Stermaria's answer. I thought that his message
would be: "The lady is downstairs," or "The lady is waiting." But
he had a letter in his hand. I hesitated for a moment before
looking to see what Mme. de Stermaria had written, who, while she
held the pen in her hand, might have been anything but was now,
detached from herself, an engine of fate, pursuing a course
alone, which she was utterly powerless to alter. I asked the
driver to wait downstairs for a moment, although he was cursing
the fog. As soon as he had gone I opened the envelope. On her
card, inscribed <i>Vicomtesse Alix de. Stermaria</i>, my guest
had written: "Am so sorry&mdash;am unfortunately prevented from
dining with you this evening on the island in the Bois. Had been
so looking forward to it. Will write you a proper letter from
Stermaria. Very sorry. Kindest regards." I stood motionless,
stunned by the shock that I had received. At my feet lay the card
and envelope, fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the
shot has been fired. I picked them up, tried to analyse her
message. "She says that she cannot dine with me on the island in
the Bois. One might gather from that that she would dine with me
somewhere else. I shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch
her, but, after all, that is quite a reasonable interpretation."
And from that island in the Bois, as for the last few days my
thoughts had been installed there beforehand with Mme. de
Stermaria, I could not succeed in bringing them back to where I
was. My desire responded automatically to the gravitational force
which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end, and in
spite of this message, too recent to counteract that force, I
went on instinctively getting ready to start, just as a student,
although ploughed by the examiners, tries to answer one question
more. At last I decided to tell Françoise to go down and pay the
driver. I went along the passage without finding her, I passed
through the dining-room, where suddenly my feet ceased to sound
on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a
silence which, even before I had realised the explanation of it,
gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement. It was the
carpets which, in view of my parents' return, the servants had
begun to put down again, those carpets which look so well on
bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits
for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the
country, and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the
forest, but which now on the contrary were the first installation
of the wintry prison from which, obliged as I should be to live,
to take my meals at home, I should no longer be free now to
escape when I chose.</p>
<p>"Take care you don't slip, Sir; they're not tacked yet,"
Françoise called to me. "I ought to have lighted up. Oh, dear,
it's the end of 'Sectember' already, the fine days are over." In
no time, winter; at the corner of a window, as in a Gallé glass,
a vein of crusted snow; and even in the Champs-Elysées, instead
of the girls one waits to see, nothing but solitary sparrows.</p>
<p>What added to my distress at not seeing Mme. de Stermaria was
that her answer led me to suppose that whereas, hour by hour,
since Sunday, I had been living for this dinner alone, she had
presumably never given it a second thought. Later on I learned of
an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man
whom she must already have been seeing at this time, and who had
presumably made her forget my invitation. For if she had
remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage
which I was not, for that matter, supposed to be sending for her,
to inform me that she was otherwise engaged. My dreams of a young
feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still
non-existent love. Now my disappointment, my rage, my desperate
desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able, by
bringing my sensibility into play, to make definite the possible
love which until then my imagination alone had&mdash;and that
more loosely&mdash;offered me.</p>
<p>How many are there in our memories, how many more have we
forgotten, of these faces of girls and young women, all
different, to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied
desire to see them again only because at the last moment they
eluded us? In the case of Mme. de Stermaria there was a good deal
more than this, and it was enough now to make me love her for me
to see her again so that I might refresh those impressions, so
vivid but all too brief, which my memory would not, without such
refreshment, have the strength to keep alive when we were apart.
Circumstances decided against me; I did not see her again. It was
not she that I loved, but it might well have been. And one of the
things that made most cruel, perhaps, the great love which was
presently to come to me was that when I thought of this evening I
used to say to myself that my love might, given a slight
modification of very ordinary circumstances, have been directed
elsewhere, to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who
inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore&mdash;as I
so longed so needed to believe&mdash;absolutely necessary and
predestined.</p>
<p>Françoise had left me by myself in the dining-room with the
remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had
lighted the fire. She went to get me some dinner, for even before
the return of my parents, from this very evening, my seclusion
was to begin. I caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets, still
rolled up, and leaning against one end of the sideboard, and
burying my head in it, swallowing its dust with my own tears, as
the Jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of
mourning, I began to sob. I shuddered not only because the room
was cold, but because a distinct lowering of temperature (against
the danger and&mdash;I should add, perhaps&mdash;the by no means
disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react) is
brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our
eyes, drop by drop, like a fine, penetrating, icy rain, and seem
as though never would they cease to flow. Suddenly I heard a
voice:</p>
<p>"May I come in? Françoise told me you would be in the
dining-room. I looked in to see whether you would care to come
out and dine somewhere, if it isn't bad for your
throat&mdash;there's a fog outside you could cut with a
knife."</p>
<p>It was&mdash;arrived in Paris that morning, when I imagined
him to be still in Morocco or on the sea&mdash;Robert de
Saint-Loup.</p>
<p>I have already said (as a matter of fact, it was Robert
himself who, at Balbec, had helped me, quite without meaning it,
to arrive at this conclusion) what I think about friendship: to
wit that it is so small a thing that I find it hard to understand
how men with some claim to genius&mdash;Nietzsche, for
instance&mdash;can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it
a certain intellectual value, and consequently to deny themselves
friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part. Yes,
it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried
sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself
off, by a scruple of conscience, from Wagner's music, imagining
that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression,
naturally vague and inadequate, which our actions in general and
acts of friendship in particular furnish, or that there could be
any kind of significance in the fact of one's leaving one's work
to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the
false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far, at
Balbec, as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of
girls is less destructive of the spiritual life, to which at
least it remains alien, than friendship, the whole effort of
which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and
(save by the channel of art) incommunicable part of ourself to a
superficial self which finds&mdash;not, like the other, any joy
in itself, but rather a vague, sentimental attraction in the
feeling that it is being supported by external props, hospitably
entertained by a strange personality, through which, happy in the
protection that is afforded it there, it makes its own comfort
radiate in warm approval, and marvels at qualities which it would
denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself. Moreover the
scorners of friendship can, without illusion and not without
remorse, be the finest friends in the world, just as an artist
carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is
rather to live and carry on his work, nevertheless, so as not to
be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish, gives
his life for a vain cause, and gives it all the more gallantly in
that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it
were disinterested. But whatever might be my opinion of
friendship, to mention only the pleasure that it procured me, of
a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between
physical exhaustion and mental boredom, there is no brew so
deadly that it cannot at certain moments, become precious and
invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary,
the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves.</p>
<p>The thought of course never entered my mind now of asking
Saint-Loup to take me (as, an hour earlier, I had been longing to
go) to see some of the Rivebelle women; the scar left by my
disappointment with Mme. de Stermaria was too recent still to be
so easily healed, but at the moment when I had ceased to feel in
my heart any reason for happiness Saint-Loup's bursting in upon
me was like a sudden apparition of kindness, mirth, life, which
were external to me, no doubt, but offered themselves to me,
asked only to be made mine. He did not himself understand my
shout of gratitude, my tears of affection. And yet is there
anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends,
be he diplomat, explorer, airman or soldier like Saint-Loup, who,
having to start next day for the country, from where they will go
on heaven knows where, seem to form for themselves, in the
evening which they devote to us, an impression which we are
astonished both to find, so rare and fleeting is it, can be so
pleasant to them, and, since it does so delight them, not to see
them prolong farther or repeat more often. A meal with us, an
event so natural in itself, affords these travellers the same
strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an
Asiatic. We set off together to dine, and as I went downstairs I
thought of Doncières where every evening I used to meet Robert at
his restaurant, and the little dining-rooms there that I had
forgotten. I remembered one of these to which I had never given a
thought, and which was not in the hotel where Saint-Loup dined
but in another, far humbler, a cross between an inn and a
boarding-house, where the waiting was done by the landlady and
one of her servants. I had been forced to take shelter there once
from a snowstorm. Besides, Robert was not to be dining at the
hotel that evening and I had not cared to go any farther. My food
was brought to me, upstairs, in a little room with bare wooden
walls. The lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a
couple of candles. I, pretending that I could not see very well
as I held out my plate, while she helped me to potatoes, took her
bare fore-arm in my hand, as though to guide her. Seeing that she
did not withdraw it, I began to fondle it, then, without saying a
word, pulled her bodily to me, blew out the candles and told her
to feel in my pocket for some money. For the next few days
physical pleasure seemed to me to require, to be properly
enjoyed, not only this servant but the timbered dining-room, so
remote and lonely. And yet it was to the other, in which
Saint-Loup and his friends dined, that I returned every evening,
from force of habit and in friendship for them, until I left
Doncières. But even of this hotel, where he took his meals with
his friends, I had long ceased to think; we make little use of
our experience, we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or
precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to
us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of
tranquillity or pleasure. But those hours are not altogether
wasted. When, in their turn, come and sing to us fresh moments of
pleasure, which by themselves would pass by equally bare in
outline, the others recur, bringing with them the groundwork, the
solid consistency of a rich orchestration. They are in this way
prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture
only now and again but which continue to exist; in the present
instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine
in comfortable surroundings, which by the help of memory embody
in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel, with
a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his
energy, his affection, to communicate to us an emotional
pleasure, very different from anything that we could derive from
our own efforts or from social distractions; we are going to
exist solely for him, to utter vows of friendship which, born
within the confines of the hour, remaining imprisoned in it, will
perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which I need have no
scruple in taking before Saint-Loup since, with a courage into
which there entered a great deal of common sense and the
presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths, on
the morrow he would be gone.</p>
<p>If as I came downstairs I lived over again the evenings at
Doncières, when we reached the street, in a moment the darkness,
now almost total, in which the fog seemed to have put out the
lamps, which one could make out, glimmering very faintly, only
when close at hand, took me back to I could not say what arrival,
by night, at Combray, when the streets there were still lighted
only at long intervals and one felt one's way through a darkness
moist, warm, consecrated, like that of a Christmas manger, just
visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter
than a candle. Between that year&mdash;to which I could ascribe
no precise date&mdash;of my Combray life and the evenings at
Rivebelle which had, an hour earlier, been reflected above my
drawn curtains, what a world of differences! I felt on perceiving
them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had I been left
alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many
wasted years through which I was yet to pass before there was
revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are
the history. Had the revelation come to me this evening, the
carriage in which I sat would have deserved to rank as more
memorable with me than Dr. Percepied's, on the box seat of which
I had composed that little sketch&mdash;on which, as it happened,
I had recently laid my hands, altered it and sent it in vain to
the <i>Figaro</i>&mdash;of the spires of Martinville. Is it
because we live over our past years not in their continuous
sequence, day by day, but in a memory that fastens upon the
coolness or sun-parched heat of some morning or afternoon,
receives the shadow of some solitary place, is enclosed,
immovable, arrested, lost, remote from all others, because,
therefore, the changes gradually wrought not only in the world
outside but in our dreams and our evolving character (changes
which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to
another, wholly different time), are of necessity eliminated,
that, if we revive another memory taken from a different year, we
find between the two, thanks to lacunae, to vast stretches of
oblivion, as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the
incompatibility of two divers qualities, that of the air we
breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes? But between
one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn
of Combray, of Doncières and of Rivebelle, I was conscious at the
moment of more than a distance in time, of the distance that
there would be between two separate universes the material
elements in which were not the same. If I had sought to reproduce
the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of
Rivebelle, I should have had to streak with rosy veins, to render
at once translucent, compact, refreshing, resonant a substance
hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of Combray.
But Robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver
joined me now in the carriage. The ideas that had appeared before
me took flight. Ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make
themselves visible to a solitary mortal, at a turning in the
road, even in his bedroom while he sleeps, when they, standing
framed in the doorway, bring him the annunciation of their
tidings. But as soon as a companion joins him they vanish, in the
society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them. And I found
myself cast back upon friendship. When he first appeared Robert
had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside,
but while we were indoors, talking, it had grown steadily
thicker. It was no longer merely the light mist which I had
looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop Mme. de
Stermaria and myself. A few feet away from us the street lamps
were blotted out and then it was night, as dark as in the open
fields, in a forest, or rather on a mild Breton island whither I
would fain have gone; I lost myself, as on the stark coast of
some. Northern sea where one risks one's life twenty times over
before coming to the solitary inn; ceasing to be a mirage for
which one seeks, the fog became one of those dangers against
which one has to fight, so that we had, in finding our way and
reaching a safe haven, the difficulties, the anxiety and finally
the joy which safety, so little perceived by him who is not
threatened with the loss of it, gives to the perplexed and
benighted traveller. One thing only came near to destroying my
pleasure during our adventurous ride, owing to the angry
astonishment into which it flung me for a moment, "You know, I
told Bloch," Saint-Loup suddenly informed me, "that you didn't
really think all that of him, that you found him rather vulgar at
times. I'm like that, you see, I want people to know where they
stand," he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which
brooked no reply. I was astounded. Not only had I the most
absolute confidence in Saint-Loup, in the loyalty of his
friendship, and he had betrayed it by what he had said to Bloch,
but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been
restrained from doing so, by his defects as well as by his good
qualities, by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was
capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of
frankness. His triumphant air, was it what we assume to cloak a
certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we
ought not to have done, or did it mean complete unconsciousness;
stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which I had not
associated with him; a passing fit of ill humour towards me
prompting him to make an end of our friendship, or the notation
in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of Bloch
to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable, even
although I should be compromised by it? However that might be,
his face was seared, while he uttered this vulgar speech, by a
frightful sinuosity which I saw on it once or twice only in all
the time I knew him, and which, beginning by running more or less
down the middle of his face, when it came to his lips twisted
them, gave them a hideous expression of baseness, almost of
bestiality, quite transitory and no doubt inherited. There must
have been at such moments, which recurred probably not more than
once every other year, a partial eclipse of his true self by the
passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose
shadow fell on him. Fully as much as his satisfied air, the
words: "I want people to know where they stand," encouraged the
same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation. I
felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know
where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of
frankness to one's own affairs and not to acquire a too easy
merit at the expense of others. But by this time the carriage had
stopped outside the restaurant, the huge front of which, glazed
and streaming with light, alone succeeded in piercing the
darkness. The fog itself, beside the comfortable brightness of
the lighted interior, seemed to be waiting outside on the
pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose
faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master; shot with
the most delicate shades of light, it pointed the way like the
pillar of fire which guided the Children of Israel. Many of whom,
as it happened, were to be found inside. For this was the place
to which Bloch and his friends had long been in the habit,
maddened by a hunger as famishing as the Ritual Fast, which at
least occurs only once a year, for coffee and the satisfaction of
political curiosity, of repairing in the evenings. Every mental
excitement creating a value that overrides others, a quality
superior to the rest of one's habits, there is no taste at all
keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society
which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what
each of its members seeks before anything else from life. Here,
in their café, be it in a little provincial town, you will find
impassioned music-lovers; the greater part of their time, all
their spare cash is spent in chamber-concerts, in meetings for
musical discussion, in cafés where one finds oneself among
musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the
orchestra. Others, keen upon flying, seek to stand well with the
old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome;
sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse,
they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up
that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops, while
another, invisible a moment ago, comes suddenly swooping down to
land with the great winged roar of an Arabian roc. The little
group which met to try to perpetuate, to explore the fugitive
emotions aroused by the Zola trial attached a similar importance
to this particular café. But they were not viewed with favour by
the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had
taken possession of a second room, separated from the other only
by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants. These looked
upon Dreyfus and his supporters as traitors, albeit twenty-five
years later, ideas having had time to classify themselves and
Dreyfusism to acquire, in the light of history, a certain
distinction, the sons, dance-mad Bolshevists, of these same young
nobles were to declare to the 'intellectuals' who questioned them
that undoubtedly, had they been alive at the time, they would
have stood up for Dreyfus, without having any clearer idea of
what the great Case had been about than Comtesse Edmond de
Pourtalès or the Marquise de Galliffet, other luminaries already
extinct at the date of their birth. For on the night of the fog
the noblemen of the café, who were in due course to become the
fathers of these young intellectuals, Dreyfusards in retrospect,
were still bachelors. Naturally the idea of a rich marriage was
present in the minds of all their families, but none of them had
yet brought such a marriage off. While still potential, the only
effect of this rich marriage, the simultaneous ambition of
several of them (there were indeed several heiresses in view, but
after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that
of the aspirants to them), was to create among these young men a
certain amount of rivalry.</p>
<p>As ill luck would have it, Saint-Loup remaining outside for a
minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again
after dinner, I had to make my way in by myself. In the first
place, once I had involved myself in the spinning door, to which
I was not accustomed, I began to fear that I should never succeed
in escaping from it. (Let me note here for the benefit of lovers
of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question, despite its
peaceful appearance, is known as a 'revolver,' from the English
'revolving door.') This evening the proprietor, not venturing
either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers,
remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of
listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals, all aglow
with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in
reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way. The
smiling cordiality of his welcome was, however, dissipated by the
sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the
rotating sheets of glass. This flagrant sign of social ignorance
made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not
to utter the formula: <i>Dignus est intrare</i>. As a crowning
error I went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the
nobility, from which he at once expelled me, indicating to me,
with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed, a
place in the other room. This was all the less to my liking
because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and I had
opposite me the door reserved for the Hebrews which, as it did
not revolve, opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a
horrible draught. But the proprietor declined to move me, saying:
"No, Sir, I cannot have the whole place upset for you."
Presently, however, he forgot this belated and troublesome guest,
captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who, before
calling for his beer, his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog
(it was by now long past dinner-time), must first, as in the old
romances, pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of
his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the
contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense
of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the
camp fire.</p>
<p>One reported that his carriage, thinking it had got to the
Pont de la Concorde, had circled three times round the Invalides,
another that his, in trying to make its way down the Avenue des
Champs-Elysées, had driven into a clump of trees at the Rond
Point, from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to
get clear. Then followed lamentations upon the fog, the cold, the
deathly stillness of the streets, uttered and received with the
same exceptionally jovial air, which was accounted for by the
pleasant atmosphere of the room which, except where I sat, was
warm, the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already
accustomed to not seeing, and the buzz of talk which restored
their activity to deafened ears.</p>
<p>It was all the newcomers could do to keep silence. The
singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique
burned their tongues, and their eyes roved in search of some one
to engage in conversation. The proprietor himself lost all sense
of social distinction. "M. le Prince de Foix lost his way three
times coming from the Porte Saint-Martin," he was not afraid to
say with a laugh, actually pointing out, as though introducing
one to the other, the illustrious nobleman to an Israelite
barrister, who, on any evening but this, would have been divided
from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of
greenery. "Three times&mdash;fancy that!" said the barrister,
touching his hat. This note of personal interest was not at all
to the Prince's liking. He formed one of an aristocratic group
for whom the practice of impertinence, even at the expense of
their fellow-nobles when these were not of the very highest rank,
seemed the sole possible occupation. Not to acknowledge a bow,
and, if the polite stranger repeated the offence, to titter with
sneering contempt or fling back one's head with a look of fury,
to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them
a service, to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really
intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them,
such was the attitude of these young men, and especially of the
Prince de Foix. Such an attitude was encouraged by the
ill-balanced mentality of early manhood (a period in which, even
in the middle class, one appears ungrateful and behaves like a
cad because, having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor
after he has lost his wife, one then ceases to nod to him in the
street so as to simplify matters), but it was inspired above all
by an over-acute caste snobbishness. It is true that, after the
fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow
less pronounced in later life, this snobbishness was on the whole
to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men
who had been so intolerable when young. Once youth is outgrown,
it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence. He had
supposed it to be the only thing in the world; suddenly he
discovers, for all the Prince that he is, that there also are
such things as music, literature, even standing for parliament.
The scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins
in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain
with a glare of lightning. Which is fortunate for those of the
latter who have had the patience to wait, and whose character is
sufficiently formed&mdash;if one may so put it&mdash;for them to
feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and
welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned the Prince de Foix, it may not be
inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or
fifteen young men and to an inner group of four. The dozen or
fifteen shared this characteristic (which the Prince lacked, I
fancy) that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect. Up to
their own eyes in debt, they were of no account in those of their
tradesmen, notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing
them as 'Monsieur le Comte,' 'Monsieur le Marquis,' 'Monsieur le
Duc.' They hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the
famous rich marriage ('money-bags' as the expression still was)
and, as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most
four or five, several of them would be silently training their
batteries on the same damsel. And the secret would be so well
kept that when one of them, on arriving at the café, announced:
"My dear fellows, I am too fond of you all not to tell you of my
engagement to Mlle. d'Ambresac," there was a general outburst,
more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as
good as settled already between Mlle. d'Ambresac and himself, and
not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of
stupefaction and rage. "So you like the idea of marriage, do you
Bibi?" the Prince de Châtellerault could not help exclaiming,
letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair, for he had
been fully expecting the engagement of this identical Mlle.
d'Ambresac to be announced, but with himself, Châtellerault, as
her bridegroom. And heaven only knew all that his father had
cunningly hinted to the Ambresacs against Bibi's mother. "So you
think it'll be fun, being married, do you?" he was impelled to
repeat his question to Bibi, who, better prepared to meet it, for
he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to
adopt since the engagement had reached the semi-official stage,
replied with a smile: "What pleases me is not the idea of
marriage, which never appealed much to me, but marrying Daisy
d'Ambresac, whom I think charming." In the time taken up by this
response M. de Châtellerault had recovered his composure, but he
was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute
a change of front in the direction of Mlle. de la Canourque or
Miss Foster, numbers two and three on the list of heiresses,
pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the Ambresac
marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had
declared that Mlle. d'Ambresac was charming that this marriage
was all very well for Bibi, but that he himself would have had
all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married
her. Mme. Soléon (he decided to say) had actually announced that
she would not have them in her house.</p>
<p>But if in the eyes of tradesmen, proprietors of restaurants
and the like they seemed of little account, conversely, being
creatures of dual personality, the moment they appeared in
society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes
and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them.
They became once more M. le Prince this, M. le Duc that and were
reckoned only in terms of their quarterings. A duke who was
practically a multi-millionaire and seemed to combine in his own
person every possible distinction gave precedence to them
because, the heads of their various houses, they were by descent
sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were
entitled to coin money and so forth. Often in this café one of
them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige
the newcomer to greet him. This was because in his imaginative
pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine. Every time
that a man about town enters into relations, on this footing,
with a banker, the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred
thousand francs, which does not prevent the man about town from
at once repeating the process with another. We continue to burn
candles in churches and to consult doctors.</p>
<p>But the Prince de Foix, who was rich already, belonged not
only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men, but to a
more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included
Saint-Loup. These were never asked anywhere separately, they were
known as the four <i>gigolos</i>, they were always to be seen
riding together, in country houses their hostesses gave them
communicating bedrooms, with the result that, especially as they
were all four extremely good looking, rumours were current as to
the extent of their intimacy. I was in a position to give these
the lie direct so far as Saint-Loup was concerned. But the
curious thing is that if, later on, one was to learn that these
rumours were true of all four, each of the quartet had been
entirely in the dark as to the other three. And yet each of them
had done his utmost to find out about the others, to gratify a
desire or (more probably) a resentment, to prevent a marriage or
to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A
fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had
joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the
others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after
the group had broken up, and he himself was a married man, the
father of a family, fervently praying at Lourdes that the next
baby might be a boy or a girl, and spending the intervals of
procreation in the pursuit of soldiers.</p>
<p>Despite the Prince's code of manners, the fact that the
barrister's comment, though uttered in his hearing, had not been
directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would
otherwise have been. Besides, this evening was somewhat
exceptional. Finally, the barrister had no more prospect of
coming to know the Prince de Foix than the cabman who had driven
that noble lord to the restaurant. The Prince felt, accordingly,
that he might allow himself to reply, in an arrogant tone, as
though speaking to some one 'off stage,' to this stranger who,
thanks to the fog, was in the position of a travelling companion
whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth,
scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist: "Losing
your way's nothing; the trouble is, you can't find it again." The
wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor, for he had
already heard it several times in the course of the evening.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, in the habit of always comparing what he
heard or read with an already familiar canon, and felt his
admiration aroused if he could detect no difference. This state
of mind is by no means to be ignored, for, applied to political
conversations, to the reading of newspapers, it forms public
opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in
history. An aggregation of German landlords, simply by being
impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that
France, England and Russia were 'out to crush' Germany, made war,
at the time of Agadir, possible, even if no war occurred.
Historians, if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice
of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings, ought
to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no
importance.</p>
<p>In politics the proprietor of this particular café had for
some time now concentrated his pupil-teacher's mind on certain
particular details of the Dreyfus case. If he did not find the
terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer
or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article
boring or the speaker insincere. The Prince de Foix, however,
impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish
what he was saying. "That's right, Prince, that's right," (which
meant neither more nor less than 'repeated without a mistake')
"that's exactly how it is!" he exclaimed, expanding, like people
in the Arabian Nights 'to the limit of repletion.' But the Prince
had by this time vanished into the smaller room. Then, as life
resumes its normal course after even the most sensational
happenings, those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to
order whatever they wanted to eat or drink; among them a party of
young men from the Jockey Club who, in view of the abnormality of
the situation, had no hesitation in taking their places at a
couple of tables in the big room, and were thus quite close to
me. So the cataclysm had established even between the smaller
room and the bigger, among all these people stimulated by the
comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the
ocean of fog, a familiarity from which I alone was excluded, not
unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah's ark.
Suddenly I saw the landlord's body whipped into a series of bows,
the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which
drew every eye towards the door. "Quick, send Cyprien here, lay a
table for M. le Marquis de Saint-Loup," cried the proprietor, for
whom Robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real
importance even in the eyes of the Prince de Foix, but a client
who drove through life four-in-hand, so to speak, and spent a
great deal of money in this restaurant. The customers in the big
room looked on with interest, those in the small room shouted
simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his
shoes. But just as he was about to make his way into the small
room he caught sight of me in the big one. "Good God," he
exclaimed, "what on earth are you doing there? And with the door
wide open too?" he went on, with an angry glance at the
proprietor, who ran to shut it, throwing the blame on his staff:
"I'm always telling them to keep it shut."</p>
<p>I had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others
which stood in the way in order to reach him. "Why did you move?
Would you sooner dine here than in the little room? Why, my poor
fellow, you're freezing. You will oblige me by keeping that door
locked;" he turned to the proprietor. "This very instant, M. le
Marquis; the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through
the other, that is all." And the better to shew his zeal he
detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satellites,
vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not
properly carried out. He began to shew me exaggerated marks of
respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my
arrival but only after that of Saint-Loup, while, lest I should
think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by
his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a
surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that
was wholly personal.</p>
<p>Something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my
head for a moment. I had caught, instead of the words: "Wing of
chicken, excellent; and a glass of champagne, only not too dry,"
the unexpected: "I should prefer glycerine. Yes, hot, excellent."
I wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon
himself such a diet. I turned quickly back to Saint-Loup so as
not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite. It was
simply a doctor, whom I happened to know, and of whom another
customer, taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in
the café, was asking his professional advice. Like stockbrokers,
doctors employ the first person singular.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I was studying Saint-Loup, and my thoughts took a
line of their own. They were in this café, I had myself known at
other times, plenty of foreigners, intellectuals, budding
geniuses of all sorts, resigned to the laughter excited by their
pretentious capes, their 1830 neckties and still more by the
clumsiness of their movements, going so far as to provoke that
laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it, who yet
were men of real intellectual and moral worth, of an extreme
sensibility. They repelled&mdash;the Jews among them principally,
the unassimilated Jews, that is to say, for with the other kind
we are not concerned&mdash;those who could not endure any oddity
or eccentricity of appearance (as Bloch repelled Albertine).
Generally speaking, one realised afterwards that if they had
against them hair worn too long, noses and eyes that were too
big, stilted theatrical gestures, it was puerile to judge them by
these only, they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were
men to whom, in the long run, one could become closely attached.
Among the Jews especially there were few whose parents and
kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart, a breadth of mind in
comparison with which Saint-Loup's mother and the Duc de
Guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness, their
skin-deep religiosity which denounced only the most open
scandals, their apology for a Christianity which led invariably
(by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind) to an
enormously wealthy marriage. But in Saint-Loup, when all was
said, however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a
fresh creation of character, there reigned the most charming
openness of mind and heart. And whenever (it must be frankly
admitted, to the undying glory of France) these qualities are
found in a man who is purely French, be he noble or plebeian,
they flower&mdash;flourish would be too strong a word, for a
sense of proportion persists and also a certain
restraint&mdash;with a grace which the foreign visitor, however
estimable he may be, does not present to us. Of these
intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their
share, and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what
makes us smile they remain no less precious. But it is all the
same a pleasant thing, and one which is perhaps exclusively
French that what is fine from the standpoint of equity, what is
of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive
to the eyes, charmingly coloured, consummately chiselled, should
express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward
perfection. I studied Saint-Loup's features and said to myself
that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily
grace to prepare one for the graces within, and when the winged
nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as
the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the
field-flowers round Combray; and that the true <i>opus
francigenum</i>, the secret of which was not lost in the
thirteenth century, the beauty of which would not be lost with
the destruction of our churches, consists not so much in the
stone angels of Saint-André-des-Champs as in the young sons of
France, noble, citizen or peasant, whose faces are carved with
that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional
there as on the famous porch, but are creative still as well.</p>
<p>After leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally
the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner (he laid
great stress on our choosing 'butcher's meat,' the fowls being
presumably nothing to boast of) the proprietor came back to
inform us that M. le Prince de Foix would esteem it a favour if
M. le Marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours.
"But they are all taken," objected Robert, casting an eye over
the tables which blocked the way to mine. "That doesn't matter in
the least, if M. le Marquis would like it, I can easily ask these
people to move to another table. It is always a pleasure to do
anything for M. le Marquis!" "But you must decide," said
Saint-Loup to me. "Foix is a good fellow, he may bore you or he
may not; anyhow he's not such a fool as most of them." I told
Robert that of course I should like to meet his friend but that
now that I was for once in a way dining with him and was so
entirely happy, I should be just as well pleased to have him all
to myself. "He's got a very fine cloak, the Prince has," the
proprietor broke in upon our deliberation. "Yes, I know," said
Saint-Loup. I wanted to tell Robert that M. de Charlus had
disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sister-in-law, and to ask
him what could be the reason of this, but was prevented by the
arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been
favourably received, we caught sight of him standing beside our
table. Robert introduced us, but did not hide from his friend
that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be
disturbed. The Prince withdrew, adding to the farewell bow which
he made me a smile which, pointed at Saint-Loup, seemed to
transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting
which the Prince himself would have liked to see prolonged. As he
turned to go, Robert, struck, it appeared, by a sudden idea,
dashed off after his friend, with a "Stay where you are and get
on with your dinner, I shall be back in a moment," to me; and
vanished into the smaller room. I was pained to hear the smart
young men sitting near me, whom I did not know, repeat the most
absurd and malicious stories about the young Hereditary Grand
Duke of Luxembourg (formerly Comte de Nassau) whom I had met at
Balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at
the time of my grandmother's illness. According to one of these
young me he had said to the Duchesse de Guermantes: "I expect
everyone to get up when my wife passes," to which the Duchess had
retorted (with as little truth, had she said any such thing, as
humour, the grandmother of the young Princess having always been
the very pink of propriety): "Get up when your wife passes, do
they? Well, that's a change from her grandmother's day. She
expected the gentlemen to lie down." Then some one alleged that,
having gone down to see his aunt the Princesse de Luxembourg at
Balbec, and put up at the Grand Hotel, he had complained to the
manager there (my friend) that the royal standard of Luxembourg
was not flown in front of the hotel, over the sea. And that this
flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the
British or Italian, it had taken him several days to procure one,
greatly to the young Grand Duke's annoyance. I did not believe a
word of this story, but made up my mind, as soon as I went to
Balbec, to inquire of the manager, so as to make certain that it
was a pure invention. While waiting for Saint-Loup to return I
asked the proprietor to get me some bread. "Certainly, Monsieur
le Baron!" "I am not a Baron," I told him. "Oh, beg pardon,
Monsieur le Comte!" I had no time to lodge a second protest which
would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis; faithful
to his promise of an immediate return, Saint-Loup reappeared in
the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the
Prince de Foix, from whom I guessed that he had borrowed it in
order to keep me warm. He signed to me not to get up, and came
towards me, but either my table would have to be moved again or I
must change my seat if he was to get to his. Entering the big
room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which
ran round its walls and on which, apart from myself, there were
sitting only three or four of the young men from the Jockey Club,
friends of his own, who had not managed to find places in the
other room. Between the tables and the wall electric wires were
stretched at a certain height; without the least hesitation
Saint-Loup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a
steeplechase; embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my
benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement, I was at
the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend
performed this exercise in levitation; and in this I was not
alone; for, albeit they would probably have had but little
admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly
born and less generous client, the proprietor and his staff stood
fascinated, like racegoers in the enclosure; one underling,
apparently rooted to the ground, stood there gaping with a dish
in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting; and
when Saint-Loup, having to get past his friends, climbed on the
narrow ledge behind them and ran along it, balancing himself with
his arms, discreet applause broke from the body of the room. On
coming to where I was sitting he stopped short in his advance
with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of
a sovereign, and, stooping down, handed to me with an air of
courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which, a moment later,
having taken his place beside me, without my having to make a
single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my
shoulders.</p>
<p>"By the way, while I think of it, my uncle Charlus has
something to say to you. I promised I'd send you round to him
to-morrow evening."</p>
<p>"I was just going to speak to you about him. But to-morrow
evening I am dining with your aunt Guermantes."</p>
<p>"Yes there's a regular beanfeast to-morrow at Oriane's. I'm
not asked. But my uncle Palamède doesn't want you to go there.
You can't get out of it, I suppose? Well, anyhow, go on to my
uncle's afterwards. I'm sure he really does want to see you. Look
here, you can easily manage to get there by eleven. Eleven
o'clock; don't forget; I'll let him know. He's very touchy. If
you don't turn up he'll never forgive you. And Oriane's parties
are always over quite early. If you are only going to dine there
you can quite easily be at my uncle's by eleven. I ought really
to go and see Oriane, about getting shifted from Morocco; I want
an exchange. She is so nice about all that sort of thing, and she
can get anything she likes out of General de Saint-Joseph, who
runs that branch. But don't say anything about it to her. I've
mentioned it to the Princesse de Parme, everything will be all
right. Interesting place, Morocco. I could tell you all sorts of
things. Very fine lot of men out there. One feels they're on
one's own level, mentally."</p>
<p>"You don't think the Germans are going to go to war about
it?"</p>
<p>"No; they're annoyed with us, as after all they have every
right to be. But the Emperor is out for peace. They are always
making us think they want war, to force us to give in. Pure
bluff, you know, like poker. The Prince of Monaco, one of
Wilhelm's agents, comes and tells us in confidence that Germany
will attack us. Then we give way. But if we didn't give way,
there wouldn't be war in any shape or form. You have only to
think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days. It'd
be a bigger catastrophe than the Flood and the
<i>Götterdämmerung</i> rolled in one. Only it wouldn't last so
long."</p>
<p>He spoke to me of friendship, affection, regret, albeit like
all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for
some months, which he was to spend in the country, and would only
be staying a couple of nights in Paris on his way back to Morocco
(or elsewhere); but the words which he thus let fall into the
heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant
glow there. Our infrequent meetings, this one in particular, have
since formed a distinct episode in my memories. For him, as for
me, this was the evening of friendship. And yet the friendship
that I felt for him at this moment was scarcely, I feared (and
felt therefore some remorse at the thought), what he would have
liked to inspire. Filled still with the pleasure that I had had
in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on
arriving at his goal, I felt that this pleasure lay in my
recognising that each of the series of movements which he had
developed against the wall, along the bench, had its meaning, its
cause in Saint-Loup's own personal nature, possibly, but even
more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from
his race.</p>
<p>A certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners,
which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances
enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once&mdash;like a
musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never
seen&mdash;the feeling, the motions that were required, and to
apply the appropriate mechanism and technique; which then allowed
this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other
consideration, by which the average young man of the middle class
would have been paralysed, from fear as well of making himself
ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of
convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his
friends; the place of this constraint being taken in Robert by a
lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but
which he had received by inheritance in his body, and which had
moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with
their inferiors which, they imagined, could only flatter and
enchant those to whom it was displayed; lastly, a noble
liberality which, taking no account of his boundless natural
advantages (lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded
in making him, here as elsewhere, the most fashionable customer
and the general favourite, a position which was underlined by the
deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters
but by all its most exclusive young patrons), led him to trample
them underfoot, just as he had, actually and symbolically,
trodden upon those benches decked with purple, like a triumphal
way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more
gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side; such were the
qualities, essential to aristocracy, which through the husk of
this body, not opaque and vague as mine would have been, but
significant and limpid, transmitted as through a work of art the
industrious, energetic force which had created it and rendered
the movements of this lightfoot course which Robert had pursued
along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of
knights upon a marble frieze. "Alas!" Robert might have thought,
"was it worth while to have grown up despising birth, honouring
only justice and intellect, choosing outside the ranks of the
friends provided for me companions who were awkward and
ill-dressed, provided they had the gift of eloquence, only for
the sole personality apparent in me, which is to remain a
treasured memory, to be not that which my will, with the most
praiseworthy effort, has fashioned in my likeness, but one which
is not of my making, which is not even myself, which I have
always disliked and striven to overcome; was it worth while to
love my chosen friend as I have loved him, for the greatest
pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering
something far more general than myself, a pleasure which is not
in the least (as he says, though he cannot seriously believe it)
one of the pleasures of friendship, but an intellectual and
detached, a sort of artistic pleasure?" This is what I am now
afraid that Saint-Loup may at times have thought. If so, he was
mistaken. If he had not (as he steadfastly had) cherished
something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body, if
he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with
noble birth, there would have been something more studied, a
certain heaviness in his very agility, a self-important vulgarity
in his manners. As with Mme. de Villeparisis a strong vein of
seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her
conversation and in her Memoirs a sense of the frivolous, which
is intellectual, so, in order that Saint-Loup's body might be
indwelt by so much nobility, the latter had first to desert a
mind that was aiming at higher things, and, reabsorbed into his
body, to be fixed there in unconscious, noble lines. In this way
his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction
which otherwise would not have been complete. An artist has no
need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express
the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the
highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the
atheist, who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with
a creator. And I was quite well aware that it was not merely a
work of art that I was admiring in this young man unfolding along
the wall the frieze of his flying course; the young Prince (a
descendant of Catherine de Foix, Queen of Navarre and
grand-daughter of Charles VII) whom he had just left for my sake,
the endowments, by birth and fortune, which he was laying at my
feet, the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the
assurance, the agility, the courtesy with which he now arranged
about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak, were not all
these like friends of longer standing in his life, by whom I
might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart, and
whom, on the contrary, he was sacrificing to me by a choice which
one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind, with that
sovereign liberty of which Robert's movements were the
presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship?</p>
<p>How much familiar intercourse with a Guermantes&mdash;in place
of the distinction that it had in Robert, because there the
inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment, become an
unconscious charm, of a real moral humility&mdash;could disclose
of vulgar arrogance I had had an opportunity of seeing, not in M.
de Charlus, in whom certain characteristic faults, for which I
had been unable, so far, to account, were overlaid upon his
aristocratic habits, but in the Duc de Guermantes. And yet he
too, in the general impression of commonness which had so
strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once, years
earlier, at Mme. de Villeparisis's, included glimpses of historic
grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his
house, on the evening following that which I had spent with
Saint-Loup.</p>
<p>They had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the
Duchess when I had met them first in their aunt's drawing-room,
any more than I had discerned, on first seeing her, the
differences that set Berma apart from her fellow-players, all the
more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking
than in any social celebrity, such distinctions becoming more
marked in proportion as the objects are more real, more
conceivable by the intellect. And yet, however slight the shades
of social distinction may be (and so slight are they that when an
accurate portrayer like Sainte-Beuve tries to indicate the shades
of difference between the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. Récamier
and Mme. de Boigne, they appear so much alike that the cardinal
truth which, unknown to the author, emerges from his
investigations is the vacuity of that form of life), with them,
and for the same reason as with Berma, when the Guermantes had
ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was
no longer vaporised by my imagination, I was able to distil and
analyse it, imponderable as it was.</p>
<p>The Duchess having made no reference to her husband when she
talked to me at her aunt's party, I wondered whether, in view of
the rumours of a divorce that were current, he would be present
at the dinner. But my doubts were speedily set at rest, for
through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who
(since they must until then have regarded me much as they
regarded the children of the evicted cabinet-maker, that is to
say with more fellow-feeling perhaps than their master but as a
person incapable of being admitted to his house) must have been
asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due, I
saw slip towards me M. de Guermantes himself, who had been
watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold
and take off my greatcoat with his own hands.</p>
<p>"Mme. de Guermantes will be as pleased as punch," he greeted
me in a glibly persuasive tone. "Let me help you off with your
duds." (He felt it to be at once companionable and comic to
employ the speech of the people.) "My wife was just the least bit
afraid you might fail us, although you had fixed a date. We've
been saying to each other all day long: 'Depend upon it, he'll
never turn up.' I am bound to say, Mme. de Guermantes was a
better prophet than I was. You are not an easy man to get hold
of, and I was quite sure you were going to play us false." And
the Duke was so bad a husband, so brutal even (people said), that
one felt grateful to him, as one feels grateful to wicked people
for their occasional kindness of heart, for those words 'Mme. de
Guermantes' with which he appeared to be spreading out over the
Duchess a protecting wing, that she might be but one flesh with
him. Meanwhile, taking me familiarly by the hand, he began to
lead the way, to introduce me into his household. Just as some
casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if
it points to the survival of a local tradition, shews the trace
of some historic event unknown, it may be, to him who thus
alludes to it; so this politeness on the part of M. de
Guermantes, which, moreover, he was to continue to shew me
throughout the evening, charmed me as a survival of habits of
many centuries' growth, habits of the seventeenth century in
particular. The people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely
remote. We do not feel justified in ascribing to them any
underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal
expression; we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or
less akin to what we are feeling to-day in a Homeric hero, or
upon a skilful tactical feint in Hannibal, during the battle of
Cannae, where he let his flank be driven back in order to take
the enemy by surprise and surround him; it would seem that we
imagined the epic poet and the Punic general as being as remote
from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden. Even in
certain personages of the court of Louis XIV, when we find signs
of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of
inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever, they
leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly, as
existing among these great gentlemen, a whole world of beliefs to
which they never give any direct expression but which govern
their conduct, and especially the belief that they are bound in
politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the
most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship.</p>
<p>This imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the
things that enable us to understand how even great writers have
found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers,
such as Macpherson's <i>Ossian</i>. We so little expected to
learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel
if in what we believe to be an ancient Gaelic ode we come upon
one which we should have thought, at the most, ingenious in a
contemporary. A translator of talent has simply to add to an
ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully
reproduced fragments which, signed with a contemporary name and
published separately, would seem entertaining only; at once he
imparts a moving grandeur to his poet, who is thus made to play
upon the keyboards of several ages at once. This translator was
capable only of a mediocre book, if that book had been published
as his original work. Given out as a translation, it seems that
of a masterpiece. The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains
present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of
a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence
its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime
which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the
vital evidence which will throw a light on it; after hundreds and
thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant
land the place-names, the customs of the inhabitants, may still
extract from them some legend long anterior to the Christian era,
already unintelligible, if not actually forgotten, at the time of
Herodotus, which in the name given to a rock, in a religious
rite, dwells surrounded by the present, like an emanation of
greater density, immemorial and stable. There was similarly an
emanation, though far less ancient, of the life of the court, if
not in the manners of M. de Guermantes, which were often vulgar,
at least in the mind that controlled them. I was to breathe this
again, like the odour of antiquity, when I joined him a little
later in the drawing-room. For I did not go there at once.</p>
<p>As we left the outer hall, I had mentioned to M. de Guermantes
that I was extremely anxious to see his Elstirs. "I am at your
service. Is M. Elstir a friend of yours, then? If so, it is most
vexing, for I know him slightly; he is a pleasant fellow, what
our fathers used to call an 'honest fellow'; I might have asked
him to honour us with his company, and to dine tonight. I am sure
he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the
evening in your society." Very little suggestive of the old order
when he tried thus to assume its manner, the Duke relapsed
unconsciously into it. After inquiring whether I wished him to
shew me the pictures, he conducted me to them, gracefully
standing aside for me at each door, apologising when, to shew me
the way, he was obliged to precede me, a little scene which
(since the days when Saint-Simon relates that an ancestor of the
Guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same
punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties
of a gentleman) must, before coming gradually down to us, have
been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other
visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very
much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures, he
discreetly withdrew, telling me that I should find him in the
drawing-room when I was ready.</p>
<p>Only, once I was face to face with the Elstirs, I completely
forgot about dinner and the time; here again as at Balbec I had
before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no
more than the projection, the way of seeing things peculiar to
that great painter, which his speech in no way expressed. The
parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush,
all homogeneous with one another, were like the luminous images
of a magic lantern, which would have been in this instance the
brain of the artist, and the strangeness of which one could never
have suspected so long as one had known only the man, which was
like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured
slide had been slid into its groove. Among these pictures several
of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested
me more than the rest because they recreated those optical
illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in
identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning
intervene How often, when driving in the dark, do we not come
upon a long, lighted street which begins a few feet away from us,
when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a
rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it,
which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it
not logical, not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere
return to the very root of the impression, to represent one thing
by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we
mistook it? Surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of
the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we
have recognised them. Elstir attempted to wrest from what he had
just felt what he already knew, his effort had often been to
break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision.</p>
<p>The people who detested these 'horrors' were astonished to
find that Elstir admired Chardin, Perroneau, any number of
painters whom they, the ordinary men and women of society, liked.
They did not take into account that Elstir had had to make, for
his own part, in striving to reproduce reality (with the
particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach), the
same effort as a Chardin or a Perroneau and that consequently,
when he ceased to work for himself, he admired in them attempts
of the same order, fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of
his own. Nor did these society people include in their conception
of Elstir's work that temporal perspective which enabled them to
like, or at least to look without discomfort at Chardin's
painting. And yet the older among them might have reminded
themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen
gradually, as the years bore them away from it, the unbridgeable
gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by Ingres and
what, they had supposed, must remain for ever a 'horror' (Manet's
<i>Olympia</i>, for example) shrink until the two canvases seemed
like twins. But we learn nothing from any lesson because we have
not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the
general, and imagine ourselves always to be going through an
experience which is without precedents in the past.</p>
<p>I was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures (more
realistic, these, and in an earlier manner) of the same person,
in one in evening dress in his own drawing-room, in the other
wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where
he had evidently no business to be, which proved that for Elstir
he was not only a regular sitter but a friend, perhaps a patron
whom it pleased him (just as Carpaccio used to introduce
prominent figures, and in speaking likenesses, from contemporary
life in Venice) to introduce into his pictures, just as
Beethoven, too, found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a
favourite work the beloved name of the Archduke Rudolph. There
was something enchanting about this waterside carnival. The
river, the women's dresses, the sails of the boats, the
innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding
into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out
of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a
woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was
hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same
way in the canvas of a motionless sail, in the water of the
little harbour, in the wooden bridge, in the leaves of the trees
and in the sky. As in one of the pictures that I had seen at
Balbec, the hospital, as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis
lazuli as the cathedral itself, seemed (more bold than Elstir the
theorician, then Elstir the man of taste, the lover of things
mediaeval) to be intoning: "There is no such thing as gothic,
there is no such thing as a masterpiece; this tasteless hospital
is just as good as the glorious porch," so I now heard: "The
slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain
from glancing as he passed her by, would except from the poetical
composition which nature has set before him&mdash;her dress is
receiving the same light as the sail of that boat, and there are
no degrees of value and beauty; the commonplace dress and the
sail, beautiful in itself, are two mirrors reflecting the same
gleam; the value is all in the painter's eye." This eye had had
the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this
luminous instant, when the lady had felt hot and had stopped
dancing, when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow, when
the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze. But just
because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force,
this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression,
one felt that the lady would presently move out of it, the boats
drift away, the night draw on, that pleasure comes to an end,
that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the
convergence, at once, of so many lights do not recur. I
recognised yet another aspect, quite different it is true, of
what the moment means in a series of water-colours of
mythological subjects, dating from Elstir's first period, which
also adorned this room. Society people who held 'advanced' views
on art went 'as far as' this earliest manner, but no further.
These were certainly not the best work that he had done, but
already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out
melted its natural coldness. Thus the Muses, for instance, were
represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now
fossilised, but creatures which it would not have been surprising
in mythological times to see pass in the evening, in twos or
threes, along some mountain path. Here and there a poet, of a
race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist
(characterised by a certain sexlessness) strolled with a Muse, as
one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species
consort together. In one of these water-colours one saw a poet
wearied by long wanderings on the mountains, whom a Centaur,
meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness, had taken on his
back and was carrying home. In more than one other, the vast
landscape (in which the mythical scene, the fabulous heroes,
occupied a minute place and were almost lost) was rendered, from
the mountain tops to the sea, with an exactitude which told one
more than the hour, told one to the very minute what time of day
ft was, thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun, to the
fleeting fidelity of the shadows. In this way the artist managed
to give, by making it instantaneous, a sort of historical
reality, as of a thing actually lived, to the symbol of his
fable, painted it and set it at a definite point in the past.</p>
<p>While I was examining Elstir's paintings the bell, rung by
arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly, and had lulled
me into a pleasing unconsciousness. But the silence which
followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time
succeeded&mdash;less rapidly, it is true&mdash;in awakening me
from my dream, as the silence that follows Lindor's music arouses
Bartolo from his sleep. I was afraid that I had been forgotten,
that they had sat down to dinner, and hurried to the
drawing-room. At the door of the Elstir gallery I found a servant
waiting for me, white-haired, though whether with age or powder I
cannot say, with the air of a Spanish Minister, but treating me
with the same respect that he would have shewn to a King. I felt
from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an
hour, and I thought with alarm of the delay I had caused in the
service of dinner, especially as I had promised to be at M. de
Charlus's by eleven.</p>
<p>The Spanish Minister (though I also met on the way the footman
persecuted by the porter, who, radiant with delight when I
inquired after his girl, told me that the very next day they were
both to be off duty, so that he would be able to spend the whole
day with her, and extolled the generosity of Madame la Duchesse)
conducted me to the drawing-room, where I was afraid of finding
M. de Guermantes in an ill humour. He welcomed me, on the
contrary, with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent
artificial and dictated by politeness, but was also sincere,
prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to
famish, and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his
other guests, who completely filled the room. Indeed I heard
afterwards that I had kept them waiting for nearly three-quarters
of an hour. The Duc de Guermantes probably thought that to
prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not
intensify it and that, politeness having driven him to postpone
for so long the moment of moving into the dining-room, this
politeness would be more complete if, by not having dinner
announced immediately, he could succeed in persuading me that I
was not late, and that they had not been waiting for me. And so
he asked me, as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of
the party had not yet arrived, what I thought of his Elstirs. But
at the same time, and without letting the cravings of his stomach
become apparent, so as not to lose another moment, he, in concert
with the Duchess, proceeded to the ceremony of introduction. Then
only I perceived that there had occurred round about me, me who
until this evening, save for my novitiate in Mme. Swann's
drawing-room, had been accustomed, in my mother's homes, at
Combray and in Paris, to the manners, either protecting or
defensive, of the grim ladies of our middle-world, who treated me
as a child, a change of surroundings comparable to that which
introduces Parsifal suddenly into the midst of the
Flower-Maidens. Those who surrounded me now, their bosoms
entirely bare (the naked flesh appeared on either side of a
sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose)
could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time
bathing me in long, caressing glances, as though shyness alone
restrained them from kissing me. Many of them were nevertheless
highly respectable from the moral standpoint; many, not all, for
the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same
repulsion that my mother would have felt. The caprices of one's
conduct, denied by saintlier friends, in the face of the
evidence, seemed in the Guermantes world to matter far less than
the relations which one had been able to maintain. One pretended
not to know that the body of one's hostess was at the disposal of
all comers, provided that her visiting list showed no gaps. As
the Duke put himself out not at all for his other guests (of whom
he had long known everything that there was to know, and they of
him) but quite markedly for me, whose kind of superiority, being
outside his experience, inspired in him something akin to the
respect which the great nobleman of the court of Louis XIV used
to feel for his plebeian Ministers, he evidently considered that
the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at
all&mdash;to me at least, though it might to them&mdash;and while
I was anxious, on his account, as to the impression that I was
going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends
would impress me.</p>
<p>At the very outset I found myself completely bewildered. No
sooner had I entered the drawing-room than M. de Guermantes,
without even allowing me time to shake hands with the Duchess,
had led me, as though I were a delightful surprise to the person
in question to whom he seemed to be saying: "Here's your friend!
You see, I'm bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck,"
towards a lady of smallish stature. Whereupon, long before,
thrust forward by the Duke, I had reached her chair, the lady had
begun to flash at me continuously from her large, soft, dark eyes
the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old
friend who perhaps has not recognised us. As this was precisely
my case and I could not succeed in calling to mind who she was I
averted my eyes from her as I approached so as not to have to
respond until our introduction should have released me from my
predicament. Meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable
equilibrium the smile intended for myself. She looked as though
she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say: "Oh,
but this is a pleasure! Mamma will be pleased when I tell her
I've met you!" I was as impatient to learn her name as she was to
see that I did finally greet her, fully aware of what I was
doing, so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely,
like the note of a tuning-fork, might at length be let go. But M.
de Guermantes managed things so badly (to my mind, at least) that
I seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no
clue to the identity of my unknown friend, to whom it never
occurred to tell me herself what her name was, so obvious did the
grounds of our intimacy, which baffled me completely, seem to
her. Indeed, as soon as I had come within reach, she did not
offer me her hand, but took mine in a familiar clasp, and spoke
to me exactly as though I had been equally conscious with herself
of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted. She told me
how sorry Albert (who, I gathered, was her son) would be to have
missed seeing me. I tried to remember who, among the people I had
known as boys, was called Albert, and could think only of Bloch,
but this could not be Bloch's mother that I saw before me since
she had been dead for some time. In vain I struggled to identify
the past experience common to herself and me to which her
thoughts had been carried back. But I could no more distinguish
it through the translucent jet of her large, soft pupils which
allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can
distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked
glass, even when the sun is blazing on it. She asked me whether
my father was not working too hard, if I would not come to the
theatre some evening with Albert, if I was stronger now, and as
my replies, stumbling through the mental darkness in which I was
plunged, became distinct only to explain that I was not feeling
well that evening, she pushed forward a chair for me herself,
going to all sorts of trouble which I was not accustomed to see
taken by my parents' friends. At length the clue to the riddle
was furnished me by the Duke: "She thinks you're charming," he
murmured in my ear, which felt somehow that it had heard these
words before. They were what Mme. de Villeparisis had said to my
grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the
Princesse de Luxembourg. Everything became clear; the lady I now
saw had nothing in common with Mme. de Luxembourg, but from the
language of him who thus served me with her I could discern the
nature of the animal. It was a Royalty. She had never before
heard of either my family or myself, but, a scion of the noblest
race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world (for, a
daughter of the Prince de Parme, she had married a cousin of
equal princelihood), she sought always, in gratitude to her
Creator, to testify to her neighbour, however poor or lowly he
might be, that she did not look down upon him. Really, I might
have guessed this from her smile. I had seen the Princesse de
Luxembourg buy little rye-cakes on the beach at Balbec to give to
my grandmother, as though to a caged deer in the zoological
garden. But this was only the second Princess of the Blood Royal
to whom I had been presented, and I might be excused my failure
to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the
great. Besides, had not they themselves gone out of their way to
warn me not to count too much on this friendliness, since the
Duchesse de Guermantes, who had waved me so effusive a greeting
with her gloved hand at the Opéra-Comique, had appeared furious
when I bowed to her in the street, like people who, having once
given somebody a sovereign, feel that this has set them free from
any further obligation toward him. As for M. de Charlus, his ups
and downs were even more sharply contrasted. While in the sequel
I have known, as the reader will learn, Highnesses and Majesties
of another sort altogether, Queens who play the Queen and speak
not after the conventions of their kind but like the Queens in
Sardou's plays.</p>
<p>If M. de Guermantes had been in such haste to present me, it
was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally
known to a Royal Personage is an intolerable state of things
which must not be prolonged for a single instant. It was similar
to the haste which Saint-Loup had shewn in making me introduce
him to my grandmother. By the same token, by a fragmentary
survival of the old life of the court which is called social
courtesy and is not superficial, in which, rather, by a
centripetal reversion, it is the surface that becomes essential
and profound, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes regarded as a
duty more essential than those (which one at least of the pair
neglected often enough) of charity, chastity, pity and justice,
as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the Princesse
de Parme save in the third person.</p>
<p>Having never yet in my life been to Parma (a pilgrimage I had
been anxious to make ever since certain Easter holidays long
ago), to meet its Princess, who, I knew, owned the finest palace
in that matchless city, where, moreover, everything must be in
keeping, isolated as it was from the rest of the world, within
the polished walls, in the atmosphere, stifling as a breathless
summer evening on the Piazza of a small town in Italy, of its
compact and almost cloying name, would surely have substituted in
a flash for what I had so often tried to imagine all that did
really exist at Parma in a sort of partial arrival there, without
my having to stir from Paris, of myself; it was in the
algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a
simple equation, so to speak, of that unknown quantity. But if I
had for many years past&mdash;like a perfumer impregnating a
solid mass of grease with scent&mdash;made this name, Princesse
de Parme, absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets, in
return, when I set eyes on the Princess, who, until then I should
have sworn, must be the Sanseverina herself, a second process
began which was not, I may say, completed until several months
had passed, and consisted in expelling, by means of fresh
chemical combinations, all the essential oil of violets and all
the Stendhalian fragrance from the name of the Princess, and in
implanting there, in their place, the image of a little dark
woman, taken up with good works, of a friendliness so humble that
one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its
roots. Moreover, while, barring a few points of difference, she
was exactly like any other great lady, she was as little
Stendhalian as is, for example, in Paris, in the Europe quarter,
the Rue de Parme, which bears far less resemblance to the name of
Parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets, and reminds
one not nearly so much of the Charterhouse in which Fabrice ends
his days as of the waiting room in the Saint-Lazare station.</p>
<p>Her friendliness sprang from two causes. The first and more
general was the education which this daughter of Kings had
received. Her mother (not merely allied by blood to all the royal
families of Europe but furthermore&mdash;in contrast to the Ducal
House of Parma&mdash;richer than any reigning Princess) had
instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly
humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery; and to-day every line
of the daughter's face, the curve of her shoulders, the movements
of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson: "Remember that if God
has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not
to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom Divine
Providence has willed (wherefore His Name be praised) that you
should be superior by birth and fortune. On the contrary, you
must suffer the little ones. Your ancestors were Princes of
Treves and Juliers from the year 647: God has decreed in His
bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the
Suez Canal and three times as many Royal Dutch as Edmond de
Rothschild; your pedigree in a direct line has been established
by genealogists from the year 63 of the Christian Era; you have
as sisters-in-law two Empresses. Therefore never seem, in your
speech, to be recalling these great privileges, not that they are
precarious (for nothing can alter antiquity of race, while the
world will always need petrol), but because it is useless to
point out that you are better born than other people or that your
investments are all gilt-edged, since everyone knows these facts
already. Be helpful to the needy. Furnish to all those whom the
bounty of Heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you
as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank,
that is to say help in the form of money, even your personal
service by their sickbeds, but never (bear well in mind) invite
them to your parties, which would do them no possible good and,
by weakening your own position, would diminish the efficacy of
your benevolent activities."</p>
<p>And so even at the moments when she could not do good the
Princess endeavoured to shew, or rather to let it be thought, by
all the external signs of dumb language, that she did not
consider herself superior to the people among whom she found
herself thrown. She treated each of them with that charming
courtesy with which well-bred people treat their inferiors and
was continually, to make herself useful, pushing back her chair
so as to leave more room, holding my gloves, offering me all
those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner
but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or,
instinctively and by force of professional habit, by retired
servants.</p>
<p>But already the Duke, who seemed in a hurry to complete the
round of introduction, had led me off to another of the
flower-maidens. On hearing her name I told her that I had passed
by her country house, not far from Balbec. "Oh, I should have
been so pleased to take you over it," she informed me, almost in
a whisper, to enhance her modesty, but in a tone of deep feeling,
steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite
exceptional pleasure; and went on, with a meaning glance: "I do
hope you will come again some day. But I must say that what would
interest you more still would be my aunt Brancas's place. It was
built by Mansard; it is the jewel of the province." It was not
only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her
house, but her aunt Brancas would have been no less delighted to
do me the honours of hers, or so I was assured by this lady who
thought evidently that, especially at a time when the land shewed
a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no
knowledge of the world, it was important that the great should
keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality, by speeches
which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought,
like everyone in her world, to say the things which would give
most pleasure to the person she was addressing, to give him the
highest idea of himself, to make him think that he flattered
people by writing to them, that he honoured those who entertained
him, that everyone was burning to know him. The desire to give
other people this comforting idea of themselves does, it must be
admitted, exist even among the middle classes. We find there that
kindly disposition, in the form of an individual merit
compensating for some other defect, not alas among the most
trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable
female companions. But there anyhow it blooms only in isolated
patches. In an important section of the aristocracy, on the other
hand, this characteristic has ceased to be individual; cultivated
by education, sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which
can fear no humiliation, which knows no rival, is aware that by
being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so,
it has become the generic feature of a class. And even those whom
personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping
it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their
vocabulary or their gesticulation.</p>
<p>"She is a very good creature," said the Duc de Guermantes, of
the Princesse de Parme, "and she can play the 'great lady' when
she likes, better than anyone."</p>
<p>While I was being introduced to the ladies, one of the
gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of
agitation: this was Comte Hannibal de Bréauté-Consalvi. Arriving
late, he had not had time to investigate the composition of the
party, and when I entered the room, seeing in me a guest who was
not one of the Duchess's regular circle and must therefore have
some quite extraordinary claim to admission, installed his
monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow, thinking that
this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of
man I was. He knew that Mme. de Guermantes possessed (the
priceless appanage of truly superior women) what was called a
'salon,' that is to say added occasionally to the people of her
own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by
the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a
masterpiece. The Faubourg Saint-Germain had not yet recovered
from the shock of learning that, to the reception which she had
given to meet the King and Queen of England, the Duchess had not
been afraid to invite M. Detaille. The clever women of the
Faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable, so
deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact
with that strange genius. Mme. de Courvoisier made out that M.
Ribot had been there as well, but this was a pure invention,
designed to make people believe that Oriane was aiming at an
Embassy for her husband. Finally, a last straw of scandal, M. de
Guermantes, with a gallantry that would have done credit to
Marshal Saxe, had repaired to the green-room of the Comédie
Française, and had begged Mlle. Reichemberg to come and recite
before the King, which having come to pass constituted an event
without precedent in the annals of routs. Remembering all these
surprises, which, moreover, had his entire approval, his own
presence being not merely an ornament but, in the same way as
that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, a consecration to any
drawing-room, M. de Bréauté, when he asked himself who I could
be, felt that the field of exploration was very wide. For a
moment the name of M. Widor flashed before his mind, but he
decided that I was not old enough to be an organist, and M. Widor
not striking enough to be 'asked out.' It seemed on the whole
more plausible to regard me simply as the new Attaché at the
Swedish Legation of whom he had heard, and he was preparing to
ask me for the latest news of Oscar, by whom he had several times
been very hospitably received; but when the Duke, in introducing
me, had mentioned my name to M. de Bréauté, the latter, finding
that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt
that, being where I was, I must be a celebrity Of some sort.
Oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not, and had
the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her
house, in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent,
otherwise she would have lowered its tone. M. de Bréauté began,
therefore, to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily, his
appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could
count, but by the character of the party, which my presence could
not fail to make interesting, and which would furnish him with a
topic for brilliant conversation next day at the Duc de
Chartres's luncheon-table. He had not yet settled in his own mind
whether I was the man who had just been making those experiments
with a serum to cure cancer, or the author of the new
'curtain-raiser' then in rehearsal at the Théâtre Français; but,
a great intellectual, a great collector of 'travellers' tales,'
he continued an ever increasing display of reverences, signs of
mutual understanding, smiles filtered through the glass of his
monocle; either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing
would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me
the illusion that for him, the Comte de Bréauté-Consalvi, the
privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than
those of birth; or simply from the need to express and difficulty
of expressing his satisfaction, in his ignorance of the language
in which he ought to address me, just as if, in fact, he had
found himself face to face with one of the 'natives' of an
undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded, natives from
whom, in the hope of ultimate profit, he would endeavour,
observing with interest the while their quaint customs and
without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship, or like
them uttering loud cries, to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in
exchange for his glass beads. Having responded as best I could to
his joy, I shook hands next with the Duc de Châtellerault, whom I
had already met at Mme. de Villeparisis's, who, he informed me,
was as 'cunning as they made 'em.' He was typically Guermantes in
the fairness of his hair, his arched profile, the points where
the skin of his cheeks lost colour, all of which may be seen in
the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But, as I was no longer in
love with the Duchess, her reincarnation in the person of a young
man offered me no attraction. I interpreted the hook made by the
Duc de Châtellerault's nose, as if it had been the signature of a
painter whose work I had long studied but who no longer
interested me in the least. Next, I said good evening also to the
Prince de Foix, and to the detriment of my knuckles, which
emerged crushed and mangled, let them be caught in a vice which
was the German handclasp, accompanied by an ironical or
good-natured smile, of the Prince von Faffenheim, M. de Norpois's
friend, who, by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed
in this set, was known so universally as Prince Von that he
himself used to sign his letters 'Prince Von,' or, when he wrote
to his intimates, 'Von.' And yet this abbreviation was
understandable, in view of his triple-barrelled name. It was less
easy to grasp the reasons which made 'Elizabeth' be replaced, now
by 'Lili,' now by 'Bebeth,' just as another world swarmed with
'Kikis.' One can realise that these people, albeit in most
respects idle and light-minded enough, might have come to adopt
'Quiou' in order not to waste the precious time that it would
have taken them to pronounce 'Montesquiou.' But it is not so easy
to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins 'Dinand'
instead of 'Ferdinand.' It must not be thought, however, that in
the invention of nicknames the Guermantes invariably proceed to
curtail or reduplicate syllables. Thus two sisters, the Comtesse
de Montpeyroux and the Vicomtesse de Vélude, who were both of
them enormously stout, invariably heard themselves addressed,
without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of
amusement on other people's, so long established was the custom,
as 'Petite' and 'Mignonne.' Mme. de Guermantes, who adored Mme.
de Montpeyroux, would, if her friend had been seriously ill, have
flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed: "I hear
Petite is dreadfully bad!" Mme. de l'Eclin, who wore her hair in
bands that entirely hid her ears, was never called anything but
'The Empty Stomach'; in some cases people simply added an 'a' to
the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife. The
most miserly, most sordid, most inhuman man in the Faubourg
having been christened Raphael, his charmer, his flower springing
also from the rock always signed herself 'Raphaela'&mdash;but
these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules, to
which we can always return later on, if the occasion offers, and
explain some of them. I then asked the Duke to present me to the
Prince d'Agrigente. "What! Do you mean to say you don't know our
excellent Gri-gri!" cried M. de Guermantes, and gave M.
d'Agrigente my name. His own, so often quoted by Françoise, had
always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass
through which I beheld, struck, on the shore of the violet sea,
by the slanting rays of a golden sun, the rosy marble cubes of an
ancient city of which I had not the least doubt that the
Prince&mdash;happening for a miraculous moment to be passing
through Paris&mdash;was himself, as luminously Sicilian and
gloriously mellowed, the absolute sovereign. Alas, the vulgar
drone to whom I was introduced, and who wheeled round to bid me
good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant,
was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he
might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its
beauty, without, perhaps, ever having stopped to examine it. The
Prince d'Agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely,
anything that might make one think of Girgenti that one was led
to suppose that his name, entirely distinct from himself, bound
by no ties to his person, had had the power of attracting to
itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might
have been in this man as in any other, and isolating it, after
the operation, in the enchanted syllables. If any such operation
had been performed, it had certainly been done most efficiently,
for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this
kinsman of Guermantes. With the result that he found himself at
one and the same time the only man in the world who was Prince
d'Agrigente and the man who, of all the men in the world was,
perhaps, least so. He was, for all that, very glad to be what he
was, but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine
without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name
of Ivanhoe or Primrose, or is called merely the Premier.
Meanwhile, as these introductions, which it has taken me so long
to recount but which, beginning as I entered the room, had lasted
only a few seconds, were coming to an end, and Mme. de
Guermantes, in an almost suppliant tone, was saying to me: "I am
sure Basin is tiring you, dragging you round like that; we are
anxious for you to know our friends, but we are a great deal more
anxious not to tire you, so that you may come again often," the
Duke, with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand, gave
(as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last
hour, filled for me by the contemplation of his Elstirs) the
signal that dinner might now be served.</p>
<p>I should add that one of the guests was still missing, M. de
Grouchy, whose wife, a Guermantes by birth, had arrived by
herself, her husband being due to come straight from the country,
where he had been shooting all day. This M. de Grouchy, a
descendant of his namesake of the First Empire, of whom it has
been said, quite wrongly, that his absence at the start of the
Battle of Waterloo was the principal cause of Napoleon's defeat,
came of an excellent family which, however, was not good enough
in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood. Thus the Prince
de Guermantes, whose own tastes, in later life, were to prove
more easily satisfied, had been in the habit of saying to his
nieces: "What a misfortune for that poor Mme. de Guermantes" (the
Vicomtesse de Guermantes, Mme. de Grouchy's mother) "that she has
never succeeded in marrying any of her children." "But, uncle,
the eldest girl married M. de Grouchy." "I do not call that a
husband! However, they say that your uncle François has proposed
for the youngest one, so perhaps they won't all die old maids."
No sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast
gyratory whirr, multiple and simultaneous, the double doors of
the dining-room swung apart; a chamberlain with the air of a Lord
Chamberlain bowed before the Princesse de Parme and announced the
tidings "Madame is served," in a tone such as he would have
employed to say "Madame is dead," which, however, cast no gloom
over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety
and as, in summer, at 'Robinson' that the couples moved forward
one behind another to the dining-room, separating when they had
reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind
them; last of all, Mme. de Guermantes advanced upon me, that I
might lead her to the table, and without my feeling the least
shadow of the timidity that I might have feared, for, like a
huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful
motion an easy thing, observing no doubt that I had placed myself
on the wrong side of her, she pivoted with such accuracy round me
that I found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most
natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements. I yielded
to these with all the more readiness in that the Guermantes
attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly
learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of
a dunce; other doors opened through which there entered the
steaming soup, as though the dinner were being held in a
puppet-theatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of
the young guest set, on a signal from the puppet-master, all the
machinery in motion.</p>
<p>Timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from
the Duke, to which had responded the unlocking of that vast,
ingenious, subservient and sumptuous clockwork, mechanical and
human. The indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the
effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it. For I could
feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the
fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to
begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time, just
as Mme. de Guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many
pictures I would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking
my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow
of introductions. So that it was the absence of grandeur in this
gesture that disclosed its true grandeur. As, also, did that
indifference shewn by the Duke to the splendour of his
surroundings, in contrast to his deference towards a guest,
however insignificant, whom he desired to honour.</p>
<p>Not that M. de Guermantes was not in certain respects
thoroughly commonplace, shewing indeed some of the absurd
weaknesses of a man with too much money, the arrogance of an
upstart, which he certainly was not. But just as a public
official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to
infinity (as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses
behind it) by those forces on which they can rely, the Government
of France and the Catholic Church, so M. de Guermantes was borne
on by that other force, aristocratic courtesy in its truest form.
This courtesy drew the line at any number of people. Mme. de
Guermantes would not have asked to her house Mme. de Cambremer,
or M. de Forcheville. But the moment that anyone (as was the case
with me) appeared eligible for admission into the Guermantes
world, this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity
more splendid still, were that possible, than those historic
rooms, or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them.</p>
<p>When he wished to give pleasure to anyone, M. de Guermantes
possessed, in this way, for making his guest for the moment the
principal person present, an art which made the most of the
circumstances and the place. No doubt at Guermantes his
'distinctions' and 'favours' would have assumed another form. He
would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive, alone
with himself, before dinner. Such as they were, one could not
help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs
of the period by those of Louis XIV when he replies
good-naturedly, smiling and almost with a bow, to some one who
has come to solicit his favour. It must however in both instances
be borne in mind that this 'politeness' did not go beyond the
strict meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Louis XIV (with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his
day find fault, nevertheless, for his scant regard for etiquette,
so much so that, according to Saint-Simon, he was only a very
minor king, as kings go, when compared with such monarchs as
Philippe de Valois or Charles V), has the most minute
instructions drawn up so that Princes of the Blood and
Ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give
precedence. In certain cases, in view of the impossibility of
arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son
of Louis XIV, Monseigneur, shall entertain certain foreign
sovereigns only out of doors, in the open air, so that it may not
be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other;
and the Elector Palatine, entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at
dinner, pretends, so as not to have to make way for his guest, to
be taken ill, and dines with him indeed, but dines lying down,
thus avoiding the difficulty. M. le Duc evading opportunities of
paying his duty to Monsieur the latter, on the advice of the
King, his brother, who is moreover extremely attached to him,
seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and
forcing him to pass him his shirt. But as soon as the feeling is
deep, when the heart is involved, this rule of duty, so
inflexible when politeness only is at stake, changes entirely. A
few hours after the death of his brother, one of the people whom
he most dearly loved, when Monsieur, in the words of the Duc de
Montfort, is 'still warm,' we find Louis XIV singing snatches
from operas, astonished that the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who has
difficulty in concealing her grief, should be looking so
woe-begone, and, desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be
at once resumed, so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit
down to the tables, ordering the Duc de Bourgogne to start a game
of <i>brelan</i>. Well, not only in his social and concentrated
activities, but in the most spontaneous utterances, the ordinary
preoccupations of M. de Guermantes, the use he made of his time,
one found a similar contrast; the Guermantes were no more
susceptible than other mortals to grief; one might indeed say
that their actual sensibility was lower; on the other hand one
saw their names every day in the social columns of the
<i>Gaulois</i> on account of the prodigious number of funerals at
which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their
presence recorded. As the traveller discovers, almost unaltered,
the houses roofed with turf, the terraces which may have met the
eyes of Xenophon or Saint Paul, so in the manners of M. de
Guermantes, a man who melted one's heart by his courtesy and
revolted it by his harshness, I found still intact after the
lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court
life under Louis XIV which transfers all scruples of conscience
from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to
purely formal questions.</p>
<p>The other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the
Princesse de Parme was of a more personal kind. It was that she
was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the
Duchesse de Guermantes's, people and things alike, was of a
quality superior to that of anything that she had at home. It is
true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved
as if this had been the case; over the simplest dish, the most
ordinary flowers, she was not satisfied with going into
ecstasies, she would ask leave to send round next morning, to
copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom, her head
cook or head gardener, gentlemen with large salaries who kept
their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come
to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind
of carnation that was not half so fine, had not such ornamental
streaks, did not produce so large a blossom as those which they
had long been growing for her at home. But if in the Princess,
wherever she went, this astonishment at the sight of the most
commonplace things was assumed, and intended to shew that she did
not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride
forbidden by her early instructors, habitually dissembled by her
mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator, it was, on
the other hand, in all sincerity that she regarded the
drawing-room of the Duchesse de Guermantes as a privileged place
in which she could pass only from surprise to delight. To a
certain extent, for that matter, though not nearly enough to
justify this state of mind, the Guermantes were different from
the rest of noble society, they were rarer and more refined. They
had given me at first sight the opposite impression; I had found
them vulgar, similar to all other men and women, but because
before meeting them I had seen in them, as in Balbec, in
Florence, in Parma, only names. Evidently, in this drawing-room,
all the women whom I had imagined as being like porcelain figures
were even more like the great majority of women. But, in the same
way as Balbec or Florence, the Guermantes, after first
disappointing the imagination because they resembled their
fellow-creatures rather than their name, could subsequently,
though to a less degree, appeal to the intellect by certain
distinctive characteristics. Their bodily structure, the
colour&mdash;a peculiar pink that merged at times into
violet&mdash;of their skins, a certain almost flashing fairness
of the finely spun hair, even in the men, on whom it was massed
in soft golden tufts, half a wall-growing lichen, half a catlike
fur (a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain
brilliance of intellect, for if people spoke of the Guermantes
complexion, the Guermantes hair, they spoke also of the wit of
the Guermantes, as of the wit of the Mortemarts&mdash;a certain
social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the
days of Louis XIV and all the more universally recognised since
they published the fame of it themselves), all this meant that in
the material itself, precious as that might be, in which one
found them embedded here and there, the Guermantes remained
recognisable, easy to detect and to follow, like the veins whose
paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx, or, better still,
like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened
hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a moss-agate.</p>
<p>The Guermantes&mdash;those at least who were worthy of the
name&mdash;were not only of a quality of flesh, of hair, of
transparency of gaze that was exquisite, but had a way of holding
themselves, of walking, of bowing, of looking at one before they
shook one's hand, of shaking hands, which made them as different
in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in
turn was from a peasant in a smock. And despite their
friendliness one asked oneself: "Have they not indeed the right,
though they waive it, when they see us walk, bow, leave a room,
do any of those things which when performed by them become as
graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on
its stem, to think: 'These people are of another race than ours,
and we are, we, the true lords of creation.'?" Later on, I
realised that the Guermantes did indeed regard me as being of
another race, but one that aroused their envy because I possessed
merits of which I knew nothing and which they professed to regard
as alone important. Later still I came to feel that this
profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn
or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy The
physical flexibility essential to the Guermantes was twofold;
thanks to one of its forms, constantly in action, at any moment
and if, for example, a male Guermantes were about to salute a
lady, he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable
equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous
compensations, one leg dragging a little either on purpose or
because, having been broken so often in the hunting-field, it
imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a
deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a
counterpoise, while the monocle settled itself before his eye,
raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was
lowered in the formal bow; the other flexibility, like the form
of the wave, the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on
the shell or the vessel, was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of
fixed mobility, curving the arched nose which, beneath the blue,
protruding eyes, above the over-thin lips, from which, in the
women, there emerged a raucous voice, recalled the fabulous
origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of
parasitic and Hellenising genealogists to his race, ancient
beyond dispute, but not to the degree of antiquity which they
claimed when they gave as its source the mythological
impregnation of a nymph by a divine Bird.</p>
<p>The Guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as
from the physical point of view. With the exception of Prince
Gilbert (the husband with antiquated ideas of 'Marie-Gilbert,'
who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together
because her blood, though royal, was inferior to his
own)&mdash;but he was an exception and furnished, behind his
back, a perpetual laughing-stock to the rest of the family, who
had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him&mdash;the Guermantes,
while living in the pure cream of aristocracy, affected to take
no account of nobility. The theories of the Duchesse de
Guermantes, who, to tell the truth, by dint of being a
Guermantes, became to a certain extent something different and
more attractive, subordinated everything else so completely to
intellect, and were in politics so socialistic that one asked
oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit
whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic
standard of living, and which, always invisible but evidently
crouching at one moment in the entrance hall, at another in the
drawing-room, at a third in her dressing-room, reminded the
servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address
her as Mme. la Duchesse, reminding also herself who cared only
for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner
with her sister-in-law when eight o'clock struck, and to put on a
low gown.</p>
<p>The same familiar spirit represented to Mme. de Guermantes the
social duties of duchesses, of the foremost among them, that was,
who like herself were multi-millionaires, the sacrifice to boring
tea, dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have
read interesting books, as unpleasant necessities like rain,
which Mme. de Guermantes accepted, letting play on them her
biting humour, but without seeking in any way to justify her
acceptance of them. The curious accident by which the butler of
Mme. de Guermantes invariably said "Madame la Duchesse" to this
woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear
to shock her. Never had it entered her head to request him to
address her simply as 'Madame.' Giving her the utmost benefit of
the doubt one might have supposed that, thinking of something
else at the time, she had heard only the word 'Madame' and that
the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention. Only,
though she might feign deafness, she was not dumb. In fact,
whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say
to the butler: "Remind Monsieur le Duc&mdash;"</p>
<p>The familiar spirit had other occupations as well, one of
which was to inspire them to talk morality. It is true that there
were Guermantes who went in for intellect and Guermantes who went
in for morals, and that these two classes did not as a rule
coincide. But the former kind&mdash;including a Guermantes who
had forged cheques, who cheated at cards and was the most
delightful of them all, with a mind open to every new and sound
idea&mdash;spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the
others, and in the same strain as Mme. de Villeparisis, at the
moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the
lips of the old lady. At corresponding moments one saw the
Guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as old-ladylike, as
genial and (as they themselves had more charm) more touching than
that of the Marquise, to say of a servant: "One feels that she
has a thoroughly sound nature, she's not at all a common girl,
she must come of decent parents, she is certainly a girl who has
never gone astray." At such moments the familiar spirit took the
form of an intonation. But at times it could be bearing also, the
expression on a face, the same in the Duchess as in her
grandfather the Marshal, a sort of undefinable convulsion (like
that of the Serpent, the genius of the Carthaginian family of
Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing,
on my morning walks, when before I had recognised Mme. de
Guermantes I felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a
little dairy. This familiar spirit had intervened in a situation
which was far from immaterial not merely to the Guermantes but to
the Courvoisiers, the rival faction of the family and, though of
as good blood as the Guermantes (it was, indeed, through his
Courvoisier grandmother that the Guermantes explained the
obsession which led the Prince de Guermantes always to speak of
birth and titles as though those were the only things that
mattered), their opposite in every respect. Not only did the
Courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as
the Guermantes, they had not the same idea of it. For a
Guermantes (even were he a fool) to be intelligent meant to have
a sharp tongue, to be capable of saying cutting things, to 'get
away with it'; but it meant also the capacity to hold one's own
equally in painting, music, architecture, to speak English. The
Courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of
intelligence, and unless one were actually of their world being
intelligent was almost tantamount to 'having probably murdered
one's father and mother.' For them intelligence was the sort of
burglar's jemmy by means of which people one did not know from
Adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawing-rooms, and it
was common knowledge among the Courvoisiers that you always had
to pay in the long run for having 'those sort' of people in your
house. To the most trivial statements made by intelligent people
who were not 'in society' the Courvoisiers opposed a systematic
distrust. Some one having on one occasion remarked: "But Swann is
younger than Palamède,"&mdash;"He says so, at any rate, and if he
says it you may be sure it's because he thinks it is to his
interest!" had been Mme. de Gallardon's retort. Better still,
when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom
the Guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in
first because she was the elder: "But is she really the elder?"
Mme. de Gallardon had inquired, not positively as though that
sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid
of civil or religious status, of definite traditions, they were
both more or less young, like two kittens of the same litter
between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide.
The Courvoisiers, more than the Guermantes, maintained also in a
certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to
the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts.
Just as the Guermantes (for whom, below the royal families and a
few others like the Lignes, the La Trémoïlles and so forth, all
the rest were lost in a common rubbish-heap) were insolent
towards various people of long descent who lived round
Guermantes, simply because they paid no attention to those
secondary distinctions by which the Courvoisiers were enormously
impressed, so the absence of such distinctions affected them
little. Certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank
in their native provinces but, brilliantly married, rich,
good-looking, beloved of Duchesses, were for Paris, where people
are never very well up in who one's 'father and mother' were, an
excellent and exclusive piece of 'imported goods.' It might
happen, though not commonly, that such women were, through the
channel of the Princesse de Parme or by virtue of their own
attractions, received by certain Guermantes. But with regard to
these the indignation of the Courvoisiers knew no bounds. Having
to meet, between five and six in the afternoon, at their
cousin's, people with whose relatives their own relatives did not
care to be seen mixing down in the Perche became for them an
ever-increasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of
rhetoric. The moment, for instance, when the charming Comtesse
G&mdash;&mdash; entered the Guermantes drawing-room, the face of
Mme. de Villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have
befitted it had she been called to recite the line:</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">And should but one stand fast,
that one were surely I,</p>
<p>a line which for that matter was unknown to her. This
Courvoisier had consumed almost every Monday an <i>éclair</i>
stuffed with cream within a few feet of the Comtesse
G&mdash;&mdash;, but to no consequence. And Mme. de Villebon
confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin
Guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in
the second-best society of Châteaudun. "I really fail to see why
my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows; it's
making a perfect farce of society!" concluded Mme. de Villebon
with a change of facial expression, this time a sly smile of
despair, which, in a charade, would have been interpreted rather
as indicating another line of poetry, though one with which she
was no more familiar than with the first:</p>
<p align="center"><i>Grâce aux Dieux mon malheur passe mon
espérance</i>.</p>
<p>We may here anticipate events to explain that the
<i>persévérance</i>, (which rhymes, in the following line with
<i>espérance</i>) shewn by Mme. de Villebon in snubbing Mme.
G&mdash;&mdash; was not entirely wasted. In the eyes of Mme.
G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; it invested Mme. de Villebon with a
distinction so supreme, though purely imaginary, that when the
time came for Mme. G&mdash;&mdash;'s daughter, who was the
prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that
season, to marry, people were astonished to see her refuse all
the Dukes in succession. The fact was that her mother,
remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the
Rue de Grenelle on account of Châteaudun could think of only one
possible husband for her daughter&mdash;a Villebon son.</p>
<p>A single point at which Guermantes and Courvoisiers converged
was the art (one, for that matter, of infinite variety) of
marking distances. The Guermantes manners were not absolutely
uniform towards everyone. And yet, to take an example, all the
Guermantes, all those who really were Guermantes, when you were
introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost
as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been
as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood. At the
moment when a Guermantes, were he no more than twenty, but
treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors, heard your
name uttered by the person who introduced you, he let fall on you
as though he had by no means made up his mind to say "How d'ye
do?" a gaze generally blue, always of the coldness of a steel
blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses
of your heart. Which was a matter of fact what the Guermantes
imagined themselves to be doing, each of them regarding himself
as a psychologist of the highest order. They thought moreover
that they increased by this inspection the affability of the
salute which was to follow it, and would not be rendered you
without full knowledge of your deserts. All this occurred at a
distance from yourself which, little enough had it been a
question of a passage of arms, seemed immense for a handclasp,
and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other,
so that when the Guermantes, after a rapid twisting thrust that
explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare
your title to honour, had deemed you worthy to associate with him
thereafter, his hand, directed towards you at the end of an arm
stretched out to its fullest extent, appeared to be presenting a
rapier at you for a single combat, and that hand was in fact
placed so far in advance of the Guermantes himself at that moment
that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to
distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was
saluting. Certain Guermantes, lacking the sense of proportion, or
being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves
incessantly, went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every
time that they met you. Seeing that they had no longer any need
to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which
the 'familiar spirit' had delegated its powers to them and the
result of which they had presumably kept in mind, the insistence
of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be
explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or
by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to
possess. The Courvoisiers whose physique was different, had tried
in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall
back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference On the other
hand, it was from the Courvoisiers that certain very exceptional
Guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the
feminine form of greeting. At the moment when you were presented
to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried
towards you, almost to an angle of forty-five degrees, her head
and bust, the rest of her body (which came very high, up to the
belt which formed a pivot) remaining stationary. But no sooner
had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person
than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden
retirement through almost the same angle. This subsequent
withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to
you; the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did
not even remain a conquest, as in a duel; the original positions
were retained. This same annulment of affability by the
resumption of distance (which was Courvoisier in origin and
intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement
were no more than a momentary feint) displayed itself equally
clearly, in the Courvoisier ladies as in the Guermantes, in the
letters which you received from them, at any rate in the first
period of your acquaintance. The 'body' of the letter might
contain sentences such as one writes only (you would suppose) to
a friend, but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to
boast of being in that relation to the lady, since the letter
began with '<i>Monsieur</i>,' and ended with 'Croyez monsieur À
mes sentiments distingués.' After which, between this cold
opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all
the rest, there might come in succession (were it a reply to a
letter of condolence from yourself) the most touching pictures of
the grief which the Guermantes lady had felt on losing her
sister, of the intimacy that had existed between them, of the
beauty of the place in which she was staying, of the consolation
that she found in the charm of her young children, all this
amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed
collections, the intimate character of which implied, however, no
more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had
been the Younger Pliny or Mme. de Simiane.</p>
<p>It is true that certain Guermantes ladies wrote to you from
the first as 'My dear friend,' or 'My friends'; these were not
always the most simple natured among them, but rather those who,
living only in the society of kings and being at the same time
'light,' assumed in their pride the certainty that everything
which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption
the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that
they had to offer. However, since to have had a common ancestor
in the reign of Louis XIII was enough to make a young Guermantes
say, in speaking of the Marquise de Guermantes: "My aunt Adam,"
the Guermantes were so numerous a clan that, even among these
simple rites, that for example of the bow upon introduction to a
stranger, there existed a wide divergence. Each subsection of any
refinement had its own, which was handed down from parents to
children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of
making jam. Thus it was that we saw Saint-Loup's handclasp thrust
out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one's
name, without any participation by his eyes, without the addition
of a bow. Any unfortunate commoner who for a particular
reason&mdash;which, for that matter, very rarely
occurred&mdash;was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup
subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a
greeting, which deliberately assumed the appearance of
non-recognition, to discover what in the world the
Guermantes&mdash;male or female&mdash;could have against him. And
he was highly surprised to learn that the said Guermantes had
thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how
delighted he or she had been with the stranger, whom he or she
looked forward to meeting again. As specialised as the mechanical
gestures of Saint-Loup were the complicated and rapid capers
(which M. de Charlus condemned as ridiculous) of the Marquis de
Fierbois, the grave and measured paces of the Prince de
Guermantes. But it is impossible to describe here the richness of
the choreography of the Guermantes ballet owing to the sheer
length of the cast.</p>
<p>To return to the antipathy which animated the Courvoisiers
against the Duchesse de Guermantes, they might have had the
consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still
unmarried, for she was then comparatively poor. Unfortunately, at
all times and seasons, a sort of fuliginous emanation, quite
<i>sut generis</i>, enveloped, hid from the eye the wealth of the
Courvoisiers which, however great it might be, remained obscure.
In vain might a young Courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most
eligible bridegroom; it invariably happened that the young couple
had no house of their own in Paris, 'came up to stay' in the
season with his parents, and for the rest of the year lived down
in the country in the thick of a society that may have been
unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished. Whereas a
Saint-Loup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled Doncières with
his carriage-horses, a Courvoisier who was extremely rich always
went in the tram. Similarly (though of course many years earlier)
Mlle. de Guermantes (Oriane), who had scarcely a penny to her
name, created more stir with her clothes than all the
Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said
gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing
her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand
Duke: "Well, Sir, I hear you would like to have Tolstoy
murdered?" at a dinner-party to which none of the Courvoisiers,
not that any of them knew very much about Tolstoy, had been
asked. They knew little more about Greek writers, if we may judge
by the Dowager Duchesse de Gallardon (mother-in-law of the
Princesse de Gallardon who at that time was still a girl) who,
not having been honoured by Oriane with a single visit in five
years, replied to some one who asked her the reason for this
abstention: "It seems she recites Aristotle" (meaning
Aristophanes) "in society. I cannot allow that sort of thing in
my house!"</p>
<p>One can imagine how greatly this 'sally' by Mlle. de
Guermantes upon Tolstoy, if it enraged the Courvoisiers,
delighted the Guermantes, and by derivation everyone who was not
merely closely but even remotely attached to them. The Dowager
Comtesse d'Argencourt (<i>née</i> Seineport) who entertained a
little of everything, because she was a blue-stocking and in
spite of her son's being a terrible snob, repeated the saying
before her literary friends with the comment: "Oriane de
Guermantes, you know; she's as fine as amber, as mischievous as a
monkey, there's nothing she couldn't do if she chose, her
water-colours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better
verses than most of the great poets, and as for family, don't you
know, you couldn't imagine anything better, her grandmother was
Mlle. de Montpensier, and she is the eighteenth Oriane de
Guermantes in succession, without a single misalliance; it's the
purest blood, the oldest in the whole of France." And so the sham
men of letters, those demi-intellectuals who went to Mme.
d'Argencourt's, forming a mental picture of Oriane de Guermantes,
whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally, as
something more wonderful and more extraordinary than Princess
Badroulbadour, not only felt themselves ready to die for her on
learning that so noble a person glorified Tolstoy above all
others, but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their
minds their own love of Tolstoy, their longing to fight against
Tsarism. These liberal ideas might have grown faint in them, they
might have begun to doubt their importance, no longer venturing
to confess to holding them, when suddenly from Mlle. de
Guermantes herself, that is to say from a girl so indisputably
cultured and authorised to speak, who wore her hair flat on her
brow (a thing that no Courvoisier would ever have consented to
do), came this vehement support. A certain number of realities,
good or bad in themselves, gain enormously in this way by
receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us.
For instance among the Courvoisiers the rites of affability in a
public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow, very ugly and far
from affable in itself but which people knew to be the
distinguished way of bidding a person good day, with the result
that everyone else, suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome
on his own face, endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics.
But the Guermantes in general and Oriane in particular, while
better conversant than anyone with these rites, did not hesitate,
if they caught sight of you from a carriage, to greet you with a
sprightly wave of the hand, and in a drawing-room, leaving the
Courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows, sketched
charming reverences in the air, held out their hands as though to
a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes, so that suddenly,
thanks to the Guermantes, there entered into the substance of
smartness, until then a little hollow and dry, everything that
you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to
forego, a genuine welcome, the effusion of a true friendliness,
spontaneity. It is in a similar fashion (but by a rehabilitation
which this time is scarcely justified) that people who carry in
themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies,
however commonplace, which have in them something easy and
caressing, succeed, by dint of education in symphonic culture, in
mortifying that appetite. But once they have arrived at this
point, when, dazzled&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;by the brilliant
orchestral colouring of Richard Strauss, they see that musician
adopt with an indulgence worthy of Auber the most vulgar motifs,
what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an
authority a justification which delights them, and they let
themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold
gratitude, when they listen to <i>Salomé</i>, by what it would
have been impossible for them to admire in <i>Les Diamants de la
Couronne</i>.</p>
<p>Authentic or not, the retort made by Mlle. de Guermantes to
the Grand Duke, retailed from house to house, furnished an
opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which Oriane
had been turned out at the dinner-party in question. But if such
splendour (and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by
the Courvoisiers) springs not from wealth but from prodigality,
the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the
constant support of the former, which allows it to spend all its
fire. Given the principles openly advertised not only by Oriane
but by Mlle. de Villeparisis, namely that nobility does not
count, that it is ridiculous to bother one's head about rank,
that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness, that intellect,
heart, talent are alone of importance, the Courvoisiers were
justified in hoping that, as a result of the training she had
received from the Marquise, Oriane would marry some one who was
not in society, an artist, a fugitive from justice, a scalliwag,
a free-thinker, that she would pass definitely into the category
of what the Courvoisiers called 'detrimentals.' They were all the
more justified in this hope since, inasmuch as Mme. de
Villeparisis was at this very moment, from the social point of
view, passing through an awkward crisis (none of the few bright
stars whom I was to meet in her drawing-room had as yet
reappeared there), she professed an intense horror of the society
which was thus holding her aloof. Even when she referred to her
nephew the Prince de Guermantes, whom she did still see, she
could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so
infatuated about his pedigree. But the moment it became a
question of finding a husband for Oriane, it had been no longer
the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had
controlled the operations, it had been the mysterious 'familiar
spirit' of their race. As unerringly as if Mme. de Villeparisis
and Oriane had never spoken of anything but rent-rolls and
pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character, and
as if the Marquise, for the space of a few days, had
been&mdash;as she would ultimately be&mdash;dead and on her bier,
in the church of Combray, where each member of the family would
be reduced to a mere Guermantes, with a forfeiture of
individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the
voluminous black drapery of the pall the single 'G' in purple
surmounted by the ducal coronet, it was on the wealthiest man and
the most nobly born, on the most eligible bachelor of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the eldest son of the Duc de
Guermantes, the Prince des Laumes, that the familiar spirit had
let fall the choice of the intellectual, the critical, the
evangelical Mme. de Villeparisis. And for a couple of hours, on
the day of the wedding, Mme. de Villeparisis received in her
drawing-room all the noble persons at whom she had been in the
habit of sneering, at whom she indeed sneered still to the
various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the
Prince des Laumes promptly left cards, preparatory to 'cutting
the cable' in the following year. And then, making the
Courvoisiers' cup of bitterness overflow, the same old maxims,
which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to
social pre-eminence, resumed their doctrinal fore in the
household of the Princesse des Laumes immediately after her
marriage. And in this respect, be it said in passing, the point
of view which Saint-Loup upheld when he lived with Rachel,
frequented the friends of Rachel, would have liked to marry
Rachel, implied&mdash;whatever the horror that it inspired in the
family&mdash;less falsehood than that of the Guermantes young
ladies in general, preaching the virtues of intellect, barely
admitting the possibility of anyone's questioning the equality of
mankind, all of which ended at a given point in the same result
as if they had professed the opposite principles, that is to say
in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke. Saint-Loup did, on the
contrary, act in conformity with his theories which led people to
say that he was treading in evil ways. Certainly from the moral
standpoint Rachel was not altogether satisfactory. But it is by
no means certain whether, if she had been some person no more
worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions, Mme. de
Marsantes would not have been in favour of the match.</p>
<p>Well, to return to Mme. des Laumes (shortly afterwards
Duchesse de Guermantes, on the death of her father-in-law), it
was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the Courvoisiers
that the theories of the young Princess, remaining thus lodged in
her speech, should not in any sense be guiding her conduct; with
the result that this philosophy (if one may so call it) in no way
impaired the aristocratic smartness of the Guermantes
drawing-room. No doubt all the people whom Mme. de Guermantes did
not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever
enough, and some rich American lady who had never had any book in
her possession except a little old copy, never opened, of Parny's
poems, arranged because it was of the 'period' upon one of the
tables in her inner room, shewed how much importance she attached
to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she
fastened on the Duchesse de Guermantes when that lady made her
appearance at the Opera. No doubt, also, Mme. de Guermantes was
sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her
intellect. When she said of a woman: "It appears, she's quite
charming!" or of a man that he was the "cleverest person in the
world," she imagined herself to have no other reason for
consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness, the
familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more
deeply rooted, stationed at the obscure entry of the region in
which the Guermantes exercised their judgment, this vigilant
spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman
charming if they had no social value, actual or potential. The
man was pronounced learned, but like a dictionary, or, on the
contrary, common, with the mind of a commercial traveller, the
woman pretty, but with a terribly bad style, or too talkative. As
for the people who had no definite position, they were simply
dreadful&mdash;such snobs! M. de Bréauté, whose country house was
quite close to Guermantes, mixed with no one below the rank of
Highness. But he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to
spend his days in museums. Accordingly Mme. de Guermantes was
indignant when anyone spoke of M. de Bréauté as a snob. "A snob!
Babal! But, my poor friend, you must be mad, it's just the
opposite. He loathes smart people; he won't let himself be
introduced to anyone. Even in my house! If I ask him to meet some
one he doesn't know, he swears at me all the time." This was not
to say that, even in practice, the Guermantes did not adopt an
entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the
Courvoisiers. In a positive sense, this difference between the
Guermantes and the Courvoisiers had begun already to bear very
promising fruit. Thus the Duchesse de Guermantes, enveloped
moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her
at a respectful distance, had given that party to which I have
already referred, at which the King of England had enjoyed
himself more thoroughly than anywhere else, for she had had the
idea, which would never have occurred to a Courvoisier mind, of
inviting, and the audacity, from which a Courvoisier courage
would have recoiled, to invite, apart from the personages already
mentioned, the musician Gaston Lemaire and the dramatist
Grandmougin. But it was pre-eminently from the negative point of
view that intellectuality made itself felt. If the necessary
coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank
of the person who sought an invitation from the Princesse des
Laumes became more exalted, vanishing into zero when he or she
was one of the principal Crowned Heads of Europe, conversely the
farther they fell below this royal level the higher the
coefficient rose. For instance at the Princesse de Parme's
parties there were a number of people whom her Royal Highness
invited because she had known them as children, or because they
were related to some duchess, or attached to the person of some
Sovereign, they themselves being quite possibly ugly, boring or
stupid; well, with a Courvoisier any of the reasons: "a favourite
of the Princesse de Parme," "a niece on the mother's side of the
Duchesse d'Arpajon," "spends three months every year with the
Queen of Spain," would have been sufficient to make her invite
such people to her house, but Mme. de Guermantes, who had
politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the Princesse
de Parme's, had never once allowed them to cross her threshold,
considering that the same rule applied to a drawing-room in a
social as in a material sense, where it only needed a few pieces
of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there
to fill the room and as a sign of the owner's wealth, to render
it hideous. Such a drawing-room resembled a book in which the
author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his
own learning, brilliance, fluency. Like a book, like a house, the
quality of a 'salon,' thought Mme. de Guermantes&mdash;and
rightly&mdash;is based on the corner-stone of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Many of the friends of the Princesse de Parme, with whom the
Duchesse de Guermantes had confined herself for years past to the
same conventional greeting, or to returning their cards, without
ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs, complained
discreetly of these omissions to her Highness who, on days when
M. de Guermantes came by himself to see her, passed on a hint to
him. But the wily nobleman, a bad husband to the Duchess in so
far as he kept mistresses, but her most tried and trusty friend
in everything that concerned the good order of her drawing-room
(and her own wit, which formed its chief attraction), replied:
"But doe my wife know her? Indeed! Oh, well, I daresay she does.
But the truth is, Ma'am, that Oriane does not care for women's
conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior
minds&mdash;I am not her husband, I am only the first footman.
Except for quite a small number, who are all of them very clever
indeed, women bore her. Surely, Ma'am, your Highness with all her
fine judgment is not going to tell me that the Marquise de Souvré
has any brains. Yes, I quite understand, the Princess receives
her out of kindness. Besides, your Highness knows her. You tell
me that Oriane has met her; it is quite possible, but once or
twice at the most I assure you. And then, I must explain to your
Highness, it is really a little my fault as well. My wife is very
easily tired, and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if
I allowed her she would never stop going to see people. Only
yesterday evening she had a temperature, she was afraid of
hurting the Duchesse de Bourbon's feelings by not going to see
her. I had to shew my teeth, I assure you; I positively forbade
them to bring the carriage round. Do you know, Ma'am, I should
really prefer not to mention to Oriane that you have spoken to me
about Mme. de Souvré. My wife is so devoted to your Highness, she
will go round at once to invite Mme. de Souvré to the house; that
will mean another call to be paid, it will oblige us to make
friends with the sister, whose husband I know quite well. I think
I shall say nothing at all about it to Oriane, if the Princess
has no objection. That will save her a great deal of strain and
excitement. And I assure you that it will be no loss to Mme. de
Souvré. She goes everywhere, moves in the most brilliant circles.
You know, we don't entertain at all, really, just a few little
friendly dinners, Mme. de Souvré would be bored to death." The
Princesse de Parme, innocently convinced that the Duc de
Guermantes would not transmit her request to his Duchess, and
dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that Mme. de
Souvré sought, was all the more flattered to think that she
herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a
household. No doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also.
Thus whenever the Princesse de Parme invited Mme. de Guermantes
to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that
there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the
Duchess and make her refuse to come again.</p>
<p>On ordinary evenings (after dinner, at which she invariably
entertained at a very early hour, for she clung to old customs, a
small party) the drawing-room of the Princesse de Parme was
thrown open to her regular guests, and, generally speaking, to
all the higher ranks of the aristocracy, French and foreign. The
order of her receptions was as follows: on issuing from the
dining-room the Princess sat down on a sofa before a large round
table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who
had dined with her, or else cast her eyes over a magazine, or
sometimes played cards (or pretended to play, adopting a German
court custom), either a game of patience by herself or selecting
as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage. By
nine o'clock the double doors of the big drawing-room were in a
state of perpetual agitation, opening and shutting and opening
again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home (or if
they had dined in town hurried from their café promising to
return later, since they intended only to go in at one door and
out at the other) in order to conform with the Princess's
time-table. She, meanwhile, her mind fixed on her game or
conversation, made a show of not seeing the new arrivals, and it
was not until they were actually within reach of her that she
rose graciously from her seat, with a friendly smile for the
women. The latter thereupon sank before the upright Presence in a
courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion, so as to bring
their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung
very low, and to kiss it. But at that moment the Princess, just
as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which
nevertheless she was perfectly familiar, raised the kneeling
figure as though by main force, and with incomparable grace and
sweetness, and kissed her on both cheeks. A grace and sweetness
that were conditional, you may say, upon the meekness with which
the arriving guest inclined her knee. Very likely; and it seems
that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would
vanish, not, as is generally supposed, from want of breeding, but
because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a
distinction which must be imaginary to be effective, and, more
completely still, from the other class the affability in the
distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to
be, to the recipient, of an untold value which, in a world based
on equality, would at once fall to nothing like everything that
has only a promissory worth. But this disappearance of politeness
in a reconstructed society is by no means certain, and we are at
times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible
state of things. People of first-rate intelligence have held the
opinion that a Republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign
alliances, and, more recently, that the peasant class would not
tolerate the separation of Church and State. After all, the
survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would
be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway
or the use of the aeroplane in war. Besides, even if politeness
were to vanish, there is nothing to shew that this would be a
misfortune. Lastly, would not society become secretly more
hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic? This seems
highly probable. The political power of the Popes has grown
enormously since they ceased to possess either States or an Army;
our cathedrals meant far less to a devout Catholic of the
seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the
twentieth, and if the Princesse de Parme had been the sovereign
ruler of a State, no doubt I should have felt myself impelled to
speak of her almost as I should speak of a President of the
Republic, that is to say not at all.</p>
<p>As soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and
embraced by the Princess, the latter resumed her seat and
returned to her game of patience, but first of all, if the
newcomer were of any importance, held her for a moment in
conversation, making her sit down in an armchair.</p>
<p>When the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had
to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular
guests into an immense hall on to which the drawing-room opened,
a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the House of
Bourbon. The intimate friends of the Princess would then
volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting
anecdotes, to which the young people had not the patience to
listen, more interested in the spectacle of living Royalties
(with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by
the lady in waiting and the maids of honour) than in examining
the relics of dead Sovereigns. Too much occupied with the
acquaintances which they would be able to form and the
invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure, they knew
absolutely nothing, even in after-years, of what there was in
this priceless museum of the archives of the Monarchy, and could
only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant
palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the
palmarium in the Jardin d'Acclimatation.</p>
<p>Naturally the Duchesse de Guermantes, by way of
self-mortification, did occasionally appear on these evenings to
pay an 'after dinner' call on the Princess, who kept her all the
time by her side, while she rallied the Duke. But on evenings
when the Duchess came to dine, the Princess took care not to
invite her regular party, and closed her doors to the world on
rising from table, for fear lest a too liberal selection of
guests might offend the exacting Duchess. On such evenings, were
any of the faithful who had not received warning to present
themselves on the royal doorstep, they would be informed by the
porter: "Her Royal Highness is not at home this evening," and
would turn away. But, long before this, many of the Princess's
friends had known that, on the day in question, they would not be
asked to her house. These were a special set of parties, a
privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission.
The excluded could, with a practical certainty, enumerate the
roll of the elect, and would say irritably among themselves: "You
know, of course, that Oriane de Guermantes never goes anywhere
without her entire staff." With the help of this body the
Princesse de Parme sought to surround the Duchess as with a
protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose
making a good impression on her was at all doubtful. But with
several of the Duchess's favourites, with several members of this
glittering 'staff,' the Princesse de Parme resented having to go
out of her way to shew them attentions, seeing that they paid
little or no attention to herself. No doubt the Princess was
fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more
enjoyment in the company of the Duchesse de Guermantes than in
her own. She could not deny that there was always a 'crush' on
the Duchess's at-home days, or that she herself often met there
three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave
their cards upon her. And in vain might she commit to memory
Oriane's witty sayings, copy her gowns, serve at her own tea
parties the same strawberry tarts, there were occasions on which
she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and
some foreign Counsellor of Legation. And so whenever (as had been
the case with Swann, for instance, at an earlier period) there
was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an
hour or two at the Duchess's and paid a call once in two years on
the Princesse de Parme, the latter felt no great desire, even for
the sake of amusing Oriane, to make to this Swann or whoever he
was the 'advances' of an invitation to dinner. In a word, having
the Duchess in her house was for the Princess a source of endless
perplexity, so haunted was she by the fear that Oriane would find
fault with everything. But in return, and for the same reason,
when the Princesse de Parme came to dine with Mme. de Guermantes
she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect,
delightful, she had only one fear which was that of her own
inability to understand, remember, give satisfaction, her
inability to assimilate new ideas and people. On this account my
presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity, just as
might a new way of decorating the dinner-table with festoons of
fruit, uncertain as she was which of the two it might
be&mdash;the table decorations or my presence&mdash;that was the
more distinctively one of those charms, the secret of the success
of Oriane's parties, and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to
try at her own next dinner-party to introduce them both. What for
that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the
Princesse de Parme brought to the Duchess's house was that
element&mdash;amusing, dangerous, exciting&mdash;into which the
Princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety, shock and
delight (as at the seaside on one of those days of 'big waves' of
the danger of which the bathing-masters warn us, simply and
solely because none of them knows how to swim), from which she
used to emerge terrified, happy, rejuvenated, and which was known
as the wit of the Guermantes. The wit of the Guermantes&mdash;a
thing as non-existent as the squared circle, according to the
Duchess who regarded herself as the sole Guermantes to possess
it&mdash;was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of
Tours or the biscuits of Rheims. No doubt (since an intellectual
peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same
channels as a shade of hair or complexion) certain intimate
friends of the Duchess who were not of her blood were
nevertheless endowed with this wit, which on the other hand had
failed to permeate the minds of various Guermantes, too
refractory to assimilate wit of any kind. The holders, not
related to the Duchess, of this Guermantes wit had generally the
characteristic feature of having been brilliant men, fitted for a
career to which, whether it were in the arts, diplomacy,
parliamentary eloquence or the army, they had preferred the life
of a small and intimate group. Possibly this preference could be
explained by a certain want of originality, of initiative, of
will power, of health or of luck, or possibly by
snobbishness.</p>
<p>With certain people (though these, it must be admitted, were
the exception) if the Guermantes drawing-room had been the
stumbling-block in their careers, it had been without their
knowledge. Thus a doctor, a painter and a diplomat of great
promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which
they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of
their competitors because their friendship with the Guermantes
had the result that the two former were regarded as men of
fashion and the third as a reactionary, which had prevented each
of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues. The
mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the
electoral colleges of the Faculties are (or were at least, not so
long since) something more than a purely outward survival from a
narrow-minded past, from a rigid sectarianism. Under the cap with
its golden tassels, like the High Priest in the conical mitre of
the Jews, the 'Professors' were still, in the years that preceded
the Dreyfus case, fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas. Du
Boulbon was at heart an artist, but was safe because he did not
care for society. Cottard was always at the Verdurins'. But Mme.
Verdurin was a patient; besides, he was protected by his
vulgarity; finally, at his own house he entertained no one
outside the Faculty, at banquets over which there floated an
aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations, where moreover
the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be
paid for the noblest integrity, the most lofty conceptions of
morality, which weaken in an atmosphere that, more tolerant,
freer at first, becomes very soon dissolute, a Professor in his
gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine, like that of a Doge
(which is to say a Duke) of Venice enshrined in the Ducal Palace,
was as virtuous, as deeply attached to noble principles, but as
unsparing of any alien element as that other Duke, excellent but
terrible, whom we know as M. de Saint-Simon. The alien, here, was
the worldly doctor, with other manners, other social relations.
To make good, the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking, so as
not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them (the
strange ideas of a man of fashion!) if he concealed from them his
Duchesse de Guermantes, hoped to disarm them by giving mixed
dinner-parties in which the medical element was merged in the
fashionable. He was unaware that in so doing he signed his own
death-warrant, or rather he discovered this later, when the
Council of Ten had to fill a vacant chair, and it was invariably
the name of another doctor, more normal, it might be obviously
inferior, that leaped from the fatal urn, when their 'Veto'
thundered from the ancient Faculty, as solemn, as absurd and as
terrible as the 'Juro' that spelled the death of Molière. So too
with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion, when
fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making
themselves be labelled artists; so with the diplomat who had too
many reactionary associations.</p>
<p>But this case was the rarest of all. The type of distinguished
man who formed the main substance of the Guermantes drawing-room
was that of people who had voluntarily (or so at least they
supposed) renounced all else, everything that was incompatible
with the wit of the Guermantes, with the courtesy of the
Guermantes, with that indefinable charm odious to any
'Corporation' however little centralised.</p>
<p>And the people who were aware that in days gone by one of
these frequenters of the Duchess's drawing-room had been awarded
the gold medal of the Salon, that another, Secretary to the Bar
Council, had made a brilliant start in the Chamber, that a third
had ably served France as Chargé d'Affaires, might have been led
to regard as 'failures' people who had done nothing more now for
twenty years. But there were few who were thus 'well-informed,'
and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to
remind people, finding these old distinctions to be now
valueless, in the light of this very Guermantes spirit of wit:
for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher, and
as a counter-jumper a pair of eminent Ministers, one a trifle
solemn, the other addicted to puns, of whose praises the
newspapers were always full but in whose company Mme. de
Guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if
the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her
at the dinner-table. Since being a statesman of the first rank
was in no sense a recommendation to the Duchess's favour, those
of her friends who had definitely abandoned the 'Career' or the
'Service,' who had never stood for the Chamber, felt, as they
came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great
friend, or when they met her in the houses of Royal Personages,
of whom for that matter they thought very little (or at least
they said so), that they themselves had chosen the better part,
albeit their melancholy air, even in the midst of the gaiety,
seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion.</p>
<p>It must be recognised also that the refinement of social life,
the subtlety of conversation at the Guermantes' did also contain,
exiguous as it may have been, an element of reality. No official
title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of
Mme. de Guermantes, whom the most powerful Ministers had been
unable to attract to their houses. If in this drawing-room so
many intellectual ambitions, such noble efforts even had been for
ever buried, still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms
of civilised society had taken life. Certainly men of wit, Swann
for instance, regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine
worth, whom they despised, but that was because what the Duchesse
de Guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect; it
was, according to her, that superior, more exquisite form of the
human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent&mdash;wit.
And long ago at the Verdurins' when Swann condemned Brichot and
Elstir, one as a pedant and the other as a clown, despite all the
learning of one and the other's genius, it was the infiltration
of the Guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so.
Never would he have dared to present either of them to the
Duchess, conscious instinctively of the air with which she would
have listened to Brichot's monologues and Elstir's
hair-splittings, the Guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and
prolix speech, whether in a serious or a farcical vein, as alike
of the most intolerable imbecility.</p>
<p>As for the Guermantes of the true flesh and blood, if the
Guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see
occur in, to take an example, those literary circles in which
everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words, of
expressing his thoughts, and consequently of thinking, it was
certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social
groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation. But imitation
depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable
originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which
enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to
imitate. Whereas there were several Guermantes in whom this
musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the Courvoisiers.</p>
<p>To take as an instance what is called, in another sense of the
word imitation, 'giving imitations' (or among the Guermantes was
called 'taking off'), Mme. de Guermantes might succeed in this to
perfection, the Courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating
her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and
women, because they had never had the sense to observe the
particular defect or accent that the Duchess was endeavouring to
copy. When she 'gave an imitation' of the Duc de Limoges, the
Courvoisiers would protest: "Oh, no, he doesn't really speak like
that! I met him again only yesterday at dinner at Bebeth's; he
talked to me all evening and he didn't speak like that at all!"
whereas the Guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed: "Gad,
what fun Oriane is! The odd part of it is that when she is
copying him she looks exactly like him! I feel I'm listening to
him. Oriane, do give us a little more Limoges!" Now these
Guermantes (and not necessarily the few really outstanding
members of the clan who when the Duchess imitated the Duc de
Limoges, would say admiringly' "Oh, you really have got him," or
"You do get him,") might indeed be devoid of wit according to
Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet, by
dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to
imitate more or less her way of expressing herself, of
criticising people of what Swann, like the Duke himself, used to
call her 'phrasing' of things so that they presented in their
conversation something which to the Courvoisiers appeared
'fearfully like' Oriane's wit and was treated by them
collectively as the 'wit of the Guermantes.' As these Guermantes
were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers, Oriane (who kept
the rest of the family rigorously at arm's-length and now avenged
by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her
girlhood) went to call on them now and then, generally in company
with the Duke, in the season, when she drove out with him. These
visits were historic events. The heart began to beat more rapidly
in the bosom of the Princesse d'Epinay, who was 'at home' in her
big drawing-room on the ground floor, when she perceived afar
off, like the first glow of an innocuous fire, or the
'reconnaissances' of an unexpected invasion, making her way
across the courtyard slowly, in a diagonal course, the Duchess
crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from
which there rained down a summer fragrance. "Why, here comes
Oriane," she would say, like an 'On guard!' intended to convey a
prudent warning to her visitors, so that they should have time to
beat an orderly retreat, to clear the rooms without panic. Half
of those present dared not remain, and rose at once to go. "But
no, why? Sit down again, I insist on keeping you a little
longer," said the Princess in a careless tone and seemingly at
her ease (to shew herself the great lady) but in a voice that
suddenly rang false. "But you may want to talk to each other."
"Really, you're in a hurry? Oh, very well, I shall come and see
you," replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as
well pleased to see depart. The Duke and Duchess gave a very
civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for
years, without for that reason coming to know them any better,
while these in return barely said good day to them, thinking this
more discreet. Scarcely had they left the room before the Duke
began asking good-naturedly who they were, so as to appear to be
taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he
himself, owing to the cross-purposes of fate or the wretched
state of Oriane's nerves, never saw in his own house. "Tell me,
who was that little woman in the pink hat?" "Why, my dear cousin,
you have seen her hundreds of times, she's the Vicomtesse de
Tours, who was a Lamarzelle." "But, do you know, she's quite
good-looking; she seems clever too; if it weren't for a little
flaw in her upper lip she'd be a regular charmer. If there's a
Vicomte de Tours, he can't have any too bad a time. Oriane, do
you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded
me of? Your cousin Hedwige de Ligne." The Duchesse de Guermantes,
who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman
other than herself, let the conversation drop. She had reckoned
without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that
he knew all about the people who did not come to his house,
whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously
minded than his wife. '"But," he resumed suddenly with emphasis,
"you mentioned the name Lamarzelle. I remember, when I was in the
Chamber, hearing a really remarkable speech
made.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "That was the uncle of the young
woman you saw just now." "Indeed! What talent! No, my dear girl,"
he assured the Vicomtesse d'Egremont, whom Mme. de Guermantes
could not endure, but who, refusing to stir from the Princesse
d'Epinay's drawing-room where she willingly humbled herself to
play the part of parlour-maid (and was ready to slap her own
parlour-maid on returning home), stayed there, confused, tearful,
but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room, took their
cloaks, tried to make herself useful, offered discreetly to
withdraw into the next room, "you are not to make tea for us, let
us just sit and talk quietly, we are simple souls, really,
honestly. Besides," he went on, turning to the Princesse d'Epinay
(leaving the Egremont lady blushing, humble, ambitious and full
of zeal), "we can only give you a quarter of an hour." This
quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of
exhibition of the witty things which the Duchess had said during
the previous week, and to which she herself would certainly not
have referred had not her husband, with great adroitness, by
appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that
had provoked them, obliged her as though against her will to
repeat them.</p>
<p>The Princesse d'Epinay, who was fond of her cousin and knew
that she had a weakness for compliments, went into ecstasies over
her hat, her sunshade, her wit. "Talk to her as much as you like
about her clothes," said the Duke in the sullen tone which he had
adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his
resentment should not be taken seriously, "but for heaven's sake
don't speak of her wit, I should be only too glad not to have so
witty a wife. You are probably alluding to the shocking pun she
made about my brother Palamède," he went on, knowing quite well
that the Princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard
this pun, and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his
wife. "In the first place I consider it unworthy of a person who
has occasionally, I must admit, said some quite good things, to
make bad puns, but especially about my brother, who is very
susceptible, and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with
me, that would really be too much of a good thing." "But we never
heard a word about it! One of Oriane's puns! It's sure to be
delicious. Oh, do tell us!" "No, no," the Duke went on, still
sulking though with a broader smile, "I'm so glad you haven't
heard it. Seriously, I'm very fond of my brother." "Listen,
Basin," broke in the Duchess, the moment having come for her to
take up her husband's cue, "I can't think why you should say that
it might annoy Palamède, you know quite well it would do nothing
of the sort. He is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid
joke which has nothing offensive about it. You are making them
think I said something nasty; I simply uttered a remark which was
not in the least funny, it is you who make it seem important by
losing your temper over it. I don't understand you." "You are
making us terribly excited, what is it all about?" "Oh, obviously
nothing serious!" cried M. de Guermantes. "You may have heard
that my brother offered to give Brézé, the place he got from his
wife, to his sister Marsantes." "Yes, but we were told that she
didn't want it, she didn't care for that part of the country, the
climate didn't suit her." "Very well, some one had been telling
my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this
place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease
her. 'He's such a teaser, Charlus,' was what they actually said.
Well, you know Brézé, it's a royal domain, I should say it's
worth millions, it used to be part of the crown lands, it
includes one of the finest forests in the whole of France. There
are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased
to that tune. And so when she heard the word 'teaser' applied to
Charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property,
Oriane could not help exclaiming, without meaning anything, I
must admit, there wasn't a trace of ill-nature about it, for it
came like a flash of lightning: 'Teaser, teaser? Then he must be
Teaser Augustus.' You understand," he went on, resuming his sulky
tone, having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order
to judge the effect of his wife's witticism&mdash;and in some
doubt as to the extent of Mme. d'Epinay's acquaintance with
ancient history, "you understand, it's an allusion to Augustus
Caesar, the Roman Emperor; it's too stupid, a bad play on words,
quite unworthy of Oriane. And then, you see, I am more
circumspect than my wife, if I haven't her wit, I think of the
consequences; if anyone should be so ill-advised as to repeat the
remark to my brother there'll be the devil to pay. All the more,"
he went on, "because as you know Palamède is very high and
mighty, and very fussy also, given to gossip and all that sort of
thing, so that quite apart from the question of his giving away
Brézé you must admit that 'Teaser Augustus' suits him down to the
ground. That is what justifies my wife's remarks; even when she
is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar, she is always
witty and does really describe people."</p>
<p>And so, thanks on one occasion to 'Teaser Augustus,' on
another to something else, the visits paid by the Duke and
Duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes, and
the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the
departure of the sparkling lady and her 'producer.' Her hostess
would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who
had been at the entertainment (those who had remained in the
room) the clever things that Oriane had said. "You hadn't heard
'Teaser Augustus'?" asked the Princesse d'Epinay. "Yes," replied
the Marquise de Baveno, blushing as she spoke, "the Princesse de
Sarsina (the La Rochefoucauld one) mentioned it to me, not quite
in the same words. But of course it was far more interesting to
hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room," she went
on, as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the
composer himself. "We were speaking of Oriane's latest&mdash;she
was here just now," her hostess greeted a visitor who would be
plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier. "What!
Has Oriane been here?" "Yes, you ought to have come a little
sooner," the Princesse d'Epinay informed her, not in reproach but
letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss.
It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the
Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho's last performance.
"What do you think of Oriane's latest? I must say, I do enjoy
'Teaser Augustus'," and the 'saying' would be served up again
cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were
invited on purpose, and would reappear under various sauces
throughout the week. Indeed the Princess happening in the course
of that week to pay her annual visit to the Princesse de Parme
seized the opportunity to ask whether her Royal Highness had
heard the pun, and repeated it to her. "Ah! Teaser Augustus,"
said the Princesse de Parme, her eyes bulging with an instinctive
admiration, which begged however for a complementary elucidation
which Mme. d'Epinay was not loath to furnish. "I must say,
'Teaser Augustus' pleases me enormously as a piece of
'phrasing'," she concluded. As a matter of fact the word
'phrasing' was not in the least applicable to this pun, but the
Princesse d'Epinay, who claimed to have assimilated her share of
the Guermantes spirit, had borrowed from Oriane the expressions
'phrased' and 'phrasing' and employed them without much
discrimination. New the Princesse de Parme, who was not at all
fond of Mme. d'Epinay, whom she considered plain, knew to be
miserly and believed, on the authority of the Courvoisiers, to be
malicious, recognised this word 'phrasing' which she had heard
used by Mme. de Guermantes but would not by herself have known
how or when to apply. She received the impression that it was in
fact its 'phrasing' that formed the charm of 'Teaser Augustus'
and, without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the
plain and miserly lady, could not repress a burst of admiration
for a person endowed to such a degree with the Guermantes spirit,
so strong that she was on the point of inviting the Princesse
d'Epinay to the Opera. She was held in check only by the
reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult Mme. de
Guermantes first. As for Mme. d'Epinay, who, unlike the
Courvoisiers, paid endless attentions to Oriane and was genuinely
fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly
irritated by the fun which the Duchess used to make of her before
everyone on account of her meanness, she reported on her return
home what an effort it had required to make the Princesse de
Parme grasp the point of 'Teaser Augustus,' and declared what a
snob Oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends. "I
should never have been able to see much of the Princesse de Parme
even if I had cared to," she informed the friends who were dining
with her. "M. d'Epinay would not have allowed it for a moment,
because of her immorality," she explained, alluding to certain
purely imaginary excesses on the part of the Princess. "But even
if I had had a husband less strict in his views, I must say I
could never have made friends with her. I don't know how Oriane
can bear to see her every other day, as she does. I go there once
a year, and it's all I can do to sit out my call." As for those
of the Courvoisiers who happened to be at Victurnienne's on the
day of Mme. de Guermantes's visit, the arrival of the Duchess
generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt
at the 'ridiculous salaams' that were made to her there. One
alone remained on the afternoon of 'Teaser Augustus.' He did not
entirely see the point, but he did see part of it, being an
educated man. And the Courvoisiers went about repeating that
Oriane had called uncle Palamède 'Caesar Augustus,' which was,
according to them, a good enough description of him, but why all
this endless talk about Oriane, they went on People couldn't make
more fuss about a queen. "After all, what is Oriane? I don't say
that the Guermantes aren't an old family, but the Courvoisiers
are every bit as good in rank, antiquity, marriages. We mustn't
forget that on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when the King of
England asked François I who was the noblest of the lords there
present, 'Sire,' said the King of France, 'Courvoisier.'" But
even if all the Courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them,
Oriane's sayings would have fallen on deaf ears, since the
incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have
been regarded by them from a totally different point of view. If,
for instance, a Courvoisier found herself running short of
chairs, in the middle of a party, or if she used the wrong name
in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember, or if one of
her servants said something stupid, the Courvoisier, extremely
annoyed, flushed, quivering with excitement, would deplore so
unfortunate an occurrence. And when she had a visitor in the room
and Oriane was expected, she would say in a tone anxiously and
imperiously questioning: "Do you know her?", fearing that if the
visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate
impression on Oriane. But Mme. de Guermantes on the contrary
extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which
made the Guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their
cheeks, so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short
of chairs, having herself made or having allowed her servant to
make a blunder, having had at her party some one whom nobody
knew, as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have
been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their
humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct
stimulus of their genius, at any rate the subject matter of their
works.</p>
<p>The Courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the
spirit of innovation which the Duchesse de Guermantes introduced
into the life of society and, by adapting it, following an
unerring instinct, to the necessities of the moment, made into
something artistic where the purely rational application of cut
and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would
greet a man who, anxious to succeed in love or in politics, was
to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of Bussy
d'Amboise. If the Courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner
to meet some prince, the addition of a recognised wit, of some
friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of
producing the direst consequences. A Courvoisier whose father had
been a Minister of the Empire having to give an afternoon party
to meet Princesse Mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that
she could invite no one but Bonapartists. Of whom she knew
practically none. All the smart women of her acquaintance, all
the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because, from their
Legitimist views or connexions, they might easily, according to
Courvoisier logic, give offence to the Imperial Highness. The
latter, who in her own house entertained the flower of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, was quite surprised when she found at
Mme. de Courvoisier's only a notorious old sponger whose husband
had been an Imperial Prefect, the widow of the Director of Posts
and sundry others known for their loyalty to Napoleon, their
stupidity and their dullness. Princesse Mathilde, however, in no
way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign
grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the Duchesse de
Guermantes, for her part, took good care not to invite when it
was her turn to entertain the Princess, but substituted for them
without any abstract reasoning about Bonapartism the most
brilliant coruscation of all the beauties, all the talents, all
the celebrities, who, the exercise of some subtle sixth sense
made her feel, would be acceptable to the niece of the Emperor
even when they belonged actually to the Royal House. There was
not lacking indeed the Duc d'Aumale, and when on withdrawing the
Princess, raising Mme. de Guermantes from the ground where she
had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand,
embraced her on both cheeks, it was from the bottom of her heart
that she was able to assure the Duchess that never had she spent
a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party. The Princesse
de Parme was Courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in
social matters, but unlike the Courvoisiers the surprise that was
perpetually caused her by the Duchesse de Guermantes engendered
in her not, as in them, antipathy but admiration. This
astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely
backward state of the Princess's education. Mme. de Guermantes
was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed. But it
was enough for her to have gone a little beyond Mme. de Parme to
stupefy that lady, and, as the critics of each generation confine
themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths
admitted by their predecessors, she had only to say that
Flaubert, that arch-enemy of the bourgeois, had been bourgeois
through and through, or that there was a great deal of Italian
music in Wagner, to open before the Princess, at the cost of a
nervous exhaustion which recurred every time, as before the eyes
of a swimmer in a stormy sea, horizons that seemed to her
unimaginable and remained for ever vague. A stupefaction caused
also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of
art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social
events. No doubt the incapacity that prevented Mme. de Parme from
distinguishing the true wit of the Guermantes from certain
rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit (which made her believe
in the high intellectual worth of certain, especially certain
female Guermantes, of whom she was bewildered on hearing the
Duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere
blockheads) was one of the causes of the astonishment which the
Princess always felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes criticise
other people. But there was another cause also, one which I, who
knew at this time more books than people and literature better
than life, explained to myself by thinking that the Duchess,
living this worldly life the idleness and sterility of which are
to a true social activity what criticism, in art, is to creation,
extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of
point of view, the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a
mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what
paradox that is still fairly new, and will make no bones about
upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great
<i>Iphigénie</i> is Piccini's and not Gluck's, at a pinch the
true <i>Phèdre</i> that of Pradon.</p>
<p>When a woman who was intelligent, educated, witty had married
a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard, Mme. de
Guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure
not only in decrying the wife but in 'discovering' the husband.
In the Cambremer household for example, if she had lived in that
section of society at the time, she would have decreed that Mme.
de Cambremer was stupid, and that the really interesting person,
misunderstood, delightful, condemned to silence by a chattering
wife but himself worth a thousand of her, was the Marquis, and
the Duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of
refreshment as the critic who, after people have for seventy
years been admiring <i>Hernani</i>, confesses to a preference for
<i>Le Lion Amoureux</i>. And from this same morbid need of
arbitrary novelties, if from her girlhood everyone had been
pitying a model wife, a true saint, for being married to a
scoundrel, one fine day Mme. de Guermantes would assert that this
scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of
gold, whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do
the most inconsistent things. I knew that it is not only over
different works, in the long course of centuries, but over
different parts of the same work that criticism plays, thrusting
back into the shadow what for too long has been thought
brilliant, and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to
permanent obscurity. I had not only seen Bellini, Winterhalter,
the Jesuit architects, a Restoration cabinetmaker come to take
the place of men of genius who were called 'worn out,' simply
because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals, as
neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing; I had seen
preferred in Sainte-Beuve alternately the critic and the poet,
Musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite
unimportant little pieces. No doubt certain essayists are
mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in <i>Le
Cid</i> or <i>Polyeucte</i> some speech from <i>Le Menteur</i>
which, like an old plan, furnishes information about the Paris of
the day, but their predilection, justified if not by
considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest, is
still too rational for our criticism run mad. It will barter the
whole of Molière for a line from <i>L'Etourdi</i>, and even when
it pronounces Wagner's <i>Tristan</i> a bore will except a
'charming note on the horns' at the point where the hunt goes by.
This depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which
Mme. de Guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of
their world, recognised as a good fellow but a fool, was a
monster of egoism, sharper than people thought&mdash;that another
widely known for his generosity might be the personification of
avarice, that a good mother paid no attention to her children,
and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really
actuated by the noblest feelings. As though spoiled by the
nullity of life in society, the intelligence and perception of
Mme. de Guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow
pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation (leaving her still
ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness
which she had in turn sought out and abandoned) and for the charm
which she had felt in some warm-hearted man not to change, if he
came too often to see her, sought too freely from her directions
which she was incapable of giving him, into an irritation which
she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact
due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does
nothing else than seek it. The variations of the Duchess's
judgment spared no one, except her husband. He alone had never
been in love with her, in him she had always felt an iron
character, indifferent to the caprices that she displayed,
contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would never
bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find
tranquillity. M. de Guermantes on the other hand, pursuing a
single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom
he constantly replaced, had, once he had left them, and to
express derision of them, only an associate, permanent and
identical, who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom
he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful, the
most virtuous, the cleverest, the best-read member of the
aristocracy, as a wife whom he, M. de Guermantes, was only too
fortunate to have found, who cloaked all his irregularities,
entertained like no one else in the world, and upheld for their
drawing-room its position as the premier in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain. This common opinion he himself shared; often moved
to ill-humour against her, he was proud of her. If, being as
niggardly as he was fastidious, he refused her the most trifling
sums for her charities or for the servants, yet he insisted upon
her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the
best horses in Paris. Whenever Mme. de Guermantes had just
perpetrated, with reference to the merits and defects, which she
suddenly transposed, of one of their friends, a new and succulent
paradox, she burned to make trial of it before people capable of
relishing it, to bring out its psychological originality and to
set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling. No doubt these new
opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old, often
less; but this very element, arbitrary and incalculable, of
novelty which they contained conferred on them something
intellectual which made the communication of them exciting. Only
the patient on whom the Duchess was exercising her psychological
skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to
whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware
that he was not still at the apex of her favour; thus the
reputation that Mme. de Guermantes had of being an incomparable
friend, sentimental, tender and devoted, made it difficult for
her to launch the attack herself; she could at the most intervene
later on, as though under constraint, by uttering a response to
appease, to contradict in appearance but actually to support a
partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her; this was
precisely the part in which M. de Guermantes excelled.</p>
<p>As for social activities, it was yet another form of pleasure,
arbitrary and spectacular, that Mme. de Guermantes felt in
uttering, with regard to them, those unexpected judgments which
pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the
Princesse de Parme. But with this one of the Duchess's pleasures
it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by
following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates
that I tried to understand in what it might consist. The
successive and contradictory edicts by which Mme. de Guermantes
continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her
world no longer sufficing to distract her, she sought also in the
manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour, in which
she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion,
to taste those artificial emotions, to fulfil those adventitious
obligations which stimulate the perceptions of Parliaments and
gain hold of the minds of politicians. We know that when a
Minister explains to the Chamber that he believed himself to be
acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does, as a
matter of fact, appear quite straightforward to the commonsense
person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the
sitting, this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself
suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in
approving the Minister's conduct when he sees that the latter's
speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively
agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such
as: "It's most serious!" ejaculated by a Deputy whose name and
titles are so long, and followed in the report by movements so
emphatic that in the whole interruption the words "It's most
serious!" occupy less room than a hemistich does in an
alexandrine. For instance in the days when M. de Guermantes,
Prince des Laumes, sat in the Chamber, one used to read now and
then in the Paris newspapers, albeit it was intended primarily
for the Méséglise division, to shew the electors there that they
had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless
mandatory:</p>
<blockquote>(Monsieur de Guermantes-Bouillon, Prince des Laumes:
"This is serious!" "Hear, hear!" from the Centre and some of the
Right benches, loud exclamations from the Extreme
Left.)</blockquote>
<p>The commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the
sage Minister, but his heart is convulsed with a fresh
palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to
reply:</p>
<blockquote>"The astonishment, it is not too much to say the
stupor" (keen sensation on the Right side of the House) "that I
have felt at the words of one who is still, I presume, a member
of the Government" (thunder of
applause).&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Several Under-Secretaries of
State for Posts and Telegraphs without Deputies then crowded
round the Ministerial bench. Then rising from his seat, nodded
his head in the affirmative.</blockquote>
<p>This 'thunder of applause' carries away the last shred of
resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader; he discovers to
be an insult to the Chamber, monstrous in fact, a course of
procedure which in itself is of no importance; it may be some
normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than
the poor, bringing to light some piece of injustice, preferring
peace to war; he will find it scandalous and will see in it an
offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had
never given a thought, which are not engraved on the human heart,
but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which
they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble.</p>
<p>It must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of
the politician which served to explain to me the Guermantes
circle, and other groups in society later on, is nothing more
than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often
described as 'reading between the lines.' If in representative
assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this
quality, there is equally stupidity, through the want of it, in
the public who take everything 'literally,' who do not suspect a
dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office 'at his
own request,' and say: "He cannot have been dismissed, since it
was he who asked leave to retire,"&mdash;a defeat when the
Russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger
position that has been prepared beforehand, a refusal when, a
Province having demanded its independence from the German
Emperor, he grants it religious autonomy. It is possible,
moreover (to return to these sittings of the Chamber), that when
they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person
who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers
on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister,
they may ask one another innocently: "There now, I wonder what
they can have been saying; let's hope it's all settled," at the
moment when the Minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn
silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play.
The first words of the Minister: "There is no necessity for me to
inform the Chamber that I have too high a sense of what is the
duty of the Government to have received a deputation of which the
authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance," produce a
dramatic effect, for this was the one hypothesis which the
commonsense of the Deputies had not imagined. But precisely
because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause
that it is only after several minutes have passed that the
Minister can succeed in making himself heard, the Minister who
will receive on returning to his place on the bench the
congratulations of his colleagues. We are as deeply moved as on
the day when the same Minister failed to invite to a big official
reception the President of the Municipal Council who was
supporting the Opposition, and declare that on this occasion as
on the other he has acted with true statesmanship.</p>
<p>M. de Guermantes at this period in his life had, to the great
scandal of the Courvoisiers, frequently been among the crowd of
Deputies who came forward to congratulate the Minister. I have
heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing
a fairly important part in the Chamber and was being thought of
in connexion with Ministerial office or an Embassy he was, when a
friend came to ask a favour of him, infinitely more simple,
behaved politically a great deal less like the important
political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be Duc
de Guermantes. For if he said that nobility made no difference,
that he regarded his fellow Deputies as equals, he did not
believe it for a moment. He sought, pretended to value but really
despised political importance, and as he remained in his own eyes
M. de Guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead
weight of high office which makes other politicians
unapproachable. And in this way his pride guarded against every
assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious
familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually
have.</p>
<p>To return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are
made by politicians, Mme. de Guermantes was no less disconcerting
to the Guermantes, the Courvoisiers, the Faubourg in general and,
more than anyone, the Princesse de Parme by her habit of issuing
unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent
principles which impressed one all the more, the less one
expected them. If the new Greek Minister have a fancy dress ball,
everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the Duchess
would wear. One thought that she would appear as the Duchesse de
Bourgogne, another suggested as probable the guise of Princess of
Dujabar, a third Psyche. Finally, a Courvoisier having asked her:
"What are you going to wear, Oriane?" provoked the one response
of which nobody had thought: "Why, nothing at all!" which at once
set every tongue wagging, as revealing Oriane's opinion as to the
true social position of the new Greek Minister and the proper
attitude to adopt towards him, that is to say the opinion which
ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess 'was not
expected' to attend the fancy dress ball given by this new
Minister: "I do not see that there is any necessity to go to the
Greek Minister's; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should
I go to these people's house, I have nothing to do with them?"
said the Duchess. "But everybody will be there, they say it's
going to be charming!" cried Mme. de Gallardon. "Still, it's just
as charming sometimes to sit by one's own fireside," replied Mme.
de Guermantes. The Courvoisiers could not get over this, but the
Guermantes, without copying it, approved of their cousin's
attitude. "Naturally, everybody isn't in a position like Oriane
to break with all the conventions. But if you look at it in one
way you can't say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that
we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all
these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where." Naturally,
knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would
not fail to provoke, Mme. de Guermantes took as much pleasure in
appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count
on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at
the play with her husband on the night of a party to which
'everybody was going,' or, again, when people imagined that she
would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem, by
stealing into the room without a single jewel, and in another
style of dress than what had been, wrongly, supposed to be
essential to the occasion. Albeit she was anti-Dreyfusard (while
retaining her belief in the innocence of Dreyfus, just as she
spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract
ideas) she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the
Princesse de Ligne's, first of all by remaining seated after all
the ladies had risen to their feet as General Mercier entered the
room, and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her
carriage when a Nationalist orator had begun to address the
gathering, thereby shewing that she did not consider that society
was meant for talking politics; all heads were turned towards her
at a Good Friday concert at which, although a Voltairean, she had
not remained because she thought it indecent to bring Christ upon
the stage. We know how important, even for the great queens of
society, is that moment of the year at which the round of
entertainment begins: so much so that the Marquise d'Amoncourt,
who, from a need to say something, a form of mania, and also from
want of perception, was always making a fool of herself, had
actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her
on the death of her father, M. de Montmorency: "What makes it
sadder still is that it should come at a time when one's mirror
is simply stuffed with cards!" Very well, at this point in the
social year, when people invited the Duchesse de Guermantes to
dinner, making every effort to see that she was not already
engaged, she declined, for the one reason of which nobody in
society would ever have thought; she was just starting on a
cruise among the Norwegian fjords, which were so interesting.
People in society were stupefied, and, without any thought of
following the Duchess's example, derived nevertheless from her
action that sense of relief which one has in reading Kant when
after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds
that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom.
Every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites
the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it.
That of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the
employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year
called 'the season.' The idea that anyone could voluntarily
renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons, twice as many afternoon
teas, three times as many evening parties, the most brilliant
Mondays at the Opera and Tuesdays at the Français to visit the
Norwegian fjords seemed to the Courvoisiers no more explicable
than the idea of <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>,
but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and
charm. So that not a day passed on which somebody might not be
heard to ask, not merely: "You've heard Oriane's latest joke?"
but "You know Oriane's latest?" and on 'Oriane's latest' as on
'Oriane's latest joke' would follow the comment: "How typical of
Oriane!" "Isn't that pure Oriane?" Oriane's latest might be, for
instance, that, having to write on behalf of a patriotic society
to Cardinal X&mdash;, Bishop of Mâcon (whom M. de Guermantes when
he spoke of him invariably called 'Monsieur de Mascon,' thinking
this to be 'old French'), when everyone was trying to imagine
what form the letter would take, and had no difficulty as to the
opening words, the choice lying between 'Eminence,' and
'Monseigneur,' but was puzzled as to the rest, Oriane's letter,
to the general astonishment, began: 'Monsieur le Cardinal,'
following an old academic form, or: 'My Cousin,' this term being
in use among the Princes of the Church, the Guermantes and
Crowned Heads, who prayed to God to take each and all of them
into 'His fit and holy keeping.' To start people on the topic of
an 'Oriane's latest' it was sufficient that at a performance at
which all Paris was present and a most charming play was being
given, when they looked for Mme. de Guermantes in the boxes of
the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Guermantes, countless
other ladies who had invited her, they discovered her sitting by
herself, in black, with a tiny hat on her head, in a stall in
which she had arrived before the curtain rose. "You hear better,
when it's a play that's worth listening to," she explained, to
the scandal of the Courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of
the Guermantes and the Princesse de Parme, who suddenly
discovered that the 'fashion' of hearing the beginning of a play
was more up to date, was a proof of greater originality and
intelligence (which need not astonish them, coming from Oriane)
than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinner-party
and 'going on' somewhere first. Such were the various kinds of
surprise for which the Princesse de Parme knew that she ought to
be prepared if she put a literary or social question to Mme. de
Guermantes, one result of which was that during these
dinner-parties at Oriane's her Royal Highness never ventured upon
the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence
of the bather emerging from between two breakers.</p>
<p>Among the elements which, absent from the three or four other
more or less equivalent drawing-rooms that set the fashion for
the Faubourg Saint-Germain, differentiated from them that of the
Duchesse de Guermantes, just as Leibniz allows that each monad,
while reflecting the entire universe, adds to it something of its
own, one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one
or two extremely good-looking women who had no title to be there
apart from their beauty and the use that M. de Guermantes had
made of them, and whose presence revealed at once, as does in
other drawing-rooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable
pictures, that in this household the husband was an ardent
appreciator of feminine graces. They were all more or less alike,
for the Duke had a taste for large women, at once statuesque and
loose-limbed, of a type half-way between the Venus of Milo and
the Samothracian Victory; often fair, rarely dark, sometimes
auburn, like the most recent, who was at this dinner, that
Vicomtesse d'Arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long
time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams
daily (which slightly annoyed the Duchess), corresponded with her
by carrier pigeon when he was at Guermantes, and from whom
moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away
that, one winter which he had had to spend at Parma, he travelled
back regularly every week to Paris, spending two days in the
train, in order to see her.</p>
<p>As a rule these handsome 'supers' had been his mistresses but
were no longer (as was Mme. d'Arpajon's case) or were on the
point of ceasing to be so. It may well have been that the
importance which the Duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope
of being invited to her house, though they themselves came of
thoroughly aristocratic, but still not quite first-class stock,
had prompted them, even more than the good looks and generosity
of the Duke, to yield to his desires. Not that the Duchess would
have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing
her threshold: she was aware that in more than one of them she
had found an ally, thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand
things which she wanted but which M. de Guermantes pitilessly
denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else.
And so the reason why they were not invited by the Duchess until
their intimacy with the Duke was already far advanced lay
principally in the fact that he, every time that he had embarked
on the deep waters of love, had imagined nothing more than a
brief flirtation, as a reward for which he considered an
invitation from his wife to be more than adequate. And yet he
found himself offering this as the price of far less, for a first
kiss in fact, because a resistance upon which he had never
reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no
resistance. In love it often happens that gratitude, the desire
to give pleasure, makes us generous beyond the limits of what the
other person's expectation and self-interest could have
anticipated. But then the realisation of this offer was hindered
by conflicting circumstances. In the first place, all the women
who had responded to M. de Guermantes's love, and sometimes even
when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him, he had, one
after another, segregated from the world. He no longer allowed
them to see anyone, spent almost all his time in their company,
looked after the education of their children to whom now and
again, if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later
on, he had occasion to present a little brother or sister. And so
if, at the start of the connexion, the prospect of an
introduction to Mme. de Guermantes, which had never crossed the
mind of the Duke, had entered considerably into the thoughts of
his mistress, their connexion had by itself altered the whole of
the lady's point of view; the Duke was no longer for her merely
the husband of the smartest woman in Paris, but a man with whom
his new mistress was in love, a man moreover who had given her
the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of
living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of
questions of social and of material advantage; while now and then
a composite jealousy, into which all these factors entered, of
Mme. de Guermantes animated the Duke's mistresses. But this case
was the rarest of all; besides, when the day appointed for the
introduction at length arrived (at a point when as a rule the
Duke had lost practically all interest in the matter, his
actions, like everyone's else, being generally dictated by
previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to
exist), it frequently happened that it was Mme. de Guermantes who
had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped,
and so greatly needed, to discover, against her dread husband, a
valuable ally. This is not to say that, save at rare moments, in
their own house, where, when the Duchess talked too much, he let
fall a few words or, more dreadful still, preserved a silence
which rendered her speechless, M. de Guermantes failed in his
outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the
forms. People who did not know them might easily misunderstand.
Sometimes between the racing at Deauville, the course of waters
and the return to Guermantes for the shooting, in the few weeks
which people spend in Paris, since the Duchess had a liking for
café-concerts, the Duke would go with her to spend the evening at
one of these. The audience remarked at once, in one of those
little open boxes in which there is just room for two, this
Hercules in his 'smoking' (for in France we give to everything
that is more or less British the one name that it happens not to
bear in England), his monocle screwed in his eye, in his plump
but finely shaped hand, on the ring-finger of which there glowed
a sapphire, a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff
of smoke, keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but,
when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was
absolutely no one whom he knew, softening them with an air of
gentleness, reserve, courtesy and consideration. When a verse
struck him as amusing and not too indecent, the Duke would turn
round with a smile to his wife, letting her share, by a twinkle
of good-natured understanding, the innocent merriment which the
new song had aroused in himself. And the spectators might believe
that there was no better husband in the world than this, nor
anyone more enviable than the Duchess&mdash;that woman outside
whom every interest in the Duke's life lay, that woman with whom
he was not in love, to whom he had been consistently unfaithful;
when the Duchess felt tired, they saw M. de Guermantes rise, put
on her cloak with his own hands, arranging her necklaces so that
they did not catch in the lining, and clear a path for her to the
street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she
received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in
such behaviour simply conventional politeness, at times even with
the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has
no illusion left to shatter. But despite these externals (another
element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the
depths of our being to the surface, at a period already remote
but still continuing for its survivors) the life of the Duchess
was by no means easy. M. de Guermantes never became generous or
human save for a new mistress who would take, as it generally
happened, the Duchess's part; the latter saw becoming possible
for her once again generosities towards inferiors, charities to
the poor, even for herself, later on, a new and sumptuous
motor-car. But from the irritation which developed as a rule
pretty rapidly in Mme. de Guermantes at people whom she found too
submissive the Duke's mistresses were not exempt. Presently the
Duchess grew tired of them. Simultaneously, at this moment, the
Duke's intimacy with Mme. d'Arpajon was drawing to an end.
Another mistress dawned on the horizon.</p>
<p>No doubt the love which M. de Guermantes had had for each of
them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt
afresh; in the first place, this love in dying bequeathed them,
like beautiful marbles&mdash;marbles beautiful to the Duke,
become thus in part an artist, because he had loved them and was
sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated
without love&mdash;which brought into juxtaposition in the
Duchess's drawing-room their forms long inimical, devoured by
jealousies and quarrels, and finally reconciled in the peace of
friendship; besides, this friendship itself was an effect of the
love which had made M. de Guermantes observe in those who were
his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are
perceptible only to the sensual eye, so much so that the
ex-mistress, become 'the best of comrades' who would do anything
in the world for one, is as recognised a type as the doctor or
father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend. But during a
period of transition the woman whom M. de Guermantes was
preparing to abandon bewailed her lot, made scenes, shewed
herself exacting, appeared indiscreet, became a nuisance. The
Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had
an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined
defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman, Mme.
de Guermantes received the telephone messages, the confidences,
the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint. She
laughed at them, first with her husband, then with a few chosen
friends. And imagining that this pity which she shewed for the
poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her, even to her
face, whatever the lady might say, provided it could be included
among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the
puke and Duchess had recently fabricated for her, Mme. de
Guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a
glance of ironical connivance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as she sat down to table, the Princesse de Parme
remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other
Princess to the Opera, and, wishing to be assured that this would
not in any way offend Mme. de Guermantes, was preparing to sound
her. At this moment there entered M. de Grouchy, whose train,
owing to some block on the line, had been held up for an hour. He
made what excuses he could. His wife, had she been a Courvoisier,
would have died of shame. But Mme. de Grouchy was not a
Guermantes for nothing. As her husband was apologising for being
late:</p>
<p>"I see," she broke in, "that even in little things arriving
late is a tradition in your family."</p>
<p>"Sit down, Grouchy, and don't let them pull your leg," said
the Duke.</p>
<p>"I hope I move with the times, still I must admit that the
Battle of Waterloo had its points, since it brought about the
Restoration of the Bourbons, and better still in a way which made
them unpopular. But you seem to be a regular Nimrod!"</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I have had quite a good bag. I
shall take the liberty of sending the Duchess six brace of
pheasants to-morrow."</p>
<p>An idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of Mme. de Guermantes.
She insisted that M. de Grouchy must not give himself the trouble
of sending the pheasants. And making a sign to the betrothed
footman with whom I had exchanged a few words on my way from the
Elstir room:</p>
<p>"Poullein," she told him, "you will go to-morrow and fetch M.
le Comte's pheasants and bring them straight back&mdash;you won't
mind, will you, Grouchy, if I make a few little presents. Basin
and I can't eat a whole dozen by ourselves."</p>
<p>"But the day after to-morrow will be soon enough," said M. de
Grouchy.</p>
<p>"No, to-morrow suits me better," the Duchess insisted.</p>
<p>Poullein had turned pale; his appointment with his sweetheart
would have to be missed. This was quite enough for the diversion
of the Duchess, who liked to appear to be taking a human interest
in everyone. "I know it's your day out," she went on to Poullein,
"all you've got to do is to change with Georges; he can take
to-morrow off and stay in the day after."</p>
<p>But the day after, Poullein's sweetheart would not be free. A
holiday then was of no account to him. As soon as he was out of
the room, everyone complimented the Duchess on the interest she
took in her servants. "But I only behave towards them as I like
people to behave to me." "That's just it. They can say they've
found a good place with you." "Oh, nothing so very wonderful. But
I think they all like me. That one is a little annoying because
he's in love. He thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a
long face."</p>
<p>At this point Poullein reappeared. "You're quite right," said
M. de Grouchy, "he doesn't look much like smiling. With those
fellows one has to be good but not too good." "I admit I'm not a
very dreadful mistress. He'll have nothing to do all day but call
for your pheasants, sit in the house doing nothing and eat his
share of them." "There are plenty of people who would be glad to
be in his place," said M. de Grouchy, for envy makes men
blind.</p>
<p>"Oriane," began the Princesse de Parme, "I had a visit the
other day from your cousin Heudicourt; of course she's a highly
intelligent woman&mdash;she's a Guermantes, one can say no more,
but they tell me she has a spiteful tongue." The Duke fastened on
his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction. Mme. de
Guermantes began to smile. Gradually the Princess became aware of
their pantomime. "But.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. do you mean to
say you don't agree with me?" she stammered with growing
uneasiness. "Really Ma'am, it's too good of you to pay any
attention to Basin's faces. Now' Basin, you're not to hint nasty
things about our cousins." "He thinks her too wicked?" inquired
the Princess briskly. "Oh, dear me, no!" replied the Duchess. "I
don't know who told your Highness that she was spiteful. On the
contrary, she's an excellent creature who never said any harm of
anyone, or did any harm to any one." "Ah!" sighed Mme. de Parme,
greatly relieved. "I must say I never noticed anything myself.
But I know it's often difficult not to be a little spiteful when
one is so full of wit.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "Ah! Now that
is a quality of which she has even less." "Less wit?" asked the
stupefied Princess. "Come now, Oriane," broke in the Duke in a
plaintive tone, casting to right and left of him a glance of
amusement, "you heard the Princess tell you that she was a
superior woman." "But isn't she?" "Superior in chest measurement,
at any rate." "Don't listen to him, Ma'am, he's not sincere;
she's as stupid as a (h'm) goose," came in a loud and rasping
voice from Mme. de Guermantes, who, a great deal more 'old
French' even than the Duke when he was not trying, did often
deliberately seek to be, but in a manner the opposite of the
lace-neckcloth, deliquescent style of her husband and in reality
far more subtle, by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which
had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil. "But she's the
best woman in the world. Besides, I don't really know that one
can call it stupidity when it's carried to such a point as that.
I don't believe I ever met anyone quite like her; she's a case
for a specialist, there's something pathological about her, she's
a sort of 'innocent' or 'cretin' or an 'arrested development,'
like the people you see in melodramas, or in <i>L'Arlésienne</i>.
I always ask myself, when she comes to see me, whether the moment
may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn,
which makes me a little nervous always." The Princess was lost in
admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the
preceding verdict. "She repeated to me&mdash;and so did Mme.
d'Epinay&mdash;what you said about 'Teaser Augustus.' It's
delicious," she put in.</p>
<p>M. de Guermantes explained the joke to me. I wanted to tell
him that his brother, who pretended not to know me, was expecting
me that same evening at eleven o'clock. But I had not asked
Robert whether I might mention this engagement, and as the fact
that M. de Charlus had practically fixed it with me himself
directly contradicted what he had told the Duchess I judged it
more tactful to say nothing. "'Teaser Augustus' was not bad,"
said M. de Guermantes, "but Mme. d'Heudicourt probably did not
tell you a far better thing that Oriane said to her the other day
in reply to an invitation to luncheon." "No, indeed! Do tell me!"
"Now Basin, you keep quiet; in the first place, it was a stupid
remark, and it will make the Princess think me inferior even to
my fool of a cousin. Though I don't know why I should call her my
cousin. She's one of Basin's cousins. Still, I believe she is
related to me in some sort of way." "Oh!" cried the Princesse de
Parme, at the idea that she could possibly think Mme. de
Guermantes stupid, and protesting helplessly that nothing could
ever lower the Duchess from the place she held in her estimation.
"Besides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit;
as what I said to her tends to deny her certain other good
qualities also, it seems to me inopportune to repeat it." "'Deny
her!' 'Inopportune!' How well she expresses herself!" said the
Duke with a pretence of irony, to win admiration for the Duchess.
"Now, then, Basin, you're not to make fun of your wife." "I
should explain to your Royal Highness," went on the Duke, "that
Oriane's cousin may be superior, good, stout, anything you like
to mention, but she is not exactly&mdash;what shall I
say&mdash;lavish." "No, I know, she's terribly close-fisted,"
broke in the Princess. "I should not have ventured to use the
expression, but you have hit on exactly the right word. You can
see it in her house-keeping, and especially in the cooking, which
is excellent, but strictly rationed." "Which leads to some quite
amusing scenes," M. de Bréauté interrupted him. "For instance, my
dear Basin, I was down at Heudicourt one day when you were
expected, Oriane and yourself. They had made the most elaborate
preparations when, during the afternoon, a footman brought in a
telegram to say that you weren't coming." "That doesn't surprise
me!" said the Duchess, who not only was difficult to secure, but
liked people to know as much. "Your cousin read the telegram, was
duly distressed, then immediately, without losing her head,
telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary
expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself, called the
footman back. 'Tell the cook not to put on the chicken!' she
shouted after him. And that evening I heard her asking the
butler: 'Well? What about the beef that was left over yesterday?
Aren't you going to let us have that?'" "All the same, one must
admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best," said the
Duke, who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself
to belong to the old school. "I don't know any house where one
gets better food." "Or less," put in the Duchess. "It is quite
wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel
like myself," went on the Duke, "one keeps one's appetite." "Oh,
if it's to be taken as a cure, it's certainly more hygienic than
sumptuous. Not that it's as good as all that," added Mme. de
Guermantes, who was not at all pleased that the title of 'best
table in Paris' should be awarded to any but her own. "With my
cousin it's just the same as with those costive authors who hatch
out every fifteen years a one-act play or a sonnet. The sort of
thing people call a little masterpiece, trifles that are perfect
gems, in fact the one thing I loathe most in the world. The
cooking at Zénaïde's is not bad, but you would think it more
ordinary if she was less parsimonious. There are some things her
cook does quite well, and others that he spoils. I have had some
thoroughly bad dinners there, as in most houses, only they've
done me less harm there because the stomach is, after all, more
sensitive to quantity than to quality." "Well, to get on with the
story," the Duke concluded "Zénaïde insisted that Oriane should
go to luncheon there, and as my wife is not very fond of going
out anywhere she resisted, wanted to be sure that under the
pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some
great banquet, and tried in vain to find out who else were to be
of the party. 'You must come,' Zénaïde insisted, boasting of all
the good things there would be to eat. 'You are going to have a
<i>purée</i> of chestnuts, I need say no more than that, and
there will be seven little <i>bouchées À la reine</i>.' 'Seven
little <i>bouchées</i>!' cried Oriane, 'that means that we shall
be at least eight!'" There was silence for a few seconds, and
then the Princess having seen the point let her laughter explode
like a peal of thunder. "Ah! 'Then we shall be eight,'&mdash;it's
exquisite. How very well phrased!" she said, having by a supreme
effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by Mme.
d'Epinay, which this time was more appropriate. "Oriane, that was
very charming of the Princess, she said your remark was well
phrased." "But, my dear, you're telling me nothing new. I know
how clever the Princess is," replied Mme. de Guermantes, who
readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a
Royal Personage and in praise of her own wit. "I am very proud
that Ma'am should appreciate my humble phrasings. I don't
remember, though, that I ever did say such a thing, and if I did
it must have been to flatter my cousin, for if she had ordered
seven 'mouthfuls,' the mouths, if I may so express myself, would
have been a round dozen if not more."</p>
<p>"She used to have all M. de Bornier's manuscripts," went on
the Princess, still speaking of Mme. d'Heudicourt, and anxious to
make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for
associating with that lady. "She must have dreamed it, I don't
believe she ever even know him," said the Duchess. "What is
really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence
with people of different nationalities at the same time," put in
the Vicomtesse d'Arpajon who, allied to the principal ducal and
even reigning families of Europe, was always glad that people
should be reminded of the fact. "Surely, Oriane," said M. de
Guermantes, with ulterior purpose, "you can't have forgotten that
dinner-party where you had M. de Bornier sitting next to you!"
"But, Basin," the Duchess interrupted him, "if you mean to inform
me that I knew M. de Bornier, why of course I did, he even called
upon me several times, but I could never bring myself to invite
him to the house because I should always have been obliged to
have it disinfected afterwards with formol. As for the dinner you
mean, I remember it only too well, but it was certainly not at
Zénaïde's, who never set eyes on Bornier in her life, and would
probably think if you spoke to her of the <i>Fille de Roland</i>
that you meant a Bonaparte Princess who was said at one time to
be engaged to the son of the King of Greece; no, it was at the
Austrian Embassy. Dear Hoyos imagined he was giving me a great
treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous
academician. I quite thought I had a squadron of mounted police
sitting beside me. I was obliged to stop my nose as best I could,
all through dinner; until the gruyère came round I didn't dare to
breathe." M. de Guermantes, whose secret object was attained,
made a furtive examination of his guests' faces to judge the
effect of the Duchess's pleasantry. "You were speaking of
correspondence; I must say, I thought Gambetta's admirable," she
went on, to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an
interest in a proletarian and a radical. M. de Bréauté, who fully
appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring, gazed round
him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate, after which he
wiped his monocle.</p>
<p>"Gad, it's infernally dull that <i>Fille de Roland</i>," said
M. de Guermantes, with the satisfaction which he derived from the
sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so,
perhaps also from the <i>suave mari magno</i> feeling one has in
the middle of a good dinner, when one recalls so terrible an
evening in the past. "Still, there were some quite good lines in
it, and a patriotic sentiment."</p>
<p>I let it be understood that I had no admiration for M. de
Bornier. "Indeed! You have some fault to find with him?" the Duke
asked with a note of curiosity, for he always imagined when
anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a
personal resentment, just as to speak well of a woman marked the
beginning of a love-affair. "I see you've got your knife into
him. What did he do to you? You must tell us. Why yes, there must
be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn't run him down.
It's long-winded, the <i>Fille de Roland</i>, but it's quite
strong in parts." "Strong is just the right word for an author
who smelt like that," Mme. de Guermantes broke in sarcastically.
"If this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him, I can
quite understand that he carried away an impression in his
nostrils!" "I must confess, though, to Ma'am," the Duke went on,
addressing the Princesse de Parme, "that quite apart from the
<i>Fille de Roland</i>, in literature and even in music I am
terribly old-fashioned; no old nightingale can be too stale for
my taste. You won't believe me, perhaps, but in the evenings, if
my wife sits down to the piano, I find myself calling for some
old tune by Auber or Boieldieu, or even Beethoven! That's the
sort of thing that appeals to me. As for Wagner, he sends me to
sleep at once." "You are wrong there," said Mme. de Guermantes,
"in spite of his insufferable long-windedness, Wagner was a
genius. <i>Lohengrin</i> is a masterpiece. Even in <i>Tristan</i>
there are some amusing passages scattered about. And the Chorus
of Spinners in the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> is a perfect marvel."
"A'n't I right, Babal," said M. de Guermantes, turning to M. de
Bréauté, "what we like is:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;"><i>Les rendez-vous
de noble compagnie<br>
Se donnent tous en ce charmant séjour</i>.</div>
<p>It's delicious. And <i>Fra Diavolo</i>, and the <i>Magic
Flute</i>, and the <i>Chalet</i>, and the <i>Marriage of
Figaro</i>, and the <i>Diamants de la Couronne</i>&mdash;there's
music for you! It's the same thing in literature. For instance, I
adore Balzac, the <i>Bal de Sceaux</i>, the <i>Mohicans de
Paris</i>." "Oh, my dear, if you are going to begin about Balzac,
we shall never hear the end of it; do wait, keep it for some
evening when Mémé's here. He's even better, he knows it all by
heart." Irritated by his wife's interruption, the Duke held her
for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence. And his
huntsman's eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols.
Meanwhile Mme. d'Arpajon had been exchanging with the Princesse
de Parme, upon tragic and other kinds of poetry, a series of
remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the
following from Mme. d'Arpajon: "Oh, Ma'am is sure to be right; I
quite admit he makes the world seem ugly, because he's unable to
distinguish between ugliness and beauty, or rather because his
insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is
beautiful; I agree with your Highness that in the piece we are
speaking of there are some ridiculous things, quite
unintelligible, errors of taste, that it is difficult to
understand, that it's as much trouble to read as if it was
written in Russian or Chinese, for of course it's anything in the
world but French, still when one has taken the trouble, how
richly one is rewarded, it's so full of imagination!" Of this
little lecture I had missed the opening sentences. I gathered in
the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing
between beauty and ugliness was Victor Hugo, but furthermore that
the poem which was as difficult to understand as Chinese or
Russian was</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;"><i>Lorsque l'enfant
paraît, le cercle de famille<br>
Applaudit À grands cris</i>.</div>
<p>a piece dating from the poet's earliest period, and perhaps
even nearer to Mme. Deshoulières than to the Victor Hugo of the
<i>Légende des Siècles</i>. Far from condemning Mme. d'Arpajon as
absurd, I saw her (the only one, at that table so matter-of-fact,
so nondescript, at which I had sat down with such keen
disappointment), I saw her in my mind's eye crowned with that
lace cap, with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either
side, which was worn by Mme. de Rémusat, Mme. de Broglie, Mme. de
Saint-Aularie, all those distinguished women who in their
fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly
passages from Sophocles, Schiller and the <i>Imitation</i>, but
in whom the earliest poetry of the Romantics induced the alarm
and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest
verses of Stéphane Mallarmé. "Mme. d'Arpajon is very fond of
poetry," said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess, impressed by
the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. "No; she
knows absolutely nothing about it," replied Mme. de Guermantes in
an undertone, taking advantage of the fact that Mme. d'Arpajon,
who was dealing with an objection raised by General de
Beautreillis, was too much intent upon what she herself was
saying to hear what was being murmured by the Duchess. "She has
become literary since she's been forsaken. I can tell your
Highness that it is I who have to bear the whole burden of it
because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever
Basin hasn't been to see her, which is practically every day. And
yet it isn't my fault, after all, if she bores him, and I can't
force him to go to her, although I would rather he were a little
more faithful to her, because then I shouldn't see quite so much
of her myself. But she drives him crazy, and there's nothing
extraordinary in that. She isn't a bad sort, but she's boring to
a degree you can't imagine. And all this because Basin took it
into his head for a year or so to play me false with her. And to
have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little
street-walker and goes about with a long face if I don't request
the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an
hour and come to tea with me! Oh! Life really is too tedious!"
the Duchess languorously concluded. Mme. d'Arpajon bored M. de
Guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love
with another, whom I discovered to be the Marquise de
Surgis-le-Duc. At this moment the footman who had been deprived
of his holiday was waiting at table. And it struck me that, still
disconsolate, he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty, for
I noticed that, in handing the dish to M. de Châtellerault, he
performed his task so awkwardly that the Duke's elbow came in
contact several times with his own. The young Duke was not in the
least annoyed with the blushing footman, but looked up at him
rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes. This good humour
seemed to me on the guest's part to betoken a kindness of heart.
But the persistence of his smile led me to think that, aware of
the servant's discomfiture, what he felt was perhaps really a
malicious joy. "But, my dear, you know you're not revealing any
new discovery when you tell us about Victor Hugo," went on the
Duchess, this time addressing Mme. d'Arpajon whom she had just
seen turn away from the General with a troubled air. "You mustn't
expect to launch that young genius. Everybody knows that he has
talent. What is utterly detestable is the Victor Hugo of the last
stage, the <i>Légende des Siècles</i>, I forget all their names.
But in the <i>Feuilles d'Automne</i>, the <i>Chants du
Crépuscule</i>, there's a great deal that's the work of a poet, a
true poet! Even in the <i>Contemplations</i>," went on the
Duchess, whom none of her listeners dared to contradict, and with
good reason, "there are still some quite pretty things. But I
confess that I prefer not to venture farther than the
<i>Crepuscule</i>! And then in the finer poems of Victor Hugo,
and there really are some, one frequently comes across an idea,
even a profound idea." And with the right shade of sentiment,
bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her
intonation, planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice,
and fixing straight in front of her a charming, dreamy gaze, the
Duchess said slowly: "Take this:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:10%;"><i>La douleur est un
fruit, Dieu ne le fait pas croître<br>
Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter</i>.</div>
<p>Or, better still:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:10%;"><i>Les morts durent
bien peu.<br>
Hélas, dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussière<br>
Moins vite qu'en nos c&oelig;urs</i>!"</div>
<p>And, while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a
graceful undulation her sorrowing lips, the Duchess fastened on
Mme. d'Arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming, clear blue
eyes. I was beginning to know them, as well as her voice, with
its heavy drawl, its harsh savour. In those eyes and in that
voice, I recognised much of the life of nature round Combray.
Certainly, in the affectation with which that voice brought into
prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than
one element: the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the
Guermantes family, which had for long remained more localised,
more hardy, wilder, more provoking than the rest; and also the
usage of really distinguished people, and of witty people who
know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech, and the
usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants
than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the
regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more
easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the
same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she
detested, and who, less intelligent than herself and almost
plebeianly married, if one may coin this adverb to speak of
unions with obscure noblemen, entrenched on their provincial
estates, or, in Paris, in a Faubourg Saint-Germain of no
brilliance, possessed this voice also but had bridled it,
corrected it, softened it so far as lay in their power, just as
it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality
and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most
approved models. But Oriane was so much more intelligent, so much
richer, above all, so much more in fashion than her sisters, she
had so effectively, when Princesse des Laumes, behaved just as
she pleased in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she had
realised that this discordant voice was an attraction, and had
made of it, in the social order, with the courage of originality
rewarded by success, what in the theatrical order a Réjane, a
Jeanne Granier (which implies no comparison, naturally, between
the respective merits and talents of those two actresses) had
made of theirs, something admirable and distinctive which
possibly certain Réjane and Granier sisters, whom no one has ever
known, strove to conceal as a defect.</p>
<p>To all these reasons for displaying her local originality, the
favourite writers of Mme. de Guermantes&mdash;Mérimée, Meilhac
and Halévy&mdash;had brought in addition, with the respect for
what was natural, a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained
to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant
landscapes before my eyes. Besides, the Duchess was fully
capable, adding to these influences an artistic research of her
own, of having chosen for the majority of her words the
pronunciation that seemed to her most 'He de France,' most
'Champenoise,' since, if not quite to the same extent as her
sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely used anything but the pure
vocabulary that might have been employed by an old French writer.
And when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern
speech, it was, albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer
ideas, a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de
Guermantes&mdash;almost the same feeling, if one was alone with
her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of
words, as one has on hearing an old song. Then, as I looked at,
as I listened to Mme. de Guermantes, I could see, a prisoner in
the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes, a sky of the He de
France or of Champagne spread itself, grey-blue, oblique, with
the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of Saint-Loup.</p>
<p>Thus, by these several formations, Mme. de Guermantes
expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic France, then,
from a far later source, the manner in which the Duchesse de
Broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with Victor Hugo under
the July Monarchy, and, finally, a keen taste for the literature
that sprang from Mérimée and Meilhac. The first of these
formations attracted me more than the second, did more to console
me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, so different from what I had imagined it
to be; but even the second I preferred to the last. For, so long
as Mme. de Guermantes was being, almost spontaneously, a
Guermantes and nothing more, her Pailleronism, her taste for the
younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was
the opposite of my own, she was productive, to my mind, of
literature when she talked to me of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,
and never seemed to me so stupidly Faubourg Saint-Germain as when
she was talking literature.</p>
<p>Moved by this last quotation, Mme. d'Arpajon exclaimed: "'Ces
reliques du c&oelig;ur ont aussi leur poussière!'&mdash;Sir, you
must write that down for me on my fan," she said to M. de
Guermantes. "Poor woman, I feel sorry for her!" said the
Princesse de Parme to Mme. de Guermantes. "No, really, Ma'am, you
must not be soft-hearted, she has only got what she deserves."
"But&mdash;you'll forgive me for saying this to you&mdash;she
does really love him all the same!" "Oh, not at all; she isn't
capable of it; she thinks she loves him just as she thought just
now she was quoting Victor Hugo, when she repeated a line from
Musset. Listen," the Duchess went on in a tone of melancholy,
"nobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment.
But let me give you an instance. Only yesterday, she made a
terrible scene with Basin. Your Highness thinks perhaps that it
was because he's in love with other women, because he no longer
loves her; not in the least, it was because he won't put her sons
down for the Jockey. Does Ma'am call that the behaviour of a
woman in love? No; I will go farther;" Mme. de Guermantes added
with precision, "she is a person of singular insensibility."
Meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that M.
de Guermantes had listened to his wife talking about Victor Hugo
'point-blank' and quoting his poetry. The Duchess might
frequently annoy him; at moments like this he was proud of her.
"Oriane is really extraordinary. She can talk about anything, she
has read everything. She could not possibly have guessed that the
conversation this evening would turn on Victor Hugo. Whatever
subject you take up, she is ready for you, she can hold her own
with the most learned scholars. This young man must be quite
captivated."</p>
<p>"Do let us change the conversation," Mme. de Guermantes went
on, "because she's dreadfully susceptible. You will think me
quite old-fashioned," she began, turning to me. "I know that
nowadays it's considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry,
poetry with some thought in it." "Old-fashioned?" asked the
Princesse de Parme, quivering with the slight thrill sent through
her by this new wave which she had not expected, albeit she knew
that the conversation of the Duchesse de Guermantes always held
in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks, that
breath-catching panic, that wholesome exhaustion after which her
thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a
footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to 'restore her
circulation.'</p>
<p>"For my part, no, Oriane," said Mme. de Brissac, "I don't in
the least object to Victor Hugo's having ideas, quite the
contrary, but I do object to his seeking for them in sheer
monstrosities. After all, it was he who accustomed us to ugliness
in literature. There are quite enough ugly things already in real
life. Why can't we be allowed at least to forget it while we are
reading. A distressing spectacle, from which we should turn away
in real life, that is what attracts Victor Hugo."</p>
<p>"Victor Hugo is not as realistic as Zola though, surely?"
asked the Princesse de Parme. The name of Zola did not stir a
muscle on the face of M. de Beautreillis. The General's
anti-Dreyfusism was too deep-rooted for him to seek to give
expression to it. And his good-natured silence when anyone
broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the
same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to
your religious duties, a financier when he takes care not to
recommend your investing in the companies which he himself
controls, a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness
and does not hit you in the jaw. "I know you're related to
Admiral Jurien de la Gravière," was murmured to me with an air of
connivance by Mme. de Varambon, the lady in waiting to the
Princesse de Parme, an excellent but limited woman, procured for
the Princess in the past by the Duke's mother. She had not
previously uttered a word to me, and I could never afterwards,
despite the admonitions of the Princess and my own protestations,
get out of her mind the idea that I was in some way connected
with the Academician Admiral, who was a complete stranger to me.
The obstinate persistence of the Princesse de Parme's lady in
waiting in seeing in me a nephew of Admiral Jurien de la Gravière
was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness. But the
mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other
mistakes, less serious, more elaborate, unconscious or
deliberate, which accompany one's name on the label which society
writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the
Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as
the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin, Mme. de
Chaussegros. "She is a charming person, she's so fond of you." I
scrupulously, though quite vainly, insisted on the fact that
there must be some mistake, as I did not know Mme. de
Chaussegros. "Then it's her sister you know; it comes to the same
thing. She met you in Scotland." I had never been in Scotland,
and took the futile precaution, in my honesty, of letting my
informant know this. It was Mme. de Chaussegros herself who had
said that she knew me, and no doubt sincerely believed it, as a
result of some initial confusion, for from that time onwards she
never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me. And
as, after all, the world in which I moved was precisely that in
which Mme. de Chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor
reason. To say that I was intimate with the Chaussegros was,
literally, a mistake, but from the social point of view was to
state an equivalent of my position, if one can speak of the
social position of so young a man as I then was. It therefore
mattered not in the least that this friend of the Guermantes
should tell me only things that were false about myself, he
neither lowered nor exalted me (from the worldly point of view)
in the idea which he continued to hold of me. And when all is
said, for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium
of living always in the same character is removed for a moment,
as if we were to go on the boards, when another person forms a
false idea of us, imagines that we are friends with a lady whom
we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a
delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made.
Errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have
not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed,
and continued for the rest of her life to be committed, in spite
of my denials, by the imbecile lady in waiting to Mme. de Parme,
rooted for all time in the belief that I was related to the
tiresome Admiral Jurien de la Gravière. "She is not very strong
in her head," the Duke confided to me, "and besides, she ought
not to indulge in too many libations. I fancy, she's slightly
under the influence of Bacchus." As a matter of fact Mme. de
Varambon had drunk nothing but water, but the Duke liked to find
scope for his favourite figures of speech. "But Zola is not a
realist, Ma'am, he's a poet!" said Mme. de Guermantes, drawing
inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent
years and adapting them to her own personal genius. Agreeably
buffeted hitherto, in the course of this bath of wit, a bath
stirred for herself, which she was taking this evening and which,
she considered, must be particularly good for her health, letting
herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and
broke one after another, before this, the most enormous of them
all, the Princesse de Parme jumped for fear of being knocked
over. And it was in a choking voice, as though she were quite out
of breath, that she now gasped: "Zola a poet!" "Why, yes,"
answered the Duchess with a laugh, entranced by this display of
suffocation. "Your Highness must have remarked how he magnifies
everything he touches. You will tell me that he touches just
what&mdash;perish the thought! But he makes it into something
colossal. His is the epic dungheap. He is the Homer of the
sewers! He has not enough capitals to print Cambronne's word."
Despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel,
the Princess was enchanted; never had she felt better. She would
not have exchanged for an invitation to Schönbrunn, albeit that
was the one thing that really flattered her, these divine
dinner-parties at Mme. de Guermantes's, made invigorating by so
liberal a dose of attic salt. "He writes it with a big C," cried
Mme. d'Arpajon. "Surely with a big M, I think, my dear," replied
Mme. de Guermantes, exchanging first with her husband a merry
glance which implied: "Did you ever hear such an idiot?" "Wait a
minute, now." Mme. de Guermantes turned to me, fixing on me a
tender, smiling gaze, because, as an accomplished hostess, she
was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who
interested me specially, to give me, if I required it, an
opportunity for exhibiting mine. "Wait," she urged me, gently
waving her feather fan, so conscious was she at this moment that
she was performing in full the duties of hospitality, and, that
she might be found wanting in none of them, making a sign also to
the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and
<i>mousseline</i> sauce: "wait, now, I do believe that Zola has
actually written an essay on Elstir, the painter whose things you
were looking at just now&mdash;the only ones of his, really, that
I care for," she concluded. As a matter of fact sh hated Elstir's
work, but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own
house. I asked M. de Guermantes if he knew the name of the
gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd
and whom I recognised as the same person whose portrait the
Guermantes also had and had hung beside the other, both dating
more or less from the same early period in which Elstir's
personality was not yet completely established and he derived a
certain inspiration from Manet. "Good Lord, yes," he replied, "I
know it's a fellow who is quite well-known and no fool either in
his own line, but I have no head for names. I have it on the tip
of my tongue, Monsieur.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Monsieur.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. oh, well, it
doesn't matter, I can't remember it. Swann would be able to tell
you, it was he who made Mme. de Guermantes buy all that stuff;
she is always too good-natured, afraid of hurting people's
feelings if she refuses to do things; between ourselves, I
believe he's landed us with a lot of rubbish. What I can tell you
is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of Maecenas to M.
Elstir, he started him and has often helped him out of tight
places by ordering pictures from him. As a compliment to this
man&mdash;if you can call that sort of thing a
compliment&mdash;he has painted him standing about among that
crowd, where with his Sunday-go-to-meeting look he creates a
distinctly odd effect. He may be a big gun in his own way but he
is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top
hat. With that thing on his head, among all those bare-headed
girls, he looks like a little country lawyer on the
razzle-dazzle. But tell me, you seem quite gone on his pictures.
If I had only known, I should have got up the subject properly.
Not that there's any need to rack one's brains over the meaning
of M. Elstir's work, as one would for Ingres's <i>Source</i> or
the <i>Princes in the Tower</i> by Paul Delaroche. What one
appreciates in his work is that it's shrewdly observed, amusing,
Parisian, and then one passes on to the next thing. One doesn't
need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing. I know of
course that they're merely sketches, still, I don't feel myself
that he puts enough work into them. Swann was determined that we
should buy a <i>Bundle of Asparagus</i>. In fact it was in the
house for several days. There was nothing else in the picture, a
bundle of asparagus exactly like what you're eating now. But I
must say I declined to swallow M. Elstir's asparagus. He asked
three hundred francs for them. Three hundred francs for a bundle
of asparagus. A louis, that's as much as they're worth, even if
they are out of season. I thought it a bit stiff. When he puts
real people into his pictures as well, there's something rather
caddish, something detrimental about him which does not appeal to
me. I am surprised to see a delicate mind, a superior brain like
yours admire that sort of thing." "I don't know why you should
say that, Basin," interrupted the Duchess, who did not like to
hear people run down anything that her rooms contained. "I am by
no means prepared to admit that there's nothing distinguished in
Elstir's pictures. You have to take it or leave it. But it's not
always lacking in talent. And you must admit that the ones I
bought are singularly beautiful." "Well, Oriane, in that style of
thing I'd a thousand times rather have the little study by M.
Vibert we saw at the water-colour exhibition. There's nothing
much in it, if you like, you could take it in the palm of your
hand, but you can see the man's clever through and through: that
unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek
prelate who is making his little dog do tricks, it's a perfect
little poem of subtlety, and in fact goes really deep." "I
believe you know M. Elstir," the Duchess went on to me, "as a
man, he's quite pleasant." "He is intelligent," said the Duke;
"one is surprised, when one talks to him, that his painting
should be so vulgar." "He is more than intelligent, he is really
quite clever," said the Duchess in the confidently critical tone
of a person who knew what she was talking about. "Didn't he once
start a portrait of you, Oriane?" asked the Princesse de Parme.
"Yes, in shrimp pink," replied Mme. de Guermantes, "but that's
not going to hand his name down to posterity. It's a ghastly
thing; Basin wanted to have it destroyed." This last statement
was one which Mme. de Guermantes often made. But at other times
her appreciation of the picture was different: "I do not care for
his painting, but he did once do a good portrait of me." The
former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who
spoke to the Duchess of her portrait, the other to those who did
not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of
its existence. The former was inspired in her by coquetry, the
latter by vanity. "Make a portrait of you look ghastly! Why, then
it can't be a portrait, it's a falsehood; I don't know one end of
a brush from the other, but I'm sure if I were to paint you,
merely putting you down as I see you, I should produce a
masterpiece," said the Princesse de Parme ingenuously. "He sees
me probably as I see myself, without any allurements," said the
Duchesse de Guermantes, with the look, melancholy, modest and
coaxing, which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear
different from what Elstir had portrayed. "That portrait ought to
appeal to Mme. de Gallardon," said the Duke. "Because she knows
nothing about pictures?" asked the Princesse de Parme, who knew
that Mme. de Guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin.
"But she's a very good woman, isn't she?" The Duke assumed an air
of profound astonishment. "Why, Basin, don't you see the Princess
is making fun of you?" (The Princess had never dreamed of doing
such a thing.) "She knows as well as you do that Gallardonette is
an old poison," went on Mme. de Guermantes, whose vocabulary,
limited as a rule to all these old expressions, was as savoury as
those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious
books of Pampille, but which have in real life become so rare,
dishes where the jellies, the butter, the gravy, the quails are
all genuine, permit of no alloy, where even the salt is brought
specially from the salt-marshes of Brittany; from her accent, her
choice of words, one felt that the basis of the Duchess's
conversation came directly from Guermantes. In this way the
Duchess differed profoundly from her nephew Saint-Loup, the prey
of so many new ideas and expressions; it is difficult, when one's
mind is troubled by the ideas of Kant and the longings of
Baudelaire, to write the exquisite French of Henri IV, which
meant that the very purity of the Duchess's language was a sign
of limitation, and that, in her, both her intelligence and her
sensibility had remained proof against all innovation. Here
again, Mme. de Guermantes's mind attracted me just because of
what it excluded (which was exactly the content of my own
thoughts) and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion, it
had been able to preserve, that seductive vigour of the supple
bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or
nervous trouble has deformed. Her mind, of a formation so
anterior to my own, was for me the equivalent of what had been
offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band
along the seashore Mme. de Guermantes offered me, domesticated
and held in subjection by her natural courtesy, by the respect
due to another person's intellectual worth, all the energy and
charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round
Combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle,
tortured cats, gouged out the eyes of rabbits, and; albeit she
had remained a pillar of virtue, might equally well have been, a
good few years ago now, the most brilliant mistress of the Prince
de Sagan. Only she was incapable of realising what I had sought
for in her, the charm of her historic name, and the tiny quantity
of it that I had found in her, a rustic survival from Guermantes.
Were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could
not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage, instead of
being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she
believed herself to be, should be diverted to some other woman of
equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm? A
misunderstanding so entirely natural, and one that will always
exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the
world, one however that profoundly disturbs him, so long as he
has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties
and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments
which he is destined to find in people, as in the theatre, in his
travels and indeed in love. M. de Guermantes having declared
(following upon Elstir's asparagus and those that were brought
round after the <i>financière</i> chicken) that green asparagus
grown in the open air, which, as has been so quaintly said by the
charming writer who signs himself E. de Clermont-Tonnerre, "have
not the impressive rigidity of their sisters," ought to be eaten
with eggs: "One man's meat is another man's poison, as they say,"
replied M. de Bréauté. "In the province of Canton, in China, the
greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of
ortolan's eggs completely rotten." M. de Bréauté, the author of
an essay on the Mormons which had appeared in the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, moved in none but the most aristocratic circles,
but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for
intellect, with the result that from his presence, were it at all
regular, in a woman's house one could tell that she had a
'salon.' He pretended to a loathing of society, and assured each
of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and
beauty that he came to see her. They all believed him. Whenever,
with death in his heart, he resigned himself to attending a big
party at the Princesse de Parme's, he summoned them all to
accompany him, to keep up his courage, and thus appeared only to
be moving in the midst of an intimate group. So that his
reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success,
applying certain maxims of the Guermantes spirit, he would set
out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the
height of the dancing season, and when a woman who was a snob,
and consequently still without any definite position, began to go
everywhere, he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to
know her, to allow himself to be introduced to her. His hatred of
snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness, but made the
simpletons (in other words, everyone) believe that he was immune
from snobbishness. "Babal always knows everything," exclaimed the
Duchesse de Guermantes. "I think it must be charming, a country
where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you
with really rotten eggs, eggs of the year of the comet. I can see
myself dipping my bread and butter in them. I must say, you get
the same thing at aunt Madeleine's" (Mme. de Villeparisis's)
"where everything's served in a state of putrefaction, eggs
included." Then, as Mme. d'Arpajon protested, "But my dear Phili,
you know it as well as I do. You can see the chicken in the egg.
What I can't understand is how they manage not to fall out. It's
not an omelette you get there, it's a poultry-yard. You were so
wise not to come to dinner there yesterday, there was a brill
cooked in carbolic! I assure you, it wasn't a dinner-table, it
was far more like an operating-table. Really, Norpois carries
loyalty to the pitch of heroism. He actually asked for more!" "I
believe I saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack
on M. Bloch" (M. de Guermantes, perhaps to give to an Israelite
name a more foreign sound, pronounced the 'ch' in Bloch not like
a 'k' but as in the German 'hoch') "when he said about some poit"
(poet) "or other that he was sublime. Châtellerault did his best
to break M. Bloch's shins, the fellow didn't understand in the
least and thought my nephew's kick was aimed at a young woman
sitting opposite him." (At this point, M. de Guermantes coloured
slightly.) "He did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by
his 'sublimes' chucked about all over the place like that. In
short, aunt Madeleine, who doesn't keep her tongue in her pocket,
turned on him with: 'Indeed, Sir, and what epithet do you keep
for M. de Bossuet?'" (M. de Guermantes thought that, when one
mentioned a famous name, the use of 'Monsieur' and a particle was
eminently 'old school.') "That put him in his place, all right."
"And what answer did this M. Bloch make?" came in a careless tone
from Mme. de Guermantes, who, running short for the moment of
original ideas, felt that she must copy her husband's teutonic
pronunciation. "Ah! I can assure you, M. Bloch did not wait for
any more, he's still running." "Yes, I remember quite well seeing
you there that evening," said Mme. de Guermantes with emphasis as
though, coming from her, there must be something in this
reminiscence highly flattering to myself. "It is always so
interesting at my aunt's. At the last party she gave, which was,
of course, when I met you, I meant to ask you whether that old
gentleman who went past where we were, sitting wasn't François
Coppée. You must know who everyone is," she went on, sincerely
envious of my relations with poets and poetry, and also out of
'consideration' for myself, the wish to establish in a better
position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well
versed in literature. I assured the Duchess that I had not
observed any celebrities at Mme. de Villeparisis's party. "What!"
she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect
for men of letters and her contempt for society were more
superficial than she said, perhaps even than she thought, "What!
There were no famous authors there! You astonish me! Why, I saw
all sorts of quite impossible people!" I remembered the evening
in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that
had occurred at the party. Mme. de Villeparisis had introduced
Bloch to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, but my friend had not
caught the name and, thinking he was talking to an old English
lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to
the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty, when Mme. de
Villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered, quite
distinctly this time: "The Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild."
Thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through
Bloch's arteries so many ideas of millions and of social
importance, which it would have been more prudent to subdivide
and separate, that he had undergone, so to speak, a momentary
failure of heart and brain alike, and cried aloud in the dear old
lady's presence: "If I'd only known!" an exclamation the
silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week
afterwards. His remark was of no great interest, but I remembered
it as a proof that sometimes in this life, under the stress of an
exceptional emotion, people do say what is in their minds. "I
fancy Mme. de Villeparisis is not
absolutely.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. moral," said the Princesse
de Parme, who knew that the best people did not visit the
Duchess's aunt, and, from what the Duchess herself had just been
saying, that one might speak freely about her. But, Mme. de
Guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism, she hastened
to add: "Though, of course, intellect carried to that degree
excuses everything." "But you take the same view of my aunt that
everyone else does," replied the Duchess, "which is, really,
quite mistaken. It's just what Mémé was saying to me only
yesterday." She blushed; a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her
eyes. I formed the supposition that M. de Charlus had asked her
to cancel my invitation, as he had sent Robert to ask me not to
go to her house. I had the impression that the
blush&mdash;equally incomprehensible to me&mdash;which had tinged
the Duke's cheek when he made some reference to his brother could
not be attributed to the same cause. "My poor aunt&mdash;she will
always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school, of
sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions. And really there's no
more middle-class, serious, commonplace mind in Paris. She will
go down as a patron of the arts, which means to say that she was
once the mistress of a great painter, though he was never able to
make her understand what a picture was; and as for her private
life, so far from being a depraved woman, she was so much made
for marriage, so conjugal from her cradle that, not having
succeeded in keeping a husband, who incidentally was a cad, she
has never had a love-affair which she hasn't taken just as
seriously as if it were holy matrimony, with the same
susceptibilities, the same quarrels, the same fidelity. By which
token, those relations are often the most sincere; you'll find,
in fact, more inconsolable lovers than husbands." "Yet, Oriane,
if you take the case of your brother-in-law Palamède you were
speaking about just now; no mistress in the world could ever
dream of being mourned as that poor Mme. de Charlus has been."
"Ah!" replied the Duchess, "Your Highness must permit me to be
not altogether of her opinion. People don't all like to be
mourned in the same way, each of us has his preferences." "Still,
he did make a regular cult of her after her death. It is true
that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have
done for the living." "For one thing," retorted Mme. de
Guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose, "we
go to their funerals, which we never do for the living!" M. de
Guermantes gave a sly glance at M. de Bréauté as though to
provoke him into laughter at the Duchess's wit. "At the same time
I frankly admit," went on Mme. de Guermantes, "that the manner in
which I should like to be mourned by a man I loved would not be
that adopted by my brother-in-law." The Duke's face darkened. He
did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments, especially
about M. de Charlus. "You are very particular. His grief set an
example to everyone," he reproved her stiffly. But the Duchess
had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which
animal tamers shew, or people who live with a madman and are not
afraid of making him angry. "Oh, very well, just as you
like&mdash;he does set an example, I never said he didn't, he
goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has
had to luncheon, he misses her enormously, but&mdash;as he'd
mourn for a cousin, a grandmother, a sister. It is not the grief
of a husband. It is true that they were a pair of saints, which
makes it all rather exceptional." M. de Guermantes, infuriated by
his wife's chatter, fixed on her with a terrible immobility a
pair of eyes already loaded. "I don't wish to say anything
against poor Mémé, who, by the way, could not come this evening,"
went on the Duchess, "I quite admit there's no one like him, he's
delightful; he has a delicacy, a warmth of heart that you don't
as a rule find in men. He has a woman's heart, Mémé has!" "What
you say is absurd," M. de Guermantes broke in sharply. "There's
nothing effeminate about Mémé, I know nobody so manly as he is."
"But I am not suggesting that he's the least bit in the world
effeminate. Do at least take the trouble to understand what I
say," retorted the Duchess. "He's always like that the moment
anyone mentions his brother," she added, turning to the Princesse
de Parme. "It's very charming, it's a pleasure to hear him.
There's nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each
other," replied the Princess, as many a humbler person might have
replied, for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth
and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is
thoroughly plebeian.</p>
<p>"As we're discussing your family, Oriane," said the Princess,
"I saw your nephew Saint-Loup yesterday; I believe he wants to
ask you to do something for him." The Duc de Guermantes bent his
Olympian brow. When he did not himself care to do a service, he
preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it,
knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that
the people to whom the Duchess would be obliged to apply would
put this concession down to the common account of the household,
just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband
alone. "Why didn't he tell me about it himself?" said the
Duchess. "He was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours, and
heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself. He
would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense,
like many people we know, to be content with being a fool. It's
his veneer of knowledge that's so terrible. He wants to preserve
an open mind&mdash;open to all the things he doesn't understand.
He talks to you about Morocco. It's appalling."</p>
<p>"He can't go back there, because of Rachel," said the Prince
de Foix "Surely, now that they've broken it off," interrupted M.
de Bréauté. "So far from breaking it off, I found her a couple of
days ago in Robert's rooms, they didn't look at all like people
who'd quarrelled, I can assure you," replied the Prince de Foix,
who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage
Robert's chances of marrying, and might for that matter have been
misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that
was practically at an end.</p>
<p>"That Rachel was speaking to me about you, I see her like that
in the mornings, on the way to the Champs-Elysées; she's a kind
of head-in-air, as you say, what you call 'unlaced,' a sort of
'Dame aux Camélias,' only figuratively speaking, of course." This
speech was addressed to me by Prince Von, who liked always to
appear conversant with French literature and Parisian
catchwords.</p>
<p>"Why, that's just what it was&mdash;Morocco!" exclaimed the
Princess, flinging herself into this opening. "What on earth can
he want in Morocco?" asked M. de Guermantes sternly; "Oriane can
do absolutely nothing for him there, as he knows perfectly well."
"He thinks he invented strategy," Mme. de Guermantes pursued the
theme, "and then he uses impossible words for the most trivial
things, which doesn't prevent him from making blots all over his
letters. The other day he announced that he'd been given some
sublime potatoes, and that he'd taken a <i>sublime</i> stage
box." "He speaks Latin," the Duke went one better. "What! Latin?"
the Princesse gasped. "'Pon my soul he does! Ma'am can ask Oriane
if I'm not telling the truth." "Why, of course, Ma'am; the other
day he said to us straight out, without stopping to think: 'I
know of no more touching example of <i>sic transit gloria
mundi</i>.' I can repeat the phrase now to your Highness because,
after endless inquiries and by appealing to <i>linguists</i>, we
succeeded in reconstructing it, but Robert flung it out without
pausing for breath, one could hardly make out that there was
Latin in it, he was just like a character in the <i>Malade
Imaginaire</i>. And all this referred simply to the death of the
Empress of Austria!" "Poor woman!" cried the Princess, "what a
delicious creature she was." "Yes," replied the Duchess, "a
trifle mad, a trifle headstrong, but she was a thoroughly good
woman, a nice, kind-hearted lunatic; the only thing I could never
make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth
made to fit her; they always came loose half-way through a
sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she'd have
swallowed them." "That Rachel was speaking to me about you, she
told me that young Saint-Loup worshipped you, that he was fonder
of you than he was of her," said Prince Von to me, devouring his
food like an ogre as he spoke, his face scarlet, his teeth bared
by his perpetual grin. "But in that case she must be jealous of
me and hate me," said I. "Not at all, she told me all sorts of
nice things about you. The Prince de Foix's mistress would
perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her. You don't
understand? Come home with me, and I'll explain it all to you."
"I'm afraid I can't, I'm going on to M. de Charlus at eleven."
"Why, he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him
this evening, but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven.
But if you must go to him, at least come with me as far as the
Théâtre Français, you will be in the periphery," said the Prince,
who thought doubtless that this last word meant 'proximity' or
possibly 'centre.'</p>
<p>But the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face
frightened me and I declined, saying that a friend was coming to
call for me. This reply seemed to me in no way offensive. The
Prince, however, apparently formed a different impression of it
for he did not say another word to me.</p>
<p>"I really must go and see the Queen of Naples; what a grief it
must be to her," said (or at least appeared to me to have said)
the Princesse de Parme. For her words had come to me only
indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to
me, albeit in an undertone, by Prince Von, who had doubtless been
afraid, if he spoke louder, of being overheard by the Prince de
Foix. "Oh, dear, no!" replied the Duchess, "I don't believe it
has been any grief at all." "None at all! You do always fly to
extremes so, Oriane," said M. de Guermantes, resuming his part of
the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling
higher its crest of foam. "Basin knows even better than I that
I'm telling the truth," replied the Duchess, "but he thinks he's
obliged to look severe because you are present, Ma'am, and he's
afraid of my shocking you." "Oh, please, no, I beg of you," cried
the Princesse de Parme, dreading the slightest alteration on her
account of these delicious Fridays at the Duchesse de
Guermantes's, this forbidden fruit which the Queen of Sweden
herself had not yet acquired the right to taste. "Why, it was
Basin himself that she told, when he said to her with a duly
sorrowful expression: 'But the Queen is in mourning; for whom,
pray, is it a great grief to your Majesty?'&mdash;'No, it's not a
deep mourning, it's a light mourning, quite a light mourning,
it's my sister.' The truth is, she's delighted about it, as Basin
knows perfectly well, she invited us to a party that very
evening, and gave me two pearls. I wish she could lose a sister
every day! So far from weeping for her sister's death, she was in
fits of laughter over it. She probably says to herself, like
Robert, '<i>sic transit</i>&mdash;&mdash;' I forget how it goes
on," she added modestly, knowing how it went on perfectly
well.</p>
<p>In saying all this Mme. de Guermantes was only being witty,
and with complete insincerity, for the Queen of Naples, like the
Duchesse d'Alençon, also doomed to a tragic fate, had the warmest
heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk.
Mme. de Guermantes knew those noble Bavarian sisters, her
cousins, too well not to be aware of this. "He would like not to
go back to Morocco," said the Princesse de Parme, alighting
hurriedly again upon the perch of Robert's name which had been
held out to her, quite unintentionally, by Mme. de Guermantes. "I
believe you know General de Monserfeuil." "Very slightly,"
replied the Duchess, who was an intimate friend of the officer in
question. The Princess explained what it was that Saint-Loup
wanted. "Good gracious, yes, if I see him&mdash;it is possible
that I may meet him," the Duchess replied, so as not to appear to
be refusing, the occasions of her meeting General de Monserfeuil
seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a
question of her asking him for anything. This uncertainty did
not, however, satisfy the Duke, who interrupted his wife: "You
know perfectly well you won't seeing him, Oriane, and besides you
have already asked him for two thing which he hasn't done. My
wife has a passion for doing good turns to people," he went on,
growing more and more furious, in order to force the Princess to
withdraw her request, without there being any question made of
his wife's good nature and so that Mme. de Parme should throw the
blame back upon his own character, which was essentially
obstructive. "Robert could get anything he wanted out of
Monserfeuil. Only, as he happens not to know himself what he
wants, he gets us to ask for it because he knows there's no
better way of making the whole thing fall through. Oriane has
asked too many favours of Monserfeuil. A request from her now
would be a reason for him to refuse." "Oh, in that case, it would
be better if the Duchess did nothing," said Mme. de Parme.
"Obviously!" the Duke closed the discussion. "Poor General, he's
been defeated again at the elections," said the Princess, so as
to turn the conversation from Robert. "Oh, it's nothing serious,
it's only the seventh time," said the Duke, who, having been
obliged himself to retire from politics, quite enjoyed hearing of
other people's failures at the polls. "He has consoled himself by
giving his wife another baby." "What! Is that poor Mme. de
Monserfeuil in an interesting condition again?" cried the
Princess. "Why, of course," replied the Duke, "that's the one
division where the poor General has never failed to get in."</p>
<p>In the period that followed I was continually to be invited,
were it with a small party only, to these repasts at which I had
at one time imagined the guests as seated like the Apostles in
the Sainte-Chapelle. They did assemble there indeed, like the
early Christians, not to partake merely of a material
nourishment, which incidentally was exquisite, but in a sort of
social Eucharist; so that in the course of a few dinner-parties I
assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts,
friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent
patronage so marked (as a person for whom they had always had a
sort of parental affection) that there was not one among them who
would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the Duke
and Duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on
his list, and at the same time, while I sipped one of those
Yquems which lay concealed in the Guermantes cellars, I tasted
ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which
the Duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence.
However, for one who had already set his knees more than once
beneath the mystic board, the consumption of the latter was not
indispensable. Old friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes came in
to see them after dinner, 'with the tooth-picks,' as Mme. Swann
would have said, without being expected, and took in winter a cup
of <i>tilleul</i> in the lighted warmth of the great
drawing-room, in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of
the little rectangular strip of garden outside. There was no
record of anything else, among the Guermantes, in these evenings
in the garden, but orangeade. It had a sort of ritual meaning. To
have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying
the tradition, just as a big at-home in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain ceases to be an at-home if there is a play also, or
music. You must be supposed to have come simply&mdash;though
there be five hundred of you&mdash;to pay a call on, let us say,
the Princesse de Guermantes. People marvelled at my influence
because I was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a
jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears. I
took a dislike on this account to the Prince d'Agrigente, who was
like all the people who, lacking in imagination but not in
covetousness, take a keen interest in what one is drinking and
ask if they may taste a little of it themselves. Which meant
that, every time, M. d'Agrigente, by diminishing my ration,
spoiled my pleasure. For this fruit juice can never be provided
in sufficient quantities to quench one's thirst for it. Nothing
is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the
colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled
backwards to the past season of its blossoming. Blushing like an
orchard in spring, or, it may be, colourless and cool like the
zephyr beneath the fruit-trees, the juice lets itself be breathed
and gazed into one drop by drop, and M. d'Agrigente prevented me,
regularly, from taking my fill of it. Despite these distillations
the traditional orangeade persisted like the <i>tilleul</i>. In
these humble kinds, the social communion was none the less
administered. In this respect, doubtless, the friends of M. and
Mme. de Guermantes had, after all, as I had originally imagined,
remained more different from the rest of humanity than their
outward appearance might have misled me into supposing. Numbers
of elderly men came to receive from the Duchess, together with
the invariable drink, a welcome that was often far from cordial.
Now this could not have been due to snobbishness, they themselves
being of a rank to which there was none superior; nor to love of
splendour; they did love it perhaps, but on less stringent social
conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it,
for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich
financier would have given anything in the world to have them
among the brilliant shooting-party she was giving for a couple of
days for the King of Spain. They had nevertheless declined her
invitation, and had come round without fail to inquire whether
Mme. de Guermantes was at home. They were not even certain of
finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own, or
sentiments of any great warmth; Mme. de Guermantes let fall now
and then, on the Dreyfus case, on the Republic, the Laws against
Religion, or even in an undertone on themselves, their
weaknesses, the dullness of their conversation, comments which
they had to appear not to notice. No doubt, if they kept up their
habit of coming there, it was owing to their superfine training
as epicures in things worldly, to their clear consciousness of
the prime and perfect quality of the social dish, with its
familiar, reassuring, sappy savour, free from blend or taint,
with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as
she who served them with it, remaining more 'noble' in this
respect than they themselves imagined. Now, on this occasion,
among the visitors to whom I was introduced after dinner, it so
happened that there was that General de Monserfeuil of whom the
Princesse de Parme had been speaking, while Mme. de Guermantes,
of whose drawing-room he was one of the regular frequenters, had
not known that he was going to be there that evening. He bowed
before me, on hearing my name, as though I had been the President
of the Supreme War Council. I had supposed it to be simply from
some deep-rooted unwillingness to oblige, in which the Duke, as
in wit if not in love, was his wife's accomplice, that the
Duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to M. de
Monserfeuil. And I saw in this an indifference all the more
blameworthy in that I seemed to have gathered from a few words
let fall by the Princess that Robert was in a post of danger from
which it would be prudent to have him removed. But it was by the
genuine malice of Mme. de Guermantes that I was revolted when,
the Princesse de Parme having timidly suggested that she might
say something herself and on her own responsibility to the
General, the Duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her.
"But Ma'am," she cried, "Monserfeuil has no sort of standing or
influence whatever with the new Government. You would be wasting
your breath." "I think he can hear us," murmured the Princess, as
a hint to the Duchess not to speak so loud. Without lowering her
voice: "Your Highness need not be afraid, he's as deaf as a
post," said the Duchess, every word reaching the General
distinctly. "The thing is, I believe M. de Saint-Loup is in a
place that is not very safe," said the Princess. "What is one to
do?" replied the Duchess. "He's in the same boat as everybody
else, the only difference being that it was he who originally
asked to be sent there. Besides, no, it's not really dangerous;
if it was, you can imagine how anxious I should be to help. I,
should have spoken to Saint-Joseph about it during dinner. He has
far more influence, and he's a real worker. But, as you see, he's
gone now. Still, asking him would be less awkward than going to
this one, who has; three of his sons in Morocco just now and has
refused to apply for them to be exchanged; he might raise that as
an objection. Since your Highness insists on it, I shall speak to
Saint-Joseph&mdash;if I see him again, or to Beautreillis. But if
I don't see either of them, you mustn't waste your pity on
Robert. It was explained to us the other day exactly where he is.
I'm sure he couldn't wish for a better place."</p>
<p>"What a pretty flower, I've never seen one like it; there's no
one like you, Oriane, for having such marvellous things in your
house," said the Princesse de Parme, who, fearing that General de
Monserfeuil might have overheard the Duchess, sought now to
change the conversation. I looked and recognised a plant of the
sort that I had watched Elstir painting. "I am so glad you like
them; they are charming, do look at their little purple velvet
collars; the only thing against them is&mdash;as may happen with
people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed&mdash;they
have a hideous name and a horrid smell. In spite of which I am
very fond of them. But what is rather sad is that they are
dying." "But they're growing in a pot, they aren't cut flowers,"
said the Princess. "No," answered the Duchess with a smile, "but
it comes to the same thing, as they're all ladies. It's a kind of
plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don't both grow on the
same stalk. I'm like people who keep a lady dog. I have to find a
husband for my flowers. Otherwise I shan't have any young ones!"
"How very strange. Do you mean to say that in
nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.?" "Yes! There are certain
insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage, as they do
with Sovereigns, by proxy, without the bride and bridegroom ever
having set eyes on one another. And so, I assure you, I always
tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as
possible, on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about,
in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive. But the odds
are too great. Fancy, he has first to have been seen by a person
of the same species and the opposite sex, and he must then have
taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house. He
hasn't appeared so far, I believe my plant can still qualify for
the white flower of a blameless life, but I must say a little
immodesty would please me better. It's just the same with that
fine tree we have in the courtyard; he will die childless because
he belongs to a kind that's very rare in these latitudes. In his
case, it's the wind that's responsible for consummating the
marriage, but the wall is a trifle high." "By Jove, yes," said M.
de Bréauté, "you ought to take just a couple of inches off the
top, that will be quite enough. There are certain operations one
ought to know how to perform. The flavour of vanilla we tasted in
the excellent ice you gave us this evening, Duchess, comes from a
plant called the vanilla tree. This plant produces flowers which
are both male and female, but a sort of solid wall set up between
them prevents any communication. And so we could never get any
fruit from them until a young Negro, a native of Réunion, by the
name of Albins, which by the way is rather an odd name for a
black man since it means 'white,' had the happy thought of using
the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact."
"Babal, you're divine, you know everything," cried the Duchess.
"But you yourself, Oriane, have told me things I had no idea of,"
the Princesse de Parme assured her. "I must explain to your
Highness that it is Swann who has always talked to me all about
botany. Sometimes when we were too bored to go to a tea-party or
a concert we would set off for the country, and he would shew me
extraordinary marriages between flowers, which was far more
amusing than going to human marriages&mdash;no wedding-breakfast
and no crowd in the sacristy. We never had time to go very far.
Now that motor-cars have come in, it Would be delightful.
Unfortunately, in the interval he himself has made an even more
astonishing marriage, which makes everything very difficult. Oh,
Ma'am, life is a dreadful business, we spend our whole time doing
things that bore us, and when by mere chance we come across
somebody with whom we could go and look at something really
interesting, he has to make a marriage like Swann's. Faced with
the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being
obliged to call upon a degrading person, I chose the former
calamity. Besides, when it comes to that, there was no need to go
quite so far. It seems that here, in my own little bit of garden,
more odd things happen in broad daylight than at
midnight&mdash;in the Bois de Boulogne! Only they attract no
attention, because among flowers it's all done quite simply, you
see a little orange shower, or else a very dusty fly coming to
wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower. And
that does the trick!" "The cabinet the plant is standing on is
splendid, too; it's Empire, I think," said the Princess, who, not
being familiar with the works of Darwin and his followers, was
unable to grasp the point of the Duchess's pleasantries. "It's
lovely, isn't it? I'm so glad Ma'am likes it," replied the
Duchess, "it's a magnificent piece. I must tell you that I've
always adored the Empire style, even when it wasn't in fashion. I
remember at Guermantes I got into terrible disgrace with my
mother-in-law because I told them to bring down from the attics
all the splendid Empire furniture Basin had inherited from the
Montesquious, and used it to furnish the wing we lived in." M. de
Guermantes smiled. He must nevertheless have remembered that the
course of events had been totally different. But, the witticisms
of the Princesse des Laumes at the expense of her mother-in-law's
bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which
the Prince was in love with his wife, his love for the latter had
been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual
inferiority of the former, a contempt which, however, went hand
in hand with a considerable attachment and respect. "The Iénas
have the same armchair with Wedgwood medallions, it's a lovely
thing, but I prefer my own;" said the Duchess, with the same air
of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of
the articles under discussion. "I know, of course, that they've
some marvellous things which I haven't got." The Princesse de
Parme remained silent. "But it's quite true; your Highness hasn't
seen their collection. Oh, you ought really to come there one day
with me, it's one of the most magnificent things in Paris. You'd
say it was a museum come to life." And since this suggestion was
one of the most 'Guermantes' of the Duchess's audacities,
inasmuch as the Iénas were for the Princesse de Parme rank
usurpers, their son bearing like her own the title of Duc de
Guastalla, Mme. de Guermantes in thus launching it could not
refrain (so far did the love that she bore for her own
originality prevail over the deference due to the Princesse de
Parme) from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of
amusement. They too made an effort to smile, at once frightened,
bewildered, and above all delighted to think that they were being
ear-witnesses of Oriane's very 'latest' and could carry it away
with them 'red hot.' They were only half shocked, knowing that
the Duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the
Courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling
and more enjoyable. Had she not, within the last few years,
brought together Princesse Mathilde and that Duc d'Aumale who had
written to the Princess's own brother the famous letter: "In my
family all the men are brave and the women chaste"? And inasmuch
as Princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear
anxious to forget that they are, the Duc d'Aumale and Princesse
Mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at Mme. de
Guermantes's that they had thereafter formed a defensive
alliance, with that faculty for forgetting the past which Louis
XVIII shewed when he took as his Minister Fouché, who had voted
the death of his brother. Mme. de Guermantes was now nourishing a
similar project of arranging a meeting between Princesse Murat
and the Queen of Naples. In the meantime, the Princesse de Parme
appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirs-apparent to
the Thrones of the Netherlands and Belgium, styled respectively
Prince of Orange and Duke of Brabant, had one offered to present
to them M. de Mailly Nesle, Prince d'Orange, and M. de Charlus,
Duc de Brabant. But, before anything further could happen, the
Duchess, whom Swann and M. de Charlus between them (albeit the
latter was resolute in ignoring the Iénas' existence) had with
great difficulty succeeded in making admire the Empire style,
exclaimed: "Honestly, Ma'am, I can't tell you how beautiful you
will think it! I must confess that the Empire style has always
had a fascination for me. But at the Iénas' it is really like a
hallucination. That sort of&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;reflux
from the Expedition to Egypt, and also the sweep forward into our
own times from Antiquity, all those things that invade our
houses, the Sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the
sofas, the serpents coiled round candelabra, a huge Muse who
holds out a little torch for you to play at <i>bouillotte</i>, or
has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against
your clock; and then all the Pompeian lamps, the little
boat-shaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on
the Nile so that you expect to see Moses climb out of them, the
classical chariots galloping along the bed
tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "They're not very
comfortable to sit in, those Empire chairs," the Princess
ventured. "No," the Duchess agreed, "but," she at once added,
insisting on the point with a smile: "I like being uncomfortable
on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk. I
like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but
the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawing-room
crosses his fasces and piles his laurels. I can assure you that
at the Iénas' one doesn't stop to think for a moment of how
comfortable one is, when one sees in front of one a great
strapping wench of a Victory painted in fresco on the wall. My
husband is going to say that I'm a very bad Royalist, but I'm
terribly disaffected, as you know, I can assure you that in those
people's house one comes to love all the big 'N's and all the
bees. Good gracious, after all for a good many years under our
Kings we weren't exactly surfeited with glory, and so these
warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them
even on the arms of the chairs, I must say I think it's all
rather fetching! Your Highness ought really." "Why, my dear, if
you think so," said the Princess, "but it seems to me that it
won't be easy." "But Ma'am will find that it will all go quite
smoothly. They are very good people, and no fools. We took Mme.
de Chevreuse there," added the Duchess, knowing the force of this
example, "she was enchanted. The son is really very pleasant. I'm
going to say something that's not quite proper," she went on,
"but he has a bedroom, and more especially a bed in it, in which
I should love to sleep&mdash;without him! What is even less
proper is that I went to see him once when he was ill and lying
in it. By his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long
Siren, stretched out at full length, a lovely thing with a
mother-of-pearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand.
I assure you," went on Mme. de Guermantes, reducing the speed of
her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which
she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips,
drawing them out with her long expressive hands, directing on the
Princess as she spoke a gentle, steady and searching gaze, "that
with the palms and the golden crown at the side, it was most
moving, it was just the arrangement of Gustave Moreau's <i>Death
and the Young Man</i> (your Highness must know that great work,
of course)." The Princesse de Parme, who did not know so much as
the painter's name, made violent movements with her head and
smiled ardently, in order to manifest her admiration for his
picture. But the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the
place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we
do not understand what people are trying to tell us. "A
good-looking boy, I believe?" she asked. "No for he's just like a
tapir. The eyes are a little those of a Queen Hortense on a
screen. But he has probably come to the conclusion that it is
rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance, and it is
lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really
rather a Mameluke appearance. You feel that the polisher must
call round every morning. Swann," she went on, reverting to the
bed of the young Duke, "was struck by the resemblance between
this Siren and Gustave Moreau's <i>Death</i>. But apart from
that," she added, her speech becoming more rapid though still
serious, so as to provoke more laughter, "there was nothing
really that could <i>strike</i> us, for it was only a cold in the
head, and the young man made a marvellous recovery." "They say
he's a snob?" put in M. de Bréauté, with a malicious twinkle,
expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had
said: "They tell me that he has only four fingers on his right
hand; is that so?" "G&mdash;ood g&mdash;racious, n&mdash;o,"
replied Mme. de Guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence.
"Perhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance,
because he's extremely young, but I should be surprised to hear
that he was really, for he's intelligent," she added, as though
there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between
snobbishness and intelligence. "He has wit, too, I've known him
to be quite amusing," she said again, laughing with the air of an
epicure and expert, as though the act of declaring that a person
could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from
the speaker, or as though the Duc de Guastalla's sallies were
recurring to her mind as she spoke. "Anyway, as he never goes
anywhere, he can't have much field for his snobbishness," she
wound up, forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the
Princesse de Parme to make overtures. "I cannot help wondering
what the Prince de Guermantes, who calls her Mme. Iéna, will say
if he hears that I've been to see her." "What!" cried the Duchess
with extraordinary vivacity. "Don't you know that it was we who
gave up to Gilbert" (she bitterly regretted that surrender now)
"a complete card-room done in the Empire style which came to us
from Quiou-Quiou, and is an absolute marvel! There was no room
for it here, though I think it would look better here than it
does with him. It's a thing of sheer beauty, half Etruscan, half
Egyptian.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "Egyptian?"
queried the Princess, to whom the word Etruscan conveyed little.
"Well, really, you know, a little of both. Swann told us that, he
explained it all to me, only you know I'm such a dunce. But then,
Ma'am, what one has to bear in mind is that the Egypt of the
Empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical Egypt,
nor their Roman with the Romans nor their
Etruria.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "Indeed," said
the Princess. "No, it's like what they used to call a Louis XV
costume under the Second Empire, when Anna de Monchy and dear
Brigode's mother were girls. Basin was talking to you just now
about Beethoven. We heard a thing of his played the other day
which was really quite good, though a little stiff, with a
Russian theme in it. It's pathetic to think that he believed it
to be Russian. In the same way as the Chinese painters believed
they were copying Bellini. Besides, even in the same country,
whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is
slightly novel, nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a
thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before
them. It takes at least forty years before they can manage to
make it out." "Forty years!" the Princess cried in alarm. "Why,
yes," went on the Duchess, adding more and more to her words
(which were practically my own, for I had just been expressing a
similar idea to her), thanks to her way of pronouncing them, the
equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics: "it's
like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does
not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future, an
individual endowed with a kind of <i>sense</i> which the human
race of his generation does not possess. I can hardly give myself
as an instance because I, on the contrary, have always loved any
interesting production from the very start, however novel it
might be. But really, the other day I was with the Grand Duchess
in the Louvre and we happened to pass before Manet's
<i>Olympia</i>. Nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it.
It looks just like an Ingres! And yet, heaven only knows how many
spears I've had to break for that picture, which I don't
altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of
<i>somebody</i>." "And is the Grand Duchess well?" inquired the
Princesse de Parme, to whom the Tsar's aunt was infinitely more
familiar than Manet's model. "Yes; we talked about you. After
all," she resumed, clinging to her idea, "the fact of the matter
is, as my brother-in-law Palamède always says, that one has
between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a
strange language. Though I admit that there's no one it's quite
so true of as Gilbert. If it amuses you to go to the Iénas', you
have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what
that poor fellow may think, who is a dear, innocent creature, but
really lives in a different world. I feel myself nearer, more
akin to my coachman, my horses even, than to a man who keeps on
harking back to what people would have thought under Philip the
Bold or Louis the Fat. Just fancy, when he goes for a walk in the
country, he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way,
quite in a friendly spirit, saying: 'Get on, clowns!' Really, I'm
just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if I heard myself
addressed by one of the 'recumbents' on the old gothic tombs.
It's all very well that animated gravestone's being my cousin; he
frightens me, and the only idea that comes into my head is to let
him stay in his Middle Ages. Apart from that, I quite admit that
he's never assassinated anyone." "I've just been seeing him at
dinner at Mme. de Villeparisis's," said the General, but without
either smiling at or endorsing the Duchess's pleasantries. "Was
M. de Norpois there?" asked Prince Von, whose mind still ran on
the Academy of Moral Sciences. "Why, yes;" said the General. "In
fact, he was talking about your Emperor." "It seems, the Emperor
William is highly intelligent, but he does not care for Elstir's
painting. Not that I'm saying this against him," said the
Duchess, "I quite share his point of view. Although Elstir has
done a fine portrait of me. You don't know it? It's not in the
least like me, but it's a remarkable piece of work. He is
interesting while one's sitting to him. He has made me like a
little old woman It's after the style of the <i>Regents of the
Hospital</i>, by Hals. I expect you know those sublimities, to
borrow my nephew's favourite expression," the Duchess turned to
myself, gently flapping her fan of black feathers. More than
erect on her chair, she flung her head nobly backwards, for,
while always a great lady, she was a trifle inclined to play the
great lady also. I said that I had been once to Amsterdam and The
Hague, but that to avoid confusing my mind, as my time was
limited, I had left out Haarlem. "Ah! The Hague! What a gallery!"
cried M. de Guermantes. I said to him that he had doubtless
admired Vermeer's <i>Street in Delft</i>. But the Duke was less
erudite than arrogant. Accordingly he contented himself with
replying in a tone of sufficiency, as was his habit whenever
anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery, or in the Salon,
which he did not remember having seen. "If it's to be seen, I saw
it!" "What? You've been to Holland, and you never visited
Haarlem!" cried the Duchess. "Why, even if you had only a quarter
of an hour to spend in the place, they're an extraordinary thing
to have seen, those Halses. I don't mind saying that a person who
only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a
tramway-car without stopping, supposing they were hung out to
view in the street, would open his eyes pretty wide." This
utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in
which artistic impressions are formed in our minds, and because
it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a
recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs.</p>
<p>M. de Guermantes, rejoicing that she should be speaking to me
with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me,
gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife, listened to what
she was saying about Franz Hals, and thought: "She rides
rough-shod over everything! Our young friend can go home and say
that he's had before his eyes a great lady of the old school, in
the full sense of the word, the like of whom couldn't be found
anywhere to-day." Thus I beheld the pair of them, withdrawn from
that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them
leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other
women, lingering, only, behind their contemporaries a little way,
and that not evenly, as in so many households of the Faubourg,
where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden, the
husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of
history, she remaining still Louis XV while her partner is
pompously Louis-Philippe. That Mme. de Guermantes should be like
other women had been for me at first a disappointment; it was
now, by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help,
almost a miracle. A Don John of Austria, an Isabella d'Esté,
situated for us in the world of names, have as little
communication with the great pages of history as the Méséglise
way had with the Guermantes. Isabella d'Este was no doubt in
reality a very minor Princess, similar to those who under Louis
XIV obtained no special place at Court. But seeming to us to be
of a unique and therefore incomparable essence, we cannot
conceive of her as being any less in greatness, so that a
supper-party with Louis XIV would appear to us only to be rather
interesting, whereas with Isabella d'Este we should find
ourselves, were we to meet her, gazing with our own eyes on a
supernatural heroine of romance. Well, after we have, in studying
Isabella d'Este, in transplanting her patiently from this world
of fairyland into that of history, established the fact that her
life, her thought contained nothing of that mysterious
strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name, once this
disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this
Princess for having had, of Mantegna's paintings, a knowledge
almost equal to that, hitherto despised by us and put, as
Françoise would have said, lower than the dirt, of M. Lafenestre.
After having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name
Guermantes, on descending the inner slope of the life of the
Duchess, I felt on finding there the names, familiar elsewhere,
of Victor Hugo, Franz Hals and, I regret to say, Vibert, the same
astonishment that an explorer, after having taken into account,
to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild
valley of Central America or Northern Africa, its geographical
remoteness, the strangeness of its flora, feels on discovering,
once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or
manchineels, inhabitants who (sometimes indeed among the ruins of
a Roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to Venus) are
engaged in reading <i>Mérope</i> or <i>Alzire</i>. And similarly,
so remote, so distinct from, so far superior to the educated
women of the middle classes whom I had known, the similar culture
by which Mme. de Guermantes had made herself, with no ulterior
motive, to gratify no ambition, descend to the level of people
whom she would never know, had the character&mdash;meritorious,
almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless&mdash;of an
erudition in Phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor.
"I might have shewn you a very fine one," said Mme. de
Guermantes, still speaking of Hals, "the finest in existence,
some people say, which was left to me by a German cousin.
Unfortunately, it turned out to be 'enfeoffed' in the
castle&mdash;you don't know the expression, nor I either," she
added, with her fondness for making jokes (which made her, she
thought, seem modern) at the expense of the old customs to which
nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached. "I am
glad you have seen my Elstirs, but, I must admit, I should have
been a great deal more glad if I could have done you the honours
of my Hals, this 'enfeoffed' picture." "I know the one," said
Prince Von, "it's the Grand Duke of Hesse's Hals." "Quite so; his
brother married my sister," said M. de Guermantes, "and his
mother and Oriane's were first cousins as well." "But so far as
M. Elstir is concerned," the Prince went on, "I shall take the
liberty of saying, without having any opinion of his work, which
I do not know, that the hatred with which the Emperor pursues him
ought not, it seems to me, to be counted against him. The Emperor
is a man of marvellous intelligence." "Yes, I've met him at
dinner twice, once at my aunt Sagan's and once at my aunt
Radziwill's, and I must say I found him quite unusual. I didn't
find him at all simple! But there is something amusing about him,
something 'forced,'" she detached the word, "like a green
carnation, that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not
please me enormously, a thing it is surprising that anyone should
have been able to create but which I feel would have been just as
well uncreated. I trust I'm not shocking you." "The Emperor is a
man of astounding intelligence," resumed the Prince, "he is
passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste
that is practically infallible, if a thing is good he spots it at
once and takes a dislike to it. If he detests anything there can
be no more doubt about it, the thing is excellent."Everyone
smiled. "You set my mind at rest," said the Duchess. "I should be
inclined to compare the Emperor," went on the Prince, who, not
knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist (that is to say,
as though it were spelt 'arkeologist'), never missed an
opportunity of using it, "to an old archaeologist" (but the
Prince said 'arsheologist') "we have in Berlin. If you put him in
front of a genuine Assyrian antique, he weeps. But if it is a
modern sham, if it is not really old, he does not weep. And so,
when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really
old, they take it to the old arsheologist. If he weeps, they buy
the piece for the Museum. If his eyes remain dry, they send it
back to the dealer, and prosecute him for fraud. Well, every time
I dine at Potsdam, if the Emperor says to me, of a play: 'Prince,
you must see that, it's a work of genius,' I make a note not to
go to it; and when I hear him fulminating against an exhibition,
I rush to see it at the first possible opportunity." "Norpois is
in favour of an Anglo-French understanding, isn't he?" said M. de
Guermantes. "What use would that be to you?" asked Prince Von,
who could not endure the English, in a tone at once of irritation
and cunning. "The English are so <i>schtubid</i>. I know, of
course, that it would not be as soldiers that they would help
you. But one can judge them, all the same, by the stupidity of
their Generals. A friend of mine was talking the other day to
Botha, you know, the Boer leader. He said to my friend: 'It's
terrible, an army like that. I rather like the English, as a
matter of fact, but just imagine that I, who am only a peasant,
have beaten them in every battle. And in the last, when I gave
way before a force twenty times the strength of my own, while I
myself surrendered, because I had to, I managed to take two
thousand prisoners! That was good enough, because I was only
commanding an army of farmers, but if those poor fools ever have
to stand up against a European army, one trembles to think what
may happen to them!' Besides, you have only to see how their
King, whom you know as well as I do, passes for a great man in
England." I barely listened to these stories, stories of the kind
that M. de Norpois used to tell my father; they supplied no food
for my favourite train of thought; and besides, even had they
possessed the elements which they lacked, they would have had to
be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during
those hours in which I dwelt in my skin, my well-brushed hair, my
starched shirt-front, in which, that is to say, I could feel
nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life. "Oh, I
don't agree with you at all," said Mme. de Guermantes, who felt
that the German Prince was wanting in tact, "I find King Edward
charming, so simple, and much cleverer than people think. And the
Queen is, even now, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in
the world." "But, Madame la Duchesse," said the Prince, who was
losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence,
"you must admit that if the Prince of Wales had been an ordinary
person there isn't a club that wouldn't have blackballed him, and
nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him. The Queen
is charming, exceedingly sweet and limited. But after all there
is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept
by their subjects, who get the big Jewish financiers to foot all
the bills they ought to pay themselves, and create them Baronets
in return. It's like the Prince of
Bulgaria.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." "He's our cousin," put in
the Duchess. "He's a clever fellow." "He's mine, too, but we
don't think him a good fellow on that account. No, it is us you
ought to make friends with, it's the Emperor's dearest wish, but
he insists on its coming from the heart. He says: 'What I want to
see is a hand clasped in mine, not waving a hat in the air.' With
that, you would be invincible. It would be more practical than
the Anglo-French friendship M. de Norpois preaches." "You know
him, of course," the Duchess said, turning to me, so as not to
leave me out of the conversation. Remembering that M. de Norpois
had said that I had once looked as though I wanted to kiss his
hand, thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to Mme.
de Guermantes, and in any event could have spoken of me to her
only with malice, since in spite of his friendship with my father
he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous, I did not
do what a man of the world would have done. He would have said
that he detested M. de Norpois, and had let him see it; he would
have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the
deliberate cause of the Ambassador's slanders, which would then
have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals. I said, on
the other hand, that, to my great regret, I was afraid that M. de
Norpois did not like me. "You are quite mistaken," replied the
Duchess, "he likes you very much indeed. You can ask Basin, for
if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things, he
certainly doesn't. He will tell you that we have never heard
Norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you.
And only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at
the Ministry. As he knew that you were not very strong and
couldn't accept it, he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind
thought to your father, for whom he has an unbounded admiration."
M. de Norpois was quite the last person whom I should have
expected to do me any practical service. The truth was that, his
being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit, those
people who had let themselves be taken in as I had by his outward
appearance of a Saint Louis delivering justice beneath an
oak-tree, by the sounds, easily modulated to pity, that emerged
from his somewhat too tuneful lips, believed in a deliberate
betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense
by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his
speech. These slanders were frequent enough with him. But that
did not prevent him from feeling attractions, from praising the
people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be
of use to them. "Not that I'm in the least surprised at his
appreciating you," said Mme. de Guermantes, "he's an intelligent
man. And I can quite understand," she added, for the benefit of
the rest of the party, making allusion to a purpose of marriage
of which I had heard nothing, "that my aunt, who has long ceased
to amuse him as an old mistress, may not seem of very much use to
him as a young wife. Especially as I understand that even as a
mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical
purpose, she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing
else. Boaz-Norpois can say, in the words of Victor Hugo:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;"><i>VoilÀ longtemps
que celle avec qui j'ai dormi,<br>
O Seigneur, a quitté ma couche pour la vôtre</i>!</div>
<p>Really, my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard
who have stood out all their lives against the Academy, and in
the end start a little academy of their own, or the unfrocked
priests who get up a little private religion. They should either
keep their frocks, or not stick to their profession. And who
knows," went on the Duchess with a meditative air, "it may be in
preparation for her widowhood, there's nothing sadder than the
weeds one's not entitled to wear." "Ah! If Mme. de Villeparisis
were to become Mme. de Norpois, I really believe our cousin
Gilbert would take to his bed," said General de Monserfeuil. "The
Prince de Guermantes is a charming man, but he is, really, very
much taken up with questions of birth and manners," said the
Princesse de Parme. "I went down to spend a few days with them in
the country, when the Princess, unfortunately, was ill in bed. I
was accompanied by Petite." (This was a nickname that was given
to Mme. d'Hunolstein because she was enormously stout.) "The
Prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps, and pretended
not to see Petite. We went up to the first floor, to the door
into the reception rooms, and then, stepping back to make way for
me, he said: 'Oh, how d'ye do, Mme. d'Hunolstein?' (he always
calls her that now, since her separation) pretending to have
caught sight of Petite for the first time, so as to shew her that
he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps."
"That doesn't surprise me in the least. I don't need to tell
you," said the Duke, who regarded himself as extremely modern,
more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth, and in
fact a Republican, "that I have not many ideas in common with my
cousin. Ma'am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed
on most subjects as day and night. But I must say that if my aunt
were to marry Norpois, for once I should be of Gilbert's opinion.
To be the daughter of Florimond de Guise, and then to make a
marriage like that would be enough, as the saying is, to make a
cat laugh; what more can I say?" These last words, which the Duke
uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence, were here quite
superfluous. But he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which
made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no
place for them elsewhere. They were for him, among other things,
almost a question of prosody. "Remember, though," he added, "that
the Norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place, of a good
stock."</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Basin, it's really not worth your while to poke
fun at Gilbert if you're going to speak the same language as he
does," said Mme. de Guermantes, for whom the 'goodness' of a
family, no less than that of a wine, consisted in its age. But,
less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband, she
made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the
Guermantes spirit, and despised rank in her speech while ready to
honour it by her actions. "But aren't you some sort of cousins?"
asked General de Monserfeuil. "I seem to remember that Norpois
married a La Rochefoucauld." "Not in that way at all, she
belonged to the branch of the Ducs de La Rochefoucauld, my
grandmother came from the Ducs de Doudeauville. She was own
grandmother to Edouard Coco, the wisest man in the family,"
replied the Duke, whose views of wisdom were somewhat
superficial, "and the two branches haven't intermarried since
Louis XIV's time; the connexion would be rather distant." "I say,
that's interesting; I never knew that," said the General.
"However," went on M. de Guermantes, "his mother, I believe, was
the sister of the Duc de Montmorency, and had originally been
married to a La Tour d'Auvergne. But as those Montmorencys are
barely Montmorencys, while those La Tour d'Auvergnes are not La
Tour d'Auvergnes at all, I cannot see that it gives him any very
great position. He says&mdash;and this should be more to the
point&mdash;that he's descended from Saintrailles, and as we
ourselves are in a direct line of
descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>
<p>There was at Combray a Rue de Saintrailles, to which I had
never given another thought. It led from the Rue de la
Bretonnerie to the Rue de l'Oiseau. And as Saintrailles, the
companion of Joan of Arc, had, by marrying a Guermantes, brought
into that family the County of Combray, his arms were quartered
with those of Guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in
Saint-Hilaire. I saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps,
while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name,
Guermantes, in the forgotten tone in which I used to hear it long
ago, so different from that in which it was used to signify the
genial hosts with whom I was dining this evening. If the name,
Duchesse de Guermantes, was for me a collective name, it was so
not merely in history, by the accumulation of all the women who
had successively borne it, but also in the course of my own short
life, which had already seen, in this single Duchesse de
Guermantes, so many different women superimpose themselves, each
one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient
consistency. Words do not change their meaning as much in
centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years. Our
memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain
faithful. We have not room enough, in our mental field, to keep
the dead there as well as the living. We are obliged to build
over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a
chance excavation, such as the name Saintrailles had just wrought
in my mind. I felt that it would be useless to explain all this,
and indeed a little while earlier I had lied by implication in
not answering when M. de Guermantes said to me: "You don't know
our old wheedler?" Perhaps he was quite well aware that I did
know him, and it was only from good breeding that he did not
press the question.</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes drew me out of my meditation. "Really, I
find all that sort of thing too deadly. Listen, it's not always
as boring as this at my parties. I hope that you will soon come
and dine again as a compensation, with no pedigrees next time,"
she murmured, incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm
which I could find in her house and of having sufficient humility
to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium, filled with
plants of another day.</p>
<p>What Mme. de Guermantes believed to be disappointing my
expectations was on the contrary what in the end&mdash;for the
Duke and the General went on to discuss pedigrees now without
stopping&mdash;saved my evening from becoming a complete
disappointment. How could I have felt otherwise until now? Each
of my fellow-guests at dinner, smothering the mysterious name
under which I had only at a distance known and dreamed of them
with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all
the people I knew, had given me the impression of flat vulgarity
which the view on entering the Danish port of Elsinore would give
to any passionate admirer of <i>Hamlet</i>. No doubt those
geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest
glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain
measure formed their faces, their intellects and their
prejudices, but survived in them only as does the cause in the
effect, that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to
extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination.</p>
<p>And these old-time prejudices restored in a flash to the
friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes their vanished poetry.
Assuredly, the motions in the possession of nobles, which make of
them the scholars, the etymologists of the language not of words
but of names (and this, moreover, relatively only to the ignorant
mass of the middle classes, for if at the same level of
mediocrity a devout Catholic would be better able to stand
questioning upon the details of the Liturgy than a free-thinker,
on the other hand an anti-clerical archaeologist can often give
points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the
latter's own church), those notions, if we are going to confine
ourselves to the truth, that is to say to the spirit, had not for
these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a
man of simple birth. They knew perhaps better than myself that
the Duchesse de Guise was Princess of Cleves, of Orleans and of
Porcien, and all the rest, but they had known, long before they
knew all these names, the face of the Duchesse de Guise which
thenceforward the names reflected back to them. I had begun with
the fairy&mdash;were she fated shortly to perish&mdash;they with
the woman.</p>
<p>In middle-class families one sometimes sees jealousies spring
up if the younger sister is married before the elder. So the
aristocratic world, Courvoisiers especially but Guermantes also,
reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities,
by a system of child's-play which I had me' originally (and this
gave it for me its sole charm) in books. Is it not just as though
Tallemant des Réaux were speaking of the Guermantes, and not of
the Rohans, when he relates with evident satisfaction how M. de
Guéménée cried to his brother: "You can come in here; this is not
the Louvre!" and said of the Chevalier de Rohan (because he was a
natural son of the Duc de Clermont): "At any rate, he's a
Prince." The only thing that distressed me in all this talk was
to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about
the charming Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg found as much
credence in this drawing-room as they had among Saint-Loup's
friends. Plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer
than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone.
People repeated the same old stories, or enriched them with
others equally untrue. I gathered that the Princesse de
Luxembourg herself, while apparently defending her nephew,
supplied weapons for the assault. "You are wrong to stand up for
him," M. de Guermantes told me, as Saint-Loup had told me before.
"Why, without taking into consideration the opinion of our
family, who are unanimous about him, you have only to talk to his
servants, and they, after all, are the people who know him best.
M. de Luxembourg gave his little Negro page to his nephew. The
Negro came back in tears: 'Grand Duke beaten me; me no bad boy;
Grand Duke naughty man,' it's really too much. And I can speak
with some knowledge, he's Oriane's cousin." I cannot, by the way,
say how many times in the course of this evening I heard the word
'cousin' used. On the one hand, M. de Guermantes, almost at every
name that was mentioned, exclaimed: "But he's Oriane's cousin!"
with the sudden joy of a man who, lost in a forest, reads at the
ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a
metal plate, and followed by quite a low number of kilometres,
the words: "Belvédère Casimir-Perier" and "Croix du
Grand-Veneur," and gathers from them that he is on the right
road. On the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly
different connexion (which was here the exception to the
prevailing rule) by the Turkish Ambassadress, who had come in
after dinner. Devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real
power of assimilating knowledge, she would pick up with equal
facility the story of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand or the
details of sexual perversion among birds. It would have been
impossible to 'stump' her on any of the most recent German
publications, whether they dealt with political economy, mental
aberrations, the various forms of onanism, or the philosophy of
Epicurus. She was, incidentally, a dangerous person to listen to,
for, perpetually in error, she would point out to you as being of
the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue, would put you
on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly
honourable, and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem
always to have come out of a book, not so much because they are
serious as because they are so wildly improbable.</p>
<p>She was at this period little received in society. She had
been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real
social brilliance, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, but as a
general rule had confined herself, of necessity, in the noblest
families, to obscure scions whom the Guermantes had ceased to
know. She hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by
quoting the most historic names of the little-known people who
were her friends. At once M. de Guermantes, thinking that she was
referring to people who frequently dined at his table, quivered
with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and
shouted the rallying-cry: "But he's Oriane's cousin! I know him
as well as I know my own name. He lives in the Rue Vaneau. His
mother was Mlle. d'Uzès." The Ambassadress was obliged to admit
that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game. She tried to
connect her friends with those of M. de Guermantes by cutting
across his track: "I know quite well who' you mean. No, it's not
those ones, they're cousins." But this cross-current launched by
the unfortunate Ambassadress ran but a little way. For M. de
Guermantes, losing interest, answered: "Oh, then I don't know
who' you're talking about." The Ambassadress offered no reply,
for if she never knew anyone nearer than the 'cousins' of those
whom she ought to have known in person, very often these
'cousins' were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M.
de Guermantes, would flow a fresh wave of "But she's Oriane's
cousin!" words which seemed to have for the Duke the same
practical value as certain epithets, convenient to the Roman
poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for
their hexameters. At least the explosion of: "But she's Oriane's
cousin!" appeared to me quite natural when applied to the
Princesse de Guermantes, who was indeed very closely related to
the Duchess. The Ambassadress did not seem to care for this
Princess. She said to me in an undertone: "She is stupid. No, she
is not so beautiful as all that. That claim is usurped. Anyhow,"
she went on, with an air at once reflective, rejecting and
decided, "I find her most uncongenial." But often the cousinship
extended a great deal further than this, Mme. de Guermantes
making it a point of honour to address as 'Aunt' ladies with whom
it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common
without going back at least to Louis XV; just as, whenever the
'hardness' of the times brought it about that a
multimillionairess married a prince whose great-great-grandfather
had espoused, as had Oriane's also, a daughter of Louvois, one of
the chief joys of the fair American was to be able, after a first
visit to the Hôtel de Guermantes, where she was, incidentally,
more or less coldly received and hotly cross-examined, to say
'Aunt' to Mme. de Guermantes, who allowed her to do so with a
maternal smile. But little did it concern me what birth meant for
M. de Guermantes and M. de Monserfeuil; in the conversations
which they held on the subject I sought only for a poetic
pleasure. Without being conscious of it themselves, they procured
me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors
speaking of the soil or the tides, realities too little detached
from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the
beauty which personally I proceeded to extract from them.</p>
<p>Sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact,
of a date that a name reminded me. Hearing M. de Guermantes
recall that M. de Bréauté's mother had been a Choiseul and his
grandmother a Lucinge, I fancied I could see beneath the
commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs, bleeding still in
two globes of crystal, those august relics, the hearts of Mme. de
Praslin and of the Duc de Berri. Others were more voluptuous: the
fine and flowing hair of Mme. de Tallien or Mme. de Sabran.</p>
<p>Better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had
been, M. de Guermantes found himself the possessor of memories
which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion
stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures,
authentic, indifferent and majestic, which taken as a whole look
remarkably well. The Prince d'Agrigente having asked why Prince
Von had said, in speaking of the Duc d'Aumale, 'my uncle,' M. de
Guermantes had replied: "Because his mother's brother, the Duke
of Wurtemberg, married a daughter of Louis-Philippe." At once I
was lost in contemplation of a casket, such as Carpaccio or
Memling used to paint, from its first panel in which the
Princess, at the wedding festivities of her brother the Duc
d'Orléans, appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her
resentment at having seen the return, empty-handed, of the
ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand
of the Prince of Syracuse, down to the last, in which she had
just given birth to a son, the Duke of Wurtemberg (the first
cousin of the Prince whom I had met at dinner), in that castle
called Fantaisie, one of those places which are as aristocratic
as certain families. They, moreover, outlasting a single
generation of men, see attached to themselves more than one
historical personage. In this one, especially, survive side by
side memories of the Margravine of Bayreuth, of this other
somewhat fantastic Princess (the Duc d'Orléans's sister), to whom
it was said that the name of her husband's castle made a distinct
appeal, of the King of Bavaria, and finally of Prince Von, to
whom it was simply his own postal address, at which he had just
asked the Duc de Guermantes to write to him, for he had succeeded
to it, and let it only during the Wagner festivals, to the Prince
de Polignac, another delightful 'fantasist.' When M. de
Guermantes, to explain how he was related to Mme. d'Arpajon, was
obliged, going so far and so simply, to climb the chain formed by
the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to
Marie-Louise or Colbert, it was still the same thing in each
case; a great historical event appeared only in passing, masked,
unnatural, reduced, in the name of a property, in the Christian
names of a woman, so selected because she was the granddaughter
of Louis-Philippe and Marie-Amélie, considered no longer as King
and Queen of the French, but merely in the extent to which in
their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage. (We
see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of Balzac,
where the most illustrious personages figure only according to
their connexion with the <i>Comédie Humaine</i>, Napoleon occupy
a space considerably less than that allotted to Rastignac, and
occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young
ladies of Cinq-Cygne.) Similarly the aristocracy, in its heavy
structure, pierced with rare windows, admitting a scanty
daylight, shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same
massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque
age, embodies all our history, immures it, beetles over it.</p>
<p>Thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees
with names which in taking order, in composing themselves with
relation to one another, in linking themselves to one another by
an increasingly numerous connexion, resembled those finished
works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated, in
which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification
which it confers on them.</p>
<p>M. de Luxembourg's name having come up again in the course of
the conversation, the Turkish Ambassadress told us how, the young
bride's grandfather (he who had made that immense fortune out of
flour and cereals) having invited M. de Luxembourg to luncheon,
the latter had written to decline, putting on the envelope: "M.
So-and-So, Miller," to which the grandfather had replied: "I am
all the more disappointed that you were not able to come, my dear
friend, because I should have been able to enjoy your society
quite intimately, for we were quite an intimate party, just
ourselves, and there would have been only the Miller, his Son,
and you." This story was not merely utterly distasteful to me,
who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau's writing to
the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune, moreover, he was
expecting to inherit) and addressing him as 'Miller'; but
furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start, the word
'Miller' having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the
title of La Fontaine's fable. But there is in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain a silliness so great, when it is aggravated by
malice, that they decided that the letter had been sent and that
the grandfather, as to whom at once everyone confidently declared
that he was a remarkable man, had shewn a prettier wit than his
grandson-in-law. The Duc de Châtellerault tried to take advantage
of this story to tell the one that I had heard in the café:
"Everyone had to lie down!"&mdash;but scarcely had he begun, or
reported M. de Luxembourg's pretension that in his wife's
presence M. de Guermantes ought to stand up, when the Duchess
stopped him with the protest: "No, he is very absurd, but not as
bad as that." I was privately convinced that all these stories at
the expense of M. de Luxembourg were equally untrue, and that
whenever I found myself face to face with any of the reputed
actors or spectators I should hear the same contradiction. I
asked myself, nevertheless, whether the contradiction just
uttered by Mme. de Guermantes had been inspired by regard for
truth or by self-esteem. In either event the latter quality
succumbed to malice, for she went on, with a laugh: "Not that I
haven't had my little fling at him too, for he invited me to
luncheon, wishing to make me know the Grand Duchess of
Luxembourg, which is how he has the good taste to describe his
wife when he's writing to his aunt. I sent a reply expressing my
regret, and adding: As for the 'Grand Duchess of Luxembourg' (in
inverted commas), tell her that if she is coming to see me I am
at home every Thursday after five. I have even had another little
fling. Happening to be at Luxembourg, I telephoned, asking him to
ring me up. His Highness was going to luncheon, had just risen
from luncheon, two hours went by and nothing happened; so then I
employed another method: 'Will you tell the Comte de Nassau to
come and speak to me?' Cut to the quick, he was at the instrument
that very minute." Everyone laughed at the Duchess's story, and
at other analogous, that is to say (I am convinced of it) equally
untrue stories, for a man more intelligent, better, more refined,
in a word more exquisite than this Luxembourg-Nassau I have never
met. The sequel will shew that it was I who was in the right. I
must admit that, in the midst of her onslaught, Mme. de
Guermantes had still a kind word for him. "He was not always like
that," she informed us. "Before he went off his head, like the
man in the story-book who thinks he's become king, he was no
fool, and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to
speak of it in really quite a nice way, as something he could
never have dreamed of: 'It's just like a fairy-tale; I shall have
to make my entry into Luxembourg in a fairy coach,' he said to
his uncle d'Ornessan, who answered&mdash;for you know it's not a
very big place, Luxembourg: 'A fairy coach! I'm afraid, my dear
fellow, you'd never get it in. I should suggest that you take a
goat carriage.' Not only did this not annoy Nassau, but he was
the first to tell us the story, and to laugh at it." "Ornessan is
a witty fellow, and he's every reason to be; his mother was a
Montjeu. He's in a very bad way now, poor Ornessan." This name
had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms
which otherwise would have gone on for ever. In fact, M. de
Guermantes had to explain that M. d'Ornessan's great-grandmother
had been the sister of Marie de Castille Montjeu, the wife of
Timoléon de Lorraine, and consequently Oriane's aunt, with the
result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies, while
the idiot of a Turkish Ambassadress breathed in my ear: "You
appear to be very much in the Duke's good books; have a care!"
and, on my demanding an explanation: "I mean to say, you
understand what I mean, he's a man to whom one could safely
entrust one's daughter, but not one's son." Now if ever, on the
contrary, a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a
lover of women, it was certainly the Duc de Guermantes. The state
of error, the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth, were
for the Ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could
not move. "His brother Mémé, who is, as it happens, for other
reasons altogether" (he did not bow to her) "profoundly
uncongenial to me, is genuinely distressed by the Duke's morals.
So is their aunt Villeparisis. Ah, now, her I adore! There is a
saint of a woman for you, the true type of the great ladies of
the past. It's not only her actual virtue that's so wonderful but
her restraint. She still says 'Monsieur' to the Ambassador
Norpois whom she sees every day, and who, by the way, left an
excellent impression behind him in Turkey."</p>
<p>I did not even reply to the Ambassadress, in order to listen
to the genealogies. They were not all of them important. There
came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those
unexpected alliances, which, M. de Guermantes informed me, was a
misalliance, but not without charm, for, uniting under the July
Monarchy the Duc de Guermantes and the Duc de Fezensac with the
two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator, it gave the
two Duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically
middle-class, 'Louisphilippically' Indian. Or else, under Louis
XIV, a Norpois had married the daughter of the Duc de Mortemart,
whose illustrious title struck, in the remoteness of that epoch,
the name&mdash;which I had found colourless and might have
supposed to be modern&mdash;of Norpois, carving deeply upon it
the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases, moreover, it was
not only the less well-known name that benefited by the
association; the other, grown commonplace by the fact of its
lustre, struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure
aspect, just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant
colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in
black. The sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to
me to have been endowed, as they sprang to take their places by
the side of others from which I should have supposed them to be
remote, was due not to my ignorance alone; the country-dances
which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no
less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title, being always
attached to a piece of land, used to follow it from one family to
another, so much so that, for example, in the fine feudal
structure that is the title of Duc de Nemours or Duc de
Chevreuse, I was able to discover successively hidden, as in the
hospitable abode of a hermit-crab, a Guise, a Prince of Savoy, an
Orléans, a Luynes. Sometimes several remained in competition for
a single shell: for the Principality of Orange the Royal House of
the Netherlands and MM. de Mailly-Nesle for the Duchy of Brabant
the Baron de Charlus and the Royal House of Belgium, various
others for the titles of Prince of Naples, Duke of Parma Duke of
Reggio. Sometimes it was the other way; the shell had been so'
long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never
occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could
have been, at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent,
the name of a family. And so, when M. de Guermantes replied to a
question put to him by M. de Monserfeuil: "No, my cousin was a
fanatical Royalist; she was the daughter of the Marquis de
Féterne, who played a certain part in the Chouan rising," on
seeing this name Féterne, which had been for me, since my stay at
Balbec, the name of a country house, become, what I had never
dreamed that it could possibly be, a family name, I felt the same
astonishment as in reading a fairy-tale, where turrets and a
terrace come to life and turn into men and women. In this sense
of the words, we may say that history, even mere family history,
gives life to the old stones of a house. There have been in
Parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it, who
were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit,
who were equally well born as the Duc de Guermantes or the Duc de
La Trémoïlle. They have now fallen into oblivion because, as they
left no descendants, their name which we no longer hear sounds
like a name unknown; at most, the name of a thing beneath which
we never think to discover the name of any person, it survives in
some country house, some remote village. The day is not distant
when the traveller who, in the heart of Burgundy, stops in the
little village of Charlus to look at its church, if he has not
sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its
tombstones, will go away ignorant that this name, Charlus, was
that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land. This
thought reminded me that it was time to go, and that while I was
listening to M. de Guermantes talking pedigrees, the hour was
approaching at which I had promised to call upon his brother.
"Who knows," I continued to muse, "whether one day Guermantes
itself may not appear nothing more than a place-name, save to the
archaeologists who, stopping by chance at Combray and standing
beneath the window of Gilbert the Bad, have the patience to
listen to the account given them by Theodore's successor or to
read the Curé's guide?" But so long as a great name is not
extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who
bear it; and there can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, the
interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in
my eyes lay in the fact that one can, starting from to-day,
follow their ascending course, step by step, to a point far
beyond the fourteenth century, recover the diaries and
correspondence of all the forebears of M. de Charlus, of the
Prince d'Agrigente, of the Princesse de Parme, in a past in which
an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middle-class
family, and in which we make out, in the luminous backward
projection of a name, the origin and persistence of certain
nervous characteristics, certain vices, the disorders of one or
another Guermantes. Almost identical pathologically with their
namesakes of the present day, they excite from century to century
the startled interest of their correspondents, whether these be
anterior to the Princess Palatine and Mme. de Motteville, or
subsequent to the Prince de Ligne.</p>
<p>However, my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with
my aesthetic pleasure. The names cited had the effect of
disincarnating the Duchess's guests, whom, for all they might
call themselves Prince d'Agrigente or de Cystira, their mask of
flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had
transformed into ordinary mortals, so much so that I had made my
landing on the ducal door-mat not as upon the threshold (as I had
supposed) but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world
of names. The Prince d'Agrigente himself, as soon as I heard that
his mother had been a Damas, a granddaughter of the Duke of
Modena, was delivered, as from an unstable chemical alloy, from
the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him, and
went to form with Damas and Modena, which themselves were only
titles, a combination infinitely more seductive. Each name
displaced by the attractions of another, with which I had never
suspected it of having any affinity, left the unalterable
position which it had occupied in my brain, where familiarity had
dulled it, and, speeding to join the Mortemarts, the Stuarts or
the Bourbons, traced with them branches of the most graceful
design and an ever-changing colour. The name Guermantes itself
received from all the beautiful names&mdash;extinct, and so all
the more glowingly rekindled&mdash;with which I learned only now
that it was connected, a new sense and purpose, purely poetical.
At the most, at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from
the exalted stem, I could see it flower in some face of a wise
king or illustrious princess, like the sire of Henri IV or the
Duchesse de Longueville. But as these faces, different in this
respect from those of the party around me, were not discoloured
for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable
mediocrity, they remained, in their handsome outlines and rainbow
iridescence, homogeneous with those names which at regular
intervals, each of a different hue, detached themselves from the
genealogical tree of Guermantes, and disturbed with no foreign or
opaque matter the buds&mdash;pellucid, alternate,
many-coloured&mdash;which (like, in the old Jesse windows, the
ancestors of Jesus) blossomed on either side of the tree of
glass.</p>
<p>Already I had made several attempts to slip away, on account,
more than for any other reason, of the triviality which my
presence at it imparted to the gathering, albeit it was one of
those which I had long imagined as being so beautiful&mdash;as it
would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness
present. At least my departure would permit the other guests,
once the profane intruder was no longer among them, to constitute
themselves at length into a secret conclave. They would be free
to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had
met together, for it could obviously not have been to talk of
Franz Hals or of avarice, and to talk of them in the same way as
people talk in middle-class society. They uttered nothing but
trivialities, doubtless because I was in the room, and I felt
with some compunction, on seeing all these pretty women kept
apart, that I was preventing them by my presence from carrying
on, in the most precious of its drawing-rooms, the mysterious
life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I
was trying at every moment to effect, M. and Mme. de Guermantes
carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone, by
keeping me in the room. A more curious thing still, several of
the ladies who had come hurrying, delighted, beautifully dressed,
with constellations of jewels, to be present at a party which,
through my fault only, differed in no essential point from those
that are given elsewhere than in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, any
more than one feels oneself at Balbec to be in a town that
differs from what one's eyes are accustomed to see&mdash;several
of these ladies retired not at all disappointed, as they had
every reason to be, but thanking Mme. de Guermantes most
effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent, as
though on the other days, those on which I was not present,
nothing more used to occur.</p>
<p>Was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all
these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the
penetration of middle-class women into their so exclusive
drawing-rooms&mdash;for dinners such as this? The same, had I
been absent? The suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment,
but it was too absurd. Plain commonsense enabled me to brush it
aside. And then, if I had adopted it, what would have been left
of the name Guermantes, already so degraded since Combray?</p>
<p>It struck me that these flower-maidens were, to a strange
extent, either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious
to make that person pleased with them, for more than one of them,
to whom I had not uttered, during the whole course of the
evening, more than two or three casual remarks, the stupidity of
which had left me blushing, made a point, before leaving the
drawing-room, of coming to tell me, fastening on me her fine
caressing eyes, straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids
that followed the curve of her bosom, what an intense pleasure it
had been to her to make my acquaintance, and to speak to
me&mdash;a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner&mdash;of
her desire to 'arrange something' after she had 'fixed a day'
with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the
room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that
lady&mdash;one must never depart before Royalty&mdash;was one of
the two reasons, neither of which I had guessed, for which the
Duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining. As soon as Mme.
de Parme had risen, it was like a deliverance. Each of the ladies
having made a genuflexion before the Princess, who raised her up
from the ground, they received from her, in a kiss, and like a
benediction which they had craved kneeling, the permission to ask
for their cloaks and carriages. With the result that there
followed, at the front door, a sort of stentorian recital of
great names from the History of France. The Princesse de Parme
had forbidden Mme. de Guermantes to accompany her downstairs to
the hall for fear of her catching cold, and the Duke had added:
"There, Oriane, since Ma'am gives you leave, remember what the
doctor told you."</p>
<p>"I am sure the Princesse de Parme was <i>most pleased</i> to
take dinner with you." I knew the formula. The Duke had come the
whole way across the drawing-room in order to utter it before me
with an obliging, concerned air, as though he were handing me a
diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits. And I guessed from
the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke, and
which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face,
that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind
which he would continue to make to the very end of his life, like
one of those honorific and easy posts which, even when paralytic,
one is still allowed to retain.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to leave, the lady in waiting reappeared
in the drawing-room, having forgotten to take away some wonderful
carnations, sent up from Guermantes, which the Duchess had
presented to Mme. de Parme. The lady in waiting was somewhat
flushed, one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding,
for the Princess, so kind to everyone else, could not contain her
impatience at the stupidity of her attendant. And so the latter
picked up the flowers and ran quickly, but to preserve her air of
ease and independence flung at me as she passed: "The Princess
says I'm keeping her waiting; she wants to be gone, and to have
the carnations as well. Good lord! I'm not a little bird, I can't
be in two places at once."</p>
<p>Alas! the rule of not leaving before Royalty was not the only
one. I could not depart at once, for there was another: this was
that the famous lavishness, unknown to the Courvoisiers, with
which the Guermantes, whether opulent or practically ruined,
excelled in entertaining their friends, was not only a material
lavishness, of the kind that I had often experienced with Robert
de Saint-Loup, but also a lavish display of charming words, of
courteous actions, a whole system of verbal elegance supplied
from a positive treasure-house within. But as this last, in the
inactivity of fashionable existence, must remain unemployed, it
expanded at times, sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive
effusion, all the more intense, which might, in Mme. de
Guermantes, have led one to suppose a genuine affection for
oneself. Which she did, for that matter, feel at the moment when
she let it overflow, for she found then in the society of the
friend, man or woman, with whom she happened to be a sort of
intoxication, in no way sensual, similar to that which music
produces in certain people; she would suddenly detach a flower
from her bodice, or a medallion, and present it to someone with
whom she would have liked to prolong the evening, with a
melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have
led to nothing but idle talk, into which nothing could have
passed of the nervous pleasure, the fleeting emotion, similar to
the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind
them of exhaustion and regret. As for the friend, it did not do
for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises, more
exhilarating than anything he had ever heard, tendered by these
women who, because they feel with so much more force the
sweetness of a moment, make of it, with a delicacy, a nobility of
which normally constituted creatures are incapable, a compelling
masterpiece of grace and goodness, and have no longer anything of
themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived. Their
affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it;
and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all
the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will
permit them just as easily, a few days later, to seize hold of
your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their
visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one
of those 'musical moments' which are so brief.</p>
<p>In the hall where I asked a footman for my snowboots which I
had brought as a precaution against the snow, several flakes of
which had already fallen, to be converted rapidly into slush, not
having realised that they were hardly fashionable, I felt, at the
contemptuous smile on all sides, a shame which rose to its
highest pitch when I saw that Mme. de Parme had not gone and was
watching me put on my American 'rubbers.' The Princess came
towards me. "Oh! What a good idea," she exclaimed, "it's so
practical! There's a sensible man for you. Madame, we shall have
to get a pair of those," she went on to her lady in waiting,
while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other
guests crowded round me to inquire where I had managed to find
these marvels. "With those on, you will have nothing to fear even
if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go. You're
independent of the weather," said the Princess to me. "Oh! If it
comes to that, your Royal Highness can be reassured," broke in
the lady in waiting with a knowing air, "it will not snow again."
"What do you know about it, Madame?" came witheringly from the
excellent Princesse de Parme, who alone could succeed in piercing
the thick skin of her lady in waiting. "I can assure your Royal
Highness, it cannot snow again. It is a physical impossibility."
"But why?" "It cannot snow any more, they have taken the
necessary steps to prevent it, they have put down salt in the
streets!" The simple-minded lady did not observe either the anger
of the Princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience, for
instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile,
paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with
Admiral Jurien de la Gravière: "Not that it matters, after all.
This gentleman must have stout sea-legs. What's bred in the
bone!"</p>
<p>Then, having escorted the Princesse de Parme to her carriage,
M. de Guermantes said to me, taking hold of my greatcoat: "Let me
help you into your skin." He had ceased even to smile when he
employed this expression, for those that were most vulgar had for
that very reason, because of the Guermantes affectation of
simplicity, become aristocratic.</p>
<p>An exaltation that sank only into melancholy, because it was
artificial, was what I also, although quite differently from Mme.
de Guermantes, felt once I had finally left her house, in the
carriage that was taking me to that of M. de Charlus. We can at
pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which
one rises in ourselves, emanates from our deepest impressions,
the other comes to us from without. The first carries with it
naturally a joy, the joy that springs from the life of the
creator. The other current, that which endeavours to introduce
into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are
stirred, is not accompanied by pleasure; but we can add a
pleasure to it, by the shock of reaction, in an intoxication so
feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom, into melancholy,
whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion, and all those
nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well, in
the carriage which was taking me to M. de Charlus, I was a prey
to this second sort of exaltation, widely different from that
which is given us by a personal impression, such as I had
received in other carriages, once at Combray, in Dr. Percepied's
gig, from which I had seen painted against the setting sun the
spires of Martinville, another day at Balbec, in Mme. de
Villeparisis's barouche, when I strove to identify the
reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees. But
in this third carriage, what I had before my mind's eye were
those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at Mme. de
Guermantes's dinner-table, for example Prince Von's stories about
the German Emperor, General Botha and the British Army. I had
slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through
the lenses of which, once we are no longer ourselves, once,
endowed with the spirit of society, we no longer wish to receive
our life save from other people, we cast into relief what they
have said and done. Like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling
for the waiter who has been serving him, I marvelled at my good
fortune, a good fortune not realised by me, it is true, at the
actual moment, in having dined with a person who knew William II
so well, and had told stories about him that were&mdash;upon my
word&mdash;really witty. And, as I repeated to myself, with the
Prince's German accent, the story of General Botha, I laughed out
loud, as though this laugh, like certain kinds of applause which
increase one's inward admiration, were necessary to the story as
a corroboration of its comic element. Through the magnifying
lenses even those of Mme. de Guermantes's pronouncements which
had struck me as being stupid (as for example that on the Hals
pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramway-car)
took on a life, a depth that were extraordinary. And I must say
that, even if this exaltation was quick to subside, it was not
altogether unreasonable. Just as there may always come a day when
we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone
in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with
whom we are in love, to whom he can introduce us, and thus offers
us both utility and gratification, attributes in each of which we
should have supposed him to be entirely lacking, so there is no
conversation, any more than there are personal relations, from
which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some
benefit. What Mme. de Guermantes had said to me about the
pictures which it would be interesting to see, even from a
tramway-car, was untrue, but it contained a germ of truth which
was of value to me later on.</p>
<p>Similarly the lines of Victor Hugo which I had heard her quote
were, it must be admitted, of a period earlier than that in which
he became something more than a new man, in which he brought to
light, in the order of evolution, a literary species till then
unknown, endowed with more complex organs than any then in
existence. In these first poems, Victor Hugo is still a thinker,
instead of contenting himself, like Nature, with supplying food
for thought. His 'thoughts' he at that time expressed in the most
direct form, almost in the sense in which the Duke employed the
word when, feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the
guests at his big parties at Guermantes should, in the visitors'
book, append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical
reflexion, he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: "Your
name, my dear fellow, but no 'thoughts' please!" Well, it was
these 'thoughts' of Victor Hugo (almost as entirely absent from
the <i>Légende des Siècles</i> as 'airs,' as 'melodies' are from
Wagner's later manner) that Mme. de Guermantes admired in the
early Hugo. Nor was she altogether wrong. They were touching, and
already round about them, without their form's having yet the
depth which it was to acquire only in later years, the rolling
tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond
comparison with the lines that one might discover in a Corneille,
for example, lines in which a Romanticism that is intermittent,
restrained and so all the more moving, nevertheless has not at
all penetrated to the physical sources of life, modified the
unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is
latent. And so I had been wrong in confining myself, hitherto, to
the later volumes of Hugo. Of the earlier, of course, it was only
a fractional part that Mme. de Guermantes used to embellish her
conversation. But simply by quoting in this way an isolated line
one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold. The lines that
had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised
in turn, summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the
heart of which they were normally embedded, that my magnetised
hands could not hold out for longer than forty-eight hours
against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were
bound up the <i>Orientales</i> and the <i>Chants du
Crépuscule</i>. I cursed Franchise's footman for having made a
present to his native village of my copy of the <i>Feuilles
d'Automne</i>, and sent him off, with not a moment to be lost, to
procure me another. I read these volumes from cover to cover and
found peace of mind only when I suddenly came across, awaiting me
in the light in which she had bathed them, the lines that I had
heard Mme. de Guermantes quote. For all these reasons,
conversations with the Duchess resembled the discoveries that we
make in the library of a country house, out of date, incomplete,
incapable of forming a mind, lacking in almost everything that we
value, but offering us now and then some curious scrap of
information, for instance the quotation of a fine passage which
we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after
years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the
great. We are then, by having found Balzac's preface to the
<i>Chartreuse</i>, or some unpublished letters of Joubert,
tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there, the
sterile frivolity of which, for this windfall of a single
evening, we forget.</p>
<p>From this point of view, if the fashionable world had been
unable, at the first moment, to provide what my imagination
expected, and must consequently strike me first of all by what it
had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its
difference, still it revealed itself to me by degrees as
something quite distinct. Great noblemen are almost the only
people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants; their
conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land,
houses, as people used to live in them long ago, old customs,
everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant.
Even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his
aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives,
his mother, his uncles, his great-aunts keep him in touch, when
he recalls his childhood, with the conditions of a life almost
unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme.
de Guermantes would not have pointed out, but would immediately
have perceived, all the lapses from the traditional customs. She
was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men, when
there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for
the women. As for the pall, the use of which Bloch would
doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins, on account of
the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals, M.
de Guermantes could remember the time when, as a child, he had
seen it borne at the wedding of M. de Mailly-Nesle. While
Saint-Loup had sold his priceless 'Genealogical Tree,' old
portraits of the Bouillons, letters of Louis XIII, in order to
buy Carrières and furniture in the modern style, M. and Mme. de
Guermantes, moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art
may have played only a minor part, and which left them themselves
more insignificant than before, had kept their marvellous Boule
furniture, which presented a picture attractive in a different
way to an artist. A literary man would similarly have been
enchanted by their conversation, which would have been for
him&mdash;for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him
company&mdash;a living dictionary of all those expressions which
every day are becoming more and more forgotten: Saint-Joseph
cravats, children dedicated to the Blue, and so forth, which one
finds to-day only among those people who have constituted
themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past.
The pleasure that a writer, more than among other writers, feels
among them is not without danger, for there is a risk of his
coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in
themselves, of his transferring them bodily into his work,
still-born in that case, exhaling a tedium for which he consoles
himself with the reflexion: "It is attractive because it's true;
that is how people do talk." These aristocratic conversations had
moreover the charm, with Mme. de Guermantes, of being couched in
excellent French. For this reason they made permissible on the
Duchess's part her hilarity at the words 'viaticum,' 'cosmic,'
'pythian,' 'pre-eminent,' which Saint-Loup used to
employ&mdash;as, similarly, at his Bing furniture.</p>
<p>When all was said, very different in this respect from what I
had been able to feel before the hawthorns, or when I tasted a
crumb of <i>madeleine</i>, the stories that I had heard at Mme.
de Guermantes's remained alien to me. Entering for a moment into
me, who was only physically possessed by them, one would have
said that, being of a social, not an individual nature, they were
impatient to escape. I writhed in my seat in the carriage like
the priestess of an oracle. I looked forward to another
dinner-party at which I might myself become a sort of Prince Von
to Mme. de Guermantes, and repeat them. In the meantime they made
my lips quiver as I stammered them to myself, and I tried in vain
to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a
centrifugal force. And so it was with a feverish impatience not
to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in
a carriage where, for that matter, I atoned for the lack of
conversation by soliloquising aloud, that I rang the bell at M.
de Charlus's door, and it was in long monologues with myself, in
which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and
gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me, that
I spent the whole of the time during which I was kept waiting in
a drawing-room into which a footman shewed me and where I was
incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained. I
felt so urgent a need that M. de Charlus should listen to the
stories which I was burning to tell him that I was bitterly
disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in
bed, and that I might have to go home to sleep off by myself my
drunkenness of words. I had just noticed, in fact, that I had
been twenty-five minutes&mdash;that they had perhaps forgotten
about me&mdash;in this room of which, despite this long wait, I
could at the most have said that it was very big, greenish in
colour, and contained a large number of portraits. The need to
speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing
things, and in this case the absence of any description of my
external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my
internal state. I was preparing to leave the room to try to get
hold of some one, and if I found no one to make my way back to
the hall and have myself let out, when, just as I had risen from
my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the
floor, a manservant came in, with a troubled expression:
"Monsieur le Baron has been engaged all evening, Sir," he told
me. "There are still several people waiting to see him. I am
doing everything I possibly can to get him to receive you, I have
already telephoned up twice to the secretary." "No; please don't
bother. I had an appointment with M. le Baron, but it is very
late already, and if he is busy this evening I can come back
another day." "Oh no, Sir, you must not go away," cried the
servant. "M. le Baron might be vexed. I will try again." I was
reminded of the things I had heard about M. de Charlus's servants
and their devotion to their master. One could not quite say of
him as of the Prince de Conti that he sought to give pleasure as
much to the valet as to the Minister, but he had shewn such skill
in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of
personal favour that at night, when, his body-servants assembled
round him at a respectful distance, after running his eye over
them he said: "Coignet, the candlestick!" or "Ducret, the
nightshirt!" it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to
withdraw, jealous of him who had been singled out by his master's
favour. Two of them, indeed, who could not abide one another,
used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on
the most flimsy pretext with a message to the Baron, if he had
gone upstairs earlier than usual, in the hope of being invested
for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt. If
he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject
outside the scope of his duty, still more if in winter, in the
garden, knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold, he said
to him, after ten minutes: "Put your cap on!" the others would
not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight, in their jealousy
of the great distinction that had been conferred on him. I waited
ten minutes more, and then, after requesting me not to stay too
long as M. le Baron was tired and had had to send away several
most important people who had made appointments with him many
days before, they admitted me to his presence. This setting with
which M. de Charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal
less impressive than the simplicity of his brother Guermantes,
but already the door stood open, I could see the Baron, in a
Chinese dressing-gown, with his throat bare, lying upon a sofa.
My eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat, its nap
flashing like a mirror, which had been left on a chair with a
cape, as though the Baron had but recently come in. The valet
withdrew. I supposed that M. de Charlus would rise to greet me.
Without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes.
I went towards him, I said good evening; he did not hold out his
hand, made no reply, did not ask me to take a chair. After a
moment's silence I asked him, as one would ask an ill-mannered
doctor, whether it was necessary for me to remain standing. I
said this without any evil intention, but my words seemed only to
intensify the cold fury on M. de Charlus's face. I was not aware,
as it happened, that at home, in the country, at the Château de
Charlus, he was in the habit, after dinner (so much did he love
to play the king) of sprawling in an armchair in the
smoking-room, letting his guests remain standing round him. He
would ask for a light from one, offer a cigar to another and
then, after a few minutes' interval, would say: "But Argencourt,
why don't you sit down? Take a chair, my dear fellow," and so
forth, having made a point of keeping them standing simply to
remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them
to be seated. "Put yourself in the Louis XIV seat," he answered
me with an imperious air, as though rather to force me to move
away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated. I took
an armchair which was comparatively near. "Ah! so that is what
you call a Louis XIV seat, is it? I can see you have been well
educated," he cried in derision. I was so much taken aback that I
did not move, either to leave the house, as I ought to have done,
or to change my seat, as he wished. "Sir," he next said to me,
weighing each of his words, to the more impertinent of which he
prefixed a double yoke of consonants, "the interview which I have
condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires
to be nameless, will mark the final point in our relations. I
shall not conceal from you that I had hoped for better things! I
should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little, which
one ought not to do, even with people who are ignorant of their
value, simply out of the respect due to oneself, were I to tell
you that I had felt a certain <i>attraction</i> towards you. I
think, however, that <i>benevolence</i>, in its most actively
protecting sense, would exceed neither what I felt nor what I was
proposing to display. I had, immediately on my return to Paris,
given you to understand, while you were still at Balbec, that you
could count upon me." I who remembered with what a torrent of
abuse M. de Charlus had parted from me at Balbec made an
instinctive gesture of contradiction. "What!" he cried with fury,
and indeed his face, convulsed and white, differed as much from
his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one
finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand
serpents writhing in spray and foam, "do you mean to pretend that
you did not receive my message&mdash;almost a
declaration&mdash;that you were to remember me? What was there in
the way of decoration round the cover of the book that I sent
you?" "Some very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments," I
told him. "Ah!" he replied, with an air of scorn, "these young
Frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land. What would be
said of a young Berliner who had never heard of the
<i>Walküre</i>? Besides, you must have eyes to see and see not,
since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in
front of that particular treasure. I can see that you know no
more about flowers than you do about styles; don't protest that
you know about styles," he cried in a shrill scream of rage, "you
can't even tell me what you are sitting on. You offer your
hindquarters a Directory <i>chauffeuse</i> as a Louis XIV
<i>bergère</i>. One of these days you'll be mistaking Mme. de
Villeparisis's knees for the seat of the rear, and a fine mess
you'll make of things then. It's precisely the same; you didn't
even recognise on the binding of Bergotte's book the lintel of
myosotis over the door of Balbec church. Could there be any
clearer way of saying to you: 'Forget me not!'?" I looked at M.
de Charlus. Undoubtedly his magnificent head, though repellent,
yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives; you would have
called him an Apollo grown old; but an olive-hued, bilious juice
seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth; as for
intellect, one could not deny that his, over a vast compass, had
taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his
brother Guermantes. But whatever the fine words with which he
coloured all his hatreds, one felt that, even if there was now an
offended pride, now a disappointment in love, or a rancour, or
sadism, a love of teasing, a fixed obsession, this man was
capable of doing murder, and of proving by force of logic that he
had been right in doing it and was still superior by a hundred
cubits in moral stature to his brother, his sister-in-law, or any
of the rest. "Just as, in Velazquez's <i>Lances</i>," he went on,
"the victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank, as
is the duty of every noble nature, since I was everything and you
were nothing, it was I who took the first steps towards you. You
have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe
as an act of greatness. But I have not allowed myself to be
discouraged. Our religion inculcates patience. The patience I
have shewn towards you will be counted, I hope, to my credit, and
also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as
impertinence, were it within your power to offer any impertinence
to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits; but after
all, Sir, all this is now neither here nor there. I have
subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world
has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness, and
which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all, the
only one that can separate the good grain from the tares. I could
scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success,
for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few. But at
least, and this is the conclusion which I am entitled to draw
from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth, at
least I intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious
fabrications." So far, I had never dreamed that M. de Charlus's
rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had
been repeated to him; I searched my memory; I had not spoken
about him to anyone. Some evil-doer had invented the whole thing.
I protested to-M. de Charlus that I had said absolutely nothing
about him. "I don't think I can have annoyed you by saying to
Mme. de Guermantes that I was a friend of yours." He gave a
disdainful smile, made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of
its highest register, and there, without strain, attacking the
shrillest and most insolent note: "Oh! Sir," he said, returning
by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation, and seeming
to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale, "I
think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse
yourself of having said that we were <i>friends</i>. I do not
look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily
mistake a piece of Chippendale for a rococo <i>chaire</i>, but
really I do not believe," he went on, with vocal caresses that
grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips
what was actually a charming smile, "I do not believe that you
can ever have said, or thought, that we were <i>friends</i>! As
for your having boasted that you had been <i>presented</i> to me,
had <i>talked</i> to me, knew me slightly, had obtained, almost
without solicitation, the prospect of coming one day under my
<i>protection</i>, I find it on the contrary very natural and
intelligent of you to have done so. The extreme difference in age
that there is between us enables me to recognise without
absurdity that that <i>presentation</i>, those <i>talks</i>, that
vague prospect of future <i>relations</i> were for you, it is not
for me to say an honour, but still, when all is said and done, an
advantage as to which I consider that your folly lay not in
divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it. I will
go so far as to say," he went on, passing abruptly for a moment
from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy
that I expected him to burst into tears, "that when you left
unanswered the proposal I made to you here in Paris it seemed to
me so unheard-of an act on your part, coming from you who had
struck me as well brought up and of a good <i>bourgeois</i>
family," (on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little
whistle of impertinence) "that I was foolish enough to imagine
all the excuses that never really happen, letters miscarrying,
addresses copied down wrong. I can see that on my part it was
great foolishness, but Saint Bonaventure preferred to believe
that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of
lying. Anyhow, that is all finished now, the idea did not attract
you, there is no more to be said. It seems to me only that you
might have brought yourself," (and there was a genuine sound of
weeping in his voice) "were it only out of consideration for my
age, to write to me. I had conceived and planned for you certain
infinitely seductive things, which I had taken good care not to
tell you. You have preferred to refuse without knowing what they
were; that is your affair. But, as I tell you, one can always
<i>write</i>. In your place, and indeed in my own, I should have
done so. I like my place, for that reason, better than
yours&mdash;I say 'for that reason' because I believe that we are
all equal, and I have more fellow-feeling for an intelligent
labourer than for many of our dukes. But I can say that I prefer
my place to yours, because what you have done, in the whole
course of my life, which is beginning now to be a pretty long
one, I am conscious that I have never done." His head was turned
away from the light, and I could not see if his eyes were
dropping tears as I might have supposed from his voice. "I told
you that I had taken a hundred steps towards you; the only effect
of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me. Now it
is for me to withdraw, and we shall know one another no longer. I
shall retain not your name but your story, so that at moments
when I might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts,
good manners, or simply the intelligence not to allow an
unparalleled opportunity to escape them, I may remember that that
is ranking them too highly. No, that you should have said that
you knew me, when it was true&mdash;for henceforward it ceases to
be true&mdash;I regard that as only natural, and I take it as an
act of homage, that is to say something pleasant. Unfortunately,
elsewhere and in other circumstances, you have uttered remarks of
a very different nature." "Sir, I swear to you that I have said
nothing that could insult you." "And who says that I am
insulted?" he cried with fury, flinging himself into an erect
posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining
motionless, while, as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his
face, his voice became alternately shrill and grave, like the
deafening onrush of a storm. (The force with which he habitually
spoke, which used to make strangers turn round in the street, was
multiplied an hundredfold, as is a musical <i>forte</i> if,
instead of being played on the piano, it is played by an
orchestra, and changed into a <i>fortissimo</i> as well. M. de
Charlus roared.) "Do you suppose that it is within your power to
insult me? You evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking?
Do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little
gentlemen of your type, heaped one upon another, would succeed in
slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes?" A moment
before this my desire to persuade M. de Charlus that I had never
said, nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place
to a mad rage, caused by the words which were dictated to him
solely, to my mind, by his colossal pride. Perhaps they were
indeed the effect, in part at any rate, of this pride. Almost all
the rest sprang from a feeling of which I was then still
ignorant, and for which I could not therefore be blamed for not
making due allowance. I could at least, failing this unknown
element, have mingled with his pride, had I remembered the words
of Mme. de Guermantes, a trace of madness. But at that moment the
idea of madness never even entered my head. There was in him,
according to me, only pride, in me there was only fury. This fury
(at the moment when M. de Charlus ceased to shout, in order to
refer to his august toes, with a majesty that was accompanied by
a grimace, a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers), this
fury could contain itself no longer. With an impulsive movement,
I wanted to strike something, and, a lingering trace of
discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older
than myself, and even, in view of their dignity as works of art,
the pieces of German porcelain that were grouped around him, I
flung myself upon the Baron's new silk hat, dashed it to the
ground, trampled upon it, began blindly pulling it to pieces,
wrenched off the brim, tore the crown in two, without heeding the
vociferations of M. de Charlus, which continued to sound, and,
crossing the room to leave it, opened the door. One on either
side of it, to my intense stupefaction, stood two footmen, who
moved slowly away, so as to appear only to have been casually
passing in the course of their duty. (I afterwards learned their
names; one was called Burnier, the other Charmel.) I was not
taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely
gait seemed to offer me. It was highly improbable; three others
appeared to me to be less so; one that the Baron sometimes
entertained guests against whom, as he might happen to need
assistance (but why?), he deemed it necessary to keep
reinforcements posted close at hand. The second was that, drawn
by curiosity, they had stopped to listen at the keyhole, not
thinking that I should come out so quickly. The third, that, the
whole of the scene which M. de Charlus had made with me having
been prepared and acted, he had himself told them to listen, from
a love of the spectacular combined, perhaps, with a '<i>nunc
erudimini</i>' from which each would derive a suitable
profit.</p>
<p>My anger had not calmed that of M. de Charlus, my departure
from the room seemed to cause him acute distress; he called me
back, made his servants call me back, and finally, forgetting
that a moment earlier, when he spoke of his 'august toes,' he had
thought to make me a witness of his own deification, came running
after me at full speed, overtook me in the hall, and stood
barring the door. "There, now," he said, "don't be childish; come
back for a minute; he who loveth well chasteneth well, and if I
have chastened you well it is because I love you well." My anger
had subsided; I let the word 'chasten' pass, and followed the
Baron, who, summoning a footman, ordered him without a trace of
self-consciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered
hat, which was replaced by another. "If you will tell me, Sir,
who it is that has treacherously maligned me," I said to M. de
Charlus, "I will stay here to learn his name and to confute the
impostor." "Who? Do you not know? Do you retain no memory of the
things you say? Do you think that the people who do me the
service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding
secrecy? And do you imagine that I am going to betray a person to
whom I have given my promise?" "Sir, is it impossible then for
you to tell me?" I asked, racking my brains in a final effort to
discover (and discovering no one) to whom I could have spoken
about M. de Charlus. "You did not hear me say that I had given a
promise of secrecy to my informant?" he said in a snapping voice.
"I see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine
one for futile persistence. You ought to have at least the
intelligence to profit by a final conversation, and so to speak
as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing." "Sir,"
I replied, moving away from him, "you insult me; I am unarmed,
because you are several times my age, we are not equally matched;
on the other hand, I cannot convince you; I have already sworn to
you that I have said nothing." "I am lying, then, am I?" he cried
in a terrifying tone, and with a bound forwards that brought him
within a yard of myself. "Some one has misinformed you." Then in
a gentle, affectionate, melancholy voice, as in those symphonies
which are played without any break between the different
movements, in which a graceful <i>scherzo</i>, amiable and
idyllic, follows the thunder-peals of the opening pages: "It is
quite possible," he told me. "Generally speaking, a remark
repeated at second hand is rarely true. It is your fault if, not
having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which I had
held out to you, you have not furnished me, by that open speech
of daily intercourse which creates confidence, with the unique
and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a
traitor. Either way, true or false, the remark has done its work.
I can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me. I
cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well, for I
have chastened you well enough but I no longer love you." While
saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell. A
different footman appeared. "Bring something to drink and order
the brougham." I said that I was not thirsty and besides had a
carriage waiting. "They have probably paid him and sent him
away," he told me, "you needn't worry about that. I am ordering a
carriage to take you home.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
If you're anxious about the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. I
could have given you a room
here.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." I said that my
mother would be uneasy. "Ah! Of course, yes. Well, true or false,
the remark has done its work. My affection, a trifle premature,
had flowered too soon, and, like those apple trees of which you
spoke so poetically at Balbec, it has been unable to withstand
the first frost." If M. de Charlus's affection for me had not
been destroyed, he could hardly have acted differently, since,
while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted, he made me
sit down, drink, asked me to stay the night, and was going now to
send me home. He had indeed an air of dreading the moment at
which he must part from me and find himself alone, that sort of
slightly anxious fear which his sister-in-law and cousin
Guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to
force me to stay a little longer, with something of the same
momentary fondness for myself, of the same effort to prolong the
passing minute. "Unfortunately," he went on, "I have not the
power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed. My
affection for you is quite dead. Nothing can revive it. I believe
that it is not unworthy of me to confess that I regret it. I
always feel myself to be a little like Victor Hugo's Boaz: 'I am
widowed and alone, and the darkness gathers o'er me.'"</p>
<p>I passed again with him through the big green drawing-room. I
told him, speaking quite at random, how beautiful I thought it.
"Ain't it?" he replied. "It's a good thing to be fond of
something. The woodwork is Bagard. What is rather charming, d'you
see, is that it was made to match the Beauvais chairs and the
consoles. You observe, it repeats the same decorative design.
There used to be only two places where you could see this, the
Louvre and M. d'Hinnisdal's house. But naturally, as soon as I
had decided to come and live in this street, there cropped up an
old family house of the Chimays which nobody had ever seen before
because it came here expressly for <i>me</i>. On the whole, it's
good. It might perhaps be better, but after all it's not bad.
Some pretty things, ain't there? These are portraits of my
uncles, the King of Poland and the King of England, by Mignard.
But why am I telling you all this? You must know it as well as I
do, you were waiting in this room. No? Ah, then they must have
put you in the blue drawing-room," he said with an air that might
have been either impertinence, on the score of my want of
interest, or personal superiority, in not having taken the
trouble to ask where I had been kept waiting. "Look now, in this
cabinet I have all the hats worn by Mlle. Elisabeth, by the
Princesse de Lamballe, and by the Queen. They don't interest you,
one would think you couldn't see. Perhaps you are suffering from
an affection of the optic nerve. If you like this kind of beauty
better, here is a rainbow by Turner beginning to shine out
between these two Rembrandts, as a sign of our reconciliation.
You hear: Beethoven has come to join him." And indeed one could
hear the first chords of the third part of the Pastoral Symphony,
'Joy after the Storm,' performed somewhere not far away, on the
first landing no doubt, by a band of musicians. I innocently
inquired how they happened to be playing that, and who the
musicians were. "Ah, well, one doesn't know. One never does know.
They are unseen music. Pretty, ain't it?" he said to me in a
slightly impertinent tone, which, nevertheless, suggested somehow
the influence and accent of Swann. "But you care about as much
for it as a fish does for little apples. You want to go home,
regardless of any want of respect for Beethoven or for me. You
are uttering your own judgment and condemnation," he added, with
an affectionate and mournful air, when the moment had come for me
to go. "You will excuse my not accompanying you home, as good
manners ordain that I should," he said to me. "Since I have
decided not to see you again, spending five minutes more in your
company would make very little difference to me. But I am tired,
and I have a great deal to do." And then, seeing that it was a
fine night: "Very well, yes, I will come in the carriage, there
is a superb moon which I shall go on to admire from the Bois
after I have taken you home. What, you don't know how to shave;
even on a night when you've been dining out, you have still a few
hairs here," he said, taking my chin between two fingers, so to
speak magnetised, which after a moment's resistance ran up to my
ears, like the fingers of a barber. "Ah! It would be pleasant to
look at the 'blue light of the moon' in the Bois with some one
like yourself," he said to me with a sudden and almost
involuntary gentleness, then, in a sadder tone: "For you are
nice, all the same; you could be nicer than anyone," he went on,
laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder. "Originally, I
must say that I found you quite insignificant." I ought to have
reflected that he must find me so still. I had only to recall the
rage with which he had spoken to me, barely half an hour before.
In spite of this I had the impression that he was, for the
moment, sincere, that his kindness of heart was prevailing over
what I regarded as an almost delirious condition of
susceptibility and pride. The carriage was waiting beside us, and
still he prolonged the conversation. "Come along," he said
abruptly, "jump in, in five minutes we shall be at your door. And
I shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations,
and for all time. It is better, since we must part for ever, that
we should do so, as in music, on a perfect chord." Despite these
solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again, I
could have sworn that M. de Charlus, annoyed at having forgotten
himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my
feelings, would not have been displeased to see me once again.
Nor was I mistaken, for, a moment later: "There, now," he said,
"if I hadn't forgotten the most important thing of all. In memory
of your grandmother, I have had bound for you a curious edition
of Mme. de Sévigné. That is what is going to prevent this from
being our last meeting. One must console oneself with the
reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day.
Just look how long they took over the Congress of Vienna." "But I
could call for it without disturbing you," I said obligingly.
"Will you hold your tongue, you little fool," he replied with
anger, "and not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding
as a small matter the honour of being probably (I do not say
certainly, for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands
you the volumes) received by me." Then, regaining possession of
himself: "I do not wish to part from you on these words. No
dissonance, before the eternal silence of the dominant." It was
for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return
home after harsh words of dissension. "You would not care to come
to the Bois?" he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative
as affirmative, and that not, as it seemed to me, because he did
not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his
self-esteem might meet with a refusal. "Oh, very well," he went
on, still postponing our separation, "it is the moment when, as
Whistler says, the <i>bourgeois</i> go to bed" (perhaps he wished
now to capture me by my self-esteem) "and the right time to begin
to look at things. But you don't even know who Whistler was!" I
changed the conversation and asked him whether the Princesse
d'Iéna was an intelligent person. M. de Charlus stopped me, and,
adopting the most contemptuous tone that I had yet heard him use,
"Oh! There, Sir," he informed me, "you are alluding to an order
of nomenclature with which I have no concern. There is perhaps an
aristocracy among the Tahitians, but I must confess that I know
nothing about it. The name which you have just mentioned,
strangely enough, did sound in my ears only a few days ago. Some
one asked me whether I would condescend to allow them to present
to me the young Duc de Guastalla. The request astonished me, for
the Duc de Guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me,
for the simple reason that he is my cousin, and has known me all
his life; he is the son of the Princesse de Parme, and, as a
young kinsman of good upbringing, he never fails to come and pay
his respects to me on New Year's Day. But, on making inquiries, I
discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son
of the person in whom you are interested. As there exists no
Princess of that title, I supposed that my friend was referring
to some poor wanton sleeping under the Pont d'Iéna, who had
picturesquely assumed the title of Princesse d'Iéna, just as one
talks about the Panther of the Batignolles, or the Steel King.
But no, the reference was to a rich person who possesses some
remarkable furniture which I had seen and admired at an
exhibition, and which has this advantage over the name of its
owner that it is genuine. As for this self-styled Duc de
Guastalla, he, I supposed, must be my secretary's stockbroker;
one can procure so many things with money. But no; it was the
Emperor, it appears, who amused himself by conferring on these
people a title which simply was not his to give. It was perhaps a
sign of power, or of ignorance, or of malice; in any case, I
consider, it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these
unconscious usurpers. But really, I cannot help you by throwing
any light on the matter; my knowledge begins and ends with the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, where, among all the Courvoisiers and
Gallardons, you will find, if you can manage to secure an
introduction, plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of
Balzac who will amuse you. Naturally, all that has nothing to do
with the position of the Princesse de Guermantes, but without me
and my 'Open, Sesame' her portals are unapproachable." "It is
really very lovely, isn't it, Sir, the Princesse de Guermantes's
mansion?" "Oh, it's not very lovely. It's the loveliest thing in
the world. Next to the Princess herself, of course." "The
Princesse de Guermantes is better than the Duchesse de
Guermantes?" "Oh! There's no comparison." (It is to be observed
that, whenever people in society have the least touch of
imagination, they will crown or dethrone, to suit their
affections or their quarrels, those whose position appeared most
solid and unalterably fixed.)</p>
<p>"The Duchesse de Guermantes" (possibly, in not calling her
'Oriane,' he wished to set a greater distance between her and
myself) "is delightful, far superior to anything you can have
guessed. But, after all, she is incommensurable with her cousin.
The Princess is exactly what the people in the Markets might
imagine Princess Metternich to have been, but old Metternich
believed she had started Wagner, because she knew Victor Maurel.
The Princesse de Guermantes, or rather her mother, knew the man
himself. Which is a distinction, not to mention the incredible
beauty of the lady. And the Esther gardens alone!" "One can't see
them?" "No, you would have to be invited, but they never invite
<i>anyone</i> unless I intervene." But at once withdrawing, after
casting it at me, the bait of this offer, he held out his hand,
for we had reached my door. "My part is played, Sir, I will
simply add these few words. Another person will perhaps some day
offer you his affection, as I have done. Let the present example
serve for your instruction. Do not neglect it. Affection is
always precious. What one cannot do by oneself in this life,
because there are things which one cannot ask, nor do, nor wish,
nor learn by oneself, one can do in company, and without needing
to be Thirteen, as in Balzac's story, or Four, as in <i>The Three
Musketeers</i>. Good-bye."</p>
<p>He must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of
going to look at the moonlight, for he asked me to tell his
coachman to drive home. At once he made a sharp movement as
though he had changed his mind. But I had already given the
order, and, so as not to lose any more time, went across now to
ring the bell, without its entering my head that I had been
meaning to tell M. de Charlus, about the German Emperor and
General Botha, stories which had been an hour ago such an
obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had
sent flying far out of my mind.</p>
<p>On entering my room I saw on my desk a letter which
Franchise's young footman had written to one of his friends and
had left lying there. Now that my mother was away, there was no
liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking; I was the
more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter
which, without an envelope, lay spread out before me and (which
was my sole excuse) seemed to offer itself to my eye.</p>
<blockquote>"Dear Friend and Cousin,<br>
<br>
"I hope this finds you in good health, and the same with all the
young folk, particularly my young godson Joseph whom I have not
yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom I prefer to you all as
being my godson, these relics of the heart they have their dust
also, upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands. Besides
dear friend and cousin who can say that to-morrow you and your
dear wife my cousin Marie, will not both of you be cast headlong
down into the bottom of the sea, like the sailor clinging to the
mast on high, for this life is but a dark valley. Dear friend I
must tell you that my principal occupation, which will astonish
you I am certain, is now poetry which I love passionately, for
one must somehow pass the time away. And so dear friend do not be
too surprised if I have not answered your last letter before now,
in place of pardon let oblivion come. As you are aware, Madame's
mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly
exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors. The day of her
interment was a great day for all Monsieur's relations came in
crowds as well as several Ministers. It took them more than two
hours to get to the cemetery, which will make you all open your
eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won't do as
much for mother Michu. So all my life to come can be but one long
sob. I am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which
I have recently learned. What would you say, my dear friends, if
I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on
that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy
of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the
Duchesse de Guermantes, people whose very names you have never
heard in our ignorant villages. Therefore it is with pleasure
that I am going to send the works of Racine, of Victor Hugo, of
Pages Choisies de Chenedolle, of Alfred de Musset, for I would
cure the land in which I saw the light of ignorance which leads
unerringly to crime. I can think of nothing more to say to you
and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best
regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister Rose.
May it never be said of her: And Rose she lived only as live the
roses, as has been said by Victor Hugo, the sonnet of Arvers,
Alfred de Musset, all those great geniuses who for that cause
have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like Jeanne d'Arc.
Hoping for your next letter soon, receive my kisses like those of
a brother.</blockquote>

Périgot (Joseph)."</div>
<p>We are attracted by every form of life which represents to us
something unknown and strange, by a last illusion still
unshattered. In spite of this, the mysterious utterances by means
of which M. de Charlus had led me to imagine the Princesse de
Guermantes as an extraordinary creature, different from anyone
that I knew, were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction
in which I was plunged, speedily followed by the fear that I
might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who
wanted to send me to the door of a house to which I had not been
invited, when, about two months after my dinner with the Duchess
and while she was at Cannes, having opened an envelope the
appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained
anything out of the common, I read the following words engraved
on a card: "The Princesse de Guermantes, <i>née</i> Duchesse en
Bavière, At Home, the &mdash;&mdash;th." No doubt to be invited
to the Princesse de Guermantes's was perhaps not, from the social
point of view, any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess,
and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title
of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides, I told myself
that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially
so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as M. de Charlus made
out, nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in
society. But my imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering
some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of
the laws of nature which he might quite well possess, depicted
for me not what I knew but what it saw; what it saw, that is to
say what the name shewed it. Now, even before I had met the
Duchess, the name Guermantes preceded by the title of Princess,
like a note or a colour or quantity, profoundly modified from the
surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that
governs it, had already suggested to me something entirely
different. With that title one finds one's thoughts straying
instinctively to the memoirs of the days of Louis XIII and Louis
XIV, the English Court, the Queen of Scots, the Duchesse
d'Aumale; and I imagined the town house of the Princesse de
Guermantes as more or less frequented by the Duchesse de
Longueville and the great Condé, whose presence there rendered it
highly improbable that I should ever make my way into it.</p>
<p>Many of the things that M. de Charlus had told me had driven a
vigorous spur into my imagination and, making it forget how much
the reality had disappointed me at Mme. de Guermantes's (people's
names are in this respect like the names of places), had swung it
towards Oriane's cousin. For that matter, M. de Charlus misled me
at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in
society only because he was himself at times misled. And this,
perhaps, because he did nothing, did not write, did not paint,
did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner. But,
superior by several degrees to the people in society, if it was
from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the
material for his conversation, he was not for that reason
understood by them. Speaking as an artist, he could at the most
reveal the fallacious charm of people in society. But reveal it
to artists alone, with relation to whom he might be said to play
the part played by the reindeer among the Esquimaux. This
precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and
mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise,
but which, once they have been digested by the reindeer, become
for the inhabitants of the far North a nourishing form of
food.</p>
<p>To which I may add that the pictures which M. de Charlus drew
of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his
ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections. Hatreds directed
mainly against the young men, adoration aroused principally by
certain women.</p>
<p>If among these the Princesse de Guermantes was placed by M. de
Charlus upon the most exalted throne, his mysterious words about
the 'unapproachable Aladdin's palace' in which his cousin dwelt
were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction. Apart from
whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view, of
which I shall have to speak later, in these artificial
magnifications, the fact remains that there is a certain
objective reality in each of these people, and consequently a
difference among them. And how, when it comes to that, could it
be otherwise? The humanity with which we consort and which bears
so little resemblance to our dreams is, for all that, the same
that, in the Memoirs, in the Letters of eminent persons, we have
seen described and have felt a desire to know. The old man of
complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who
wrote that proud letter, which (in a book on the War of 1870) we
read with emotion, to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a
dinner-table because our imagination is absent, and because it is
bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in
question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de
Pompadour, who was so valuable a patron of the arts, and we
should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern
Egerias, at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a
second call, so uninteresting do we find them. The fact remains,
nevertheless, that these differences do exist. People are never
exactly similar to one another, their mode of behaviour with
regard to ourselves, at, one might say, the same level of
friendship, reveals differences which, in the end, offer
compensations. When I knew Mme. de Montmorency, she loved to say
unpleasant things to me, but if I was in need of a service she
would squander, in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively,
all the credit at her disposal, without counting the cost.
Whereas some other woman, Mme. de Guermantes for example, would
never have wished to hurt my feelings, never said anything about
me except what might give me pleasure, showered on me all those
tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living,
morally, of the Guermantes, but, had I asked her for the least
thing above and beyond that, would not have moved an inch to
procure it for me, as in those country houses where one has at
one's disposal a motor-car and a special footman, but where it is
impossible to obtain a glass of cider, for which no provision has
been made in the arrangements for a party. Which was for me the
true friend, Mme. de Montmorency, so glad always to annoy me and
always so ready to oblige, or Mme. de Guermantes, distressed by
the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable
of the slightest effort to be of use to me? The types of the
human mind are so varied, so opposite, not only in literature but
in society, that Baudelaire and Mérimée are not the only people
who have the right to despise one another mutually. These
peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes,
of speech, of actions, so coherent, so despotic, that when we are
in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior
to the rest. With Mme. de Guermantes, her words, deduced like a
theorem from her type of mind, seemed to me the only ones that
could possibly be said. And I was, at heart, of her opinion when
she told me that Mme. de Montmorency was stupid and kept an open
mind towards all the things she did not understand, or when,
having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady, she said:
"That is what you call a good woman; it is what I call a
monster." But this tyranny of the reality which confronts us,
this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the
dawn&mdash;already distant&mdash;as pale as the faintest memory,
disappeared when I was away from Mme. de Guermantes, and a
different lady said to me, putting herself on my level and
reckoning the Duchess as placed far below either of us: "Oriane
takes no interest, really, in anything or anybody," or even (what
in the presence of Mme. de Guermantes it would have seemed
impossible to believe, so loudly did she herself proclaim the
opposite): "Oriane is a snob." Seeing that no mathematical
process would have enabled one to convert Mme. d'Arpajon and Mme.
de Montpensier into commensurable quantities, it would have been
impossible for me to reply, had anyone asked me which of the two
seemed to me superior to the other.</p>
<p>Now, among the peculiar characteristics of the drawing-room of
the Princesse de Guermantes, the one most generally quoted was a
certain exclusiveness, due in part to the royal birth of the
Princess, but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the
aristocratic prejudices of the Prince, prejudices which,
incidentally, the Duke and Duchess had made no scruple about
deriding in front of me, and which naturally were to make me
regard it as more improbable than ever that I should have been
invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and
dukes, and at every dinner-party made a scene because he had not
been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under
Louis XIV, a place which, thanks to his immense erudition in
matters of history and genealogy, he was the only person who
knew. For this reason, many of the people in society placed to
the credit of the Duke and Duchess the differences which
distinguished them from their cousins. "The Duke and Duchess are
far more modern, far more intelligent, they don't think of
nothing, like the other couple, but how many quarterings one has,
their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins',"
were customary remarks, the memory of which made me tremble as I
looked at the card of invitation, to which they gave a far
greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical
joker.</p>
<p>If the Duke and Duchess had not been still at Cannes, I might
have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which I
had received was genuine. This state of doubt in which I was
plunged was not due, as I flattered myself for a time by
supposing, to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have
felt and which, consequently, a writer, even if he belonged apart
from his writership to the fashionable caste, ought to reproduce
in order to be thoroughly 'objective' and to depict each class
differently. I happened, in fact, only the other day, in a
charming volume of memoirs, to come upon the record of
uncertainties analogous to those which the Princesse de
Guermantes's card made me undergo. "Georges and I" (or "Hély and
I," I have not the book at hand to verify the reference) "were so
keen to be asked to Mme. Delessert's that, having received an
invitation from her, we thought it prudent, each of us
independently, to make certain that we were not the victims of an
April fool." Now, the writer is none other than the Comte
d'Haussonville (he who married the Duc de Broglie's daughter) and
the other young man who 'independently' makes sure that he is not
having a practical joke played on him is, according to whether he
is called Georges or Hély, one or other of the two inseparable
friends of M. d'Haussonville, either M. d'Harcourt or the Prince
de Chalais.</p>
<p>The day on which the party was to be given at the Princesse de
Guermantes's, I learned that the Duke and Duchess had just
returned to Paris. The Princess's ball would not have brought
them back, but one of their cousins was seriously ill, and
moreover the Duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to
be held the same night, and at which he himself was to appear as
Louis XI and his wife as Isabel of Bavaria. And I determined to
go and see her that morning. But, having gone out early, they had
not yet returned; I watched first of all from a little room,
which had seemed to me to be a good look-out post, for the
arrival of their carriage. As a matter of fact I had made a
singularly bad choice in my observatory from which I could barely
make out our courtyard, but I did see into several others, and
this, though of no value to me, occupied my mind for a time. It
is not only in Venice that one has those outlooks on to several
houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters; it is
just the same in Paris. Nor do I cite Venice at random. It is of
its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of Paris make one
think, in the morning, with their tall, wide chimneys to which
the sun imparts the most vivid pinks, the brightest reds; it is a
whole garden that flowers above the houses, and flowers in such a
variety of tints that one would call it, planted on top of the
town, the garden of a tulip-fancier of Delft or Haarlem. And then
also, the extreme proximity of the houses, with their windows
looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard, makes of
each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down
at the ground below, in which farther off a girl is having her
hair combed by an old woman with the face, barely distinguishable
in the shadow, of a witch: thus each courtyard provides for the
adjoining house, by suppressing all sound in its interval, by
leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of
rectangular frames, glazed by the closing of the windows, an
exhibition of a hundred Dutch paintings hung in rows. Certainly
from the Hôtel de Guermantes one did not have the same kind of
view, but one had curious views also, especially from the strange
trigonometrical point at which I had placed myself and from which
one's gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant
heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which
preceded, on a steep slope, the mansion of the Marquise de
Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, cousins (of the most noble category)
of M. de Guermantes, whom I did not know. Between me and this
house (which was that of their father, M. de Bréquigny) nothing
but blocks of buildings of low elevation, facing in every
conceivable direction, which, without blocking the view,
increased the distance with their diagonal perspective. The
red-tiled turret of the coach-house in which the Marquis de
Frécourt kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose
rather higher, but was so slender that it concealed nothing, and
made one think of those picturesque old buildings in Switzerland
which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain. All these
vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more
distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by
several streets or by a series of foothills the house of Mme. de
Plassac, actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an
Alpine landscape. When its large paned windows, glittering in the
sunlight like flakes of rock crystal, were thrown open so as to
air the rooms, one felt, in following from one floor to the next
the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were
visibly shaking carpets, the same pleasure as when one sees in a
landscape by Turner or Elstir a traveller in a mail-coach, or a
guide, at different degrees of altitude on the Saint-Gothard. But
from this point of view in which I had ensconced myself I should
have been in danger of not seeing M. or Mme. de Guermantes come
in, so that when in the afternoon I was free to resume my survey
I simply stood on the staircase, from which the opening of the
carriage-gate could not escape my notice, and it was on this
staircase that I posted myself, albeit there did not appear
there, so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by
distance and busily cleaning, the Alpine beauties of the
Bréquigny-Tresmes mansion. Now this wait on the staircase was to
have for me consequences so considerable, and to reveal to me a
picture no longer Turneresque but ethical, of so great
importance, that it is preferable to postpone the account of it
for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the
Guermantes when I knew that they had come home. It was the Duke
alone who received me in the library. As I went in there came out
a little man with snow-white hair, a look of poverty, a little
black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at Combray and by
several of my grandfather's friends, but of a more timid aspect
than they, who, making me a series of profound bows, refused
absolutely to go downstairs until I had passed him. The Duke
shouted after him from the library something which I did not
understand, and the other responded with further bows, addressed
to the wall, for the Duke could not see him, but endlessly
repeated nevertheless, like the purposeless smiles on the faces
of people who are talking to one over the telephone; he had a
falsetto voice, and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man
of business. And he might, for that matter, have been a man of
business from Combray, so much was he in the style, provincial,
out of date and mild, of the small folk, the modest elders of
those parts. "You shall see Oriane in a minute," the Duke told me
when I had entered the room. "As Swann is coming in presently and
bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the Order
of Malta, and, what is worse, an immense photograph he has had
taken shewing both sides of each of the coins, Oriane preferred
to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it's
time to go out to dinner. We have such a heap of things in the
house already that we don't know where to put them all, and I ask
myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph. But
I have too good-natured a wife, who is too fond of giving people
pleasure. She thought it would be polite to ask Swann to let her
see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those Grand
Masters of the Order whose medals he has found at Rhodes. I said
Malta, didn't I, it is Rhodes, but it's all the same Order of
Saint John of Jerusalem. As a matter of fact, she is interested
in them only because Swann makes a hobby of it. Our family is
very much mixed up in the whole story; even at the present day,
my brother, whom you know, is one of the highest dignitaries in
the Order of Malta. But I might have told all that to Oriane, she
simply wouldn't have listened to me. On the other hand, it was
quite enough that Swann's researches into the Templars (it's
astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for
studying others) should have led him on to the history of the
Knights of Rhodes, who succeeded the Templars, for Oriane at once
to insist on seeing the heads of these Knights. They were very
small fry indeed compared with the Lusignans, Kings of Cyprus,
from whom we descend in a direct line. But so far, as Swann
hasn't taken them up, Oriane doesn't care to hear anything about
the Lusignans." I could not at once explain to the Duke why I had
come. What happened was that several relatives or friends,
including Mme. de Silistrie and the Duchesse de Montrose, came to
pay a call on the Duchess, who was often at home before dinner,
and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the Duke.
The first of these ladies (the Princesse de Silistrie), simply
attired, with a dry but friendly manner, carried a stick in her
hand. I was afraid at first that she had injured herself, or was
a cripple. She was on the contrary most alert. She spoke
regretfully to the Duke of a first cousin of his own&mdash;not on
the Guermantes side, but more illustrious still, were that
possible&mdash;whose health, which had been in a grave condition
for some time past, had grown suddenly worse. But it was evident
that the Duke, while full of pity for his cousin's lot, and
repeating "Poor Mama! He's such a good fellow!" had formed a
favourable prognosis. The fact was that the dinner at which the
Duke was to be present amused him, the big party at the Princesse
de Guermantes's did not bore him, but above all he was to go on
at one o'clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and
costume ball, with a view to which a costume of Louis XI for
himself, and one of Isabel of Bavaria for his wife were waiting
in readiness. And the Duke was determined not to be disturbed
amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy Amanien
d'Osmond. Two other ladies carrying sticks, Mme. de Plassac and
Mme. de Tresmes, both daughters of the Comte de Bréquigny, came
in next to pay Basin a visit, and declared that cousin Mama's
state left no room now for hope. The Duke shrugged his shoulders,
and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that
evening to Marie-Gilbert's. They replied that they were not, in
view of the state of Amanien who was in his last agony, and
indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the
Duke was going, the other guests at which they proceeded to
enumerate: the brother of King Theodosius, the Infanta Maria
Concepcion, and so forth. As the Marquis d'Osmond was less nearly
related to them than he was to Basin, their 'defection' appeared
to the Duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own
conduct. And so, albeit they had come down from the heights of
the Bréquigny mansion to see the Duchess (or rather to announce
to her the alarming character, incompatible for his relatives
with attendance at social gatherings, of their cousin's illness)
they did not stay long, and, each armed with her alpenstock,
Walpurge and Dorothée (such were the names of the two sisters)
retraced the craggy path to their citadel. I never thought of
asking the Guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks, so
common in a certain part of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Possibly,
looking upon the whole parish as their domain, and not caring to
hire cabs, they were in the habit of taking long walks, for which
some old fracture, due to immoderate indulgence in the chase, and
to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that
indulgence, or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the
left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary.
Perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition
through the quarter, but, having merely come down into their
garden (which lay at no distance from that of the Duchess) to
pick the fruit required for stewing, had looked in on their way
home to bid good evening to Mme. de Guermantes, though without
going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a watering-can into
her house. The Duke appeared touched that I should have come to
see them so soon after their return to Paris. But his face grew
dark when I told him that I had come to ask his wife to find out
whether her cousin really had invited me. I had touched upon one
of those services which M. and Mme. de Guermantes were not fond
of rendering. The Duke explained to me that it was too late, that
if the Princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him
appear to be asking her for one, that his cousins had refused him
one once before, and he had no wish to appear either directly or
indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list, be
'meddling'; finally, he could not even be sure that he and his
wife, who were dining out that evening, would not come straight
home afterwards, that in that case their best excuse for not
having gone to the Princess's party would be to conceal from her
the fact of their return to Paris, instead of hastening to inform
her of it, as they must do if they sent her a note, or spoke to
her over the telephone about me, and certainly too late to be of
any use, since, in all probability, the Princess's list of guests
would be closed by now. "You've not fallen foul of her in any
way?" he asked in a suspicious tone, the Guermantes living in a
constant fear of not being informed of the latest society
quarrels, and so of people's trying to climb back into favour on
their shoulders. Finally, as the Duke was in the habit of taking
upon himself all decisions that might seem not very good-natured:
"Listen, my boy," he said to me suddenly, as though the idea had
just come into his head, "I would really rather not mention at
all to Oriane that you have been speaking to me about it. You
know how kind-hearted she is; besides, she has an enormous regard
for you, she would insist on sending to ask her cousin, in spite
of anything I might say to the contrary, and if she is tired
after dinner, there will be no getting out of it, she will be
forced to go to the party. No, decidedly, I shall say nothing to
her about it. Anyhow, you will see her yourself in a minute. But
not a word about that matter, I beg of you. If you decide to go
to the party, I have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will
be to us to spend the evening there with you." The motives
actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are
invoked not to bow to them, whether he believes them to be
sincere or not; I did not wish to appear to be weighing in the
balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and
the possible tiredness of Mme. de Guermantes, and I promised not
to speak to her of the object of my visit, exactly as though I
had been taken in by the little farce which M. de Guermantes had
performed for my benefit. I asked him if he thought there was any
chance of my seeing Mme. de Stermaria at the Princess's. "Why,
no," he replied with the air of an expert; "I know the name you
mention, from having seen it in lists of club members, it is not
at all the type of person who goes to Gilbert's. You will see
nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring,
duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago
and which they have revived for the occasion, all the
Ambassadors, heaps of Coburgs, foreign royalties, but you mustn't
hope for the ghost of a Stermaria. Gilbert would be taken ill at
the mere thought of such a thing.</p>
<p>"Wait now, you're fond of painting, I must shew you a superb
picture I bought from my cousin, partly in exchange for the
Elstirs, which frankly did not appeal to us. It was sold to me as
a Philippe de Champaigne, but I believe myself that it's by some
one even greater. Would you like to know my idea? I believe it to
be a Velazquez, and of the best period," said the Duke, looking
me boldly in the eyes, whether to learn my impression or in the
hope of enhancing it. A footman came in. "Mme. la Duchesse has
told me to ask M. le Duc if M. le Duc will be so good as to see
M. Swann, as Mme. la Duchesse is not quite ready." "Shew M. Swann
in," said the Duke, after looking at his watch and seeing that he
had still a few minutes before he need go to dress. "Naturally my
wife, who told him to come, is not ready. There's no use saying
anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert's party," said the
Duke. "I don't know whether he's been invited. Gilbert likes him
immensely, because he believes him to be the natural grandson of
the Duc de Berri, but that's a long story. (Otherwise, you can
imagine! My cousin, who falls in a fit if he sees a Jew a mile
off.) But now, don't you see, the Dreyfus case has made things
more serious. Swann ought to have realised that he more than
anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows, instead of
which he says the most offensive things." The Duke called back
the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire
at cousin Osmond's had returned. His plan was as follows: as he
believed, and rightly, that his cousin was dying, he was anxious
to obtain news of him before his death, that is to say before he
was obliged to go into mourning. Once covered by the official
certainty that Amanien was still alive, he could go without a
thought to his dinner, to the Prince's party, to the midnight
revel at which he would appear as Louis XI, and had made the most
exciting assignation with a new mistress, and would make no more
inquiries until the following day, when his pleasures would be at
an end. Then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed
away in the night. "No, M. le Duc, he is not back yet." "What in
the Name of God! Nothing is ever done in this house till the last
minute," cried the Duke, at the thought that Amanien might still
be in time to 'croak' for an evening paper, and so make him miss
his revel. He sent for the <i>Temps</i>, in which there was
nothing. I had not seen Swann for a long time, and asked myself
at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache,
or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front, for I found
in him something altered; it was simply that he was indeed
greatly 'altered' because he was very ill, and illness produces
in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a
beard or by changing the line of one's parting. (Swann's illness
was the same that had killed his mother, who had been attacked by
it at precisely the age which he had now reached. Our existences
are in truth, owing to heredity, as full of cabalistic ciphers,
of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the
world. And just as there is a certain duration of life for
humanity in general, so there is one for families in particular,
that is to say, in any one family, for the members of it who
resemble one another.) Swann was dressed with an elegance which,
like that of his wife, associated with what he now was what he
once had been. Buttoned up in a pearl-grey frock-coat which
emphasised the tallness of his figure, slender, his white gloves
stitched in black, he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide
shape which Delion had ceased now to make except for him, the
Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Modène, M. Charles Haas and Comte
Louis de Turenne. I was surprised at the charming smile and
affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting, for
I had imagined that after so long an interval he would not
recognise me at once; I told him of my astonishment; he received
it with a shout of laughter, a trace of indignation and a further
grip of my hand, as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of
his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he
did not know me. And yet that was what had happened; he did not
identify me, as I learned long afterwards, until several minutes
later when he heard my name mentioned. But no change in his face,
in his speech, in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery
which a chance word from M. de Guermantes had enabled him to
make, with such mastery, with such absolute sureness did he play
the social game. He brought to it, moreover, that spontaneity in
manners and personal initiative, even in his style of dress,
which characterised the Guermantes type. Thus it was that the
greeting which the old clubman, without recognising me, had given
me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world
who was a pure formalist, but a greeting full of a real
friendliness, of a true charm, such as the Duchesse de
Guermantes, for instance, possessed (carrying it so far as to
smile at you first, before you had bowed to her, if she met you
in the street), in contrast to the more mechanical greeting
customary among the ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the
same way, again, the hat which, in conformity with a custom that
was beginning to disappear, he laid on the floor by his feet, was
lined with green leather, a thing not usually done, because,
according to him, this kept the hat much cleaner, in reality
because it was highly becoming. "Now, Charles, you're a great
expert, come and see what I've got to shew you, after which, my
boys, I'm going to ask your permission to leave you together for
a moment while I go and change my clothes, besides, I expect
Oriane won't be long now." And he shewed his 'Velazquez' to
Swann. "But it seems to me that I know this," said Swann with the
grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires
an effort. "Yes," said the Duke, turned serious by the time which
the expert took in expressing his admiration. "You have probably
seen it at Gilbert's." "Oh, yes, of course, I remember." "What do
you suppose it is?" "Oh, well, if it comes from Gilbert's, it is
probably one of your <i>ancestors</i>," said Swann with a blend
of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would
have felt it impolite and absurd to despise, but to which for
reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful
reference.</p>
<p>"To be sure, it is," said the Duke bluntly. "It's Boson, the I
forget how manieth de Guermantes. Not that I care a damn about
that. You know I'm not as feudal as my cousin. I've heard the
names mentioned of Rigaud, Mignard, Velazquez even!" he went on,
fastening on Swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in
an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his
response. "Well," he concluded, for when he was led to provoke
artificially an opinion which he desired to hear, he had the
faculty, after a few moments, of believing that it had been
spontaneously uttered; "come, now, none of your flattery, do you
think it's by one of those big masters I've mentioned?" "Nnnnno,"
said Swann. "But after all, I know nothing about these things,
it's not for me to decide who daubed the canvas. But you're a
dilettante, a master of the subject, to whom do you attribute it?
You're enough of an expert to have some idea. What would you put
it down as?" Swann hesitated for a moment before the picture,
which obviously he thought atrocious. "A bad joke!" he replied
with a smile at the Duke who could not check an impulsive
movement of rage. When this had subsided: "Be good fellows, both
of you, wait a moment for Oriane, I must go and put on my
swallow-tails and then I'll join you. I shall send word to my
good woman that you're both waiting for her." I talked for a
minute or two with Swann about the Dreyfus case, and asked him
how it was that all the Guermantes were anti-Dreyfusards. "In the
first place because at heart all these people are anti-Semites,"
replied Swann, who, all the same, knew very well from experience
that certain of them were not, but, like everyone who supports
any cause with ardour, preferred, to explain the fact that other
people did not share his opinion, to suppose in them a
preconceived reason, a prejudice against which there was nothing
to be done, rather than reasons which might permit of discussion.
Besides, having come to the premature term of his life, like a
weary animal that is goaded on, he cried out against these
persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his
fathers. "Yes, the Prince de Guermantes," I said, "it is true,
I've heard that he was anti-semitic." "Oh, that fellow! I wasn't
even thinking about him. He carries it to such a point that when
he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to
grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the
district, who happened to be a Jew, and later on he allowed a
wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the
ground, because he would have had to send for extinguishers to
the place next door, which belongs to the Rothschilds." "Are you
going to be there this evening, by any chance?" "Yes," Swann
replied, "although I am far too tired. But he sent me a wire to
tell me that he has something to say to me. I feel that I shall
be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at
home; it would upset me, so I prefer to get it over at once."
"But the Duc de Guermantes is not anti-semitic?" "You can see
quite well that he is, since he's an anti-Dreyfusard," replied
Swann, without noticing the logical fallacy. "That doesn't
prevent my being very sorry that I disappointed the
man&mdash;what am I saying? The Duke, I mean&mdash;by not
admiring his Mignard or whatever he calls it." "But at any rate,"
I went on, reverting to the Dreyfus case, "the Duchess, she, now,
is intelligent." "Yes, she is charming. To my mind, however, she
was even more charming when she was still known as the Princesse
des Laumes. Her mind has become somehow more angular, it was all
much softer in the juvenile great lady, but after all, young or
old, men or women, what can you expect, all these people belong
to a different race, one can't have a thousand years of feudalism
in one's blood with impunity. Naturally they imagine that it
counts for nothing in their opinions." "All the same, Robert de
Saint-Loup is a Dreyfusard." "Ah! So much the better, all the
more as you know that his mother is extremely 'and.' I had heard
that he was, but I wasn't certain of it. That gives me a great
deal of pleasure. It doesn't surprise me, he's highly
intelligent. It's a great thing, that is."</p>
<p>Dreyfusism had brought to Swann an extraordinary simplicity of
mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an
impulsiveness, an inconsistency more noticeable even than had
been the similar effects of his marriage to Odette; this new loss
of caste would have been better described as a recasting, and was
entirely to his credit, since it made him return to the ways in
which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned
aside to mix with the aristocracy. But Swann, just at the very
moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him, thanks
to the gifts he had inherited from his race, to perceive a truth
that was still hidden from people of fashion, shewed himself
nevertheless quite comically blind. He subjected afresh all his
admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion,
Dreyfusism. That the anti-Dreyfusism of Mme. Bontemps should have
made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that, when
he was first married, he should have thought her intelligent. It
was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his
political judgments and made him lose all memory of having
treated as a man with a price, a British spy (this latter was an
absurdity of the Guermantes set), Clemenceau, whom he declared
now to have always stood up for conscience, to be a man of iron,
like Comely. "No, no, I never told you anything of the sort.
You're thinking of some one else." But, sweeping past his
political judgments, the wave overthrew in Swann his literary
judgments also, and even affected his way of pronouncing them.
Barrés had lost all his talent, and even the books of his early
days were feeble, one could hardly read them again. "You try,
you'll find you can't struggle to the end. What a difference from
Clemenceau! Personally, I am not anticlerical, but when you
compare them together you must see that Barrés is invertebrate.
He's a very great fellow, is old Clemenceau. How he knows the
language!" However, the anti-Dreyfusards were in no position to
criticise these follies. They explained that one was a Dreyfusard
by one's being of Jewish origin. If a practising Catholic like
Saniette stood out also for a fresh trial, that was because he
was buttonholed by Mme. Verdurin, who behaved like a wild
Radical. She was out above all things against the 'frocks.'
Saniette was more fool than knave, and had no idea of the harm
that the Mistress was doing him. If you pointed out that Brichot
was equally a friend of Mme. Verdurin and was a member of the
Patrie Française, that was because he was more intelligent. "You
see him occasionally?" I asked Swann, referring to Saint-Loup.
"No, never. He wrote to me the other day hoping that I would ask
the Duc de Mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the
Jockey, where for that matter he got through like a letter
through the post." "In spite of the Case!" "The question was
never raised. However I must tell you that since all this
business began I never set foot in the place."</p>
<p>M. de Guermantes returned, and was presently joined by his
wife, all ready now for the evening, tall and proud in a gown of
red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles. She had
in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple, and over her
shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress. "How nice
it is to have one's hat lined with leather," said the Duchess,
whom nothing escaped. "However, with you, Charles, everything is
always charming, whether it's what you wear or what you say what
you read or what you do." Swann meanwhile, without apparently
listening, was considering the Duchess as he would have studied
the canvas of a master, and then sought her gaze, making with his
lips the grimace which implies: 'The devil!' Mme. de Guermantes
rippled with laughter. "So my clothes please you? I'm delighted.
But I must say that they don't please me much," she went on with
a sulking air. "Good Lord, what a bore it is to have to dress up
and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home!"
"What magnificent rubies!" "Ah! my dear Charles, at least one can
see that you know what you're talking about, you're not like that
brute Monserfeuil who asked me if they were real. I must say that
I've never seen anything quite like them. They were a present
from the Grand Duchess. They're a little too large for my liking,
a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim, but I've put
them on because we shall be seeing the Grand Duchess this evening
at Marie-Gilbert's," added Mme. de Guermantes, never suspecting
that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made
by the Duke. "What's on at the Princess's?" inquired Swann.
"Practically nothing," the Duke hastened to reply, the question
having made him think that Swann was not invited. "What's that,
Basin? When all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured? It
will be a deathly crush. What will be pretty, though," she went
on, looking wistfully at Swann, "if the storm I can feel in the
air now doesn't break, will be those marvellous gardens. You know
them, of course. I was there a month ago, at the time when the
lilacs were in flower, you can't have any idea how lovely they
were. And then the fountain, really, it's Versailles in Paris."
"What sort of person is the Princess?" I asked. "Why, you know
quite well, you've seen her here, she's as beautiful as the day,
also rather an idiot. Very nice, in spite of all her Germanic
high-and-mightiness, full of good nature and stupid mistakes."
Swann was too subtle not to perceive that the Duchess, in this
speech, was trying to shew the 'Guermantes wit,' and at no great
cost to herself, for she was only serving up in a less perfect
form an old saying of her own. Nevertheless, to prove to the
Duchess that he appreciated her intention to be, and as though
she had really succeeded in being, funny, he smiled with a
slightly forced air, causing me by this particular form of
insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb
me long ago when I heard my parents discussing with M. Vinteuil
the corruption of certain sections of society (when they knew
very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at
Montjouvain), Legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit
of fools, choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well
would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public.
"Come now, Oriane, what on earth are you saying?" broke in M. de
Guermantes. "Marie a fool? Why, she has read everything, she's as
musical as a fiddle." "But, my poor little Basin, you're as
innocent as a new-born babe. As if one could not be all that, and
rather an idiot as well. Idiot is too strong a word; no, she's in
the clouds, she's Hesse-Darmstadt, Holy Roman Empire, and
wa-wa-wa. Her pronunciation alone makes me tired. But I quite
admit that she's a charming loony. Simply the idea of stepping
down from her German throne to go and marry, in the most
middle-class way, a private citizen. It is true that she chose
him! Yes, it's quite true," she went on, turning to me, "you
don't know Gilbert. Let me give you an idea of him, he took to
his bed once because I had left a card on Mme.
Carnot.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. But, my little
Charles," said the Duchess, changing the conversation when she
saw that the story of the card left on the Carnots appeared to
irritate M. de Guermantes, "you know, you've never sent me that
photograph of our Knights of Rhodes, whom I've learned to love
through you, and I am so anxious to make their acquaintance." The
Duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife's face.
"Oriane, you might at least tell the story properly and not cut
out half. I ought to explain," he corrected, addressing Swann,
"that the British Ambassadress at that time, who was a very
worthy woman, but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit
of making up these odd combinations, conceived the distinctly
quaint idea of inviting us with the President and his wife. We
were&mdash;Oriane herself was rather surprised, especially as the
Ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to
invite us, of all things, to so ill-assorted a gathering. There
was a Minister there who is a swindler, however I pass over all
that, we had not been warned in time, were caught in the trap,
and, I'm bound to admit, all these people behaved most civilly to
us. Only, once was enough. Mme. de Guermantes, who does not often
do me the honour of consulting me, felt it incumbent upon her to
leave a card in the course of the following week at the Elysée.
Gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a
stain upon our name. But it must not be forgotten that, politics
apart, M. Carnot, who for that matter filled his post quite
adequately, was the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary
Tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a
single day." "In that case, Basin, why did you go every week to
dine at Chantilly? The Duc d'Aumale was just as much the grandson
of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, with this difference,
that Carnot was a brave man and Philippe Egalité a wretched
scoundrel." "Excuse my interrupting you to explain that I did
send the photograph," said Swann. "I can't understand how it
hasn't reached you." "It doesn't altogether surprise me," said
the Duchess, "my servants tell me only what they think fit. They
probably do not approve of the Order of Saint John." And she rang
the bell. "You, know, Oriane, that when I used to go to Chantilly
it was without enthusiasm." "Without enthusiasm, but with a
nightshirt in a bag, in case the Prince asked you to stay, which
for that matter he very rarely did, being a perfect cad like all
the Orléans lot. Do you know who else are to be dining at Mme. de
Saint-Euverte's?" Mme. de Guermantes asked her husband. "Besides
the people you know already, she's asked at the last moment King
Theodosius's brother." At these tidings the Duchess's features
breathed contentment and her speech boredom. "Oh, good heavens,
more princes!" "But that one is well-mannered and intelligent,"
Swann suggested. "Not altogether, though," replied the Duchess,
apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the
thought expressed. "Have you ever noticed with princes that the
best-mannered among them are not really well-mannered? They must
always have an opinion about everything. Then, as they have none
of their own, they spend the first half of their lives asking us
ours and the other half serving it up to us second-hand. They
positively must be able to say that one piece has been well
played and the next not so well. When there is no difference.
Listen, this little Theodosius junior (I forget his name) asked
me what one called an orchestral motif. I replied," said the
Duchess, her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her
beautiful red lips: "'One calls it an orchestral motif.' I don't
think he was any too well pleased, really. Oh, my dear Charles,"
she went on, "what a bore it can be, dining out. There are
evenings when one would sooner die! It is true that dying may be
perhaps just as great a bore, because we don't know what it's
like." A servant appeared. It was the young lover who used to
have trouble with the porter, until the Duchess, in her kindness
of heart, brought about an apparent peace between them. "Am I to
go up this evening to inquire for M. le Marquis d'Osmond?" he
asked. "Most certainly not, nothing before to-morrow morning. In
fact I don't want you to remain in the house to-night. The only
thing that will happen will be that his footman, who knows you,
will come to you with the latest report and send you out after
us. Get off, go anywhere you like, have a woman, sleep out, but I
don't want to see you here before to-morrow morning." An immense
joy overflowed from the footman's face. He would at last be able
to spend long hours with his ladylove, whom he had practically
ceased to see ever since, after a final scene with the porter,
the Duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be
better, to avoid further conflicts, if he did not go out at all.
He floated, at the thought of having an evening free at last, in
a happiness which the Duchess saw and guessed its reason. She
felt, so to speak, a tightening of the heart and an itching in
all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous
couple were snatching behind her back, concealing themselves from
her, which left her irritated and jealous. "No, Basin, let him
stay here; I say, he's not to stir out of the house." "But,
Oriane, that's absurd, the house is crammed with servants, and
you have the costumier's people coming as well at twelve to dress
us for this show. There's absolutely nothing for him to do, and
he's the only one who's a friend of Mama's footman; I would a
thousand times rather get him right away from the house."
"Listen, Basin, let me do what I want, I shall have a message for
him to take in the evening, as it happens, I can't tell yet at
what time. In any case you're not to go out of the house for a
single instant, do you hear?" she said to the despairing footman.
If there were continual quarrels, and if servants did not stay
long with the Duchess, the person to whose charge this guerrilla
warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable, but it was not the
porter; no doubt for the rougher tasks, for the martyrdoms that
it was more tiring to inflict, for the quarrels which ended in
blows, the Duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him; but
even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he
had been cast for it. Like the household servants, he admired the
Duchess for her kindness of heart; and footmen of little
discernment who came back, after leaving her service, to visit
Françoise used to say that the Duke's house would have been the
finest 'place' in Paris if it had not been for the porter's
lodge. The Duchess 'played' the lodge on them, just as at
different times clericalism, freemasonry, the Jewish peril have
been played on the public. Another footman came into the room.
"Why have not they brought up the package that M. Swann sent
here? And, by the way (you've heard, Charles, that Mama is
seriously ill?), Jules went up to inquire for news of M. le
Marquis d'Osmond: has he come back yet?" "He's just come this
instant, M. le Duc. They're waiting from one moment to the next
for M. le Marquis to pass away." "Ah! He's alive!" exclaimed the
Duke with a sigh of relief. "That's all right, that's all right:
sold again, Satan! While there's life there's hope," the Duke
announced to us with a joyful air. "They've been talking about
him as though he were dead and buried. In a week from now he'll
be fitter than I am." "It's the Doctors who said that he wouldn't
last out the evening. One of them wanted to call again during the
night. The head one said it was no use. M. le Marquis would be
dead by then; they've only kept him alive by injecting him with
camphorated oil." "Hold your tongue, you damned fool," cried the
Duke in a paroxysm of rage. "Who the devil asked you to say all
that? You haven't understood a word of what they told you." "It
wasn't me they told, it was Jules." "Will you hold your tongue!"
roared the Duke, and, turning to Swann, "What a blessing he's
still alive! He will regain his strength gradually, don't you
know. Still alive, after being in such a critical state, that in
itself is an excellent sign. One mustn't expect everything at
once. It can't be at all unpleasant, a little injection of
camphorated oil." He rubbed his hands. "He's alive; what more
could anyone want? After going through all that he's gone
through, it's a great step forward. Upon my word, I envy him
having such a temperament. Ah! these invalids, you know, people
do all sorts of little things for them that they don't do for us.
Now to-day there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of
mutton with <i>béarnaise</i> sauce&mdash;it was done to a turn, I
must admit, but just for that very reason I took so much of it
that it's still lying on my stomach. However, that doesn't make
people come to inquire for me as they do for dear Amanien. We do
too much inquiring. It only tires him. We must let him have room
to breathe. They're killing the poor fellow by sending round to
him all the time." "Well," said the Duchess to the footman as he
was leaving the room, "I gave orders for the envelope containing
a photograph which M. Swann sent me to be brought up here."
"Madame la Duchesse, it is so large that I didn't know if I could
get it through the door. We have left it in the hall. Does Madame
la Duchesse wish me to bring it up?" "Oh, in that case, no; they
ought to have told me, but if it's so big I shall see it in a
moment when I come downstairs." "I forgot to tell Mme. la
Duchesse that Mme. la Comtesse Molé left a card this morning for
Mme. la Duchesse." "What, this morning?" said the Duchess with an
air of disapproval, feeling that so young a woman ought not to
take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning. "About ten
o'clock, Madame la Duchesse." "Shew me the cards." "In any case,
Oriane, when you say that it was a funny idea on Marie's part to
marry Gilbert," went on the Duke, reverting to the original topic
of conversation, "it is you who have an odd way of writing
history. If either of them was a fool, it was Gilbert, for having
married of all people a woman so closely related to the King of
the Belgians, who has usurped the name of Brabant which belongs
to us. To put it briefly, we are of the same blood as the Hesses,
and of the elder branch. It is always stupid to talk about
oneself," he apologised to me, "but after all, whenever we have
been not only at Darmstadt, but even at Cassel and all over
Electoral Hesse, the Landgraves have always, all of them, been
most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder
branch." "But really, Basin, you don't mean to tell me that a
person who was a Major in every regiment in her country, who had
been engaged to the King of Sweden .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."
"Oriane, that is too much; anyone would think that you didn't
know that the King of Sweden's grandfather was tilling the soil
at Pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years
throughout the whole of Europe." "That doesn't alter the fact
that if somebody were to say in the street: 'Hallo, there's the
King of Sweden,' everyone would at once rush to see him as far as
the Place de la Concorde, and if he said: 'There's M. de
Guermantes,' nobody would know who M. de Guermantes was." "What
an argument!" "Besides, I never can understand how, once the
title of Duke of Brabant has passed to the Belgian Royal Family,
you can continue to claim it."</p>
<p>The footman returned with the Comtesse Molé's card, or rather
what she had left in place of a card. Alleging that she had none
on her, she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to
herself, and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope
which bore the inscription: 'La Comtesse Molé.' As the envelope
was rather large, following the fashion in notepaper which
prevailed that year, this manuscript 'card' was almost twice the
size of an ordinary visiting card. "That is what people call Mme.
Molé's 'simplicity,'" said the Duchess ironically. "She wants to
make us think that she had no cards on her, and to shew her
originality. But we know all about that, don't we, my little
Charles, we are quite old enough and quite original enough
ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only
been going about for four years. She is charming, but she doesn't
seem to me, all the same, to be quite 'big' enough to imagine
that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as
merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at
ten o'clock in the morning. Her old mother mouse will shew her
that she knows a thing or two about that." Swann could not help
smiling at the thought that the Duchess, who was, incidentally, a
trifle jealous of Mme. Molé's success, would find it quite in
accordance with the 'Guermantes wit' to make some impertinent
retort to her visitor. "So far as the title of Duc de Brabant is
concerned, I've told you a hundred times,
Oriane.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." the Duke continued, but the
Duchess, without listening, cut him short. "But, my little
Charles, I'm longing to see your photograph." "Ah! <i>Extinctor
draconis latrator Anubis</i>," said Swann. "Yes, it was so
charming what you said about that when you were comparing the
Saint George at Venice. But I don't understand: why Anubis?"
"What's the one like who was an ancestor of Babal?" asked M. de
Guermantes. "You want to see his bauble?" retorted his wife,
dryly, to shew she herself scorned the pun. "I want to see them
all," she added. "Listen, Charles, let us wait downstairs till
the carriage comes," said the Duke; "you can pay your call on us
in the hall, because my wife won't let us have any peace until
she's seen your photograph. I am less impatient, I must say," he
added with a satisfied air. "I am not easily moved myself, but
she would see us all dead rather than miss it." "I am entirely of
your opinion, Basin," said the Duchess, "let us go into the hall;
we shall at least know why we have come down from your study,
while we shall never know how we have come down from the Counts
of Brabant." "I've told you a hundred times how the title came
into the House of Hesse," said the Duke (while we were going
downstairs to look at the photograph, and I thought of those that
Swann used to bring me at Combray), "through the marriage of a
Brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last Landgrave of
Thuringia and Hesse, so that really it is the title of Prince of
Hesse that came to the House of Brabant rather than that of Duke
of Brabant to the House of Hesse. You will remember that our
battle-cry was that of the Dukes of Brabant: 'Limbourg to her
conqueror!' until we exchanged the arms of Brabant for those of
Guermantes, in which I think myself that we were wrong, and the
example of the Gramonts will not make me change my opinion."
"But," replied Mme. de Guermantes, "as it is the King of the
Belgians who is the conqueror.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Besides
the Belgian Crown Prince calls himself Duc de Brabant." "But, my
dear child, your argument will not hold water for a moment. You
know as well as I do that there are titles of pretension which
can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by
usurpers. For instance, the King of Spain describes himself
equally as Duke of Brabant, claiming in virtue of a possession
less ancient than ours, but more ancient than that of the King of
the Belgians. He calls himself also Duke of Burgundy, King of the
Indies Occidental and Oriental, and Duke of Milan. Well, he is no
more in possession of Burgundy, the Indies or Brabant than I
possess Brabant myself, or the Prince of Hesse either, for that
matter. The King of Spain likewise proclaims himself King of
Jerusalem, as does the Austrian Emperor, and Jerusalem belongs to
neither one nor the other." He stopped for a moment with an
awkward feeling that the mention of Jerusalem might have
embarrassed Swann, in view of 'current events,' but only went on
more rapidly: "What you said just now might be said of anyone. We
were at one time Dukes of Aumale, a duchy that has passed as
regularly to the House of France as Joinville and Chevreuse have
to the House of Albert. We make no more claim to those titles
than to that of Marquis de Noirmoutiers, which was at one time
ours, and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the House of
La Trémoïlle, but because certain cessions are valid, it does not
follow that they all are. For instance," he went on, turning to
me, "my sister-in-law's son bears the title of Prince
d'Agrigente, which comes to us from Joan the Mad, as that of
Prince de Tarente comes to the La Trémoïlles. Well, Napoleon went
and gave this title of Tarente to a soldier, who may have been
admirable in the ranks, but in doing so the Emperor was disposing
of what belonged to him even less than Napoleon III when he
created a Duc de Montmorency, since Périgord had at least a
mother who was a Montmorency, while the Tarente of Napoleon I had
no more Tarente about him than Napoleon's wish that he should
become so. That did not prevent Chaix d'Est-Ange, alluding to our
uncle Condé, from asking the Procurer Impérial if he had picked
up the title of Duc de Montmorency in the moat of Vincennes."</p>
<p>"Listen, Basin, I ask for nothing better than to follow you to
the ditches of Vincennes, or even to Taranto. And that reminds
me, Charles, of what I was going to say to you when you were
telling me about your Saint George at Venice. We have an idea,
Basin and I, of spending next spring in Italy and Sicily. If you
were to come with us, just think what a difference it would make!
I'm not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you, but imagine,
after all you've told me so often about the remains of the Norman
Conquest and of ancient history, imagine what a trip like that
would become if you came with us! I mean to say that even
Basin&mdash;what am I saying, Gilbert&mdash;would benefit by it,
because I feel that even his claims to the throne of Naples and
all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained
by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on
hills like primitive paintings. But now we're going to look at
your photograph. Open the envelope," said the Duchess to a
footman. "Please, Oriane, not this evening; you can look at it
to-morrow," implored the Duke, who had already been making signs
of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph. "But I
like to look at it with Charles," said the Duchess, with a smile
at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle, for
in her desire to be friendly to Swann she spoke of the pleasure
which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it
were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an
orange, or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with
her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of
her favourite pursuits. "All right, he will come again to see
you, on purpose," declared the Duke, to whom his wife was obliged
to yield. "You can spend three hours in front of it, if that
amuses you," he added ironically. "But where are you going to
stick a toy of those dimensions?" "Why, in my room, of course. I
like to have it before my eyes." "Oh, just as you please; if it's
in your room, probably I shall never see it," said the Duke,
without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of
the negative character of his conjugal relations. "Very well, you
will undo it with the greatest care," Mme. de Guermantes told the
servant, multiplying her instructions out of politeness to Swann.
"And see that you don't crumple the envelope, either." "So even
the envelope has got to be respected!" the Duke murmured to me,
raising his eyes to the ceiling. "But, Swann," he added, "I, who
am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic, what I wonder
at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size.
Where did you pick it up?" "Oh, at the photographer's; they're
always sending out things like that. But the man is a fool, for I
see he's written on it 'The Duchesse de Guermantes,' without
putting 'Madame.'" "I'll forgive him for that," said the Duchess
carelessly; then, seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which
enlivened her, checked a faint smile; but at once returning to
Swann: "Well, you don't say whether you're coming to Italy with
us?" "Madame, I am really afraid that it will not be possible."
"Indeed! Mme. de Montmorency is more fortunate. You went with her
to Venice and Vicenza. She told me that with you one saw things
one would never see otherwise, things no one had ever thought of
mentioning before, that you shewed her things she had never
dreamed of, and that even in the well-known things she had been
able to appreciate details which without you she might have
passed by a dozen times without ever noticing. Obviously, she has
been more highly favoured than we are to
be.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. You will take the big
envelope from M. Swann's photograph," she said to the servant,
"and you will hand it in, from me, this evening at half past ten
at Mme. la Comtesse Molé's." Swann laughed. "I should like to
know, all the same," Mme. de Guermantes asked him, "how, ten
months before the time, you can tell that a thing will be
impossible." "My dear Duchess, I will tell you if you insist upon
it, but, first of all, you can see that I am very ill." "Yes, my
little Charles, I don't think you look at all well. I'm not
pleased with your colour, but I'm not asking you to come with me
next week, I ask you to come in ten months. In ten months one has
time to get oneself cured, you know." At this point a footman
came in to say that the carriage was at the door. "Come, Oriane,
to horse," said the Duke, already pawing the ground with
impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood
waiting outside. "Very well, give me in one word the reason why
you can't come to Italy," the Duchess put it to Swann as she rose
to say good-bye to us. "But, my dear friend, it's because I shall
then have been dead for several months. According to the doctors
I consulted last winter, the thing I've got&mdash;which may, for
that matter, carry me off at any moment&mdash;won't in any case
leave me more than three or four months to live, and even that is
a generous estimate," replied Swann with a smile, while the
footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the Duchess
out. "What's that you say?" cried the Duchess, stopping for a
moment on her way to the carriage, and raising her fine eyes,
their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty. Placed for the
first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as
getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity
for a man who was about to die, she could find nothing in the
code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow, and,
not knowing which to choose, felt it better to make a show of not
believing that the latter alternative need be seriously
considered, so as to follow the first, which demanded of her at
the moment less effort, and thought that the best way of settling
the conflict would be to deny that any existed. "You're joking,"
she said to Swann. "It would be a joke in charming taste,"
replied he ironically. "I don't know why I am telling you this; I
have never said a word to you before about my illness. But as you
asked me, and as now I may die at any
moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. But whatever I do I mustn't
make you late; you're dining out, remember," he added, because he
knew that for other people their own social obligations took
precedence of the death of a friend, and could put himself in her
place by dint of his instinctive politeness. But that of the
Duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the
dinner to which she was going must count for less to Swann than
his own death. And so, while continuing on her way towards the
carriage, she let her shoulders droop, saying: "Don't worry about
our dinner. It's not of any importance!" But this put the Duke in
a bad humour, who exclaimed: "Come, Oriane, don't stop there
chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with Swann;
you know very well that Mme. de Saint-Euverte insists on sitting
down to table at eight o'clock sharp. We must know what you
propose to do; the horses have been waiting for a good five
minutes. I beg your pardon, Charles," he went on, turning to
Swann, "but it's ten minutes to eight already. Oriane is always
late, and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old
Saint-Euverte's."</p>
<p>Mme. de Guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage
and uttered a last farewell to Swann. "You know, we can talk
about that another time; I don't believe a word you've been
saying, but we must discuss it quietly. I expect they gave you a
dreadful fright, come to luncheon, whatever day you like" (with
Mme. de Guermantes things always resolved themselves into
luncheons), "you will let me know your day and time," and,
lifting her red skirt, she set her foot on the step. She was just
getting into the carriage when, seeing this foot exposed, the
Duke cried in a terrifying voice: "Oriane, what have you been
thinking of, you wretch? You've kept on your black shoes! With a
red dress! Go upstairs quick and put on red shoes, or rather," he
said to the footman, "tell the lady's maid at once to bring down
a pair of red shoes." "But, my dear," replied the Duchess gently,
annoyed to see that Swann, who was leaving the house with me but
had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us,
could hear, "since we are late." "No, no, we have plenty of time.
It is only ten to; it won't take us ten minutes to get to the
Parc Monceau. And, after all, what would it matter? If we turned
up at half past eight they'd have to wait for us, but you can't
possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes. Besides, we
shan't be the last, I can tell you; the Sassenages are coming,
and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine." The
Duchess went up to her room. "Well," said M. de Guermantes to
Swann and myself, "we poor, down-trodden husbands, people laugh
at us, but we are of some use all the same. But for me, Oriane
would have been going out to dinner in black shoes." "It's not
unbecoming," said Swann, "I noticed the black shoes and they
didn't offend me in the least." "I don't say you're wrong,"
replied the Duke, "but it looks better to have them to match the
dress. Besides, you needn't worry, she would no sooner have got
there than she'd have noticed them, and I should have been
obliged to come home and fetch the others. I should have had my
dinner at nine o'clock. Good-bye, my children," he said,
thrusting us gently from the door, "get away, before Oriane comes
down again. It's not that she doesn't like seeing you both. On
the contrary, she's too fond of your company. If she finds you
still here she will start talking again, she is tired out
already, she'll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I
tell you frankly, I'm dying of hunger. I had a wretched luncheon
this morning when I came from the train. There was the devil of a
<i>béarnaise</i> sauce, I admit, but in spite of that I shan't be
at all sorry, not at all sorry to sit down to dinner. Five
minutes to eight! Oh, women, women! She'll give us both
indigestion before to-morrow. She is not nearly as strong as
people think." The Duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of
his wife's ailments and his own to a dying man, for the former
interested him more, appeared to him more important. And so it
was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that, after
politely shewing us out, he cried 'from off stage,' in a
stentorian voice from the porch to Swann, who was already in the
courtyard: "You, now, don't let yourself be taken in by the
doctors' nonsense, damn them. They're donkeys. You're as strong
as the Pont Neuf. You'll live to bury us all!"</p>
