<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TINY CARTERET stretched out a hand like a leg of
mutton and picked up the marmalade. On the sideboard what remained
of the kidneys and bacon still sizzled cheerfully on the hot plate:
by his side a cup of dimensions suitable for a baby's bath gave
forth the fragrant smell of coffee. In short, Tiny Carteret,
half-way through his breakfast.</p>

<p>The window was wide open, and from the distance came the
ceaseless roar of the traffic in Piccadilly. In the street just
below, a gentleman of powerful but unmelodious voice was
proclaiming the merits of his strawberries: whilst from the
half-way mark came the ghastly sound of a cornet solo. In short, a
service flat in Curzon Street.</p>

<p>The marmalade stage with Tiny was always the letter-opening
stage, and as usual, he ran through the pile in front of him before
beginning to read any of them. A couple of obvious bills: three
more in feminine hands which proclaimed invitations of sorts with
the utmost certainty&mdash;and then one over which he paused. The
writing was a man's: moreover, it was one which he knew well
although it was many months since he had seen it. Neat: decisive:
strong&mdash;it gave the character of the writer with absolute
accuracy.</p>

<p>"Ronald, by Jove!" muttered Tiny to himself. "And a Swiss
postmark. Now what the dickens is the old lad doing there?"</p>

<p>He slit open the envelope, propped the letter against the
coffee-pot, and began to read.</p>

<p class="letter">MY DEAR TINY [it ran]&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">I know that at this time of year Ranelagh and
Lords form your happy hunting-grounds, as a general rule by day,
whilst at night you are in the habit of treading on unfortunate
women's feet in divers ballrooms. Nevertheless, should you care to
strike out on a new line, I think I can promise you quite a bit of
fun out here. At least when I say here, this will be our
starting-point. Where the trail may lead to, Allah alone knows.
Seriously, Tiny, I have need of you. There is not going to be any
poodle faking about it: in fact, the proposition is going to be an
extremely tough one. So don't let's start under false pretences.
There is going to be the devil of a lot of danger in it, and I want
someone with a steady nerve, who can use a revolver if necessary,
who has a bit of weight behind his fists and knows how to use
'em.</p>

<p class="letter">If the sound of this appeals to you send me a
wire at once, and I will await your arrival here.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours ever, RONALD STANDISH.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;A good train leaves the Gare de Lyons
at 9.10 p.m. Gives you plenty of time for dinner in Paris.</p>

<p>Tiny pulled out his case and thoughtfully lit a cigarette. A
faint twinkle in his eyes showed that he appreciated the full
significance of the postscript: Ronald Standish knew what his
answer would be as well as he did himself. Even as the trout rises
to the may-fly, so do the Tiny Carterets of this world rise to bait
such as was contained in the body of the letter. And just because
he knew he was going to swallow it whole, he played with it
mentally for quite a time. He even went through the farcical
performance of consulting his engagement book. For the next month
he had not got a free evening&mdash;a thing he had been fully aware
of long before he opened the book. In addition, such trifles as
Ascot and Wimbledon loomed large during the daylight hours. In
fact, he reflected, as he uncoiled his large bulk from the chair,
the number of lies he would have to tell in the near future would
probably fuse the telephone.</p>

<p>And at this period it might be well to give some slight
description of him. The nickname Tiny was of course an obvious one
to give a man who had been capped fifteen times for England playing
in the scrum. But though he was extraordinarily bigly made, he was
at the same time marvellously agile, as men who played him at
squash found to their cost. He could run a much lighter man off his
feet, without turning a hair himself. The last half of the war had
found him in the Coldstream: then, bored with peace-time soldiering
he had sent in his papers and taken to sport of every description,
which, fortunately for him, the possession of five thousand a year
enabled him to do with some ease.</p>

<p>That he was extremely popular with both men and women was not to
be wondered at: he was so completely free from side of any sort. In
fact, many a net had been spread in the sight of the wary old bird
by girls who would have had no objection to becoming Mrs. Tiny. But
so far beyond flirting outrageously with all and sundry he had
refused to be caught, and now at the age of thirty he was still as
far from settling down as ever.</p>

<p>Once again he glanced at Standish's letter. It had been sent
from the Grand Hotel at Territet, a spot which he recalled as being
on the Lake of Geneva. And once again he asked himself the same
question&mdash;what on earth was Ronald Standish doing there of all
places? Territet was associated in his mind with tourists and
pretty little white steamers on the lake. Also years ago he had
played in a tennis tournament there. But Ronald was a different
matter altogether.</p>

<p>It had been said of Standish that only the Almighty and he
himself knew what his job was, and that it was doubtful which of
the two it would be the more difficult to find out from. If asked
point blank he would stare at the speaker with a pair of innocent
blue eyes and remark vaguely&mdash;"Damned if I know, old boy." For
months on end he would remain in London leading the ordinary life
of a man of means, then suddenly he would disappear at a moment's
notice, only to reappear just as unexpectedly. And any inquiries as
to where he had been would probably elucidate the illuminating
answer that he had just been pottering round. But it was to be
noticed that after these periodical disappearances his morning walk
for a few days generally led towards that part of Whitehall where
Secretaries of State live and move and have their being. It might
also be noticed&mdash;if there was anyone there to see&mdash;that
when Ronald Standish sent in his name he was not kept waiting.</p>

<p>Even with Tiny Carteret he had never been communicative, though
they were members of the same clubs and the closest of friends. The
farthest he had ever gone was to murmur vaguely something about
intelligence. And it was significant that at the time of the Arcos
raid the first question he had asked <i>before</i> opening the
paper which contained the news, was the number of men who had been
rounded up. Significant also that on two occasions after he had
returned from these strange trips of his he had been absent from
London for a day, once at Windsor and the other time at
Sandringham.</p>

<p>At the moment he had been away for about a month. He had
disappeared in his usual unexpected manner, leaving a Free Forester
team one man short as a result. Which in itself was sufficient to
show that the matter was important, for cricket was a mania with
him. And yet Territet of all places! Tiny Carteret scratched his
head and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving London, Murdoch," he said, when his valet appeared.
"I'm going to Switzerland."</p>

<p>"Switzerland, sir?" The man looked at him as if he had taken
leave of his senses. "At this time of year?"</p>

<p>"Even so, Murdoch," answered Tiny with a grin. "But I shan't
want you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. And when will you be leaving?"</p>

<p>At that moment the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"See who it is, Murdoch. And then find out if I'm in."</p>

<p>The valet picked up the receiver, and Tiny heard a man's voice
coming over the wire.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. This is Mr. Carteret's flat. I will see if he is
in."</p>

<p>He covered the mouthpiece with his hand and turned to his
master.</p>

<p>"A Colonel Gillson, sir, wishes to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Gillson," muttered Tiny. "Who the devil is Gillson?"</p>

<p>He took the receiver from Murdoch.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Carteret speaking."</p>

<p>"Good morning." The voice was deep and pleasant. "I am Gillson.
Speaking from the Home Office. Would you be good enough to come
round and see me this morning any time before noon? The matter is
somewhat urgent."</p>

<p>Tiny's face expressed his bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Sure you've got the right bloke?" he said. "The Home Office is
a bit out of my line."</p>

<p>The man at the other end laughed.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," he answered. "You needn't be alarmed. Ask for Room
73."</p>

<p>"All right," said Tiny. "I'll be round about half-past
eleven."</p>

<p>"Now what the dickens does Colonel Gillson of the Home Office
want with me, Murdoch?" he remarked thoughtfully, as he hung up the
receiver. "And where is the Home Office, anyway?"</p>

<p>"A taxi-driver might know that, sir," said Murdoch helpfully.
"But to go back, sir, for the moment: when will you be
leaving?"</p>

<p>Tiny lit a cigarette, and blew out a great cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said at length. "That will leave me to-day to
tell the necessary lies in, and get my reservations."</p>

<p>"How long shall I pack for, sir?" inquired his man.</p>

<p>Tiny gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Ask me another," he said. "I'm darned if I know, Murdoch. Give
me enough to last a fortnight anyway. And one other thing." He
turned at the door. "Get that Colt revolver of mine oiled and
cleaned, and pack it in the centre of my kit."</p>

<p>He went down the stairs chuckling gently at the look of
scandalized horror on his valet's face. Revolvers! Switzerland in
the middle of the London season! Such things were simply not done,
as Murdoch explained a little later to his wife.</p>

<p>"Hindecent, I calls it: positively hindecent. Why we were dining
out every night."</p>

<p>But Tiny Carteret, supremely unconscious of the regal pronoun,
was strolling happily along Clarges Street. The morning was
perfect: London looked her best, but no twinge of regret assailed
him at leaving. There were many more mornings in the future when
London would look her best, but a hunt with Ronald Standish was not
a thing a man could hope for twice. And as he turned into
Piccadilly he found himself trying to puzzle out what the game was
going to be.</p>

<p>The Lake of Geneva! Could it be something to do with the League
of Nations? And Bolshevism? He rather hoped not. Unwashed
international Jews, plentifully covered with hair and masquerading
as Russians, failed to arouse his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Tiny. If you want to kiss me, do you mind doing it
somewhere else."</p>

<p>He came out of his reverie to find himself towering above a
delightful vision in blue.</p>

<p>"Vera, my angel," he said, "I eat dirt. For the moment my brain
was immersed in the realms of higher philosophy."</p>

<p>"You mean you were wondering if it was too early for a drink at
your club," she answered. "Anyway don't forget next week-end."</p>

<p>"Ah! next week-end. Now that's a bad affair&mdash;next week-end.
For to-morrow, most ravishing of your sex, I leave for
Switzerland."</p>

<p>"You do what?" she cried, staring at him.</p>

<p>"Leave for Switzerland," he grinned. "I am going to pick
beautiful mountain flowers&mdash;roses, and tulips and edelweisses
and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Tiny! You must be mad! What about our party?"</p>

<p>"I know, my pet. My heart is as water when I think of it. But it
is the doctor's orders. He says I require building up."</p>

<p>"There's a girl in it," she said accusingly.</p>

<p>"Thumbs crossed&mdash;there isn't. You are the only woman in my
life. Good God! my dear&mdash;it is a quarter past eleven. I must
hop it. Think of me, Vera, in the days to come&mdash;alone with
chamois&mdash;yodelling from height to height in my endeavours to
please the intelligent little fellows. Would you like me to yodel
now?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake don't. And I think you are a perfect
beast."</p>

<p>Tiny took out his handkerchief and began to sob loudly.</p>

<p>"Jilted!" he boomed in a loud voice, to the intense delight of a
crowd of people waiting close by for a motor-bus. "Jilted by a
woman for whom I have given up my honour, my fortune, even my
morning beer."</p>

<p>"You unspeakable ass," she cried, striving vainly not to laugh.
"Go away at once. And I hope you get mountain sickness, and die in
an avalanche."</p>

<p>He resumed his interrupted walk feeling rather guilty. He knew
that the girl he had just left had engineered the week-end party
simply and solely on his account, and he had gone and let her down.
Now it would be to her even as gall and wormwood, and she really
was a darling.</p>

<p>"In fact, young fellow," he ruminated, "you must go easier with
the little pretties in future. It's a shame to raise false hopes in
their sweet young hearts. And one of these days you'll get it in
the neck yourself."</p>

<p>He hailed a passing taxi and told the man to drive to the Home
Office. Vera Lethington was forgotten: the immediate and
interesting problem was, What did Colonel Gillson want with him?
Presumably it must be something to do with Ronald Standish, since
he could think of no other possible reason for the summons.</p>

<p>He asked for Room 73, and on giving his name was at once shown
up. Seated at the desk was a hatchet-faced man with an enormous
nose, who rose as he entered. He was very tall, and his eyes, keen
and steady, seemed to take in every detail of his visitor at a
glance.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Carteret," he said, and the words were short and
clipped. "Take a pew. I suppose you know why I rang you up."</p>

<p>"Well, since I haven't been copped in a nightclub raid, Colonel,
I can hazard a pretty shrewd guess," answered Tiny with a grin.</p>

<p>The other man smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"That's a matter for Scotland Yard. Incidentally you were having
a pretty good time at the Fifty-Nine last Tuesday."</p>

<p>Tiny gazed at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"How the devil do you know? You weren't there, were you?"</p>

<p>"I was not," laughed Gillson. "Nature has endowed me with a
nasal organ which renders me somewhat conspicuous. So I do not
frequent clubs of that sort."</p>

<p>"Then how did you know?" persisted Tiny.</p>

<p>"Had you been stopping in London," said the other quietly, "now
that I know you are a friend of Standish, I should have given you a
word of warning about that club."</p>

<p>"You assume I am not stopping on then," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Naturally," answered Gillson. "A man with fifteen caps would
hardly be likely to."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's rot, Colonel. But you still haven't told me how you
knew I was there."</p>

<p>"I've got a list, my dear boy, of every single soul who was in
that club that night. Your waiter gave it to me."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish the damned fellow had concentrated more on his
waiting and less on making a list. He slopped soup all over my
trousers."</p>

<p>"Seeing it was the first time he had waited I don't suppose he
was too bad," said the other quietly. "A bad spot that, Carteret: a
festering sore. I don't mean because they sell liquor out of hours:
that by comparison is nothing. But it is the centre..." He paused
and lit a cigarette. "Well, I wouldn't be surprised if in the
course of the next few weeks you didn't find yourself back there
again&mdash;shall we say professionally."</p>

<p>"This is all deuced intriguing, Colonel," said Tiny. "Can't you
be a bit more explicit?"</p>

<p>"All in good time, my dear fellow. Let us first get down to the
immediate future. I assume you are leaving to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Quite right," answered Tiny. "Provided I can get
reservations."</p>

<p>Colonel Gillson opened a drawer in his desk.</p>

<p>"I've got them all here," he said calmly. "And your ticket as
well."</p>

<p>"The devil you have," spluttered Tiny, half inclined to be
annoyed. "And supposing I hadn't been going to-morrow."</p>

<p>The older man looked at him steadily for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Then I should have made a very bad mistake in my judgment of
human nature," he said quietly. "A mistake which would have
disappointed me greatly."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," answered Tiny, all his irritation gone.
"That's a very decent thing to say."</p>

<p>"Now then," said the other, "we'll get down to brass tacks. You
will go by the 10.45 train from Victoria: your seat is booked in
Pullman S.2. Take the Golden Arrow to Paris: then go to Philippe's
Restaurant in the Rue Danou. You know it?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do, Colonel."</p>

<p>"You will find it one of the most delightful restaurants in
Paris. The <i>homard à la maison</i> is one of the wonders of the
world. It is a small place, but travelling as you are by the Golden
Arrow you will almost certainly be the first arrival, so that you
will have no trouble over getting a table."</p>

<p>"If there is, I'll mention your name."</p>

<p>"Under no circumstances will you do anything of the sort,
Carteret," said the other quietly. "Under no circumstances are you
to mention to a soul that you have seen me to-day. Do you remember
that French notice in the war&mdash;'Mefiez vous. Taisez vous. Les
oreilles de l'ennemi vous écoutent.'"</p>

<p>He smiled a little at the look of astonishment on Tiny's
face.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he continued, "don't think I'm being
melodramatic. But in our trade the first rule, the second rule, and
the last rule are all the same. Never say a word more than is
necessary. And to mention my name there would not only be
unnecessary, but might be suicidal. You don't suppose, do you, that
I am giving you these detailed instructions merely to ensure that
you have a good dinner?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no," laughed Tiny. "I don't. But you must remember,
Colonel, that this sort of work is a new one on me. Anyway what is
going to happen when I've got down to the <i>homard à la
maison</i>?"</p>

<p>"A message will be given to you either verbally or in writing:
which I do not know, and exactly when I do not know. If in writing
commit it to memory, and destroy the paper."</p>

<p>"Who will give me this message?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"A man," said the other. "Don't ask me to tell you what he will
look like, for I haven't the faintest idea. Have you got it clear
so far?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"When you've had your dinner you will go to the Gare de Lyons in
time to catch the 9.10 train for Switzerland. I have reserved you a
berth in a sleeper, and it is more than probable, Carteret, that
when you come to inspect that reservation and all that goes with it
you will consign me to the nethermost depths of the pit."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Colonel?" said the bewildered Tiny.</p>

<p>"You will find out in due course," answered the other with a
grin. "But there is one thing, young fellow, and don't you forget
it." The grin had departed. "Under no circumstances whatever are
you to alter your bunk&mdash;not even if the rest of the coach is
empty."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir. I can't profess to understand what it is
all about at the moment, but I know an order when I hear one. I
sleep"&mdash;he glanced at the paper in his hand&mdash;"in Number 8
bunk. Hullo! the ticket is only as far as Lausanne."</p>

<p>"That is where you get out," said Gillson. "A room has been
already taken for you at the Ouchy Palace Hotel. Go there, and then
Standish will take over the ordering of your young life."</p>

<p>He rose, to show that the interview was over.</p>

<p>"But, dash it all, Colonel," pleaded Tiny, "can't you give me
some idea as to what the game is?"</p>

<p>Gillson shook his head.</p>

<p>"You will find out all that it is good for you to know, at the
time when it is good for you to know it. Believe me, my dear
fellow, this reticence doesn't imply any lack of confidence on my
part. But there are certain occasions when real genuine ignorance
is worth untold gold. Standish is playing the hand at the moment,
and you are a very important card. It must be left to him to decide
when he is going to play you, and how he is going to play you. But
if it is any comfort I can tell you one thing. I'd give a year's
screw if some divine act of Providence would blast away a lump of
my cursed nose. For with that landmark gone I could have faked my
face sufficiently to go in your place."</p>

<p>"That sounds all right, anyway," laughed Tiny. "Any message for
Ronald?"</p>

<p>And as he asked the question the telephone rang on the desk.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said the Colonel. "Hullo!"</p>

<p>Tiny watched him idly as he stood there with the receiver to his
ear. The lean hatchet face seemed frozen into a mask, so
expressionless was it: only the eyes were glowingly alive. At last
the voice from the other end ceased, and Gillson spoke.</p>

<p>"Can you come up at once, Dexter? You can. Good."</p>

<p>He replaced the instrument, and then stood motionless for more
than a minute staring out of the window.</p>

<p>"Any message for Ronald," he said at length. "Yes, Carteret;
there will be. You can tell him that Jebson has been murdered in
the same way as the others. Wait a little. Dexter is coming, and
we'll hear all about it. Incidentally, you know Dexter. You'd
better dun him for another pair of trousers."</p>

<p>"You mean he was the waiter at the Fifty-Nine?"</p>

<p>But the other appeared not to have heard. With his hands in his
pockets he was pacing up and down the office, his head thrust
forward, his chin sunk on his chest, whilst Tiny leaned against the
desk smoking. He did not speak again: he was busy with his own
thoughts. So there was murder in the business, was there?... And
more than one at that. And almost as if it was an echo of what was
passing through his mind Colonel Gillson suddenly ceased his
restless pacing and spoke.</p>

<p>"Don't be under any delusions, young Carteret. We're up against
the big stuff this time with a vengeance."</p>

<p>He swung round as a knock sounded on the door.</p>

<p>"Come," he called, and a man entered whom Tiny recognized at
once as the waiter.</p>

<p>"Morning, Dexter," said Gillson. "Bad affair this. You know Mr.
Carteret, I think. He tells me you spoilt his trousers for
him."</p>

<p>The new-comer grinned at Tiny.</p>

<p>"Sorry about it, Mr. Carteret. If only you'd stuck to kippers it
would have been all right." He grew serious again and turned to
Gillson. "You're right, sir: it is a bad affair. Am I to..." He
glanced hesitatingly at Tiny.</p>

<p>"Carry on, Dexter. Mr. Carteret is now one of us."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Jebson as you know was our permanency at the
Fifty-Nine. He's been there now for over three months, and up to
yesterday he was convinced that not a soul suspected he was not a
genuine waiter. I saw him myself at lunchtime and he told me so.
He's been waiting on two of the private rooms upstairs, and for
over a fortnight nothing of any importance has taken place. Just
the usual young fool, with the usual woman. But last night he told
me he was expecting something of interest. That little swine
Giuseppi who owns the place had been running in and out of one of
his two rooms the whole morning, cursing and swearing and saying
that this was wrong and that was wrong&mdash;a thing he never did
for his ordinary <i>clientèle</i>. And then Jebson, happening to
pass Giuseppi's office, heard him on the telephone ordering masses
of orchids. Mauve orchids," he added meaningly.</p>

<p>Once again he paused and glanced at Tiny, as if doubtful whether
to proceed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carteret understands, Dexter, that any name he may hear
mentioned in this office is as inviolate as if it was in
confession," said Gillson quietly.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," continued Dexter. "He at once appreciated the
possible significance: the flowers had been mauve orchids the time
before."</p>

<p>"Mauve orchids," said Tiny slowly. "Mauve orchids! Good Lord!
it's impossible."</p>

<p>"What is impossible?" asked Gillson quietly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir, nothing. It was only a wild idea that flashed
through my mind. Just a strange coincidence."</p>

<p>"The longer you are in this job, my boy, the more will you
realize that nothing is impossible," said Gillson. "Well, Dexter:
was it she?"</p>

<p>"That's the devil of it, sir&mdash;we don't know. Jebson
did&mdash;but Jebson is dead. We don't know if it was Lady
Mary."</p>

<p>Gillson's eyes were fixed on Tiny&mdash;a faintly quizzical look
in them.</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible, Carteret," he repeated quietly. "So that
was the idea that had flashed through your mind."</p>

<p>"No: no, Colonel&mdash;nothing of the sort. Heavens! Nothing
would induce Mary Ridgeway to go to a private room at the
Fifty-Nine."</p>

<p>"And yet she was there six weeks ago alone with a man," said
Gillson.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Colonel," said Tiny angrily, "this is going beyond a
joke. Mary is a great personal friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Do you really imagine, Carteret," said the older man coldly,
"that I should take the trouble to make a statement of that sort
about any woman, whether she was a friend of yours or whether she
wasn't, unless I knew it to be true? Well, Dexter?"</p>

<p>"That's all, sir. That's the sickening part of it. Jebson, poor
devil, has been done in."</p>

<p>Tiny took a step forward.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," he said to Gillson, "I apologize for my last
remark. But you <i>cannot</i> mean to tell me that even if Lady
Mary was there you hold her in any way responsible for this man
Jebson's death?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not," answered Gillson at once. "Such an idea
never crossed my brain for a second. The person who is responsible
for Jebson's death, is the man with whom Lady Mary&mdash;if it was
she&mdash;was having supper. And he is the man we want, or perhaps
I should say&mdash;one of the many men we want."</p>

<p>Tiny sank into a chair, his brain whirling. The whole thing was
too preposterous. And yet&mdash;was it? Statements made in this
quiet office seemed to carry with them a definite conviction which
shook him. And Gillson had quietly said in the most matter-of-fact
voice that six weeks ago she <i>had</i>been to the Fifty-Nine alone
with a man. If so&mdash;what about last night?</p>

<p>He had been dancing with her at a house in Berkeley Square, and
it had struck him more than once during the evening that she had
seemed unusually <i>distraite</i>&mdash;so much so, in fact, that
he had pulled her leg about it. And then at half-past eleven she
had pleaded a headache and left. Nothing much to go on so far, it
was true: but it was the matter of the mauve orchids that worried
him, and that&mdash;he cursed himself now for not having kept a
better guard on his tongue&mdash;had made him say what he did. Mary
adored mauve orchids: all her friends knew it: half the world knew
it on the evidence of Aunt Tabitha in <i>Society Snippets</i>.</p>

<p>And yet the whole thing seemed too preposterous. She was
undoubtedly an unconventional girl, but there were certain things
at which she would draw a very fast line. And it seemed to Tiny
that dining in a private room at a place like the Fifty-Nine alone
with a man was most emphatically one of them. Unless she had to:
unless she had no alternative. He lit a cigarette thoughtfully, and
then conscious that Gillson was eyeing him shrewdly he pulled
himself together. His sudden remark could easily be attributed to
the matter of mauve orchids: for the moment at any rate he saw no
necessity to mention what he knew of her movements the previous
night. Dexter was speaking, and Tiny forced himself to listen.</p>

<p>"Just the same way, sir&mdash;the same in every detail. He was
an unmarried man and he lodged in a back road off Hammersmith
Broadway. The woman who keeps the house heard him come in about two
o'clock&mdash;she is sure about that because she happened to be
awake at the time and the clock in her room struck the hour. Then
she dozed off only to be woken up about an hour later by a choking
sort of cry. Half shout&mdash;half moan is how she described it to
me. Then there came the sound of a heavy fall in the room above
her&mdash;the room which belonged to Jebson. Thinking he might be
ill she put on her dressing-gown and ran upstairs. Then apparently
she threw a faint at what she saw.</p>

<p>"I really don't blame her, sir," went on Dexter. "I saw the poor
devil this morning and he was a pretty ghastly sight. He was in his
pyjamas, half in and half out of bed. One hand was thrown up as if
to ward something off, and his face was contorted hideously. Just
like the others. Teeth bared: and only the whites of his eyes
showing."</p>

<p>"Was the light on or off when the woman went in?" asked
Gillson.</p>

<p>"On, sir. He was evidently just getting into bed."</p>

<p>"And the window?"</p>

<p>"Wide open."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible, without great difficulty, for someone
outside to get in through the window?</p>

<p>"Quite impossible, sir, unless a ladder was used. But the room
looks out at the back of the building. And about three yards away
there is a sort of outhouse place. Nothing would be easier than for
an agile man to scramble up on the roof of the outhouse, from where
he could see straight into Jebson's room."</p>

<p>"Quite." Gillson nodded thoughtfully. "And where was it this
time?"</p>

<p>"In the chest."</p>

<p>"Where was what?" cried Tiny.</p>

<p>"This is the fourth affair of this sort that has taken place,"
said Gillson. "In each case the appearance of the victims has been
the same&mdash;distorted features, teeth set in a rigid snarl, only
the whites of the eyes showing. And in each case somewhere or other
on the body there has been a small scratch. But on no occasion has
the thing with which the scratch was made been found. You found
nothing, did you, Dexter, this time?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, sir, though I went over the room with a fine
tooth- comb."</p>

<p>"But have you no explanation, Colonel?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"I certainly have an explanation as far as it goes.
Unfortunately that isn't very far. That these four men were
murdered I have no doubt, and they were murdered in precisely the
same way. They were killed by the introduction into their system of
some form of unknown poison, probably of the snake venom variety.
It was injected through the scratch, and the ghastly expression on
their faces was due to the agony of the muscular contortion as they
died. But how was it injected? How was the scratch made?"</p>

<p>"Blow-pipe and poisoned dart," suggested Tiny.</p>

<p>"You can blow a dart out of a pipe, Carteret," said the other,
"but I have yet to hear of a person who can suck it back again. If
it had been done that way we should have found the darts."</p>

<p>"That's true," agreed Tiny. "I suppose it couldn't have been
done by actually introducing a snake into the room."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Mr. Carteret," said Dexter. "At least&mdash;almost
impossible. I wouldn't say that anything was quite impossible in
this case. But there are a number of difficulties over such a
solution. How was it got into the room: how was it got away again?
Besides, so far as I know there is no known brand of snake whose
bite causes practically instantaneous death. Well, you aren't going
to tell me that if Jebson found that he had been bitten by a snake
he was going to do nothing about it until he died twenty minutes or
so later."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Tiny, "the same objection applies to whatever it
was that did it. You can't have a hole made in your chest without
knowing it."</p>

<p>"Precisely," remarked Gillson. "To my mind that is the essence
of the entire thing. And it is such an amazing feature of all the
cases that there can be only one solution. Consider the facts. Four
trained officers&mdash;each of them scratched by something: each of
them taking some period of time&mdash;how long we do not
know&mdash;to die, and yet not one of them doing anything during
that period, either to call for help or even to write a message on
a piece of paper. It is incredible: it is preposterous unless we
assume one of two things. Either the poison is to all intents and
purposes instantaneous, or they attached no importance to the
initial puncture."</p>

<p>Dexter nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I get your meaning, sir. Though it doesn't seem to make things
any easier," he added ruefully. "By what possible method could the
scratch be made to seem accidental, and yet not be accidental?"</p>

<p>"When you have solved that, Dexter, you have solved the problem.
But of one thing I am certain. None of those poor devils connected
the pain they were suffering&mdash;pain which must have increased
to agony at the end&mdash;with the thing that pricked them. If they
had&mdash;with their training, their sense of duty&mdash;they would
have left some record of it."</p>

<p>"Mightn't it be possible," put in Tiny, "that they did leave
some message? And then, once they were dead, the murderer, who
could then afford to take his time, destroyed it. From what you
say, Dexter, the old lady fainted. Isn't it feasible that the
murderer, who was concealed in the room the whole time, took the
chance and calmly hopped it?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't get over my initial difficulty, Carteret," said
Gillson. "What about that period of time between the puncture and
death? Do you mean to tell me that Jebson was going to allow some
strange man in his bedroom to stab him in the chest, and not raise
Cain?"</p>

<p>"It's the devil," said Dexter. "Because whether it seemed an
accident or whether it didn't, they had to make certain of doing it
last night. I'm sure of that, though of course we've got no
proof."</p>

<p>Tiny lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"What should make you so sure of that?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I believe he found out something whilst he was waiting," said
the other. "And then perhaps he gave himself away&mdash;who knows?
At any rate they did him in before he could make his report."</p>

<p>"Well, really, my dear fellow," remarked Tiny, "if you'll
forgive my saying so, it seems a piece of the wildest guesswork.
Why you should assume that there is any connection between this
poor devil's death in Hammersmith, and a party in a private room at
the Fifty-Nine is beyond my diminutive brain. And you, Colonel,
went so far as to say that the man giving the party actually did
it."</p>

<p>"Not so, Carteret: I said he was responsible for it. Which is
rather different."</p>

<p>"A matter of words, sir. But I cannot forget either&mdash;going
back a bit in the discussion&mdash;that the name of a great
personal friend of mine was mentioned as possibly having been in
that room. Well, put it how you will&mdash;though I quite realize
that what is said inside these four walls is sacred&mdash;it's a
pretty serious matter. Following it to its logical conclusion,
Colonel, it boils down to this. That whoever the lady was who was
present, she took part in some conversation with the others who
were present which resulted in the murder of the man who was
waiting on them. Am I right?"</p>

<p>Colonel Gillson took a couple of turns up and down the room:
then he swung round and faced Tiny.</p>

<p>"I see that I shall have to alter my decision, Carteret." He
glanced at his watch. "Come and have lunch with me at the Rag, and
I'll put you wise."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"NOW you'll understand, Carteret, that what I'm
going to tell you is for your ears and your ears alone."</p>

<p>The two men were seated in a corner of the smoking-room with
coffee and brandy on the table in front of them.</p>

<p>"Fire ahead, Colonel. I don't mind confessing that I'm deuced
curious. And you have my promise that I shan't say a word to a
soul."</p>

<p>"I'll make it as short as possible," began Gillson. "And you had
better realize right away from the start that a great deal of what
I am going to say is in the nature of conjecture or even guesswork.
Certain bald facts stick out, and on those pegs we have had to
build up our theory. How much of that theory is right, and how much
wrong, only time will show. And reading between the lines of a
letter Standish wrote me, I think the time is pretty close at
hand.</p>

<p>"However, let's get on with it. About five years ago there was a
series of extraordinary and apparently disconnected crimes. They
were not confined to England: in fact some of the most remarkable
of them took place abroad. To take only a few at random. The murder
of Rodrigo, the Spanish millionaire banker, in his house in Madrid;
the death of Steiner, the German coal magnate, in Essen; Vanderstum
the Dutchman, who was shot late one night when going back from a
dinner-party in Amsterdam; Leyland, one of our own millionaires who
was brutally done to death in an hotel in Liverpool&mdash;there are
four that spring to my mind. And as I say, at first sight there
seemed no connection between them. But if you go a little deeper
into it you will find one factor that is common to all. In each of
the four cases I have mentioned the death of the victim was of
inestimable value to certain other people. I won't bore you with
the why and the wherefore, but the bald fact remains that no tears
were shed by various vested interests when they died. Don't
misunderstand me: I don't mean the same vested interest in each
case&mdash;I mean four different ones."</p>

<p>"I get you perfectly, Colonel," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"About that time, too, strange rumours began to go round in the
underworld. At first the police paid no attention to them: then it
was found that the same stories were being circulated in Paris and
Berlin and all over the continent. It was the rumour of a thing
which has long been the subject of sensational fiction&mdash;namely
the super-criminal. The Napoleon of crime had at last
arrived&mdash;the man who sat at the centre of things and pulled
the strings while others did the work.</p>

<p>"For a long time I refused to believe it, but at length the
evidence became so overwhelming that I had no alternative but to
agree. Somewhere or other there was a controlling influence at
work, though whether it was one man or several we didn't know. Nor
do we know to-day. But after having sifted all the information we
could lay our hands on, and rejected every scrap which seemed in
the smallest degree doubtful, we came to the definite conclusion
that a new factor in crime had arisen and a damned dangerous factor
too. In short, we were confronted with a central body of
unscrupulous and clever men who were prepared&mdash;at a
price&mdash;to do your crimes for you."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Colonel&mdash;it sounds incredible."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is the truth," said the other gravely. "It is a
lamentable fact, but when you come into the realms of high finance
a good many standards seem to change. And though I do not say for a
moment that the people who stood to be ruined by Leyland, for
instance, would ever have gone to the length of murdering him
themselves, they were by no means averse to somebody else doing it
for them. Of course, to a certain extent all this is conjecture.
Not one of the many men who, I believe, were collectively
responsible for Leyland's death has ever said a word. Naturally
not. Though it is possibly suggestive that one of them&mdash;a man
well known and well respected&mdash;has since committed suicide for
no apparent reason."</p>

<p>"But what I don't understand," interrupted Tiny, "is how the
dickens they set about it. How did they get in touch with this
central body?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose they did for a moment: the central body got in
touch with them. My dear Carteret, if our theory is correct we are
dealing with people whose brains are quite the equivalent of our
own. We are dealing with an organization which has ramifications
and spies all over the place through whom it collects its
information. And I believe what happened was this.
Someone&mdash;some underling&mdash;cautiously approached one of the
men who were up against Leyland. Probably no mention of the word
murder was made. Probably all that was said was that for some large
sum of money it could be guaranteed that Leyland would change his
policy. Which shows, mark you, if my supposition is correct, that
they are no ordinary type of criminal. Hard-headed business men
don't part with their cash on vague promises, unless the man who
makes them is pretty convincing. Anyway&mdash;still sticking to our
theory&mdash;the fact remains that they did stump up, and Leyland
was murdered."</p>

<p>"Have you any proof that they stumped up?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"No actual proof. But it is a significant fact that the bank
account of the man who committed suicide shows that he drew out a
sum of five thousand pounds about a week before Leyland was
murdered&mdash;a proceeding so foreign to his usual habits that the
cashier remarked on it."</p>

<p>"But surely something should be done about it."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said the other, with a short laugh, "one of
the first things you find out in this game is the difference
between knowing and proving. You won't believe it, but the police
know of four men at large in London to-day&mdash;two of them
members of first-class clubs&mdash;who have all committed murder.
But they can't prove it, so nothing can be done. However, that is a
digression: let's return to our friends. We dug and we delved: we
tried channels known to us and channels unknown to us. We pieced
together information received from every imaginable quarter and
after a time things did begin to look a little clearer. But always
did we come up against one impenetrable wall&mdash;the wall that we
still haven't succeeded in climbing. Where is the big man? Who is
the big man? At this minute we could lay our hands on half a dozen
underlings, but where is the boss?"</p>

<p>"Interrupting you for a moment, Colonel," said Tiny, "did they
use this poison on any of the cases you have mentioned?"</p>

<p>"No. That little joy is of comparative recent date. And you will
be amazed when I tell you what we are now convinced was the first
occasion it was used&mdash;at any rate in this country. Do you
remember the sudden death of Prometheus just before the
Cambridgeshire two years ago when the horse was at evens?"</p>

<p>"Do I not?" said Tiny grimly. "I stood to win a monkey over the
double with Galloping Lad."</p>

<p>"Precisely. And there were a good many other people besides you
who had backed Galloping Lad for the Cesarewitch. In fact if
Prometheus had won, the bookies would have had the skinning of
their lives."</p>

<p>"But, Colonel, you surely don't imply that there was foul play,
do you? The horse was just found dead in his box one morning."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Doubled up in the most dreadful
contortions&mdash;teeth bared, head a mass of bruises where the
poor brute had hurled itself against the walls in his agony, and
the stable-boy with a fractured skull in the corner of the box, due
to the horse having kicked him in its frenzy."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Tiny, "the case is coming back to me. When the
boy was fit to be examined he swore on his Bible oath that he
hadn't heard a sound till the horse started bucking and rearing in
the box. Then he had rushed in and been kicked. That was it, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"That was it. And I've mentioned the case only because, though
we didn't know it at the time, I am convinced now that that was the
first time this poison was used. It was a new one on us then: no
one thought of looking for any puncture, and anyway it would have
been very hard to find in a horse's coat. The vet was completely
nonplussed, but the horse was dead, and that was all there was to
it. The boy was put through a searching cross-examination later,
but he stuck to the same story. He said that he had been asleep as
usual in front of the door of the box: that he was a very light
sleeper, and that no one could possibly have got to the horse
without waking him. And so after a while, though a lot of people
maintained that the horse had been tampered with, the accepted
verdict was that it had died of some inexplicable disease of the
heart which had attacked it suddenly."</p>

<p>"Hold hard a minute, Colonel. Does this poison leave no
trace?"</p>

<p>"No chemical trace. But it affects the muscles of the heart,
tautening them up and in non-medical language bringing on acute
cramp. Hence the agony which the victims suffer just before
death."</p>

<p>"It sounds awfully jolly," murmured Tiny. "Do you mind if I have
another spot of brandy? But the point I can't get at is this. If
the boy was speaking the truth: if the door of the loose box was
shut&mdash;how was the poison administered?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Carteret: frankly I don't know. The window was
open: the top half of the door consisted of bars as usual. If a
poisoned dart was used on that occasion we should never have found
it in the straw even if anyone had thought of looking for it.
But&mdash;let's get on. It is really immaterial whether the poor
brute was killed that way or not: there are other far more
important things at stake. And perhaps the most important is the
fact that from about that time we began to notice a subtle
difference in the activities of the gang&mdash;a difference which
brought Standish and me in more directly than before. Until then
the matter had been essentially a police affair: now they began to
interest themselves in political affairs. True only if big money
was likely to be available: but it was a new departure, and one
which made things even more serious."</p>

<p>He paused and lit a cigarette: then abruptly he turned to
Tiny.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of Felton Blake?"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;to the best of my knowledge," answered Tiny.</p>

<p>"Felton Blake is one of the most perfect examples of the
criminal mind that exists to-day. From his appearance you would put
him down as a successful lawyer or doctor. He is a clean-shaven,
dark, distinctly good- looking man of about forty-five. He has a
large house in Hampstead, where he entertains lavishly and well. He
states, should the question arise, that he is a merchant broker,
and he does, in fact, run an office somewhere down in the city. An
absolute blind, of course: in reality the man is the most dangerous
blackmailer in Europe. He is completely devoid of pity: the most
usurious money-lender is a tender-hearted woman compared to him.
Once his claws are into a human being, the poor wretch can say
good-bye to hope. He is a member of this gang, and a very prominent
one. And"&mdash;once again he paused&mdash;"he is the man with whom
Lady Mary Ridgeway was having supper at the Fifty-Nine six weeks
ago."</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Tiny. "Are you sure, sir?"</p>

<p>"Jebson&mdash;the man who was murdered last night&mdash;though
not then waiting on the private room, made it his business to be
hanging round when Blake left. He had seen him go in: had seen that
he had a lady with him, but had not been able to see her face. He
succeeded as she left: it was Lady Mary."</p>

<p>"But, Great Scott! Colonel&mdash;what the devil can it mean? Is
he trying to blackmail her? If so, what for? I mean&mdash;she's a
cheery soul: does damned fool things at times. But&mdash;blackmail
Mary. I can't believe it."</p>

<p>"Is it any harder to believe than the mere fact that she was
there?"</p>

<p>"Do you think she has written some letters or something like
that? And he's got hold of them? Because if so I'll go and break
every bone in the swine's body."</p>

<p>The older man smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"A very natural instinct, Carteret&mdash;but one which I fear
you will have to repress. I gather you know Lady Mary pretty well,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Tiny and then hesitated. "Look here, Colonel," he
burst out, "you've been pretty frank with me: I'll return the
compliment. I didn't say anything in your office, but after all
there is no good having half confidences. Of course&mdash;there may
be nothing in it. I was dancing with her last night, and she was
frightfully glum all through the evening. Not a bit her usual
self&mdash;in fact I pulled her leg about it. And then at half-past
eleven she suddenly coughed up something about a headache and
pushed off. Moreover, she bit me good and proper when I suggested
running her home."</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me, Carteret," said Gillson quietly. "As you
say there may be nothing in it; at the same time it shows us that
she might have been there."</p>

<p>"But, damn it&mdash;why should she be there?" exploded Tiny.</p>

<p>"That is what I would give a good deal to know," answered
Gillson. "We can assume one thing at any rate: she did not go there
because she wanted to&mdash;she went because she had to. Therefore
Blake has some hold over her: or..."</p>

<p>"Or what?" demanded Tiny.</p>

<p>"She went there on behalf of somebody else."</p>

<p>"That's much more likely," remarked Tiny. "She's the most
kind-hearted creature in the world: do anything for a pal."</p>

<p>The other glanced cautiously round the room: then he bent
forward, and his voice was hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p>"You saw a good deal of Princess Olga when she was over here
three years ago, didn't you?"</p>

<p>For a moment or two Tiny stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>"I did," he said at length. "But firstly, how do you know; and
secondly, what has that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Gillson shortly, "don't be dense. Do you
imagine that when a Princess who is shortly to become Queen of
Bessonia comes over here on a visit we don't know who she goes
about with? And as to what it has to do with it&mdash;possibly a
lot. I think I'm right in saying that she and Lady Mary became very
great friends."</p>

<p>"You are," agreed Tiny. "Very great friends indeed."</p>

<p>"Six weeks ago Lady Mary returned from a visit to Bessonia where
she had stayed with the King and Queen. A few days later she has
supper with a notorious blackmailer in a private room at the
Fifty-Nine&mdash;admittedly a thing which only the greatest
provocation would cause her to do. Now do you see what I'm getting
at?"</p>

<p>"I gather that your implication is that she is acting on behalf
of the Queen. But I don't see that it takes us much further."</p>

<p>"It doesn't&mdash;and that is where you come in. Had Jebson not
been murdered, it might have been a different matter. As it is,
you've got to do what you can. But first of all get the points
clear in your mind. As I told you the activities of the gang have
of recent months tended to become political. Add to that the fact
that at the present moment Bessonia is the open powder-keg of
Europe. The overthrow of the King and Queen would undoubtedly cause
a grave crisis: but there are people who would pay a lot of money
to bring it about. There is the major side of the case: now for the
minor. Has Felton Blake got some hold over the King and
Queen&mdash;or over the Queen alone&mdash;which if used in the
proper quarter might bring about that overthrow? And is Lady Mary
acting as an emissary of the Queen to buy off Blake, or to persuade
him to hold his hand? That's what I want to find out: that's what I
believe Jebson <i>did</i> find out last night. And was murdered for
his pains."</p>

<p>He paused and lit a cigarette, while Tiny sat motionless,
staring at him.</p>

<p>"Understand, Carteret, that only two other men in the
world&mdash;on our side at any rate&mdash;know what I've been
telling you. One is Ronald Standish. Dexter knows nothing save the
obvious fact that Lady Mary had supper with Felton Blake. His is
purely the police side of the show: this is our end of it."</p>

<p>"But surely, Colonel," said Tiny at length, "in a case of such
gravity as this something could be done with this man Blake.
Couldn't he be run in&mdash;on a faked charge if necessary?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"You can't run a man in on a faked charge in this country,
Carteret. At least not in peace-time. And as to a genuine charge
against the swine&mdash;he's far too clever. Blake only deals in
those cases where the consequences to the victim if he did come
forward and lay information would be such that he simply daren't do
it. There are probably forty people to-day, any one of whom could
get that blackguard sent to prison for fifteen years. But not one
of them will do it. Some day, of course, a social benefactor will
come along who will murder Blake. And then he will be tried for his
life and probably hanged. But until that moment arrives we have got
to fight Blake with legitimate weapons."</p>

<p>"Exactly what do you want me to do?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"I would suggest that you call round and see Lady Mary this
afternoon&mdash;ostensibly to say good-bye to her. Or to inquire if
her headache is better. Then I leave it entirely to you. Find out
what you can. Even the certainty that she was at the Fifty-Nine
last night would be something."</p>

<p>"Can't say I like it much, Colonel."</p>

<p>"You are free to back out now, Carteret. You are not under my
orders. But I think you are viewing the thing from the wrong
aspect. Don't get into your head the idea that I am asking you to
spy on her. We are entirely on her side&mdash;and the more we know
the more we can help her. If only people who are up against the
Blakes of this world would realize that&mdash;Lord! what a
difference it would make."</p>

<p>"Yes: I quite see that. All right&mdash;I'll have a dip at it.
But don't expect too much, sir. Mary is not an easy person to pump.
By the way&mdash;you don't happen to know the number of the private
room, do you?"</p>

<p>The other rose.</p>

<p>"Wait here. I'll telephone and find out."</p>

<p>He threaded his way through the now half-empty room, leaving
Tiny with his brain whirling. It was the extraordinary inside
knowledge about other people's movements that Gillson had which
amazed him. And yet he had seemed to take it quite as a matter of
course. Then his mind switched over to the immediate problem. Deep
down he felt instinctively that Mary had been to the Fifty-Nine the
night before. She had been so utterly unlike her usual self that
there must have been something pretty drastic to account for it.
And suddenly he became quite definitely aware of the fact that the
thought of Mary having supper with Felton Blake affected him
considerably more than if it had been Vera Lethington for example.
The idea that there could be anything between them was simply
laughable; and yet.... Why the Fifty-Nine? Why a private room?
Surely if there was anything in this idea of Gillson's&mdash;if
Mary was acting as a go-between for the Queen of Bessonia&mdash;she
could have sent for Blake to come to her house.</p>

<p>His mind went back to the time three years ago when as Princess
Olga he had seen a lot of her. Several little <i>partis carrés</i>
with Mary and a cheery fellow about his own age. What the deuce was
his name? He could remember him perfectly distinctly&mdash;a tall
fair bloke with hair that crinkled naturally. Joe something or
other. Funny now that he came to think of it, but he'd never seen
him since. Seemed to have disappeared completely. Probably out in
Kenya, or one of the colonies. What the devil was his name?
Joe....</p>

<p>"Room number 7."</p>

<p>Tiny came out of his reverie to find Gillson standing beside
him.</p>

<p>"Right, Colonel!" He got up. "It's a quarter past three now:
I'll probably drift in to see her about half an hour before
cocktail time. Best chance of finding her alone. And I'll let you
know if I find out anything. Incidentally do the arrangements for
to-morrow still hold?"</p>

<p>"They do," said the other. "And I know no more than you do what
will happen afterwards. There is only one bit of advice I can give
you&mdash;keep your eyes skinned. For unless I'm much mistaken the
time is coming when you'll want 'em in the back of your head."</p>

<p>Tiny grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me, sir. The only thing I'm not frantically set
on is this poison stuff. Your description of the symptoms sounded
most entertaining."</p>

<p>But there was no answering smile on the other's face.</p>

<p>"Take care, my boy," he said gravely. "There's no jest about
this matter. And I'd like you to add to the fifteen next winter.
Don't forget: <i>sleep</i> with one eye open. And ring me up
to-night at eight o'clock and tell me what you've found out....
Sloane 1234 is the number."</p>

<p>Tiny strolled along Pall Mall still puzzling over the elusive
name. At times it was on the tip of his tongue: then it was gone
again. He would ask Mary when he saw her: she'd remember. Joe...
Joe.... Though, after all, what the devil did it matter? There were
vastly more important things to think about, not the least being
the method of tackling Mary. From a fairly profound knowledge of
her he realized that he would have to walk warily. If she got the
impression that he was coming as a sort of emissary of the police
the probability was that she would go straight off the deep end.
And small blame to her: he would feel the same himself. And yet he
saw quite clearly that what Gillson had said was right. Whatever
was the reason of her meeting Felton Blake, it was better for her
that it should be known. The point was&mdash;would she tell
him?</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch: two hours still to put through. It was
too early for tea: besides he felt as if he had only just finished
lunch. And as he stood cogitating on what to do at the corner
opposite the Athenaeum a magnificent Rolls-Royce swung past him and
turned up towards Piccadilly Circus. Unconsciously he glanced at
the people in it: then his eyes narrowed. For one of them was a
clean-shaven, dark, distinctly good-looking man who might have been
a successful lawyer: the other was Mary herself.</p>

<p>She had not seen him, but that fleeting glimpse had been enough
for him to see the expression on her face. And it had been like a
frozen mask: the man at her side might have been non-existent.</p>

<p>He felt instinctively that her companion was Felton Blake,
though he had never seen the man before in his life. And he began
to feel annoyed. Was Mary insane? In many ways it was more
indiscreet of her to drive alone with the man than to have supper
with him. Where one person might find out the latter, to drive
alone with him in the middle of the season was proclaiming the
thing to a hundred. Her features were far too well known: moreover,
as far as he could see she was making no attempt whatever to
conceal them.</p>

<p>He turned and strolled back the way he had come, and almost
immediately ran into Gillson on his way to the Home Office.</p>

<p>"Has that man Felton Blake got a yellow Rolls limousine with an
aluminium bonnet?" he demanded shortly.</p>

<p>"I should think it's more than likely," answered the other.
"He's rich enough to keep a dozen. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because if he has he's just passed me at the corner there with
Lady Mary alone in the car with him. Damn it! Colonel&mdash;the
girl has gone mad. I must say she was looking at the swab as if he
was something out of cheese. But fancy her doing such a thing! In
May, in London, in the middle of the afternoon!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget one thing, Carteret, in your quite natural
peevishness. Very few people except his actual victims know what
Blake really is. You may not have met him, but he is a man who is
received in very good society. So that it is not quite the howling
indiscretion it seems to you. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"White's&mdash;until it's time for me to go and see her."</p>

<p>"I'll find out about that question of the car and ring you up.
So long."</p>

<p>But when twenty minutes later one of the pages told him he was
wanted on the telephone he felt it was almost unnecessary to go. He
<i>knew</i>the man was Felton Blake: and Gillson's voice from the
other end telling him that the description fitted Blake's car only
confirmed a certainty.</p>

<p>He went moodily back into the smoking-room and flung himself
into a chair. The club was empty, a fact for which he was
profoundly thankful. He felt in no mood for conversation: he wanted
to try and get things straight in his head. And after a time one
fact began to stand out very clearly. If Jebson had been murdered
by this mysterious poison because he had overheard something the
night before, it was obvious that he himself would be in danger of
a similar attention, if it became known that Mary had confided in
him. Not that that mattered in the slightest. Tiny was as much
without fear as a man may be, and so long as he could help Mary
nothing else counted. But he also was no fool, and the prospect of
dying in the manner Gillson had described failed to appeal to him
in the slightest degree. At the same time if four skilled police
officers had all been caught, the odds were pretty strongly against
his escaping.</p>

<p>He wished now that he had asked Gillson more details about the
other three. Surely by comparing the four cases some factor common
to all must emerge, from which it would be possible to deduce
something. And yet the only deduction that seemed to have been made
so far was that the puncture in each case must have seemed
accidental to the victim. He quite saw the reasoning behind the
conclusion: at the same time there seemed to be some grave
difficulties in accepting such a conclusion. If it had genuinely
seemed accidental, then surely in each case it must have been pure
chance whether it came on or not. If, for instance, some form of
poisoned spike had been fixed somewhere in the room, it would be an
absolute fluke if the victim pricked himself on it. And if it was
fixed in something he was bound to use&mdash;his tooth-brush
say&mdash;it certainly would not seem accidental. Besides, only the
most eccentric people use tooth-brushes on their stomachs. And that
was where Jebson had got it.</p>

<p>At last he gave it up and sent for some tea. He would probably
solve the mystery personally, he reflected grimly, and until then
there was not much good worrying. The utmost he could hope for was
that if he was cast for the part of number five he would have the
time to pass on some warning for the benefit of number six.</p>

<p>At a quarter past five he left the club and hailed a taxi. And
while he waited for the machine, mindful of Gillson's instructions,
he stared fixedly at the passers-by, most of whom seemed to resent
it strongly. But with the exception of a Bishop, who Tiny regarded
with certainty as the murderer in disguise, they seemed
comparatively harmless.</p>

<p>He gave the driver the address, and sat down with care. Beyond
the fact, however, that the machine was obviously on the verge of
complete disintegration, he could see no cause for alarm. No spikes
stuck out anywhere, and though the cushion felt as if it was
stuffed with tin-tacks he arrived at his destination without any
perforation of the skin. And then came the first check. Her
ladyship was in, but the butler was not sure if she wished to see
anyone at the moment. She had come in with a headache, and had left
word that she did not wish to be disturbed.</p>

<p>"That's a nuisance, Simmonds," said Tiny. "Because I'm leaving
England to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Leaving England, sir! I dare say that would make a difference.
I'll ask her ladyship."</p>

<p>"What's that, Tiny?" A door at the end of the hall opened and
the girl herself put her head out. "Leaving England! Come in and
tell me about it. But no one else, Simmonds."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lady."</p>

<p>Tiny followed her into her own particular sanctum, and she
closed the door.</p>

<p>"It's sweet of you to see me, Mary dear," he said, taking both
her hands. "How's the head?"</p>

<p>"As an excuse it serves, Tiny. I felt I couldn't bear that
chattering cocktail crowd this evening. Sit down and tell me about
this sudden change of plan. What are you leaving England for? You
said nothing about it last night."</p>

<p>"I only decided this morning," he answered, sinking into a chair
and pulling out his cigarette-case. "And then you very nearly
altered my plans."</p>

<p>"I did? What <i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"Whilst communing with nature opposite the Athenaeum this
afternoon I narrowly escaped death from a large yellow Rolls. And
in that Rolls, Mary dear, I perceived you complete with gentleman
friend."</p>

<p>He spoke lightly, but the sudden tightening of her lips did not
escape him.</p>

<p>"I never saw you, Tiny." Her voice expressed only the most
perfunctory interest. "But since you did escape death, why this
strange move? And where are you going?"</p>

<p>"A sudden whim, my dear. I'm joining a very great pal of mine in
Switzerland, and we're going on a walking tour. We might even pop
over the border and go into Bessonia."</p>

<p>"Bessonia! Walking tour! My dear Tiny, what has come over you?"
She was staring at him in genuine amazement, as if she could hardly
believe her ears.</p>

<p>"Sounds a bit grim, doesn't it?" he laughed. "However, that's
the programme. I wonder," he added carelessly, "if the Queen would
remember me."</p>

<p>"Of course she does, Tiny," she said slowly. "She talked a lot
about you when I was there, Give me a cigarette, like a dear."</p>

<p>He handed her the box and struck a match. But he noticed that it
was quite an appreciable time before she seemed to be aware of
either.</p>

<p>"Tiny," she said, when he had sat down again, "are you serious?
Are you really going on a walking tour?"</p>

<p>"Like the headache, my dear&mdash;as an excuse it serves. By the
way," he went on, "it's funny how little things worry one. I've
been trying the whole afternoon to think of the name of that bloke
who used to play about with us such a lot when she was over here. I
can't get farther than Joe."</p>

<p>"Joe Denver," she said. "I suppose you don't know where he is,
Tiny?"</p>

<p>Was it his imagination, or did he detect a certain eager
tenseness in the question?</p>

<p>"Not a notion, my dear. I've never seen him since those days.
I've a sort of idea he was in Kenya or something like that."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any way of getting in touch with him," she
went on.</p>

<p>"I suppose an advertisement in the papers would do it in time.
But is there any special reason for doing so?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no. I just wondered." She passed her hand over her
forehead.</p>

<p>"Mary, dear, you're looking tired," he said quietly. "And
worried. Is there anything I can do to help? You know you've only
got to say the word."</p>

<p>"You're a dear, Tiny," and her voice was weary. "But there is
nothing, old lad, that you or anybody else can do, I fear me."</p>

<p>"Then there is something the matter," he said insistently.
"Can't you tell me, dear?"</p>

<p>"That's the devil of it: I can't. And even if I did it wouldn't
do any good."</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated: then he took the plunge.</p>

<p>"Mary, is it anything to do with that bloke you were driving
with this afternoon?"</p>

<p>She pressed out her cigarette.</p>

<p>"Tiny, drop it, please. I can't tell you. Let's change the
subject. What have you been doing to-day?"</p>

<p>"I lunched with a lad at the Rag," he said. It seemed to him
that the moment had come to go at it bald-headed. "One of these
mysterious sort of birds who move about behind the scenes, and
appear to know everything. He was very full of a murder that took
place last night. Some man down Hammersmith way&mdash;a
waiter."</p>

<p>"It hardly seems of surpassing interest," she remarked.</p>

<p>"He was a waiter at the Fifty-Nine Club, and apparently... Mary
dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>Every vestige of colour had left her face, and as he sprang
towards her she swayed in her chair. Then she pulled herself
together and pushed him away.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tiny. Stupid of me. I suddenly felt faint. I'm
not very fit these days. Tell me about this murder."</p>

<p>"There is very little to tell. The man was killed by some new
and hitherto unknown poison. The only point of interest is that
apparently he wasn't a waiter at all, but some secret service
agent."</p>

<p>And once again every vestige of colour left her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why on earth should they want a secret service agent at the
Fifty-Nine?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>Tiny shrugged his shoulders as if the matter had already begun
to bore him, though his heart was aching for her. What was the best
thing to do? Should he put all his cards on the table? Should he
tell her exactly what he suspected and implore her to confide in
him what the trouble was? Finally he decided to temporize.</p>

<p>"Ask me another, my dear. I believe some pretty rum things go on
in the private rooms there."</p>

<p>"It was a waiter for one of the private rooms, was it?"</p>

<p>"Number 7," he said, and stared straight at her. But by this
time she had controlled her expression, and the shot missed.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," she said. "Do you think that dark deeds of
treason were being discussed in the room, and that he overheard
them?"</p>

<p>"Nobody seems to know what went on in the room, or even who was
there, because he never sent in a report. In fact, the only thing
that seems to have come out up to date is that the table was
decorated with mauve orchids."</p>

<p>"My dear Tiny," she said lightly, "what on earth are you looking
at me like that for? Why shouldn't the table be decorated with
mauve orchids?"</p>

<p>"Mary dear," he answered steadily, "I'm going to chance it. I
must. Was it you who was having supper in that room last night?</p>

<p>"You must be mad, Tiny," she cried angrily.</p>

<p>"I wish I was, Mary. Listen, my dear, for it's got to be told.
This bloke I was lunching with to-day simply appalled me with his
inside knowledge. For instance, he knows that you had supper at the
Fifty-Nine Club in a private room about six weeks ago with a
notorious blackmailer called Felton Blake."</p>

<p>"Go on, please," she remarked icily. "I was always given to
understand that women's names were not bandied about in men's
clubs."</p>

<p>"My dear," he pleaded, "for God's sake, get it right. There was
no question of your name being bandied about. We were having a
private talk after lunch."</p>

<p>"The upshot of which appears to be that you, a man whom I have
always regarded as a friend, come round here to spy on me. I
suppose whatever you find out will be added to this gentleman's
inside knowledge."</p>

<p>"Mary," he cried passionately, "you can't think I'd be such a
swine as that. Don't you see, my dear, that if you are in
trouble&mdash;if this swab has a hold over you in any
way&mdash;it's vital that someone should help you."</p>

<p>"What I see is the most unwarrantable interference in my private
affairs. I foolishly imagined that if I did choose to have supper
six weeks ago at the Fifty-Nine it was my concern and nobody
else's."</p>

<p>"Even if the man you had supper with is a notorious
blackmailer?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"Even if he is a murderer, forger and thief rolled into one.
What business is it of anyone else's?" she cried passionately. "And
anyway, what are you driving at now? Even if I did have supper last
night at the Fifty-Nine, am I supposed to be responsible for this
so-called waiter's death?"</p>

<p>Tiny got up a little wearily.</p>

<p>"Then you won't tell me, Mary dear? You won't let me help
you."</p>

<p>For a moment her eyes softened: then she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I wish I could, Tiny: how I wish I could. Forgive me, old
man&mdash;I've been talking out of my turn a bit. I didn't mean all
that about spying on me: I do know you were trying to help. But
it's useless, my dear&mdash;useless."</p>

<p>"Mary, my dear," he stammered, "would it be useless if I were
in&mdash;well, in a position to look after you?"</p>

<p>"Bless his heart: he's proposing." She gave a tender little
laugh. "Bend down, Tiny." For a moment or two she stared at him:
then she kissed him on the lips. "Now run away, my dear, and forget
all about it."</p>

<p>And Tiny, being a man of understanding, went away. Just once by
the door he turned round and looked at her, and it seemed to him
that she looked weary unto death. Then a little blindly he went out
into the sunlit street.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THAT it had been Lady Mary Ridgeway with Felton
Blake the previous night he was convinced. True, she had not
actually admitted it, but her whole demeanour simply shouted the
fact. And as he walked moodily back to his club he tried vainly to
puzzle the thing out.</p>

<p>Tiny Carteret knew probably as much about Lady Mary Ridgeway as
any other man, and a good deal more than most. He knew all her
friends: they were both in the same set. And if anybody was likely
to have heard of any undesirable entanglement in the past it was
he. As he argued it to himself if she was in Felton Blake's power
it must be due to his possession of something incriminating
belonging to her. And that as far as he could see could only be
letters.... Love letters. Further, they must be letters written
either to some hopeless outsider, or to a married man. Otherwise,
though possibly injudicious, there would be nothing incriminating
about them.</p>

<p>The question of the outsider he dismissed at once: the mere
thought of such a thing in connection with Mary was laughable. And
the married man solution seemed almost as blank a wall. He made, of
course, no pretence whatever to such an extremely intimate inside
knowledge of her life, and there might have been some man ... might
even be one now. And a letter might have got mislaid, or been
stolen by a valet and sold to Blake. But somehow or
other&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;Tiny felt that if it had been
so rumours of it would have got about, at any rate in her own
immediate set. And there had never been such a rumour&mdash;not the
suspicion or hint of one: that he knew.</p>

<p>He tried another line&mdash;could it be money trouble? If
possible&mdash;even more absurd. Mary was very well off, and her
father the Duke was an extremely wealthy man, who adored her.
Besides, Gillson had said nothing about Blake being a
moneylender.</p>

<p>At which point in his reflections he realized that he didn't
seem to be making much progress. Incriminating letters and money
trouble removed there didn't seem to be a great deal left. And
quite naturally his thoughts turned along the other line; the line
at which Gillson had hinted that morning. Was she acting as a
go-between for the Queen?</p>

<p>If it was so he was in deeper waters than ever. Impossible
though it was to arrive at any conclusion if it was Mary herself
involved, it was doubly impossible if it was the Queen. And yet the
more he thought of it the more likely did it seem to him. In the
first place the mere fact that Gillson had suggested it as a likely
solution weighed with him. Never in his life had Tiny Carteret been
so impressed by a man's personality as he had been that morning. It
wasn't only the fact that the fellow had seemed to know such an
astounding amount about one's personal movements, he reflected: it
was the indefinable atmosphere of power about him ... inscrutable
to a certain extent, and yet quite prepared to throw all his cards
on the table if it suited him. And a damned hard man to bluff.</p>

<p>But apart from Gillson having considered it a possibility, Tiny
himself was inclining towards the idea. The difficulty of imagining
Mary herself to be the victim, necessitated finding another. And it
was a significant fact that the first time she had had supper with
Felton Blake was immediately on her return from Bessonia. Odd
remarks, to which he had attached no importance at the time, came
back to him&mdash;remarks made casually during the last few weeks
by pals of both sexes.</p>

<p>"Mary seems a bit off her oats." "Mary doesn't seem a bit
herself these days." And one in particular. "My dear, I believe
you've fallen in love with a Bessonian."</p>

<p>Trifles: laughed off as soon as made, but now taking on a new
significance in Tiny's brain. What had happened to Mary during her
visit there? He would have given all he possessed to know. In the
answer to that question lay the solution.</p>

<p>He ordered a gin and bitters and picked up an evening paper. One
of the headlines caught his eye&mdash;</p>

<p>CRITICAL SITUATION IN BESSONIA. INCREASING TENSION.</p>

<p>His eye travelled down the column.</p>

<p>"The situation in Bessonia is appreciably graver than it was
twenty-four hours ago. As yet there are no visible signs of
discontent and things are proceeding normally. But this state of
affairs exists only on the surface. To anyone acquainted with the
Bessonian temperament it is obvious that a clash must come soon
between the Royalist party and the International group, and what
the issue will be no one can say. At the moment the army remains
loyal."</p>

<p>He put down the paper, and lit a cigarette. Like the majority of
his fellow-countrymen, the internal affairs of remote foreign
states bored him to extinction. He dimly remembered that he had
heard a man at dinner a few nights ago saying something about the
condition of Bessonia, but he had paid no attention. And it began
to strike him now that if his surmise over Lady Mary was right, it
was high time he ceased to pay no attention. He glanced round the
room and saw the very man he wanted&mdash;Squire Straker, foreign
editor of the <i>Planet</i>.</p>

<p>"Straker, old hearty," he called out, "in return for a few
minutes of your valuable time I will donate you with a pink gin. Is
it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"Hullo! Tiny." The other lounged over&mdash;a big loosely made
man with a European reputation. "Don't often see you in here at
this hour."</p>

<p>"Straker, I crave for knowledge. Knowledge about Bessonia. Get
on with it."</p>

<p>The other looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Rather a new departure for you, isn't it? What do you want to
know about it? If the shooting is good, or what?"</p>

<p>"I want to know briefly, old lad, what the political situation
is there. I have just read in this rag&mdash;oh! it's one of yours,
is it&mdash;that a clash is imminent between the Royalist party and
the Industrial group. Why?"</p>

<p>Squire Straker sat down and began to fill an ancient pipe.</p>

<p>"If you are really interested, Tiny, I can give you the
situation in a nutshell. It is not at all complicated: it is a
situation which has occurred innumerable times in those small Latin
states in the past, and which will occur innumerable times in the
future. Political intrigue is as the breath of life to them, though
I am bound to say that in this case the matter is rather more
serious than usual. You probably don't remember that when the old
king died five years ago, there was a very large party in Bessonia
who were in favour of the place becoming a republic. The party was
led by a gentleman named Berendosi, who is an extremely able
man&mdash;possibly the ablest they've got. And had that party had
its way Berendosi would undoubtedly have been the first President.
Well&mdash;it didn't have its way, and the present bloke Peter
became king. But Berendosi is not the type of man to let trifles of
that sort deter him, and though he was defeated in the first round
he was by no manner of means knocked out. He went on working and
plotting behind the scenes, until he got a severe jolt in the
second round too. That was when the King got married. The Queen, as
you probably know, is a most divinely pretty creature, and she
absolutely knocked the entire population endways. They raved about
her, and Peter's stock soared sky high. Never had he been so
popular: never had his position seemed more secure. And Berendosi
looked on, smiling behind his hand. Only too well did he know his
own countrymen: only too well did he know the rapidity with which
the pendulum swings with people of their temperament. He could
afford to bide his time. A word here, a hint there: a rumour spread
and then contradicted&mdash;but by that time the damage was done.
And so it went on, like drops of water wearing away a stone, until
a new and completely unexpected development took place about three
months ago. Am I boring you?"</p>

<p>"Very far from it," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Up to that time the hints and innuendoes started by Berendosi
and his group had been entirely political. You know the sort of
thing I mean&mdash;that So-and-So was accepting bribes: that the
King was grossly extravagant: that the people were being overtaxed
in order that corrupt ministers might line their pockets. And then,
as I say, came the change. It was done very gradually, and at first
our correspondent out there&mdash;who by the way is an extremely
able man&mdash;disregarded it. But after a time he could do so no
longer: the rumours became so persistent. And though they varied in
small details the main gist was the same: the Queen was being
unfaithful to her husband."</p>

<p>Tiny Carteret sat up with a jerk: then sank back in his chair
again.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Now you can see at once," continued Straker, "the vast
importance of the move. The Industrial party&mdash;which is another
name in that country for the Republican party&mdash;and Berendosi
do not care the snap of a finger if she is unfaithful or if she
isn't. But the other party&mdash;the Royalist party&mdash;would
literally be split from top to bottom if it were proved that she
was. In fact Berendosi would have obtained everything he wants. The
cement binding the Royalist party together, is the beauty and the
home life and all the rest of it of the King and Queen. Once that
cement was removed: once the rumour was proved true the party would
simply disintegrate."</p>

<p>"And do you think it is true?" asked Tiny slowly.</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The King is not a particularly prepossessing specimen," he
answered. "And Queens are no different to ordinary women except
that considerably more publicity surrounds their lives. No, Tiny: I
can't tell you&mdash;I don't know. All I can tell you is that if
the rumour becomes currently believed, it doesn't matter whether
it's the truth or whether it isn't: the result will be the same. It
may take longer&mdash;but in the end Berendosi will win. Of course,
were it possible to prove such a thing&mdash;spectacularly, which
as far as I can see it isn't, why then..."</p>

<p>Again he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What then?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Well, it wouldn't be a question of in the end. The thing would
be over in an hour, and one would never be surprised with people of
the Bessonian temperament if the punishment awarded the erring lady
was short and drastic. No, Tiny&mdash;that would be a very serious
matter. We do not want Berendosi in power there for many reasons
into which I haven't got time to go now. And as long as the matter
remains in the region of rumour I don't think we shall have
Berendosi in power. But if by some unfortunate chance that girl has
been indiscreet, and Berendosi holds proof of it&mdash;proof which
would carry conviction to the masses&mdash;it's all up. He is just
biding his time now, and preparing the ground. Then when he's
ready, he'll strike."</p>

<p>He finished his drink and rose.</p>

<p>"So long, old boy: this is the hour when my chief labour
commences."</p>

<p>He shambled out of the room like a great bear, leaving Tiny
staring thoughtfully out of the window. And such is the
constitution of the human mind that it was not problems of high
politics in the Near East that occupied the latter's thoughts, but
something very much more personal. Why had not Gillson told him all
this at lunch? That Squire Straker should be in possession of
information unknown to Gillson was absurd. Gillson must have known
all about these rumours, but not a word had he said. And Tiny began
to feel irritated. He had all the independent man's dislike of
being kept in the dark. Surely if he was a fit and proper person to
play at all, the least he could expect was to be given full
information. Why should he be used as a cat's paw? And then as
suddenly as his irritation had arisen, it evaporated. Gillson's
words in his office that morning recurred to him.</p>

<p>"There are certain occasions when real genuine ignorance is
worth untold gold."</p>

<p>Presumably this had been one of them. Not only was he to be kept
in the dark as to what was going to happen to himself on the other
side, but also as to what was happening to other people. Yet,
surely it would have been better had he known the rumours before he
went round to see Mary. He could have asked her point blank: he
could have...</p>

<p>And what would have been the result? He lit a cigarette
thoughtfully, and a faint smile twitched round his lips. What would
have been the result? Nothing: a flat denial. He knew Mary well
enough for that, and so apparently did that darned fellow Gillson.
Had he gone round there evidently bursting with official
information, Mary would have shut up like an oyster. And so Gillson
had deliberately sent him round to see her full of genuine
ignorance, in the hope that she would turn to him for help. The
problem that occupied Straker occupied Gillson too. Was there any
definite proof of the rumour in existence? That is what he had been
sent to find out, and that is what he had not succeeded in finding
out.</p>

<p>At least, not for certain. That Squire Straker's information was
of vital importance he realized. It provided a central peg on which
the whole thing hung together connectedly. There <i>was</i> proof
in existence, and Felton Blake held it. And Mary <i>was</i> acting
on behalf of the Queen to get it back. The other
difficulties&mdash;the private room in the Fifty-Nine, the motor
drive which the two had taken together&mdash;seemed capable of
explanation once that central fact was conceded. They were trifles
compared with the main thing.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch: five minutes to eight. What was he
going to say to Gillson over the telephone? He had no proof: only a
strong intuition. He might be wrong&mdash;wildly wrong. He might be
jumping to the most absurd conclusion. And yet, once granted Mary
herself was not the victim, which was even more absurd, what other
possible conclusion was there?</p>

<p>He was still undecided as he called up Sloane 1234: still
undecided when he heard Gillson's deep voice from the other
end.</p>

<p>"Nothing for certain, Colonel," he said.</p>

<p>"We can't always deal in certainties, Carteret, in our trade.
Did you find out anything at all?"</p>

<p>He answered with another question.</p>

<p>"Do you know Squire Straker by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do." Gillson seemed surprised. "Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"I've just been having a long talk with him over the state of
affairs in a certain country."</p>

<p>Was it Tiny's imagination, or did a very faint chuckle come from
the other end of the wire?</p>

<p>"Have you indeed? I hope you were interested."</p>

<p>"I think you might have been a little more explicit, Colonel, at
lunch to-day."</p>

<p>"Possibly, Carteret. But don't forget it is still only in the
rumour stage. The point, however, now is this. What opinion, if
any, have you arrived at?"</p>

<p>Tiny weighed his words carefully.</p>

<p>"I believe that your conjecture is right. I believe that the
lady is acting for someone whose name I won't mention. But it's
only belief: I haven't a vestige of proof."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, my dear fellow, we're moving in deep waters; and
unless I'm much mistaken you shortly will be moving in deeper ones.
Good night and good luck to you."</p>

<p>Tiny replaced the receiver, and went back to the smoking-room. A
bunch of members hailed him as he came in, but he was in no mood
for club back-chat. He wanted to get things straightened out in his
mind; so making some excuses he went into the coffee-room and
ordered dinner. And during his solitary meal he attempted the
straightening process, though it would be idle to pretend he got
very far with it.</p>

<p>The whole affair was such a complete upheaval, and such an
extremely rapid one. In the course of twelve hours he had been
transported from the even tenor of his ways and landed in the
centre of an atmosphere of murder and blackmail. And one of his
companions was Mary. That was the most staggering part of the whole
business: Mary mixed up with such a bunch! It seemed incredible:
almost as incredible as it would have seemed to him this morning if
someone had told him he was going to propose to her.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it; he had done so. And now he tried to
think how he would be feeling if she hadn't turned him down. To
depart from the habits of a lifetime and propose to a girl was
clear proof of what an upheaval had taken place. And yet he wasn't
at all certain that he had wanted to be turned down. Mary was
unquestionably a darling, and that kiss she had given him....</p>

<p>"Give me my bill," he said savagely: the thought of Mary alone
in a private room with any man, let alone Felton Blake, had
suddenly become unspeakable.</p>

<p>"I'll write her," he reflected, as he strolled back to his
rooms. "Write her to-night, and tell her I meant it. That it wasn't
a spasm induced by a desire to help her."</p>

<p>And because he was very busy with his thoughts, he failed to
notice a man who was lingering aimlessly not far from his front
door, and who vanished rapidly as he entered. Nor could he possibly
have known that shortly afterwards the man expended the sum of
twopence on a telephone call to Hampstead.</p>

<p>He sat down at his desk, and pulled a sheet of paper towards
him. From the next room came the sound of Murdoch finishing his
packing, and for awhile he remained motionless, gnawing the end of
his penholder. Then he began to write.</p>

<p class="letter">MARY DEAR&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Ever since I saw you this afternoon I've been
feeling distracted. I <i>know</i> you're in trouble; I <i>know</i>
I could help you if only you would let me. You pulled my leg about
proposing to you, but believe me, Mary, I meant it. I know I'm
every sort and condition of an ass, while you're just&mdash;Mary.
No need to say more. I think I've always loved you, dear: but it
was seeing you up against it to-day that made me cough it up.</p>

<p class="letter">However, let all that be for the time. Can't I do
anything to help? Please let me. You can tell me as much or as
little as you like: I'll go into it blind if it's for you. This
letter should arrive first post to-morrow, and if you telephone me
on its receipt I'll cancel all my arrangements with regard to
Switzerland. Or a letter to the Ouchy Palace Hotel at Lausanne will
bring me back at once. One can get through in a day, and if
necessary I can always fly.</p>

<p class="letter">Mary dear, I beg of you to think very deeply. Are
you being wise trying to tackle this business&mdash;whatever it
is&mdash;alone? Can't I help you? I know I'm repeating myself, but,
my dear, I do feel so terribly strongly about it. We've played a
lot together in the past, Mary: we've always been damned good pals.
And if you can't turn to a pal when you're up against it, it's a
pretty hopeless state of affairs.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours ever, my dear one, TINY.</p>

<p>He re-read it: then slipped it into an envelope and stamped
it.</p>

<p>"Murdoch," he called out, "take this out and post it at
once."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir: and the packing is practically finished."</p>

<p>The man withdrew, and Tiny flung himself into a chair and lit a
cigarette. Would the letter have any effect, or would she still go
on playing the hand alone? And even as he asked himself the
question there came the faint purring of an engine through the open
window. He rose idly, and crossing the room, looked out. Drawn up
by the kerb was a yellow Rolls limousine with an aluminium
bonnet.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," he muttered. "Things move."</p>

<p>The door opened behind him and he swung round. Standing in the
entrance was Felton Blake.</p>

<p>For a moment or two they eyed one another in silence: then Tiny
spoke.</p>

<p>"May I ask who you are, and what you are doing here?"</p>

<p>"I think you already know who I am, Mr. Carteret," answered the
other. "But to prevent any possibility of error I will introduce
myself. My name is Blake."</p>

<p>"How did you get in?" said Tiny curtly.</p>

<p>"I walked through a door which your man had considerately left
open."</p>

<p>"Then would you be good enough to walk out again, and pretty
damned quick at that."</p>

<p>Felton Blake put his hat and gloves on a chair.</p>

<p>"You disappoint me, Mr. Carteret," he said suavely. "I thought
you were sufficiently a man of the world not to adopt such a
foolish attitude. It can lead us nowhere, and I have come round
here expressly to have a talk with you."</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest wish to talk to you in any place or at
any time," said Tiny icily.</p>

<p>"I can't say from the standard of your conversation," answered
Blake, "that I have much desire to talk to you either. But
sometimes these boring entertainments become regrettable
necessities."</p>

<p>Tiny mastered his anger, which was rapidly rising: it occurred
to him that up to date he had not shone in the interview.</p>

<p>"It would be interesting to know what possible necessity there
can be for a conversation between you and me," he remarked.</p>

<p>"That sounds a little better," said Blake. "And since this isn't
a stage melodrama&mdash;shall we sit down?</p>

<p>"As you like. There is a chair. I prefer to stand."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Carteret&mdash;I must ask you for an explanation. You
called on Lady Mary Ridgeway this afternoon, did you not?"</p>

<p>Once again Tiny began to see red.</p>

<p>"Give you an explanation," he cried. "Why the devil should
I?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly there is no reason at all," said the other suavely,
"if you had confined yourself to calling. But it becomes a
different matter when, during your call, you slander me. I
understand that you alluded to me as a notorious blackmailer."</p>

<p>Tiny stood very still: that Mary would pass on his remarks to
Blake was a development he had not anticipated.</p>

<p>"I am waiting, Mr. Carteret, for an explanation&mdash;and an
apology."</p>

<p>And suddenly it dawned on Tiny that the position was undeniably
awkward. The man confronting him, as Gillson had said, might have
been a successful lawyer: certainly he looked the acme of
respectability.</p>

<p>"You have proof, of course, of your astounding statement,"
continued Blake.</p>

<p>Which was exactly what Tiny had not got.</p>

<p>"You seem very silent, Mr. Carteret. Come, sir, I insist on an
explanation."</p>

<p>"No explanation is necessary for speaking the truth," said Tiny,
lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"So you adhere to it," remarked the other softly. "And your
proof?"</p>

<p>"Is there any good in prolonging this discussion, Mr. Blake,"
answered Tiny. "It bores me excessively. Of proof in the accepted
sense of the word I have none. Nevertheless I repeat my assertion:
you are a notorious blackmailer. And there is the door."</p>

<p>"Not quite so fast, my young friend," snarled the other. "Have
you ever heard of the law of libel?"</p>

<p>"Cut it out, you poor fish," laughed Tiny. "As a bluff that is
unworthy of a child of ten. You go into a law court to defend your
lily-white character! I think not, Mr. Blake&mdash;somehow.
Besides, where is your own proof? Even you would hardly ask Lady
Mary to go into the witness-box, I presume."</p>

<p>For a moment Blake was silent: in a sudden fit of rage he had
put up a bluff, and no one knew better than he that the bluff had
been called successfully. Some other line would have to be adopted
with this very direct young man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carteret," he said, "you are perfectly right. Nothing, of
course, would induce me to ask Lady Mary to do such a thing. At the
same time I think you will agree that it is a little disconcerting,
when I am doing my best to help her over some extremely ticklish
negotiations, for me to be libelled in such a way."</p>

<p>"Leaving out the question of libel for the moment, Mr. Blake,
may I ask the nature of these negotiations?"</p>

<p>"I regret that I am not at liberty to pass that on," answered
Blake.</p>

<p>"Leaving that out too then for the moment, I would be greatly
obliged if you would tell me why it is necessary to take her to
such an impossible place as a private room at the Fifty-Nine
Club?"</p>

<p>Felton Blake eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Your information is good, Mr. Carteret."</p>

<p>"Damn my information," cried Tiny angrily. "What I want to know
is how you dare compromise a girl in her position by doing such a
thing."</p>

<p>Blake raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Dare! Rather a strong word. You don't suppose, do you, that I
dragged her there against her will? Nor can you really suppose that
with her knowledge of the world she didn't know what she was
doing."</p>

<p>"I refuse to believe that she went there willingly," said Tiny
doggedly.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you so?" asked Blake quietly. "No: I see she
didn't. Mr. Carteret&mdash;I am going to put my cards on the
table."</p>

<p>"How many of them?" said Tiny with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"All that I can," answered the other. "As I said before, your
information is good. Moreover, I can hazard a pretty shrewd guess
as to its source. That, however, is neither here nor there. To be
brief then, I am not acting, as you seem to suppose, against Lady
Mary: I am acting on her behalf. I too have sources of information
at my disposal, and it so happens that I am in a position where I
may be able to render her a considerable service. But in order to
do so it is essential that she and I should be left&mdash;if I may
put it that way&mdash;in peace. Come, Mr. Carteret&mdash;I'm going
to ask you a straight question. Your information came from Colonel
Gillson, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to say who it came from," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"And he sent you round to Lady Mary to find out what you
could?"</p>

<p>"You seem to have everything cut and dried," remarked Tiny.</p>

<p>"Now I solemnly warn you and him as well that any outside
interference at the moment may prove fatal. I speak in all
earnestness. I am, believe me, on your side, and I therefore beg of
you to remember what I say. If you don't, the consequences will be
on your head&mdash;and on Lady Mary's."</p>

<p>Tiny stared at him thoughtfully: on the face of it the man was
sincere. And yet...</p>

<p>"Touching the little matter of the waiter who was murdered," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Mr. Carteret, that I have never been more
surprised in my life than when Lady Mary told me about it." He gave
a short laugh. "I hope in addition to being a blackmailer, I am not
suspected of that. Because, unfortunately for your kindly
suggestion, I have a perfect alibi."</p>

<p>"When did Lady Mary tell you I had been to see her?"</p>

<p>"She rang me up as soon as you left: you had alarmed her so
much. Hence my visit to you to-night. Mr. Carteret&mdash;I beg of
you be guided by me in this matter. The issues are altogether too
serious."</p>

<p>He rose, and glancing through the open door into Tiny's bedroom
he saw the half-packed suitcases.</p>

<p>"You're going out of Town?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Didn't Lady Mary tell you that also?" said Tiny
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"No," returned the other. "Her mind was too much occupied with
other things."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Blake: I'm going out of Town. I'm going for a walking
tour&mdash;in Bessonia."</p>

<p>Just for an instant Felton Blake stood as if carved out of
stone. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Bessonia," he said. "A most interesting country. I trust you
will have a good time. Good night, Mr. Carteret; I have enjoyed our
chat greatly."</p>

<p>He went down the stairs and crossed the pavement to his car. He
had given his chauffeur the night off, and now he felt rather
relieved that he had done so. For Felton Blake was one of those men
who could concentrate better when quite alone. Why on earth had
Lady Mary said nothing to him about this trip to Bessonia? And was
there any special significance in it? For Gillson's knowledge of
all sorts and conditions of things he had the most profound
respect, and his reason for sending Carteret round to see her was
clear in view of the friendship between them. But surely if he
suspected anything he would not send an untried man like that to
Bessonia. Anyway, what could he do? What could anyone do? The thing
was fool-proof as far as he could see: moreover it was within the
law.</p>

<p>Felton Blake smiled gently to himself. The soft purr of the
engine soothed him with its hundred per cent efficiency&mdash;he
liked efficiency because it engendered success. And success was his
god. The means by which it was attained mattered nothing: the fact
that at the moment he was engaged in driving one of the most
infamous bargains a man can drive troubled him not at all. The only
thing that concerned him was whether he had bluffed Tiny Carteret
sufficiently.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that his interview with Lady Mary had caused
him a distinct shock. Even he had not suspected that the
information on the other side was as good as it evidently was. And
one point struck him as being so important that it would have to be
cleared up. Was it he personally who was being watched&mdash;or was
it the Fifty-Nine Club? And since so far as he knew there was no
reason why he should be honoured with such an attention, it rather
pointed to the latter as being correct. Which was annoying:
distinctly annoying. Almost as annoying as this extraordinary
murder of the waiter. For one of the few truthful remarks he had
made in his interview with Carteret had been when they talked about
it.</p>

<p>He had been absolutely amazed when Lady Mary had told him about
it. At first, in fact, he had refused to believe it&mdash;had
assured her that she must be mistaken. And then when she had still
persisted he could only come to the conclusion that it was an
extraordinary coincidence. Unless....</p>

<p>He frowned slightly: the train of thought suggested by that word
did not please him. For if it was not a coincidence, it could only
mean one thing&mdash;the presence in England of the last man he
wanted to see at the moment. And even then it was hard to
understand. Why should he have murdered an inoffensive waiter?</p>

<p>He ran the car into his garage: then he let himself into his
house. And the first thing he saw was a black Homburg hat lying on
the hall table. For a moment he stood very still: that hat was the
answer to the question. His "unless" had been justified.</p>

<p>He opened the door of his study and went in. Seated in an easy
chair, smoking a cigarette, was a peculiar-looking individual. At
first sight he appeared to be a man of about forty, but on closer
inspection he might have been considerably more. He had a high
domed forehead rendered the more noticeable because of his absolute
lack of hair, and from beneath it there stared two unwinking blue
eyes. And to complete the picture, on his shoulder there sat a
small monkey which chattered angrily on Blake's entrance.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Zavier," said Blake. "This is an unexpected
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Susan," said the other in a curiously gentle voice.
"Don't you know our friend Felton by now?" He turned to Blake. "So
you are surprised at seeing me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were still at headquarters," remarked Blake.
"What brings you over here?"</p>

<p>"A desire to see you, my dear fellow, amongst other things. All
goes well?"</p>

<p>"Very well. Though I am bound to confess, Zavier, that the
intelligence of our English police has been sadly underrated. They
know too much."</p>

<p>"And to-day they would have known considerably more save for my
presence. You're a damned fool, Blake&mdash;and I have but little
use for damned fools. All I can say is&mdash;that I trust you stop
short at foolishness. Otherwise...."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Blake's lips were strangely dry.</p>

<p>"Is it conceivable," said the other, and his voice was softer
than ever, "that you did not realize that your waiter of last night
was a police spy?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Blake. "So it was you, then?</p>

<p>"Who removed him? Oh! yes&mdash;it was I who did that."</p>

<p>"But, why?" stammered Blake. "What was the object?"</p>

<p>"It was nothing to do, I assure you, with your conversation with
the young lady. There were one or two indiscretions, but nothing
sufficient to warrant such a drastic step as that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Blake slowly. "What do you know of my
conversation with Lady Mary?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I listened with interest to every word." Zavier
smiled faintly. "Charming! Charming! But I fear your suit does not
progress as rapidly as you wish."</p>

<p>At last Blake found his voice.</p>

<p>"You listened," he shouted angrily. "You cursed spy. Where did
you listen from?"</p>

<p>"You are exciting Susan again," remarked the other gently. "I
must really beg of you to control yourself."</p>

<p>He pacified the excited little animal, while Blake with a great
effort pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"There are secrets of mine, my dear Blake, that even you do not
know. And one of them concerns the private room so prettily
decorated with mauve orchids last night. A delightful girl,
Blake&mdash;delightful. But what a fool you are! Even should she be
insane enough to marry you, do you really think you would be happy?
The daughter of a Duke!"</p>

<p>"That's my affair," said Blake sullenly. "What I want to know is
how much you heard."</p>

<p>"It's just because your waiter happened to find out how I heard
that he died. So I fear your curiosity will not be gratified. You
were saying, however, that the English police know too much. What
precisely did you mean?"</p>

<p>"For one thing, they know that I have twice given supper to Lady
Mary at the Fifty-Nine."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what of it?" remarked the other. "It is not a
criminal offence. Though what obscure idea was at the bottom of
your mind in so doing is beyond me."</p>

<p>"I want to put her under a still greater obligation to me,"
explained Blake.</p>

<p>"My denseness must be pardoned," said Zavier, "but I confess I
do not quite follow."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if there was a police raid, it would be a bit
awkward for her."</p>

<p>"I see. You mean the next time you sup there, there <i>will</i>
be a police raid. A remarkably local police raid staged by Felton
Blake, and from the unfortunate consequences of which she will be
saved by Felton Blake." He began to laugh softly. "My God! what a
fool you are! However, if it amuses you that's all that matters. To
return to the point: what else do they know?"</p>

<p>"That man Gillson is wise to the fact that there is something in
the wind between Lady Mary and me."</p>

<p>"Somewhat naturally. My dear fellow, I don't want to be rude but
the Lady Marys of English society do not have supper with people
like you because they want to, but because they have to."</p>

<p>Felton Blake's face turned a deep red.</p>

<p>"Go to hell, Zavier," he snarled. "I'm sick of your damned
sneers. And here's one for you. I believe he suspects the
truth."</p>

<p>"So," said Zavier, pulling the monkey's ears, and staring at
Blake. "And what makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"He sent a man called Carteret, who is a great friend of Lady
Mary's, round to pump her this afternoon. Scared her out of her
life&mdash;especially over the murder of the waiter. I've just been
round to see him, and the last thing he said to me was that he was
going for a walking tour in Bessonia, and was starting
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is he?"</p>

<p>"A great big fellow. A Rugby international."</p>

<p>"Size matters but little," said Zavier gently, "should it be
necessary to remove him. I alluded more to his intelligence."</p>

<p>"Not very high, I should think." He was staring half fascinated
at the other man. "You'll fail, you know, one day, Zavier. Last
night was the fifth."</p>

<p>"One almost loses count," returned Zavier. "And as to failure,
Blake, the only being who never fails is the one who never tries.
But to come back to this man Carteret. If your description of him
is accurate, I don't think it matters if he takes a walking tour in
Bessonia or not."</p>

<p>"I didn't say it did," said Blake. "But it points to the fact
that Gillson suspects."</p>

<p>"What if he does? What we propose to do is strictly
constitutional." He rubbed his hands together. "Quite legal, in
fact."</p>

<p>"Have you any further information with regard to dates?"</p>

<p>"I was talking to Berendosi three days ago. He thinks in two or
possibly three months. By then he calculates that there will be no
one in Bessonia who won't have heard the rumour. And that will be
the time to spring the proof on them&mdash;or what they will regard
as the proof. It will also give him time to mature his own plans."
His shoulders began to shake silently. "What about yours, my
friend," he murmured. "It strikes me you will have to press forward
with your love-making."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Blake irritably.</p>

<p>"Just this. What little chance you have of being united in holy
matrimony to Lady Mary will assuredly vanish altogether when she
finds you've sold her a pup. To put it another way. It is within
the bounds of possibility that she might sacrifice herself to save
her friend; but it is completely off the map to think that she
would marry you once the revolution has taken place. That strikes
home, doesn't it, Blake? And so while we are on the subject, my
friend, I will tell you what I really came round here to say. From
one or two remarks I heard last night, it seemed to me that you are
in that condition of maudlin imbecility with regard to the girl
that one usually associates with a boy of eighteen. And when that
is combined with the passion of a man of your age the situation
becomes grave. Anything might happen. You might even, to attain
your desire, really do what you have told her you are going to do.
In which case, believe me, Blake, the honeymoon would not be of
long duration." His voice had dropped almost to a whisper. "As I
said&mdash;one almost loses count."</p>

<p>The unwinking blue eyes were fixed on Felton Blake, who
moistened his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid," he muttered. "I won't let you
down."</p>

<p>"Somehow or other I don't think you will," agreed Zavier, with a
short laugh.</p>

<p>He opened his case and extracted a thin Russian cigarette. It
was the only brand he ever smoked, and his daily allowance of ten
was as invariable as all his habits.</p>

<p>"By the way, Blake," he continued, "did you know that Standish
is in Switzerland?"</p>

<p>"How did you find out?" asked the other quickly.</p>

<p>"Various Continental papers have as you know the custom of
publishing the names of guests staying at the better hotels. He is
staying at the Grand Hotel at Territet."</p>

<p>"Has it any significance, do you think?" demanded Blake.</p>

<p>"My experience of Standish is that anything he does has a
certain significance. So I made a point of staying a week-end at
the hotel, where I had made one or two inquiries. He seems to be
just aimlessly putting through time there, and to put through time
aimlessly is not a characteristic of Standish. So I at once arrived
at the conclusion that he was doing nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Good God! do you think he's found out anything?"</p>

<p>"You mean as to where our cosy home is? To be quite frank with
you, Blake, the possibility had crossed my mind. But now, after
what you tell me about Gillson, I am almost inclined to think that
he may be there merely on the Bessonian question."</p>

<p>Felton Blake heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Then we needn't worry. On that point neither he nor anybody
else can do anything to interfere with us. But if he had found
headquarters..."</p>

<p>"He still has to get inside," remarked Zavier, pressing out his
cigarette. "And that as you know, my dear Blake, presents certain
difficulties. In fact to do it in safety without knowing how, is as
nearly impossible as a thing can be." He rose to his feet. "Well,
Susan&mdash;a little walk will be good for both of us."</p>

<p>"When do you return, Zavier?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. So possibly I shall travel with your friend
Carteret. Yes&mdash;I go back to-morrow. There are two or three big
deals maturing, which I want to get through before the business
with Berendosi. And on the Roumanian question I may require you. I
think you have a little private information concerning two members
of their cabinet which should prove useful. Well, good night, and
may the course of your young love run smooth."</p>

<p>And his faint mocking laugh was still echoing in Blake's ears,
long after the front door had banged behind him.</p>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AGE cannot wither nor custom stale the incredible
tedium of the journey from Calais to Paris. It is possible that for
those who are about to gaze on that most delectable of cities for
the first time the thrill of anticipation may suffice to tide them
over those three interminable hours. But for the rest&mdash;<i>on
s'ennui</i>.</p>

<p>Tiny was one of the rest. Normally he always flew to France, but
on this occasion he was not his own master. The day had started
badly, with a brief telephone message from Mary.</p>

<p>"My dear," she had said, "I adore your letter, and I'm not at
all sure I don't adore you. But you can't do anything, really you
can't. Now run along like a good boy or you'll miss your
train."</p>

<p>At that she had rung off, and when he tried to get through to
her again only her maid had answered. Then a grim visaged woman
using her dressing-case as a battering-ram winded him badly at
Victoria, and then glared at him furiously when he invoked Allah in
his agony. In fact, everything seemed to have gone wrong.</p>

<p>Half-way to Dover had found him already regretting that he had
ever left London. It seemed to him that if he went on badgering
Mary long enough, she would be bound to tell him what the trouble
was, and that therefore his place was near her and not flying about
Switzerland. That momentary look on Blake's face the previous
night, when he had drawn a bow at a venture and mentioned Bessonia,
had confirmed his opinion. That <i>was</i>the root of the whole
trouble, and he wished he had taxed her with it directly. Then she
might have spoken.</p>

<p>The train was slowing down for Amiens, when he threw aside his
paper and glanced round the Pullman. It was filled with the usual
cosmopolitan crowd, and he was just picking up a magazine when the
attendant handed him a note, scribbled in pencil and written
evidently while the train was in motion.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Carteret," it ran, "have you quite forgotten me? I am
sitting directly behind you, two chairs away. Nada Mazarin."</p>

<p>His brows wrinkled: who the devil was Nada Mazarin? Then he
turned round and looked at the writer who smiled, as she caught his
eye, and indicated the seat opposite her own which happened to be
free. Her face was small and <i>piquante</i>, and Tiny remembered
having caught a glimpse of her on the boat, and wondering vaguely
if he didn't know her. And the worst of it was, he couldn't place
her even now.</p>

<p>He rose at once and took the vacant seat.</p>

<p>"It is incredibly <i>gauche</i> of me to admit it," he said,
"but though I remember you perfectly, I cannot for the life of me
think when and where I had the pleasure of meeting you."</p>

<p>"You didn't see much of me, Mr. Carteret," she answered, with
only the faintest of foreign accents. "You and Mr. Denver made the
four with Lady Mary and&mdash;you know who."</p>

<p>Tiny leaned back in his chair: now he had got the whole
thing.</p>

<p>"Of course," he cried. "How infernally stupid of me not to
remember."</p>

<p>Countess Nada Mazarin&mdash;that was who it was. She had been
lady- in-waiting, or female of the bedchamber&mdash;Tiny was a bit
vague on the correct nomenclature in such matters&mdash;to Princess
Olga when she had been over in England three years ago. He recalled
her perfectly: he'd seen her several times at Claridges with the
Princess. And as she justly remarked she had been a bit left out of
things: the others had formed a square party.</p>

<p>"Lady Mary told me you were crossing to-day, so I wondered if by
chance we should go by the same service."</p>

<p>"And when did you see Lady Mary?" he asked, holding out his
cigarette-case to her.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said. "But please smoke yourself. I've seen
a lot of her during the few days I've been in London."</p>

<p>Tiny looked at her thoughtfully: proof seemed to be mounting on
proof.</p>

<p>"Should I be right in assuming that it was in order to see her
that you went to London?" he remarked.</p>

<p>Her face betrayed no surprise at his question.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much you know, Mr. Carteret," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"If what I knew depended on what Mary had told me," he remarked
a little bitterly, "it would be mighty little. To be truthful,
Countess, I <i>know</i> nothing. But I've guessed a good deal.
Come: won't you be frank with me. You know I'm to be trusted."</p>

<p>"It's not a question of that, my dear man," she answered
wearily. "Tell me&mdash;what have you guessed? From what Mary said
to me last night you seem to know a good deal about her
doings."</p>

<p>"I know," said Tiny grimly, "that she has been doing the most
amazingly injudicious things with a man who is a blackguard of the
first water."</p>

<p>"He's not as bad as that surely," she protested, her eyes
dilating.</p>

<p>"My dear Countess, personally I know nothing about the swine
except what I've been told. But, believe me, there are no flies on
my informant. You don't suppose, do you, that I even knew Mary had
been to the Fifty-Nine with the blighter. I was told it, and it was
the man who told me that, and a lot of other things too, who put me
wise as to Felton Blake's character."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Carteret, he's doing all he can for Mary."</p>

<p>Tiny gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Countess, your look belies you. You don't trust the blighter
any more than I do. If he's doing all he can for Mary, he's also
doing it for himself at the same time. And that's what I can't get
the hang of&mdash;having guessed, shall we put it, as much as I
have." He leaned across the table towards her. "Let's quit this
beating about the bush. Mary is acting for someone whose name we
won't mention, isn't she?"</p>

<p>She gave an almost imperceptible nod.</p>

<p>"I thought so." Tiny sat back in his chair; it was a relief to
have absolute confirmation at last. "I was sure of it. But why the
dickens Mary couldn't tell me herself is what beats me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blake is doing all he can for her," said the Countess alter
a pause.</p>

<p>"That's one point in the gentleman's favour anyway. Though from
what I've heard of him, I should never have expected him to be so
altruistic."</p>

<p>For perhaps half a minute she stared out of the window in
silence: then she suddenly turned to him.</p>

<p>"Why should you assume that he is being altruistic?" she said
slowly.</p>

<p>"You mean he's going to make her pay? Well, it's quite in
keeping with the blighter's character. And if Mary is in want of
money, there are stacks of her pals who will rally round the old
flag."</p>

<p>"You're dense, my friend," said his companion. "Money isn't the
only method of paying."</p>

<p>For a moment or two Tiny stared at her blankly: then, as her
meaning got home he half rose from his chair.</p>

<p>"But, good God!" he stuttered, "you're mad. It's impossible.
It's ... it's ... an outrage on decency. You mean that Mary
might&mdash;might marry that&mdash;that excrescence! You're
joking."</p>

<p>"I don't say she will, Mr. Carteret," she said gently. "But, if
I'm any judge of human nature, that is what he is working for."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's a different matter." Tiny sat back relieved. "Jove!
but you gave me a shock, Countess. And why should you think that's
his game?"</p>

<p>"I've seen them together," she answered. "I've seen him looking
at her when he thought he was unobserved, and a score of little
things like that."</p>

<p>"The insolent blackguard," fumed Tiny. "Of course she knows
nothing about it?"</p>

<p>"If you mean by that, that he hasn't said anything to
her&mdash;quite right. But Mary is very much a woman, my
friend."</p>

<p>"You mean, she's guessed what he's up to?"</p>

<p>"Is there any woman in the world who doesn't guess a thing like
that? Though, mind you, she's said nothing to me about it."</p>

<p>"But you aren't hinting, are you, that there's a possibility of
Mary agreeing?" he cried, aghast.</p>

<p>And once again she stared out of the window before she
replied.</p>

<p>"Supposing that was the only price he would accept," she said at
length.</p>

<p>"Surely there is no man living who could be such a swine," he
muttered. "And surely," he went on slowly, "there is no one living
who could ask such a sacrifice of another person."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," she answered quietly. "And if things
were quite as obvious as they seem to us, there would be a great
deal of justification in your remark. The someone whose name we
won't mention has no inkling of that side of the case. Nor had I
till I came over this time."</p>

<p>"Then you must tell that someone, Countess," said Tiny gravely.
"At once: the instant you get back."</p>

<p>"Tell her what, my friend? Believe me, it isn't quite so easy as
it appears to you. As I told you, Mary has said nothing to me. All
I have to go on is my own intuition. And supposing Mary laughed the
whole idea to scorn. She's loyal to the core, you know, and she
loves that someone dearly."</p>

<p>"You mean she might deliberately sacrifice herself," said Tiny,
and his voice was low. "Good God! There must be some other way out.
Can't you tell me, Countess, what the trouble is? Damn it! I might
think of some alternative: I'm not an absolute fool."</p>

<p>She shook her head wearily.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Mr. Carteret, there is absolutely nothing you or
anyone else can do. Except this man Blake. He is literally our only
hope. You see it's not a question of brawn and muscle, or even of
brain. It's a question of being in touch with certain people, of
having certain inside information. And only he possesses it. <i>Mon
Dieu!</i>" she put her hand to her forehead. "I think I shall go
distracted at times. One feels so utterly helpless&mdash;like a fly
in a spider's web. And the spider is sitting there, just biding its
time."</p>

<p>"Ah! Countess, what a delightful surprise. I had no idea that
you were on the train."</p>

<p>A thick-set man with an aquiline nose had paused beside their
table.</p>

<p>"Nor I, that you were, Signor."</p>

<p>The new-comer turned a pair of shrewd eyes on Tiny, and
deliberately studied him before replying.</p>

<p>"You have had a good time in London, I trust?" he said
suavely.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered. "London at this time of the year is
always delightful."</p>

<p>He lingered for a few moments shooting little quick glances at
Tiny between each platitude: then he moved on into his own
coach.</p>

<p>"How very funny, <i>mon ami</i>," said the Countess, "that I
should have been speaking about the spider just then. For that man
is the spider himself."</p>

<p>"Indeed," cried Tiny. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A man called Berendosi," she answered. "The most implacable
enemy of our someone that exists. But I don't suppose you have ever
heard of him."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Countess: I have. You know," he added with a
smile, "I am not quite so ignorant of affairs in other countries as
the average Englishman is always reputed to be."</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know what he's been doing in
England," she said thoughtfully. "I suppose," she gave a little
laugh, "you wouldn't like to perform a thoroughly meritorious
action and drop the brute out of the window!"</p>

<p>"He looks the irrepressible type who would bounce back," he
answered with a smile. "Hullo! we're nearly there. Now, look here,
Countess, will you promise me one thing? If you should find that I
can be of the smallest assistance&mdash;and you never know, I might
be&mdash;will you drop me a line to the Ouchy Palace Hotel,
Lausanne. I'll make arrangements to get it with a minimum of delay
whether I'm in Lausanne or not."</p>

<p>"I promise," she said. "And don't take what I said about Mary
too seriously. I may be completely wrong."</p>

<p>But that was just what it was impossible for him to do. As he
drove to Philippes it rang in his brain: as he sat in the empty
restaurant the thought kept dancing through his mind till it almost
seemed to be written on the cloth in front of him. Mary married to
Blake! Mary married to Blake!</p>

<p>It was inconceivable: hideous: monstrous. And yet as he forced
himself to think it over dispassionately he had to admit that even
stranger <i>mésalliances</i> had taken place. The man at any rate
looked a gentleman, and he had plenty of money. And then he
recalled the expression on her face when she had passed him in the
Rolls.</p>

<p>He ordered another Martini and lit a cigarette. That settled it.
There could be no willingness on the part of a girl who looked like
that. Quite obviously she disliked the man intensely. And that
being the case she was not going to marry him even if it
necessitated killing Blake with his own hands.</p>

<p>He shook himself angrily: what the devil was the use of thinking
along those lines? You can't go running round London murdering
people whose proposed nuptials you disapprove of. And if Mary had
made up her mind, he knew the futility of trying to dissuade her.
Besides, she would probably do it at a registrar's office and no
one would know anything about it till it was all over.</p>

<p>The room was beginning to fill up, but Tiny hardly noticed it,
so engrossed was he in his own thoughts. He ordered dinner
automatically, and ate it scarcely conscious of what the dishes
were. Which was manifestly unfair to superlative cooking. And it
was not until the coffee and brandy were in front of him that he
suddenly remembered that someone was to meet him there. This
ghastly question of Mary had driven everything else out of his
head.</p>

<p>He glanced round the restaurant: every table was full. And
certainly no one that he could see looked in the very slightest
degree like the possible bearer of a message. He was the only
solitary diner present: all the other tables had parties. He looked
at his watch: half-past eight. In a few minutes he would have to
start for the station.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Carteret?"</p>

<p>A waiter was standing by his table, and Tiny nodded.</p>

<p>"A note for M'sieur."</p>

<p>He took the envelope from the tray, and for a moment or two he
hesitated. Should he open it at once, or wait till he got in the
taxi? And then he realized that if by any chance he was being spied
on it would seem far more natural to do the former.</p>

<p>Inside was a sheet of paper on which was scrawled a single
sentence.</p>

<p>"Tell R.S. that D. is being shadowed."</p>

<p>He looked round the neighbouring tables: no one seemed to be
paying any attention to him. Then he beckoned the waiter.</p>

<p>"Who gave you this note?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"A gentleman who came to the door, M'sieur. He just looked in
and when he saw you he gave me the note."</p>

<p>"Right, thank you. Give me my bill, please."</p>

<p>He tore the message into tiny pieces and dropped them in his
coffee cup. The R.S. obviously referred to Ronald Standish, but who
D. was he had no idea. Presumably Ronald would, however, and having
poured some more coffee over the scraps of paper to obliterate them
still further, he rose and left.</p>

<p>It was in the taxi that he suddenly remembered Gillson's remark
about the sleeper, and he began to wonder why the temporary
possession of Number 8 bunk was going to fill him with gloom and
despondency. Presumably it must have something to do with the
occupant of Number 7, and he groaned mentally. The night was hot,
and the thought of being cooped up with some odoriferous male was
not pleasant. Still his orders were quite definite, though as it
happened they proved to be unnecessary. For when he got to the
station he found that the train was crowded and every other berth
in the coach was full. But of the possessor of Number 7 there was
no sign.</p>

<p>He tipped the porter, and then got out and stood on the
platform. The usual bunches of people seeing off others stood
chattering in little groups under the glare of the arc lights, and
Tiny watched them idly. There were two or three obvious English
people, but for the most part they consisted of French or Italians.
Two monks in brown cowls paced gravely up and down, and he wondered
what their particular order was. And then just as he was beginning
to hope that for once Gillson's arrangements had miscarried, and
that he was going to have the compartment to himself, a strange
trio advanced along the platform.</p>

<p>The centre one of the three was being, if not supported, at any
rate helped by the other two, and a terrible premonition of
impending doom assailed Tiny. And the next moment it ceased to be a
premonition&mdash;it became a certainty: the trio had stopped at
the entrance to the sleeper. Then one man pushed and another
pulled, and the centre one shot inside. The occupant of Number 7
had arrived.</p>

<p>Breathing a short invocation to Heaven to give him strength to
bear his cross, Tiny entered the carriage and walked along the
corridor to his compartment. And what he saw shook him to the
marrow. The gentleman reclining on Number 7 would have shaken
anyone to the marrow.</p>

<p>He was a fat puffy-looking individual of about forty, with a
greasy unhealthy complexion. At the moment he was breathing hard,
and his eyes were roving wildly from side to side like those of a
frightened rabbit. He was making periodical remarks in a language
unknown to Tiny, and one of his companions was answering him in the
same tongue. The third man looked and evidently was an
Englishman.</p>

<p>It was he who first saw Tiny, and he grinned slightly.</p>

<p>"Had to make him a bit screwed, or we'd never have got him
here," he said, joining Tiny in the corridor. "Still, he'll sleep
all the better."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that, anyway," Tiny grunted.</p>

<p>"He's scared out of his life," muttered the man. "And I don't
wonder. Not sorry to be shot of this show myself."</p>

<p>"I suppose you realize that I haven't the slightest idea what
you are talking about," said Tiny.</p>

<p>The man stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he cried. "Ain't you... Hullo! Train's off. Hop it,
Jim."</p>

<p>They scrambled on to the platform, leaving Tiny gazing moodily
at his bedfellow. And the more he gazed the less he liked it. So
far as he could see the gentleman had no redeeming feature. At the
same time, in view of what Gillson had said, he was evidently one
of the pawns in the game, though where he fitted in it was
impossible to say.</p>

<p>The arrival of the attendant settled one point: he, too, was
going to Lausanne. Moreover, he was going in his own fashion. Not
for him the comparative comfort of pyjamas and sheets, but
something far more primitive. He did, it is true, remove his shoes,
having first, with great difficulty, shut the window. Then, swaying
slightly, he turned a rather glazed eye on Tiny and pointed to the
top bunk.</p>

<p>Assuming that he was asking a question Tiny shook his head and
pointed to the lower. But that apparently was not what he wanted.
Still continuing to point at the bunk with one hand, he beckoned to
Tiny with the other.</p>

<p>"Come," he ejaculated solemnly. "Come."</p>

<p>"Oh! you want me to turn in, do you," said Tiny. "Well, laddie,
we're going to have the window open whether you like it or
not."</p>

<p>He entered the compartment, and the instant he was inside the
man shut and bolted the door. Then he bolted the door into the
washing-place, made a strange grunting noise which Tiny took to
mean good-night, collapsed on the lower berth and began to breathe
stertorously.</p>

<p>But not for long: the sound of Tiny opening the window
galvanized him into frenzied activity. He sprang off the bed
pouring out a flood of unintelligible words, and shut it again.
Then gesticulating wildly he turned to Tiny, and said "No" with
great distinctness six times. After which effort he fell down.</p>

<p>"Yes, but look here," said Tiny, when he'd helped him to his
feet, "there's not an atom of air in the carriage. <i>Pas de l'air.
Fenêtre. Ouvrir. Insanitaire. Oui. Non.</i>"</p>

<p>"No. No. No," answered the man. "Danger."</p>

<p>"Rot," cried Tiny angrily. "You can't have the window shut on a
hot night like this."</p>

<p>But the man had collapsed on his bunk again, still repeating No
at intervals, and Tiny stared at him nonplussed. He knew that by
the regulations for all railways abroad, the man was within his
rights in insisting on having the window shut. He also knew that
despite all those regulations he was going to have it open. Already
the carriage was becoming stuffy and airless, and to go all through
the night in such an atmosphere was a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>And then he had an idea. The man was half tight: once he was
asleep nothing would be likely to wake him. So he hoisted himself
carefully into the top bunk, and began to undress. From below came
the gentle music of the sleeper, but he decided to give it a little
longer. So he lit a cigarette, and opened a magazine. But after ten
minutes he felt he could stand it no more. He carefully inspected
his companion in the mirror, and having listened to his snores for
a while he decided the time was ripe. With great caution he
descended to the floor: in a moment the window was open.
And&mdash;the sleeper still slept.</p>

<p>Tiny returned to his berth, and shortly began to yawn himself.
And being one of those fortunate individuals who can sleep soundly
in a train, he soon switched out the lights, leaving only the dim
blue one in the centre of the roof just above him burning.</p>

<p>Now, as has been said, Tiny Carteret was a man whose nerves were
just about as strong as a man's nerves may be. He had, like many of
us, suffered moments of intense fright during the war, and again
like most of us those moments had passed into the limbo of
forgotten things. But it is to be doubted if the thing that
happened in that sleeper some two hours afterwards will ever fade
from his mind.</p>

<p>At first he thought he was having a nightmare: in fact, such a
peculiar thing is the human brain that during the few seconds in
which it happened he very distinctly said to himself&mdash;"It's
that lobster." For suddenly a hand clutched his arm, and as he
opened his eyes he saw not six inches away the face of the man
below. Only the whites of his eyes were showing: his lips were
drawn back from his teeth in a hideous snarl. And in the eerie blue
light it seemed to him that he was looking at a skull.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man uttered a dreadful cry, which sounded to Tiny
like "Bazana." Then the face disappeared.</p>

<p>For what seemed an eternity Tiny lay there, with the sweat
pouring off him as if he was in a Turkish bath. Then with a great
effort he forced himself to switch on the lights. He leaned over
the edge of his bunk: the man was sprawling face downwards on the
floor. And instinctively Tiny knew he was dead.</p>

<p>He got down and turned him over. There was no doubt about it:
that strange word "Bazana" was the last he would ever utter. His
face was contorted with agony: his arms and legs were rigid. And
for a space Tiny stood looking at him dully, hardly able to realize
what had happened.</p>

<p>The whole thing was so astoundingly sudden, and Tiny's brain was
not at its best at the moment of waking. But at last he pulled
himself together and rang the bell for the attendant, who came
after a slight delay and tried the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," called Tiny. "<i>Entrez.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>C'est fermé, M'sieur.</i>"</p>

<p>Of course: the door had been locked. Tiny remembered now: the
dead man had locked it himself. He opened it and the conductor came
in.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he cried, as he noticed the body. Then he
drew back with a cry of horror as he saw that terrible distorted
face.</p>

<p>"<i>Qu'est-ce-que y est arrivé?</i>"</p>

<p>And Tiny could only shrug his shoulders helplessly. What was
there to say? Every symptom seemed to tally with Gillson's
description of the mysterious murders, but how was it possible in
this case? How could a man be murdered in a train travelling at
sixty miles an hour when he was locked into a sleeper? The thing
was incredible; preposterous.</p>

<p>The <i>chef du train</i> had arrived by this time, and after one
look at the body had departed rapidly to see if there was a doctor
on the train. As luck would have it there was, and two minutes
later he returned with a young Englishman.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he cried, "the poor devil must have been in absolute
torture before he died. What happened, sir?" He turned to Tiny.</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing," answered Tiny. "I was in the top bunk
and I was suddenly awakened by feeling his hand on my arm. His face
was convulsed with agony, and then he crashed to the floor. I
realized at once, of course, that he was dead. So I rang for the
attendant."</p>

<p>"You know him? Was he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"I've never seen him before in my life," said Tiny.</p>

<p>Once more the doctor stooped over the dead man, and suddenly he
gave a little exclamation.</p>

<p>"Hullo! I wonder what that mark is on his hand? It's been made
fairly recently."</p>

<p>Tiny bent down to look: sure enough on the back of the man's
right hand was a small puncture that looked as if it had been made
by a thorn. Further evidence: and yet&mdash;how could it be so?
Vaguely he heard the others talking: realized that the doctor in a
mixture of English and French was telling the <i>chef du train</i>
that nothing could be done: that the man was dead and that his body
had better be removed from the train at the next stop.</p>

<p>"Dijon," said the worried official, and then with the attendant
he lifted the body back on to the bunk and covered the ghastly face
with a blanket.</p>

<p>"What was the cause of it, do you think, doctor?" asked
Tiny.</p>

<p>"Without a post-mortem it is impossible to say," replied the
other. "But from what you tell me, taking into account the rapidity
of the thing and the contortion of the features, I should say that
almost certainly it is a case of advanced disease of the heart.
Look here," he went on, "I've got a carriage to myself, and I have
also got a spot of Scotch. You'd better come along with me, at any
rate as far as Dijon."</p>

<p>"I think I will," said Tiny. "It's shaken me a bit, I confess.
I'll put some clothes on."</p>

<p>"Right you are," cried the doctor. "I'll wait in the
corridor."</p>

<p>"Is it true that a poor fellow is dead?"</p>

<p>A deep voice from the doorway made them both swing round:
standing there was one of the monks Tiny had noticed on the
platform in Paris. His hands were clasped in front of him: the
brown cowl still covered his head.</p>

<p>"I regret to say that it is," said the doctor. "But, reverend
Father, he is not a pretty sight to look at."</p>

<p>"My son," answered the other, "one must learn to disregard the
outer shell, and pay attention only to the inner spirit."</p>

<p>He drew back the blanket, and for a while his lips moved
silently. Then having made the sign of the cross, as abruptly as he
had come, he vanished.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's grossly materialistic of me," said the doctor,
"but I'm blowed if I see what good that has done.
However&mdash;doubtless I'm wrong."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Tiny, getting into his coat, "do you think the
French authorities are likely to detain me at Dijon?"</p>

<p>He took his watch down from the hook: ten minutes to
twelve&mdash;not three hours since they had left. Dijon, so far as
he remembered, was about four and a half hours from Paris, and to
be shot out there in the middle of the night was not a pleasant
thought.</p>

<p>"I really don't see why they should," said the doctor. "You can
do no earthly good. Of course they may keep you there on some
formality. At the same time I should say the cause of death is
obvious. Heart, as I told you. Come along, if you're ready. A drink
will do us both good."</p>

<p>Tiny shut the door, and the attendant locked it at once. Then he
followed the doctor along the train, his brain buzzing with the
problem. What had happened? What could have happened? Had it not
been for the mark on the dead man's hand, he would have been
inclined to think that the doctor was right, and that death had
been due to natural causes. But now the coincidence was too
extraordinary. And yet how in Heaven's name had the poor devil been
got at?</p>

<p>A possibility struck him. Had he got up and gone along the
corridor for some reason? That would presuppose that the murderer
was lurking outside on the bare chance that such a thing would
happen. Unlikely&mdash;but at any rate it did present a
solution.</p>

<p>Another idea. Was it conceivable that this man had been one of
the users of the poison himself, and had been carrying with him
whatever it was that they employed to commit their murders. Then,
accidentally while he was asleep, he had run it into his own hand,
and being half drunk had not awakened when he did so? If so, the
implement would still be in the dead man's berth, or in one of his
pockets.</p>

<p>For awhile he debated whether he should say anything about it to
the doctor. And then it occurred to him that to suggest the
possibility of foul play could do no good, and might involve him in
extremely awkward complications. For on the face of it to the
ordinary outsider the only person who could have murdered the man
was himself.</p>

<p>No: it was impossible to say anything. All he could do was to
hope that the French authorities would come to the same conclusion
as the doctor, and attribute the man's death to natural causes. If
they didn't, and detained him for a post-mortem, he would have to
grin and bear it. As he reflected a little cynically, it would only
be in keeping with the whole state of affairs at the moment.</p>

<p>But luck proved to be in at Dijon. Fortunately for Tiny one of
the station officials spoke fluent English, and helped by the
doctor's professional opinion, they merely asked his name and
destination and then allowed him to proceed. But one thing of
interest did come to light. The dead man was a Russian named
Demeroff. And as Tiny got back into the train he wondered if he was
the man referred to as D. in the letter he had received at
Philippes. If so, the shadowing was pretty efficient...</p>

<p>There was no sign of Ronald Standish on the platform at
Lausanne, so he chartered a car and drove to the Ouchy Palace
Hotel. And there, as Gillson had said, he found that a room had
been reserved for him.</p>

<p>"There is a letter for you, sir," said the clerk. "Delivered by
hand."</p>

<p>It was from Ronald and was as terse as the one he had received
in Paris.</p>

<p>"Do not let Demeroff out of your sight. Mid-day&mdash;the
bar."</p>

<p>Tiny smiled grimly: it struck him that the writer would require
more than one cocktail when he heard the news.</p>

<p>"There was another gentleman coming, sir, I believe," said the
clerk inquiringly. "A Russian."</p>

<p>"I fear that he has been unavoidably detained," answered Tiny
quietly.</p>

<p>The morning passed slowly: try as he would he couldn't get the
thought of that ghastly distorted face out of his mind. And try as
he would he couldn't get any nearer to solving the problem of how
it had been done. Ronald's note knocked the bottom out of his
theory that the thing was accidentally self-administered, because
it seemed to show that the dead man had been on their side.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock precisely Ronald Standish came into the bar.
His face was expressionless, but Tiny knew by the way he walked
that his nerves were a little on edge.</p>

<p>"What's this, Tiny, I hear at the office? Demeroff not
come?"</p>

<p>"And I'm afraid he never will, Ronald. He died in the train last
night: his body is at Dijon."</p>

<p>For a moment or two Standish said nothing: then he
spoke&mdash;very deliberately.</p>

<p>"If," he remarked, "I ever did lose my temper, I would now swear
without repeating myself for five minutes. How did they get him?
Tell me exactly what happened."</p>

<p>He listened in silence while Tiny ran through everything from
the receipt of the note in Paris to the examination at Dijon.</p>

<p>"You assume they got him, Ronald," he said in conclusion. "So do
I, because of the mark in his hand. But if you can tell me how the
devil they did it I'll be much obliged."</p>

<p>"What time did you say it was when you looked at your watch?"
asked the other.</p>

<p>"Ten to twelve," said Tiny. "But what's that got to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"Everything," answered Standish quietly. "Oh! Tiny, Tiny, if
only we as a race, didn't like fresh air so much! Still, it can't
be helped."</p>

<p>"What can't be helped?" said Tiny peevishly. "You're not going
to tell me that he was murdered through the open window of a train
travelling at sixty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"No, old lad, I'm not. He was murdered through the open window
of a train standing stationary by a platform. All the fast
expresses on that line stop at Laroche half-way between Paris and
Dijon to change engines. It was then they got him. You were asleep
and so was he. And that's when the poison was inserted. He was a
bit drunk so the prick never woke him. And it wasn't until after
the train had started that the poison began to work."</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Tiny. "Then I'm responsible for the poor
devil's death. He said it was dangerous to open the window, but I
never dreamt he meant that."</p>

<p>"How should you?" answered Standish. "You needn't worry, Tiny:
he was a nasty piece of work, and it was only a question of time
before they got him. But, if only I could have seen him for five
minutes! You see, to put the matter in a nutshell, he was blowing
the gaff. I don't know how much Gillson has told you; anyway I'll
fill in the gaps later, but the man who was murdered last night was
a member of the gang we are after. And our people had got at him in
Paris. His journey here was simply and solely to split on his
former pals. From the note you got at Philippes our people realized
the danger. But naturally no one thought of the damned window."</p>

<p>"How did they get at him, Ronald? How was it done?"</p>

<p>"If I could tell you that, Tiny, I should have solved one
problem that is worrying us all. Obviously the man who did it got
out of his carriage at Laroche, saw his opportunity and seized it.
If the window had been shut, of course he couldn't have done
it."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Bazana. I wonder if there's any significance. Was he trying to
tell you something?"</p>

<p>"Quite possibly," said Tiny. "And don't forget that's only what
it sounded like to me. The poor blighter's teeth were clenched, and
with the noise of the train it may not have been that at all."</p>

<p>"Let's have another spot, Tiny. Because we've got to decide what
we're going to do. I hear incidentally that you agree with Gillson
and me that Lady Mary is acting as go-between."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" said Tiny with some surprise.</p>

<p>"I got a cable in code from Gillson yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, if we wanted any further confirmation I got it in the
Golden Arrow yesterday," said Tiny. "Do you by any chance know a
Countess Mazarin?"</p>

<p>"I know who you mean, though I don't know the lady
personally."</p>

<p>"Well, she admitted it to me. By God! Ronald," he went on
savagely, "something has got to be done to get Mary out of the
clutches of that excrescence Felton Blake. The Countess actually
told me that she thought he was in love with her."</p>

<p>Standish raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"He aims high," he remarked. "Still, I wouldn't be surprised if
you aren't right."</p>

<p>"Berendosi was on the train too," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"I heard he'd been in England. Lord! Tiny, I'm at a dead end."
He got up and started pacing up and down, his hands deep in his
trouser pockets. "If only Lady Mary or the Mazarin woman would tell
us what the mystery was! Though, to be perfectly frank, I don't
know that it would do us much good. They've got some form of
proof&mdash;faked or otherwise, it matters not&mdash;which they are
going to spring at the last moment."</p>

<p>"And Mary thinks Blake can get it back for her?"</p>

<p>"Presumably. Otherwise why should she be mixed up in it at all.
That's where the devil of it comes in. Of course he is
double-crossing her."</p>

<p>"Why should you think that?" said Tiny slowly.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, it's obvious. If this proof lies out here in
the hands of Berendosi's crowd, you don't suppose they are going to
give it up to help Blake's love affair. But as a matter of fact, I
don't think for a moment it is out here. It's locked up in Felton
Blake's safe. Otherwise why should he have come into it at all? He
was no good to them: they didn't want him if they held it
themselves. No: he started the hare himself. He holds the trump
card, though he is probably pretending to Lady Mary that he is
moving heaven and earth to help her."</p>

<p>"I'd like to wring the blighter's neck," grunted Tiny.</p>

<p>"So would a good many other people," said Standish with a short
laugh. "But it's hardly worth while being hanged for exterminating
vermin. No: it's the other one that I want, Tiny: the big man. And
I hoped to get on his trail through Demeroff. You see, one of the
most extraordinary things about this gang is the elusiveness of its
members. It sounds fantastic, but I can assure you that sometimes I
have been tempted to think that they hold the secret of becoming
invisible. Not once, but a dozen times have people we wanted
vanished from practically under our noses. It is incredible."</p>

<p>"Disguise of some sort, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You can take it from me that it's got to be a pretty useful
disguise to deceive our fellows. And yet&mdash;they've done it. Why
only a week ago in Paris, we hunted two of them to ground in a
smallish hotel in the Rue Tivoli. Men were posted at every
entrance, but they got away&mdash;slipped clean through our
fingers. It's positively uncanny."</p>

<p>"Ana have you no idea of the whereabouts of their
headquarters?"</p>

<p>"I believe it to be somewhere in this country. In fact, I'm
almost sure it is."</p>

<p>"Well, old lad, you're the commanding officer for this
expedition," said Tiny. "What does A do, beyond lighting an
Abdullah?"</p>

<p>And at that moment a page boy entered the bar with a
telegram.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Carteret?"</p>

<p>"That's me," said Tiny, taking the envelope.</p>

<p>He glanced through the message: then with a laugh he handed it
to Standish.</p>

<p>"That would seem to give us a pointer, Ronald."</p>

<p>For the wire which had been handed in in Paris ran as
follows:</p>

<p>"Can you go Hotel Royal Dalzburg at once. Mazarin."</p>

<p>"As you say, Tiny," said Standish, "it seems to give us a
pointer. Well&mdash;the capital of Bessonia is a delightful spot.
And since Demeroff's removal prevents us getting direct at their
headquarters, perhaps we'll do it through the side track of
Berendosi's little scheme. But I wonder what the lady can have
discovered in Paris to cause her to send that."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DALZBURG, as Ronald Standish had said, was a
delightful place, and when they arrived there the next day it was
looking its loveliest. The picturesque old town, dominated by the
Palace standing on the wooded heights behind it, was bathed in the
early-morning sunshine, as they rattled over the cobbled bridge
which spans the river. But at the moment their thoughts were
centred on the mundane questions of baths and food, and it was not
until eleven o'clock that they sauntered forth from the hotel for a
stroll round.</p>

<p>It was Tiny's first visit to the place, though Standish knew it
well. And since they had found nothing further at the hotel to
explain the Countess's telegram in any way, there seemed to be
nothing to do except kick their heels and wait. Presumably in time
its reason would become clear.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember," said Standish after a while, "that they
make a not indifferent brand of beer. What about it, Tiny?"</p>

<p>"Lead me to it, old boy. These damned continental sleepers give
me a mouth like a lime kiln."</p>

<p>They found a vacant table at a shady café on the main boulevard
and sat down. The place was full of people bent on the same errand,
and as luck would have it, their immediate neighbours were not
tourists but natives of the place.</p>

<p>"You'll often get more reliable information from the apparently
idle chatter in a place like this," said Standish, "than from a
score of agents. But you must be able to speak the lingo."</p>

<p>"How many can you speak, Ronald?" asked Tiny curiously.</p>

<p>"About fifteen, old boy," laughed the other. "They seem to come
naturally to me."</p>

<p>He half closed his eyes, and leaning back in his chair he
relapsed into silence. To the casual observer he seemed almost
asleep: in reality every sense was alert. Times out of number had
he played this same game, and even if it was only once in twenty
that anything tangible rewarded his efforts, it was at any rate
good practice in the language.</p>

<p>The first essential was to shut out as far as possible the
people who were obviously useless to him, and long practice had
enabled him to do this in the most amazing way. He could
deliberately, as it were, shut down parts of his brain, till only
one particular conversation came through, while the rest seemed
merely an aimless buzz. And now, having cut out a nursemaid with
children on his right, and a loving couple on his left, he
concentrated on two men sitting at the table just behind him as
being the only possible source of interest.</p>

<p>At first he drew blank: they were discussing some recent
reconstruction scheme in the business belonging to one of them. The
other he gathered was interested financially: the matter of a
mortgage cropped up. Influential men evidently: men of substance.
And he was just preparing to relax and get on with his beer, when a
name caught his attention. One of them mentioned Berendosi.</p>

<p>But luck was out: both at once lowered their voices, and strain
his ears as much as he could he was unable to catch more than an
odd word here and there. Suddenly, however, one of them made a
remark which he heard perfectly and which riveted his
attention.</p>

<p>"There. That man the other side of the street. The tall
Englishman. I tell you it's obvious."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and looked across the road. There was no
mistaking whom they were alluding to: there was only one man who
could possibly be an Englishman. And even as he was idly
speculating as to what was obvious, he heard a sudden exclamation
from beside him. He glanced round: Tiny Carteret had half risen
from his seat and was staring at the Englishman himself.</p>

<p>Now Standish was a man who thought quickly, and though he was
completely in the dark himself as to why two prominent Bessonians
and Tiny should both be interested in the same man, his brain
reacted instinctively.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Tiny," he said curtly. "Don't pay any attention to
that man across the road. I'll explain later."</p>

<p>A little bewildered, Tiny obeyed, and once again Standish leaned
back in his chair. Had the two men behind him noticed Tiny's
movement? If so, good-bye to any chance of hearing any more.
Apparently they had not, and stray snatches of their conversation
came to him.</p>

<p>"Undoubted... Gregoroff saw him... Hotel Royal.... Must be the
same man.... There won't be much trouble... Berendosi must see
him..."</p>

<p>And then their voices became mere whispers, and not another word
could he hear, during the remaining ten minutes they sat at their
table.</p>

<p>"I will now have another beer," said Standish, as he watched
their retreating backs.</p>

<p>"What was the great idea, Ronald?"</p>

<p>"Well, old boy, it was obvious that you knew or thought you knew
the Englishman on the other side of the street. It was equally
obvious that the two men who have just left were interested in him
too, as they were talking about him. And I thought I might hear a
good deal more if your mutual interest wasn't paraded too
obviously."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?"</p>

<p>"Only snatches of conversation. He is stopping at the Royal, and
he is obviously the same man. Same as what I can't tell you. They
also are anxious for Berendosi to see him. Not much, I admit, but
one often finds that little clues like that help one later.
Now&mdash;your turn. Who did you think he was?"</p>

<p>"Three years ago when Princess Olga, as she then was, was over
in London, there were four of us who used to get about a good bit
together. She, Mary, myself, and a fellow called Joe Denver. And
unless I'm very much mistaken that was Joe Denver himself. A bit
more tanned, but I'm almost certain it was him&mdash;same walk and
everything. And if it was him, it is the most extraordinary
coincidence, because Mary and I were only talking about him the
other afternoon, and wondering where he was. And here he is
apparently stopping at the same hotel."</p>

<p>Ronald Standish lit a cigarette, and stared thoughtfully across
the sunny street.</p>

<p>"That's interesting, Tiny&mdash;very interesting. I wonder if at
last something tangible is in sight."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the thing isn't a coincidence at all&mdash;except
that you and Lady Mary should have been talking about him. But is
it his presence here that was the cause of the wire you got
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" cried Tiny, "that's possible."</p>

<p>"It's more than possible, old boy&mdash;it's probable. But we
must not go too fast. Let's take the points. Something must have
inspired that wire. And when we find a man staying at the hotel we
are told to come to, who was a friend of the Queen's in days gone
by and is now an object of great interest to Berendosi and his lot,
surely there must be some connection. It's stretching coincidence
too far altogether to imagine there isn't. I wonder, Tiny: I
wonder. Are we on the verge of something that isn't merely
guess-work?"</p>

<p>"Mark you, I won't swear that it was Joe Denver," said Tiny.</p>

<p>Standish glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time for tiffin. Let's go back to the pub and
see."</p>

<p>They found him in the corner of the lounge, and all doubts were
set at rest immediately. For the instant he saw Tiny he jumped to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Carteret&mdash;by all that's wonderful. What brings you
here?"</p>

<p>"I might almost ask the same," said Tiny. "By the way, Denver,
let me introduce you. This is Standish. Well, old boy, how goes it?
It's a long time since we met."</p>

<p>"Over three years. I've been in the back of beyond since then.
This is my first leave."</p>

<p>"Are you spending it all here?" asked Standish casually.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Denver a little curtly. "It depends."</p>

<p>He turned to Tiny, and asked after Lady Mary, while Standish
studied him covertly with shrewd blue eyes. An expert in sizing up
a man, he preferred to listen rather than to talk. And it soon
became obvious to his trained observation that this good-looking
youngster's nerves were on edge. There was an air of unrest about
him, and once or twice he glanced round the lounge almost
nervously.</p>

<p>That there was something the matter with him was clear: that he
was not inclined to be communicative was also clear&mdash;his curt
answer to Standish's question proved that. But being a past master
in the art of getting things out of uncommunicative people, he was
content to bide his time. That this youngster was involved in the
matter in some way he was convinced: as he had said to Tiny, the
coincidence if it were not so would be too amazing. Besides, his
whole demeanour simply shouted the fact that something was up.</p>

<p>Suddenly Denver started to his feet angrily. He was glaring
across the lounge, and Standish followed the direction of his
glance. Two men were sitting at a small table, who looked away
immediately they saw they were observed.</p>

<p>"I'll give that damned fellow a thick ear soon," said Denver
furiously.</p>

<p>"Steady, old lad," said Tiny, pulling him back into his chair.
"What's all the worry?"</p>

<p>"You see that pasty-faced swab over there with a dial like a
suet pudding? Well, that fellow he's with is the fourth man he's
brought in here for the express purpose of looking at me." He
grinned a little sheepishly as if ashamed of his temper. "I don't
resemble any blinking Prince, do I, travelling incognito?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're not imagining it?" said Standish
quietly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain. It started the very morning I arrived.
That's three days ago. I was sitting in here, when pasty face
arrived on the scene, and sat down at the next table. At first he
took no notice of me: he certainly hadn't looked at me as he sat
down. And then just as I was lighting a cigarette I found him
staring at me. He turned away at once, but for the next ten minutes
he did nothing but study my face when he thought I wasn't looking.
After that I got a bit fed up, so I wandered to the bar. And the
first thing he did&mdash;I could see it reflected in the
mirror&mdash;was to go over to the reception clerk and ask who I
was. I'm certain it was that because the fellow opened the
visitors' book. I didn't think much more about it at the time, but
since then he's led in four different blokes, with the express
purpose of letting them see me. Damn it! I may not be a prize
beauty, but I'm not a bally freak, am I?"</p>

<p>"You've never been here before, have you, Denver?" said Standish
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Never in my life," said the other. "Anyway, what's that got to
do with it?"</p>

<p>"I was only wondering. At any rate it seems perfectly clear that
your pasty-faced friend is interested in you for some reason or
other. Perhaps you bear a strong resemblance to some local
celebrity. By Jove!"&mdash;he paused as if struck with a sudden
idea&mdash;"I wonder if that can be the reason. You don't know von
Emmerling, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of him in my life. Why?"</p>

<p>"I wondered if he had written and asked you to come here."</p>

<p>"Nobody wrote and asked me to come here. I only decided at the
very last moment and got off the boat at Brindisi. Who is von
Emmerling, anyway?"</p>

<p>But Standish seemed to have lost interest in the matter.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he said. "Evidently as you don't know him,
that can't be the reason."</p>

<p>"But," persisted the other, "if there was any reason why this
bloke should ask me here, that may account for the other
thing."</p>

<p>"Von Emmerling," said Standish, "is one of the big German film
magnates. And I believe he is going to stage one of his productions
here. Moreover I know he is on the look-out for a tall fair
Englishman, and it occurred to me as a possibility that he might
have approached you on the matter."</p>

<p>Tiny glanced at Standish out of the corner of his eye, but his
face was expressionless.</p>

<p>"Afraid it doesn't fit," said Denver. "Still it's possible you
may be right. These blokes may be sizing me up from that point of
view, though I fear they'll be disappointed. And incidentally that
reminds me." He leaned forward in his chair. "By Jove! Standish, I
wonder if you have hit it. Yesterday morning, when I was on the
other side of the river strolling along the bank, a most persistent
merchant with a camera came badgering me. Wanted to take my photo:
no need to pay if I wasn't satisfied with the result. You
know&mdash;all the usual palaver. I told him to go to hell, but for
all that he took a couple. And it was only when I threatened to
fling his cursed machine in the river and him after it that he
vamoosed."</p>

<p>Once again Tiny glanced at Standish: in his eyes there was the
faintest perceptible gleam of satisfaction. But his voice when he
answered was as expressionless as ever.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks as if I might be right," he said. "Anyway, I
wouldn't let the matter worry you. Well, I don't know about you
fellows but I'm going to have a bite of lunch. See you afterwards,
Denver."</p>

<p>"The plot thickens a little, Tiny," he went on as they sat down
to lunch.</p>

<p>"Who on earth is von Emmerling?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"He wasn't too bad, was he?" laughed Standish. "Realizing our
young friend was a bit nervy and touchy when asked a direct
question I invented the gentleman on the spur of the moment. And I
must say he justified his birth, even if he has complicated things.
Because if Denver is speaking the truth it was a sheer fluke that
he came here."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, it's obvious. Had someone&mdash;I don't care
who, asked him here, it would presuppose that that someone knew
him. But if he came absolutely by chance, it's damned difficult to
understand. Why should anyone be concerned with the arrival of an
unknown Englishman who has never been here before? Unless..."</p>

<p>"Unless what?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"And why bother about his photograph?" went on Standish,
disregarding the question. "It's puzzling. Unless..."</p>

<p>Once again he paused, and this time Tiny did not interrupt.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Tiny"&mdash;he lowered his voice and leaned over the
table&mdash;"when you and he and Lady Mary used to go about, was
there anything between him and the fourth member of the party?"</p>

<p>"I see what you're driving at," said Tiny slowly. "Not as far as
I know, Ronald. We played round a bit, and he may have been a bit
keen on her. But that's all. Only, of course, I'm the world's most
almighty mutt at spotting anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"Then I can't understand it," said Standish. "It beats me. I
suppose Gillson put you wise to the state of affairs out here."</p>

<p>"Squire Straker did."</p>

<p>"Same thing. Well, what had occurred to me was that young Denver
might have been indiscreet with a certain lady&mdash;written a
letter or something of that sort&mdash;and these blokes have found
out about it. I admit that there are a lot of
difficulties&mdash;not the least of them being, how they know him.
I mean if there is some letter that has fallen into the wrong
hands&mdash;if, in other words, that is where Mr. Felton Blake
comes in&mdash;you can't recognize a man through his handwriting.
So why this excitement over him?"</p>

<p>"Assuming for the moment, Ronald, that you're right, and that
there was more in it than I thought, mightn't it be possible that
the indiscretion has been committed since he came here? That a
certain lady has met him on the quiet and been spotted."</p>

<p>"Possible," agreed the other, "but it won't account for
everything. He has only been here three days, and this song and
dance started two months ago. No, Tiny: there's the deuce of a lot
more in this than meets the eye. And as far as I can see our only
hope is to persuade someone to talk. At present we're working in
the dark. Lead Denver on after lunch, if you can. Mention of the
lady in question will come quite naturally from you. And this is no
time for half measures. I've got a feeling in my bones that things
will shortly come to a head. By Jove! don't look round, but do you
know who has just come in? Berendosi himself."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Only by sight."</p>

<p>"I was introduced to him in the train to Paris. It may prove
useful."</p>

<p>"He's coming this way. If he doesn't recognize you, you
recognize him. As you say, he may be useful."</p>

<p>As luck would have it he went to the next table. Preceded by the
<i>mâitre d'hôtel</i>, and surrounded by other lesser minions, the
great man was piloted to his seat, and having ordered his meal he
glanced round the room. And the first person his eyes fell on was
Tiny.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at him with a puzzled look: then he came
across.</p>

<p>"Surely we met in the Golden Arrow?" he said courteously.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Signor," said Tiny, "though I hardly expected you
to remember me."</p>

<p>"You were with our charming Countess Nada," remarked the other.
"I had no idea you were proposing to honour us with a visit."</p>

<p>"I'm just wandering at random," said Tiny carelessly. "By the
way, may I introduce Mr. Standish&mdash;Signor Berendosi."</p>

<p>"Your first visit, Mr. Standish?" said Berendosi politely.</p>

<p>"No: I have been here several times. I love Dalzburg."</p>

<p>"It is indeed a beautiful spot," agreed Berendosi. "A little
unhealthy sometimes, but one cannot have everything."</p>

<p>"How true," said Standish. "And one can always take suitable
precautions against&mdash;er&mdash;ill health."</p>

<p>For a moment the eyes of the two met and measured: then with a
murmured banality Berendosi resumed his seat. And even as he did so
Joe Denver passed the table.</p>

<p>"Have you finished, you fellows?" he remarked. "If so, come and
have some coffee with me outside. Who was the bird who was talking
to you?" he went on as they left the room. "The method of his entry
seemed to indicate he was a big noise."</p>

<p>"That was Signor Berendosi," said Standish quietly. "Probably
the most influential man in this country. And the most
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Oh! What's he up against?"</p>

<p>"The existing system, Denver," said Standish. "The Royal House,
the King and&mdash;the Queen."</p>

<p>Denver paused with a cigarette half-way to his mouth, and stared
at him.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" he raid. "Up against the King and the
Queen. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he wants to turn this country into a republic of which
he will be the President."</p>

<p>"But has he any chance of succeeding?" demanded Denver.</p>

<p>Standish shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You never can tell, my dear fellow, in spots like this. These
people are not as we are, you know. And a small thing, such as say
some bit of gossip or scandal against the Queen, might prove very
dangerous."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" said Denver angrily.
"Scandal against the Queen! Such a thing is impossible. Ask
Carteret. He knows her."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Standish soothingly, "you are surely man
enough of the world to know that it isn't the truth that counts,
but what people believe is the truth. I should be the last person
to believe anything against such a very charming lady:
nevertheless, the bald fact remains that Berendosi and the very
influential group who are backing him have started insidious
rumours about the Queen."</p>

<p>"I'll break the damned swine's neck for him," said the youngster
through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"Don't be such an ass, boy," said Standish sternly but not
unkindly. "You're in a country now, where if they wish, you go into
prison first and the charge comes on in a year or two. You've got
to keep your head and your temper, or you'll be for it. Now I'm
going to ask you an absolutely straight question. Why are you so
very upset over what I've told you?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't any decent fellow be?" answered the other.</p>

<p>"That's not good enough," said Standish. "I don't wish to probe
into your private affairs, but there are times when it is
necessary. And this is one of them. There are international
questions at stake which render it essential. Now what are the
facts? You, returning from the back of beyond, as you said
yourself, after three years, decide suddenly to come here.
Why?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I can please myself, can't I?" said the youngster
angrily.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Denver," said Standish gravely, "don't take it
that way. Try and understand that I am not being gratuitously
offensive and impertinent: try and understand that there are far
bigger questions at stake than your feelings or mine."</p>

<p>"But how on earth can my movements have anything to do with
them?" demanded Denver.</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I know, and that's what I'm trying to find out. I
don't mind confessing to you now that there is no such person as
von Emmerling. I invented him to find out one thing from you, and I
succeeded. Your coming here was a sudden decision: no one had asked
you. Very well then&mdash;what am I as an outside observer
confronted with? The very significant fact, that the group of men
who are at the bottom of the conspiracy against the Queen, are also
keenly interested in an unknown Englishman arriving in Dalzburg for
the first time. And I ask myself: Why?"</p>

<p>"What possible connection can there be between the two things?"
said Denver.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;but for one other fact. The Englishman in question
at one time knew the Queen very well. Steady now: don't lose your
temper. As I told you before&mdash;it's not the truth that counts,
and these people are capable of faking anything. Can you think of
any letter which has passed between you and the lady concerned, and
which by some wild stretch of imagination might be construed into
something compromising?"</p>

<p>For a moment Denver hesitated: then he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I've never written to the lady in my life," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, do you think it possible," persisted Standish, "that the
lady in question might have written to you and the letter has gone
astray?"</p>

<p>"That, of course, is possible," answered Denver in a low voice.
"Good God! Standish, you don't think, do you, that I may have
caused her any harm?"</p>

<p>"Not wittingly, my dear fellow, but we've got to try and find a
solution to certain facts. And I tell you frankly that I cannot
help thinking that the Berendosi crowd are in the possession of
some definite piece of evidence which they propose to use against
the Queen. And further, I cannot help thinking that you by coming
here have played straight into their hands, because I believe that
evidence concerns you."</p>

<p>"But how could they possibly know me? I've never been here
before."</p>

<p>"That is not an insuperable difficulty," said Standish.
"Berendosi's machinations have been going on for years. What more
likely then, than that, when the future consort of the King was in
London he had her watched? And it was there that you were seen by
someone who recognized you again here."</p>

<p>For a moment or two he stared at the youngster, with eyes that
were full of understanding, for Joe Denver's expression was plain
to read.</p>

<p>"We are all out for one thing, young Denver," he went on
gravely: "to protect the honour of a lady. And I've been very frank
with you. Will you be equally frank with me?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" said the other.</p>

<p>"Just this. Assuming for the moment that I am right: assuming
for the moment that a letter from the lady to you had gone astray,
can you give me any idea as to the terms it would have been couched
in. I mean," he went on with a smile, "would it have started 'Dear
Mr. Denver'?"</p>

<p>For a while Joe Denver stared in front of him: then he got up
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I loved her," he said quietly, "as I didn't believe it was
possible for a man to love a woman. And I think&mdash;I know, she
felt the same about me. And I came here in the hopes that perhaps I
might catch a glimpse of her, now and then, as she drove through
the streets. I shall be in my room if you want me: this has got to
be talked over. And understand one thing, Standish. I am prepared
to do anything&mdash;anything to help."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," said Tiny as Denver disappeared. "He kept
mighty dark about it."</p>

<p>"You didn't expect him to put it in the papers, did you?"
Standish gave a short laugh. "You may be a darned fine player of
Rugby football, old lad, but as an observer of human nature you are
not in the international class. Hell, Tiny, and once again Hell.
This is a devilish serious matter."</p>

<p>"We're not certain yet, Ronald."</p>

<p>"If by that you mean we've no absolute proof, you're right. But
short of that, I'm as certain of it as I ever could be of anything.
You take my word for it, Tiny&mdash;a letter was written and it's
fallen into the wrong hands. Lord! It's as plain as a pike-staff.
That accounts for the photographer taking snapshots of him. When
the time is ripe they will publish the letter in one of their
rotten rags&mdash;probably in the original handwriting, and on the
page opposite the snapshots of the man to whom the letter was sent.
Strengthens their case enormously: just the sort of thing the
public eats. They'll pretend, of course, to take some action
against the editor, but the mischief will have been done. I wish to
Heaven the youngster had never come here, though it's too late to
worry about that now."</p>

<p>Tiny lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"So you think Felton Blake in some way got hold of a
compromising letter written to young Denver," he said after a
while. "Bit difficult to account for, Ronald. If Denver had
received one, and had then mislaid it, it wouldn't be so hard. But
it's almost incredible to believe that the lady would have left it
lying about, and the only other alternative is that it was tampered
with in the post."</p>

<p>"Blotting-paper," said Standish. "An unscrupulous floor waiter
or chambermaid reads the letter in a looking-glass. Then realizing
who the writer is he at once sees the financial value of the thing,
and in the fullness of time it finds its way into Felton Blake's
hands."</p>

<p>He drained his coffee and began to fill a pipe.</p>

<p>"Don't think that I'm not fully alive to the difficulties,
Tiny," he went on. "There are many. If my blotting-paper theory is
right, why didn't Denver get the letter? An answer to that is that
possibly the lady on second thoughts tore the letter up and never
sent it. Then there's another point: how does the lady in question
know anything about it? Has Berendosi told her? Has he already held
it over her head? If so, it seems a very unnecessary thing to do.
The one thing I should have thought he would not do is to give his
victim any warning until he is ready to strike. And yet even with
all the difficulties&mdash;it must be the solution; it must
be."</p>

<p>"Look here, Ronald, would it do any good if I went and saw the
Queen. I don't know how it's done, as I've never been in the habit
of calling on Queens. But if we can find out the correct procedure
I'm sure she'd see me, and I might be able to find out
something."</p>

<p>"A darned good idea, Tiny: darned good. Here's Berendosi: ask
him. He'll know the ropes. And you can make the request without
arousing any suspicion."</p>

<p>"Are you making a long stay, Mr. Carteret?"</p>

<p>Berendosi paused by their table, and glancing up Tiny saw that
his eyes were fixed on the chair just vacated by Joe Denver.</p>

<p>"It depends, Signor," he answered. "By the way, I wonder if you
could help me over something?"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said the other. "In what way can I
assist you?"</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down and join us in some coffee?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind."</p>

<p>He seated himself, and leaned forward attentively.</p>

<p>"Two or three years ago in London," said Tiny, "I had the honour
of seeing a good deal of Her Majesty the Queen before she was
married. And if it is not presumption on my part I would so like to
renew my acquaintance. I was wondering if perhaps you could tell me
whether such a thing is possible; and if so, how I should set about
it."</p>

<p>For a moment or two Berendosi sat as if carved in stone, his
eyes fixed on Tiny's face.</p>

<p>"Certainly such a thing is possible," he said quietly. "And
equally certainly I can help you. I feel sure Her Majesty would be
delighted to see you again. As a matter of fact I am going to the
Palace this afternoon, and if you would care to come with me I am
sure I can arrange an audience. It will of course only be an
informal one."</p>

<p>"That is more than good of you," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"And would Mr. Standish care to come as well?"</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot," said Standish. "I have very urgent letters to
write."</p>

<p>"And your other friend&mdash;the good-looking boy?"</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he indicated the empty coffee cup.</p>

<p>"He unfortunately has fulfilled your warning to me, Signor,
concerning bad health," said Standish gravely. "He's got a very
sharp attack of fever: I'm going up to him now."</p>

<p>"I would," said Berendosi suavely. "It would be a pity if in
spite of his fever he suddenly appeared."</p>

<p>Ronald Standish's eyes twinkled: though he disliked the man his
quickness appealed to him.</p>

<p>"He is far too well brought up a patient for that," he answered.
"Well, Tiny, I shall see you later. Adieu, Signor."</p>

<p>Berendosi watched him in silence as he went up the stairs: then
he turned to Tiny.</p>

<p>"So that is the celebrated Ronald Standish, is it?" he remarked.
"I am glad to have met him."</p>

<p>"Celebrated!" Tiny raised his eyebrows. "I should hardly have
thought he was that."</p>

<p>"His reputation is European. Not perhaps amongst the <i>hoi
polloi</i>, but in those circles that count." An enigmatic smile
twitched round his lips. "Well, I trust your young friend's fever
will have abated: these sudden attacks are most disconcerting,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"A sort of malaria he got in Africa," said Tiny carelessly.</p>

<p>"Then, of course, it would be unwise for him to meet Her
Majesty," agreed Berendosi. "One should always be careful in cases
of malaria to avoid anything which might send the patient's
temperature up."</p>

<p>"I hardly see why meeting the Queen should do that, Signor,"
said Tiny, staring him straight in the face.</p>

<p>"No? Well, well, perhaps you're right. Anyway the situation does
not arise&mdash;this afternoon."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Carteret, if you are ready, we might start. My car is
waiting outside the hotel."</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence as soon as they moved off and Tiny was
not sorry: he wanted to think. It was the personal side of the
thing that hit him considerably more than it did Ronald Standish.
To him the fact that these two had been in love with one another
merely complicated the practical difficulties of the situation:
they were just two strangers. But to Tiny they were two old
friends.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering if Mary had known at the time. Of
course she had: trust a woman for spotting anything of that sort.
And now that he too looked back he began to remember little things
which should have told him the condition of affairs: small pointers
he had ignored at the time but which now seemed ridiculously
obvious.</p>

<p>"I loved her, as I didn't believe it was possible for a man to
love a woman."</p>

<p>Joe Denver's words rang in his brain, and suddenly he looked at
the man sitting beside him. And a great desire took possession of
him to hit that man's face and continue hitting it hard and often
and then again some. For the full swinishness of the thing had
struck him for the first time. Not only was he going to exploit a
big love for his own ends, but he was going to do it in such a way
that the woman would be held up to shame and obloquy. And his great
desire grew even greater.</p>

<p>"Have you ever played rugger, Signor?" he asked as the car swung
through the Palace gates.</p>

<p>"Rugger, Mr. Carteret? I am afraid I don't quite
understand."</p>

<p>"Football, Signor," said Tiny dreamily. "And sometimes a man
goes down on the ball when there are eight large forwards who want
that ball."</p>

<p>"It sounds most unpleasant," said Berendosi politely.</p>

<p>"It is: most unpleasant." A gentle smile spread over Tiny's
face. "You should play rugger, Signor: I am sure you would enjoy
it."</p>

<p>"Presumably you play forward yourself, Mr. Carteret."</p>

<p>"I do," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Then when I am next in England I must come and watch you. I
should like to see what happens to the man who goes down on the
ball before I start playing myself."</p>

<p>"They have an open grave ready dug for him," murmured Tiny.</p>

<p>"I think then that I will be one of the eight forwards," said
Berendosi.</p>

<p>"You aren't a big enough man, Signor," remarked Tiny quietly,
and at that moment the car stopped.</p>

<p>If Berendosi appreciated the insult he showed no sign beyond a
faint smile. He gave a curt order to his chauffeur and then led the
way past a sentry who saluted. And the first thing that struck Tiny
was that even among members of the household itself, his companion
was evidently, as Joe Denver put it, the big noise. Footmen and
underlings of all descriptions sprang up and bowed obsequiously as
he passed, and Berendosi took not the slightest notice of any of
them.</p>

<p>"Now if you wait in there, Mr. Carteret"&mdash;he indicated a
small ante-room&mdash;"I will see what I can do."</p>

<p>Left to himself, Tiny studied his surroundings. The room looked
out over the town and river towards the snow-capped mountains away
to the north. Just in front lay the garden, and beyond it came the
woods which covered the lower part of the hill. Much like an
ordinary English country house, he reflected, set in beautiful
surroundings. And he was just wondering if he dared to smoke, when
a girl appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty will be delighted to see you, Mr. Carteret," she
said with a smile. "Come along this way."</p>

<p>He followed her down a corridor, until they reached a room at
the end.</p>

<p>"Signor Berendosi is with her," said the girl as she opened the
door.</p>

<p>They were standing by the window as he entered, and the Queen
greeted him with a charming smile.</p>

<p>"This is a real pleasure, Mr. Carteret," she said as he bent and
kissed her hand. "I could hardly believe my ears when Signor
Berendosi told me you were here."</p>

<p>"It is more than good of Your Majesty to remember me," said
Tiny.</p>

<p>"One doesn't forget old friends like that," she answered. "Mary
was out here with me a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>"A pity that your visit and hers did not coincide, Mr.
Carteret," said Berendosi suavely. "It would have been quite a
reunion for Her Majesty."</p>

<p>"Where are you staying, Mr. Carteret?" asked the Queen.</p>

<p>"At the Royal Hotel, ma'am," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"With a very well-known compatriot of his, Your Majesty,"
remarked Berendosi. "Ronald Standish. And another friend who has
gone down with fever. I didn't catch his name, Mr. Carteret."</p>

<p>Tiny had realized it would come sooner or later: had realized
indeed that the main reason why Berendosi had taken the trouble he
had was to see what effect Joe Denver's name would have on the
Queen. And there was no way out of it. Manifestly he couldn't
pretend not to know.</p>

<p>"Someone else you knew in London, Your Majesty," he said
quietly. "A great friend of Mary's&mdash;Joe Denver."</p>

<p>Just for a moment her eyes dilated&mdash;her body grew rigid:
just for a moment she gave herself away to the lynx-eyed man who
was watching her. Then she recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Of course. I remember him perfectly," she answered. "I do hope
he's not bad."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Tiny. "Just a sudden return of malaria."</p>

<p>"Should he not be better to-night, Mr. Carteret," remarked
Berendosi with a faintly mocking smile, "I can give you the name of
my own doctor. And now if Your Majesty will graciously excuse me I
have some important papers to attend to. My car, Mr. Carteret, will
be waiting for you."</p>

<p>He backed from the room, and the door had barely closed behind
him before her whole demeanour changed.</p>

<p>"Drop the Queen business, Tiny," she cried. "Let's go back three
years. Tell me about&mdash;about Joe Denver. Is he really ill?"</p>

<p>"He's not ill at all," said Tiny with a smile. "But I think it
was better, don't you, that he shouldn't meet you before the
extremely astute eyes of the gentleman who has just left us."</p>

<p>"You guessed, did you," she said softly. "Or did Mary tell
you?"</p>

<p>And then somewhat to his relief she went on without waiting for
an answer.</p>

<p>"I must see him again, Tiny: I simply must."</p>

<p>"But, Olga," he cried, "such a thing would be madness just
now."</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded. "Nobody else knows. It's no different to my
seeing you."</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at her in amazement: what on earth was
she talking about?</p>

<p>"But with Berendosi on the look out," he stammered, "it would be
dangerous to a degree."</p>

<p>"That pig of a man is always on the look out," she cried. "And I
can easily fool him. I must, Tiny: I must see him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it could be arranged," he said at length, more to gain
time than anything else. Was it possible that she was in ignorance
of the whole plot? Certainly from the way she was talking it looked
like it.</p>

<p>"It must be: it must be. I've never seen him, Tiny, since those
days in London."</p>

<p>"But you've written to him," he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Never," she said, and he looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>"Not even in those days in London?" he persisted.</p>

<p>And once again she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I've never written to him in my life," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you didn't and then tear the letter up?"</p>

<p>He saw her give a little frown of annoyance, and he realized
that it must seem to her he was being <i>gauche</i>. But it was
imperative to find out the truth: if the answer to the last
question was again in the negative Ronald's theory fell to pieces.
And it was&mdash;emphatically.</p>

<p>"I've never put pen to paper to him, Tiny," she said. "Why do
you ask? You're mysterious, you know," she went on a little
petulantly. "Like Mary when she was out here. And Nada&mdash;do you
remember her? She has just been over to England."</p>

<p>"I travelled back to Paris with her," he said.</p>

<p>And then she switched back to Joe Denver. How was he? What did
he look like? How long was he going to stay? And Tiny answered
almost mechanically, so dumbfounded was he at the new turn of
events.</p>

<p>At length she dismissed him, having first extracted a half
promise that somehow or other he was to bring Joe Denver to see
her. He had not the heart to refuse point blank; she was so
desperately in earnest and so wistfully pretty.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," he said gently, and just for a moment
her mouth trembled.</p>

<p>"Half an hour is not much in a lifetime, Tiny," she
whispered.</p>

<p>He left her standing by the window&mdash;a slim girlish figure
in white&mdash;and went in search of the car. He found it waiting
for him, with Berendosi inside perusing some papers.</p>

<p>"It was good of you to wait, Signor," he remarked as he got
in.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mr. Carteret. And I hope your audience with Her
Majesty was a pleasant one."</p>

<p>"Very, thank you."</p>

<p>"With two such old acquaintances it was bound to be," murmured
the other. "By the way, the mention of your young friend's name
seemed to upset the Queen a little."</p>

<p>"I didn't notice it," said Tiny curtly.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" A faint smile flickered round the other's lips.
"Perhaps it was my imagination." He turned suddenly and faced Tiny.
"Mr. Carteret: it might be as well if we all understood one
another. I am not under the delusion that you have come to Dalzburg
to gaze upon our charming scenery. And therefore I would be glad if
you would convey a message from me to the excellent Standish. So
long as you confine yourselves to our scenery we shall be delighted
and honoured to have you with us. But should other activities begin
to take place&mdash;well, then, Mr. Carteret, I am convinced we
should discover some irregularity in both your passports. Do I make
myself clear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about Standish, but my passport is in perfect
order," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carteret! Really! Your lack of intelligence pains me. Ah!
here we are. Well&mdash;you won't forget my little message.
Adieu!"</p>

<p>The car rolled off, and Tiny entered the hotel, where he found
Standish waiting for him in the lounge.</p>

<p>"Come into the bar, Ronald," he said. "I need a drink."</p>

<p>"Did you see her?" asked the other as they crossed the
lounge.</p>

<p>"I did. And alone. She swears that she never wrote a line to
him&mdash;not even one that she subsequently tore up. So unless
she's forgotten, your blotting-paper theory goes down the drain.
Moreover, she seems to be in complete ignorance that there is
anything in the air at all."</p>

<p>Standish stared at him nonplussed. "That makes things a bit
harder, doesn't it? And did you enlighten her?"</p>

<p>"I thought it better not to," said Tiny. "There's another thing
also," he went on, "our friend Berendosi was kind enough to tell me
that should the spirit move him he will fake up some irregularity
on our passports, presumably with the idea of making us leave the
country."</p>

<p>"That possibility&mdash;like the poor&mdash;has always been with
us," said Standish with a short laugh. "And, 'pon my soul, Tiny, I
don't know that we're doing much good here. I've got half a mind to
go back to England and try from the Felton Blake end. I don't
remember ever having felt so completely up against a blank wall.
And of course we must get young Denver out of the country. I've
told him that already. Hullo! there is a lady who seems to know you
just entered."</p>

<p>Tiny swung round: Countess Nada was coming towards them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carteret," she said a little breathlessly, "where is Mr.
Denver?"</p>

<p>"I left him up in his room about half an hour ago," said
Standish.</p>

<p>"Go and see if he's still there," she cried. "And then don't let
him out of your sight."</p>

<p>The barman was looking at them curiously, though he could not
have heard the actual words.</p>

<p>"Countess," said Tiny, "may I introduce Mr.
Standish&mdash;Countess Mazarin."</p>

<p>"Go, please&mdash;go," she said urgently. "It is vital."</p>

<p>"Give the Countess a cocktail, Tiny," said Standish, and left
the bar.</p>

<p>"It was because of Denver you sent me that wire?" said Tiny when
he had ordered the drinks.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she cried. "I'll tell you everything in a
moment. Oh! he couldn't tell, but nothing more cruel could have
happened than that he should come here."</p>

<p>She put her hand suddenly on his arm.</p>

<p>"It's too late," she whispered. "They've got him."</p>

<p>Ronald Standish was crossing the lounge, and his face was
grave.</p>

<p>"His room is empty," he said as he sat down, "and the floor
waiter tells me he dashed out wildly about twenty minutes ago after
receiving a note. Here is the envelope: I found it in the paper
basket."</p>

<p>He held it out to the Countess, who studied the writing for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," she said wearily. "Sonia Gregoroff. One of
the ladies-in-waiting and in Berendosi's pay. Oh! how cruel. You
see, I got back from Paris a few moments after you left the Queen,
Mr. Carteret. And she told me he was here. And she told me that she
could not understand...." She passed her hand over her forehead.
"I'm going distracted. I flew down here...."</p>

<p>"Don't let us lose our heads, Countess," said Standish quietly.
"You are certain about the writing on the envelope?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," she cried. "I'd know it anywhere."</p>

<p>"That settles it then. There are many questions I'd like to ask
you, but they must wait. The first vital necessity is for you to
get back to the Queen. Stay with her: remain glued to her side.
Above all things see that those two don't meet alone. And if you
find out anything telephone me here, or send a message.
But&mdash;<i>keep them apart</i>."</p>

<p>With a little nod she rose at once.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly," she said. "I'll go now."</p>

<p>"A stout-hearted girl, that," remarked Standish as she left the
hotel. "By Jove! Tiny, we're up against some pretty useful odds.
Still it's not the first time."</p>

<p>He started to fill his pipe, staring idly at the cosmopolitan
crowd that thronged the lounge outside.</p>

<p>"What's our next move, Ronald?" said Tiny after awhile.</p>

<p>"It's a bit difficult to decide, old boy. Beyond the fact that
he has been decoyed out of the hotel by a note written by
Gregoroff's daughter, we don't know anything. He may be up at the
Palace now: he may be anywhere. Until we can get some further
information there is nothing to be done as far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Do you think they've kidnapped him?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put it a bit beyond them. And if so, the proverbial
needle in the bundle of hay would be easier to find. Unless
somebody blows the gaff. You see, Tiny, we're at a hopeless
disadvantage. In England one could go to the police: here it would
be absolutely useless. We can't even go to the embassy. On the
first hint of our doing anything like that Berendosi's threat would
be put into execution, and our passports would be found irregular.
So we've got to play a lone hand, in which the first vital trick is
to get Denver out of the country."</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Nice easy hurdle for the kick off, isn't it? Still I've got
faith in the Countess. She's loyal to the core, and she's got her
head screwed on the right way. If anyone can find things out, she
will."</p>

<p>A prophecy which was duly fulfilled twenty minutes later when a
page boy brought Tiny a note. It was short and to the point.</p>

<p>"Mr. Denver was seen with Sonia Gregoroff driving in closed car
towards Gregoroff's castle. Queen knows nothing as yet. Fear some
devilry. Get him out of the country."</p>

<p>"On the face of it a somewhat tall order," said Standish with a
grin. "However, we may as well have a dip at it."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," agreed Tiny. "How do you propose we should set
about dipping?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I see it, it's like this," said Standish. "Whatever
the communication was that the lady wrote him, he evidently smelt
no rat. He left the hotel without any suspicions. Moreover, he took
no kit with him. One of two things therefore is going to happen.
Either they will keep him unsuspicious by means of some plausible
story, in which case he will probably be allowed the run of the
grounds: or having got him there they will drop the pretence and he
will find himself a virtual prisoner. In the first event there
should be no difficulty in communicating with him."</p>

<p>"And in the second?" murmured Tiny.</p>

<p>Ronald Standish knocked out his pipe.</p>

<p>"It will be considerably harder," he remarked shortly.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"MY dear Gregoroff, you seem absurdly jumpy. What
on earth is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Berendosi, his cigar drawing evenly between his teeth, surveyed
his companion with amused contempt.</p>

<p>"It's this fellow Standish coming here," said the other
uneasily. "It looks as if he must know something."</p>

<p>"He can know the lot for all I care," remarked Berendosi with a
short laugh. "What does it matter? You know," he went on after a
pause, "I'm really rather sorry for Standish. It's pathetic to see
a man of his ability endeavouring to make bricks with such a
ridiculously small quantity of straw."</p>

<p>"He might give us a lot of trouble," said Gregoroff.</p>

<p>"How can he?" demanded Berendosi. "Even granted that he knows
everything, which I think is doubtful, what can he do? As I told
his large friend only an hour ago, I should have no hesitation, if
I deemed it necessary, of cutting short their visit here. In fact,
I think I shall anyway do so to-morrow. If your charming daughter
is successful, as I am sure she will be, they will be better out of
the country. That Mazarin woman is no fool: it will only be a
question of time before she suspects we've got young Denver here.
And then I don't want Standish to take any diplomatic action. It
might complicate things."</p>

<p>He strolled to the window and stared over the country that lay,
spread out like a map, before him.</p>

<p>"A fine view you've got from here, Gregoroff," he said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>His face was as impassive as usual, but into his eyes there had
come a sudden gleam. For Paul Berendosi was allowing himself a rare
luxury: he was day dreaming. After long years he saw his life's
ambition within his grasp: so far as he could see nothing could
upset his calculations. If it had been a good thing before, the
providential arrival of the young man himself now made it a
certainty. The thing was fool-proof, and he had said no more than
the truth when he had remarked to Gregoroff that he didn't care if
Standish knew everything.</p>

<p>Therein lay the beauty of the scheme: the hand could be played
with all the cards on the table. The ground was prepared: his spies
and underlings had done their work well. Now all that remained was
the one culminating thing which would split the country from top to
bottom. Bloodshed perhaps: what of it? No man can step suddenly
into supreme power without some payment.</p>

<p>With an effort he came out of his reverie: Gregoroff was
speaking.</p>

<p>"What of Zavier? Is he coming?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I heard your news I wired him at once. He should be
here at any moment."</p>

<p>"What do you make of that man, Berendosi?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to say, my friend. Undoubtedly a gentleman whom I
would sooner have for me than against me." He glanced through the
window. "And here, unless I am much mistaken, is your
daughter."</p>

<p>A big red car had turned off the main road, and was coming up
the winding drive to the castle.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she has been successful."</p>

<p>He leaned still further out, as the car stopped by the front
door.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she has. Our young friend is with her. Now under no
circumstances, Gregoroff, must he see me; at any rate until our
little play is staged. I am under no delusions as to what Standish
will have told him about my poor self. And I am not at all certain
that it would not be better for you to keep out of the way also.
However, we will wait until we see your daughter, and find out what
she has to say."</p>

<p>He swung round as the door opened, and a dark, striking-looking
girl came in.</p>

<p>"Bravo! my dear Sonia," he cried. "You have done admirably. How
did you manage it?"</p>

<p>She gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"I sent him a note saying that someone very dear to him was in
grave danger, and would he come at once. And he came."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what of the Englishman&mdash;Standish. Does he know
where he's gone?"</p>

<p>"No, I asked him that in the car. You see the note was given to
him when he was alone: I saw to that. Standish was in the bar,
waiting for the big man."</p>

<p>"And the note itself?"</p>

<p>"Was in Denver's pocket. It is now torn up."</p>

<p>"Admirable, my dear, admirable," said Berendosi. "But how did
you explain to him about the grave danger?"</p>

<p>"I admitted that it was a fib," she laughed, "put in to make
sure that he came. And then I pitched him the yarn we arranged.
That it was unsafe for him to see her at the Palace, but that I was
arranging a meeting for them here. He swallowed it whole."</p>

<p>"And you don't think anyone knows he is here?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure no one does. I took every precaution, and made him sit
right back in the car."</p>

<p>"Excellent. Not that it matters very much, but it saves trouble.
Did you find out anything of interest from the young man?"</p>

<p>"A lot," she said, lighting a cigarette. "He was simply frantic
to know what all the mystery was. Evidently this man Standish has
told him that something is in the wind, and that you are at the
bottom of it. He talked about a letter written by her to him."</p>

<p>"So he doesn't know the truth," said Berendosi softly. "And
apparently Standish doesn't know it either. That is most
interesting. Undoubtedly, my dear Gregoroff, Standish and his
friend leave this country to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And this man Denver?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Remains here&mdash;until the end. Though I don't think it is
necessary, I have already taken the precaution of closing every
frontier to him. But that is only in case he should escape from
here, which is an unlikely eventuality. By the way, what is he
doing now?"</p>

<p>"Dreaming of the meeting to come," she said with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Well, I think, my dear, that it wouldn't be a bad thing if you
went and dreamt with him. I should hate him to dream anywhere near
a telephone if he was alone."</p>

<p>"I'll go," she said at once. "And I suppose neither of you will
appear till after it's over."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Berendosi. "Till then we leave him
entirely to you."</p>

<p>"A girl in a thousand, my dear fellow," he said, as the door
closed behind her. "You are to be congratulated on such a
daughter."</p>

<p>"How long are we going to keep him here, Berendosi?" said the
other.</p>

<p>"As I said before&mdash;until the end," said Berendosi curtly.
"Though if it is of any comfort to you, I think that moment is
considerably nearer than we at one time anticipated. A lot will
depend on what Zavier says."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>They both swung round: the man was standing in the door, the
monkey perched on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"And what is this new development you wired me about?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Come in, Monsieur Zavier," cried Berendosi. "I am delighted to
see you. The new development is nothing more nor less than the
arrival in the country of the young man himself."</p>

<p>"So." Zavier took a chair, and lit one of his little cigarettes.
"That is interesting. And when did he come?"</p>

<p>"A few days ago, whilst I was in England. Gregoroff recognized
him."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"In this house. A small trap was laid for him into which he
obligingly walked. Yes&mdash;he is in this house, and in this house
he will remain."</p>

<p>"You propose to keep him as a prisoner, do you? I should have
thought that better results might have been obtained by leaving him
at large."</p>

<p>"But for one fact you are quite right," agreed Berendosi. "But
we have some other English visitors who complicate things somewhat.
You may perhaps have heard of Ronald Standish?"</p>

<p>Zavier's eyes half closed.</p>

<p>"So he has arrived too, has he? But surely they didn't come
together."</p>

<p>"No. But I cannot help thinking that there is a very close
connection between the two things. By some means or other Standish
found out that Denver was here. So he at once came himself. And
though I have since found out that he doesn't know the truth, he is
very near it. That being the case it is obvious that his first idea
would be to get Denver out of the country. And though of course
that can be prevented it might give rise to unpleasantness with the
British Embassy. So taking everything into consideration I thought
it best to bring him here."</p>

<p>He held up his hand for silence as footsteps passed the door,
and Denver's cheerful laugh rang out.</p>

<p>"He seems in excellent spirits," remarked Zavier in some
surprise; and Berendosi smiled.</p>

<p>"He has at present no idea of what the future holds in store for
him," he remarked. "In fact he thinks he is going to meet a certain
lady here after dinner to-night."</p>

<p>Zavier stared at him for a moment or two in silence.</p>

<p>"And why not?" he said thoughtfully. "Such a meeting might be
made use of."</p>

<p>"It was the first idea I had," remarked Berendosi, "but I
dismissed it for two reasons. First it gives away his presence
here, and secondly I doubt greatly if the lady would come.
Gregoroff is not <i>persona grata</i>with her. But I have staged
what I think you will agree is a most entertaining little
performance, and one which will benefit us even more than her
Majesty's presence. I don't know if you have met our host's
charming daughter?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet had that pleasure," answered the other.</p>

<p>"The same build, the same colouring as our gracious Queen. In
fact when dressed in the same way it would be difficult if one
could not see their faces to tell which was which."</p>

<p>Zavier nodded appreciatively.</p>

<p>"An understudy. Excellent. And the window wide open."</p>

<p>"Better than that, my friend: far better than that.
But&mdash;wait and see. It may, of course, not come off. If so,
there is no harm done. He will anyway cease to be in good spirits
when he discovers he has been trapped. To return to more important
matters. This young man's unexpected arrival has rather altered
things. And although nothing could have suited our plans better, it
has introduced certain difficulties. He can, of course, be kept
here, and will be kept here till he is no longer required, but with
a man in Standish's position instituting inquiries and pushing them
hard, there is bound to be a considerable hue and cry. It will
naturally be done through the Embassy. And so I would like to
curtail the time before we strike as much as possible. Everything
is in train: I was only waiting because for many reasons September
is the most suitable time of year. But Denver's presence overrides
everything. Therefore I propose to do the thing
immediately&mdash;that is, say, in a fortnight. Does that suit
you?"</p>

<p>"Anything, my dear Signor, suits me," said Zavier languidly, "so
long as the money is forthcoming. But I doubt," he continued with a
little chuckle, "if it will suit Felton Blake."</p>

<p>Berendosi frowned.</p>

<p>"Is he likely to give trouble?"</p>

<p>"People with whom I deal never give trouble," remarked Zavier.
"But, as I think I told you before, one of his conditions was that
he should be allowed to further his ridiculous love affair. To
return, however, to Standish for the moment. You say he does not
know the truth."</p>

<p>"At present&mdash;no. How long that state of affairs will
continue I can't say&mdash;nor does it really matter very much. As
a matter of fact I was surprised when I found out he didn't.
Countess Mazarin&mdash;a lady who has no affection for me&mdash;was
travelling with his friend Carteret to Paris the day before
yesterday, and I fully expected she had told him.
But&mdash;apparently not. And so, my dear Monsieur Zavier, if you
would be good enough to deliver the goods within the next few days
I think we shall soon be able to congratulate ourselves on a
successfully planned and still more successfully executed
coup."</p>

<p>"I shall await the result with interest, Signor," murmured
Zavier, glancing at his watch. "And since there would appear to be
nothing further to discuss, I think I will return to my hotel.
Unless, that is, you could give me a little dinner here?"</p>

<p>"Delighted," said Gregoroff. "We three will feed alone, leaving
the stage set for the other two."</p>

<p>He gave an odious chuckle, and Zavier glanced at him
thoughtfully. An unpleasant specimen, he reflected: a hanger-on, a
cringer. For Berendosi he had the respect that one strong,
unscrupulous man feels for another of the same kidney: for
Gregoroff he felt nothing but contempt. But his face was
expressionless as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I shall be interested to see the play," he said suavely.</p>

<p>"You have fixed everything?" asked Berendosi.</p>

<p>"Everything," answered Gregoroff. "The curtain rises at ten. And
in case the leading man becomes annoyed with his part, I have six
strong supers in readiness to soothe him down."</p>

<p>"There is the castle you want."</p>

<p>Andrew Mackintosh, correspondent for the <i>Planet</i>, halted
his ancient Fiat and indicated the place with a large hand.</p>

<p>"I will drive no nearer, for this damned machine makes a noise
like a tank. And may God help you on your nefarious undertaking. I
will await you here."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Andy," said Standish, getting out of the car.
"But we may be the devil of a time."</p>

<p>"Mon&mdash;the night is warm, and I have a flask. But dinna
forget that I have a wife and bairns, and if trouble arises, as I'm
thinking it will, we are perfect strangers. I will turn the car
round, and I will wait till dawn. But if you're no here before
then, I shall be away back to Dalzburg."</p>

<p>"Stout fellow," said Standish. "Come on, Tiny: it's dark enough
to start."</p>

<p>From the back of the car he took out a coil of rope which he
slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Got your torch, Tiny? And little Willie? Right&mdash;come
on."</p>

<p>He had from the first decided against taking fire-arms, and
little Willie was the substitute. And no mean substitute either. It
consisted of a piece of stout rubber with a lump of lead at the
end, which when connected with the base of a man's skull, produced
oblivion for as long or short a period as desired. It also produced
oblivion in silence, an essential factor if they were to succeed
that night.</p>

<p>It was Mackintosh who had suggested the rope, and lent them a
coil of his own.</p>

<p>"It may be no use," he had remarked, "but it's no trouble to
carry, and maybe it will come in handy. Supposing they mean to keep
him there, they will put him in a top room. And perhaps you can
find a way of getting it up to him. But it's going to be a
difficult and a dangerous business."</p>

<p>A fact of which they were both aware. Not that the danger
deterred them: as Standish had pointed out, it was not danger in
the accepted sense of the word. But it was essential that they
should not be caught because of the consequences. They were putting
themselves outside the pale of even Bessonian law: they were doing
a thing which rendered them liable to sample the inside of a prison
for months. And once there, there they would remain until
everything was over.</p>

<p>So strongly did Standish feel it that he again impressed it on
Tiny as they moved cautiously forward.</p>

<p>"It's got to be stealth, Tiny," he muttered. "Stealth and
cunning ail the time. We must only use force as absolutely our last
resource."</p>

<p>The ground rose fairly abruptly from the road, which helped them
considerably as far as cover was concerned, and a steep bank about
six feet high on the edge of the drive allowed them to get to
within thirty yards of the castle. Fortunately for them there was
no moon, and they could lie against the bank with their heads above
it without fear of being seen. A light was filtering out from two
rooms, one almost directly in front of them on the ground floor,
the other some way to the left on the first. Heavy curtains covered
both windows, so that it was impossible to see who was inside,
though once a man put his head out of the upper one and stared
round.</p>

<p>Suddenly a woman's laugh rang out from the room opposite, and
they heard Denver's voice in answer.</p>

<p>"Evidently they haven't aroused his suspicions yet," whispered
Standish in Tiny's ear. "Hullo! the other light has gone out."</p>

<p>Once more silence fell, broken only by the low murmur of
conversation from across the drive. Five minutes passed&mdash;ten,
when Tiny gripped Standish's arm.</p>

<p>"Look," he whispered. "Away to the left. Someone smoking."</p>

<p>Sure enough from some distance away there came the even glow of
a cigarette. The smoker was standing motionless: they could see the
little lines of light as he lifted it to and from his mouth.</p>

<p>"In front of us, Tiny," breathed Standish in his ear. "Between
the man smoking and the room where Denver is. There are half a
dozen of them."</p>

<p>They peered into the darkness, and at last he picked them up.
They were standing bunched together not far from the window, and it
seemed to him they were waiting? But, what for?</p>

<p>Boom! From a clock tower above rang out the first note of the
hour, and instantly things began to happen. The smoker flung away
his cigarette: two shadowy figures detached themselves from the
group opposite and moved swiftly towards the window. There they
paused, and began adjusting something that looked like a tripod.
And when at length the last note of the clock had quivered into
silence, all was as before save that the smoker no longer smoked,
and the thing that looked like a tripod was in position.</p>

<p>"Standing by for the clock," muttered Standish, "to cover the
noise. What's going to happen now?"</p>

<p>They had not long to wait for the answer. Suddenly the curtains
parted, and a woman's arm showed for a moment through them. They
saw two men spring forward to the tripod: then the curtains swung
back revealing the whole room. And for a moment they could hardly
believe their eyes. Seated beside the table, a look of stupefied
amazement on his face, was Joe Denver. On her knees at his feet,
her arms thrown round him, her face buried against his chest was a
woman. It might have been a <i>tableau vivant</i> representing "The
anguish of a woman in love." And even as they watched in
astonishment there came the blinding flash of magnesium, and the
mystery was solved. A flashlight photograph had been taken.</p>

<p>"Ronald," whispered Tiny, "it's the Queen."</p>

<p>"Rot," said Standish. "It's someone whose back view looks like
the Queen. We've got to get that camera. Hullo! things move."</p>

<p>The door of the room opened and Gregoroff stood there, his eyes
blazing. And slowly the woman rose from her knees and faced him,
trembling.</p>

<p>"So, Madame," he thundered, "I have caught you, have I?"</p>

<p>"Holy Smoke," muttered Ronald, "that wheeze came out of the ark
with Noah. But we've got to miss it for a bit, Tiny. The camera man
is away to the left. After him."</p>

<p>Like shadows they faded into the darkness. From behind them came
the sound of Gregoroff's angry voice, and Joe Denver's stammered
answers, but they paid no attention. The camera was their
objective, and they caught its owner, a little rat of a man, just
as he was turning in at the front door. He gave one squeal like a
frightened rabbit; then Tiny's vast hand closed over his mouth.</p>

<p>"Take the camera, Ronald," he said in a low voice. "I've
collared the excrescence."</p>

<p>"Right, old boy. I've got it. And here's the plate."</p>

<p>There came the crack of breaking glass&mdash;the sound of the
pieces being thrown into the bushes. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"What now, Ronald? What are we to do with this thing?"</p>

<p>"We've got to dot him one, Tiny. Otherwise he'll give us away.
Hold his head forward."</p>

<p>And with the skill born of practice Ronald Standish laid him
out.</p>

<p>"Into the bushes with him. And his camera too. Now we've got to
get young Denver out of it."</p>

<p>They reached the cover of the bank again, and crept back to
their original point of vantage. Two of the men who had been
outside the window were now inside the room, but they could see the
other four in readiness close at hand. The girl was no longer
there: only Gregoroff, still simulating righteous anger, faced the
utterly bewildered youth.</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir, there is some extraordinary mistake," Denver
was saying. "I have never met your wife before in my life."</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe that," sneered Gregoroff. "You expect
me to believe that my wife asked a perfect stranger to dine with
her! Explain why you came, if what you say is true."</p>

<p>"I came to..." Denver paused: then he threw back his head. "Damn
you," he shouted, "go to Hell. It doesn't matter why I came. What
are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"We will decide that later," said Gregoroff icily. "In the
meantime you shall be shown your quarters for the night. Take him
away."</p>

<p>"Let's rush 'em, Ronald," muttered Tiny, but Standish shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Odds too great, old boy. Eight of them, and the betting is
they've got guns. We must wait and hope for the best. But, by God!
they're a bunch of swine."</p>

<p>The two men rushed Denver out of the room, and Gregoroff leant
back in his chair shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>"My dear," he chuckled as the door opened and his daughter came
in, "I congratulate you. He doesn't know whether he is on his head
or his heels, in fact he has visions of fighting a duel with me.
Where are the others?"</p>

<p>"Just coming," she said, lighting a cigarette. "I think it went
off very well."</p>

<p>"Capitally: capitally. Ah! my dear Berendosi, the stage has lost
a shining light."</p>

<p>He pointed to his daughter, and Berendosi bowed.</p>

<p>"In order that we may enjoy it more fully," he murmured. "So it
was successful. You hear that, Zavier?"</p>

<p>And Tiny suddenly found Standish's hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"That man who has just come in, Tiny." His voice was shaking
with excitement. "With the monkey on his shoulder. Can it be
possible? Damn it! it must be." He relapsed into silence. "Let's
listen."</p>

<p>"Admirable," said Zavier. "And where is the young man now?"</p>

<p>"Where he is likely to remain for a time," laughed Berendosi.
"Locked in upstairs. Those men needn't wait, Gregoroff. Well," he
continued as the group outside the window dispersed, "I think we
have every reason to congratulate ourselves. Everything has gone
off without a hitch. I would keep up the fiction as long as you
can, Gregoroff, though I fear he is bound to suspect sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"You intend to produce him at the crucial moment, I presume,"
said Zavier.</p>

<p>"Exactly. I fear he may have an unpleasant time at the hands of
my outraged fellow-countrymen, but it will be in an excellent
cause. Well, Zavier&mdash;I think we might return to Dalzburg. Good
night, dear lady, and a thousand thanks for your assistance."</p>

<p>He bowed over her hand, and the three men left the room. And
shortly after the girl followed them.</p>

<p>"It's now or never, Tiny," said Standish. "They've put him up in
that tower; you can see the light. Are you on?"</p>

<p>"You bet I'm on," grunted the other. "Let's move."</p>

<p>Keeping in the shadow beyond the light thrown from the window,
they darted across the drive and into the now empty room. The door
was open and Standish peered out. From one end of the passage came
voices, and without hesitation he led the way in the opposite
direction till he came to a flight of stairs. And a moment or two
later they were both on the first landing.</p>

<p>"Passages too damned well lit," he muttered. "We've got to make
the fourth floor at least."</p>

<p>They darted up the next flight: then the third, and there
Standish paused. From above them came the sound of voices and the
chink of money.</p>

<p>"They will be guarding his door," he whispered to Tiny. "Wade
in&mdash;but do it silently. My God! look out."</p>

<p>Flattened into a little recess, hardly daring to breathe, they
watched Gregoroff himself go past them so close that they could
almost have touched him. He went up the next flight, and they heard
his voice.</p>

<p>"All right, is he?"</p>

<p>"Fought like a madman," came the answer, "but he's quieter now.
He started trying to break the door down, but I guess he hurt
himself more than the door."</p>

<p>"You'll be relieved in a couple of hours. Leave him alone unless
he starts shouting. Then gag him."</p>

<p>Once again Gregoroff passed close to the recess where Standish
and Tiny were crouching, and they waited until his footsteps died
away downstairs.</p>

<p>"Now, Tiny," whispered Standish, "we've got to hurry. That
camera merchant may come to at any moment. But for Heaven's
sake&mdash;no noise."</p>

<p>Cautiously&mdash;step by step&mdash;they crept up the last
flight. And this time luck was with them: the passage, save for one
light under which two men were playing cards, was in darkness. They
were engrossed in their game, and the thing was over in a flash.
Two dull thudding blows, and the card players rolled gently off
their chairs on to the floor.</p>

<p>"I've got the key," said Standish, "and that must be the door
where the light is. By Gad! old boy, I believe we're going to pull
it off."</p>

<p>He turned the lock, and they went in to find Joe Denver sitting
disconsolately on his bed. He sprang to his feet with a cry of
amazement when he saw who they were, but Standish silenced him at
once.</p>

<p>"Move, young fellow, and move quickly. Good Lord! what's
that?"</p>

<p>Through the open window came an uproar from below, and he looked
out.</p>

<p>"Tiny, they've found the camera bloke. It will have to be the
rope."</p>

<p>He darted to the door and locked it: already the sound of
footsteps could be heard rushing up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Put that wardrobe against the door," he said curtly. "I'll fix
this."</p>

<p>He lashed one end of the rope to a leg of the bed, and threw the
rest of the coil out of the window.</p>

<p>"Now, Denver, down you go. Don't argue, damn you: move. Go into
the main road and get into a car you'll find there. We're after you
at once."</p>

<p>Crash after crash was coming from the other side of the door,
and it was obvious it could not hold much longer.</p>

<p>"After him, Tiny. Quick, man, quick."</p>

<p>He gave him two seconds: then he too clambered out and started
to swarm down. And even as he dropped out of sight, the door above
him gave way.</p>

<p>"Drop freely," he shouted; all pretence of concealment was
useless now. "They'll cut the rope."</p>

<p>But luck held. The heavy wardrobe delayed their pursuers
sufficiently to let Denver and Tiny reach the ground, and when at
last they did get to the rope and cut it Standish had only some ten
feet to fall.</p>

<p>"Run like hell," he said curtly.</p>

<p>Panting and breathless they reached the car to find Mackintosh
had started the engine.</p>

<p>"I thought I observed a slight commotion," he remarked as they
fell in. "We'll have to hop it, boys: yon man Gregoroff has a
powerful car."</p>

<p>"And, by Jove! Andy," said Standish, when they had covered a
couple of miles, "he's let it loose. Give her every ounce you
can."</p>

<p>"Hopeless, mon, hopeless. But bide a while: there's a turn a
little way ahead."</p>

<p>Suddenly he swung the car right-handed up a narrow lane, and
then switched off his lights.</p>

<p>"He has a Hispano," he explained; "I could never have got away
from him. What happens if he spots us?"</p>

<p>"We fight," said Standish tersely. "Here they come."</p>

<p>Exhaust open, head-lights flaring, the car roared past them
crammed with men, and not until the noise of the engine had died
away in the distance did they breathe freely again.</p>

<p>"And now," remarked Mackintosh, "we go back on our tracks. We
can make a detour which will bring us into Dalzburg by another
road. Otherwise I'm thinking we may meet them coming back."</p>

<p>The castle was blazing with lights as they approached, and
suddenly Mackintosh cursed under his breath. Three men were
standing across the road holding out their arms.</p>

<p>"Drive at 'em, Andy," cried Standish. "Denver, get down:
hide."</p>

<p>And Andy Mackintosh drove at them, all out. Came a thud on the
mudguard, a brief vision of jumping, swearing men and the castle
was left behind them.</p>

<p>"And me&mdash;a respectable married journalist," groaned Andy.
"I'm hoping they did not get my number."</p>

<p>"You see the trouble you've caused, young fellah," said Standish
to Denver with a laugh. "However, it looks as if the first hurdle
was safely over."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake tell me what it's all about," cried the
youngster. "My brain is in an absolute whirl."</p>

<p>"All in good time," said Standish. "Let's get back first."</p>

<p>"But they'll be watching the hotel," said Denver.</p>

<p>"That's why we're not going there. Or at any rate you're not.
You are going to bed down, any way for a time, with the excellent
Andy."</p>

<p>"And after that comes the second hurdle," said that worthy
gloomily. "Dinna forget that."</p>

<p>"You damned old croaker," laughed Standish, "we'll think of
something."</p>

<p>But though he spoke cheerfully, he was far from feeling it. No
one realized better than he did that the second hurdle was going to
be considerably harder than the first. For it consisted of getting
Joe Denver out of the country. Luck, astounding luck, had been with
them so far: how long would it last? Obviously every frontier post
would be watched, and Denver would simply be arrested on some
trumped-up charge and returned to Berendosi. It was true that he
might lie hidden for a time with Andy Mackintosh, but that was only
postponing the evil. And two things made him unwilling to leave him
there longer than absolutely necessary. First, it seemed probable
that Berendosi would get him and Tiny out of the country as soon as
possible, which would mean leaving Denver on his own. And second,
though Andy had not hesitated for a moment to come in with them, he
was, as he had said, a respectable married journalist, not too well
off at that. And the last thing Standish wanted to do was to get
him into trouble.</p>

<p>The devil of it was that the problem seemed almost insoluble.
And yet there must be some way of smuggling the youngster out. One
trouble was that he did not speak a word of the language. Still,
surely there must be some method. But he was still racking his
brains for an answer when the car drew up at Mackintosh's
house.</p>

<p>It was past one, and the street was deserted. There was no sign
of anyone watching the house, so that even if the men they had
driven at had got the number of the car, as yet it had not been
traced.</p>

<p>"I'll put the car away," said Andy. "You go in."</p>

<p>His wife opened the door to them: a homely, sweet-faced Scotch
woman.</p>

<p>"But you've got him," she cried. "Good. Come in, and have a
drink."</p>

<p>"You've guessed right there, Mrs. Andy," laughed Standish. "And
here's the young blighter who is responsible for all the
trouble."</p>

<p>She smiled at Joe Denver, and then led the way upstairs.</p>

<p>"I thought it would be safer above," she explained, "in case
they started to watch the house."</p>

<p>"You're a marvel," cried Standish. "We would never have pulled
it off without you and Andy. Now, young fellow," he went on, "let's
hear how they got you to walk into their parlour so easily."</p>

<p>"They sent me a note to say that ... that ..." He hesitated for
a moment and glanced at Mrs. Mackintosh.</p>

<p>"You can speak out freely," said Standish. "Mrs. Andy
knows."</p>

<p>"To say that the Queen was in danger, and would I go at once.
There would be a car waiting in the square, and I was to tell no
one."</p>

<p>"And into that singularly obvious trap," laughed Standish, "you
walked with both your great flat feet. Ah! well, perhaps I'd have
done the same."</p>

<p>"But what was the meaning of all that damned foolery?" cried
Denver. "That flashlight photograph, and the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Young fellah," said Standish gravely, "we're in pretty deep
waters&mdash;you especially. The whole of this evening's
performance was staged with the express purpose of getting a
photograph of you with a woman in your arms, who in colouring and
size might easily have been the Queen."</p>

<p>"The infernal swine," said Denver savagely. "What are we to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about the photograph. Tiny and I attended to that.
The point to be decided is what are we to do about you."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Andy, helping himself to whisky. "That's the
point."</p>

<p>"We've got to get you out of the country somehow, Denver, and do
it damned quick. For if they get you a second time, they'll keep
you."</p>

<p>"But if you've smashed the photo what does it matter?" cried
Denver. "They won't get another."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," agreed Standish. "But there's something else
behind it all, though at present we don't know what. It's not a
letter; Tiny found that out. What is it? Countess Mazarin could
tell us..."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," interrupted Mrs. Andy. "I rang her up as you
told me, and promised to ring her up again if all went well."</p>

<p>"Bit late, isn't it, my dear," said her husband doubtfully.</p>

<p>"She told me to ring her whatever time you came back," she
said.</p>

<p>"Well, be careful what you say, Mrs. Andy," warned Standish.
"Telephones at this hour of the night are dangerous."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I was in a sort of daze," cried Denver as she left
the room. "The whole thing seems like some mad nightmare."</p>

<p>"It's going to be madder soon," said Andy gravely. "It's getting
mighty near, if I'm any judge."</p>

<p>"What is?" asked Denver.</p>

<p>"Hell let loose. Civil war. Well, my dear, did you get
through?"</p>

<p>"I did. And she's coming here."</p>

<p>"The devil she is," said Andy uneasily. He went to the window
and peered out. "I don't see anyone at present, but pray the Lord
she's not followed."</p>

<p>"Hardly likely, Andy, at this hour," said Standish. "They've got
no cause to suspect her."</p>

<p>"Mon, this place is a hot-bed of spies and intrigue," answered
the other. "And the Palace is the worst spot of the lot. However,
we can but hope for the best."</p>

<p>"And at any rate, Andy, we'll know at last. That's worth running
a bit of risk for. Though it's not going to help us over this
blighter's immediate future."</p>

<p>"But what's the difficulty?" cried Denver. "I'll go to-morrow,
if you want me to."</p>

<p>Standish laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," he said, "every frontier has been closed to you
days ago. There are no strings you can pull at all, Andy, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I've been racking my brains, Ronald, and I'm just phased. It's
a fair snorter. He can stop here, of course, but after a time the
servants are bound to talk."</p>

<p>"No, no, Andy," said Standish, "if we can't get him away we must
find somewhere else. If necessary he must go like the Biblical
gentleman, into the mountains with the ravens."</p>

<p>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"They'll go through the country with a tooth-comb," he said.</p>

<p>"I seem a damned popular bird," remarked Denver ruefully. "What
exactly are they going to do with me when they do get me?"</p>

<p>"Produce you as an exhibit at the psychological moment," said
Standish. "Though now that that photograph is destroyed it seems to
me you lose a good deal of your value. Unless..."</p>

<p>And at that moment the front-door bell rang.</p>

<p>"It's the Countess," said Andy, peering through the window.
"I'll go and let her in."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven you've got him," she cried a little breathlessly
as she entered the room. "I've made all the arrangements for a fast
car to get him away."</p>

<p>"Hopeless, Countess," cried Standish. "The frontier will be
closed. We should simply play into their hands."</p>

<p>"But we must get him away," she said. "We <i>must</i>. What
happened to-night?"</p>

<p>He told her briefly, and when he'd finished she opened her
bag.</p>

<p>"The only comfort," concluded Standish, "is that the photo was
destroyed."</p>

<p>"Comfort," she cried. "Precious little comfort, Mr. Standish.
The one they took to-night may have been destroyed, but this one
hasn't."</p>

<p>She threw a faded print on the table, and they crowded
round.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Standish. "So that's the trouble. How did you
get hold of this?"</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," muttered Denver, scarlet to the roots
of his hair. "It's the day I said good-bye to her. What damned
ineffable swine took this?"</p>

<p>"Steady, Denver," cried Standish. "Don't tear it up. It's more
serious even than I thought, but at any rate we know what we're up
against, at last."</p>

<p>"But who took the damned thing?" said Denver between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"Immaterial, young fellow," remarked Standish shortly. "Good
Lord! you might both have posed specially for it."</p>

<p>Which was no more than the truth. For the photograph showed a
little glade in a wood. Two people were standing in it, their arms
round one another. Their profiles were towards the camera, and the
woman was looking up into the man's face with an expression which
caused the warm-hearted Mrs. Andy to wipe her eyes surreptitiously,
and whisper, "You poor bairns." For the woman in the photograph was
the Queen: the man was the youngster who now stood with his back to
them, staring out of the window.</p>

<p>"At any rate," repeated Standish, "we know what we're up
against. Now, Countess, we'd very much like to hear your side of
the story, because there is a good deal that is still mighty
obscure. And incidentally, Denver, come away from that window. Your
face is a darned sight too well known in this country."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"THERE'S not much to tell," she began. "I got it
about two months ago by sheer luck. I had been out motoring one
day, driving my own car, and I ran out of petrol. I was miles from
a garage, but as luck would have it I was only about ten minutes'
walk from the Castle of Birenden, which is Berendosi's country
house. It was a case of needs must, or else nothing would have
induced me to ask the brute for anything. But if I was to get home
at all I'd have to borrow some petrol from him. It was a pitch dark
night, and stiflingly hot, and the house was in darkness save for
one room on the ground floor, from which a light shone out through
partially drawn curtains. I knew the place fairly well, because
Berendosi entertains lavishly, and the room which was lit up was
either the dining-room or his study. And acting on the spur of the
moment, instead of ringing the bell, I crossed the lawn towards it.
I intended to ask him for the petrol, and for a man to carry it to
the car.</p>

<p>"When I got close to I heard voices, and I don't quite know why,
I hesitated for a moment or two. Somehow I had expected to find him
alone and now it looked as if he had a dinner-party. And then I
heard one remark of Berendosi's that made me go cold all over.</p>

<p>"'What about that for proof, Gregoroff? Our gracious Majesty
herself.'</p>

<p>"Now I give you my word that up to that moment I'd had no
intention of spying or listening. I had crossed the lawn quite
openly with no pretence at concealment, and in another second I
should have appeared in the open window. I'd really forgotten all
about everything except that I'd run out of petrol. And to hear a
remark like that suddenly when one wasn't in the least expecting
it, brought me up with a start.</p>

<p>"My first inclination was to go back and ring the front-door
bell, but I soon decided not to. Eavesdropping it might be but I
was going to find out all I could. Evidently I had not been seen
crossing the lawn, and if anyone came to the window and I was
discovered, I should have to put as good a face on the matter as I
could. So I crept a little closer until I could just see into the
room. There were three of them inside: Berendosi, Gregoroff and a
third whom I had never seen before. He was the most strange-looking
individual&mdash;completely bald with a high, domed forehead. But
the most peculiar thing about him was that on his shoulder there
sat a little monkey, which he fondled continuously. Did you say
anything, Mr. Standish?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Countess. It will keep."</p>

<p>"This man was smoking a cigarette and watching the other two,
who were poring over something that was lying on the desk in the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>"'Marvellous,' said Gregoroff at length. 'My dear Paul, I
congratulate you. And you also, Monsieur.'</p>

<p>"Then he picked the thing up, and I saw what it was&mdash;an
unmounted photograph. I didn't know what to do. At first I didn't
understand what it was all about. I couldn't see what the
photograph was, though I guessed from Berendosi's remark that it
was a snapshot of the Queen. But as they went on talking I realized
that it must be more than that.</p>

<p>"'Do you know who the young man is, Monsieur Zavier?' asked
Berendosi of the bald-headed man.</p>

<p>"'I have forgotten,' he answered. 'I was told, but for the
moment it has slipped my memory. I can, however, easily find that
out, and let you know.'</p>

<p>"They talked on for a while, and then Gregoroff lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"'A quarter of a million is a lot of money, Monsieur,' he said
to this man Zavier.</p>

<p>"'A lot is a relative term,' answered the other. 'My dear sir,'
he added contemptuously, 'you don't suppose I deal in children's
saving accounts, do you? That is my figure, and you can take it or
leave it. I told Signor Berendosi weeks ago that I would deliver
the goods as I had promised. There is a proof of it: though to be
on the safe side,' he added with a smile, 'it is only an unfixed
proof, which will fade. But at the appointed time you shall have
the genuine article. And it is for you to arrange that time: it is
not my affair.'</p>

<p>"You can imagine, Mr. Standish, that by this time I was nearly
crazy. I still had no idea what was in the picture, beyond the fact
that there was a man and Olga. But it was pretty clear that if a
quarter of a million was the price, there must be something more in
it than that. And I stood there racking my brains as to how I could
get hold of it and see. They had left it lying on the desk: in two
seconds I could have darted in and picked it up. And I very nearly
did. After all they couldn't hurt me, and at any rate I should know
the worst.</p>

<p>"And then, just as I was nerving myself to do so, the whole sky
was lit up by lightning and almost simultaneously came the crash of
thunder overhead. It was one of our usual mountain storms, but it
was a particularly fierce one. There was no rain, but the wind got
up like a tornado. The curtains flapped wildly: the monkey
jibbered, but all that I had eyes for was that photograph. For it
had blown off the desk, and was lying just inside the window not a
yard away from me. And then I had a stroke of luck. There came
another terrific gust of wind and the lamp blew over. So I made one
grab at the photo and fled. The lightning was almost continuous, so
I kept in as close to the house as I could. Two of them had dashed
into the garden and were peering round in every direction, leaving
the other one, I suppose, to attend to the lamp. But I dodged along
as quickly as I could and they neither of them saw me. And at last
I got in among the trees bordering the drive, and felt safe."</p>

<p>"Well done, Countess," said Standish. "It was a ticklish
situation. And they have never suspected you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they don't. They imagine it blew away in the gale. At
any rate a car came along as I was standing there, and I borrowed
some petrol and drove home in a sort of daze. What was to be done
about it? And the more I thought the more hopeless did it appear.
I'd got one print it was true, but there must be others in
existence. And so beyond making myself half sick with worry I'd
really accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>"There was no one I could turn to for help. I didn't say a word,
of course, to Olga&mdash;that would have been too cruel. She could
have done nothing, and if the blow had got to fall it might just as
well be unexpected. And it was no good trying to console myself
with the idea that the picture was harmless since it had been taken
before Olga's wedding. Berendosi is far too clever a man to let a
trifle like that bother him. I was distracted until, out of the
blue came Mary Ridgeway. She was someone I could confide in, at any
rate.</p>

<p>"Judge, then, of my amazement when I found she knew all about it
and was dumbfounded to find that I did. It appeared that a man in
London&mdash;you know, Mr. Carteret, Felton Blake&mdash;had written
to her begging for an interview. She had met him at some party or
another, and since he said it was of vital importance that he
should see her she allowed him to call. He apparently went straight
to the point and produced a copy of the photo.</p>

<p>"She was as much bowled over as I was when she saw it, and
demanded how he came to have such a thing. He told her it had come
into his possession by roundabout means."</p>

<p>"More than likely," said Standish dryly.</p>

<p>"So she asked him what he was going to do with it.</p>

<p>"'Why burn it, of course,' he answered, and did so then and
there.</p>

<p>"'But then why, Mr. Blake, bother to come and show it to me?'
she cried.</p>

<p>"'Because, Lady Mary,' he explained, 'I wanted to show you the
intense gravity of the situation. To make a print there must be a
film. And I have the best of reasons for believing that that film
is in existence.'"</p>

<p>"The very best," said Standish with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"You mean..." she said, staring at him.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you the rest? Our Mr. Felton Blake, appalled by
the vileness of the scoundrel who had taken such a photograph,
ranged himself on the side of virtue. He somehow or other would get
hold of that film: he somehow or other would see that it was
destroyed, and any other prints that might be in existence."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, he has found one more print," she
said.</p>

<p>"It would be equally easy for him to find a dozen," said
Standish grimly. "My dear Countess, I am not a wealthy man, but I
would cheerfully wager a thousand pounds to a sixpence that I could
lead you to that film now. It is where it has always been&mdash;in
Felton Blake's safe."</p>

<p>"But if that is so," she cried pathetically, "it's our last hope
gone. Or do you think he's only trying to make it seem harder, so
as to..."</p>

<p>Her eyes met Tiny's and he laughed savagely.</p>

<p>"So as to ingratiate himself with Mary?" he said.</p>

<p>"More than likely," said Standish. "But don't delude yourself
into thinking that when the ingratiating period can no longer be
prolonged he is going to hand over the film. Unless, of course...
Do you really think, Tiny, that the swine is in love with Lady
Mary?"</p>

<p>Tiny waved his hand at the Countess.</p>

<p>"There is my informant," he said shortly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Standish, I do," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then it is possible that Felton Blake might drive the bargain.
It's quite in keeping with the man's character. If she will marry
him, then she gets the film as a wedding present."</p>

<p>"The ineffable swine," muttered Tiny.</p>

<p>"Agreed, old lad," said Standish. "But we've got to take the
facts as they are. And I'm bound to say they look just about as
grim as they can."</p>

<p>"But, good God!" exploded Joe Denver, "we can put the police on
to him."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Standish quietly. "What are you going to
charge him with? Having that photograph in his possession doesn't
constitute a crime. That's the devil of it, young fellah. As I see
the matter at present, they are absolutely within the law."</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence, tapping his teeth with the stem of his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Let's try and get things in order," he remarked at length.
"Somehow or other Blake has got hold of an incriminating
photograph. As the Countess quite rightly observed, the fact that
it was taken before a certain marriage is of no account. Berendosi,
as she says, is far too clever a man to let that worry him. So
little in fact does it do so that he is prepared to pay a quarter
of a million for it to this man Zavier... And Zavier is a very
interesting gentleman."</p>

<p>"I gathered you had seen him before to-night," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"He did me the honour of being somewhat curious over my
movements when I was staying in Territet. I don't think he realized
I had spotted his interest, but it is a game which two can play.
Then he vanished, and I dismissed him from my mind. But now we hear
from the Countess that he was the actual man who offered the photo
to Berendosi months ago. Very interesting."</p>

<p>"Why particularly?" demanded Tiny.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that Felton Blake would have given away the
handling of a show involving a quarter of a million unless he had
to? That he would have passed it over to one of the smaller
fry&mdash;one of his own equals? Not he. He would have negotiated
himself, and pocketed the whole of the boodle. Don't you see what
that means, Tiny? It means, unless I am vastly mistaken, that at
last we have found our bird. Zavier is the big man. However, that
will all keep for the moment. Let us concentrate on the immediate
issue. Andy, you are more in touch with things here than we are.
What is your candid opinion of the situation?"</p>

<p>The journalist puffed thoughtfully at his pipe.</p>

<p>"With that film in his possession," he said at length,
"Berendosi has the game in his hands. It's fool proof. Things are
on the edge of a precipice now: with that photograph comes the
landslide."</p>

<p>"But why?" cried Denver. "All he can do is to show it to his
friends."</p>

<p>"Laddie," answered Andy gravely, "he can show it to the whole
country. What is to prevent him having thousands of copies made,
till your face is as familiar as Charlie Chaplin's? He can
distribute them broadcast through the land. And had Ronald not
smashed the plate to-night there would have been a pair. The plot
is as clear as the nose on your face. And your arrival here has
given it the finishing touch. Not only will they distribute the
photograph, but they will produce the original."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Andy," said Standish. "It's incredibly
simple, and incredibly sure. <i>And it must not be</i>. But how the
devil we're going to prevent it, I, at the moment, do not see. By
the way, Countess, how did you know Mr. Denver was here?"</p>

<p>"I told my very greatest friend, Mr. Standish, about the
photograph and showed it to her. And she by chance saw Mr. Denver
here in the hotel. She thought she recognized him, and when she saw
the name in the book she knew at once. So she wired me in Paris and
I wired Mr. Carteret. I hoped he would be able to persuade him to
go at once, if I couldn't. And now it's too late..."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that. There must be some way."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Denver quietly, "don't go ahead too fast. If
that entrancing exhibition of beastliness Berendosi is going to
flood the country with copies of that photograph, I'm going to be
here."</p>

<p>"Very understandable, old lad," said Standish, "but it won't do.
Any man would feel the same. But it's one of those cases where not
only could you do no good, but you'd do an enormous amount of harm.
It would at once appear as proof that the affair was still going
on. No; I sympathize with you. But if we can manage it you have got
to be removed from here. And it's easier said than done."</p>

<p>"Well, if you've all quite finished talking," said Mrs. Andy
quietly, "I'll tell you how to do it."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Maggie," said her husband, reaching for the
whisky. "Come into the office, boys, for you can bet it is all
settled."</p>

<p>And when twenty minutes later Standish and Tiny strolled back to
their hotel, it seemed to them that there was at least a sixty per
cent chance of her scheme succeeding. Denver had remained with the
Mackintoshs: the Countess had gone home, and the most searching
examination had failed to reveal any sign of men watching the
house. In fact, up to date everything seemed to have gone
splendidly, and yet Standish seemed gloomy and depressed.</p>

<p>"It's worse&mdash;far worse than I thought, Tiny. It's
fool-proof, as Andy said&mdash;once they get that photo, even if
young Denver isn't in the country. A letter would have been bad
enough, but that photo&mdash;why, good Lord! it's a cinch. And we
don't want a change of regime here."</p>

<p>"I wonder how they got it," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"That we shall probably never know. She was well known by sight,
of course, and someone must have followed them that day. But all
that is only of academic interest. The only thing that matters is
that they <i>have</i> got it, or rather Felton Blake has."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is certain, Ronald. You don't think that
possibly that man Zavier has taken it over by now. Or even
Berendosi himself."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that, and it is undoubtedly a possibility. But
I'll tell you my reasons for thinking Blake still has it. He got it
in the first place, otherwise he would never have come into the
game at all. Now from every point of view it is to his advantage to
hang on to it as long as he can. The more time he gets with Lady
Mary, the better for him. And once that film is out of his
possession, the show here might be sprung under his feet at any
moment."</p>

<p>"It seems sound," said Tiny. "Gad! I'd like to wring the swine's
neck. Ronald, we've damned well got to do these blighters
down."</p>

<p>"And so say all of us, laddie," answered the other with a short
laugh. "Honestly, Tiny, I don't see how we're going to do it. But
there's one thing that is intriguing me at the moment. What line is
our friend Berendosi going to adopt when he sees us? Because he
must know that it was we who did the trick."</p>

<p>They turned into the hotel, and Standish gave a short
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Obvious police spy the first," he muttered, "lurking in corner
of lounge. And behold! he moves at speed. Come into my room, Tiny,
for a night-cap. I'm thinking we may have a visitor, and I wouldn't
like you to miss the fun."</p>

<p>And sure enough a few minutes later there came a knock on the
door.</p>

<p>"My dear Signor," cried Standish, as he opened it, "this is
indeed an unexpected surprise. And&mdash;er&mdash;pleasure. Will
you join us in a little whisky?"</p>

<p>Berendosi, still fully dressed save that he had substituted a
dressing-gown for his coat, came into the room and shut the
door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish," he said shortly, "do we put the cards on the
table, or not?"</p>

<p>"Surely in lives as blameless as ours, there should never be
anything to conceal," remarked the other. "What about a
<i>deoch-an-dorriss</i>?"</p>

<p>Berendosi waved away the proffered drink.</p>

<p>"It isn't poisoned," said Tiny mildly. "We still maintain our
English habits even in this country."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly be silent?" snapped Berendosi. "When I wish you
to speak I will tell you."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Tiny ominously. "And when I wish you to speak to
me like that, I will tell you. But if you do it again, you
rat-faced swab, I'll take you by the scruff of the neck and hang
you out of the window."</p>

<p>"Steady, Tiny," said Standish with a grin, as Berendosi recoiled
against the wall. "But you really must remember, Signor, that my
friend is very large, and choose your words accordingly. Now what
can we do for you?"</p>

<p>With an effort the other recovered his composure.</p>

<p>"I would prefer to discuss the matter alone with you, Mr.
Standish. Your very large friend is, I should imagine, more suited
to the football field than to a matter of this sort."</p>

<p>"The interview is not of my seeking," said Standish curtly. "And
I know of nothing that I wish to discuss with you alone."</p>

<p>"So be it," remarked Berendosi, with a shrug of his shoulders.
"I gather then, from the tone of your remarks, that you do not
propose to put your cards down. It seems a waste of time, but have
it your own way. A few hours ago, Mr. Standish, you and your friend
here forcibly entered the house of a colleague of mine, and removed
a young man whom I require. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that this young man whom we are reputed to
have removed was being detained against his will?" asked
Standish.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Standish," said Berendosi irritably, "what is
the use of this pretence? We are alone together: we all know the
facts of the case. As a clever man, don't you think it would be as
well to have a perfectly straight discussion, and then we can all
go to bed?"</p>

<p>"I am waiting," remarked Standish quietly.</p>

<p>"You are a man whose knowledge of the political situation in
Europe is profound. I am well aware that England does not desire
any change of government here: nevertheless, that change is coming.
You know that as well as I do: hence your presence here. You also
know that by one of those strange turns of Fate, this young man
Denver is a very important person in that change. Therefore you
remove him. Good! I admire you for it. But, Mr. Standish, I require
him back. Where is he?"</p>

<p>Standish laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Your ideas of argument are rather crude, Signor. Even supposing
for a moment that this extraordinary assertion of yours is right,
and that we removed Denver, we must have done it because we wished
to hide him. Why then should we completely negate what we've done
by telling you where we have hidden him? I don't quite see what we
get out of it."</p>

<p>"Then I will explain," said the other. "And I am relieved to see
that we both know where we stand. The point you raise is a
perfectly fair one: the answer, however, is simple. As you will
doubtless have guessed, every frontier post has already been closed
to Mr. Denver. He can leave the country neither by car, by rail,
nor by air. As a further precaution, his passport is being
temporarily taken care of for him. In fact, Mr. Standish, you will
not believe the activity that took place on his utterly unexpected
arrival. I mention these points merely to show that we are in
earnest. Very well then: I will come to the point. For how long do
you think it would be possible for this young man, whose
description has been widely circulated and who cannot speak a word
of the language, to remain hidden?"</p>

<p>"I was never much good at riddles," murmured Standish.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later he is bound to be found. And," continued the
other slowly, "it is for you to decide whether it shall be sooner
or later."</p>

<p>"I may be dense," said Standish, "but I still fail to see the
<i>quid pro quo</i>."</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish&mdash;as a lover of law and order, I know you will
be grieved to hear that a dastardly crime has been committed
to-night. At a house belonging to a high state official two
miscreants nearly killed an inoffensive photographer, forced their
way in, stunned two of the old family retainers and then
decamped&mdash;for all I know with large quantities of valuables.
Justice cries aloud for the names of these criminals, in order that
they may be punished. Do you see now where the <i>quid pro
quo</i>comes in? Should you decide on it's being sooner, I don't
think the names of the criminals are ever likely to be disclosed.
Should you decide on it being later&mdash;well, one of the
criminals was a thick-set man of medium height, the other was a
very large friend of his. Do I make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered Standish. "There is, however, one point
that strikes me, Signor. When these two villains are haled before
the law to answer for their sins, they will naturally give a reason
for their scandalous behaviour. They will say what the photographer
was doing, and people will wonder why. They will say who was there
and all sorts of embarrassing and awkward things, which will
doubtless get into the papers."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Standish, can you possibly believe for an instant
that a man in my responsible position, knowing as I do the
unsettled state of the country, would allow such a thing as that to
get into the papers? You quite pain me. Think of the terrible
example to the youth of the land. No, I fear that the two
miscreants would have no chance of stating their case until
later&mdash;considerably later. And I may further say that amongst
other reforms which are urgently needed here the state of our
prisons leaves much to be desired."</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it?" said Standish, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"That is it, Mr. Standish. I do not think I can make it any
clearer. As I said before, sooner or later Mr. Denver will be
found. For reasons into which we need not enter I would prefer it
to be sooner. I therefore offer you the two alternatives. If you
make it sooner there is a most comfortable train de luxe which
leaves for Paris to-morrow night: if the other, well, as I said,
our gaols are not all they might be."</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do with Denver when you get
him?"</p>

<p>"I can assure you that he will be treated with the utmost
consideration," answered the other. "Be reasonable," he continued
as Standish said nothing. "As a clever man you know that I hold the
top trumps: I've got a winning hand. And clever men cut their
losses under those circumstances. Hand over the young man to me and
clear out. And when things are more settled, believe me we shall be
only too delighted to welcome you back to our country."</p>

<p>"Sooner and later are relative terms, Signor," remarked Standish
abruptly. "By when is this decision to be made?"</p>

<p>For an instant a gleam of triumph showed in Berendosi's eyes,
but his voice was quite casual as he answered.</p>

<p>"Shall we say lunch-time to-morrow, or rather to-day? I have a
most boring function to attend in a few hours at the
aerodrome&mdash;the inauguration of the new service between here
and Le Bourget. So lunch will suit me admirably."</p>

<p>"All right," said Standish, opening the door. "I will tell you
then."</p>

<p>"But let there be no misunderstanding, Mr. Standish," remarked
the other. "I must have proof."</p>

<p>"You shall have proof," said Standish coldly, ignoring
Berendosi's outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Strange men&mdash;you English." The Bessonian's hand fell to
his side. "I thought you were always reputed to take a beating like
a sportsman."</p>

<p>"Only if that beating comes from a sportsman. Signor Berendosi,
it would be idle to pretend that I don't know your game. But it
would be equally idle to pretend that I do not consider you a cad
of the first order. A man who deliberately sets out to obtain his
ends by blackening the reputation of a perfectly innocent woman in
the eyes of the whole world, is not a man whose hand I would ever
shake."</p>

<p>He turned to Tiny as the door closed, and gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"I feel a little better for that, Tiny. Lucky he suggested
lunch: we shall know by then."</p>

<p>"But if it doesn't come off&mdash;are you going to tell the
swine?"</p>

<p>"That he's at Andy's? Yes. It's not fair to them. What Berendosi
said is right&mdash;they're bound to find him in a place like this.
The servants would give it away. And don't be under any delusions
as to what he said about our going to jug. That was no bluff. And
though we may be precious little use out of prison, we'd be even
less inside. So one way or the other we'll tell him at lunch. And
I'll go round to the Embassy in the morning and get Bunny Rogers to
feed, for I'm thinking that if we do pull it off Berendosi will be
as sore as if he'd sat in a hornets' nest. So a little diplomatic
flavouring at the meal may be helpful. Well, good night, old lad.
We'd better get a few hours' sleep."</p>

<p>But though he undressed and got into bed sleep would not come.
Round and round in his brain the problem twisted and turned, and
when the broad light of day was streaming through the window it was
still unsolved. How was the negative of that photo to be procured?
And mixed up with it was another even more important factor. How
was he to get a line on Zavier and hold it?</p>

<p>He felt that his reasoning was correct with regard to that
gentleman. Even if he was not the biggest man of all, he was
considerably nearer that position than Felton Blake. And though he
had made no effort to trace him from Territet&mdash;his suspicions
then had not been aroused&mdash;he was under no delusions as to
what would in all probability have happened if he had. Time and
again had he and others got on the trail of men who they knew
belonged to the gang, in the hope of tracking them to their
headquarters: time and again had those men vanished as completely
as if the earth had swallowed them up. True they had only been
underlings, but if underlings could shake skilled men off their
heels, how much more easily could a man in Zavier's position.</p>

<p>He recalled a case where a man who was known to be a forger in
the employ of the gang was purposely allowed his freedom in the
hopes that he would lead them to their quarry. That man had got on
the boat train at Victoria: he had not got off at Dover. At least
Inspector Mead had been prepared to swear he hadn't. And yet the
run had been non-stop. That it was a disguise of some sort was
obvious, since no man can disappear into thin air. But what was
this disguise that&mdash;not in one isolated case but in
several&mdash;could completely hoodwink some of the shrewdest men
living?</p>

<p>At last he gave up any attempt at sleep and, lighting a
cigarette, he pulled up a chair to the open window. For the moment
he had to dismiss the bigger problem from his mind and concentrate
on the smaller&mdash;how to obtain the negative from Felton Blake.
And after a while he began to laugh gently to himself: there was
only one possible method. Clearly Blake would not hand it over
voluntarily: therefore, there was no good asking for it. Equally
clearly there was no good attempting to obtain it by force: Blake
was a powerful man who would certainly be armed, and who also had
an alarm on his desk which sounded in the rooms of two large
men-servants. He remembered that fact from a previous interview he
had had with him when tempers had become a little frayed. And since
those two methods were both ruled out, there remained only one
other&mdash;the negative must be stolen.</p>

<p>He began to pace thoughtfully up and down the room: was it
feasible? It was a risk&mdash;a very grave risk: on that point he
was under no delusions. If he was caught he would be treated
exactly the same as any ordinary burglar: therefore he must not be
caught. But burglary was a skilled profession and up to date he had
not served an apprenticeship at it. And yet it was worth taking a
big chance&mdash;the issues at stake were so big. Moreover, it was
quite possible that once he got inside Blake's safe other things
would come to light&mdash;things that might lead him to the
headquarters of the gang.</p>

<p>He argued it out in his mind, weighing up the chances. Given
favourable conditions he could deal with the safe, but it was not
going to be an easy matter to get those conditions. Gentlemen of
Felton Blake's mode of living took considerable precautions over
their houses. Still, there was no device yet invented by human
brain, that could not be circumvented by the same agency, and the
more he thought of it the more did it seem to him the only way. In
fact, when he went downstairs after his coffee and rolls his mind
was made up: he was going to try and steal the negative.</p>

<p>Berendosi was in the lounge, and greeted him affably. He
apparently bore no ill feeling over Standish's final remark of a
few hours previously: garbed in a frock-coat and top-hat he oozed
complacency.</p>

<p>"A tedious performance," he remarked, "but <i>pro bono
publico</i>."</p>

<p>"A most apt quotation," said Standish politely. "You are making
a speech?"</p>

<p>"A few words only. Well&mdash;at lunch then, we will resume our
talk."</p>

<p>"Precisely," answered the other with a faint smile. "At
lunch."</p>

<p>Thinking over the bigger problems had almost driven the
immediate point at issue from his mind. And now as he watched
Berendosi enter his car he began to feel doubtful. Would the thing
come off? Its principal hope of success lay in the calm audacity of
the scheme, but now that the actual moment had arrived he didn't
feel quite so confident as he had done the previous night. Right
under Berendosi's nose as Andy had gleefully exclaimed, but was the
nose big enough to hide it? And at that moment Tiny hove in
sight.</p>

<p>"Go off, old man, to the aerodrome," he said, "and see what
happens. I'm going to the Embassy."</p>

<p>He found George Potter pretending to work, and was at once taken
in to the Ambassador.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Standish," cried the latter. "Delighted to see you. What
brings you here, though it isn't hard to guess?"</p>

<p>He listened in silence while Standish told him the whole story,
and his face grew graver and graver.</p>

<p>"Mackintosh is right," he said at the conclusion. "It means the
end. And probably a lot of bloodshed. What on earth induced the boy
to come here?"</p>

<p>"That is the least part of it, sir," remarked Standish. "It is
this damned photograph."</p>

<p>"Well, don't get yourself into trouble, my dear fellow. And take
George along with you to lunch. Gad! I'd give something to see
friend Berendosi's face if you pull it off. And if the blighter
gets gay with you and your pal, George can put it on to me. In
fact, he'd better stop with you till you go."</p>

<p>It was midday when they got back to the hotel, and a quarter of
an hour later Tiny came in grinning all over his face, with Andy
Mackintosh.</p>

<p>"Thumbs up, Ronald," he cried. "Went without a hitch."</p>

<p>"A verra impressive spectacle," said Andy gravely. "In fact I
lapsed into journalese. Like a giant dragon-fly with gossamer wings
outstretched the flying bird lay motionless, gleaming silver in the
sunshine. Soon it would spring to life, and soaring into the blue
empyrean, bear its living cargo over the snow-capped peaks towards
the smiling fields of France, gliding smoothly under the master
hand of the keen-eyed bird-man in control. And then the great
Berendosi himself drew nigh. In a few well-chosen words he painted
a dazzling picture of the future, with Dalzburg not the least
important link in the world flying route. And what of the men who
made such things possible: the intrepid pilot: the clearbrained,
efficient mechanic...."</p>

<p>"For the love of Allah, Andy, shut your mouth on a drink,"
laughed Standish. "For here, if I mistake not, is the bird himself.
George, my boy, we're going to have some fun. Have you ever seen a
finer example of '<i>l'&Eacute;tat, c'est moi</i>'?"</p>

<p>And undoubtedly at the moment Paul Berendosi was feeling that
life was good. The ceremony had gone off swimmingly: the cheers of
the onlookers still rang in his ears. And to crown everything, a
plain-clothes officer had told him as he alighted at the hotel that
the young Englishman he wanted had returned to his room. Evidently
Standish had seen wisdom: now all that remained was to get him and
his boring friend out of the country as soon as possible. He
glanced into the bar, and for a moment a slight feeling of
uneasiness assailed him. The party in there seemed very hilarious
considering they had been beaten all along the line. Someone from
the Embassy, he reflected, and the correspondent of one of the
English papers. And at that moment Standish hailed him.</p>

<p>"I trust everything went well, Signor?"</p>

<p>"Admirably, thank you."</p>

<p>He moved on, his uneasiness increasing. Why on earth were the
four of them looking so pleased? Standish must know that Denver had
returned to the hotel. And just then the police officer came up to
him.</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you, your Excellency?" he said in a low
voice. "There is some mistake. The young man upstairs is in
possession of his passport, and it is in perfect order. And he is
not even an Englishman: he is French."</p>

<p>"What's that?" snarled the other. "Are you certain?"</p>

<p>"But of course, Excellency. I have just been speaking to
him."</p>

<p>"Who is he, you fool? Go and find out."</p>

<p>So Standish was trying the funny stuff, was he? And a sudden
burst of laughter from the bar seemed to bear out the fact. He
moved a few steps to one side so that he could see in: the four men
were examining something intently.</p>

<p>"Come and have a look, Signor," called out Standish. "It's an
excellent one of you, and I know your interest in photography."</p>

<p>Without a word he joined them: an advance press proof of the
morning's proceedings lay on the table. There was the aeroplane,
the passengers, himself, the crowd, but what the devil was the
jest?</p>

<p>"Quite good," he said indifferently.</p>

<p>"Particularly of the mechanic," murmured Standish blandly. "And
I hear you said some very nice things about clear-brained,
efficient mechanics."</p>

<p>Berendosi stood very still: a sudden ghastly suspicion had
assailed him.</p>

<p>"It was verra lucky that such an able substitute could be found
at the last moment," said Andy gravely. "It would have been
terrible, Signor, if your impassioned eloquence had been
wasted."</p>

<p>"May I ask exactly what you are talking about?" said Berendosi
quietly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear?" boomed Tiny cheerfully. "That's too bad. Just
as everything was ready, what should occur but that the mechanic
felt the urge for a drink upon him. So back he trotted to the
hangar with his tongue hanging out. And there who should he find
but another man ready, aye ready! to take his place."</p>

<p>"And the lucky thing was that he had already gone through the
necessary formalities," said Standish. "Because this noble fellow
who was prepared to sacrifice himself that another man should not
thirst, had in some extraordinary manner lost his passport. But
since most people look more or less alike in goggles and a
crash-helmet, the point escaped the notice of the aerodrome
authorities."</p>

<p>For perhaps ten seconds Berendosi stared at Standish with a look
of smouldering fury in his eyes. What had happened was clear. The
man upstairs was the real mechanic, for whom they had substituted
Denver at the last moment. And now Denver was gone beyond recall.
How they had fixed it mattered not: the one salient fact remained
that he had been completely outwitted. Moreover, in the presence of
the others it was impossible to show the furious rage that was
seething in him.</p>

<p>"How very interesting," he said at length.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would find it so," remarked Standish affably.
"Will you join us in a little lunch?"</p>

<p>"I thank you&mdash;no," answered the other. "You leave
to-night?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then I will say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Au revoir is more suitable, Signor Berendosi. I shall
return."</p>

<p>And once again the eyes of the two men met.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">CHAPTER VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THAT, up to date, luck had been with them all
along the line Ronald Standish was the first to admit. The
comparative similarity of build between Denver and the mechanic:
the fact that Denver held a pilot's ticket and so was fully capable
of taking over the job: above all, the sportsmanship of Laval the
French pilot in agreeing to the change, was a combination of
circumstances they could hardly hope to strike again. But it was a
good omen: the first hurdle, even if it was the least formidable,
had been cleared. Joe Denver was out of the country. Now they were
faced with the second. And it was after dinner was over that
Standish broached the subject to Tiny.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to take a pretty useful risk, old lad?" he
said quietly.</p>

<p>The restaurant car was empty save for the staff having a meal
behind the partition at the end.</p>

<p>"We've run one or two already," laughed the other, "so a few
more won't hurt."</p>

<p>"After you went to bed last night I got thinking," went on
Standish. "Thinking about this damned negative. Tiny&mdash;there is
only one way to get it, and that is to steal it."</p>

<p>Tiny raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Not too bally easy, old man, is it? I should imagine a man of
Blake's type takes fairly good precautions against burglary."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly he does. Hence the risk. But there is no other way.
He won't give it to us: we can't take it by force, so we've got to
get it by stealth if we get it at all."</p>

<p>"Seems sound enough reasoning," agreed Tiny. "How do you propose
to set about it?"</p>

<p>"I know his house, and I know the room in which he keeps his
safe. It is a ground-floor room looking out on to the garden, and
as far as I can recollect there are some trees fairly close to the
window. The first thing we've got to do is to get him out of the
way. And there, Tiny, Lady Mary comes in. She must contrive to keep
him clear of the house for at least two hours round about midnight.
Then we'll have a dip at it. I can manage the safe if I've got the
time. And if by any chance we are heard&mdash;he keeps a couple of
tame bruisers about the place, disguised as footmen&mdash;we'll
wade into 'em, or cut and run."</p>

<p>"Sounds easy: too easy. Still, it's worth chancing."</p>

<p>"The chief risk is if some zealous Hampstead policeman catches
us in the act. If we are just seen by some of his staff, however
good a description of us is circulated, I don't think we shall be
implicated. There are times," he added with a wink, "when Scotland
Yard can be very dense."</p>

<p>"And when do you suggest we should do it?"</p>

<p>"On the first possible occasion," said Standish. "Time is
becoming one of the most vital factors in this matter. And I
propose we should try to-morrow night. Always provided, that is,
that we can get hold of Lady Mary."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be much difficulty about that. I know she will be in
Town, and she'll cancel any engagement to help us. Incidentally,
what do we do about young Joe?"</p>

<p>Standish shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There's nothing much to be done. I'm damned sorry for the boy,
but other people have been in love before and got over it. We'll go
round to Laval's flat when we get to Paris, pick him up and take
him over to England. I can probably help to square matters over his
passport."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and leaned back in his seat.</p>

<p>"Gad! Tiny, it would be great if we could pull it off. Just
great, with..."</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, eyes narrowed, staring over Tiny's head.
Then he went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"all the odds against us."</p>

<p>"What's stung you, Ronald?"</p>

<p>"One of the biggest of those odds, who for the moment had
slipped my mind. Our friend Zavier is on the train, though I
certainly never noticed him get on at Dalzburg. And he's watching
us, Tiny!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"He was standing in the corridor of the next coach, and for a
moment our eyes met."</p>

<p>He called for the bill, and a few minutes later they returned to
their carriage. Sleeping berths had been impossible, and they had a
first-class compartment to themselves.</p>

<p>"Be careful, old man," he said abruptly, as Tiny prepared to
throw his coat, which he had left to mark his place, into the rack.
"Don't touch anything. Apparently nothing has been moved,
but..."</p>

<p>His eyes were searching every corner of the carriage, and after
awhile he drew on a pair of gloves.</p>

<p>"We may be several kinds of ass, Tiny, but I don't trust railway
trains when members of this fraternity are about. We've been in the
restaurant car for a good two hours, and this carriage has been
empty."</p>

<p>He ran his fingers gently over the upholstery, while the train
rocked and swayed through the darkness. And not until he had
explored every corner did he at length sit down.</p>

<p>"False alarm this time," he said. "But it alters things a little
for to-night. We mustn't both sleep at the same time: that's
obvious. We'll shut the door into the corridor, and we'll open the
window. But for the love of Pete if it's your watch don't forget to
shut it whenever we stop at a station."</p>

<p>But nothing happened throughout the night. Once, when they had
stopped at some comparatively small and ill-lit place, it had
seemed to Tiny that something had hit the window, but the blow was
so soft that he couldn't have sworn to it. And peering out he could
see nothing, so he dismissed it as imagination. Once also during
another period when he was on duty a peculiar-shaped shadow showed
for a moment in the corridor&mdash;a shadow so indefinite that it
might have been thrown by a sack. But it disappeared as abruptly as
it had come, and when he glanced out the corridor was empty. And so
without event they arrived in Paris.</p>

<p>"You deal with the kit, Tiny," said Standish, as the train ran
into the Gare de Lyon. "I'm sprinting like a hare for the barrier
to see if I can spot our friend."</p>

<p>But when Tiny joined him there, he shook his head a little
ruefully.</p>

<p>"I didn't," he said. "And I saw every soul who came off that
train."</p>

<p>"If your idea over the headquarters being in Switzerland is
right," remarked Tiny, "he may have got off there."</p>

<p>"Possibly," agreed Standish. "And yet I have a sort of hunch
that his goal is the same as ours&mdash;Felton Blake."</p>

<p>He gave Laval's address to the taxi-driver.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong, but I don't think they would trust a thing so
important as that negative to the post. Moreover, a man of Blake's
type trusts no one. He will want to see the colour of his money
before he parts. Still, it's guesswork. The only thing we know is
that Zavier has disappeared for the time as far as we are
concerned."</p>

<p>They found Laval having his breakfast and introduced
themselves.</p>

<p>"It was to me a great pleasure," he remarked when Standish began
to thank him for what he had done. "When the so charming Madame
Mackintosh tell me her scheme and I realize zat the honour of a
lady is at stake&mdash;<i>que voulez vous</i>? It was so easy. And
I arrange the affair of the passport here. I say my mechanic he is
ill, and zat this gentleman&mdash;a qualified pilot&mdash;he take
his place at ze last moment so as not to disappoint ze
passengers."</p>

<p>"Splendid, Monsieur Laval," cried Standish. "A thousand thanks.
And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He sleep late, I think, in zat room."</p>

<p>He crossed the passage, and knocked on the door of a room
opposite. And then, receiving no answer, he flung it open.</p>

<p>"He is not here. <i>Probablement</i> he is gone out. Ah! but
here is a note. Let us see what he say.</p>

<p class="letter">"DEAR MONSIEUR LAVAL,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"My warmest thanks for all that you have done. I
looked into your room but you were sleeping so I did not awaken
you. Tell Standish when you see him that I have gone to London.
I'll square the passport business somehow. And tell him I'll get
what we want. Again many thanks."</p>

<p>He laid the letter down on the table, and Standish re-read it,
frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"A nuisance&mdash;that," he said. "You don't know his address in
London, Tiny, I suppose? Or his club?"</p>

<p>"Not a notion. Why?"</p>

<p>"My dear old lad, Joe Denver is an excellent youngster. But the
last thing I want is to have him blundering round Felton Blake. And
that's what he evidently means to do. It's going to completely
queer our pitch. He'll do no good: and he'll put Blake on his
guard."</p>

<p>"I should think it is more than likely he will go and see Mary,"
said Tiny. "What about getting her on the 'phone?"</p>

<p>"That's a good idea. May we put through a London call, Monsieur
Laval?"</p>

<p>"But assuredly. It is in the hall."</p>

<p>"Tell her, Tiny, that if ever she sees Denver she must tell him
from us to do absolutely nothing until he sees us. Tell him to come
to the club at six to-night."</p>

<p>"And what about Felton Blake to-night?" said Tiny, hanging up
the receiver.</p>

<p>"Tell her what we want to do. But be guarded."</p>

<p>The call went through quickly, and in less than three minutes
Tiny heard Simmonds' voice from the other end.</p>

<p>"Speaking from Paris, Simmonds. Mr. Carteret. I want Lady Mary
urgently."</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is out of London, sir. Not returning until
lunch-time."</p>

<p>"Give him the message about Denver," said Standish, as Tiny
repeated it. "Not Felton Blake."</p>

<p>"Simmonds," went on Tiny, "you remember Mr. Denver. Tall, fair
gentleman with curly hair. You do. Good. If he comes to call on
Lady Mary to-day tell him that he is to do nothing until he sees
Mr. Standish. Got that? And tell him to be at my club at six."</p>

<p>He listened while the butler repeated the message, and then rang
off.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," said Standish. "We couldn't have passed a
message through him about Felton Blake. We must wire."</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled a telegraph form towards him.</p>

<p>"How's this?" he said a few moments later. "We want F.B. out of
his house to-night from eleven till one. Please arrange. Urgent and
vital. Tiny."</p>

<p>"That ought to do it," said Tiny. "And she'll pull it off if it
is humanly possible."</p>

<p>"My man can take it for you at once," said Laval. "The bureau is
just around the corner. And first he shall get you some hot water
for a shave."</p>

<p>"Excellent," cried Standish. "And then we must catch the ten
o'clock boat train."</p>

<p>"<i>Pour les pauvres, Messieurs.</i>"</p>

<p>Two nuns were standing in the passage, and the speaker, as if to
account for their unexpected appearance, added almost
apologetically&mdash;"<i>La porte était ouverte</i>."</p>

<p>The three men each handed over a note, and then, while one of
the nuns carefully entered the amounts in a little book, Laval led
the way to the bathroom. And for a moment the nuns were alone. So
that there was no one to see the sudden quick movement with which
the top telegraph form of the pad was detached, carefully folded,
and put away in a bag. And when Laval returned they were standing
meekly waiting for his signature in their book before leaving as
silently as they had arrived. Nor was there anyone to see that
instead of continuing their house to house visitation the two nuns
walked swiftly away to where a large car was waiting, and paused by
it just long enough to say "<i>Dix heures</i>"&mdash;and to place
the piece of paper in a hand extended through the window&mdash;the
hand of a man on whose shoulders sat a small monkey.</p>

<p>The car rolled off, and Boris Zavier studied the telegraph form.
He saw at once the imprint of the pencil, which had been made when
the wire had been written, but realizing the impossibility of
deciphering it in a moving car he re-folded it and placed it in his
pocket book. Then he lay back and began to think. For the events of
the last few days had shaken his nerve badly.</p>

<p>The first had been the Demeroff affair. That the Russian had
been coming to Lausanne with the express purpose of meeting
Standish he now knew, and though he had acted in time it had been a
very close shave. But the disquieting part of the thing was that it
proved that what he had said to Felton Blake was wrong. It was not
only the Bessonian affair that had brought Standish to Switzerland:
it was something much bigger. That the existence of his
organization was known to the authorities was obvious: activities
on such a scale as he had carried them out could only be inspired
by one controlling brain. And it struck him with a sort of cynical
humour that it would be amusing if this&mdash;one of the least of
his schemes&mdash;should prove to be the one that revealed to whom
the brain belonged.</p>

<p>It was the abduction of this boy Denver that worried him. Not
that he really cared in the slightest whether Berendosi succeeded
or failed: save for the money involved the whole thing bored him.
But what did matter was the fact that Standish and his friend must
have seen him at Gregoroff's place.</p>

<p>He cursed himself now for ever having attended such an absurd
farce, but at the time he did not know Standish was in Dalzburg.
Had he had an inkling of the fact nothing would have induced him to
go. For he was under no delusions with regard to the Englishman: he
was not a man to be trifled with. Once let him suspect and he would
pass his suspicions on. And it seemed to him more than likely that
he suspected already.</p>

<p>It had been a pure accident, that momentary glimpse in the
restaurant <i>wagon</i>, but the result of that accident had
alarmed him more than he cared to admit even to himself. Was it
merely coincidence that one or the other of them had been awake all
through the night? Was it merely coincidence that the door into the
corridor had been closed, and the windows shut whenever he had
alighted from the train? And finally, was it merely coincidence
that Standish should have been standing by the barrier watching the
passengers intently as they left the station? The fact that he had
passed within two feet of him in safety was beside the point: all
that mattered was whether these precautions had been due to that
accidental glimpse in the train. And being a man who never believed
in underrating the odds on the other side, he came quite definitely
to the conclusion that it would be better to assume it was not a
coincidence, and make his plans accordingly. Standish and his
friend Carteret suspected him: therefore, they must be dealt with,
and at once.</p>

<p>The car pulled up at the door of a luxurious flat, and Zavier
alighted. They were going by the ten o'clock train: he would go by
the one at midday. And that would leave him comfortable time to see
if the wire contained information of any importance. It proved
unexpectedly easy to decipher: the writer had evidently pressed
hard with his pencil. And when the complete message lay before him
on his desk, for awhile he stared thoughtfully out of the window.
Then a faint smile curled round his lips, and he rubbed his hands
gently together.</p>

<p>"Excellent," he murmured: "Excellent."</p>

<p>And with the smile still on his face he went into his
dressing-room.</p>

<p>At half-past five Tiny rang the bell of Lady Mary's house, and
the door was opened by Simmonds.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is not at home, sir," he said. "She left a note
for you."</p>

<p>"Did she get my wire?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"She got a wire, sir, when she returned at lunch-time."</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Denver been here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir: no sign of him. Will you come in, sir, and read the
note: you might like to write an answer."</p>

<p>Tiny went into the boudoir and as he glanced round the familiar
room he gave a short laugh. Only four days since he had last been
there: only four days since he had felt her lips on his for the
first time&mdash;but what a lot of water had flowed under the
bridge since then.</p>

<p>"A whisky and soda, sir?" suggested the butler.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Simmonds," he said, sitting down and opening the
note.</p>

<p class="letter">MY DEAR,&mdash;[it ran] I have done what you
asked in your wire. But what on earth is the idea? I gather from
your telephone message to Simmonds that Joe Denver must be safely
out of Dalzburg. Nada Mazarin wrote me from Paris to say he was
there, and that she had travelled with you. It's distracting that I
can't see you to-day, but I've got an engagement I simply cannot
break. I'm dying to hear all your news: come round and see me first
thing to-morrow. &mdash;MARY.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;There has been no sign of Joe
here.</p>

<p>He crossed to her desk as the butler came in with the drink.</p>

<p>"If I may say so, sir," he said with the familiarity of an old
servant, "her ladyship seems to have been very worried lately. Not
at all her usual self."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Simmonds. She has been. By the way, has a
gentleman called Blake been here at all?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice, sir," he said. "Might I ask, sir, if he
is&mdash;er&mdash;a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine!" cried Tiny. "Emphatically he is not."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised, sir," said Simmonds quietly. "Will you ring
if you require another drink, sir?"</p>

<p>So even the servants had noticed it, reflected Tiny savagely as
the door closed. And any lingering doubts he might have had about
the night's work ahead vanished. That negative had <i>got</i> to be
obtained.</p>

<p>He pulled a sheet of paper towards him.</p>

<p class="letter">MARY DEAR,&mdash;[he wrote]</p>

<p class="letter">Well done. I'll come round and see you to-morrow
and maybe&mdash;though I don't promise&mdash;it will see the end of
all our troubles. I've got lots to tell you. &mdash;TINY.</p>

<p>He sealed the envelope and finished his drink. Then he rang the
bell.</p>

<p>"Give this to Lady Mary, Simmonds, will you? And if by any
chance Mr. Denver does arrive, my telephone message to you still
holds. Send him round to my club without fail."</p>

<p>Ronald Standish was waiting for him in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>"Fortunately it is the more important of the two things that has
come off," was his comment when he heard Tiny's news. "And we can
only hope that young Denver postpones his visit till to-morrow. I
put through a call to the Folkestone passport people, and he'd
arrived all right by the one o'clock boat. And after they had
satisfied themselves he was British they let him go on. He was very
insistent apparently on getting to London as soon as
possible&mdash;strangely insistent was the phrase they used.
However, we can only hope for the best."</p>

<p>"Did you find out anything at the Yard?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"Not a thing. I described Zavier in detail, and clearly he is a
new one on them. Which proves just nothing at all. Then I went
along and saw Gillson, and gave him a résumé of our doings. In fact
I whispered to him of our expedition to-night. At first he tried to
dissuade me: said the risk was too great. But after awhile he
agreed that it was the only possible solution. Not that he can do
much if we're caught," he added with a short laugh. "We're
definitely putting ourselves outside the pale of the law. And, 'pon
my soul, Tiny, I don't know if it is fair to you. You are only a
volunteer, so to speak: it's not your palaver."</p>

<p>"Go to blazes, you ass," cried Tiny. "Unless you want a rough
house here and now."</p>

<p>"Right ho!" grinned the other. "I'm not denying you won't be
damned useful, but it's only fair to warn you that there is going
to be the devil of a risk."</p>

<p>"How are you going to open the safe if we do get in?" said
Tiny.</p>

<p>"One of my little secrets that you don't know," answered
Standish. "You shall after dinner."</p>

<p>"And since it will probably be our last," laughed Tiny, "we'd
better make it a good one."</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock when they left the club, and there was still
no sign of Joe Denver. During the meal they had both been unusually
silent: as the time drew nearer the bald fact that, if they were
caught, it would without a shadow of doubt mean a term of
imprisonment, began to obtrude itself with increasing clearness.
But neither of them had the slightest intention of drawing
back.</p>

<p>They drove to Standish's flat. There was at least an hour to put
through before they dared start, but there were several
preparations to be made. First he went to the safe in the corner of
the room, and from it he extracted a rolled-up green wallet of the
type used for motoring tools. Then he drew the blinds, before
opening it out on the table.</p>

<p>"This room is overlooked," he said with a grin. "And I'd hate
anyone to think that this represented my normal method of
livelihood."</p>

<p>Inside was a complete set of safe-opening tools. Braces,
bits&mdash;all the paraphernalia of the professional cracksman lay
gleaming in the electric light.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! old man," cried Tiny. "Where did you get that
lot?"</p>

<p>"I got them in the States from a professional user of them,"
laughed the other, "as a small token of gratitude for something I
did for him. According to him they weren't quite up to his form,
and he was getting some others. Moreover, he showed me how to use
'em."</p>

<p>He rolled up the wallet again and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;two masks." He rummaged in a drawer. "Here are two
that will do."</p>

<p>"Are we taking any weapons?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"I think not, old lad. Certainly not guns. Burglary is one
thing: shooting is another. No: we'll stick to the perfectly
efficient fist, if we're caught in the act, and then run like
stags. For the trouble is that we daren't go in my car. We'd have
to leave it some distance from the house, and a car untended for
two hours or so would have the police on it at once. We'll just
take a taxi to somewhere near the house and then walk."</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when they decided they could start, and a
quarter of an hour later they dismissed their machine at Swiss
Cottage. If Blake was meeting Lady Mary at eleven, he would have
left his house already and the coast would be clear.</p>

<p>They walked along Eton Avenue, comparatively dimly lit after the
glare of Finchley Road behind them. And after about a quarter of a
mile Standish turned left-handed up an even quieter road. They were
in the centre of one of the wealthy residential quarters of
Hampstead, and the houses on each side of them proclaimed the fact.
Solid, comfortable and above all eminently respectable, they seemed
to personify their solid, comfortable and eminently respectable
owners.</p>

<p>"There is the spot we want," said Standish. "Number 12."</p>

<p>They paused opposite it on the other side of the road. It was in
darkness save for a light from one of the top windows. To the right
of it as they looked lay the garage, and over the top of it they
could see some trees.</p>

<p>"Up and at it, Tiny," chuckled Standish. "Take your last look at
London as a free man. My God! what's that?"</p>

<p>For suddenly there had come a ghastly strident shriek of agony,
and it had seemed to proceed from the house they were watching. A
window was flung up behind them, and a man peered out. With a quick
pressure on his arm Standish indicated to Tiny that they should
walk on. But the scream was not repeated, and after strolling a few
yards, they retraced their steps.</p>

<p>"Was that from Blake's house?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Sounded like it. We must wait now for a bit: it's probably
alarmed the neighbourhood. Hullo! what's this?"</p>

<p>Once again he gripped Tiny's arm and the pair stood motionless
under a tree. A man had come out of the gate of Number 12, and
keeping in the shadow of the trees was walking rapidly towards Eton
Avenue. It was quite impossible to recognize him: a hat pulled well
down over his forehead obscured his features even if they had been
visible at the distance. But not till the sound of his steps had
died away did they move.</p>

<p>"Our friend would seem to have other visitors to-night," said
Standish thoughtfully. "Things grow interesting."</p>

<p>"Well, the alarm doesn't seem to have spread," remarked Tiny.
"And the place is deserted. What about it?"</p>

<p>They crossed the road some fifty yards from Blake's house, and
strolled gently towards it. The man who had looked out had shut the
window again: the moment was propitious. And with one quick glance
round Standish turned in at the gate, and moved swiftly towards the
garage.</p>

<p>There was a space of nearly a yard between the garage and the
wall that divided Number 12 from the next house, and in a second
they were both standing in it. It afforded perfect cover, and gave
them a direct approach to the garden without the slightest chance
of being seen. A certain amount of old rubbish had collected in it,
and Standish picked his way carefully: it was not the time to play
football with old oil cans. But nothing untoward occurred, and they
reached the shadow of the trees without mishap.</p>

<p>To their right lay the garden: in front of them and a little to
the left was the back of the house. It, too, was in complete
darkness, and after a while they began to creep cautiously towards
it.</p>

<p>"It's the room with the big French windows," whispered Standish.
"The second one we come to."</p>

<p>They were close to it when he paused suddenly, and Tiny,
glancing at him, could just see that he was frowning.</p>

<p>"Why are the windows open, Tiny?" he breathed, "when there is no
light in the room? There is something damned funny about this
show."</p>

<p>They could see the curtains moving gently in the slight breeze.
No sound came from inside: the place seemed ominously quiet. And
then they both shrank against the wall: a telephone bell was
ringing in the room.</p>

<p>"Back to the trees," said Standish urgently. "Someone will
probably answer it."</p>

<p>But no one did, and after a few more abortive attempts the
operator gave it up. Silence settled once again save for the faint
rustle of the leaves above their heads. They allowed five minutes:
then for the second time they crept towards the window. There was
no good delaying: every moment of time was valuable.</p>

<p>"I'll get on to the safe at once, Tiny," whispered Standish.
"You lock the door, and then stand by the window. Great Scott! look
there."</p>

<p>He had parted the curtains, and was crouching down staring at
the floor. The wood was of a light colour inside the window, and
stretching out from the edge of the carpet a dark stain was
visible. And even as they looked at it, it altered its shape.</p>

<p>With a sudden exclamation he switched on a small electric torch:
then his eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered. "It's blood. For Heaven's sake be careful
where you tread."</p>

<p>Holding his torch in front of him he stepped into the room. And
there they stood, motionless: the failure to answer the telephone
was explained.</p>

<p>Lying on his back, with legs and arms sprawling, was Felton
Blake, and driven up to the hilt in his heart was a dagger. The
blood had welled out, soaking into the carpet and finally reaching
the woodwork, though now it had ceased to flow.</p>

<p>"That scream we heard," muttered Tiny. "It must have been
his."</p>

<p>But Standish shook his head.</p>

<p>"No man killed like that would scream. It was
instantaneous."</p>

<p>He bent and felt one of the dead man's hands. "He's been dead
some time. Hold those curtains together: I'm going to get some
light on the scene."</p>

<p>He crept noiselessly away and in a moment there came the click
of a switch. And once again they stood motionless, too stunned to
speak. For the door of the big safe was open, and the contents were
flung in wild confusion all over the carpet. But it was not empty.
Lying half inside it, his head wedged in a corner, with teeth bared
and only the whites of his eyes showing, was Joe Denver. No need to
ask the cause of his death: both of them recognized it only too
well. Somewhere on him they would find the death scratch: he had
been murdered even as Demeroff and the others had been murdered.
And it was his dying scream they had heard from the other side of
the road.</p>

<p>"So that's what he meant when he said he'd get the negative
somehow," said Standish gravely. "Poor young devil! And I don't
know that I blame him."</p>

<p>"You think he killed Blake?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>Standish pointed to the key which was in the safe door.</p>

<p>"I think that he killed Blake, and then took the key from him.
Blake has been dead for more than an hour: Denver for less than a
quarter."</p>

<p>"And the man we saw leaving killed Joe?"</p>

<p>"Possibly, though we have no proof. Possibly there is some
infernal device in the safe itself." He was drawing on his gloves
as he spoke. "But now we've got to get a move on. We don't want to
be discovered here if we can avoid it. The first point is&mdash;did
he find the negative?"</p>

<p>Gently they pulled the twisted body on to the carpet, and then
swiftly and methodically Standish went through his pockets.</p>

<p>"No sign of it," he muttered.</p>

<p>"If he'd found it he would have destroyed it," said Tiny, but
though they searched every corner of the room, the paper basket and
the fire-place, they could find no traces of it anywhere.</p>

<p>"Useless, Tiny. He'd surely have destroyed it here by the safe,
if he destroyed it at all."</p>

<p>He was peering at the carpet with his torch held close.</p>

<p>"Nothing: nothing at all. And even a film leaves some residue if
it is burnt."</p>

<p>At length he straightened up.</p>

<p>"He didn't get it, Tiny, and that means it isn't here."</p>

<p>"Then what do we do now?"</p>

<p>"We collect these papers," said Standish quietly. "Every one of
them probably means some poor devil's happiness. Our burglary shall
have some result, anyway."</p>

<p>He crammed them into his pockets till they bulged, while Tiny
stood by him. Some result perhaps&mdash;but it was only a side
issue. As far as they were concerned it had all been wasted; the
negative was still in existence. And a damned good man had been
killed. Of Felton Blake he gave no thought: men such as he deserved
to die. But in his imagination he could see the youngster going
feverishly through the safe: he could feel the despair that must
have gripped him as he drew blank. And then&mdash;the end&mdash;the
ghastly agonizing end.</p>

<p>"Tiny."</p>

<p>He glanced up at the sharp whisper: Standish was by the window
looking at the floor.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You didn't tread in the blood here, did you?"</p>

<p>"No." He crossed the room and joined the other.</p>

<p>"Look there," said Standish.</p>

<p>In the crimson patch, clear and distinct was a footmark.</p>

<p>"Someone has been watching us," he continued gravely. "The
waters grow deeper."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">CHAPTER IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"SO it's hopeless, Tiny: they've beaten us."</p>

<p>"I must say, Mary dear, that at the moment it looks rather like
it."</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock the following morning, and the two of them
were in her boudoir. He had told her the whole story of what had
happened since they last met, and she in her turn had filled in one
or two blanks.</p>

<p>"You see, Tiny," she said, "I knew the man was a sweep, and I
can't pretend that in one way the news of his death isn't a
profound relief. At the same time I did think he was genuinely
trying to get it."</p>

<p>"But how dared such an excrescence fall in love with you?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she said with a short laugh, "I don't know about
love. But he was received in a lot of places, and I think he
thought that marrying a Duke's daughter would enable him to be
received in more."</p>

<p>"Would you really have married him," he said curiously, "if he
had produced the negative?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows," she answered. "Anyway, the point does not arise.
It's the thought of Joe that upsets me so much. They must have been
both lying there when I telephoned."</p>

<p>"It was you, was it? We were just outside the window, and it
startled us some."</p>

<p>"My dear, I was getting wild with anxiety. I'd arranged for him
to meet me here at ten-thirty. And when eleven came with no sign of
him I rang up. Tiny&mdash;what <i>are</i> we to do?"</p>

<p>She rose restlessly and stood by the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Dunno, Mary dear," he said. "I'm absolutely beat."</p>

<p>"Can't Mr. Standish suggest something?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him to-day," said Tiny. "He was going round to
see Gillson, and I told him I was coming here."</p>

<p>"I wish she had seen him once. Olga and Joe," she added with a
faint smile as she saw the puzzled look on his face. "I'm jumping a
bit this morning: nerves all on edge."</p>

<p>"It was impossible, my dear," he answered gravely. "Every other
person you meet there is a spy."</p>

<p>"And to think he did it for nothing: that is the wicked part of
it. Oh! Tiny, we can't let it be in vain: we <i>can't</i>."</p>

<p>"The Lord knows, dear, that those are my sentiments too. And
Ronald's as well. But it's the devil and all of a proposition."</p>

<p>"And it will be the end of all things if that photo is
published?"</p>

<p>It was a question, but he could see she was clutching at a straw
of hope.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "as you know, my acquaintance with Bessonian
politics is microscopic. All I can tell you is that both Ronald and
that fellow Andy Mackintosh, who I was telling you about, view the
case as hopeless if Berendosi gets hold of that negative. And now
that we've drawn blank in Blake's safe it might be anywhere."</p>

<p>Simmonds opened the door, and entered with a card on a
salver.</p>

<p>"Tiny," cried the girl, "it's your pal&mdash;Mr. Standish. Show
him in at once, Simmonds. Do you think he's thought of something
new?"</p>

<p>"We'll soon hear if he has."</p>

<p>He turned as Ronald Standish came in, and it seemed to him as if
there was a certain suppressed excitement in the other's face.</p>

<p>"Something fresh," he cried. "Oh! by the way, you two haven't
met, have you? My fellow-criminal, Mary ..."</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish," she said eagerly, "you look as if there was a
new development."</p>

<p>"I won't go so far as to say that, Lady Mary," answered
Standish, "but we have just obtained a piece of information which
<i>might</i> lead us somewhere. May I smoke?"</p>

<p>"Please do."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, while the others waited breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Tiny, of course, will have told you everything that happened
last night. How young Denver went to interview Blake in order to
get the negative, and when Blake refused to part he killed him. He
took the keys, opened the safe, and later was murdered himself. So
much is clear. From now it becomes a question of surmise, with only
one fact standing out as certain. And that fact is that the man we
saw leaving Blake's house shortly after we heard Denver's scream
was either the murderer or knew that he had been murdered."</p>

<p>"Now that action on his part is understandable: he would
naturally clear off for fear the scream should attract people to
the place. But what is not so understandable is why they should
have murdered Denver at all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Joe had found it," said Tiny, "and he murdered him to
get it back."</p>

<p>"The first thought that occurred to me, but there is one
insuperable difficulty. We know that poison and its method of
working. Take Demeroff: take other cases. It requires at least a
quarter of an hour to act. During that quarter of an hour if Denver
had found the negative, he might and probably would have destroyed
it. Would the murderer, then, dare to have risked it? The film was
far more important to him than killing Denver. In fact, the last
thing he wanted to do was to kill Denver: he is much more value to
the other side alive than dead."</p>

<p>"Anyway he <i>did</i> kill him, Ronald&mdash;so there is no more
to be said."</p>

<p>"But did he <i>mean</i> to, Tiny?"</p>

<p>"You mean it was an accident."</p>

<p>"Yes and no. He meant to kill someone&mdash;but not Denver. He
killed the wrong man."</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens! old man, it's impossible. And anyway, who
did he mean to kill?"</p>

<p>"Me," said Standish quietly. "And possibly you."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say he didn't know he was killing
Denver?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean to say. I admit it sounds wild&mdash;almost
fantastic. Nevertheless, can you give me any reason whatsoever why
the other side should commit such a suicidal act from their point
of view as to kill a man who was vitally important to them?"</p>

<p>"I can't. But neither can I give you any reason why they should
have imagined we were going to be there at all."</p>

<p>"Let's go on with our surmise, and put ourselves in the other
bloke's place&mdash;in Zavier's place. Zavier knows that we are
fully aware of the existence of that negative: he knows we connect
Blake with it: he knows we are in London. Surely his first
assumption would be that we would seek an interview with Blake and
do our best to get it. He may not have thought we would go as far
as burglary, but he must assume on our trying to obtain it. He
therefore lays his plans accordingly. He instructs a
subordinate&mdash;or possibly that was Zavier himself last
night&mdash;and proceeds, in some mysterious way, which I frankly
admit I cannot explain, to lie up for us. First he removes the
negative to avoid any possibility of danger to it: then probably in
conjunction with Blake he sets the scene. He obviously cannot be
present&mdash;that would give the whole thing away. And if the plan
comes off Blake is safe, because my death would appear as all the
other deaths have appeared to be, due to heart trouble.</p>

<p>"Then comes the one thing he had not anticipated. Instead of us
appearing, Joe Denver turns up.. He, as I say, was not there: he
was probably hanging about somewhere to see what happened. Nothing
at all might have occurred, in which case he would try again next
night. Suddenly he hears the scream, and goes in. To his horror he
finds Blake murdered and the wrong man dead in the safe. He waits
only to remove whatever there was in that room to cause death to
Denver, and bolts."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Standish," cried the girl, "I don't quite see how all
this helps. Even if you are right, this man Zavier has the
negative. And that's all that matters."</p>

<p>"Sorry to be so long: I'm coming to that now. As you say, that
is all that counts, but I wanted to start from the beginning. As I
said, he then bolts: we know that&mdash;we saw him. Which brings us
to the second very peculiar incident, as peculiar in its own way as
the killing of Denver. What brought him back again? As Tiny has
probably told you, Lady Mary, we saw his footprints in the blood by
the window. Why did he return?"</p>

<p>"How do we know it was the same man?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't have been a policeman or any ordinary outsider:
in either of those cases the alarm would have been raised at once.
Therefore if it wasn't the same man it was at any rate someone who
knew what had happened and so must have been one of the gang. And
since the film was safe as far as they were concerned, what object
was served by his coming back? This morning I got a possible
answer.</p>

<p>"You remember, Tiny, that I took away all the papers from
Blake's safe. This morning I went through them with Gillson. Ye
gods! the half of that man's vileness has not been thought of.
There were letters in his possession belonging to people whose
names are household words, and who he has been bleeding to death.
Needless to say we burned the lot, with the exception of one most
interesting one."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a legal-looking document.</p>

<p>"This is the lease of 11 Gregory Street. The landlord is, or
rather was, Felton Blake: the tenants are three in number. A
bookmaker has an office on the first floor: there is a branch of
some wholesale hardware store on the second. But the basement is
let to an organization with a somewhat strange name&mdash;the
Universal Benevolent Society.</p>

<p>"At first sight admittedly there is nothing very peculiar about
it, but when we studied it a little closer an interesting point
emerged. The first two 'lets' are drawn up in the orthodox legal
fashion with rent and all the usual conditions stated, but for the
Universal Benevolent Society the document is simply worthless. From
a business point of view it has no value whatever. In fact it is
not a lease.</p>

<p>"Knowing Felton Blake's characteristics, this seemed strange. He
was not the type of man to let the Universal or any other
benevolent society have an office without paying for it. And when
Gillson's secretary, who was in the room at the time, happened to
remember where Gregory Street was, the matter began to take shape.
To cut it short, this house abuts on to the back of the Fifty-Nine
Club, and the basement therefore is on the level of the dance
floor.</p>

<p>"Now you know, Tiny, that for some time past the police have had
that club under close supervision. And there have been two or three
strange incidents there. The other night, for instance, a man who
was well known as a trafficker in drugs came to the club and was
spotted by one of our men there, who tipped the wink to his
companion upstairs. There was no question of arresting the
man&mdash;he was only one of the smaller fry: but as a matter of
interest they kept an eye on him. Our fellow downstairs was acting
as a waiter, and so was not in the room the whole time. And it so
happened that he did not actually see this man leave his table. But
at some period during the evening he did so, and he did not return.
Moreover, he did not go out by the front entrance."</p>

<p>"Your point is, then," said Tiny, "that there is some form of
communication between the club and this house in Gregory
Street?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And my further point is that it was to obtain this
document, which he had forgotten in the excitement of the moment,
that our friend of last night returned. He knew the police would
spot it as soon as they came to go through it carefully: and he
knew that in a few hours the police must discover the murders and
take possession of all the papers. And so he came back to get it,
only to find us in occupation."</p>

<p>"But where is all this leading us to, Mr. Standish?" cried the
girl, a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"It does seem a bit beside the mark, I agree, Lady Mary," said
Standish with a smile, "but I've very nearly finished. You see it
has put the gentleman in an awkward quandary. Assuming&mdash;and
one must make assumptions in a case like this&mdash;assuming he has
the negative in his possession, his first instinct, realizing we
are on the trail, would be to take it direct to Berendosi and
pocket the money. But he now knows that we are in possession of
this information about 11 Gregory Street. He knows that the
Universal Benevolent Society has served its turn and must close
down. Dare he therefore leave the country until he has closed it
down? Which is not likely to be a matter that can be done in two or
three hours.</p>

<p>"And so, if you want some fun, go to the Fifty-Nine to-night.
Anyway, Tiny, you must go even if Lady Mary doesn't, and you must
get a table from which you can command a view of the staircase. At
one o'clock the club will be raided, though I promise you that your
names shall not appear. At a little before one there will be a
certain activity round the office of the Universal Benevolent
Society, which I hope may bolt the badger. And even though a raid
is on in the club he can only bolt that way. If, as I hope and
believe, our badger is Zavier himself, you will recognize him. Then
tip the wink to the Inspector in charge of the raid: we'll do the
rest."</p>

<p>"But is he likely to have the negative on him, Mr. Standish?"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"More than likely. What safer place could there be from his
point of view? There is nothing criminal about it. But if by chance
we pull it off, I fear that an accident will happen to it."</p>

<p>"By Jove! it sounds possible, old man," cried Tiny. "I'll be
there."</p>

<p>"So will I," said the girl excitedly.</p>

<p>"Easy does it," warned Standish. "Don't for Heaven's sake let's
build on it. It may come off: there's a bare chance of it's coming
off&mdash;but that's all."</p>

<p>"Anyway there is a chance," she said. "Which is more than we
thought a little while ago."</p>

<p>"What is your part in the show, Ronald?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"I shall be with the Number 11 party. It is essential that you
should mark one exit while I take the other, because we are the
only people who know him."</p>

<p>"Always provided it is Zavier."</p>

<p>"Always provided it is Zavier," agreed Standish, getting up to
go. "And somehow, Tiny, I believe we shall find that it is. This
whole business is too big for a subordinate. Well&mdash;I must be
off. And if I don't see you again, be at the Fifty-Nine from
midnight onwards. And&mdash;<i>don't</i>build on it."</p>

<p>But it was well-nigh impossible not to. All through luncheon
they fluctuated between hope and despair, and the afternoon seemed
to drag on leaden wheels. There was an account of the previous
night's tragedy in all the midday papers, but somehow naturally it
told them nothing they did not know already. The police, as usual,
were in possession of a valuable clue, and further developments
were expected at any moment.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Standish rang up.</p>

<p>"Developments, Tiny," he said, "and hopeful ones. There is
considerable activity round Number 11. Two car loads of suit-cases
and packages of various sorts have been removed, and have been
followed to their new destination, where we can lay our hands on
them at any time."</p>

<p>"Can't you raid the place now?" asked Tiny.</p>

<p>"Got no warrant. And no magistrate would issue one on our
present knowledge. Cheer up, old lad: I'm feeling more
confident."</p>

<p>At last midnight came. Their table was almost next to the foot
of the stairs leading to the street, which they had insisted on
having much to the amazement of the head waiter, who pointed out
that it was the worst in the room. The cabaret show was just
starting, and having ordered kippers and a bottle they tried to
watch it, without, however, much success. Apart from the fact that
they had both seen it before, they were far too keyed up to pay any
attention.</p>

<p>"What happens in a raid, Tiny?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"My dear, it's a perfectly harmless proceeding. Some large men
will appear on the stairs, and other large men will walk gracefully
round the room taking our names and addresses. Hullo! do you see
that waiter over there&mdash;the one attending to the woman with
magenta hair? He is police&mdash;one Dexter by name."</p>

<p>And at that moment the man turned and caught Tiny's eye. It was
the flicker of an eyelid that he gave, rather than a wink, before
he resumed his job, but it was vaguely comforting. It seemed to
establish a sort of liaison with the imperturbable Gillson and the
powers that be generally.</p>

<p>"Is it my imagination, Mary," said Tiny after awhile, "or is
there an air of tension about the place? Giuseppi has been in twice
talking to the head waiter, and it strikes me the staff seems
uneasy."</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Quarter of an hour to go. Gad! I wish I knew what was happening
next door."</p>

<p>The show was over: dancing had started again. And now there was
no mistaking it: something was in the air. Giuseppi had come in
again and was gesticulating in a corner with his second in command,
while the waiters in their vicinity listened eagerly. Then abruptly
the band stopped.</p>

<p>The head waiter issued rapid orders to his underlings: Giuseppi
stepped into the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemens," he called out, "ze police..."</p>

<p>"Quite so," came a deep genial voice from the stairs, "the
police."</p>

<p>A dead silence settled on the room.</p>

<p>"I must ask you, ladies and gentlemen, please to keep your
seats. You will not be put to any inconvenience. I shall require
your names and addresses, and I may say that I shall view any Mr.
Smith of Birmingham with grave suspicion. In the last raid I
undertook there were six."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh as he came down the stairs, leaving
two men in uniform standing at the top. And the first table he
stopped at was Tiny's.</p>

<p>"I need hardly ask your name, sir," he said with a twinkle in
his eye. "I've watched you too often at Twickenham. If you see your
man, wait till I am talking to him, and then come up to me and ask
if you can go."</p>

<p>The whole sentence was spoken without the faintest change of
inflection, while the Inspector was apparently writing in his
book.</p>

<p>"I get you," said Tiny, in the same tone of voice, and the
Inspector passed on.</p>

<p>A general buzz of conversation had broken out: the Inspector's
jovial manner had put everyone in a good temper except Giuseppi
whose agitation was obvious. In fact, it seemed to Tiny that it was
out of all proportion to what might have been expected from the
anticipation of a hundred-pound fine. He watched him closely, and
soon he noticed that he was shooting continual little bird-like
glances at a far corner of the room. There was a small alcove there
containing a table where he had sometimes sat himself, and beyond
it was a door with frosted glass marked "Private." He had always
assumed it was Giuseppi's office, but now he began to wonder. He
made a quick calculation: Gregory Street lay beyond that side of
the room. And at that moment he noticed a man with a small pointed
beard sitting at a table by himself not far from the alcove.</p>

<p>To Zavier he bore not the slightest resemblance as far as he
could see. This man's hair was plentiful while Zavier was bald:
moreover Zavier was clean shaven. But those were trifles: wigs were
easy to obtain. What did count was, that whether this man was
Zavier or not, he had not been at that table ten minutes
previously. Of that fact Tiny was certain. He had happened to
notice on glancing round the room earlier that the table next to
the one this man now occupied contained a well-known actress in the
party, and it had momentarily attracted his attention in that
direction. And he was convinced he would have noticed this bearded
man if he had been there.</p>

<p>It was the wildest guesswork: he realized that. The man might
have been away for a moment, or dancing. But no: he couldn't have
been dancing. The cabaret show had been on most of the time. And
suddenly he made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;I'm going to chance it," he said. "It may be the
most ungodly bloomer, but I can't help that."</p>

<p>"Do you think you've spotted him, Tiny?" she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's that bloke over there with a beaver, sitting next the
table where Paula Rayne is. I swear he has only just sat down
there."</p>

<p>"Go on, Tiny: it's worth it every time."</p>

<p>He waited until the Inspector was about to reach him: then he
rose and crossed the room.</p>

<p>"I say, Inspector," he remarked, "is there any jolly old reason
why one shouldn't push off?"</p>

<p>He glanced at the man, who was staring at him with unwinking
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain you want to go, sir?" said the Inspector
quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm never quite certain about anything, dear old lad," laughed
Tiny, and at that moment it happened. He had one glimpse of a face
distorted with fury glaring into his: then both he and the
Inspector were on their backs on the floor with the table on top of
them and the cloth round their heads.</p>

<p>They scrambled up swearing: the man had disappeared. And after a
pause of stupefied silence, everyone near them began talking at
once.</p>

<p>"Up there."</p>

<p>"That's where he went."</p>

<p>"Towards the private room."</p>

<p>One of the constables had come running down the stairs, but it
was Tiny who headed the pursuit, closely followed by the Inspector.
They darted along the passage to find a frightened waiter cowering
up against the wall.</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" shouted Tiny.</p>

<p>"In there, sir," stammered the man.</p>

<p>And even as he threw himself against the door he noticed it was
Number 7.</p>

<p>"Locked," cried Tiny. "All together, boys."</p>

<p>Which proved an admirable prophecy. For at the precise moment
they charged the door, it was opened from the inside. And once
again the Inspector and Tiny found themselves on the floor, with
the addition this time of a large constable. They picked themselves
up: confronting them was a vacuous-looking youth with an eye-glass,
while at the table there sat an extremely frightened girl.</p>

<p>"I say," he bleated, "has the whole place gone bug house? First
of all there comes a man with a beard, who locks the door and
vanishes through the wall..."</p>

<p>"What part of the wall?" snapped the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Just there: by the fire-place..."</p>

<p>In a couple of strides the Inspector reached the spot and hit it
with his fist.</p>

<p>"Hollow," he cried. "Once again, sir: all together."</p>

<p>They felt it crack under their weight, and with the third charge
it gave way, revealing a narrow brick passage.</p>

<p>"Careful, sir," said the Inspector warningly, as Tiny started
along it. "He's probably a dangerous customer."</p>

<p>He turned to the constable. "Get everyone out of the room,
except the two who were in there first. Now, sir."</p>

<p>Cautiously they moved forward. The room behind gave them some
light to begin with, but after awhile the passage bent left-handed,
and almost at once they felt cooler air on their faces. With a
grunt the Inspector hurried forward: in front of them was a chink
of light.</p>

<p>"The damned fellow has done us, sir," he said. "There was a
third bolt-hole."</p>

<p>They had emerged into a deserted mews. An old lean-to shed
concealed the entrance to the passage: a solitary gas lamp supplied
the illumination. Not a soul was in sight, though there was a
certain amount of traffic in the street at the end. The spot where
they stood formed a cul-de-sac, and once again the Inspector swore
under his breath.</p>

<p>"Staffordale Street," he said. "And we've lost him right enough.
Haven't got anyone posted there at all. How did you spot him, sir?"
he added curiously.</p>

<p>"I took a chance," said Tiny. "I knew he had not been long at
that table: in fact he suddenly arrived."</p>

<p>"Well, he was our bird evidently. Come on, sir: we'd best be
getting back. Useless going along the mews: he's got clean
away."</p>

<p>They retraced their steps along the passage. The vacuous youth
was still declaiming loudly against life in general, and even Tiny,
sore though he was at being baulked, couldn't help smiling. To
bring a girl out to supper in a private room and then have dozens
of people playing leap-frog through it is a trifle disconcerting,
to say the least of it.</p>

<p>"Got away, Mary," he said gloomily as he joined her. "There was
a secret door in Number 7&mdash;the room where you fed with Blake.
And he did a bolt through it. Of course that beard was false, and
the wig too."</p>

<p>"You'd better wait, sir," said the Inspector, coming up to their
table. "I'll soon have finished with the rest of these people, and
then we'll clear the place. Mr. Standish is here: I've told him
about it."</p>

<p>And at that moment they saw him threading his way through the
tables towards them.</p>

<p>"Pretty sickening," he said. "Especially after you'd spotted
him, Tiny. Evidently Zavier right enough: the Inspector mentioned
those light-blue eyes of his."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now, Mr. Standish?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"Keep a watch at every port for a man with eyes like that," he
answered. "Nothing else to be done."</p>

<p>"How went things with you, Ronald," said Tiny. "Did you find out
anything?"</p>

<p>"Enough to jug the whole lot," said the other grimly. "We've got
one of them under lock and key now. The Universal Benevolent
Society still retained on its premises enough drugs to dope an
army. The rest they had got rid of this afternoon, as I told you,
by taxi. In addition we found the remains of what was obviously a
forger's plant in a cellar off the basement. Damn it!" he
continued, thumping his fist on the table, "if we'd been one minute
earlier we'd have caught him. Or if the police hadn't had to appear
to act legally we'd have done it. You see you can't force an
entrance to a place without either a warrant or some very good
excuse. So as we couldn't get the first, we had to fall back on the
second. A little straw was lit and thrown down outside the
basement, and that gave us the pretext of fire. It also gave the
alarm inside.</p>

<p>"We forced a window, and rushed below. A pale-faced youth was
sitting at a table, who rose and demanded what we wanted. We told
him we thought the house was on fire, and at that moment I noticed
the butt of one of those tiny cigarettes Zavier always smokes.
Moreover, it was still smouldering, while the youth had a Gold
Flake in his mouth.</p>

<p>"'Where is the man who was here with you?' I cried.</p>

<p>"He denied it, and I pointed to the butt end in front of him. He
turned a bit green about the gills when he saw it, but he still
continued to stick to his story. In fact he began to bluster, and
demanded by what right we dared to intrude.</p>

<p>"'Look at this, sir,' sang out the sergeant to me, and our
friend turned greener still.</p>

<p>"'This' was a mass of charred paper in the grate, in which quite
a number of fragments were unburned. And anyone could tell at a
glance that it was the paper used for counterfeiting bank
notes.</p>

<p>"'How came this paper in your possession?' I said, but he merely
shook his head. He was only a paid clerk, and knew nothing about
it.</p>

<p>"All this time I was wandering round the room trying to find the
second exit. That Zavier had been there just before we came, I
knew. He couldn't have got out by the stairs, therefore there must
be another door. And after a few moments I found it. There was a
bookshelf in one corner, and on closer inspection it proved to be a
blind. It swung back, revealing a cellar beyond leading out of a
passage. The music from here was plainly audible, and while the
police searched the cellar I tried to find the communicating door.
But it was concealed too well."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it is behind that door marked 'Private,'" said
Tiny.</p>

<p>"Probably. Anyway we'll get it from this side, once they've
emptied the place. They've had months, you see, to make a good job
of things."</p>

<p>"What chance is there of catching Zavier, now?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"Not so good as half an hour ago, I'm afraid," he admitted. "No
good blinding ourselves to the facts. From one point of view this
raid has been a brilliant success: but from the point of view that
concerns us most it's been a failure. He's slipped through our
fingers once again. And the only ray of comfort that I see is that
he is bound to try and leave the country sooner or later with the
negative on him. He would never dare risk sending it by post to
Berendosi. He'll want to see the colour of his money before he
hands it over."</p>

<p>The Inspector approached the table.</p>

<p>"I've interviewed Giuseppi, sir," he said, "and he either can't
or won't say a thing. He is terrified out of his life. Swears he
knows nothing about the house next door."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," said Tiny. "You bring him down here, Inspector,
and ask him what's behind that glass door over there."</p>

<p>"I'm going to explore that now," said the other.</p>

<p>He signalled to one of his men to fetch the Italian.</p>

<p>"Now, Giuseppi," he remarked curtly, as the proprietor appeared,
"we're going to have a little further exploration. Where does that
door lead to?"</p>

<p>"To my private room," wailed the other. "I give you my word,
sare, ze word of an Italian, zat zere is noddings zere."</p>

<p>"I'd sooner have the key, thank you," laughed the Inspector.
"Come on, Giuseppi," he added sternly. "Get a move on. If you don't
open that door at once I'll break it down."</p>

<p>Protesting volubly the little man produced a bunch of keys and
led the way across the room, with the others behind him. And after
much fumbling he at length got the door open. It was a small
plainly furnished room. Against one wall stood an ordinary roll-top
desk: for the rest a couple of easy chairs completed the contents,
except for some overcoats which hung on pegs from the wall. And
Tiny, happening to glance at Giuseppi, saw that it was at these he
was staring.</p>

<p>"What the devil is this?" said Standish suddenly.</p>

<p>He was bending over the paper basket, from which he proceeded to
pull out a number of pieces of torn brown cloth. Some of them had
been ruthlessly slashed with scissors: others had been ripped by
hand. And in a corner of the room was another heap of similar
fragments.</p>

<p>They all stared at the Italian, who shrugged his shoulders
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Signors," he said, "it is an old dressing-gown of mine. There
are times, you understand, when I take off ze coat and ze
waistcoat..."</p>

<p>"Why have you ripped it to pieces?" said Standish curtly.</p>

<p>"It is old, sare. Besides zis afternoon suddenly he annoy me. I
like not his colour. I snatch him off: I tear him up."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty bad liar, my lad," said Standish. "Though I
frankly admit I can't quite spot where it comes into the general
scheme. However, that may come later. Where is the communicating
door, Giuseppi?"</p>

<p>"Zere is no such sing, sare," he protested. "Zat is all brick
wall behind."</p>

<p>"Get out of the light," snapped the Inspector, and pushing the
Italian on one side he proceeded to make a minute inspection. And
at last he gave a cry of triumph.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Mr. Standish. You can see the crack in the
woodwork. Now, see here, Giuseppi&mdash;we've wasted enough time
already. Get that open, and do it at once. Very well, if you
won't&mdash;I'll send for a pickaxe."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Inspector," said Standish. "Here is a small
keyhole."</p>

<p>It was barely visible in the pattern of the wood: anyone not
looking for it would never have found it.</p>

<p>"And here's the key that fits it," remarked the Inspector
quietly, as he examined Giuseppi's bunch. "Do you still pretend you
know nothing about it?"</p>

<p>He inserted it in the lock, and gave a heave with his shoulder.
Without a sound a part of the wall swung outwards, revealing a
passage on the other side.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" came a stern voice, and into the light there
stepped a police sergeant in uniform, who saluted as soon as he saw
the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Number 11 Gregory Street," said Standish. "And what is that I
see on the floor?"</p>

<p>He bent and picked up a long brown cord with a tassel at each
end.</p>

<p>"This would seem to belong to your dressing-gown, Giuseppi," he
said quietly. "One wonders why it should be this side of the
door."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">CHAPTER X</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"WELL, sir," said the Inspector half an hour
later, "I don't know that there is anything more to be done here.
It's been a magnificent round up."</p>

<p>"Except for the one big fish," answered Standish a little
bitterly.</p>

<p>"We'll get him, sir. With those blue eyes of his it's only a
question of time."</p>

<p>"And that's the one thing we can't afford at the moment," said
the other. "However, as you say it's been very successful as far as
it goes. Go through all those books and papers, will you, and let
me know anything you may find."</p>

<p>"I will, sir. Good night. Good night, your ladyship."</p>

<p>The four of them were standing on the pavement outside the
entrance to the club. Giuseppi, still protesting volubly, and the
youth from Number 11, had both been removed to the police station:
the street was empty save for one belated taxi, which Standish
inspected carefully before entering.</p>

<p>"I'm taking no risks this trip," he remarked, after giving Lady
Mary's address to the driver. "Zavier must be mad as a civet cat
with you and me, Tiny. We've completely smashed his organization
here in England, to say nothing of collaring thousands of pounds'
worth of dope."</p>

<p>"I wonder if that little sweep Giuseppi is really as ignorant of
things as he pretended to be," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Of course he wasn't ignorant of the fact that those two places
have been run in conjunction for months. But I'm not at all sure he
wasn't speaking the truth when he said he knew nothing about
Zavier. I tried him suddenly with the name, as you heard, and
though I watched him closely I believe his ignorance there was
genuine. It's a damned interesting business, and if it wasn't for
the other affair I should be loving life."</p>

<p>"It's that that is worrying me so frightfully," said the girl.
"We don't seem to be any better off there."</p>

<p>The taxi had stopped outside her house.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Lady Mary," he cried. "We haven't lost yet by a long
chalk."</p>

<p>But his face was grave and preoccupied as they drove back to
Tiny's rooms.</p>

<p>"What do you think his next move will be, Ronald?"</p>

<p>"He will either try and leave the country at once, or he'll have
a dip at you and me. My own candid opinion is the latter. You and I
are the only two people who have seen him, and who know him for
what he is. All the other people who have had dealings with
him&mdash;Berendosi and the rest of them&mdash;have no idea
whatever that he is a cold-blooded murderer. We do, and as long as
we are alive he's not safe. We've broken up his show here, so the
probability is that once he is out of the country it will be some
time before he returns. And that is why I think he will try and do
us in before he goes. He's desperate, and he'll run a big risk to
get us out of the way. So for the love of Allah, old man, keep your
eyes skinned."</p>

<p>"I'll do that all right. It's this cursed negative I'm thinking
of."</p>

<p>"I agree. But the two things march together. If he gets us
good-bye to any chance of ever seeing it."</p>

<p>The taxi pulled up, and Tiny got out. He cast a searching look
up and down the street: as far as he could see there wasn't a soul
in sight.</p>

<p>"Good night, old lad," said Standish. "Inspect your room with a
microscope: sleep with your window shut: and meet me at Gillson's
office at eleven to-morrow. We may hear something fresh about
to-night's raid."</p>

<p>But though Tiny undressed he could not sleep. It was already
dawn: his thoughts kept whirling chaotically. Round and round in a
vicious circle they went, always finishing up with the negative.
Had it all been in vain? Was this swine Zavier going to do them
after all?</p>

<p>He went over the events of the night once more, Surely somewhere
amongst the mass of papers they had obtained, they would find
something which would put them on his trail. And then those bits of
torn brown cloth. He had noticed that Ronald Standish had seemed
strangely interested over them. Again and again his eyes had
returned to the basket with a thoughtful look in them, as if he
felt some clue lay there. And yet what could it be? That Giuseppi
had lied over the dressing-gown was obvious, but beyond that it did
not seem to advance them much.</p>

<p>In a way it was Mary he felt most sorry for. She had done so
much&mdash;striven so hard, and though she had said very little, he
knew how bitterly she had felt the disappointment. What a darling
she was! He rose and began to pace up and down the room. Once or
twice the previous day words had been trembling on the tip of his
tongue&mdash;words he had bitten back. Instinctively he had felt
that until this matter was settled one way or the other she would
resent anything at all personal. Afterwards it would be different,
and somehow he felt distinctly hopeful. There had been a moment in
the taxi coming home, and another at supper before the raid, when
he thought he had read the unmistakable message in her eyes. But
for the time being all that must be in abeyance: to get on with the
job was the order of the day.</p>

<p>At last he heard Murdoch moving about, and ringing the bell he
ordered some breakfast. He wanted exercise: for the past week he
seemed to have been permanently sitting in trains. And a brisk four
miles finishing up with a bathe at the R.A.C. made life seem
distinctly better.</p>

<p>It was still some time before he was to meet Standish at the
Home Office, and going into the smoking-room he glanced over the
morning papers. "The Hampstead Mystery," as it was called, occupied
a prominent place in them all, and he picked up the <i>Daily
Leader</i>.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt," ran the paragraph, "that Mr. Felton Blake
was first stabbed by the young man who was found dead by the safe.
The fingerprints on the handle of the dagger proves this
conclusively. So that over his death there is no mystery. The
strange part of the affair is the death of the murderer, who is at
present unidentified. What happened in that room while the owner of
the house lay dead on the floor? The safe was empty. What happened
to the papers in the safe? Above all, who was the third man whose
footprint was found in the blood by the window, a footprint which
could not have been made by either of the dead men?"</p>

<p>He laid down the paper, and lit a cigarette. Precisely: what had
happened to him? It was a question they all wanted answered. And
then his thoughts turned to Standish's theory. Could it be correct,
could it be that Joe Denver's death was an error, and
unintentional? If so, what was this diabolical contrivance they
were up against that murdered blindly?</p>

<p>It seemed almost incredible, and yet he was forced to admit that
there was some force in Standish's argument. Once granted the
negative had first been removed, why kill Denver? What possible
object could it serve? No one but a madman murders needlessly.</p>

<p>At length he rose: he would go round and see Ronald. Then they
could go together to meet Gillson. The more he thought over things
the more hopelessly befogged did he feel: sitting still was an
impossibility. He walked quickly, hardly noticing the greetings of
two or three men he knew who passed him. And it was not until he
turned into the street where Standish lived that he paused, his
eyes narrowed, a sudden dreadful presentiment clutching at him. For
outside his friend's house a crowd had gathered, and two policemen
were standing in the door.</p>

<p>He elbowed his way through the people, heedless of angry
remarks, and approached one of the constables.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he said. "I was just coming round to see
the gentleman who lives here."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," answered the man gravely, "I'm afraid you won't be
able to. He's dead: burned to death."</p>

<p>"What!" shouted Tiny. "Good God! man, it's impossible. Why, I
only left him three or four hours ago."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir, but it's the truth. Fire engine's been gone some
time."</p>

<p>"Can I go in?" said Tiny dazedly.</p>

<p>"No admittance, sir, unless the Inspector gives permission,"
said the constable firmly.</p>

<p>"Where is the Inspector? Ah! there he is."</p>

<p>It was the same officer who had raided the Fifty-Nine, and the
instant he saw Tiny he beckoned him in.</p>

<p>"This is a bad business, sir," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"But it's unbelievable," cried Tiny. "Mr. Standish&mdash;burned
to death."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked at him queerly.</p>

<p>"There's a bit more in this than meets the eye, sir. It's the
rummiest fire I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"Damn the fire. Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir: he's dead, I'm sorry to say. Do you want to see him?
It's not a pretty sight."</p>

<p>He followed the officer dazedly: the thing was so utterly
unexpected that he felt stunned. It was inconceivable, a fantastic
nightmare: he'd wake up soon, and find he'd been dreaming.</p>

<p>"There, sir." The Inspector opened the door of the room from
which Ronald and he had started for their expedition to Felton
Blake, and it was a moment or two before he could force himself to
enter. The smell of smouldering wood was heavy in the air: the
charred and blackened desk, dripping with water from the fire
engine, was still smoking. But it was not on that that his eyes
were riveted: it was on the twisted figure lying by the hearth-rug.
The knees were drawn up almost to the chin, and by one blistered
hand there lay the remnant of the cloth which had covered the
little table standing by the arm-chair&mdash;the table on which his
reading-lamp had always stood. It had been a fad of
Ronald's&mdash;an oil lamp to read by, and now it lay smashed to
pieces on the floor beside the body.</p>

<p>Here too everything was sopping wet: the rug, the chair, the
body itself had all come under the hose. And at last with an effort
he took a few steps forward and looked at the face. It was burned
beyond recognition: a gruesome, terrible sight.</p>

<p>"My God! Inspector," he muttered, "it's awful. When did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"Early this morning, sir," said the other.</p>

<p>"We went back with Lady Mary, and then he dropped me, and came
on here."</p>

<p>"That would be about it, sir. It was dawn when the man on duty
on this beat, saw smoke coming out of the window. He rang up the
fire station at once, and they had no difficulty in putting it out.
Apparently the oil was concentrated in a pool by his head, and was
already nearly burned out. Then in the ordinary course of events
the Yard was notified. Now I was still working on the papers we got
to-night, but as soon as I heard where the fire was I made a point
of coming round myself. As you see, the features are
unrecognizable. But that's the suit he was wearing: and that's the
tie and tiepin he had on last night."</p>

<p>"Moreover," said Tiny, stooping down and looking at one of the
hands, "that is his signet ring."</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Standish, sir, right enough," went on the other
gravely. "But it's a mighty queer thing. I'd very much like to know
what happened. The doctor suggests that he tried to beat out the
flames with his hands: but it won't do, sir&mdash;it doesn't hold
together."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that, Inspector?" said Tiny slowly.</p>

<p>"Try and reconstruct it, sir, and you'll see for yourself. Mr.
Standish wasn't an invalid, or a cripple. He wasn't a man who
suffered from heart trouble or fainting fits. There is that cloth
by his hand, so it's clear that it was pulling it off the table
that upset the lamp. But why should he pull the cloth off the
table?"</p>

<p>"He might have fainted," suggested Tiny, "and clutched at the
table to save himself."</p>

<p>"Even then, sir, a faint is a faint. That"&mdash;he pointed to
the blackened face&mdash;"didn't take place in a minute, nor yet in
two. Do you mean to tell me, that the agony which must have been
caused by a burn like that wouldn't have brought him to. And then
he wouldn't have gone on lying there. He'd have dashed about the
room: he'd have shouted, put his coat over his head&mdash;done
something, at any rate."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest, then?" said Tiny.</p>

<p>"He was dead before he fell, sir. It's another of the same
cases. We know all about them at the Yard, and if Mr. Standish was
right, and it's that man that gave us the slip who is at the bottom
of them, it's he who was responsible for this. We know that poison
acts suddenly at the last moment, and I believe that as he died he,
as you said, clutched at the table, pulled off the cloth as he
fell, and upset the lamp. But he was dead before he was
burned."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, Inspector," said Tiny slowly.</p>

<p>A cold, over-mastering rage was getting hold of him, the more
dangerous because he was a man who was slow to anger. First Denver:
then Ronald&mdash;his greatest friend.</p>

<p>"By the living God above," he went on quietly, "I'll get even
with the fiend who did this thing. If it's Zavier, then Zavier
shall pay to the uttermost farthing. If it's someone else, I'll get
him if it takes me years."</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Be careful, sir. For unless I'm much mistaken, you are the next
on the list."</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Tiny, his jaw set like a steel trap.
"And even if I swing for it, Inspector, I'll kill the man who did
this, so that his screams will be heard at the other end of
London."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel abruptly, and left the room. Through the
crowd outside he passed as if they were non-existent, and hailed a
taxi. He would see Mary first, then he would put his affairs in
order. And after that...</p>

<p>"I must see her ladyship, Simmonds. I can't help it if she is
still in bed. Ask her to put on a wrap and come down to the
boudoir."</p>

<p>Something in his face precluded further argument, and the butler
went off to find Lady Mary's maid. And a few minutes later she came
downstairs.</p>

<p>"What is it, Tiny?" she cried anxiously. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>"They've got Ronald," he said grimly. "Murdered him last night
after he got back to his rooms."</p>

<p>Slowly the colour ebbed from her face, as she stared at him
speechlessly.</p>

<p>"I've just been round there, and seen the dear old chap's body,"
he went on in the same ominous voice.</p>

<p>She listened in silence while he told her what had happened:
then she went up to him and put her hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully sorry," she said gravely. "Sorry for him, and
sorry for you too, old Tiny, for I know what pals you were. But
it's not going to alter our plans, is it?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Mary?" he said.</p>

<p>"I mean that we&mdash;you and I&mdash;go on just the same," she
cried. "We won't give up hope till the end."</p>

<p>"You bet your life we won't," he answered savagely. "There are
several items now on Mister Zavier's account which have got to be
settled. But there's just one thing, Mary dear, I'd like to
say."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, and she didn't hurry him: only looked
steadily into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm under no delusions," he went on quietly, "as to my
capabilities. I'm a pretty average damned fool, and if this swine
can catch a man like Ronald napping, the chances are that he will
catch me as well."</p>

<p>Her hands tightened on his shoulders, but she still said
nothing.</p>

<p>"I hadn't meant to say anything at present," he continued, "but
this has altered things. You see, dear, as Ronald said last night
after we left you, he and I were bound to be the object of Zavier's
attentions, and now that he has been got it's my turn next. And in
case he succeeds again I'd like you to know that what I said the
other day wasn't a jest. I meant it with every fibre of my being. I
love you."</p>

<p>"Same here, Tiny," she answered quietly. "In fact I've done so
for a considerable time," she added with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Mary, my dear."</p>

<p>His arms went round her, and for a moment or two she let him
hold her with his lips on hers. Then very gently she pushed him
away.</p>

<p>"For we'd never look each other straight in the face again," she
said, "if we didn't do our damndest to beat this brute. So this is
dangerous, old man&mdash;too dangerous altogether. It makes one
want to ease up."</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "believe me there was no thought of that in
my mind."</p>

<p>"There was in mine, Tiny. Do you suppose, dear man, that I don't
realize the danger you are running. And the mere thought of it
makes me sick. So I want you to realize that I'm in it with you.
Two heads are better than one, and it's more than likely I can
help."</p>

<p>He looked at her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, my dear," he said slowly. "It's an infernal
risk."</p>

<p>"Dry up," she laughed. "I don't know that I'll be able to do
anything, but I'm going to have a shot at it. Now first of all
let's try and see exactly where we stand."</p>

<p>"Not much difficulty about that, dear," he said shortly. "Zavier
is after me, and I'm after Zavier. And if I was making a book I
know which of the two would start favourite. I'm no match for the
swine in cunning. Moreover, the devil of it is that as far as I can
see it's a question of sitting down and waiting for him to strike.
One can't go wandering through the streets of London looking for a
man with light-blue eyes."</p>

<p>"If he strikes, Tiny," she said thoughtfully, "he's going to
strike soon. He's not going to stop in this country a day longer
than he can help. So we've just got to sit in one another's pockets
for the next few days. Perhaps he'll make a slip: that's all we can
hope for. You go round now to the Home Office and see this pal of
yours there. Find out if anything fresh has materialized, and then
come back here for lunch."</p>

<p>"Right you are, my dear." He caught her in his arms once again.
"You adorable person," he muttered, and was gone.</p>

<p>He glanced up and down the street as he left, though he realized
the futility of the precaution. If skilled men had failed to spot
the enemy, he was hardly likely to succeed. Then he chartered a
taxi and drove to the Home Office. He found Gillson as quiet and
impassive as ever, studying the documents obtained in last night's
raid.</p>

<p>"By God! Colonel," he burst out, "this is a foul business. I
still simply can't believe it."</p>

<p>"Pretty grim, Carteret," said the other gravely. "I heard you'd
been round."</p>

<p>"Do you agree with the Inspector that he was murdered?" asked
Tiny.</p>

<p>"Looks remarkably like it," answered Gillson. "Well&mdash;that
is the end of it."</p>

<p>"End of it be damned," cried Tiny. "You don't imagine I'm going
to let this drop now, do you? Zavier may get that negative through
to Berendosi&mdash;that I'm afraid he's bound to do now. But he's
killed my best pal, and either he or I are going to follow
Ronald."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Carteret." A gleam of approval showed in
Gillson's eyes. "But I'm afraid you will find the dice loaded
pretty heavily against you."</p>

<p>"No one realizes that more than I do," said the other doggedly.
"But it just can't be helped. Have you found out anything from
those?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the papers on the table.</p>

<p>"A lot," answered Gillson. "Enough to put half a dozen of them
in prison for a long stretch, But of the one vital thing we
wanted&mdash;not a word. There is nothing that gives us a clue to
Zavier, or his main headquarters."</p>

<p>A clerk entered with a type-written sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Will that do, sir?" he said handing it to Gillson, who read
it.</p>

<p>"That is all right," he answered. And then, on a sudden impulse
he passed it to Tiny.</p>

<p>"A shocking tragedy occurred in the early hours of this
morning," it ran, "which but for the prompt action of the Fire
Brigade might have ended in a disastrous fire. Smoke was seen
issuing from one of the rooms of 10 Hooper Street by a constable on
duty. He gave the alarm at once, and the outbreak was soon
extinguished. Unfortunately the owner of the rooms, Mr. Ronald
Standish, perished in the flames. His body was discovered
afterwards so badly burned as to be practically unrecognizable.
Identification was only possible through the deceased man's clothes
and his signet ring. The accident appears to have been caused by an
oil reading-lamp upsetting."</p>

<p>Without a word Tiny handed it back, and not until the clerk left
the room did he speak.</p>

<p>"For the Press, I suppose," he said. "Why no word about the
murder?"</p>

<p>"What's the good?" answered the other. "There is enough hue and
cry already without adding to it."</p>

<p>He rose and stood by the window, hands deep in his trouser
pockets, and Tiny contemplated his back with rising anger.</p>

<p>"Damn it! Colonel," he exploded at length, "you seem to take the
old chap's murder pretty calmly."</p>

<p>"How else is one to take it, Carteret?" said Gillson. "There is
no good running round in small circles biting the blotting paper.
They've got Ronald, and there is no more to be said."</p>

<p>"Isn't there, by Jove," cried the other. "Do you imagine I'm
going to let the matter drop?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"Find this man Zavier if it takes me the rest of my life."</p>

<p>"How are you going to set about it? Look here, my dear fellow,"
went on Gillson kindly, "I know what you are feeling: I know you
are mad with rage. But don't let that distort your vision. As I've
told you, the dice are loaded far too heavily against you. And for
any chance of success we have got to get them a bit more evenly
balanced."</p>

<p>"How do you suggest we should do it?" demanded Tiny.</p>

<p>"Ever done any big-game shooting, Carteret?"</p>

<p>Tiny stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"First you get a nice tree, and in that tree you build yourself
a place where you can sit. Then you get a goat and you put it on
the ground not far from the tree. Then you wait for the tiger to
come and feed. And then you shoot the tiger&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>He swung round and faced Tiny, with the glint of a smile in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"See the point?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do."</p>

<p>"You are the goat. Only I'd prefer that you come out of the
performance alive."</p>

<p>"Deuced considerate of you, Colonel," said Tiny with a grin.</p>

<p>"The flying fellers did it in the war," went on the other. "Sent
slow machines over the Boche lines fairly low to attract the wily
Hun. Then when Fritz was engaged in what looked like a soft job our
fast fighters, who had been up much higher, came down on top of
him. Bait, young Carteret&mdash;that is what you have got to be.
Provided, of course, you feel like going on with it."</p>

<p>"You can take that for granted," answered Tiny quietly.</p>

<p>"Good for you. Though I tell you quite candidly that I don't
think the decision lies in your hands. Whether you want to or not,
you'll have to go through with it: the other bloke is going to see
to that. He wants your head on a charger, and he won't feel safe
until he's got it."</p>

<p>"Quite a number of people seem to share your opinion," remarked
Tiny resignedly. "But there's one point, since we are on the
subject, that might be a bit clearer. The goat we know, and the
tiger, but who is the bird who is going to sit in the tree?"</p>

<p>"I'll see to that, Carteret," said the other. "You'll have to
trust me there implicitly. All I propose to tell you is that he's
the best man available, and if it is humanly possible he won't let
you down."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's all you can tell me, I suppose I'll have to be
content with it. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered the other. "Just live your ordinary life as
if this affair had never been. Of what to warn you against, I know
no more than you. We're still as much in the dark as ever as to how
he commits these murders. So take every precaution you can, and we
can only hope for the best. If he thinks you've dropped the thing,
he may get careless."</p>

<p>He rose and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Carteret. It's not a pleasant job: in fact it's
damned unpleasant. But I'd like to feel we'd got a bit of our own
back over Ronald."</p>

<p>"By Gad! you're right, sir," cried Tiny. "So the motto is,
Business as usual."</p>

<p>"That's it," said the other, and Tiny turning at the door saw
that Gillson was already immersed again in the documents in front
of him.</p>

<p>He walked slowly along the passage and out into the street. That
Gillson was right, he realized. Since the chances of his finding
Zavier in London were infinitesimal, the only thing to do was to
wait until Zavier found him. And that was a simple matter,
especially if he lived his normal life. His rooms were known: his
club was known: there was no secrecy about his movements. In fact
it all seemed delightfully simple&mdash;a feeling doubtless shared
by the goat.</p>

<p>He paused in the Park, and looked behind him. Was one of that
hurrying crowd the man with the gun who was sitting in the tree?
And was another of them the tiger? And then he realized suddenly
that he was doing a foolish thing. When it is business as usual,
one does not stop and peer into the faces of passers-by. If he was
going to play the part he would play it properly. He would blot out
the events of the last few days from his mind as Gillson had said.
Was it not beer time, and there was at least an hour before he was
due to lunch with Mary.</p>

<p>He strolled along Pall Mall, and turned into his club. Already
the news about Ronald seemed to have got round, and he was
immediately besieged by members clamouring for details. Mindful of
the official statement he had been shown he made no mention of the
word murder, and as soon as he could he shook them off and buried
himself behind a paper. Here at any rate he could relax: Zavier
couldn't get him in his own club.</p>

<p>And that brought him back to the question of Mary. When they had
decided to join forces, he had not seen Gillson. The whole thing
had been vague and indefinite. Now a very different complexion had
been put on the matter. In the rôle of goat which he now had to
fill, the one place of all others where she must not be was
anywhere near him. The danger was far too great.</p>

<p>He hesitated for awhile as to whether he would ring her up and
say he was not coming to lunch, but thinking it over he decided to
go after all. There was a lot to explain to her, and it could not
be done over the telephone. But lunch was going to be positively
their last appearance together until things were settled one way or
the other. She would make a fuss about it, he knew, but her
objections would have to be got over. It would cramp his style and
spoil his nerve far too much if he felt there was any risk for her.
The game had got to be played as a lone hand, with the man in the
tree a shadowy figure in the background.</p>

<p>At a quarter to one he left the club, wondering what was the
best way to persuade her. If he stressed the danger side of it it
was quite sufficient to make a girl like her all the more
determined to face it with him. And if he did not there was no
valid reason why she should back out. And he was still undecided
when he pressed the bell. He would have to stress the point that it
would make it more difficult for him.</p>

<p>Mechanically he handed his hat and stick to Simmonds, and walked
towards the boudoir, suddenly to become aware that the butler was
delivering himself of startled noises.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he said turning round. "Her ladyship is
expecting me to lunch, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"But, sir," stammered the man, "Her ladyship went with you to
Paris by the midday boat train."</p>

<p>Tiny stood very still. The statement was so staggeringly
unexpected, that for a moment or two his brain refused to act. All
that he was conscious of was the monotonous ticking of the hall
clock.</p>

<p>"What in Heaven's name are you talking about?" he got out at
length. "To Paris&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'll tell you what happened. And Janet here can bear
me out."</p>

<p>Tiny looked round to see that the maid had appeared, and was
looking at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"About half an hour after you left this morning, sir," went on
the butler, "a lady called. She wanted to see her ladyship and she
told me to say that she was a friend of a Countess Mazarin. Also
that it was urgent, and that she had just come from you. She held a
letter in her hand, sir, which however, she did not give to me. I
at once told Janet, and as her ladyship was dressed she came down
immediately. She took the letter, and read it through standing here
in the hall. And then, sir, though it didn't strike me at the time,
not thinking that anything could be wrong, a most extraordinary
expression came on her face. She had half turned her back on the
other lady, and only I could see it. It was&mdash;how shall I say,
sir&mdash;sort of half puzzled and amazed. And then it changed. Her
frown went away, and she got that look, sir, that I remember when
she was a kiddy, and was told not to do a thing she wanted to do.
She'd made up her mind.</p>

<p>"'There's only just time to catch the train,' she said, turning
to the other lady. 'Will you walk into my parlour?' she went on,
and it was such a funny thing for her to say, that I stared at
her&mdash;'Will you walk into my parlour while I throw a few things
into a bag?'</p>

<p>"She went upstairs, sir, and for some reason Janet wasn't there.
Anyway she was down again in a minute carrying her little
dressing-case. Then she went into the boudoir, and the two of them
came out together.</p>

<p>"'I hadn't expected to go to Paris at quite such short notice,'
she said as she passed me, 'I do hope Mr. Carteret will catch the
train.'</p>

<p>"And that's all I know, sir. But you will understand how
surprised I was to see you."</p>

<p>"What on earth can it all mean?" said Tiny dazedly. "I never had
the slightest intention of going to Paris."</p>

<p>Mechanically he had opened the door of the boudoir, and now he
stood staring round the room. A letter was lying on the
writing-table, and as his eyes fell on it they slowly dilated in
amazement. Then, heedless of the two servants, he darted across the
room and picked it up.</p>

<p>"A scrawl, dear," it ran, "to say that the most extraordinary
development has taken place. The bearer of this note is a pal of
Nada Mazarin, who is in Paris now. She wants us both to go over
there by the eleven o'clock boat train. Hotel Majestic. Will catch
it if I possibly can. Tiny."</p>

<p>He stood by the table as if carved out of stone while the two
servants watched him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Is this the note that woman brought?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"From the glimpse I got of the envelope, sir," said Simmonds,
"it looks the same writing."</p>

<p>"I suppose we are not all mad," remarked Tiny.</p>

<p>He read through the note once again: then with a hopeless
gesture he threw it back on the desk. <i>For the writing was the
writing of Ronald Standish</i>.</p>

<p>"For the love of Allah, Simmonds, give me a drink. I've got to
try and think this thing out."</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair. What on earth did the thing mean?
Why should Ronald write a letter to her and sign it "Tiny" after he
was dead? For a time a wild hope surged up in him. Did it mean that
Ronald was alive: that the scorched and blackened body had belonged
to someone else? But he soon dismissed the possibility, principally
because he failed to see, even with the wildest stretch of
imagination, what possible object could have been served by sending
such a note if it was Ronald who had done it. He would have known
that Mary would spot it at once as a forgery.</p>

<p>A forgery: the thing was a forgery. That was obvious. Someone
had written her a note purporting to come from him, and had
committed the trifling error of employing the wrong writing. How it
had happened was beside the point: even the fact that it was
Ronald's writing was not the main issue&mdash;as far as he knew
Mary had never seen it. But she had sampled his own often enough.
Therefore, she had realized it was a forgery. Why, then, had she
gone to Paris?</p>

<p>And gradually light dawned on him. Deliberately, and with her
eyes open she had walked into the trap. Her remark to the woman
which had stuck in Simmonds' mind came back to him.</p>

<p>"Will you walk into my parlour?"</p>

<p>He supplied the end without difficulty. With complete disregard
of danger she had elected to play the rôle of the fly, in an
endeavour to locate the spider. He could see it all: the puzzled
frown as she first read the letter: the sudden set of that small
jaw as she came to a decision. And then the calm carrying through
of the thing so that the woman should not suspect that she
suspected.</p>

<p>"You priceless kid," he muttered ecstatically.</p>

<p>She had left the letter there on the desk on purpose that he
should see it. She knew that the instant he did, he would realize
the error, and act accordingly. And she had been careful not even
to telephone him, for fear of rousing the woman's suspicions. All
the information he required was given by the note.</p>

<p>Exactly: and the fact started another train of thought. What was
their object in getting Mary to Paris. Obviously as bait for him.
It was Gillson's plan over again, only this time he was to be the
tiger and Mary the goat. And suddenly he began to laugh: they did
not lack audacity.</p>

<p>He grew grave again. Astoundingly plucky though she was, this
was no show for a girl to be in alone. It was time he got a move
on. The Hotel Majestic was his destination, and at once. Gillson's
instructions must go by the board: this development altered
everything. Mary was first, second and last. The two o'clock
service would not get him there until ten, which was too late. A
special aeroplane was the only thing.</p>

<p>"Get me a car, Simmonds," he cried. "At once. Then ring up the
Home Office."</p>

<p>He would speak to Gillson, explaining what had happened. But
when he got through Gillson was not to be found, nor had he arrived
at his club. And so he scribbled a note, and gave it to Simmonds to
send round. Then, the car having arrived, he started for Croydon,
nearly knocking down a man from the Telephone Exchange as he ran
down the steps.</p>

<p>"Bloke seems in a bit of an 'urry," said the man. "Is this 'ere
the habode of Lady Mary Ridgeway?"</p>

<p>"It is," said Simmonds. "And what might you be wanting?"</p>

<p>"She's put in a complaint about the hextension of 'er telephone.
Lead me to it, Gussie."</p>

<p>"In there," remarked Simmonds coldly. "And kindly reserve your
funny business for them that appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Try sitting on a drawing pin, Adolphus," laughed the other.
"You look dead from the neck down. This room, is it?"</p>

<p>He went to the instrument, and for a few moments Simmonds
watched him from the door. Then he stalked majestically to his own
quarters.</p>

<p>And with his departure the interest of the telephone operator in
his job faded rapidly. His eyes darted round the room, to rivet
themselves on the note Tiny had thrown down on the desk. And if
Tiny had been amazed, this man seemed literally dumbfounded as he
read the letter.</p>

<p>A door opened somewhere, and he returned to the instrument.</p>

<p>"Seems all right now, Clarence," he said as Simmonds reappeared.
"Only I won't guarantee it if you breathe down it. So long,
matey."</p>

<p>Two hours later the second private aeroplane of the day rose
from Croydon. Moreover, its occupant bore a striking resemblance to
a certain very temporary member of the London telephone staff.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was seven o'clock that night that Tiny realized
how completely he had blundered. Since five he had been sitting in
the entrance-hall of the Majestic, watching the door. A consignment
of Americans from London had arrived by the Golden Arrow: a few
more people had come by the ordinary boat train, but of Mary there
had been no sign. And at last he saw what a fool he had been. The
other side had never had any intention of her going to the Majestic
at all.</p>

<p>He marvelled that such an obvious point could have escaped him.
How could they let Mary meet him in a crowded hotel lounge?
Believing as they did that the letter they had forged to her was in
his writing, they would assume that she was quite unsuspicious. But
at the first word she spoke to Tiny she would realize the whole
trap. That, naturally, was the way they must look at it.</p>

<p>So it boiled down to the fact that he had come at maximum speed
to the one spot in the whole of Europe where there was not the
slightest chance of finding her. And the point now arose as to what
would be the next move on their part. That Zavier would know by
this time that he had come to the Majestic was practically a
certainty. Any one of the men&mdash;or women&mdash;sitting round
him might be a spy. So what was going to happen now?</p>

<p>He could do nothing himself except sit and wait. It was the rôle
of the goat to perfection, and had it not been for the maddening
anxiety over Mary he could have obtained a certain amount of
cynical amusement out of it. But what were they doing with her?
Common sense told him that it was unlikely she would come to any
physical harm: from Zavier's point of view such a thing would be
foolish, because it was unnecessary. And as long as she continued
to act her part of suspecting nothing she would, at any rate, be
safe. Nevertheless, the mere thought of her playing a lone hand
drove him nearly crazy with worry. She might be literally anywhere:
she might not even be in Paris. If he could even know that it would
be something.</p>

<p>And it was at that stage in his reflections that happening to
look up he saw one of Cook's couriers standing by the concierge's
desk. The man caught his eye at the same moment, and after a
momentary hesitation saluted. And it suddenly dawned on Tiny that
not only was he from the Gare du Nord, but that he was the
identical man who had on one occasion looked after Mary and a pal
of hers who was ill, when they were going to Nice. Tiny had gone as
far as Paris with them himself, and he recognized the man
perfectly. He was evidently fixing up some luggage question, and
acting on a sudden impulse Tiny crossed and spoke to him. Only a
hundred-to-one chance? but still a chance. Had he seen Mary?</p>

<p>"Lady Mary Ridgeway, sir? Why, funnily enough&mdash;I did. I was
standing outside, where you get a taxi, and I saw her plain."</p>

<p>"Was anyone with her?"</p>

<p>"Another lady, sir. They got into a car and drove off."</p>

<p>"What sort of a car?"</p>

<p>"A big private one, sir. One of the large Renaults."</p>

<p>"You didn't hear where they went?"</p>

<p>"No, sir: I didn't. They just got in and the car went straight
away."</p>

<p>The man hesitated a moment, and looked at Tiny curiously.</p>

<p>"Seemed to me, sir, as if her ladyship was expecting someone.
She kept looking round over her shoulder, and peering into the
crowd."</p>

<p>Tiny thanked him and resumed his seat. Of course, she'd been
looking for him. He should have met the train, not sat doing
nothing in the hotel. And yet as things panned out he couldn't have
done much good. Following a Renault is somewhat beyond the powers
of a Paris taxi. For all that he cursed himself for not having been
there: he would have stopped the whole thing then and there.</p>

<p>In an overwhelming wave all his fears had come back to him.
There was something ominous about that big car driving straight
away, without a word to the driver. Just one more link in the
skilfully constructed chain that seemed to be tightening round
them. And there was a ruthless efficiency about it all that made
him feel helpless. If only he could do something, and not merely
have to sit and wait.</p>

<p>At length he went in to dinner. Either there would be a further
development soon, or they were going to try and get him in the
hotel: anyway food was indicated. He had had nothing to eat since
breakfast, and hunger is a bad preparation for a crisis. And he
felt instinctively that one was approaching: Zavier would not delay
an instant longer than necessary. He glanced round the room
wondering if any of his fellow-diners were even shadowing him. Most
of them were in evening clothes, and it was at the others that he
principally directed his attention. But after a while the futility
of the proceeding struck him, and he concentrated on his meal. They
could recognize him, and he couldn't recognize them; at that it had
to be left.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that a new-comer had sat down at the
next table. He was a thin, sandy haired little man, and his
clothes&mdash;although scrupulously neat&mdash;showed signs of
wear. The elbow he lifted as he studied the menu shone suspiciously
in the light, and Tiny shrewdly suspected that the seat of his
trousers would reveal the same story. In short, not the type of
customer one would expect at the Majestic, and for that reason Tiny
studied him covertly.</p>

<p>After a while he realized the man was shooting quick little
bird-like glances at him, and instantly all his suspicions were
aroused. Was the next move about to start? He continued his dinner
calmly, only moving his chair just sufficiently to enable him to
watch the man more easily. A feeling of relief had come over him:
anything was better than inaction. And he felt certain the
new-comer was one of the players.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes, however, before the game started, and then
the opening gambit was so unexpected that he almost decided he had
been mistaken.</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, you can't tell me what has happened in the
Yorkshire and Middlesex match?"</p>

<p>Tiny stared at him blankly: so the man was English.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't," he said at length. "You are interested in
cricket?" he added perfunctorily.</p>

<p>"Very. I play for my bank here."</p>

<p>A bank clerk, was he? And bank clerks do not generally dine at
the Majestic.</p>

<p>"Am I right, sir, in supposing that you are Mr. Carteret, the
Rugby player?"</p>

<p>Getting down to it, reflected Tiny, but what the deuce was
coming next?</p>

<p>"My name is Carteret," he answered briefly.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the other. "It was lucky I'd seen your
photograph so often in the papers, otherwise I might not have been
able to help the lady."</p>

<p>"What's that; you're saying?" said Tiny tensely.</p>

<p>"There's danger, sir, danger. Finish your dinner quickly and
come to the bar. I daren't talk here."</p>

<p>"I've finished," said Tiny. "I'll wait for you there."</p>

<p>He settled his bill, and left the room. Then he went to the bar
where the other joined him almost immediately.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said, after a cautious glance round. "I'll tell
you all I know. I'd been on my bicycle to see some friends outside
Paris, and I came back through the Porte de la Gare. That would be
about half-past six. Drawn up by the side of the road was one of
the big Renaults, and inside it were two ladies. Something had
evidently gone wrong, because the bonnet was up and the chauffeur
and another man were bending over the engine. Just as I got
alongside, one of the ladies got out and went and stood by the two
men. She seemed to be talking to them earnestly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know why, but I happened to look at the other one
who was still inside the car, and it fairly gave me a shock. She
was staring at me fixedly, and suddenly she deliberately opened the
window and dropped her vanity bag on the road. Deliberately, sir:
no question of an accident. Of course, that attracted my attention
still more. I was pushing my machine at the time, and I stopped at
once and handed back the bag.</p>

<p>"She took it, and at the same instant, I felt a twisted note
pushed into my hand.</p>

<p>"'Merci,' she said.</p>

<p>"'Not at all,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Thank God! you're English,' she muttered. 'Give that to Mr.
Carteret&mdash;Majestic Hotel. There's danger. It's urgent.'</p>

<p>"'The football player?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'That's the one,' she answered, and then she gave a smile.
'Thank you so much for picking it up.'</p>

<p>"For a moment I couldn't understand: then I saw the other lady
was watching us. So I took off my hat, and mounted my bike."</p>

<p>"Have you got the note?" interrupted Tiny.</p>

<p>"Here it is, sir."</p>

<p>He handed the slip of paper to Tiny, who unrolled it eagerly.
Inside, in a hurried scrawl which, however, was obviously Mary's,
was the one word "Brig."</p>

<p>"What the devil does it mean?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Carteret," said the other a little apologetically, "I
have to admit that I took a liberty. The whole thing was so strange
that when I got out of sight I dismounted and opened the note.
'Brig,' I said to myself, 'that's a funny message.' And after a
time I turned my machine and rode back again, to find that the car
had gone. Now I happen to know one of the men at that gate very
well&mdash;I use it a lot&mdash;and acting on an impulse I decided
to have a talk with him. Quite casually I turned the conversation
round to the big car.</p>

<p>"It appeared that the chauffeur had been cursing like blazes at
the breakdown, because he had such a long drive in front of him. My
pal had said that there was a second driver, and the chauffeur had
remarked that they wanted three on such a trip.</p>

<p>'Four hundred and fifty kilometres to the frontier,' he had
grumbled, 'and another two hundred on.'</p>

<p>"Well, that was all I could get out of him, so I got on my bike
again and went back to my rooms. Now it so happens that I'm a bit
of a map fiend, and what with this curious message and the
chauffeur's remarks, I got down some of my maps and had a look. And
I can't help thinking I've solved it: in fact I'm sure I have."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" said Tiny eagerly.</p>

<p>"First of all, Mr. Carteret, take the gate they were leaving
by&mdash;the Porte de la Gare. That's the gate you leave by for
Dijon, and after that Switzerland."</p>

<p>He paused impressively, while Tiny possessed his soul in
patience.</p>

<p>"Secondly," went on the little man, "the Swiss frontier is just
about four hundred and fifty kilometres from Paris."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Tiny, as Ronald's words in Lausanne came back to
him. "I believe you're right."</p>

<p>"Well, if I'm right so far, sir, I have solved it. Brigue, which
is the Swiss end of the Simplon tunnel, is another two hundred or
so kilometres farther on. They spell it both ways&mdash;Brigue and
Brig."</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Just half-past eight, Mr. Carteret. There's a train at 9.10. If
you hurry you can catch it."</p>

<p>For a moment Tiny hesitated. Was it genuine, or was it all part
of some elaborate trap? And then with a shrug of his shoulders he
made up his mind. Anything was better than staying on in the
Majestic.</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to you," he said, holding out his hand. "I'll
go at once."</p>

<p>He hurried over to the concierge's desk to confirm the time of
the train, and countermanded his room. A Frenchman with a small
pointed, black beard was having an excited argument over something,
but he politely stood on one side as Tiny approached.</p>

<p>"9.10, Monsieur. That is correct. Shall I get you a taxi?" He
gave an order to a chausseur. "Will you be wanting a sleeper?"</p>

<p>He paused as the Frenchman made some remark.</p>

<p>"Because, if so, sir," he went on, "this gentleman suggests that
you might perhaps care to share one with him."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tiny grimly. "I shall not be wanting a
sleeper."</p>

<p>No more sleepers for him, he reflected, unless he knew his
fellow- traveller. And a Frenchman with a beard struck him quite
definitely as being a suspicious character under existing
circumstances. Not that he could be, of course: he had been talking
to the concierge before Tiny came up. But the principle held. No
unknown men: certainly no unknown beavers.</p>

<p>"The taxi is here, sir," said the concierge, and the last words
Tiny heard as he left the hotel were&mdash;"<i>Un autre, pour
Monsieur</i>."</p>

<p>The train was not full, and he had no difficulty in getting a
first-class corner seat. On purpose he chose a compartment that was
not empty: though he had no intention of sleeping he was not
neglecting any precaution. And by no stretch of imagination could
anyone already seated in one particular carriage selected at
random, be involved in the matter: the coincidence would be too
extraordinary.</p>

<p>He selected a corner next to the corridor, and it was just as
the train started that he got a bit of a shock. Standing in the
door of the next compartment was Black Beard. True&mdash;if looked
at from one point of view there was nothing very surprising in the
fact. From what the concierge had said the man was going to travel
by this train, and probably he had been unable to get a sleeper.
That was all there was to it, and yet...</p>

<p>Zavier, when the Fifty-Nine Club had been raided, had worn a
beard. Was it possible that this man was Zavier himself? As far as
he remembered his eyes were not blue, but he had taken very little
notice of him at the Majestic. Anyway, that was a point which could
easily be settled. He went into the corridor, and looked into the
next compartment. The man had put on a pair of tinted glasses, and
was reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Tiny returned to his seat and shut the door. Was it Zavier?
could it be? If so, was he going to strike on the train? His jaw
set grimly. Ass he might be, but at any rate on this occasion he
was forewarned. And he proposed to give the gentleman a run for his
money. If only he was not in such an agonizing condition of
uncertainty over Mary....</p>

<p>Came Laroche, and his mind went back to the last time he had
done this same journey. It was there, according to Ronald, they had
got the Russian, and instinctively he kept his eyes glued on the
small expanse of open window opposite him. Would some strange
mysterious thing come through and strike him? Then he happened to
glance into the corridor: the bearded man was standing outside his
compartment watching him intently. For an instant he had a wild
idea of tackling him then and there: but he dismissed it. So long
as he kept his door shut nothing could get at him from that side at
any rate, and his job was to get to Brigue.</p>

<p>At last the train started again and Tiny relaxed. Strong as his
nerves were the strain was beginning to tell on him, and he found
himself longing for the daylight. And then, to keep his mind
occupied he tried to work out a plan of campaign for what he should
do when he arrived at Brigue. He remembered the place
hazily&mdash;a small typical Swiss town at the east end of the
Rhone valley. It seemed the last place in the world where one would
expect to meet with adventure, and yet the little clerk's solution
appeared correct. Moreover, Ronald had said that the headquarters
were somewhere in Switzerland.</p>

<p>But what to do when he got there was the problem. Presumably
there would be no difficulty in tracing such a conspicuous car as a
big Renault if it had already reached the place: and if the train
got there first he could keep a look-out for it. After that events
would have to shape themselves.</p>

<p>Dawn came at length and he stretched himself wearily. The
bearded man had not appeared again: the halts at Dijon and the
subsequent station had passed without incident. At Lausanne his
fellow-travellers alighted, and from then on he had the carriage to
himself. An attendant announced breakfast, and Tiny, after a
moment's hesitation, rose and stepped into the corridor. After all,
nothing much could happen in broad daylight. And the next instant
he laughed softly to himself. The next compartment was empty: the
bearded man was no longer there.</p>

<p>"Might have had an easier night, if I'd known that," he
reflected. "The wretched fellow was probably a harmless commercial
traveller."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock they reached Brigue, and for a while he stood
undecided on the platform. He had vaguely thought of the
possibility of some message awaiting him, but there was no one who
looked in the least like a messenger. He would have to make for the
town and ask there. The local <i>gendarme</i>, however, proved the
first difficulty. Doubtless the worthy man did his best, but at the
end of five minutes all he could do was gravely to indicate the
church. Then, with a hoarse grunt of satisfaction at having at last
interpreted Tiny's question, he relapsed into his habitual
stupor.</p>

<p>It was an hotel proprietor who stepped into the breach.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance, sir?" he asked in perfect
English.</p>

<p>Tiny heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to find out," he explained, "if a big Renault car
has passed through here this morning? It would have come from
Paris, with two ladies on board and two chauffeurs."</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not that I'm aware of, sir. But I will make inquiries, and if
you would care to come into the hotel, I can put you in an
excellent position."</p>

<p>He led the way to a small beer garden fronting the main
street.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said, "anyone coming from Paris must pass you
here. The road forks down there to the left&mdash;one branch over
the Simplon, the other over the Furka. So whichever pass they are
going to take, they must come by here."</p>

<p>"Splendid fellow," cried Tiny. "Send out a magnum of ale."</p>

<p>And even as he spoke his eyes narrowed. A man had crossed the
street some thirty yards away, and he could have sworn it was the
bearded Frenchman of the Majestic. He half rose, then sank back
again in his chair: the man had disappeared. It was useless to try
and follow him, if not dangerous, but it gave Tiny a jolt. Why had
he changed his carriage in the train, and what was he doing in
Brigue?</p>

<p>The beer came and, with great rapidity, was gone. And after
awhile Tiny began to feel drowsy. Periodically a car passed along
the hot, airless street, but of the big Renault there was no sign.
And with increasing frequency his head fell forward as he dozed.
Which perhaps was just as well for his peace of mind. For had he
been his usual alert self he might have noticed a strange
phenomenon in the window of a house some thirty yards away. For
curtains do not move suddenly when there is no wind unless someone
is there touching them. And had that elementary fact penetrated
Tiny's brain, he might have seen a small object which lay on the
sill&mdash;circular and black: an object which bore a strange
resemblance to the muzzle of a gun when pointed at the observer.
And had he got as far as that he might have looked even more
closely. In which case he might have caught a glimpse through the
opening of the curtains of a black-bearded face peering motionless
and patiently over the sights of a rifle. And the analogy of the
tiger and the goat might have struck him unpleasantly. But none of
these things happened: he dozed.</p>

<p>A hand on his shoulder awoke him with a start: the hotel
proprietor was standing at his side.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said gravely, "I fear I have some bad news for
you. Is your name Carteret?"</p>

<p>"It is," said Tiny, getting up. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>And then he noticed that behind the speaker a monk was
standing.</p>

<p>"There has been an accident, sir&mdash;a bad accident."</p>

<p>With a gesture he indicated the monk.</p>

<p>"My son," said the latter in a deep voice, "you must prepare for
a shock. Early this morning there were brought to the monastery two
men and two women. One of the men was dead, and one of the women:
the others were badly injured. It appeared that their car had
overturned at a dangerous corner, and fallen some thirty feet into
a ravine. Two hours ago the injured lady recovered consciousness.
She could barely speak, but she kept saying&mdash;'Monsieur
Carteret&mdash;Brigue. Monsieur Carteret&mdash;Brigue.' So the
Brother in charge sent me to see if I could find you."</p>

<p>"Get a car quick," said Tiny curtly.</p>

<p>"My son," answered the monk, "we have a car at the monastery. It
is outside now."</p>

<p>"What about a doctor?"</p>

<p>"A doctor is with her now."</p>

<p>"Is there no hope?"</p>

<p>The monk crossed himself.</p>

<p>"It is in the hands of <i>le bon Dieu</i>. Come: the car is on
the other side of the hotel."</p>

<p>Almost stunned by the unexpectedness of it, Tiny followed the
monk. Mary dying: the thing was impossible.</p>

<p>"But how did it happen?" he cried distractedly.</p>

<p>Laboriously the monk wound up an ancient Fiat, and climbed
in.</p>

<p>"On the road to Gletsch, my son, are many dangerous turnings.
Moreover, in places it is very narrow. Last night in the mountains
there was rain, and one stretch in particular became greasy. It was
there that it happened. The car must have skidded: that is all we
can think."</p>

<p>"Can't you get some more speed out of this cursed machine?"
muttered Tiny.</p>

<p>"My son," said the other gently, "we are only a poor order. What
little we have is given to <i>les pauvres</i>&mdash;not used in
buying a new car."</p>

<p>"Sorry," grunted Tiny. "Only, you see I happen to be engaged to
the lady. Do we pass the place where the accident occurred?"</p>

<p>"No. It is a mile beyond our doors. The villagers carried the
bodies to us."</p>

<p>They drove in silence, till they came to a place like the side
of a cliff, up which the road zigzagged. And it was when they were
half way up that, looking down, Tiny saw below them another car
with a solitary man in it. The driver's face was hidden by his hat,
but a glance told him that the car was a Lancia, and therefore
capable of some three times the speed of his present
conveyance.</p>

<p>"There's a man behind us in a fast car," he said. "Do you mind
if I ask him for a lift when he overtakes us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the monk. "I understand what you must be
feeling. We will stop him when he passes us."</p>

<p>But though Tiny, glancing back from time to time, could see the
other car it never appeared to get any nearer. The driver seemed to
be deliberately regulating his speed by the Fiat, and after a while
he resigned himself to his present conveyance. And then, at last,
when he felt he could bear it no longer, his companion spoke.</p>

<p>"Nearly there," he said. "That building on the left is the
monastery."</p>

<p>Tiny took a deep breath: in a few moments now he would know the
worst. Was she still alive? Was there any hope? With a creaking of
brakes the car pulled up, and he dashed to the door.</p>

<p>"Patience, my son," said the deep voice behind him. "We have
rules in our fraternity which must be obeyed."</p>

<p>Chafing with impatience Tiny waited while the monk knocked three
times on the door. And so completely impervious was he to
everything save the thought of Mary, that he did not even notice
that the Lancia had pulled up some twenty yards away, while the
driver peered under the bonnet as if to discover some defect.</p>

<p>At length a small panel slid back and he saw a pair of eyes
looking at him. Then his companion said something in a language he
did not know, and the door was opened.</p>

<p>"Is the lady dead?" he cried in an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>Once again there was a remark in an unknown tongue, and then the
monk who had driven him turned to him with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, my son: she is not. And the doctor is most hopeful. Follow
me."</p>

<p>He led the way along a stone corridor, with Tiny at his heels,
until he came to a large vaulted room&mdash;a room which was
divided into two parts by a steel grille.</p>

<p>"Wait here," he said. "I will find the doctor, and bring him to
you."</p>

<p>His footsteps echoed on the stone flags till they died away in
the distance. And Tiny, fuming at the delay strode up and down the
room. Suddenly he paused. From the direction of the front door had
come a short stifled groan. He listened intently: it was not
repeated. And then, for the first time, he became aware of the
deathly silence of the place. Not a sound of a voice: not a sound
of any sort. The building was like a tomb. He walked over to the
steel grille and examined it: it was let into the stone-work on
each side, and reached right up to the ceiling. In each half of the
room were a table and chair, and he concluded that it must be the
place where the monks interviewed callers.</p>

<p>He turned round: would the doctor never come? A grille similar
to the one he had been examining was slowly closing across the
entrance to the room. For a moment he stood rigid&mdash;too amazed
to move: then, with a shout, he dashed at it. And even as he
reached it, it clanged home.</p>

<p>He tugged at it desperately: it was as immovable as the one in
the centre of the room. And suddenly he realized the truth: the
whole thing was a trap into which he had not only walked, but had
galloped at full speed. Instinctively his hand went to his pocket,
and he cursed savagely. His revolver was in his bag at the
hotel.</p>

<p>"That simplifies matters, doesn't it, Mr. Carteret," came a
suave voice, and he swung round.</p>

<p>Standing on the other side of the central grille was another
monk&mdash;a monk with pale-blue, unwinking eyes. He was face to
face with Zavier himself.</p>

<p>"Had you had your revolver I might have had to forgo the
pleasure of a little chat with you," continued Zavier genially.
"Dodging bullets in a room like this with nasty stone walls is not
a pastime I care about."</p>

<p>"Damn you," said Tiny between his teeth. "How is Lady Mary?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know, in the very best of health," answered the
other. "But whether she is still in Paris, or has returned to
London I can't tell you."</p>

<p>"So the whole thing has been a lie from beginning to end."</p>

<p>A futile rage had seized him, which even the knowledge that Mary
was safe did little to calm.</p>

<p>"Naturally," laughed Zavier. "But really, Mr. Carteret, you were
a little too easy. I mean one does like a certain amount of run for
one's money."</p>

<p>"What the devil are you going to do with me? Murder me, I
suppose, like the others, you damned swine."</p>

<p>"I fear that that is your ultimate end undoubtedly," agreed
Zavier. "You see, my dear Mr. Carteret, I have the gravest
objection to people being at large who know me: or rather, I might
put it, who associate me with my activities."</p>

<p>"Get it over, for God's sake," shouted Tiny. "You can play me
like a sitting hen if you want to."</p>

<p>"True: very true. But at the moment I don't want to. As I said
before, I should like a little chat. It is so rare, Mr. Carteret,
that one has the chance of discussing things with one's adversaries
in safety. And I have a little pardonable vanity, you know. Now the
first time I met you was in the sleeper just after that foolish
fellow Demeroff had paid the just penalty for his offence."</p>

<p>"So you were the monk, were you?" said Tiny, interested in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"I was the monk. And my object in visiting your compartment, my
dear fellow, was not, believe me, to breathe a prayer over the dear
departed, but to make quite sure that the right one of you had
departed. By the way, that reminds me. From information I have
received I am given to understand that considerable doubt exists in
the minds of the authorities as to how these regrettable accidents
take place. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Go to hell," grunted Tiny.</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't answer, you won't. Still, my information is
generally reliable. To turn to another subject. What do you think
of this idea of mine for disguise purposes? You have no idea how
free from suspicion a monk or a nun remains. If one twiddles a few
beads, and mutters hoarsely under one's breath, the police of two
continents hold up the traffic for you. Besides, on occasions, when
the attentions of those who one wishes to avoid become too
pressing, and ports are being watched and things like that, I have
found but little difficulty in prevailing upon the master of some
small tramp to smuggle me on board. I plead extreme poverty and
thereby touch his heart. However, I fear I shall have to adopt
something new in the future."</p>

<p>He sighed, and lit one of his little cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall have to think of something fresh. I could not
destroy that cassock at the Fifty-Nine Club, and it can't be long
before your admirable police appreciate its significance. In fact,
I wouldn't be surprised if your friend Mr. Standish hadn't spotted
the truth before his regrettable end. Burned to death. Poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>"You nauseating hypocrite," snarled Tiny. "You know perfectly
well he was not burned to death. You murdered him, as you murdered
young Denver."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Carteret, believe me you are wrong there. True,
the young man died, but I can assure you that it was the last thing
I intended. You see, I happened to know that you and Standish
proposed to pay Blake a visit, and it was for you that the scene
was laid. And then your young friend Denver went and butted in in
front of you."</p>

<p>"How did you know Standish and I were going there?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you under-estimate my resources. For what other
reason would you wire Lady Mary to get Blake out of his house from
eleven to one. Useful, that wire&mdash;very useful. It gave me a
specimen of your writing, which came in very handy for my little
note to Lady Mary."</p>

<p>"Well, you're damned well wrong there, Zavier. Standish wrote
that wire, and signed it with my name."</p>

<p>"Dear me! You don't say so." He seemed genuinely upset. "You
can't believe how I dislike anything that savours of a blunder. So
that letter to Lady Mary was in Standish's writing. You surprise
me. Why then did she go to Paris?"</p>

<p>"To try and run you to earth," said Tiny savagely. "She knew it
was a trap..."</p>

<p>"And she deliberately walked into it," said the other with an
amused smile. "Plucky, but foolish. And I fear rather useless.
Well, what message shall I give Signor Berendosi from you? Strange,
isn't it, what a lot of trouble has been caused by such a small
thing as that."</p>

<p>With a mocking laugh he held up the negative, and Tiny looked at
it moodily. Heavens! what a consummate fool he had been. Looking
back now he marvelled how he could ever have believed the so-called
clerk's story in Paris for a second. And yet, at the time, it had
seemed to ring true. And then the next one about the accident.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Mr. Carteret," cried Zavier. "Admittedly you haven't
been very bright, but though I say it myself I am a little bit
above your form. And you have had a charming trip to a very
delightful part of the country. I shall be leaving you shortly, and
I don't quite know when anyone will find your ... er ... body. You
see this place has served its purpose. From information I have
received Mr. Standish was not the only person who had located my
little home as being in Switzerland. And even as near as that, my
dear fellow, is too near for my liking. So you will soon have the
place entirely to yourself."</p>

<p>"So you definitely mean to kill me," said Tiny quietly.</p>

<p>"For what other reason do you suppose I have gone to the trouble
and worry of bringing you out here," answered Zavier. "Had I had
the time I should have done it in London. But I didn't: things were
getting a little too hot. So it became necessary to devise some
other method, though I frankly admit I never dreamed it would come
off quite so successfully as it has. Well, au revoir, Mr. Carteret.
You made me run very fast at the Fifty-Nine Club, but I bear you no
ill-will."</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand he passed through a door which up till
then Tiny had not noticed. He left it ajar, and Tiny stared at the
aperture fascinated. It commanded the whole of his half of the
room, and it was through there, he felt certain, that death would
come. But how: in what form?</p>

<p>Suddenly an overmastering rage gripped him: he would not be
butchered like a rat in a trap. He went to the grille that blocked
the door, and hauled on it with all his great strength. Useless:
the thing was a fixture, and he cursed savagely. Then he pulled
himself together: there was no good losing his head. Surely
something could be done, but his only hope lay in keeping cool. His
eyes fell on the table. It was a big one with a stout top.
Supposing he was to use it as a shield. True&mdash;it wouldn't keep
out a bullet, but if Zavier had intended to shoot him surely he
would have done so already. He turned it on its end, and placed it
so that it shielded him from the aperture. Then getting the chair
he sat down and lit a cigarette. Now at any rate he only had one
opening to watch&mdash;the door in his half of the room.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged on: the silence seemed to grow more intense.
And after a time a very natural psychological reaction set in. He
fought against it, but it became stronger and stronger till he knew
that shortly he would be unable to resist it. What was happening on
the other side of the table in that part of the room he could not
see? The thought became a craving: he must know.</p>

<p>He stood up, and moved cautiously back from his shield, thereby
bringing more of the room into view. But there was still a large
area that was hidden: to see that he would have to put his head
round the table. After all, if it had to come, it had to&mdash;and
the sooner the better. He could not go on for the rest of time in
his present position. And he had just made up his mind to chance
it, when he heard a peculiar scratching noise. It came from the
other half of the room, and for a moment or two he listened
intently.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a grating sound, such as the leg of a chair
might make when moved slightly on a stone floor. And with a
pricking in his scalp Tiny realized that the crisis was at hand.
Somebody or something was in the room.</p>

<p>Cautiously he approached his table: to know what it was had now
become an imperative necessity. He would thrust his head out
quickly, and have a snap look. Then back again under cover to form
his plan. He did so, only to remain staring at what he saw.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," he remarked: then he began to laugh. Seated
on the back of the chair with its head cocked on one side was a
small monkey, solemnly waving a toy Swiss flag, and dressed in a
tiny coat.</p>

<p>"You funny little beast," he said. "Where in blazes have you
sprung from?"</p>

<p>Like most men of his type he adored animals, and the ridiculous
aspect of the situation struck him. There had he been sheltering
behind heavy barricades, and the foe turned out to be a diminutive
grey monkey!</p>

<p>"Come on, you little blighter," he cried, holding out his hand,
and suddenly it put the end of the flagpole in a pocket of the coat
so that its hands were free, ran down the chair and came sidling
across the floor towards him. It got through the grille with ease,
chattering hard. And he was on the point of stroking it when there
came a frenzied shout from behind him.</p>

<p>"Don't touch it. For God's sake&mdash;don't touch the monkey.
Kick it away."</p>

<p>And the voice was the voice of Ronald Standish.</p>

<p>Startled&mdash;the monkey paused, and as if in a dream Tiny
aimed a blow at it with his shoe. With a shrill squeak of anger it
scuttled away, back through the grille, and still half dazed with
the sudden development, Tiny saw that Zavier, his face suffused
with rage, had returned. And then things happened quickly: so
quickly that looking back on it later Tiny was hard put to it to
remember their exact order. The monkey darted to Zavier, who had
removed his monk's disguise, and swarmed up one of his legs. Then
it seemed to wave the flag. And the next instant Zavier was staring
at one of his hands, with terror in his eyes. On it was a long red
scratch.</p>

<p>"Come home to roost at last, Zavier, has it?" came Ronald's
quiet voice. "The reward is just."</p>

<p>Tiny forced himself to turn round. Standing in the doorway
behind the grille, in the garb of a monk, was the man he had
believed dead and buried.</p>

<p>And then from the other half of the room came a shout of
maddened rage.</p>

<p>"Behind the table, Tiny," roared Standish, and with a
splintering crash a bullet imbedded itself in the wood. Almost
simultaneously came a crack from the door, and a howl of pain from
Zavier, followed by the noise of his revolver falling on the stone
floor.</p>

<p>"If you bend to pick it up, Zavier, I'll plug your other hand,"
said Ronald quietly.</p>

<p>"For God's sake do," cried the other hoarsely, "before the
poison has time to work."</p>

<p>And Standish laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"As I said before&mdash;the reward is just," he said. "Ah! would
you?"</p>

<p>The two cracks rang out almost as one and then Ronald Standish
lowered his gun.</p>

<p>"You can come out, Tiny," he said quietly. "The swine has
cheated us after all."</p>

<p>And Tiny, stepping out from behind the table, understood. The
monkey was chattering angrily on the chair, and beside it lay
stretched the body of her master, a smoking revolver still clutched
in his hand. Zavier had blown out his brains.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">CHAPTER XII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"TOUCH and go, old lad," said Standish gravely. "I
can't think what maggot atrophied my brain."</p>

<p>"For the love of Pete, explain, Ronald," cried Tiny. "At the
moment my own is in the same condition."</p>

<p>They were back in the hotel at Brigue, and on the table between
them was the toy Swiss flag. At first sight it looked harmless
enough and the sort of thing to be expected on a birthday cake or a
Christmas tree. But a closer examination dispelled the illusion.
The little pole was about the length of an ordinary pencil, and
half the thickness. It was hollow and made of the finest steel, and
a small chain with a little band on the end&mdash;a band that was
fitted to the monkey's arm&mdash;ensured that it could never be
left behind.</p>

<p>A special grip like a tiny trigger guard had been made for the
monkey's paw an inch from the end, and this grip was connected by a
microscopic bar passing up the centre of the tube to a little
plunger, on exactly the same principle as a bicycle pump. A slot
rather more than two inches long allowed the grip to slide forward
that amount towards the sharp end, thereby ejecting any fluid on
the other side of the plunger. And at the sharp end there stuck out
for the sixteenth of an inch a needle point.</p>

<p>"Damned neat," said Standish, a note of genuine admiration in
his voice. "Look how beautifully the thing is made. It is nothing
more nor less than a perfectly disguised hypodermic syringe. Who
would ever suspect a monkey waving a flag? You'd merely think it
was an accidental scratch."</p>

<p>"He must have spent months training the little brute."</p>

<p>"Probably. Though those small ones pick up tricks very
quickly."</p>

<p>"I wonder what the poison is," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"They'll find that out at home fast enough," answered the other.
"Probably some native concoction, such as they use on their
poisoned darts."</p>

<p>He replaced it on the table and picked up a metal bar some three
feet long. One end was curved to make it look like a walking-stick,
but there the resemblance ceased.</p>

<p>"Exhibit Number two for Gillson's museum. Pull on that end,
Tiny."</p>

<p>The thing was telescopic, each new length fitting inside the
previous one. Its full length when extended was five yards, and it
formed a bar quite sufficiently rigid to bear the weight of a
little monkey.</p>

<p>"To introduce the beast into a room he could not reach
otherwise," said Standish. "Ingenious: very. But I ought to have
spotted it, Tiny."</p>

<p>"I'm blowed if I see how," cried the other.</p>

<p>"Go back a bit, old boy. I admit we had nothing to go on over
Jebson: nor did we have anything that helped us over Demeroff. It
was when we came to Felton Blake&mdash;or rather Joe
Denver&mdash;that we weren't as clever as we ought to have been.
You see, I was right when I said that that was an accident, and
that he had meant to get us. Well, having got as far as that I
should have pursued it to the logical end. And I didn't. I actually
said to you, if you remember, that he had set the scene in Blake's
room, and I oughtn't to have been so dense. He merely left the
monkey in the room pending our arrival."</p>

<p>"Awkward for Blake," said Tiny.</p>

<p>"Why? He had a perfect alibi with Lady Mary if things had worked
out according to plan. It was leaving young Denver out of the
calculations that upset the whole arrangement."</p>

<p>"I still don't see why you should have suspected the
monkey."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is easy to be wise after the event," agreed Ronald.
"But that, combined with the affair at my flat..."</p>

<p>"Who was it who was killed?" interrupted Tiny.</p>

<p>"Poor Stanhope&mdash;my man," said Standish gravely. "I found
him dead when I got back that night. And I did some pretty quick
thinking, Tiny. It seemed fairly probable that in murdering Denver
they had got the wrong man: but when it came to Stanhope it was an
absolute certainty. So what did it mean? The window was open: the
light was on. Therefore if Zavier had been able to see into the
room he would have spotted at once that it wasn't me. The logical
conclusion therefore was that he couldn't see into the room,
otherwise he wouldn't have murdered poor inoffensive Stanhope.
Which carried me a further step forward: it wasn't necessary for
Zavier to see his victim. Therefore there was some agent at
work&mdash;not exactly a blind agent, but one that couldn't
discriminate. And it is then, I think, that I was not very clever.
I should have spotted it. What happened, of course, is easy to
reconstruct now. Zavier from the road outside saw the light, and
Stanhope's shadow. He assumed it was me and took a chance. He had
brought the monkey in case: he must have gone straight from the
Fifty-Nine to get it. He introduced the little brute by means of
this stick, and that was that..."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd known, old boy. Jove! it gave me a turn the next
day."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Tiny: but it had to be done. You had to be in ignorance.
Otherwise you wouldn't have acted normally. You see, I had no idea
what Zavier's next move was going to be."</p>

<p>"Did Gillson know?"</p>

<p>"Yes: he knew. It was a beastly job changing clothes with that
poor devil, and then burning him enough to make him unrecognizable,
but it had to be done. The stakes were too big to hesitate."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"Shadowed you, old boy, disguised as a London telephone
operative. And it was then that I read the note which got Lady Mary
over to Paris. At first, I confess, I was completely dumbfounded:
how had they come to make such a mistake? We now know: moreover,
now we can see that it was that one mistake which has enabled us to
pull the thing off. That&mdash;and your girl's priceless nerve. Had
that message been in your handwriting she would assuredly have rung
you up to confirm it. And then&mdash;no Paris: no dead Zavier: no
film. But by acting as she did, she has let us win.</p>

<p>"As soon as I read it I made a few changes in my rig, and rushed
down to Croydon. I found you had chartered a special plane, so I
took another and followed you. But I did what you didn't do&mdash;I
met the boat train at the Gare du Nord. Moreover, I had previously
wired, and I had two of the best men in Paris with me. I saw Lady
Mary get into a big car, and tipped them the wink. They followed
her, and I came straight to the Majestic."</p>

<p>"I never saw you."</p>

<p>"You weren't intended to, Tiny," laughed the other. "I realized,
of course, that the thing must be coming to a head. She was in
Paris: you were at the Majestic: there would not be a moment's
unnecessary delay. What I thought was going to happen was the
receipt by you of a note from her&mdash;probably bogus&mdash;giving
some specious reason why you should go to a certain spot. And I
thought it more than likely that spot would be in Paris or just
outside.</p>

<p>"Candidly, I felt no anxiety over her. She was under the
immediate eye of the police, and even without that there was not
the faintest object in doing her any harm. From Zavier's point of
view she had served her purpose by getting you over, and he was far
too clever a man to commit an unnecessary crime. You were his bird,
and to come back to Gillson's metaphor I expected the arrival of
the tiger at any moment. He arrived, or rather his emissary did, in
the person of a very dear old friend of mine&mdash;one Perky
Edwards.</p>

<p>"Perky is probably the finest pen-and-ink draughtsman alive
to-day, but unfortunately for himself the medium he prefers is not
acceptable to the powers that be. The police have a rooted
objection to dud fivers, and as a matter of fact I didn't know
Perky was out of prison till I saw him soaking you good and hearty
in the bar."</p>

<p>"I thought the little swab was a bank clerk," laughed Tiny. "He
told me he was."</p>

<p>"He looks rather like it, doesn't he? Well, clearly, the last
round had begun. I didn't dare go into the bar myself&mdash;the
place was so empty&mdash;but I'd made all the necessary
arrangements. A man was outside the door to note any address you
gave to a taxi driver: I was there in case you consulted the
concierge. Which you did, and I must confess surprised me
considerably. I had not expected Brigue to be your
destination."</p>

<p>"But, good Lord!" cried Tiny, "you weren't that damned Frenchman
with a beard, were you?"</p>

<p>"Guilty, old boy," laughed the other. "And your distaste for
sharing a sleeper with me came as no surprise. However, if you were
going to Brigue, obviously I'd have to go too. Whether they were
going to try and do you in in the train, remained to be seen.
Anyway I got into the next compartment."</p>

<p>"I know you did," said Tiny with a grin. "And to start with I
thought you were Zavier himself."</p>

<p>"Now you've got to remember that I had no idea what particular
yarn Perky had put across you," went on Standish. "But what I did
know was that you were sitting in a position of considerable
danger. So I went to ground in that hotel opposite and during the
two hours you were here I had this veranda covered the whole time.
Then the monk arrived, and with him came the first flood of
light.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you didn't spot it: you had no suspicion then of
any trap. Whereas I knew the entire thing was a plant. I saw, at
once, the significance of that heap of torn-up cloth we found at
the Fifty-Nine, and the cord on the other side of the door. And so,
later on, Zavier's remarks to you came as no surprise. Ingenious,
you know, Tiny: he was perfectly right. It is the easiest of all
disguises to assume and the least suspicious.</p>

<p>"You have probably guessed by now that it was I in the car
following you, and so you have got most of the rest. As soon as you
had gone into the so-called monastery I knocked in the same way,
and though he was a bit suspicious at first he let me in. And then
it was a question of move, and move quickly. I went for him, but
before I outed him he gave tongue once."</p>

<p>"I heard him," said Tiny. "Just before the grille over the door
shut."</p>

<p>"I put on his rig, and all through your interview with Zavier I
was just outside in the passage. Perhaps it was an unfair risk to
expose you to, but I was so desperately keen to find out his
secret. Then he left, and you very wisely went to ground behind the
table. Now from where I was I could watch the door by which he had
left, and I saw that darned little monkey come in. And still my
brain didn't click. Which is why I said, Tiny, it was touch and go.
Gad! I'd never have forgiven myself if he had got you."</p>

<p>"What did make it click at the end?" said Tiny curiously.</p>

<p>"For some unaccountable reason there flashed through my mind the
last word that man Demeroff had said in the sleeper. You remember
you told me he called out what sounded like 'Bazana.' And it
suddenly dawned on me. What he had really shouted was 'Obezïana,'
which is the Russian for monkey. Whether in his half-drunken stupor
he had seen the little brute come through the window at Laroche, or
whether he knew Zavier's secret before, we shall never know. In
view of his determination to have the window shut I should think
the latter."</p>

<p>He got up and stretched himself, and a look of surprise dawned
on his face.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, if it isn't Lady Mary herself."</p>

<p>Tiny sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Where? It is, by Jove! Mary, dear," he called out, "what under
the sun brings you here?"</p>

<p>She was in the street below, and turned at the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>"Tiny," she cried, "is it really you? My dear, I've been sick
with anxiety. And Mr. Standish there too!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not dead," he grinned. "Come right up and take a pew.
We've been having a topping time."</p>

<p>She came up the steps towards them.</p>

<p>"You see, I went off with that woman to a house on the outskirts
of Paris, where I had dinner. And after dinner she left me to go to
the telephone. I waited and waited and she never returned, so after
awhile I had a look round. My dear&mdash;the house was empty: there
wasn't a soul in it. So I left, and met two men outside, who spoke
to me. They were in the police, and I asked them what I should do.
Their advice was to go back to Paris, and one of them got me a
taxi. I drove straight to the Majestic, and found you'd come here.
What was the idea?"</p>

<p>"To keep you out of the way, Lady Mary, sufficiently long to
decoy Tiny here," said Standish. "Our friend the late Mr. Zavier
was no slouch."</p>

<p>"Late?" She stared at him incredulously, and he nodded.</p>

<p>"He died unpleasantly a couple of hours ago, and left you
this."</p>

<p>With a grave smile he produced the film from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," she said very low. "So we've won after
all."</p>

<p>"Thanks entirely to you," he answered. "If you hadn't
deliberately walked into the trap with your eyes open we shouldn't
have this. What shall I do with it?"</p>

<p>"Burn it," she cried. "Burn the beastly thing at once."</p>

<p>In silence they watched it flare up and sizzle away: then
Standish began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I've got an idea," he said. "It just breaks my heart to
disappoint Berendosi. Supposing you two posed in a similar
attitude, and we sent him the film of that."</p>

<p>"Men have died for less infamous suggestions," grinned Tiny.
"However, we have no objection to you joining us at lunch provided
you pay for it."</p>
