  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. A LORD OF MILLIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE night had come, and Marvyn Chase was a blaze of light.
  The magnificent grounds gleamed with electric arc and other lamps, there were
  brilliant alleys picked out in flame, two of the finest bands in the county
  discoursed soft music in the lovely June night.</p>

  <p>There were two other bands inside the house, for Graham Minter, South
  African millionaire, was doing the thing in style, to use his own expression.
  The long suites of oak-panelled rooms were thronged with guests, most of whom
  had come down for the occasion by special train, a mob of reporters and
  press-men generally had the run of the house.</p>

  <p>For this was <i>the</i> function of the season&mdash;the fancy dress
  <i>bal masqué</i> given by Mr. Graham and Lady Mary Minter. The thing had
  been puffed in the papers for weeks before, the grand old house built by the
  dead and gone Marvyns pictured and photographed over and over again.</p>

  <p>Everybody knew now that Graham Minter had gone steerage to Cape Town ten
  years ago, and that he had come back eighteen months before a millionaire ten
  times over.</p>

  <p>He could have bathed in diamonds had he chosen. He was into everything.
  The last inter-state war in South America could never have been brought to an
  issue had he not financed one or the other of the combatants. That he was
  utterly unscrupulous did not in the least matter. He was very rich and
  hospitable, he had married the daughter of a marquis, and his entertainments
  were Arabian Nights up-to-date.</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful function, this <i>bal masqué</i>. Money had been
  lavished on it like water. The finest bands in Europe were here, the electric
  lighting had cost a small fortune, the supper had been imported from Paris
  with one of the most famous <i>chefs</i> in charge.</p>

  <p>The great function was at its height. Gorgeous figures flitted here and
  there, the air was heavy with the scent of perfume, the electrics shimmered
  on a perfect atmosphere of diamonds. The gardens of Bendemeer might have been
  stripped to provide all those roses there. There were banks of soft green
  ferns to rest the tired and jaded eye. Quite two hundred couples were
  waltzing in the big oak hall. Their fancy costumes made a flashing
  kaleidoscope of colour.</p>

  <p>The solitary individual who wore no disguise at all was the master of the
  house. He was a short, thick-set, clean-shaven man, with a certain bull-dog
  expression. His evening-dress was quite plain and not in the least loud. He
  might have been a sporting farmer, and indeed his tastes were in that
  direction. Hard as Graham Minter was with men, he was fond of dogs and
  horses, and they were fond of him. He could ride and shoot to perfection. His
  pink face and bloodshot eyes suggested an over indulgence in good living. But
  Minter boasted that he could live with the fastest and wake the next day with
  a head as clear as a bell.</p>

  <p>There was a slight frown on the bulldog face and a close-setting of the
  heavy lips. He seemed to be looking for somebody. He liked to see in the
  papers that this and that distinguished aristocrat had dined with him, but he
  cared nothing for all the lavish display and frivolity That was Lady Mary's
  doing. It mattered nothing to him that he did not know half his guests by
  sight. They would have ignored him utterly if they had known him. They came
  there, they sponged on him, some of them fawned upon him for advice, but he
  knew what they really thought.</p>

  <p>A graceful-looking woman, whose foolish, pretty face was exposed for a
  moment, flitted by. Minter shot out a hand and detained her with a grip that
  made her wince. The pretty face grew tearful. Lady Mary Minter was not
  overdone in the way of brains, she had married her husband because it suited
  his purpose to have a patrician wife to rule over his great <i>ménage,</i>
  but with his eyes open he knew that he was going to ally himself with a
  fool.</p>

  <p>"Graham, you hurt me," Lady Mary whispered.</p>

  <p>"Then stop a bit," Minter growled. "Let those brainless butterflies, those
  shallow sponges look after them selves for a moment. I asked you to do
  something for me."</p>

  <p>"Did you, Graham? I had forgotten."</p>

  <p>Minter's eyes flashed with a murderous light. He came from the class where
  men beat their wives. Lady Mary fell back whimpering.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten," she said. "But indeed I did what you asked. Mr.
  Desborough said he could stay till midnight. And Maude Beaumont remains to
  sleep. Indeed, I am not so foolish as you think me, Graham."</p>

  <p>"Ain't ye?" Minter sneered. "Keep those two together. Desborough won't go
  so long as Maude is kind to him. And make Kit Clive useful. How is Desborough
  dressed?"</p>

  <p>"As a lawmaker of the early Venice period&mdash;like a Doge, in fact."</p>

  <p>"That will do. Don't you leave him till I tell you, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced at her as he would have done at a badly-broken spaniel, his
  hand uplifted slightly; a less silly woman than Lady Mary would have been
  frightened.</p>

  <p>He passed out of the great hall into a wide, dimly-lighted corridor, where
  couples who were not dancing were seated.</p>

  <p>Nobody took the slightest notice of him, indeed he might have been one of
  the servants for all most of them knew or cared.</p>

  <p>It was darker still at the end of the corridor. A figure dressed as a monk
  crept out of the shadows and whispered something in Minter's ear. He flushed
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got a cheek," he growled. "You're useful to me in the City,
  but I'll wring your neck rather than ask you to my house, Bigglestone."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said the other coolly. "I'm not here as a guest. And
  there are one or two City men that you would not like to be seen talking to.
  The thing was imperative, so I adopted this disguise, and here I am."</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong up yonder?" Minter asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should say so. Suppose they put Eli Price in the witness-box
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Minter's square jaw dropped. But the murderous expression deepened in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say they've spotted him amongst the other guests of His
  Majesty at Dartmoor?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Well, if they have and he tells the truth when the case is called on
  to-morrow, I'm done. That big South African business collapses and I shall be
  a beggar. Jove, if some of my <i>friends</i> here only knew this!"</p>

  <p>"It's quite true," Bigglestone went on. "If only Clifford Desborough
  wasn't the leading barrister on the other side it wouldn't matter. But seeing
  that he was the leader in the Crown against Bartlett he knows too much."</p>

  <p>"Can't we manage to keep Eli Price away?" Minter suggested.</p>

  <p>"It could be done for money." Bigglestone smiled meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Then let it be done. Money is no object now. To prevent that I am
  prepared to pour it out like water. Bigglestone, you've got a scheme?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have," Bigglestone chuckled. "You find the money and I'll not
  shirk the rest, seeing that it's going to put £20,000 in my pocket. But I've
  got a better idea up my sleeve."</p>

  <p>"Well, out with it, man. None of your melodramatic mystery with me."</p>

  <p>Bigglestone looked cautiously around him. Nobody was within earshot.</p>

  <p>"The thing is quite easy," he said. "Square Desborough."</p>

  <p>"Of all the fools!" Minter snarled contemptuously. "There isn't a
  harder-headed man at the bar than Clifford Desborough. I don't say he's
  particularly honest, but he knows which policy pays best. I admit that he is
  poor."</p>

  <p>"And pretty considerably in debt," Bigglestone said meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Granted. But lie has a safe seat in the House of Commons and he's certain
  to be made Home Secretary when Clifton resigns, as he may at any moment. And
  he has made up his mind to marry Maude Beaumont who has a large fortune. You
  might as well try to square the Premier."</p>

  <p>Bigglestone winked knowingly. He believed in the integrity of no man. From
  his point of view it was only a matter of price. He led the way to a secluded
  seat amidst the palms and produced a bundle of long narrow strips of blue
  paper from his pocket. The papers had red stamps in the top left-hand
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly look at these?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Minter surveyed them rapidly. As he did so the bulldog jaw was thrust out,
  there was a hard smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>"I'll try it," he said, "dashed if I don't. I'll buy these of you."</p>

  <p>"You shall," Bigglestone said hoarsely, "at their full value. Squeeze him,
  ruin him, let him know the tale you could tell his rigid, Puritan
  constituents. Look there. Who's that?"</p>

  <p>A tall figure in severe Venetian garb came along with a dainty little
  "Beatrice" on his arm. Both watchers recognized the figure of the man. Then,
  with a meaning glance, Bigglestone turned and vanished.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. MAUDE BEAUMONT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE pretty little Beatrice clung somewhat unsteadily to the
  arm of her companion. She was just a trifle frightened that he had recognized
  her a little earlier in the evening, because the man of law had followed her
  pretty steadily of late.</p>

  <p>Of all the pretty girls out that season none had attracted more attention
  than Maude Beaumont. To begin with, she had no dragon to protect her, nothing
  more than an invalid mother, who rarely went out into Society. Maude had
  health and beauty, moreover she was just one and twenty, and her large
  fortune was absolutely at her disposal.</p>

  <p>She had her own gentle but effectual way of getting rid of the many lovers
  who had cast themselves at her feet. But there were two that she could not
  shake off&mdash;that eminent barrister and member of Parliament, Clifford
  Desborough, and Mr. Minter's private secretary, Christopher, otherwise Kit
  Clive.</p>

  <p>Kit was all right, a handsome, clever fellow, with a clear eye and an
  honest face, so honest that Maude wondered why he had remained two years with
  Minter. For Maude was the one particular friend of Lady Mary Minter, and her
  opportunities for meeting with the handsome private secretary were many.</p>

  <p>But Clifford Desborough, K.C., followed her up with a pertinacity that
  frightened her. He had let her know pretty well that he intended to marry
  her, and he belonged to the class of men who generally get their own way.</p>

  <p>In his own way, the keen man of law admired Maude; indeed, he loved her so
  far as he could love anything outside his ambition. Maude had money and
  birth; with a rich wife Desborough might have become Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>To-night he had determined to settle his fate one way or another. He had
  allowed Maude to know that from his manner. She was glad that her face was
  masked. He had asked her to come outside in the corridor with him and against
  herself she had complied. It was weak of her, but there was a certain
  fascination about this man. Maude would have turned back, but it was too late
  now.</p>

  <p>Was there nobody at hand to deliver her? Yes? Her heart throbbed hopefully
  as Minter rose from a seat close by and barred their further progress. With
  characteristic bluntness Minter went to the point.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry to trouble you, Desborough," he said. "And you, too, Miss
  Beaumont. No use either of you trying to disguise yourselves from me. I've
  got a most important message for you, Desborough. If Miss Beaumont will
  excuse me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't mind me!" Maude said hastily. "I can wait!"</p>

  <p>She scudded hurriedly away, so hurriedly that she ran almost into the arms
  of a man dressed in the period of Charles of pious memory.</p>

  <p>"Well, if the gods are not good to me to-night!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clive?" said Maude. "But how did you know me?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary gave you away," said Chris coolly. "Knowing that she could
  never keep a secret, I got a description of your dress from her. Isn't it
  hot? Let us go down and sit at the end of the corridor. There's a little
  place there known only to myself."</p>

  <p>In his breezy, cheerful way he slipped Maude's arm through his own. He did
  not fail to note that she was trembling violently. The little alcove was cool
  and secluded. Clive took off his mask, and Maude did the same. Afar off the
  band was playing, there was a splash of water somewhere near. The colour
  gradually came back to Maude's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"What has been frightening you?" Clive asked.</p>

  <p>He looked down tenderly into his companion's face There was a strong,
  manly air about him that appealed to the girl. He was so different from the
  rest, he never followed her, he never deferred his opinion to hers, and the
  admiration of his eyes was honest and sincere.</p>

  <p>"I have had a narrow escape," she said, with an unsteady smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! Somebody been trying to run away with you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite that," Maude said, as she fanned herself slowly. "Mr.
  Clive, have you ever been in love in your life?"</p>

  <p>"I have had the fever at times," Chris said. "But not sincerely till
  lately. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, because&mdash;well, I don't know. I have always been afraid of being
  married for my money. It would be such a horrible thing, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh! So you are uncertain as to whether a certain gentleman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude nodded. Clive's sunny face looked a little grave.</p>

  <p>"If you happen to care for him," he began, "why then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I don't, I am sure that I don't. He fascinates me. When I am with him
  I feel that I am bound to do just as he tells me. And at the same time I know
  perfectly well that he cares for nothing else but his ambition. He wants
  money to push him on in the world."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded. He began to understand.</p>

  <p>"That description applies to Clifford Desborough," he said.</p>

  <p>"How clever you are," Maude cried. "Sometimes I think I like him, and
  sometimes he frightens me. It would be a grand thing to be wife of a cabinet
  minister, but to think he only married you as a kind of ornament to his
  office! To think that one might have a life like Lady Mary!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary is quite happy in her way," Clive said coolly. "So long as she
  has plenty of money and pretty toys to play with she is perfectly contented.
  But you are different. You are not married to a scoundrel like Minter."</p>

  <p>"And yet you remain his private secretary?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can't help it," Clive replied. "My father made his money in the
  city, but not quite in the same way that Minter does. When he died, he made
  it a <i>sine qua non</i> that I should spend five years in active business.
  Minter took me over, so to speak, from a man who died. A few weeks more, and
  I am free. No city for me after September. Still, the time has not been
  wasted."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not dependent on your work for your living?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a great deal more money than you," Clive said coolly, "so you
  need not look upon me with a suspicious eye at any rate. But I'm going to
  show you a means of getting rid of Desborough's attention."</p>

  <p>Maude's face flushed, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"If you only would," she said eagerly. "If you only knew how he frightens
  and fascinates me. And he is hard and unfeeling."</p>

  <p>Maude's hands went out to her companion impulsively. He caught them and
  held them in his strong grip and grasp that thrilled her. Then he drew her
  close to him, so that he could look down into her beautiful, troubled
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Marry me, darling," he whispered. "Maude, I have known you for a year or
  more now. During that time we have been good friends. And the longer I have
  known you the greater is my love for you. Fortunately there is nothing to be
  said against me on the score of my position. As a poor secretary I could not
  have spoken. And I have always felt that you liked me, Maude. If you can come
  to love me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and looked into the rosy, flushed face. There was a smile on
  the girl's lips, and something like tears in her eyes. A light broke in upon
  Clive.</p>

  <p>"Maude," he whispered. "Maude, do you care for me a little bit?"</p>

  <p>She slipped her arms about his neck. There was happiness in her eyes
  now.</p>

  <p>"I love you," she said. "I loved you all the time, and I never knew it. It
  was only when you spoke that a veil seemed to fall away, and I could read my
  own heart clearly. But I never thought that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, other people did," Clive said joyously. "Foolish as she is, Lady
  Mary knows. In spite of her follies and extravagances, she is a good woman at
  heart, and nobody will be more pleased. And to think that you did not
  know!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I did," Maude said shyly. "And so my troubles are ended. I was
  terribly afraid that I should have to marry Mr. Desborough."</p>

  <p>"Nobody but me," whispered Clive as he gathered her his arms. "I shall
  take an opportunity of letting Mr. Desborough know of the little arrangement
  to-night, and there will be an end of him so far as we are concerned."</p>

  <p>Maude lay back on her lover's shoulder with a little sigh of relief. It
  was all so sweet and so fair, and so different from what she had expected.
  And to think that she had loved Kit Clive all this time without being in the
  least aware of the fact! It was a long time before they returned to the
  ball-room. Most of the guests were unmasked as supper had been announced.
  Clifford Desborough was standing by the door as if anxiously looking for
  somebody. His face was white and set, his eyes were glittering with a steady,
  gleaming fire.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for you everywhere," he said to Maude. His voice was
  hoarse and hard.</p>

  <p>"We've been away on business," said Clive cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Congratulate me. We shall want your advice later on over the marriage
  settlements."</p>

  <p>Desborough bowed and smiled mechanically. He bent his face low to hide its
  sudden pallor.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" he muttered. "<i>That</i> cord snapped too! When is it
  going to end?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. WHEN SILENCE IS GOLDEN</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Minter had stopped Maude and Clifford Desborough, the
  latter seemed to resent the intrusion of his host. He had taken Maude aside
  to put his fortune to the test. Ambitious, pushing, clever, absolutely
  certain of cabinet rank, there was one thing which the lawyer required, and
  that was a wife with plenty of money.</p>

  <p>How necessary this was, he alone knew. The man was desperately in need of
  money. He stood on the narrow edge of ruin, it needed but a touch to send him
  either way. He might yet attain dizzy heights; on the other hand, if
  bankruptcy overtook him his political career was ended.</p>

  <p>Therefore he kept his temper. It does not do to quarrel with millionaires
  who seem to require one's services urgently. Perhaps here there was a chance
  to lay hands upon the cash that Desborough so sorely needed.</p>

  <p>He looked around him hurriedly. He was about to say something to Maude
  Beaumont, but she had already slipped away. He saw her stopped by a masked
  figure that he recognized as Kit Clive, and something like an oath rose to
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"If the matter is urgent," he said, "why&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more urgent under the sun," said Minter. "Come along! What do you
  and I care for all this tomfoolery?"</p>

  <p>Desborough forced a laugh. The money wasted here to-night would have made
  him a free man, and absolutely assured his future. A feeling of envy assailed
  him as he looked at the flowers and the pictures, and caught the distant
  flood of melody. A single word from Minter would have put him right. He
  wondered if his host was aware how desperate were his circumstances.</p>

  <p>"We all like to relax at times," he said. "Lead the way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Minter turned into a little room at the end of the corridor that chanced
  to be empty. He locked the door, and signified to Desborough to lay aside his
  mask. The latter accepted the proffered cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me for?" Desborough asked.</p>

  <p>Minter looked him straight in the face. There was a fighting gleam in his
  eyes, a hard expression on the bulldog mouth.</p>

  <p>"I'll come to the point at once," he said. "I'm not one of those men who
  waste a lot of valuable time on what they call diplomacy. You have a big case
  coming on tomorrow&mdash;Mackness against the Certified Company. As you are
  aware, I am practically the company."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Desborough. "And you are going to lose. Will that
  make any great difference to you?"</p>

  <p>Minter's great jaw came out with an ugly sweep.</p>

  <p>"All the difference," he said hoarsely. "Connect us with those smuggled
  arms and we forfeit our trading rights with all the South American States you
  know of. I've got every penny I can scrape together wrapped up in that
  business. If we fail now, down goes the whole house of cards."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear that," Desborough said politely. "Your connexion with
  those smuggled arms is not on the face of my instructions, but I am going to
  prove it out of the mouth of one of your witnesses&mdash;Ericsson."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is as I suspected! Now, listen to me. If you made it easy for
  Ericsson your clients would be none the wiser. It would be at worst no more
  than an error of judgment on your part. Nobody could blame you."</p>

  <p>"The mere suggestion is absurd," Desborough said coldly. "People might say
  I had made a mistake, that is all&mdash;as you say, a mere error of judgment.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are going to commit that error of judgment."</p>

  <p>The words came out with a hoarse growl from Minter's lips. There was no
  suggestion of compromise about him, no gilding of the pill. He was commanding
  Desborough to betray his client's case, and abandon his own honour.
  Desborough stepped forward, thrilled to the finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"I am going to sell my brief!" he gasped. "You scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>Minter smiled. He was not in the least moved.</p>

  <p>"Hard words break no bones!" he said. "I'm in a hole, my friend, an
  infernally deep hole. And you are in the same place. You get out on my
  shoulders, and then you pull me up afterwards. Or we are both ruined."</p>

  <p>"And why should I do this?" Desborough sneered.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, drop it," Minter said impatiently. "I've got you on the hip. For
  months you have been dealing with the money-lenders. You are hopelessly
  ruined. All those documents you have signed&mdash;those little
  bills&mdash;are in my hands. See."</p>

  <p>He held out the long slips of blue paper that Bigglestone had given him.
  He slapped the pile with a vicious hand.</p>

  <p>"See here&mdash;and here," he cried, "your signatures to all of them. I
  bought them up as a speculation. They are mine, you understand. Fourteen
  thousand pounds' worth, and every penny overdue. My future Home Secretary,
  you are in my hands. I can make your fortune or I can make you bankrupt on
  Monday morning."</p>

  <p>Desborough staggered back. The full force of it utterly overcame him.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens," he said hoarsely. "I can't find as many shillings, man;
  have you no feeling, no sense of honour?"</p>

  <p>His face was pale, the beads were running down his forehead. Minter thrust
  the suggestion aside with hard contempt.</p>

  <p>"Don't prate to me," he said. "What are you trying to do? To catch a girl
  you care nothing about for the sake of her money. And you are right because
  money is everything, and truth and honour mere empty sounds. The people who
  come here sneer at me, but they would black my boots for a scrap of early
  information. I could walk on a carpet of coronets if I liked."</p>

  <p>Desborough paced backwards and forwards. He was like a rat caught in a
  trap. He knew this man would have no more mercy on him than a terrier with
  the rat aforesaid. The steady eye and the cruel jaw showed that.</p>

  <p>"Well, get on," Minter said impatiently. "You are perfectly safe. You said
  just now that the omission of a few questions would not be deemed anything
  more than an error of judgment. It would make no difference to you. It would
  leave me as I stand instead of stripping me of everything."</p>

  <p>"I am thinking," Desborough said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Then let me think for you," Minter replied with an oath. "Think of the
  place that you have so fairly won filled by another. Think of your smug
  constituency holding up their hands in horror at the news that their
  respected member has lost over five thousand pounds on the turf. A bankrupt!
  After that there would be no fresh start, no whitewashing for you. The people
  I mention are the backbone of your following: oily Pharisees, who may yet
  force you on to the Premiership. Think of the honour and glory that lies
  before you, all for a few minutes of discreet silence. Think&mdash;but I am
  wasting time. Why parley with me, why juggle with what you call a conscience?
  You have made up your mind already."</p>

  <p>"If you gave me time."</p>

  <p>"Not an hour, not a moment," cried Minter instantly, following up his
  advantage. "You can't find the money to pay me off. It is only when a man
  starts to borrow that he discovers how lonely he is. Do you accept my terms
  or not?"</p>

  <p>Minter put the question in a hoarse whisper. He bent forward, with his
  eyes almost glaring into those of his unhappy victim. There was no disguise
  about him. He was proposing a vile and dishonourable course, and he took no
  shame in it.</p>

  <p>And the worst of it was, Desborough was perfectly safe. Nobody would find
  out what he was going to do.</p>

  <p>"I have only your word to rely on," he said feebly.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow these bills shall be passed over to you. As to my
  word&mdash;why, you have got to accept what I offer you."</p>

  <p>Desborough lunged out desperately at his tempter. In a sudden despairing
  fury he reached for the door, turned the key, and rushed down the corridor.
  All his emotion was absolutely lost on Minter. He followed a moment later
  until he came to the spot where he hoped to meet the disguised Bigglestone.
  The latter rose from behind a cluster of waving palms.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he asked breathlessly. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"Gone off in a fury," Minter chuckled. "But he didn't defy me, and I moved
  him as he has never been moved before."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't come to any arrangement?"</p>

  <p>"Not definitely," Minter replied, with the same diabolical chuckle. "but
  for all that the thing is as good as done."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. A BRIEF RESPITE</h2>

  <p class="first">OF the darker side of human nature Minter was a perfect
  judge. He knew perfectly well that there was no need to press Desborough
  further. The man had only one vulnerable point, and that was his ambition. He
  was hard and keen and shrewd; from early manhood he had made up his mind to
  become a Cabinet Minister. And now he knew perfectly well that only one
  feeble life stood between himself and his goal.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately he had made too much haste to become rich. He knew the value
  of money, and he had longed for it. He had gambled and speculated, with the
  result that he was up to his ears in debt and difficulty; every month that he
  had struggled along only landed him deeper in the mire.</p>

  <p>And here was a way out of it. Minter had bought up all his bonds with a
  view to force him to betray the interests of his clients. And he could do so
  without anybody but Minter being any the wiser. Once that was done he would
  be free from debt. His ordinary trade creditors did not trouble him in the
  least. To a man making his income at the Bar they mattered little. He might
  have made more money still by his profession had he not been so keen on
  politics.</p>

  <p>All this passed through Desborough's mind as he tossed and turned on a
  sleepless pillow. He did not debate the matter at all; in his heart of hearts
  he felt quite certain that he should do exactly what Minter requested.
  Otherwise he might just as well end it all by a leap from Waterloo
  Bridge.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of all these conflicting thoughts on Desborough's face
  as he came down to the Law Courts presently. He was perfectly master of
  himself now. As he turned into the building he came face to face with Minter.
  The short, thick-set figure of the millionaire was clad in tweeds; he had a
  soft felt hat on his head. He came forward and shook hands as if he and
  Desborough had parted the best of friends.</p>

  <p>"Got anything important on?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very striking," Desborough said grimly. "A little case where you
  are more or less interested&mdash;at least you may be interested later
  on."</p>

  <p>"Only indirectly," said Minter indifferently. "Can't always be answerable
  for the folly of one's servants, you know. By the way, have you heard the
  news? My secretary Clive is engaged to Miss Beaumont."</p>

  <p>Desborough took the blow smilingly. He had been forewarned.</p>

  <p>"So Clive told me last night," he said. "A good thing for him. There will
  be a run on millionaire secretaryships by penniless men about town after
  this."</p>

  <p>"Clive has more money than Miss Beaumont," said Minter. "He merely took up
  city work under the terms of his father's will. So long!"</p>

  <p>The men drifted apart. Minter's parasite Bigglestone came gliding up, a
  small, lithe man with a crafty face.</p>

  <p>"That looked all right," he said meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I said it would be," Minter replied. "He'll do it, or
  rather, he will leave it undone. Otherwise he would never have talked to me
  in that friendly manner. The last prop is cut away, too. He hoped to marry
  Miss Beaumont. If he could have got her consent last night he would have
  snapped his fingers at me. As it is, my secretary very kindly took the job
  from off my hands. Your interests in our little venture are quite safe,
  Bigglestone."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that Price is to be called," Bigglestone whispered. "Price
  feels that he has been a victim. He thinks that if we had played him up
  fairly he would never have landed in Portland. He only comes to verify a
  signature to one of the many documents in the case, but he might get a chance
  of telling a tale or two."</p>

  <p>Minter's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"I gave you a free hand," he said. "I told you not to spare money. You
  intimated last night that you had a scheme to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And so I have. Once let me get the ear of Price and I'll soon square
  <i>him</i>. But it is Ericsson that I am afraid of."</p>

  <p>"I tell you that Desborough does not ask any dangerous questions."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. But Ericsson is one of the greatest cowards in the world. He
  has been drinking a great deal lately to steady his nerves. As a matter of
  fact, he has knocked his nervous system all to pieces. For two days I have
  kept him well in hand, with the result that I had to give him brandy to-day
  to make anything like a man of him at all."</p>

  <p>Minter's deep brows came together in a heavy frown. He was playing
  desperately for a heavy stake, and his path was strewn with thorns. It was
  just possible that one of his own tools might cut him, but if he could see
  today well over, he did not care for the future. He passed into court with a
  jaunty air, but his heart was beating a little faster than usual. It rested
  entirely on Desborough whether the case took a sensational turn or not; on
  the broad issue Minter did not mind whether he got a verdict or not.</p>

  <p>For some time the case proceeded smoothly. Presently the Crown counsel
  announced his intention of calling a witness. The usher took up the cry, and
  the name of Ericsson resounded far and near.</p>

  <p>The man came at length, white and shaking, with a lip that trembled and a
  hand that grasped the edge of the witness box like a drowning sailor. He
  seemed to be terribly frightened about something.</p>

  <p>Yet he gave his evidence fairly well. Evidently he had been carefully
  coached. Minter listened with his head well down. He had no desire to confuse
  the witness by meeting his shifty glance. Desborough was approaching the
  point where the fatal questions might or might not be put.</p>

  <p>"It's coming," Bigglestone whispered to his client.</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, fool," Minter muttered between his teeth. "Those
  questions are not going to be asked at all. Once that chap is out of the box
  we shall be safe. We are quite clear up to now."</p>

  <p>All the same the witness was getting confused. He could not remember
  anything. He was mixed up in his mind with a certain man called Price. If
  Price could say this or that he would be able to proceed. Minter listened,
  with the big veins in his forehead swelling with anger.</p>

  <p>"Who is this Price?" the judge asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Forthcoming witness, my lord," said Desborough, "whom I shall call."</p>

  <p>"Call him now," the Bench suggested. "Let this witness stand down."</p>

  <p>Desborough bowed. Price was on the lips of the usher. They called again,
  but there was no response. There was just a minute's pause when a messenger
  handed a telegram up to the solicitors' table. One of the attorneys there
  read it with a start, and then passed it on to Desborough. The few spectators
  in court thrilled with the expectation of a dramatic surprise. They were not
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"A most extraordinary thing has happened, my lord," Desborough said. "This
  is from Sergeant Farringdon, who was sent down with two constables to bring
  the man Price from Portland."</p>

  <p>"The man Price being a convict!" the judge said.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, my lord. It appears that the convict and the escort got safely
  as far as Clavering, where there is a stay of a few minutes. It is a small
  station, and there were few people about. Without any warning five or six men
  came from another carriage, overpowered and maltreated Farringdon and the
  constables, and drove off with the prisoner in a dog-cart. The sergeant adds
  that recapture is inevitable, but it may be a day or two before it takes
  place."</p>

  <p>A murmur of surprise followed this extraordinary statement. Minter sat
  with his face still hung down, but there was a look of fiendish satisfaction
  upon it. So far as he could see the situation was absolutely saved.</p>

  <p>"Was this your scheme?" he whispered to Bigglestone.</p>

  <p>"It was," the latter chuckled, "and a precious good one too, I flatter
  myself. A fiver apiece did the trick, with railway fare. You may be pretty
  sure that I shall see Price before the police get a chance. I wouldn't take
  £30,000 for my share in our little venture now."</p>

  <p>"A most astounding thing!" the Bench murmured. "Under the circumstances,
  what do you propose to do, Mr. Desborough?"</p>

  <p>"There is no alternative but to ask for an adjournment for a few days, my
  lord," said Desborough. "We cannot get on very well without the man Price,
  and we must give the police some little latitude. Say Monday?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. The case is adjourned till Monday. Call the next, please."</p>

  <p>Minter slipped out of the court, followed by Bigglestone. He was a strong
  man, but he did not disdain the brandy that he called for at the nearest bar.
  Desborough came out of court more slowly and thoughtfully. He felt that he
  had a reprieve. He had not abandoned honour yet. He still had a chance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. A VOICE FROM THE PAST</h2>

  <p class="first">BEING a bachelor, Clifford Desborough's <i>ménage</i> was
  not an expensive one. He had three rooms in the Temple, and where he had his
  consultations was at once his living and smoking room after office hours.</p>

  <p>To do the man justice, he was no sybarite. He had been busy all the
  afternoon and evening; he had swallowed an indifferently-cooked chop and some
  dubious claret, and now over a pipe he had turned to a mass of papers again.
  A big pile of invitations he had contemptuously swept upon the floor.</p>

  <p>The clerk came in with two or three leather-bound volumes under his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Here are what you want, sir," he said. "They are the diaries of the late
  Mr. James Beaumont, the gentleman who originally obtained the concessions
  that more or less formed the base of the Mackness-Minter litigation."</p>

  <p>Desborough looked up with an interested face.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you got those," he said. "A lucky find, Mellor."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, sir. Mr. Mackness found them after he bought Mr. Beaumont's
  practice. I have not ventured to investigate, but there are some private
  matters there that might as well be relegated to obscurity. In fact, Mr.
  Mackness' solicitor asked in the present action that they should be destroyed
  after you had made what use you like of them."</p>

  <p>Desborough nodded a dismissal and the discreet clerk disappeared. It was
  some little time before the barrister had occasion to refer to the diaries.
  He picked up the first volume and skimmed it over. There were points likely
  to be of use to him in the case, and these he duly noted. But there were
  other matters also that few men confide to a diary. It seemed odd to
  Desborough that he should be looking at the life of the man whose daughter he
  had hoped to marry.</p>

  <p>He read on, riveted by what was before his eyes. For the minute he had
  forgotten all about the case that these books led up to. He was reading
  sacred family secrets. Not that there was anything strange in this, seeing
  that lawyers and barristers lived in an atmosphere of this kind.</p>

  <p>He should have put the book down, he should have destroyed it. But he did
  nothing of the kind. He read on and on until the clock struck ten. Then he
  lighted a cigarette and lay back in a chair.</p>

  <p>His face was hard and set, there was a strange gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Here is a chance," he muttered, "the chance of a lifetime. Only to a
  member of the law could such a thing happen. Fate places Maude Beaumont's
  future in my hands. I have discovered a shameful family secret. If I could go
  to her and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, his mind working fast.</p>

  <p>"I can save myself by doing what Minter asks me," he went on, "but by so
  doing I place myself entirely in the fellow's power. Sooner or later he will
  give me another disgraceful task to do, sooner or later, he will drag me
  down. And in a few weeks I shall be a Cabinet Minister. If only I could have
  won Maude's consent to marry me, I could have defied him. With my prospects
  and the knowledge that I was engaged to a wealthy girl I could have raised a
  loan to clear me. As it is, Fortune has stepped in and saved me from
  dishonour&mdash;<i>as yet</i>. I have a few days now to wriggle out of
  Minter's net. Maude has promised to marry Clive, but I could break off that
  match."</p>

  <p>Desborough's face grew white and the gleam in his eyes deepened. He was
  contemplating a dastardly and dishonourable deed. Fate had placed a
  tremendous weapon in his hands. Should he throw it aside or should he use it?
  Anything to get out of Minter's clutches. He would have to proclaim himself a
  scoundrel to a girl he respected, who believed in him, but that did not
  matter.</p>

  <p>It was a horrible position to be placed in altogether. But to remain under
  the thumb of Minter was intolerable. Sooner or later that was bound to spell
  absolute ruin. He sat up and glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>Only a little past ten, and social London was just beginning to enjoy
  itself. Most of the dinners were over by this time and the receptions
  beginning. Where was Maude Beaumont most likely to be to-night? Lady Mary
  Minter had said that she was dining at Park Lane to-night and that she was
  going on to Mrs. Hackett-Smith's party afterwards. It was pretty certain that
  Miss Beaumont would be there also. And Mrs. Hackett-Smith had sent Desborough
  a card. Whether he had accepted or not made no difference, Mrs. Hackett-Smith
  was always ready to smile on successful men, and next week he might be Home
  Secretary.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and take the chance!" Desborough muttered.</p>

  <p>He passed into his bedroom and dressed quickly. The barrister was put
  aside for the moment. Half an hour later the polished, easy man of Society
  was bending over the hand of his hostess and talking smoothly of nothing in
  particular.</p>

  <p>He had to wait some little time. The rooms and the stairs were crowded.
  Desborough was preparing to get upon the track of his quarry by skilful
  questioning, when he caught the flash of Maude Beaumont's dress. She
  fluttered into a little alcove accompanied by Lady Mary Minter. A well-known
  Society journalist accompanied them.</p>

  <p>Desborough pushed his way into the alcove with a vague air of expecting to
  find nobody there. There was just room for four.</p>

  <p>"Here is a pleasant surprise," he said. "I was feeling like Robinson
  Crusoe. And four really is company. I'll take this seat, Lady Mary."</p>

  <p>"You look worked to death," Denton the journalist suggested. "Anything
  sensational? I envy you barristers. I have to depend for my copy a great deal
  on imagination, whereas you have always something real to go upon."</p>

  <p>"A barrister meets strange coincidences," Desborough said. "I met one
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Scandal!" Lady Mary cried. "Please, please go on. I'm bored to
  death!"</p>

  <p>"I'd far rather it was fiction," Maude observed. "Is it very
  interesting?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy you will find it so," Desborough replied. He had his voice
  perfectly under control, he spoke slowly and distinctly. "Probably I should
  not have mentioned it had Denton not been present. Anyway, here is a plot for
  a novel. We will say that I am a successful barrister with a great prize well
  within my grasp. I am young and ambitious, but, like most young and ambitious
  men, I am very poor. Not only am I very poor, but I am disgracefully in debt
  at the same time. My Oxford creditors nearly drove me mad. To try to pay them
  I speculated till I was in a worse plight than ever. There is a synopsis of
  the first act in a nutshell."</p>

  <p>"And a very good one, too," Denton murmured approvingly. "I am deeply
  interested."</p>

  <p>Maude looked curiously into the story-teller's face, but she could make
  nothing of it. All around her the chatter of the frivolous was going on, the
  outward seeming of absolute happiness rich Society always has, and yet she
  felt cold and uneasy. There seemed to be some meaning behind it all.</p>

  <p>"Act II," Desborough went on. "The man I speak of must be saved in some
  way. As I speak in a Society atmosphere let me give you a Society flavour to
  the story. The man seeks a rich wife. A prosaic way out of the difficulty,
  but a safe one. He finds his ideal, who is lovely and good and clever and
  very rich. But she has the bad taste to care for another&mdash;she is engaged
  to another, in fact. Most men would look further, but not my barrister,
  because he is in a position to find things out. In this case he does find
  things out. He is engaged in a certain case, and in his researches into that
  case he consults some diaries written by the late father of the girl he wants
  to make his wife. There fortune comes to the aid of the ambitious young man.
  In that diary is the story of a family secret. The young lady has a sister.
  Years ago that sister made a secret match with a man of dubious reputation.
  All this is told in the diary which was consulted merely for dry business
  purposes. The newly-married couple were in a shipwreck and their names were
  given amongst the missing. As a matter of fact they were not drowned.
  Moreover, they were not married, for the scoundrel of a man had a wife alive
  all the time. The mother of the poor girl was not told, she does not know to
  this day. If she did, it would kill her."</p>

  <p>Desborough paused as if for breath. He glanced at Maude, whose face was
  partly hidden by her fan. He could see that the face was white as marble, the
  fan rustled as if shaken by the wind. Desborough had learnt all he required.
  Maude had not heard this story for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Now we come to Act III," he went on quite gaily. "The other daughter
  knows the story. My pushing young barrister is going to make her his wife. He
  tells her that she must give up the other man and marry him. For the honour
  of the family she is compelled to sacrifice her own feelings. The scandal
  still remains secretly buried, and that man and that girl save one another.
  End of Act III."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Denton cried. "So far, a really gripping story. But what about
  the end of the play&mdash;the last act?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. FOR HER MOTHER'S SAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">"THAT is as far as I have gone," Desborough said. "Some
  papers I found to-day suggested the romance to me, and I amused myself by
  working it out as I came along. You can finish the story as you please. It is
  a matter of indifference to me whether that fellow repents or holds the girl
  in his power. But the class of man I have in my mind would never sacrifice
  his career."</p>

  <p>A band was playing somewhere near. The noisy chatter was going on. Maude
  lowered her fan. Her face was deadly pale, but there was a look of strange
  contempt not unmixed with pleading yearning in her eyes that was lost on all
  but Desborough.</p>

  <p>"Would your friend trade on a professional secret like that?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"You find the story convincing?" Desborough asked with a hard little
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Horribly convincing," Maude shuddered. "It seems strange that such
  scoundrels should be allowed to live. But really you have carried me away. I
  suppose it is because I am hot and tired. Take me somewhere and get me an
  ice."</p>

  <p>She flashed a challenge at Desborough for a moment. She was going to see
  this thing through without delay. Desborough offered his arm. His feelings
  were strongly mixed as he walked along. The task of telling a woman whom he
  honoured and admired that he was a scoundrel was accomplished.</p>

  <p>"Take me to the garden," Maude said. "It will be quiet there."</p>

  <p>They found a secluded spot at length, a shady seat under the swaying light
  of a Chinese lantern. Maude turned upon her companion instantly.</p>

  <p>"Now let us understand each other," she said, with heaving bosom. "I am
  not blind enough to think that you told your story for sheer amusement."</p>

  <p>"My dear Maude, nothing is further from my thoughts at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Miss Beaumont, if you please," Maude said coldly. "Well, for the present,
  if you like. But I beg your pardon. You were speaking. Go on."</p>

  <p>"I will. You are the needy, ambitious, outwardly successful barrister. At
  the present moment you stand between a shining career and utter collapse.
  Therefore, you must marry money. It all comes down to money in the end. If
  you want money, ten, twenty thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop," Desborough cried hoarsely. Even his nature was galled at last. "I
  cannot stoop to that. Strange as it may seem, I still have my pride. My mood
  is not to blackmail you. If you only knew how I respect and esteem
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He came a step nearer, but Maude recoiled with horror.</p>

  <p>"You fill me with contempt," she said. "How dare you pollute such words
  with your lips! You have a mother, a good woman."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> have a mother too, which brings us to the point."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are shameless! You have me in your power, you have it in your
  hands to cast a slur over a good and honourable name, to strike one of the
  sweetest, dearest women on earth to the heart. Of course the miserable girl
  you told of in your story was my sister. My father's diary came into your
  hands for business purposes, and you abuse their secrets like this! Unless I
  promise to become your wife, you will tell this shameful story."</p>

  <p>Desborough was silent for the moment. There was something in the pleasing
  scorn of the girl's voice that touched him. He was not quite so hard as he
  had imagined. But the thoughts of Minter and the gripping power of the man
  drove all feeling back. He was not going to stay his hand now.</p>

  <p>"I <i>must</i> do it," he said hoarsely. "I cannot sacrifice myself
  <i>now</i>. As your mother is to you, so is my ambition to me. I am
  Ambition's Slave. A day or two and I shall be a Cabinet Minister or a
  beggar."</p>

  <p>"A beggar or an honest man?" Maude cried.</p>

  <p>"You are merely wasting time," said Desborough impatiently. "I have told
  you everything. You have seen the strong man, you have witnessed his struggle
  for his darling sin."</p>

  <p>"And from the bottom of my heart I pity you."</p>

  <p>"Pity <i>me</i>! Why&mdash;why on earth should you pity me?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are an object of pity. What sadder spectacle than the sight
  of a man who for the first time proclaims himself a scoundrel?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you madden me," Desborough said, with a quick intake of his breath.
  "I should be a fool as well as a knave if I drew back now. You are going to
  marry me. With you by my side I would do anything."</p>

  <p>"And if I refused the distinguished honour that you would confer on
  me?"</p>

  <p>"You are not going to refuse. When you came out here this evening with me,
  you knew perfectly well what was the inevitable conclusion. You are going to
  save your mother&mdash;you are going to save me, you are going to save the
  situation all round."</p>

  <p>Maude drooped into her seat pale and trembling. There was a mist before
  her eyes, and in the centre of it Desborough loomed big and strong and
  merciless. And only last night she had been so happy. Besides, she had given
  her word to another, she had promised to become the wife of Kit Clive.</p>

  <p>But she could not go on with that now. She did not dare to think what Kit
  would say when she told him, as she must, that it was all over between them.
  Still, her mother must never know the shameful secret that had come so
  strangely into the possession of Clifford Desborough.</p>

  <p>She knew the man well, and how strong his ambitions were. He must indeed
  have been desperately placed to go so far as this. She looked into his eyes
  and saw not the slightest sign of relenting there. Hatred, contempt, scorn
  all alike were lost on him.</p>

  <p>"Why hesitate?" he said, "why wait? The thing is inevitable. Will you
  marry me&mdash;will you consent to be my wife, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. He took something shining from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"This was my mother's engagement ring," he said. "I brought it with me for
  a surprise. See, it fits like a glove, an omen for the future."</p>

  <p>A convulsive shudder shook Maude from head to foot. She could do no more
  than glance in a fascinated way at the shining hoop of diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Go away," she said. "Leave me, or I shall do something desperate. Be
  content with the knowledge that I&mdash;I shall marry you."</p>

  <p>The last two words were raised, they came as if dragged from the girl's
  lips. Desborough fought down the triumph that rose within him. It was not the
  moment to exult. He just touched the tips of Maude's chill fingers with his
  lips and was gone.</p>

  <p>He did not see Maude fling herself back in her seat, he did not see the
  tears that ran down her cheeks. He had no consciousness of the man who had
  come up in the last moment or two and who had remained outside the ring of
  light watching the little scene with dazed fascination.</p>

  <p>But the man came forward and laid his hand gently on Maude's shoulder. She
  did not look up, she cowered down as if something loathsome had touched
  her.</p>

  <p>"Go away," she said. "For Heaven's sake be satisfied with your work."</p>

  <p>"It is I, Maudie," said Clive. "I came to look for you. And I saw and
  heard things that pass my comprehension. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Maude looked up now, her face white and deathly.</p>

  <p>"This completes my humiliation," she whispered. "What did you hear,
  Kit?"</p>

  <p>"I heard you promise to marry Desborough. You are engaged tome. And yet
  all the time you hate and loathe him!"</p>

  <p>"Oh I do, I do. God knows that I do. Kit, you have trodden on the fringe
  of a strange and dreadful secret. I meant you to know nothing of this. I
  meant to have written to you a cold little note saying that our engagement
  was a mistake. My idea was to try and anger you, to make you feel that I was
  not worthy of an honest man's love. And now my misery is all the more
  profound."</p>

  <p>"But, my darling, I am sure you have done nothing wrong."</p>

  <p>"Not myself. But there are others. And you must not speak to me like that
  again, Kit, or I shall break down. It cuts me to the heart to tell you, but
  our engagement is at an end. I shall have to marry Mr. Desborough. Don't ask
  me why, don't press me to tell how, because I cannot. I <i>dare not</i> tell
  you. If you only knew, from the bottom of your heart you would pity me."</p>

  <p>Kit made no reply. For a long time he was strangely silent. Maude looked
  up, her eyes red with tears.</p>

  <p>"Say you are not angry with me!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I am not angry with you at all," Clive said. "I am wounded sorely, but I
  have no feeling against you. My darling, I am going to get to the bottom of
  the thing. I am going to save you from a scoundrel. There is time to do so
  yet, time to set you free. If you say that you no longer love me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A broken cry came from Maude's lips.</p>

  <p>"Never," she said. "Never, I shall love you to the end of my life."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. LOVE OR HONOUR?</h2>

  <p class="first">CLIVE said nothing for the moment. It was a hard fight to
  keep his emotions in hand, but he conquered. He could not look into that
  beautiful face and clear, truthful eyes and feel that Maude had played him
  deliberately false. Her whole line of conduct forbade the traitorous thought,
  the attitude, the attitude of utter despair.</p>

  <p>She gave him a wild, imploring glance.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you leave me?" she asked. "Say something hard and unkind to me.
  Go away and forget me altogether."</p>

  <p>But Clive did not move. His heart was full of an infinite pity for Maude.
  She would never have done this had there not been some stern necessity for
  her conduct.</p>

  <p>"Presently," he said. "I am not blaming you, Maude; I shall never do that.
  Some deep tragedy has come into your life, you are taking this course for the
  sake of another. But surely when you come quietly to consider your own
  happiness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Henceforth happiness and I are strangers," she said. "I have done this
  thing deliberately. I <i>must</i> do it. And yet not one word of reproach
  comes from you!"</p>

  <p>"Because I love you," Kit said quietly. "I shall never care for another
  woman so long as I live. And you love me&mdash;nothing can rob me of that
  confession. Won't you tell me your secret?"</p>

  <p>"The secret is not my own to tell."</p>

  <p>"But I might show you some way. If disgrace touches you."</p>

  <p>"It does. Not so much myself as another. Oh, I know you would not mind,
  and you are too noble and generous for that. But nothing could make any
  difference now."</p>

  <p>Maude spoke from the depths of her despair. She could not meet Kit's eyes
  again.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said at length. "I will press you no further. But I shall
  get to the bottom of the thing. I will leave no stone unturned. For the
  present we will meet as friends only. Good-night, my darling, and God bless
  you."</p>

  <p>He touched Maude's forehead lightly with his lips and was gone. In the
  inner room he could hear the full measured tones of Clifford Desborough's
  voice. There was a quiet ring of triumph and pride in the voice, never had
  Desborough looked quite so strong and powerful. He crossed over to Clive and
  held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"It was all a mistake," he said. "You must not blame Miss
  Beaumont&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the whole we had better not shake hands," Kit replied. "As to Miss
  Beaumont, you need not be under any misapprehension; I don't blame her in the
  least. By what vile means you have contrived to come between a woman and the
  man she loves I cannot say, but you are a loathsome scoundrel and you may
  resent that in any way you please."</p>

  <p>The blood flamed into Desborough's face. The contemptuous words cut him to
  the quick. And from the bottom of his heart he knew that they were so
  absolutely true. Then he shrugged his shoulders and passed on. What did it
  matter so long as he had won the game? He had the woman he coveted to be his
  wife, her fortune would be at his disposal. And he was up to his eyes in
  debt.</p>

  <p>If the crisis came he would be under a sea of bankruptcy, he would have to
  resign his seat and his political ambitions would be slain for ever. But once
  his engagement were announced his creditors would be only too glad to wait,
  the danger would be averted. There were the bills held by Minter, but
  Desborough did not want to think of that for the moment. He would have to go
  back to his chambers presently, there to have an interview with the witness
  Ericsson whose evidence had been so unsatisfactory on the first day's hearing
  of the Certified Company's case.</p>

  <p>There had been a most fortunate reprieve over that case. The whole thing
  might be compromised yet, and those bills held by Minter could be redeemed in
  the ordinary way of business. So long as the witness Price, the escaped
  convict, kept out of the way, the trial could not go on. Desborough devotedly
  prayed that the police would not catch him at all. In which case&mdash;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Kit Clive went home thoughtfully and slowly. His dreams were not
  pleasant ones to-night. After all he would not go home at all. It was not
  late and the company of the club smoking-room would be preferable to his own
  gloomy cogitations. As he passed along somebody halted and hesitated before
  him. Kit pulled up mechanically.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to speak to me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wondered," the other said, "if you would recognize me. I saw
  you go out of court as I was going in to give evidence, so that&mdash;but it
  doesn't matter. I am Charles Ericsson, we used to be in the same set in the
  old college days."</p>

  <p>There was a strange hesitation in the speaker's manner&mdash;a nervous
  trembling of the eyelashes, that told its own story. The man was not badly
  dressed, he had all the outward bearing and semblance of a gentleman, but the
  seal of drink was upon him. It was only a question of time.</p>

  <p>"I recollect now," Kit said quietly. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Ericsson raised his hands with a sudden spurt of passion.</p>

  <p>"Talk to me," he said. "For Heaven's sake bear with me. The others have
  left me to myself for an hour. I could not stand the house, so I came out. I
  promised that I would not touch a drop of anything, and it's hard. I shall
  fly to it if I am left alone. At eleven to-night I am to meet Desborough in
  his chambers. I must be sober for that. Clive, you were always a good soul
  and I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker clung to Clive's arm as if seeking protection from some unseen
  danger.</p>

  <p>"Come into my club," Kit said. "Oh, you are quite presentable enough. The
  fact that you are not in evening dress does not matter in the least. Come
  along."</p>

  <p>Ericsson followed, muttering his gratitude brokenly. In the full glories
  of the electric light he looked a pitiful wreck indeed, not in the least like
  the hard athlete that Clive had known not so many years ago.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been all this time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Everywhere," Ericsson said. "All over the world. And I would give my soul
  to wipe it all out and start afresh. It was all over a girl to begin with.
  She preferred another and I&mdash;well, I tried to drown my sorrow. And I
  fell from bad to worse. Look at me."</p>

  <p>The man spoke with the bitterest self-contempt. He was quite sober now.
  Kit regarded him pitifully. He could see that the other had fallen very low
  indeed. There was a wistful gleam in his eyes as a waiter passed with a tray
  of glasses that told its own tale.</p>

  <p>"If I could only help you," Kit said, "give you a chance to pull yourself
  together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Too late," the other muttered. "All the same I'm glad to have seen you.
  It's good to look an honest old pal in the face again. If I hadn't met you I
  shouldn't have passed the next public bar. Walk a little way with me."</p>

  <p>Kit nodded. He had nothing to do, and in a way Ericsson fascinated him.
  And it was always a pleasure to Kit to help anybody in trouble. Ericsson was
  talking more quietly now, speaking of the past. He pulled up suddenly and
  gripped Kit's arm. His face had grown horribly white, the bloodshot eyes were
  staring with terror.</p>

  <p>"There," he whispered, "by the lamp. For God's sake don't let him see
  me!"</p>

  <p>Kit half glanced around. He had heard of men acting like this on the verge
  of <i>delirium tremens</i>. And Ericsson was peculiarly near the border line.
  Doubtless he was looking at some hideous vision conjured up by his own
  disordered brain.</p>

  <p>"Steady," Kit cried. "Steady, man. Pull yourself together. It is
  nothing."</p>

  <p>Ericsson laughed in a quavering kind of way. He dimly comprehended what
  Kit was driving at.</p>

  <p>"It is not that at all," he said. "I'm horribly shaky, but my brain is
  clear enough to-night. It is that man standing there looking at that paper.
  Cross the road."</p>

  <p>The speaker was trembling from head to foot and sweating with terror.
  There was nothing very formidable about the man who stood quietly reading a
  paper and smoking a cigarette under a lamp-post. He seemed like a respectable
  mechanic in his best clothes, a thick-set, powerful-looking man with a hard
  face and a strong-determined jaw; there was a certain air of patience about
  him, an air of dogged determination. Once on the other side of the street
  Ericsson stopped and wiped his face.</p>

  <p>"I've had a shock," said he, as if talking to himself. "It was the same
  man&mdash;I never guessed for a moment that it would be the same man, not
  even when I heard that he was&mdash;It was a narrow escape for me&mdash;What
  was I talking about?"</p>

  <p>Kit replied that he did not know, which was no more than the truth.</p>

  <p>Ericsson laughed in a feeble, cackling kind of way that was not good to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"You've been very kind to-night," he said. "Very kind indeed. And much
  always wants more. And I've had a fright, I dare not go home alone. I shan't
  be at Desborough's chambers very long. Not more than half an hour. I wonder
  if you would stretch a point and wait for me. If you only knew what a fright
  I have had."</p>

  <p>He wiped his besotted face again, and his eyelids quivered. Kit nodded. It
  seemed all cheap and trivial enough, and from the bottom of his heart he was
  sorry for the other.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said cheerfully. "I'll stay here and smoke a cigar. And
  after that I'll see you safe home to bed. And I should say you need it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. FOLLOWING IT UP</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE sat on after her lover had gone, utterly unconscious
  of what was going on around her. She heard nothing of the clatter of voices,
  the ripple of laughter. She had come out to-night the happiest woman in
  London; within the compass of an hour she had become of all women the most
  miserable. She had lost the man she most cared for, she had given her promise
  to a man she despised. Her whole soul was filled with a loathing for
  Desborough.</p>

  <p>And he had made his meaning quite plain. Maude understood that
  Desborough's parable applied to them both. He was the strong man who was
  prepared to sacrifice everything to his ambition, honour, self-respect and
  all. He was the man loaded down with debt and struggling to free himself by
  means of a rich marriage. That his ambition was tempered by the fact that he
  really adored her did not move Maude a bit. To save himself he was going to
  take advantage of a disgraceful family secret and force her to marry him.</p>

  <p>Desborough had been brutal enough, he had burnt his boats and crossed the
  rubicon. And Maude would have to become his wife. She sat there overwhelmed
  by the mere suggestion of it. And Kit had been so kind and tender through it
  all. If he had only reproached her, only spoken as he had every right to do!
  Maude looked up to see Desborough standing before her.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come back into the drawing-room with me," he said. "I am
  going soon."</p>

  <p>He spoke with an air of proprietorship that Maude would have resisted. But
  what did it all matter? She would have to smile in the face of
  Society&mdash;to wear a mask in future. She would have to begin some time and
  the sooner the agony was over the better.</p>

  <p>"I understand you," she said coldly. "You want to show your property to
  the world&mdash;you want your creditors to know that they will be paid."</p>

  <p>Desborough winced slightly. After all he was not quite so hard as he had
  imagined.</p>

  <p>"I have always admired you," he said. "In any case I should have asked you
  to be my wife. I could not marry a poor woman, but even if you had been a
  poor woman, in my heart I should have preferred you to any one else. And I
  shall make you care for me."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed and her face grew hard.</p>

  <p>"Never!" she cried. "A girl might be your slave, nay, with a man like you
  she would have to be. But the real spontaneous love that warms so many a
  heart could not be yours. And I am not the one to change. I love Kit Clive. I
  shall go on loving him always. You need not be afraid&mdash;the breath of
  scandal shall never touch me. I shall always remain as pure in mind and
  thought as I am now. And I shall ever despise you. I shall ever know you for
  the man that you are. Others may envy you and point to your success, but your
  wife will know you for a poor, contemptible creature who forced a poor girl
  to pay for your follies and ambition at the price of her happiness and the
  content of her family. Now will you give me your arm?"</p>

  <p>Desborough stood quietly through it all. What he felt under the stinging
  lash of the girl's tongue she could only guess, he might have been carved out
  of granite but for the little red spot that burnt on either cheek. He held
  out his arm which Maude touched with her finger tips.</p>

  <p>Yet he glanced at her anxiously as they came into the full glare of the
  brilliantly lighted drawing-room. There was a smile on Maude's face and a
  little suggestion of weariness. People were looking at the striking couple
  and whispering together.</p>

  <p>"Will you congratulate me?" Desborough said as he approached his hostess.
  "I am very fortunate. Miss Beaumont has done me the honour to consenting to
  be my wife."</p>

  <p>The news flashed round the room. Maude overheard the felicitations of her
  friends with the same hard, brilliant smile. She longed to cry out to tell
  them that it was all a hateful sham. She had a passionate desire to be alone
  again, to throw herself face down upon her bed and cry her heart out. But the
  thing had to be played out to the bitter end.</p>

  <p>"Get me away," she whispered fiercely. "Find my chaperon, who will be glad
  to go. Call the carriages. If you don't I shall be forced to say something,
  to tell the truth, and once that is known I shall be free of you for ever. Do
  you hear me? Go!"</p>

  <p>Maude spoke in a fierce whisper, but the hard, brilliant smile never left
  her face. It was not until the carriage had driven away that Desborough felt
  easy in his mind. He walked thoughtfully along in the direction of his
  chambers.</p>

  <p>"I never knew that she had so much in her," he told himself. "She will
  have to be ruled, to learn to fear my power and respect it. And what a tongue
  she has. Well, she is the only one who knows that I am a scoundrel, and to
  draw back now would be to stamp me as a fool as well as a knave. Without
  Maude's aid I should have been a ruined man. Now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glared at the thought of the future. There were letters in his room
  awaiting him; one from his solicitor telling him of no fewer than three writs
  that had been issued against him to-day. Desborough smiled bitterly as he
  read the letter.</p>

  <p>"Minter is putting on the screw," he muttered. "I have to thank him for
  this. If I could only get from under that scoundrel's thumb I should be
  free&mdash;I could defy him. If I could raise that money! Perhaps I could now
  that my engagement is announced. Come in."</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Ericsson entered. He was still pale and ghastly;
  despite the freshness of the night, there were beads of perspiration on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," Desborough said. "You are the witness who has an appointment
  with me. You were not in a fit state to say much when I last had the pleasure
  of seeing you. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Those keen, cold eyes were looking at Ericsson searchingly. The pale face
  flushed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sober enough now," he retorted. "And I had a bit of a fright coming
  along. It was that man Price. Eli Price who was also a witness in the case. I
  didn't know it was the same Price that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," Desborough said curtly. "I am not interested in your
  private affairs. Now listen to me, and answer all that I ask you
  truthfully."</p>

  <p>For the next half hour Ericsson was replying to Desborough's searching
  questions. In that time he literally turned the man inside out. Then the
  lawyer rose and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"You can go," he said. "And keep sober next time. And don't try to deceive
  a lawyer again who has you in the witness box. That kind of thing leads to
  trouble. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Ericsson slipped away down the stairs, and almost instantly Desborough was
  immersed in a thick brief. He had forgotten everything else when the door was
  burst open and Ericsson dashed in. His face was white with terror, his eyes
  gleamed strangely. With a gesture of annoyance Desborough caught him by the
  shoulders and bundled him towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Confound you!" he said, "what do you mean by this? If you don't go
  away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I dare not," Ericsson screamed. "He is after me, he is following me
  here. If he comes he will kill me. Hide me somewhere, get me out of the way.
  Isn't there any back way out? Oh, surely you are not going to let
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Desborough pointed to a door on the opposite side of the room.</p>

  <p>"Try that way," he said. "It leads into a corridor, and there is a
  staircase that opens into a side street. Get along, and don't let me see your
  face again."</p>

  <p>With a gasp Ericsson darted away, and was lost to sight in a moment. Then
  came the sound of heavy footsteps up the main staircase, then the door was
  flung open without ceremony and a second man came furiously into the
  room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. TEMPTATION</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some time after Ericsson had passed under the archway
  leading to Desborough's chambers the man by the lamp-post stood reading his
  paper. Kit Clive passed him more than once, and wondered who he might be, and
  why the sight of him had such a paralyzing effect on Ericsson. The man looked
  quiet and respectable enough, not at all the kind of man to make a
  disturbance, but one who when once aroused was likely to see things
  through.</p>

  <p>Then Clive dismissed the fellow from his thoughts. He had plenty of matter
  to occupy his attention. He was wishing himself back home again; he was
  beginning to regret that he had taken all this trouble for so worthless an
  object as Ericsson.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the man under the lamp-post stood quite still, reading the
  newspaper. He threw it aside presently with a gesture of disgust, and strode
  forward. As he emerged into the light again he came full upon Ericsson, who
  was coming in the other direction. He might have passed unheeding, but
  Ericsson pulled up, and a hoarse cry escaped him. The other man looked up
  indifferently, then his face changed. An unholy joy blazed up in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Ericsson cried again ever so faintly. A policeman strode by without
  heeding. Eli Price sidled up to Ericsson, and held up his hand. It was like a
  chance meeting of two friends.</p>

  <p>"Well, mate," he said, "who would have thought of meeting you here!" His
  voice sank to a whisper. "I know what you would like to do, curse you. You
  would like to call that policeman standing there and tell him that here is
  Eli Price, the escaped convict. If you open your mouth I'll crush your skull
  in before you can say two words."</p>

  <p>Ericsson shivered. He was too utterly frightened for anything. As a matter
  of fact the very thing that Price had suggested had feebly flashed through
  his brain.</p>

  <p>"Yonder policeman is your safeguard and mine," Price went on in the same
  fierce whisper. "So long as our friend in blue stands there waiting for his
  sergeant I can't kill you in the way you deserve; so long as he stands there
  you have no cause to fear. So I've found you at last!"</p>

  <p>Ericsson shivered and said nothing. Like a hunted animal he was glaring
  about him for some avenue of escape. Commonplace people passed by, ignorant
  of the note of tragedy so close to them; a paper boy flitted along, yelling
  the latest news.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you speak?" Price snarled. "Say something. Try to look like a
  man. When I see you standing there I could kick myself for the fool that I
  am. However I came to trust such a white, puling, lily-livered coward passes
  my understanding. But I thought you were clever, I didn't know that you had
  soddened your brain away. And when you played me false and I found you out
  you had just cunning enough to put me away. And because you turned coward and
  saved your own skin I have been lying like a dog yonder, bullied by warders
  and half starved into the bargain. If the policeman yonder would only move on
  and give me the chance!"</p>

  <p>Price hissed out the last few words. There was murder in his eyes.
  Ericsson was too frozen with horror for a moment to see that the policeman
  was moving on at last. He could not see Clive anywhere. And once there was a
  chance to do so with impunity Price would certainly kill him. The knowledge
  set the poor wretch trembling like a leaf. A sudden cry came from his lips,
  and he darted off as hard as his legs could carry him.</p>

  <p>He rushed on headlong, blindly. He was fifty yards away before Price could
  follow him. With a kind of dull instinct he fled into the passage in the
  direction of Desborough's chambers again. Poor creature as he was, if he
  could find light and protection he would be dangerous.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool to stop him," Price muttered. "I might have followed him. If
  he gets to the ears of the police I am done."</p>

  <p>Price picked up his heels and followed rapidly. Another policeman had
  heard the cry, and called on him to stop. But there was no time for ceremony.
  Price disappeared under the dark arch like a shadow, whilst the man of law
  came most leisurely behind. Price shut his teeth grimly. If that constable
  proved to be too inquisitive he would have to be silenced; the officer stood
  a good chance of lying on his back on the stones presently with a concussion
  of the brain.</p>

  <p>There was just a glimpse of Ericsson as he disappeared up a flight of
  stairs. Price could plainly see the door into which he vanished. But he could
  not follow for the moment for the simple reason that the blundering policeman
  was searching about the arch. Price crept close into the shadow, as the light
  of the lantern flashed here and there. A moment later and a lane of light
  picked out the features and figure of the man in hiding.</p>

  <p>"Come out of that, my lad," a pompous voice said from behind the lantern.
  "I dare say it's all right, but just you come out and give an account of
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Price moved heavily forward. He had to control his face, but he was
  inwardly beating with passion. He was doing no wrong, he said; he had merely
  been having a few words with a friend. And if the policeman wanted to know
  his name and address&mdash;</p>

  <p>He broke off suddenly. He made a spring like that of a tiger, and then his
  fist crashed on the side of the officer's head. It was a smashing and
  staggering blow, and the man in blue fell with a snore and a grunt upon the
  pavement, his lantern rolling away as he fell.</p>

  <p>"Serve you right, you meddlesome hound," Price growled. "You won't worry
  about anything for a bit. But it was a pretty near shave."</p>

  <p>He hastened up the steps, forgetting all about the policeman, and
  everything else besides Ericsson. He <i>must</i> see that man again, at any
  hazard he must be frightened into silence. Yes, this was the door through
  which Ericsson had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He pushed his way in as coolly as if the place belonged to him. The red
  mist before his eyes rendered him reckless and blind to everything else. He
  hardly saw the owner of the room. Desborough started angrily from his desk.
  It was bad enough that Ericsson should come back in the way he had, but that
  the person pursuing him should force his way into a private apartment was
  intolerable. The newcomer was short and powerfully built; he had a strong,
  determined face, and withal the look of a gentleman.</p>

  <p>He was almost beside himself now with passionate eagerness, and for the
  moment did not seem to see Desborough at all. The latter was half amused in
  spite of everything. His mood had suddenly changed. He stood before the
  intruder and barred the way.</p>

  <p>"Make yourself quite at home," he said. "If there is anything that you
  desire."</p>

  <p>Price looked stupidly at the speaker. His glaring eyes seemed to come back
  from somewhere a long way off.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" he asked hoarsely. "Where has he gone to? He came back here,
  I swear. As soon as he saw me he gave a cry and doubled back. At first I
  couldn't believe my luck. But I was after him quick enough, and he came in
  here. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could tell better if I knew who you were looking for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for Ericsson. He came back here, I swear. If I could only
  hold him by the throat, if I could only choke the life out of him! Where has
  he got to?"</p>

  <p>Price's glance travelled over Desborough's shoulders to the door beyond.
  He muttered something like an oath. He crossed to the door, passed to the
  room beyond, then he came back again. There was something in this cool
  proceeding that irritated whilst it amused Desborough.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are quite satisfied," he said. "If there is any other
  information you require I shall be very glad to give it to you."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a cynical tone that was quite lost on Price. The latter was
  still breathing heavily, as if he had not yet recovered from the effects of
  his chase.</p>

  <p>"He's got away," Price said. "There was a back door. What's the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>Desborough fairly gasped. Cold and self-contained as he generally was, he
  thrilled now, he had made a discovery that thrilled him to the core.</p>

  <p>"I know you," he said. "You were convicted at last Hardcastle Assizes and
  sentenced to seven years. You came very near to proving one of the most
  ingenious alibis ever tendered in a court of justice. I am a barrister, and I
  was present at the assizes. Under ordinary circumstances you should be in
  gaol now. Let me see&mdash;what is your name?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you," the other said with a hard laugh, "seeing that
  you know so much. My name is Eli Price. And much good may the information do
  you."</p>

  <p>Desborough made no retort. This was the missing witness in the great
  Certified Company, under his own roof, the man whose extraordinary escape had
  given him an unexpected and blessed reprieve at the hands of Graham Minter.
  As a barrister or a future Cabinet Minister his duty was plain before him. He
  ought to have instantly called in the police and handed his visitor over to
  justice. But he did nothing of the kind, he sat at his desk thoughtfully
  turning over the situation. So long as Price was free he was fairly safe.
  Price back in strong hands again and he was in peril. He looked up suddenly,
  and Price smiled.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing to be amused at," he said. "If I do my duty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you are not going to do your duty," Price snarled. "I can read a face
  as well as most people. Yours is a cold and hard face, but you are not going
  to give me up. For some reason or another, you are going to keep your
  knowledge to yourself, to make use of me. Not that I care so long as you keep
  your tongue between your teeth."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. STILL FURTHER TRIED</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR once in his life Desborough had no retort ready. This
  man had read his mind with an accuracy that was amazing. He had yielded to
  the temptation, he dared not give Price up. So long as this man was at large,
  nothing very definite could come of the Certified Company trial, that fatal
  tampering with Desborough's brief would not be necessary.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, really?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," Price retorted. "I'm a public school and university
  man, and that is enough for you for the present. You ask no questions, and
  you will be told no lies. The point is that I left a policeman half dead
  outside, and that, all things considered, I should be more safe if I chose
  another exit. Is it possible to find one?"</p>

  <p>Desborough pointed to the door by means of which Ericsson had got away.
  "Try that direction," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is the caretaker's private right of way."</p>

  <p>Price nodded and disappeared. Hardly had he gone before there was a knock
  at the door. Before Desborough could shout a request for his visitor to come
  in, Price's bullet head was back again.</p>

  <p>"Locked!" he said crisply, "and only one light left. Caretaker's evidently
  gone to bed. What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" Desborough whispered fiercely. "I've got a visitor.
  Don't show yourself if you have any respect for your safety and my
  reputation. Go back!"</p>

  <p>Price nodded. It was all the same to him. He was quite safe where he was,
  and for some reason or another his involuntary host was going to shield him.
  Price darted back again and pushed the door to as Desborough's visitor
  entered. The barrister seemed to be poring over some papers as if he had no
  mind for anything else in the world. The shaded lamp flooded the table, and
  left the rest of the room in semi-darkness.</p>

  <p>Desborough looked up abstractedly at the slim, girlish figure. It paid him
  to pose like this. He made out a shabby dress, and a slim hand in a shabby
  glove, but he could not see the face.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I come from Mr. Denton," the visitor said. "He particularly asked me to
  let you have this typed notice to-night. And I could not find a messenger, so
  I brought this myself. Will you be so good as to look over the pages and see
  if they are correct?"</p>

  <p>The voice was gentle and refined, and pleasing to Desborough's ear. The
  notes were beautifully correct, and clearly done, and the barrister said as
  much.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," the girl said timidly. "I&mdash;I get my living that
  way. My name is Alice Price, and I live in Paradise Buildings. If you should
  ever have work of that kind to do I can do it well at very reasonable prices.
  I have a lot of time on my hands."</p>

  <p>Desborough listened with a certain interest. He had not the slightest
  feeling or compassion for anybody, but it struck him that there was a romance
  here. The girl was evidently a lady. As if by accident he pushed up the shade
  of the lamp so that the light fell full on the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"I must tell my clerk your name and ask him to give you an opinion or two
  to copy," he said. "If the work is quite satisfactory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Desborough stopped with a gasp. He saw a pale, beautiful face, delicate
  and refined, a face that was strange, and at the same time familiar to him.
  The girl looked mildly surprised.</p>

  <p>"A twinge of neuralgia," he muttered. "It comes from working too hard. Are
  you quite sure that your name is Price, young lady?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite certain of it," the girl said, flushing hotly. "I&mdash;I am
  married."</p>

  <p>"And before your name was Price was it not Alice Beaumont? Believe me, I
  am not asking out of any mere motive of curiosity."</p>

  <p>"It was a secret," the girl murmured. "In fact, it is a secret still. I
  cannot tell you how you found out, but I implore you as a gentleman not to
  let it go any further. If you know my people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know your people very well indeed, your sister especially so. It was
  your extraordinary likeness to her that told me who you were. All I know is
  that Mrs. Beaumont's younger daughter married unhappily, and there is an end
  of the matter. But surely, there can be no reason why you do not let them
  know that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Desborough paused in some confusion. With all his faults and vices, this
  acting the hypocrite was a new rôle to him. As a matter of fact, he was
  profoundly disturbed. The secret of the diaries that had come into his hands
  professionally had told him of the disgrace that had befallen Mrs. Beaumont's
  younger daughter. But then the diaries had also told him that the girl and
  the man to whom she had given her heart were dead. And here she was alive and
  well, but with every desire to keep the fact from her relatives.</p>

  <p>Clearly it was the policy of Clifford Desborough to aid in the deception.
  True, if Alice and her mother came together again, the disgrace would not be
  washed away, and he would still retain his iron grip on the fortune and
  person of Maude, but the extra knowledge would give him fresh power. It was
  strange that he and Alice should have met there at such a time.</p>

  <p>"I will do anything you like," he murmured. "For the present your secret
  is safe with me. Presently I shall hope to persuade you to divulge it. And I
  will take care that you have plenty of work to do, we have lots of it here,
  Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated over the name. The stranger flushed.</p>

  <p>"I am what I claim to be," she said proudly. "My name is Price. I couldn't
  prove the fact yet, but I hope to some day. I was bitterly deceived, but not
  in that way. But the time is coming when I shall be able to clear my name,
  such as it is."</p>

  <p>She spoke with a deep note of bitterness in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Your husband did not prove satisfactory?" Desborough asked.</p>

  <p>"The man that I claim for a husband was a scoundrel. He deceived me. He
  thought I had money, but I had none. All the money belongs to Maude, my
  sister. My father died poor, and Maude's money came from her godmother. The
  man I married thought we were co-heiresses. He never mentioned the matter to
  me. Oh, if he only had, if he only had done so."</p>

  <p>There were tears in the girl's eyes, a bitter regret in her voice. Then
  she drew herself up, and went on in a quiet voice. She was very like Maude,
  Desborough thought.</p>

  <p>"Not that it matters," she said. "I am fairly free, or thought I was free
  till to-night. It is not every woman who rejoices in the thought that her
  husband has been sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. But I was glad,
  really glad to hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your husband is in gaol?" Desborough asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you see when Eli&mdash;a pretty name, is it not?&mdash;when
  Eli&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Desborough was not listening. He was utterly dazed and confused for
  the moment. It had only just occurred to him that Alice Beaumont had given
  the name of Price. And that very Price at that moment was not many feet away
  behind a door that was not closed. The convict was here, and could prove if
  he liked the truth of the girl's words. Here was another and a still deeper
  temptation. A word, a sign, and Price would have gone back to the Fate that
  he had earned, and this unhappy girl would have been free to look the whole
  world in the face again. Like a flash, the thought of Graham Minter crossed
  Desborough's mind. He stepped over to the girl and laid a hand on her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake be silent!" he whispered hoarsely. "Remember that even
  here the walls may have ears. I hope you have not said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was shaking with excitement. The girl looked at him with wild
  amazement. What could he mean? What had she said or done to cause all this
  violent agitation on the part of so strong a man? Desborough read the
  questions in the girl's eyes. He drew a slip of paper and a pen to her.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite myself to-night," he said. "And I am more deeply
  interested in this case than you imagine. Write your address here."</p>

  <p>"Paradise Buildings," the girl said. "Just off the street that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Desborough stifled something like an oath. Silence was everything at this
  moment. The man in the inner room must not know.</p>

  <p>"Write," he said sternly, "and then leave me. I am very busy. That will
  do!"</p>

  <p>The address was set clown with a shaking hand, and the next moment Alice
  was in the street. Desborough called carelessly to the escaped convict. He
  lounged into the room. How much or how little did he know, Desborough
  wondered. But he could read nothing in Price's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Safe to go, eh!" he muttered. "Like my room better than my company, eh?
  Well, so long. But you haven't seen the last of Eli Price!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. A FREE MAN</h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE out in the roadway Price stepped out briskly. His
  quarry was not in sight, but he expected to come up with him presently.
  Really things were coming out splendidly for him. Only yesterday morning he
  had been a prisoner with no hope of freedom. In his wildest dreams he had not
  expected anything like this. He was to go to London to give evidence, to
  which he looked forward with more or less indifference.</p>

  <p>It would be a change, anyhow. He would see fresh faces and scenery, he
  would have the privilege of talking, at the stations where the trains stopped
  he would get something respectable in the way of food. There was something
  like a smile on his broad face as he thought of it. On the whole he looked
  forward to it.</p>

  <p>And here he was free! It had all come like a dream. There was a dissolving
  view of a struggle, the dull thud of blows, a vision of two warders lying
  back, dazed and white, in their respective corners of a third-class carriage,
  and then Price was speeding down a country lane in a high dog-cart with two
  strange companions. An overcoat had been hurriedly buttoned over his
  convict's garb, and one of his new friends proffered him a cigarette. The
  delicious flavour of tobacco filled Price with content.</p>

  <p>"What's it all mean?" he asked. "Where are you taking me to?"</p>

  <p>"No harm intended," the driver said. "Ask no questions and you'll hear no
  lies."</p>

  <p>They came to the outskirts of a wood at length, and there Price changed
  his stripes for a suit of artisan's clothing. It was nearly dark before the
  dog-cart went on again, and it was quite late when, coming down Hampstead
  way, Price could see the light of London. It mattered little where Price was
  going. He was free now and meant to remain so. The dog-cart pulled up at
  length, and at a sign Price dismounted.</p>

  <p>"Now foot it the rest of the way," Price's companions growled. "Then we'll
  give you some supper and a bed and tell you all about it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Price was in no mood to ask questions. The supper was good, the bed
  better, so clean and comfortable that Price slept far into the next
  afternoon. The luncheon was as good as the supper, and the escaped convict
  ate heartily. His taciturn companion pushed a box of cigarettes across the
  table and glanced at Price.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you'd like to know what all this means," he growled. "You'd
  better call me Jones. That ain't my real name, but it's good enough for the
  people here, and you're my brother Bill, up from the north, looking for a job
  as a boiler-maker. I'm a gas engineer. Is there anything more you'd like to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"A lot," Price said, as he pulled at his cigarette. "What have I got to
  pay for that little job yesterday? You didn't run all this risk to get my
  company for nothing."</p>

  <p>Price's rough manner had left him. He spoke with the air and manner of a
  gentleman. He picked his words slowly and there was a cynical flavour about
  them.</p>

  <p>"You've got nothing to do," the other said sullenly. "There's big people
  behind the job, though who they are I don't know any more than the dead. All
  I had to do was to get you out of the way, and to see that you don't go
  taking the air in the locality of the Law Courts. That's what I'm paid for
  and I'll see that it's done."</p>

  <p>Price pulled thoughtfully at his cigarette. So the reason of that daring
  and successful attempt at kidnapping was to prevent his giving evidence in
  the Certified Company case. For the present he was at a loss to understand
  why. How could the suppression of his evidence be of such vital importance to
  one party or another? But he would find out, as men with a jaw like Price's
  find out everything that they set their minds on. There might be money in
  this later on. For the present he was free. Till the hue and cry had died
  away he would be housed and fed and well looked after. There would be no
  going back to prison again. And Price was a man of resource, his knowledge of
  London was extensive and peculiar.</p>

  <p>"Then so long as I keep close, I can do as I like!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, can you?" the other sneered. "Not much. My orders are not to lose
  sight of you on any account. If the police pick you up again I shall have had
  all the trouble for nothing. You can go for walks after dark, but I go along
  too."</p>

  <p>Price smiled to himself as he lit another cigarette. He had not the
  slightest intention of being used as a puppet in somebody else's game. To
  their own ends some other people had set him at liberty. But his liberty was
  not going to be curtailed like that. He would give his gaoler the slip
  presently and lose himself in London.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, dropping into his rougher manner. "I'm not likely to
  go out so long as it is daylight. Leave me plenty of cigarettes and a paper
  and I'll make myself comfortable. Only I shall be glad of your entertaining
  company after dark."</p>

  <p>The other man lounged away, leaving Price to his own reflections. For the
  present he was tired, he dare not go out in the daylight. And even when
  darkness came he could not slip away as he might have done for the simple
  reason that he had no money. The other man seemed to be pretty flush, for he
  had taken out a handful of sovereigns to find a sixpence to send the
  landlady's little girl to fetch some cigarettes. Price's eyes gleamed as he
  saw the gold. If only that were in his possession he need not trouble his new
  friends any longer. And they need have no anxiety as to his coming in contact
  with the police. Price would see to that for his own sake.</p>

  <p>He read the paper carefully, as a man does who has been debarred from
  newspapers for a long time; he read of his own escape with a grim smile. He
  carefully noted the names of counsel engaged on both sides, for in his
  roaming life he had once been in the service of the Certified Company. But,
  puzzle as he would, he could find no reason why his tongue should have been
  tied in this way. It was quite dark before the other returned.</p>

  <p>"Come along and stretch your legs," he said. "We'll try a music hall
  presently."</p>

  <p>"You don't mind my sending a telegram?" Price said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," the other growled. "None of your nonsense. My orders were to
  let you communicate with nobody. You're being well looked after and well fed,
  and you ought to be satisfied. We'll have a drink at some respectable place,
  and you can go as far as the Momus in Oxted Road."</p>

  <p>Price professed himself to be perfectly agreeable. It was no cue of his to
  run counter to the wishes of his companion. But he set his teeth close as he
  heard the jingling of the sovereigns in the other man's pockets. It would go
  hard if those sovereigns were not his before long. "I'd like to have sent
  that telegram," he said, "but, after all, it doesn't matter much. There used
  to be a snug little house down this way that I knew years ago&mdash;the
  <i>Norfolk Arms</i>&gt;."</p>

  <p>The other man nodded. The <i>Norfolk Arms</i> was well known to him. They
  might just as well take their whisky and soda there as anywhere else. A
  florid-looking landlord with a fat face and a cunning eye started as he
  caught sight of Price. The latter passed a glance at his companion. He made a
  significant gesture of pouring something into a glass, and a moment later a
  tiny phial was dexterously slipped into his hand by the landlord under
  pretence of tendering his customer a match. The other man had seen nothing of
  what was going on.</p>

  <p>"Better be moving," Price suggested. "We don't want to be out late."</p>

  <p>The other man nodded. A half hour passed in the Momus watching a dreary
  and not too refined entertainment and in the consuming of more whisky and
  soda. A fight flared up in one corner, and Price's companion stood up eagerly
  to watch. Like a flash the little bottle came out of Price's pocket and the
  contents were dropped into his companion's glass. There was a sound of a
  scuffle, the sudden flash of a policeman's buttons and it was peace again.
  The other man drank his whisky with a remark that they sold pretty queer
  stuff at such places.</p>

  <p>"Come along!" Price said. "This isn't good enough. We're better at home.
  My nerves ain't very strong, and the sight of that policeman gave me a
  turn."</p>

  <p>The other man rose willingly. He seemed dazed and stupid as they reached
  the outer air. He muttered something about poisonous drink, he hung heavily
  on Price's arm. It taxed the enormous strength of the convict to get his
  companion along. They came presently to a new road where extensive building
  operations were being carried on. Price literally carried his now senseless
  companion into one of the empty houses and laid him on a pile of sacking. He
  plunged eagerly for the sovereigns into the other's pocket. There had been no
  mistake; here was a score or more of the precious, clinking, yellow coins,
  more than enough to keep Price in funds till he had developed his plans.</p>

  <p>"Well, my star is in the ascendant to-night," he muttered. "Freedom, a
  change of clothes, getting clear away to London, and a pocketful of money,
  all in a little over twenty-four hours. I ought to back my luck now that it
  is in. Good-bye, my friend, sleep well, and if you have a fine head in the
  morning, put it down to the Momus whisky."</p>

  <p>Price strode cheerfully along in the direction of London. It was a little
  past ten when he reached Oxford Circus. Here he stopped to dispatch a
  telegram. Then he wandered on filled with an exulting sense of freedom. What
  should he do next he was asking himself. He had a presentiment that further
  developments were coming. It was at this moment that a passing figure half
  stopped, there was the sound of an alarmed cry. And then it was that Price
  found himself face to face with Ericsson&mdash;Ericsson in the flesh, the cur
  who had laid a better man than himself by the heels. Price forgot everything
  in the exultation of the moment. What followed the reader already knows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. PARADISE BUILDINGS</h2>

  <p class="first">ALICE came at length to a gloomy thoroughfare with high
  tenement houses on either side that excluded the light of day. Here are
  suites of rooms let off to the struggling respectable classes, artisans,
  tailors, workers in wax and other flowers, and the many trades by which half
  the world ekes out a precarious livelihood. In one of these tiny flats Alice
  Price worked hard day in and day out at a typewriter.</p>

  <p>The room was barely furnished, a cheap lamp stood beside the typewriter,
  there was nothing there to denote anything but the direst poverty save for a
  lovely bunch of lilies in a tawdry glass jar. The poor girl who usually
  slaved at the typewriter looked not unlike a lily herself. She was young, and
  under ordinary circumstances would have been beautiful, but the dull despair
  of her eyes had taken all the flash and colour out of them, her face was
  rarely pale&mdash;the pallor that speaks out plainly of the want of proper
  food. And yet there was something very attractive about the girl, for she was
  little more. Alice flung herself into a chair with a sigh, her head was
  aching, her meeting with Desborough and his identification of her had
  disturbed her and robbed her of her sense of security. She would not go there
  again. And then she looked at the little packet of money Desborough had
  thrust into her hand at parting. And there was more to come from that
  quarter, and money was so hard to earn.</p>

  <p>"Eleven shillings," the girl sighed. "It seemed so much and yet so little.
  And the promise of regular work. I cannot&mdash;cannot turn my hack on it. I
  suppose God wills it this way. If only Mr. Desborough will be discreet and
  silent."</p>

  <p>There was a hurried knock at the door and a man entered. He was a tall,
  well-set man, with a cheery, pleasant face and a pair of resolute grey eyes.
  The girl smiled and held out her slim white hand.</p>

  <p>"How good you are always to think of me," she said. "Come in, Mr.
  Denton."</p>

  <p>Harvey Denton needed no second invitation; it was easy to see that
  something besides mere good-heartedness brought Denton to Paradise Buildings.
  There was a yearning look in his eyes that told its own story. He glanced
  down tenderly into the pale, flower-like face.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the least kind about it, Alice," he said. "You know
  perfectly well why I come here. My darling, if you would only take my advice
  and get rid of that man."</p>

  <p>Alice Price laid a trembling hand upon the speaker's lips.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she whispered, "you must say no more about that. You promised me.
  That man is my husband. It suits him to say that such is not the fact, that
  he had a wife alive at the time he married me, but he <i>is</i> my husband,
  and my duty is plain; and if I did what you ask I should bring shame and
  disgrace upon my mother and sister. They think that I am dead; it is far
  better that they should keep that delusion. I know that you love me,
  dear."</p>

  <p>"God knows that I do," Denton said hoarsely. "And you cared for me. I
  believe that you care for me still, only you are bound to what you consider
  your duty. And that man fascinated you; his indomitable will swallowed your
  weaker one altogether. And your father found out everything too late to save
  you. Your mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My mother knows nothing, and never shall," Alice said, with a
  determination that caused her voice to tremble. She looked strong and brave
  enough now. "Harvey, you found me out by accident. If you had not come here
  on one of your journalistic missions you would never have known. You have
  been very kind to me, and you will not betray my secret."</p>

  <p>The sweet face was pleading, and Denton yielded. But it was all very hard,
  when so near at hand. Alice had relations who would have received her with
  open arms, and surrounded her with every luxury. He put aside sentiment
  resolutely.</p>

  <p>"I've brought some more work for you," he said. "It's my own 'copy' which
  you are used to. They are some facts that I got up for Clifford Desborough,
  which he wants for that big case of his; but you have already done some
  'copy' on the same case. If you could let him have the 'copy' to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Alice nodded resolutely. She felt sick and tired tonight, but work meant
  money, and it meant that there was no time for idle repining.</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," she said. "I have already seen Mr. Desborough
  to-night; but I am sorry that I went, sorry my usual little messenger failed
  me. It was very unfortunate, but Mr. Desborough recognized me."</p>

  <p>Denton looked uneasy. He had not anticipated this. His heart softened and
  grew sad as he noted the pretty, pallid face. If he could only have induced
  Alice to let him help her more materially. But he had tried it once before,
  and it had nearly severed their friendship. Alice had sternly set her face
  against accepting more than the market price for her work. If he could only
  scheme a way!</p>

  <p>Alice half turned her head away, and the slim fingers played with the keys
  of the typewriter. Denton sighed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must go," he said. "I am afraid that we must wait and hope
  for the best. But if your mother and sister knew, I am sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But they must not know, Harvey; they must never know. One word, and they
  would be here at once. And it would break my mother's heart. I made my bed
  deliberately, and I must lie upon it. I left home and friends and everything
  that life holds dear for the sake of a scoundrel who thought he had married a
  fortune. He did not know that my sister had everything and I nothing.
  Good-night, dear old boy, and may God bless you."</p>

  <p>Denton kissed the slim, white hand in silence. He did not dare to trust
  his voice at present. And there were tears on the keys of the typewriter as
  Alice bent over them, tears that she brushed away and then went on with her
  work resolutely.</p>

  <p>She worked on mechanically for some time, till her fingers grew stiff and
  her weary eyes could hardly make out the keys. Her mind was in a whirl: she
  tried vainly to understand why it was that Mr. Desborough puzzled her. Why
  had he been so strange in his manner, and why had the name of Eli Price so
  strangely agitated him? Even in the seclusion of his own chambers he had bade
  her be silent, and had suggested that walls have ears. Then he had made her
  write down her address, as if fearful that somebody else was close by
  listening. But one thing Alice felt very certain about&mdash;Desborough would
  not betray her to her mother and sister. Alice put her typewriter up, and
  resolutely made up her mind not to think any more about it for the present.
  There was a stealthy footstep on the stair, and presently it stopped before
  the door. The latch turned, and a man came in. At the sight of him all the
  blood receded from Alice's face, and left her white to the lips.</p>

  <p>Price bowed ironically and smiled. In spite of his disguise, Alice
  recognized him instantly.</p>

  <p>"Paradise Buildings," he said mockingly. "Many thanks for the information.
  Our friend the popular barrister didn't want me to know that. But you blurted
  it out, and the escaped convict being in hiding in the back room heard all he
  wanted to know."</p>

  <p>Alice said nothing. She was too dazed and stunned by this unexpected blow.
  This man had humiliated and disgraced her enough. When the prison doors had
  closed upon him she had held herself to be free for some years to come. Then
  here he was back again, under her own roof, an escaped convict, a fugitive
  from justice, and she would be compelled to shield him. She could only sit
  there with a face white and ghastly, and regard her tormentor with sad
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"That swell friend of your family is up to something," Price went on. "It
  was his duty when accident took me to his rooms to give me up to justice. And
  why didn't he give me up to justice? Because for some reason or another he
  doesn't want me to give evidence on that trial I came up for. I don't know
  what his little game is, but I mean to find out. And when I do find out there
  will be money in it for me. And that chap won't betray you to your friends.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>Price asked the question again, and at length Alice found words to
  reply.</p>

  <p>"Because he is a gentleman," she said.</p>

  <p>"Rot. Because he's interested in that haughty sister of yours, because he
  means to marry her and have possession of all her money. Desborough is in a
  big position, and likely to be in a bigger one, but he is as desperately hard
  up as I am. But never mind about that. Go and get me a bottle of brandy and
  some cigars. The public-houses are not closed yet."</p>

  <p>Alice hesitated, and the man made a significant gesture with uplifted
  hand. He threw on the table a sovereign from his ill-gotten gains.</p>

  <p>"None of your pride," he muttered. "I thought I had broken you of that.
  Get the brandy and get the cigars, and then I'll tell you what I mean to do
  next. There's a fine night's work before you, my girl, if you only knew it.
  That white face and those mournful eyes of yours will make our fortunes
  yet."</p>

  <p>With trembling limbs Alice crept down the stairs. She passed into the
  street, but the cool night air failed to revive her. Just for an instant the
  world seemed to go spinning round her, and her reason was gone. When she came
  to herself her head was half reclining on a man's shoulder. As Alice drew
  back she found herself face to face with Harvey Denton.</p>

  <p>"Oh, leave me," she cried. "If you only knew, if you only knew."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. IN THE HOUR OF NEED</h2>

  <p class="first">DENTON could do no more than stand there waiting for Alice
  to speak again. That some new and overwhelming trouble had come upon her he
  could see from the expression on her face. He had never seen the poor girl
  hopeless before. But now the white drawn despair of those features touched
  him to the heart. The broad gleaming band from the electric standard close by
  shone into Alice's eyes as if they were deep pools. The dumb, patient misery
  of them moved Denton to something like anger.</p>

  <p>"You ought not to be here at all," he said in low, tense tones. "What is a
  beautiful refined creature like you doing in this vile atmosphere? Alice, I
  can't work properly for thinking of you. Even you cannot touch pitch without
  being defiled. It must be horrible."</p>

  <p>Alice shuddered. How horrible she only knew. A drunken ruffian staggered
  by with foul words upon his lips. A mad impulse to spring upon the brute and
  strike him to the ground was checked by Denton. After all, that would only
  make matters worse. Alice had forgotten her husband just for a minute. She
  was pure in mind and thought, but she loved this man, and he loved her, and
  both of them knew it.</p>

  <p>"A little place in the country," Denton urged. "A cottage where at least
  you could breathe fresh air and enjoy God's blessed sunshine. I could get you
  plenty of work to do. And here you are in some fresh and terrible trouble
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The words recalled Alice to herself. She started forward.</p>

  <p>"I cannot listen," she said. "I dare not. There is another trouble; yes.
  And I have to do something from which my soul recoils. If I dared ask
  you!"</p>

  <p>Alice's pale face flamed. Denton would have done anything for her.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked eagerly. "Only tell me. Anything in the world for
  you!"</p>

  <p>Alice stammered out an explanation. She wanted brandy and cigars. The
  latter she could get without any great inconvenience, but the former could
  only come from one of the great glittering palaces that seemed to breed and
  flourish like noxious blossoms in the foul miasma of a low neighbourhood. She
  had never entered one of these places as yet.</p>

  <p>"You are ill!" Denton cried. "It is for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"It is not!" Alice cried. "Oh, please do not ask me, indeed you must not.
  Get me a quantity, a large bottleful, so that I may be spared the humility
  again&mdash;and again. See, here is a sovereign. I am ashamed to ask you,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl could say no more. Just for a moment Denton stared at the
  glittering coin in Alice's little pink palm. Whence had that sovereign come?
  Such a sum was wealth to the girl. And why did she want so large a quantity
  of spirit? But the pleading misery in the poor girl's eyes robbed Denton of
  his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he said. "I shall not be long."</p>

  <p>There was a place close by, where he had been many times before in search
  of copy. He asked for a bottle of brandy, which was handed to him with a
  wink.</p>

  <p>"Four and nine to you, sir," the landlord said in a fat whisper. "Got
  something on, eh? See anybody here you recognize? Down the counter, drinking
  champagne!"</p>

  <p>Denton looked in the indicated direction. A man in evening dress stood
  with a small crowd about him drinking champagne.</p>

  <p>"So he's out again!" Denton said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And as large as ever," the landlord replied in the same oily whisper.
  "Better not let him see you, sir. He's got a dangerous gang with him, and
  he's had too much to drink."</p>

  <p>Denton nodded and withdrew, deeming discretion to be the better part of
  valour. There were a good many reasons why he did not want to encounter the
  man in evening dress at present, and Alice was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"How can I thank you?" Alice said. "I could not have gone there
  myself."</p>

  <p>"But why should you go at all?" Denton urged. "If this is an errand of
  charity, if you are providing for some poor fellow out of your own slender
  means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I am not. The money is not my own. Oh, I wish I could tell you. There
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alice paused. A wild, red flush spread over her face. Denton thought that
  he understood.</p>

  <p>"You are in the meshes," he said. "That man has dragged you down, and you
  cannot escape. If it is some vile confederate of his who is
  hiding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no! I would not permit that. Harvey, it is <i>the man
  himself!</i>"</p>

  <p>Alice glanced round fearfully, as if afraid that the walls might hear her.
  She felt a strange sense of relief now that she had told the truth.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Denton said. "Why he is&mdash;he is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was. Now he is up in my room. It is all like some evil dream. There
  was a footstep and a sound. Then I looked up and there he was."</p>

  <p>"My poor girl!" Denton groaned. "As if your punishment was not enough
  already! You will have to bear it now, to put up with it for a time. One
  comfort you have, it cannot be for long. He will try something desperate and
  get caught, the police will discover where he is. Alice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the girl had gone. She felt that she could stay there no longer
  without bursting into tears. One good and true friend remained to her, but
  she had not even thanked him. Hardly knowing what to do next, Denton stood
  irresolute on the edge of the pavement. He was a man who hated to be beaten,
  but he had to confess that he was baffled and beaten now.</p>

  <p>"I won't go away yet," he told himself. "Something tells me that she will
  want me again. Did ever a poor girl pay so terrible a price for mistaking a
  scoundrel for an honest man before? I ought to tell the police where the
  fellow has got to."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour passed, and Denton was still standing there, heedless
  of the flight of time. A loud burst of laughter smote on his ears, a little
  way down the road some man was parting with a little knot of companions. Then
  he separated from them and came swaggering towards Denton. His light overcoat
  was open, displaying his evening dress beneath. Denton crossed the road as he
  recognized the newcomer for the man he had seen in the <i>Bay Horse</i>.</p>

  <p>The man passed him now, and, paused before the block of buildings where
  Alice had her small abode. He merely looked at the number over the porch and
  strode in. A sudden inspiration came upon Denton, and he followed. There were
  many people passing up and down the corridor leading into Alice's room.
  Before it the swaggering stranger knocked, and then, without hesitation,
  walked in. Denton had more than he wanted to know for the present.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. WELL MET</h2>

  <p class="first">ELI PRICE looked up with a threatening scowl as his wife
  came back.</p>

  <p>"You've been time enough!" he said. "Where did you get this stuff? And
  where's the change?"</p>

  <p>Alice stammered out something. She had not the remotest idea where the
  brandy came from, and, as to the change, she had clean forgotten all about
  it. But with all his vices, Price was no lover of money for its own sake, and
  he could afford to be generous now, especially as his present supply
  represented no honest labour, nor the sweat of his brow.</p>

  <p>"Left it on the counter!" he sneered. "You talk like a frightened rabbit.
  I'd rather have gone myself, but it's a bit too dangerous at present. Give me
  a glass and a box of matches. Now you can sit down and talk to your loving
  husband. Feels quite like old times, doesn't it? So you are slaving here just
  because you are too proud to let your mother know that you are still in the
  land of the living. Why, you might be rolling in luxury, and in a position to
  defy me by saying two words."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand!" said Alice. "You never could understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps not! I sent a telegram off just before I had the pleasure
  of seeing your sweet face again, and I shouldn't be surprised if a friend
  turns up to see me at any moment now. If he knocks, you cut into your bedroom
  and lock the door. If you listen to a single word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price's face darkened again, and his eyes smouldered. "I have no desire to
  listen," Alice said with some spirit. "Have I not humiliating knowledge
  enough without desiring to learn the secrets of your dissolute companions? I
  shall go to bed."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't. You won't do anything of the kind. If you do I shall know
  how to get you up again. You've got to play sentry, my girl, and don't you
  forget it. Give me some brandy."</p>

  <p>For some time Price drank in silence. Presently there came a tap at the
  door, and Alice crossed the room and quietly disappeared. Despite his
  swagger, Price's heavy features bore a look of most unmistakable relief as a
  man in evening dress entered. With an air of used-up boredom he extended a
  slim white hand to his host.</p>

  <p>"A cigar? Certainly," he said. "And brandy, but not much of it. Upon my
  word, my dear Eli, we are a most remarkable pair of individuals. If we had
  chosen the rugged paths of honesty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can have all the honesty for me," Price growled. "I tried it once.
  You got my telegram?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was handed to me at the old shop. I have been a guest of his
  Majesty for the past six months, and only succeeded in bringing my stay to a
  finish yesterday. Quite a paltry affair, Eli."</p>

  <p>"What are you calling yourself just at present?" Price asked.</p>

  <p>"At present I am an Australian of means, the Honourable James Macgregor,
  squatter and all that. As I have been in Australia, it suits me very well.
  I've got chambers in Piccadilly, but no money. Money I must have before long
  or I shall be in a tight place. Fortunately I had practically worked out a
  little plant before his Majesty was so graciously pleased!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, stow it," Price growled. "What a chap you are to jaw. Why are you
  always so desperately anxious for people to know that you were brought up a
  gentleman? I was too, but nobody would guess it."</p>

  <p>"You're right there," Macgregor laughed. "My tongue does carry me away at
  times. But to revert to my little plant before his Majesty&mdash;all right,
  I'll get along. Yesterday and to-day I have been picking up the broken
  threads again and the plant's as good as ever. You're the very man I would
  have picked out to join me. It's a big thing."</p>

  <p>Price nodded and smiled approvingly. He was badly in need of money himself
  and a trip to Paris&mdash;that paradise of the cosmopolitan
  scoundrel&mdash;appealed to his imagination.</p>

  <p>"When do you want to try?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with to-night?" Macgregor answered one question with
  another. "I've got the whole thing at my finger's ends. No men in the house
  except servants, a garden leading into a lonely lane behind and any amount of
  valuables lying about. I've lost my interior plan of the place, which is a
  pity as the fool of a lady's maid who was such a mine of information before
  has left. But you've only to make a slit in the lining of your coat and there
  you are. I can find the way into the house, swell in evening dress and all
  that kind of thing, and you can take the swag."</p>

  <p>Price's eyes glistened. All his luck seemed to be tumbling into his lap in
  a heap. He was a man who above all things hated the inaction which looked
  like being inevitable to him for some days to come, and behold here was work
  to his hand and money wherewith to line his pockets.</p>

  <p>"You can count me in," he said carelessly. "Where is the crib?"</p>

  <p>"Forty-five, Royal Crescent. Not far from Hyde Park. Do you know it?"</p>

  <p>For Price was lying back in his chair laughing silently. There was
  something horribly suggestive about that noiseless mirth. He laughed till he
  shook again and the tears began to trickle down his coarse cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Pass it on," Macgregor suggested. "Don't keep it all to yourself. If
  there is anything wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's nothing wrong," Price replied, speaking with difficulty.
  "Only you amused me. It's one of those beautiful coincidences that people
  receive with incredulity, but which are happening every day of our lives. But
  it's a private matter that concerns myself, my noble Colonial, and you'll
  have to suppress that itching curiosity of yours. I'm going to laugh
  again."</p>

  <p>Once more the man's frame shook with mirth, Macgregor paced the room
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"When you've quite done," he muttered, "we'll get to business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll get to business right enough. Only I can see a way to make the
  matter easier and reduce the danger to a minimum. You will oblige me, my dear
  Macgregor, by taking a short walk and meeting me at the corner of Duke Place
  in half an hour. If I am alone, why then come and speak to me. If I appear in
  the congenial rôle of a squire of dames, then please follow at a respectful
  distance. Au revoir but not adieu."</p>

  <p>Macgregor disappeared discreetly. That Price had discovered some striking
  and original plan he felt certain. Usually he was morose enough, but when he
  became florid he was always pleased with himself and invariably saw his way
  quite clear.</p>

  <p>Once alone he pitched his cigar into the fireplace and locked up the
  brandy bottle after a short but sharp struggle with his animal desires. He
  crept across to the bedroom and flung the door open suddenly. Alice had not
  been listening as he had half suspected, for she was lying down half asleep,
  worn out with fatigue and anxiety. She started as the light fell upon her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Get up," Price said not unkindly. "I want a few words with you.
  Afterwards I may require you to accompany me for a little walk. Come
  along."</p>

  <p>Alice followed him in the sitting-room without demur, tired and worn out
  as she was. She found herself answering in a vague and misty way, questions
  that turned upon her past and the happy days before this dark love had come
  into her life, and she had lived at home with her mother and Maude. Out of
  the mist came Price's voice and woke her up.</p>

  <p>"So you could find your way in from the garden?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." Alice was lapsing into dreamland again. "I have done it more
  than once. One night I got locked out. There is a way of working the key in
  the garden gate. And there are steps up the ivy leading to the billiard-room.
  Some of the leaded lights are quite loose&mdash;I told mother and she said
  she would have it attended to, but she forgot. She forgets everything."</p>

  <p>"The billiard-room is absolutely in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, why do you ask the question?"</p>

  <p>Alice looked up quickly, but Price's face was averted. He said something
  about flowers. Alice's mind went back to the dear old garden and her vague
  suspicions faded into the air. She talked on, but far more to herself than
  Price; her eyes were heavy with unshed tears. She was only half conscious of
  the fact that Price had risen and was shaking her by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said. "We are going for that little stroll I talked
  about."</p>

  <p>"Are you going anywhere particular?" Alice asked.</p>

  <p>"We are and we are not. Put on a shawl and a good thick veil if you have
  one. Now cut along and get ready."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. THE MESH OF CRIME</h2>

  <p class="first">DESBOROUGH sat in his chair as the door closed behind Eli
  Price with a fear upon him that his iron nerve was failing. Nobody knew
  better than the brilliant barrister what the first meshes in the warp of
  crime led to. And yet his crime was in embryo; he had done nothing yet to
  bring himself within the grip of the law.</p>

  <p>But he was going to; he could not disguise the fact from himself. Up to
  now he had only been merely dishonourable, and if ever Maude Beaumont escaped
  from his grip she would never be likely to say anything to the discredit of
  her whilom lover. But Minter was pushing him further than that. Minter would
  have his pound of flesh, indeed only the extraordinary escape of Eli Price
  had prevented the South African millionaire from having it already. And here
  was the danger piling up on all sides, Price here in these very rooms, his
  wife actually within earshot of her dastardly husband.</p>

  <p>And there was another unseen force to reckon with. Who were the daring
  people who had ventured to rescue Price, and what did they mean by such a
  bold course? Desborough would have given a large slice of his big practice to
  know that. He never dreamt for a moment that Minter's creatures had been at
  the bottom of the strange affair.</p>

  <p>Anyway, this man of blood and iron was shaken now. He felt his nerves
  quivering, he could see that his hands were trembling. And he had boasted
  that he had no emotions. He felt half inclined to mix himself a brandy and
  soda, but he put the desire aside. Anyway, he could do no more work to-night.
  He would go to some of the many brilliant functions to which he had been
  invited; he would find Maude and take her home. If only he had not made such
  a fool of himself at college! But it was useless to repine about that.
  Desborough turned into his bedroom and dressed himself hastily.</p>

  <p>Maude was not in Clarges Street, though she had been there, nor was she at
  the Austrian Ambassador's. Desborough found her presently at a big reception
  in Lancaster Gate given by one of the American Society leaders. A band was
  playing somewhere, a few people were dancing, but the great majority of the
  company were absorbed in Bridge. Maude was not playing, but she was looking
  over the hand of a young Russian princess who seemed to be winning
  largely.</p>

  <p>She looked wonderfully attractive, though her face was deadly pale, but
  the brilliancy of her eyes made up for that. It was getting late now and only
  the chosen friends of the hostess remained. At a corner table Graham Minter
  was playing, his square face was rigid, his eyes fixed and clear. In a
  speculative way Harvey Denton was watching him. Denton had come on to
  Lancaster Gate in despair, deeming it useless to wait for Alice any longer.
  He wanted to forget that white face and those pleading eyes if he could. But
  he could see them everywhere. He was looking haggard and miserable enough
  himself, but he was taking no heed of his own feelings.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he could not quite put his professional instincts aside.
  Very little was lost upon those keen, if dreamy-looking eyes. He caught the
  expression of Minter's face as he met Desborough's glance; he saw the latter
  scowl and set his teeth. Then he looked up and found himself face to face
  with Kit Clive who had just come into the room.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen you lately," Harvey said. "Not since the
  engagement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Between Miss Beaumont and Desborough was announced," Kit said calmly. "My
  dear fellow, the thing was bound to be mentioned between us, seeing what
  friends we are. You desire to know all about it, only good taste prevents you
  from asking. You want to say you are sorry for me. I can't tell you anything
  because I don't know any more than you do."</p>

  <p>Denton tried not to look incredulous.</p>

  <p>"It's a fact, dear old chap. Miss Beaumont was engaged to me. There were
  reasons why the engagement was broken off and why Desborough took my place,
  but I never asked them."</p>

  <p>"She looks utterly miserable," Denton murmured. "I can't see behind that
  mask. She comes here because she cannot bear to be alone with her own
  thoughts. She loves you still, Kit."</p>

  <p>"Nothing can deprive me of that knowledge," Clive said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"And yet you are going to sit quietly down and&mdash;no, you are going to
  play a waiting game. Kit, I believe that I have made a discovery. There's
  something afoot between Minter and Desborough. I saw the threatening way in
  which our millionaire looked at the lawyer just now. Minter is at the bottom
  of this thing for certain. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to maintain a strict silence and keep my eyes open."</p>

  <p>"Good. Minter is giving one of his most brilliant weekend parties at
  Marvyn Chase on the 8th. I have been so fortunate as to secure an invitation.
  If you are asked also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am <i>persona grata</i> there. You see I am still more or less
  Minter's private secretary. My main duties have been to look after Lady
  Minter and arrange her functions for her. But I could tell a thing or two
  about Minter that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Denton said hoarsely. "Those will keep. The information may be
  useful later on, perhaps. You go down to Marvyn Chase on the 8th. I shall go,
  and I am certain that Desborough is going also. That being so, Miss Beaumont
  is sure to be asked."</p>

  <p>"Being Lady Mary's greatest friend, yes."</p>

  <p>"Good! We are going to get to the heart of the mystery. Already I have a
  pretty shrewd idea what it is, if I only dared tell you."</p>

  <p>Denton hesitated for a moment. He longed to tell Clive that Desborough was
  aware that Alice Beaumont or Alice Price was alive and that the lawyer was
  keeping the fact a secret for some reason of his own, but this would be
  betraying confidence.</p>

  <p>"But you are doing the right thing," he went on hurriedly. "Pretend to
  accept the inevitable and throw dust in the face of the foe."</p>

  <p>"I will," said Kit between his teeth, "but it's hard work."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Desborough who was bending over Maude with the air of
  proprietorship. There were women present who envied Maude for her beauty and
  her wealth, and her future husband. If all went well Desborough was pretty
  sure to be Prime Minister some day. If these people could only have looked
  behind the mask!</p>

  <p>"I have come to escort you home," Desborough was saying. "I was very busy,
  indeed. I shall have to go back and sit up half the night, but I could not
  resist the temptation."</p>

  <p>"The model lover makes the model husband," the hostess said in her
  high-pitched American voice. "Don't you agree with me, Clive?"</p>

  <p>Clive started but recovered himself in a moment.</p>

  <p>"It all depends upon how one reads the character, Mrs. Levassor," he said.
  "Anyway, Desborough has no excuse for being anything to the contrary."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Levassor smiled approvingly. With Society generally she knew that Kit
  Clive had been discarded for Desborough, but she always admired pluck when
  she found it, and Kit was behaving splendidly. Maude had turned away and was
  absently fastening her wrap. She did not want any one to see her face, for
  the moment. All she desired was to be out of this and at home again. That Kit
  had not followed her here she felt certain, his coming was a mere
  accident.</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready," she said. "Good-night, everybody. Good-night, Mr.
  Clive."</p>

  <p>She turned with a steady smile and held out her hand to Kit. Everybody was
  watching the couple furtively. But there was nothing to see, nothing to
  denote the fact that they were anything more than mere acquaintances taking a
  cordial leave of one another.</p>

  <p>"If grit and pluck go for anything," Denton said, "that smug barrister
  will be beaten yet."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. ON THE THRESHOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">THE carriage rolled along in silence, for Desborough seemed
  to have nothing to say once he was alone with Maude. Truth to tell, he was no
  squire of dames and he had a conscience of some kind under his hard exterior.
  That the girl despised him from the bottom of her heart he knew only too
  well. Desborough was not accustomed to be despised, he liked people to envy
  and respect him. The few halting remarks he made were accepted with curt
  monosyllables, and on the whole he was glad when the brougham pulled up
  before the door of Mrs. Beaumont's town residence.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come in?" Maude asked with visible coldness. "It is not so very
  late."</p>

  <p>Desborough had not meant to do anything of the kind, but he changed his
  mind. It appeared to him that this girl had not learnt her lesson
  sufficiently. If they were to live together he meant to be master, and she
  must be taught her place. He flushed with anger as he saw how Maude recoiled
  from his touch. And yet he had not made any lover's advances.</p>

  <p>"I will come in for a few moments," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>The softly-lighted drawing-room was empty, but a novel, face downwards on
  a chair, testified to the fact that Mrs. Beaumont was not far off. Maude
  threw off her wraps and dropped wearily into a chair. The yellow gleam from a
  shaded lamp touched her pale, beautiful, haughty face with a subdued light.
  She looked utterly weary and worn-out.</p>

  <p>"You are not treating me properly," Desborough said sternly.</p>

  <p>"I know it," Maude replied. She never glanced at him for a moment. She
  might have been addressing some disgraced cur. "If I did I would ring the
  bell and have you put out into the streets. If I did, I should tell everybody
  what a scoundrel you were and how you have taken advantage of a disgraceful
  secret to force me to become your wife. No, I am not treating you fairly, but
  I <i>am</i> treating you a good deal better than you deserve."</p>

  <p>It was a merciless speech delivered in a merciless tone of voice. The
  biting contempt of it cut Desborough to the quick. He began to see that he
  might break the girl, but he would never bend her to his will.</p>

  <p>"You care for Clive still," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"That is the class of remark that I should have expected from you," Maude
  said. "All the same, it is quite true. I love that man, and I shall love him
  to my dying day. All the same I am not going back upon my word. For the sake
  of those whom I love&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude's voice shook a little as she looked round the refined and perfectly
  appointed room. In her mind's eye she could see her mother white-haired and
  smiling seated in her favourite armchair with the perfumed lilies of the
  valley behind her. She could never bow that grey head, or chase the smile
  from those loved features, though her heart's blood was the price.</p>

  <p>"I am going to keep my share of the bargain," she said. "Usually people
  buy off the blackmailer, but I am going to give myself as well as my money.
  Unless you would care to release me from my bargain for a large sum of money
  down."</p>

  <p>Desborough's strong face flushed. It was a bitter, stinging insult, but he
  put up with it. Little as he cared for any one but himself he found a deep
  admiration for Maude stirring within him at this moment. What a wife she
  would make, how she would increase his position and his power! He would not
  let her go.</p>

  <p>"You are talking nonsense," he said. "I&mdash;I want you too."</p>

  <p>"I daresay. Well, the time for my punishment will come soon enough. But
  till then I am going to be free, you understand, <i>free</i>. You are not to
  follow me about, you are not to assume that air of proprietorship that makes
  my fingers tingle to strike you. Don't drive me too far, for I have my
  limits. I may break down before a whole room full of people, and tell them
  the shameful truth. And what would your future be worth if that
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Desborough was discreetly silent. There was a hard glitter in Maude's eyes
  that told its own story. Then her eyes softened suddenly, and she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"My mother," Maude whispered. "For Heaven's sake not a word of this before
  her."</p>

  <p>Desborough smiled in his turn. Here, at any rate, was the lash by which
  the girl could be flogged into reason. He said something hurriedly as the old
  lady with the white hair advanced into the room. There was no suspicion of
  anything wrong in Mrs. Beaumont's face as she greeted Desborough charmingly.
  Maude was smiling too as if she had held her happiness in her own hands.</p>

  <p>"And now I am going to turn you out," she said, holding out her hand
  frankly to her companion. "If mother begins to talk as late as this she
  cannot sleep afterwards. We must think of her."</p>

  <p>Desborough just touched the proffered hand and then dropped it. Mrs.
  Beaumont smiled.</p>

  <p>"Young people are so very different from what they used to be in my day,"
  she said. "Your poor, dear father would never have been content with a
  handshake like that."</p>

  <p>"We are more discreet and retiring," said Maude, with a laugh, that was a
  deal nearer to tears than either of her companions imagined. "Perhaps we
  can't find the necessary time for the higher emotions. Besides, we have been
  here some little time. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Desborough murmured something and disappeared. Just for a moment Mrs.
  Beaumont looked keenly at Maude.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope you will be happy," she said in a voice that implied
  exceedingly grave doubts on the point. "I suppose you are quite sure of
  yourself, Maude?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," Maude said, with her eyes turned away. "I am acting for the
  best."</p>

  <p>"You were always a good child, dear, so different from poor head-strong
  Alice. And yet I always imagined that it was Kit Clive whom you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go off to bed at once," Maude said cheerfully. "If you sit up any longer
  you will come down to breakfast looking like an amiable ghost. Kit and I are
  very good friends, and we shall always remain so. Now you go off to bed
  without delay."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Beaumont went off obediently. That she always did what people told
  her to do was no doubt the reason of her popularity. As the door closed
  behind her the smiling mask dropped from Maude's face, leaving it white and
  set and miserable. Should she ever be able to go through with this thing? she
  wondered. She heard nothing of the house being locked up and the snapping out
  of the electric lights. The maid came in presently and pointedly asked if
  anything was required.</p>

  <p>"You can go to bed, Sellers," Maude said. "I will do for myself to-night.
  There is a book that I want to finish first. Good-night."</p>

  <p>The smart maid retired thankfully. Maude sat in there, busy with her own
  painful thoughts. A clock somewhere struck one, but she did not heed it. She
  began to grow tired and heavy at length, she would go to bed also, and forget
  her misery. Somebody appeared to be moving in the billiard-room, and then
  Maude awoke to the fact that it was nearly two o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what it is," she murmured. "Everybody must have gone to bed long
  ago. It is possible that one of the servants&mdash;but not in the
  billiard-room."</p>

  <p>All the lights were out, but Maude knew her way perfectly. She walked
  across that hall and down the passage leading to the billiard-room without
  troubling to switch on the light again. The girl's physical courage was high,
  she had no fear of any one.</p>

  <p>She looked into the billiard-room where the table loomed ghostly before
  her. Just for a minute she stood there listening intently. Along the roof was
  a kind of flat gallery in the form of a long glass beneath the dome light,
  and something was tapping against that like a bird that had flown far and was
  dazzled by a great light.</p>

  <p>"It is a bird," Maude told herself. "Perhaps one of the house pets
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused as a faint light broke out behind the glass gallery. She could
  hear voices. Then there was a rush of cold air from somewhere and the outline
  of a face illumined by a wax vesta. As Maude caught sight of that face she
  bit her lip to suppress a scream.</p>

  <p>"My sister Alice," she murmured. "I am mad or dreaming. It could not be
  Alice, and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stood there looking up in an attitude of rigid attention.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. SOMETHING LIKE A GHOST</h2>

  <p class="first">IN fear and trembling Alice followed her lord and master,
  though her limbs tottered under her and her eyes were half blind with sleep.
  In a dazed kind of way she realized the fact that Price was in a more genial
  mood than he had been before, always a bad sign with him, and one that
  generally meant mischief later on.</p>

  <p>It was getting late now, but there were still a few people about, cabs and
  carriages flashed by, daintily dressed women on the arms of their escorts, a
  troop of laughing girls going home from a party.</p>

  <p>Alice had not been in this part of the world for some time; indeed, owing
  to the dread of exposure and detection, she had kept away from the West. But
  it all seemed strangely familiar now, and like the time when she, too, had
  been a happy, careless girl with no heed for the morrow, except the pleasure
  that it was going to bring.</p>

  <p>How many years ago was that? she wondered. Not so many by the flight of
  actual time, but it seemed like an eternity, and she was very young
  still.</p>

  <p>Price addressed a remark to her, but she did not reply, she was far enough
  away for the moment. Then she became conscious that he was pressing her arm
  cruelly hard.</p>

  <p>"Always half asleep," he growled. "Always thinking of something else.
  Seemed like yesterday to me when I caught sight of your face in that
  barrister chap's office and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price paused and muttered something. He had not intended to tell Alice how
  he had found her out. He wanted the girl to be duly impressed by his own
  amazing cleverness. But Alice was no longer dreaming, she was looking keenly
  in her husband's face.</p>

  <p>"So you were in the inner room," she said. "It was only by pure chance
  that I went to see Mr. Desborough to-night. I needed work and money, but I
  would have starved for both if I had only known what the result was to
  be."</p>

  <p>Price paid no heed to the bitter speech. He had betrayed himself over a
  small matter, but he hated to do it all the same. Perhaps his presence in
  Desborough's office would puzzle Alice. As a matter of fact, it did.</p>

  <p>What was the escaped convict doing under the same roof as the
  distinguished lawyer who was freely mentioned as the forthcoming Cabinet
  Minister? The matter found Alice food for thought for some little time.
  Perhaps there was some connexion between the two men. Price looked common and
  brutal enough now, but he was a gentleman by birth, and before his fall he
  had mixed in the same class of society to which Desborough belonged.</p>

  <p>Alice abandoned the attempt to solve the problem. She looked around her
  curiously. Surely she was on familiar ground. A little to the left was Dupont
  Street, and here was the lane leading to the stables behind the house where
  her girlhood had been passed. And here was the lane also that ran behind the
  gardens of Royal Crescent.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" Alice asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll see presently," Price replied, in a voice obviously intended to be
  pleasant. "Wait here just for a moment. And if a policeman comes along, drop
  back into the shadow."</p>

  <p>Alice had nothing further to say. Her heart was beating violently. She
  knew quite enough of Price to feel that there was some mischief on hand. She
  was to be this man's tool now as she had been many times before. The old sway
  of terror was still upon her&mdash;the fear of personal violence.</p>

  <p>A policeman came along presently, and Alice crouched in one of the green
  doorways, feeling very much like a criminal herself. Well, it did not matter
  much. She was tired and weary of the struggle, hope had deserted her. Perhaps
  she would be better in gaol. A wild desire to step out and warn the policeman
  was only suppressed from fear of Price. The officer paused as the light of
  his lantern danced like a ghost down the lane.</p>

  <p>"If it were anywhere else," Alice groaned, "if it were not so near to my
  old home? What would they say if they knew how close I am?"</p>

  <p>Price strode back into the main street with his hands in his pockets. He
  was taking a huge risk seeing that he was being sought after everywhere, but
  the man's courage never failed him. Audacity was his motto, and he had never
  yet come to regret it. True, he had come to grief at last, but that was
  partly owing to the treachery and the cowardice of Ericsson. Once the present
  little mission was accomplished he would cross the Channel and lie low in
  Paris till the scent got cold.</p>

  <p>Price whistled gently, and Macgregor appeared from somewhere. He looked
  quite the West End lounger just going home from some fashionable
  function&mdash;at least, that was the impression he created late at night and
  under the artificial light. Whether he would have passed muster in the
  sunshine was quite another thing.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're trying my patience," he said. "What's the game, and who's
  the woman?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind who the woman is," Price said doggedly. "That's my business.
  I've got a bit of pride left, and my lady friend is not to be mixed up in
  this affair more than is necessary. There's a bit of coincidence here if you
  only knew it."</p>

  <p>Macgregor nodded, but discreetly asked no questions. He had a fine respect
  for Price's perspicuity, and he also remembered Price's silent mirth when 45,
  Royal Crescent was mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I'll do just as you tell me," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course you will. Did I ever make a mistake yet? There is no burglary
  to be done here, no chance of any suspicious noises, nothing but to walk
  boldly up to the door of forty-five and pretend to ring the bell. You can
  stand on the doorstep, and when the man in blue goes by, you can wish him
  'good-night' and he'll do no more than touch his helmet to you."</p>

  <p>"Good! I always hated extra trouble, Price."</p>

  <p>"There will be no trouble. Wait here till you see a light in the hall.
  Then cross over and pretend to ring the bell. The door will open to you and
  you just walk in as big as life. After that I'll join you and we shall come
  out of the front door and walk away leaving somebody inside to clean up the
  trail. This is one of the neatest things you ever took a hand in."</p>

  <p>Macgregor expressed himself with due enthusiasm. It sounded indeed like a
  beautiful plant. Price walked back to the lane where Alice awaited him. His
  manner was curt and short.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said. "I dare say you have guessed where we are going to,
  haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Alice trembled violently. A dim suspicion of the dreadful scheme had come
  into her mind. She would have drawn back only Price gripped her arm
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said. "For purposes that need not be published, but
  merely as a guarantee of good faith, as those newspapers say, we are going to
  visit your childhood's happy home. We are going to look again on the scene so
  familiar to you before you gave up the world for the sake of a man who is
  utterly unworthy of you. How do you open the door?"</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," whispered Alice. "There is something dreadfully wrong
  going on here. I cannot do it. You may illtreat me as you have done before,
  but&mdash;oh!"</p>

  <p>The cruel grip tightened on her arm. Price's eyes gleamed fiercely in her
  face. His hot, brandy-laden breath seemed to scorch her.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to murder you?" he hissed. "Do you want me to take you by
  your white throat and choke the life out of your body? Fool that you are to
  pit yourself against me. There is a knack in opening this door. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>The cruel pressure still remained till Alice felt faint and sick.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," she panted, "oh, what a coward you are."</p>

  <p>"Call me any name you like, but open that door."</p>

  <p>"Let my arm go, and I will do so. You lift the latch and lift the door at
  the same time. It is too stiff for me, but perhaps you can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door was open in a minute and closed behind the two figures as the
  ghostly dance of the policeman's lantern light came down the lane once
  more.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. "BEWARE OF THE DOG"</h2>

  <p class="first">SO far, so good, Price told himself. They were quite safe
  now and all danger had been cleverly averted. In the quiet seclusion of that
  well-appointed garden nothing was likely to happen.</p>

  <p>Just for the instant Alice had forgotten her fear. She was immersed in a
  sea of painful and pleasing recollections. Under the cedar tree she had read
  her favourite books on hot afternoons, in the corner by the nut trees stood
  the little conservatory where she had grown her flowers. Here was the little
  summer house where she had written her innocent love messages to the
  individual by her side whom she had deemed to be the best of men. Her eyes
  filled with tears and she saw nothing for the moment.</p>

  <p>But Price was a fine antidote for sentiment. He dragged the girl along
  till they came to the billiard-room which was built out of the side of the
  house and possessed a flat roof with the glass gallery in the centre. The
  wall was covered with ivy.</p>

  <p>"How do you get to the top," Price suggested.</p>

  <p>Alice explained that there was a series of iron steps here and there, but
  they could not be seen owing to the fact that they were covered with ivy. Her
  father had the steps built in case of fire.</p>

  <p>"But you could easily find them!" said Price.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I could find them blindfold," Alice said drearily. She felt as
  if she were doing all this in her sleep, or as if her will had been merged
  into that of her companion.</p>

  <p>"I could open the gallery door to the billiard-room. The gallery inside
  runs round the dome. A flight of steps lead to the floor."</p>

  <p>"Up you go, then," Price said with a chuckle of satisfaction. Everything
  seemed to be making for his luck to-night. "Up you go and I'll follow. After
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. No need to tell Alice too much. She fumbled among the ivy in
  the same dreamy way, glad to be here and yet longing to be away from it all.
  The hypnotism of Price's presence urged her on. Often afterwards she tried to
  recollect that hour but always failed.</p>

  <p>They were on the flat roof at last, with the glazed gallery before them.
  Absolutely obedient now, Alice touched one of the sashes, and it gave to her
  shaking fingers at once. It was pitch dark in the billiard-room, the place
  was not overlooked from anywhere. Price cautiously lighted a vesta. As he did
  so, the box slipped from his hand and tinkled on the floor of the
  billiard-room.</p>

  <p>"Don't use such language," Alice implored, "it is horrible, it makes me
  tremble."</p>

  <p>She thrust her face eagerly forward, a white face, faintly illuminated by
  the match. It seemed to her that another face was looking up at her, but she
  was too dazed and stupid to be certain. But Price had no illusions on that
  score, the face was quite plain to him.</p>

  <p>"I could cut my own throat," he growled. "I could kick myself from here
  to&mdash;come along, we're spotted! Let's get out of it at once."</p>

  <p>Maude looking up into the dim, white face of Alice, slowly recollected her
  scattered senses. She was not quite sure yet what had happened, she was
  willing to admit that perhaps she had been startled by a chance likeness,
  wonderful as it was, but she did realize that some predatory characters were
  trying to get into the house. They had come by way of the garden doubtless.
  Well, they should not escape if Maude had her way.</p>

  <p>But she must not wake her mother, and there was no time to lose. Maude
  flew into the basement, flicking up the lights as she went. Then she whistled
  softly, and a magnificent specimen of a bloodhound came bounding forward up
  the steps.</p>

  <p>"Good Gambit!" Maude whispered. "Come with me. This way. Softly, old
  fellow, softly, or we shall smash the windows. Ah, that is right."</p>

  <p>A window leading to the lawn was open at length, and the faint sweetness
  of the night air came in. Maude pointed to the darkness. She could make out
  the outline of swiftly moving figures. She saw the bristles rise on the dog's
  back.</p>

  <p>"Hold them up!" she said. "Mark them, Gambit!"</p>

  <p>With a low growl and a flash of his teeth the dog bounded forward. Price
  heard the sound. He released Alice's hands, intent only upon saving himself.
  He reached the green door, but the stout oak resisted all his endeavours.
  Evidently there was another way of opening it from the inside. Overhead was a
  wall nearly ten feet high. Here also was a tree, nothing much in the way of a
  tree, but sufficiently high for anybody to be beyond the fangs of that
  dreadful hound.</p>

  <p>Alice plunged forward over the trim fresh flower beds, startled and dazed,
  and without the slightest idea where she was going. She tripped over a tangle
  of pegged down verbena, and came headlong to the ground. The next moment the
  dog's muzzle was close to her throat.</p>

  <p>"Gambit!" she said, in a dazed, dreamy voice. "Is it you, dear old
  Gambit?"</p>

  <p>The huge hound was evidently puzzled. In that sagacious steady brain of
  his some memory was stirred. Clearly there was no enemy here. Gambit liked
  that voice, he recognized the fact that it belonged to a friend whose
  features he had forgotten for a moment. On the whole, he liked that voice
  very much, and all the more so because the speaker had recollected his
  name.</p>

  <p>The tense spines went down on his back, and his tail wagged slightly. He
  licked Alice's face, down which the tears were streaming. Gambit was telling
  her quite plainly that she was safe. Then there came a little puff of breeze,
  and the pronounced smell of a foe, and Gambit realized that there was work of
  the most important kind on hand.</p>

  <p>Yes, there was the enemy up the tree. Gambit crept towards the harbour of
  refuge on the tips of his toes and his hair like a mane rising from his
  powerful shoulders. Price would have said something but he was too
  frightened, more frightened than he had ever been in his life before. There
  was a hard lump in his throat, his heart was hammering against his ribs, big
  drops beaded his forehead. He saw a figure all white lace and glittering
  jewels coming down the garden, but he dared not call out. The faint cry would
  mean the summoning of the police, and once he was in the hands of the police
  he could say good-bye to liberty for many a day to come.</p>

  <p>Maude glanced curiously about her, half expecting some sudden yell for
  help. Those people must still be in the garden, for they could not have got
  away in time. And one of them was a woman. Ah, here she was lying on one of
  the flower-beds with her white face upturned. A dreadful thought overwhelmed
  Maude for one terrible moment. Here lay the victim of the dog, Gambit had
  killed her. But then, Gambit was perfectly trained, and he never disobeyed
  orders.</p>

  <p>Maude bent over the figure on the verbena bed.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not hurt," she said. "Let me assist you to your feet."</p>

  <p>The other girl rose without any assistance. She drew a handkerchief from
  her pocket and spread it over her face. She spoke through the muffled folds
  in a voice that was hoarse and strained.</p>

  <p>"I am all right," she said. "The dog has done me no harm. You are a woman,
  like myself, and therefore you must have pity. Let me go at once, ask no
  questions, and let me go at once. Oh, if you only knew how innocent I am! The
  dog knows, poor Gambit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alice paused, conscious of the fact that she had betrayed herself. Maude
  had heard, too, and the knowledge strangely moved her.</p>

  <p>"I can feel for everybody," she said. "But you are coming into the house
  with me. I presume the man who was with you escaped? No, he is up the tree
  yonder, and Gambit is guarding him. Good dog! He is quite safe for the
  present. But you are coming with me?"</p>

  <p>"If you would only let me go," Alice urged.</p>

  <p>"If you are in trouble, as you seem to be, you will find a good friend in
  me. And I want to see more of the stranger who knows the name of my dog.
  There are more things in Heaven and earth&mdash;Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Maude asked the question almost fiercely. Alice showed her white set
  face.</p>

  <p>"You will have to know," she said. "I have tried my best to keep my
  miserable secret, but Fate has been too strong for me. I am your sister
  Alice!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. HOME!</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE held her breath for a moment. She had caught sight of
  the face of a woman looking down into the billiard-room, a face that reminded
  her vividly and resistlessly of her dead sister, but she had put this out of
  her mind at once as so much mere fancy. But now there was no longer any room
  for doubt.</p>

  <p>The voice was that of Alice beyond question. It was impossible to see more
  than the outline of her features now, dark as it was. Maude was wondering
  vaguely whether the man had escaped, for the tree in which Price had hidden
  was out of sight and out of earshot also. A low, snuffling snarl proved to
  Maude that Gambit had not failed. He would do the intruder no harm beyond
  holding him up until he received his new orders.</p>

  <p>The fellow should have a good fright, he should be left to his own devices
  for a time, at any rate. Maude laid a hand that shook a little on Alice's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I am like one who hears a voice from the grave," she said. "Even now I am
  not quite sure whether I am dreaming or not. Come with me, dear."</p>

  <p>Alice shrank back afraid. She could see the gleam of lights beyond the
  open French window, the tender green of the ferns, and the brilliant glare of
  the blossoms, a picture stood out here and there in its gold frame. It was
  all so quiet and refined, so different from what Alice had been used to of
  late. A great longing for the sight of home came upon her.</p>

  <p>"You had better let me go," she whispered. "Let me step back into
  obscurity, and forget that you have ever seen me. I have disgraced you
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Dearest, you are my only sister. You must come along. We must get to the
  bottom of this strange mystery. And this house is quiet. Come
  before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Before that man sees you," Maude was going to say, but Price was thinking
  of nothing beyond the saving of his own rascally skin.</p>

  <p>He had eyes only for the brilliant row of flashing teeth, ears alone for
  the snarling of the great dog. He dared not move for fear of having his life
  torn out of him; he dared not shout, for that meant the intervention of the
  police, and the asking of important questions certain to lead to permanent
  trouble. He did not know if Alice had escaped, he did not care for the
  present. If he could only have rid himself of the dog, if only his clumsy
  fingers had not allowed that match-box to slip, if only he had not
  telegraphed to Macgregor. Cramped, and sore, and stiff, Price huddled up to
  the tree, reviling everything but himself.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the two girls were moving on towards the house. Maude closed the
  window behind her, and pulled down the blind. Alice looked about her with
  tear-filled eyes. Every object there seemed to bring back some happy
  recollection. Nothing seemed to have been changed. There were the pictures
  and the armour, and the old oak chests just the same, but with a greater
  glamour upon them by contrast with the sordid surroundings to which Alice had
  lately been accustomed.</p>

  <p>"My mother, is she well?" she faltered. "She knows nothing?"</p>

  <p>"She knows nothing at all, Alice. She is as ignorant as I was up to a few
  minutes ago. Of course, she knew that you made a foolish marriage, but how
  foolish it was my father kept from her. That you had been tricked and
  deceived, and that the man was no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alice made a gesture as if she would speak, and then checked herself.</p>

  <p>"You know what a weak heart mother had!" Maude went on. "She has got over
  her trouble now. She mourns you as a dear one lost."</p>

  <p>"She must not be undeceived!" Alice exclaimed. "You must keep the secret,
  Maude."</p>

  <p>"For the present, yes, but I shall find a way. How tired and worn out you
  look. Child, child, do you get enough to eat?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," Alice said unsteadily. "It is hard to live. I did not realize
  what it was to be poor until I left home."</p>

  <p>But Maude was not listening. She bustled out of the room, to return
  presently with a large plate of dainty sandwiches and a decanter of port
  wine. She positively refused to listen to another word until Alice had
  dispatched the lot. Alice forced herself to eat slowly, though her eyes
  gleamed at the sight of the fair food, a glass of port brought back the
  colour to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"It's dreadful!" Maude said unsteadily. "My own sister actually in want of
  a meal! I could cry when I look at your dress, too. How do you live?"</p>

  <p>Alice explained with a simple directness that the tears came into Maude's
  eyes again, but Alice was perilously near to breaking down again, and it was
  no time for sentiment.</p>

  <p>"Horrible!" Maude cried. "Horrible! Fancy living in a place like that, and
  never knowing from day to day where your next meal is to come from! And being
  liable to be turned into the streets if your rent is not paid to the day. And
  yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> lived, Maude. It is wonderful what one can endure without
  breaking down."</p>

  <p>Maude looked steadily at her sister. The face was drawn and white, but it
  was pure and innocent as it had been when Alice was a little child. Trouble
  had not sullied her nature.</p>

  <p>"I thought I knew what sorrow was," Maude murmured. "But my trouble is
  nothing to yours. And the man who is responsible for all your trouble?"</p>

  <p>"You mean my husband?" Alice asked simply.</p>

  <p>"My darling, I wish I could use that word even in connexion with such a
  man!"</p>

  <p>"You can. Did I ever tell you a lie, dear? Eli Price is my husband. He
  says not, but I shall prove the truth some day. He thought I was rich, he did
  not know the fortune was all yours. If I had been rich the certificate of my
  marriage would be produced at once. If I was suddenly to come into money,
  Maude&mdash;What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>Maude had started violently. Then she checked herself.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," she said hurriedly. "We will talk of this again. Where is
  that man?"</p>

  <p>"He is here, in London. He came to me to-night. I thought I was at any
  rate free from that bitter scourge, but it was not to be. He has escaped from
  gaol."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Maude cried, obviously interested. "I forget what he called
  himself."</p>

  <p>"He has as many names as the sand on the sea shore, but he was convicted
  under his real name. I am privileged to call myself Mrs. Eli Price!"</p>

  <p>Maude nodded thoughtfully. She had more than half expected this. And so
  her sister Alice was the wife of the man whose name was on everybody's lips
  at present, the missing witness in the famous Certified Company case who had
  disappeared so strangely.</p>

  <p>"How did he find you out?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite by accident, by the same Fate that seems to dog me everywhere!
  Harvey Denton had found me some legal copying to do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, so Harvey Denton was in your secret! I should never have guessed
  it."</p>

  <p>"Harvey Denton was always a good and loyal friend, Maude. He loved me, and
  I was foolish enough to laugh at him. If I could only shake off my fetters I
  should never laugh at Harvey again. I know what a good and true man he is.
  Oh, Maude, Maude, if I could only recall the past!"</p>

  <p>Violent sobs shook Alice's slender form. She lay for a little time with
  her head on Maude's shoulder; it was a long space before she could speak
  again.</p>

  <p>"Usually I sent my work," she went on, "but to-night my messenger was
  engaged. So I had to take the matter round myself. By pure bad luck my
  husband was in the inner room of the barrister's chambers, and he recognized
  my voice. He followed me home, and that is the reason why I am here with you
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Strange for a lawyer to conceal the presence of an escaped convict,"
  Maude mused. "He must have known who Price was. Who is your lawyer
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clifford Desborough. And, oh, Maude, he is the man to whom you are
  engaged!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. THE MAN, THE WOMAN, AND THE DOG</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE could not grasp it all at once. It was impossible to
  look Alice in the face and believe that she was telling anything but the
  truth. But at one word she had doubled the mystery, and puzzled Maude more
  than she had been puzzled before.</p>

  <p>It was passing strange that Desborough should hide in his own chambers the
  most important witness he had in his <i>rôle</i> of leading counsel for the
  plaintiff in the great case of Mackness and the Certified Company. Up to this
  evening Maude had regarded her future husband as a man utterly devoid of
  heart or feeling, an ambitious man who was marrying her solely because her
  wealth would remove certain obstacles from his path. He had most
  unscrupulously made use of a professional secret, but there seemed to be
  worse behind.</p>

  <p>"We must go into this," Maude said hoarsely. "But first, tell me how you
  got here?"</p>

  <p>Alice told her story as coherently as possible. She had been brought here
  so that the house might be burgled in a practically safe fashion, but the
  accident of the falling matchbox and the forgotten presence of Gambit had put
  an end to the pretty scheme.</p>

  <p>"I see," Maude said thoughtfully. "The house must have been marked down
  for robbery for a long time. Your husband's visitor to-night gave him the
  plans, and, seeing that you knew the house so well, Price bettered the
  scheme. We shall see about that presently. Alice, are you quite sure that
  Price was hiding in Mr. Desborough's rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain. To my great alarm, when I got there, Mr. Desborough
  recognized me. And when I told him who I was, he was frightened. Yes, that
  strong, self-reliant man was frightened! He begged me not to speak so loud.
  Maude, I hope you are not making a mistake. I can't see how you can really
  love that man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Love him!" Maude cried. "I loathe him from the bottom of my soul. If I
  heard to-night that he was dead, I should be glad, glad, <i>glad</i>!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Maude, my dearest sister, do you mean to say that you
  also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can tell you nothing!" Maude went on more quietly. She could say
  nothing of the truth without betraying the fact that it was Alice herself who
  was responsible for all this heartfelt misery. It would have been a cruel
  thing to do at present, and no good could come of it. Later on, perhaps.
  "Clifford Desborough is a scoundrel, despite his high position, and the fact
  that he has a Cabinet portfolio almost within his grip. He recognized you,
  and yet he never said a word to me when he brought me home to-night. He knows
  that you are alive, and yet he withholds the information from me. And he
  conceals in his own room the very man whom he ought to hand over to justice.
  Why did he want that man to escape? But I am going to find out. I am pledged
  to Clifford Desborough, and, if necessary, I will keep my word. But if I can
  find any way of honourable escape, I shall take advantage of it. We are two
  lone girls with not too many friends, but God will not desert us."</p>

  <p>"There is Kit Clive," Alice suggested.</p>

  <p>The warm blood flamed into Maude's face.</p>

  <p>"I was engaged to him," she whispered. "He asked me quite lately. And I
  said yes, I was the happiest girl in London, for I loved him, and he loved
  me. He cared nothing for my hateful money. If I had known the sorrow and
  misery that money was going to bring to me I would have changed it all into
  sovereigns and thrown it into the lake at Mayton. I had to go back on my word
  and tell Kit that I could not marry him."</p>

  <p>"That you did not love him, eh, Maude?"</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of the kind. I said that all must be over between us. And
  Kit took it splendidly. I fancy that he must have partly understood. He is my
  good friend now as ever. I have only to hold up my hand, and he will come to
  me. Oh, my bonny, bonny Kit!"</p>

  <p>Maude's voice broke off and she hid her face in her hands. It was Alice's
  turn to play the comforter now. But she could only hold her sister tight in
  her arms and smooth her shining hair. There are times when words are useless,
  and this was one of them.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what to say," Alice whispered.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to say," Maude replied, dashing the tears away bravely.
  "It may sound silly of me, but your presence here gives me fresh hope and
  courage. Fate has brought us together again for some good purpose. My plans
  are vague yet, but I begin to see my way. Alice, you must go back to your old
  life again for the present. It cuts me to the heart to say so, but it is
  necessary. You must deceive your husband, you must let him believe that you
  escaped owing to your superior knowledge of the premises. Cultivate Clifford
  Desborough, go to his chambers as frequently as you can, pick up every scrap
  of information. Can you do this for me, dear?"</p>

  <p>"I can do anything to try and atone for the past," Alice said bravely. "It
  is a hard struggle."</p>

  <p>"It is not going to be a hard struggle any more," Maude cried. "You shall
  have no further anxiety as to your daily bread. I can quite see why you
  refused to accept any favours from the hands of Harvey Denton. Thank God,
  darling, you are your good and pure self in spite of everything. But you are
  going to let me help you, I shall be miserable if you refuse."</p>

  <p>"I can refuse nothing to my own dear sister. There is hope before me
  now."</p>

  <p>"That is the way in which I like to hear you speak. Here are five
  sovereigns for you. Let me know when you want more. And if you desire to see
  me, why that is quite easy. I cannot come to you, but you can come to me any
  time you care to make an appointment. That can be done through a newspaper,
  say the <i>Express</i>. And now I am going to turn you out."</p>

  <p>Alice rose wearily. The reaction had set in now and her limbs were like
  lead. But there was a feeling of lightness about her heart that she had not
  known for many a day. She had a true friend now, and no fear for the future.
  She had been nearer to the cold hospitality of the pavement and a bed on the
  Embankment seats than she cared to contemplate. She moved towards the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Not that way," Maude said. "You are going out of the front door.
  Good-night, darling. And don't let it be long before I see you again."</p>

  <p>Maude was alone again with her own uneasy thoughts. It was very late now,
  but she had not the slightest idea of bed. It would have been impossible for
  her to sleep at present. She turned the situation over in her mind, but she
  could make very little of the confused tangle. The thing that puzzled her
  most was the connexion between Eli Price and the brilliant Desborough. Surely
  Price must possess a powerful hold on Desborough for the latter to shield him
  like this.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if I could only find out what it is," Maude exclaimed. "Why, the very
  idea."</p>

  <p>She passed out of the room into the passage and then into the garden by
  the French window. She crossed the lawn; and called softly to the dog. A
  whine and a snarl gave Maude her direction. In the faint light she could see
  Gambit at the foot of a tree, his black muzzle looking upwards.</p>

  <p>"So you are up there," Maude said quietly. "Draw off, Gambit. Now, sir, I
  shall be pleased if you will come down. So long as I am here the dog will do
  you no harm. You will be good enough to follow me to the house, where I can
  see you better."</p>

  <p>Price slipped down the tree and staggered across the lawn. He found
  himself presently in the dining-room where Maude had turned up the lights.
  The horrible, cramping stiffness was going from his limbs now, he looked
  about him eagerly for some means of escape.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked sulkily.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you," Maude said. "No, you are not to sit down. Men of
  your class are not allowed to sit down in the presence of ladies. You will be
  good enough to stand there and answer my questions. I know more of you than
  you suppose. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"If you want to know, it is Edward Staunton."</p>

  <p>"That is not true. It will pay you to be candid with me."</p>

  <p>"I could crush you," Price growled. "I could crumple you up like a sheet
  of paper."</p>

  <p>"If I were alone," Maude said coldly, "but you see I have a companion who
  takes a keen interest in my welfare and yours. Look there."</p>

  <p>The dog was lying in the doorway with the deep-set, red eyes fixed on
  Price's face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. BLACK SUSPICION</h2>

  <p class="first">THE dog lay there blinking his deep-set eyes and telling
  Price as plainly as words could speak that it was as much as his life was
  worth to move. A queer sensation played up and down the spine of the
  ex-convict. He generally could see his way out of tight places, but here was
  one which was frankly beyond him.</p>

  <p>He looked round the beautiful room with its shaded lights playing upon the
  Louis Seize carved oak furniture, against which the old silver gleamed, and
  back again to Maude, beautiful and calm, in her flowing white dress. A gleam
  of admiration came into Price's eyes. It was just possible that this girl
  might let him down easily.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what you want?" he suggested. "I admit being in the
  garden."</p>

  <p>"Denial would be rather ridiculous," Maude put in. "You were on the top of
  the billiard-room, which is not exactly the place for an honest gentleman
  taking an evening walk. Where is your confederate?"</p>

  <p>Price had no confederate. He had come quite alone. The lie came readily
  from his lips, and his eyes were steady as he met Maude's glance.</p>

  <p>"I felt certain that I saw a woman with you," Maude said.</p>

  <p>"I was quite alone," Price said glibly. "This is no woman's work."</p>

  <p>Maude permitted the point to pass. Evidently Price had seen nothing in the
  garden. He had not the remotest idea that his wife had been in the very room,
  and Maude had her own reasons why the man should remain in ignorance of the
  fact.</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it," she said. "But if you try to deceive me
  again, it will be the worse for you. Why did you give me a wrong name just
  now?"</p>

  <p>"If you know so much perhaps you know my name also," Price sneered.</p>

  <p>Maude half-smiled as she looked into the sullen face. "I know your name
  quite well," she said. "You are Eli Price. Once you were a gentleman with a
  good and honourable name, but that is long ago. You are the man to whom my
  poor sister owes all her misfortunes. We deemed you both to be dead, but in
  your case the adage that 'one who is born to be hanged never gets drowned'
  holds good. Where is my sister?"</p>

  <p>"She must have gone down with the ship," Price muttered uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so," Maude went on. "You are astonished at the extent of my
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>Price was, but he had no intention of saying so. He was alarmed and
  uneasy. He could have taken this slender girl by the throat and crushed her
  easily, had it not been for that infernal dog. Every time he made a gesture
  Gambit moved uneasily. Those red eyes were ever upon him. Yet the feeling was
  growing upon him that Maude meant him no harm. She seemed to read his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to call in a policeman," she said. "So far as I am
  concerned you are not going back to gaol yet, though of course that is only a
  matter of time. I have what you would call the pull of you, and I want
  certain information."</p>

  <p>"As much as you like," Price said more cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Then we will begin at the beginning. How came it about early this evening
  that you were hiding in the inner office of Mr. Clifford Desborough?"</p>

  <p>Price gasped. Of course he had meant to play with Maude, and tell her as
  little or as much as he pleased. But it seemed to him that he had more than
  met his match here. There was no sign of weak womanish triumph on Maude's
  face, she looked perfectly tranquil and beautiful, and she seemed so
  absolutely certain of her ground.</p>

  <p>"Who told you this?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"That does not concern you in the least. You were hiding in the place I
  mention. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because the police were after me, of course."</p>

  <p>"That is not true. If such had been the case Mr. Desborough would never
  have compromised himself for a moment. Prominent barristers who are freely
  spoken of as future Cabinet Ministers do not harbour escaped convicts. Nor is
  Mr. Desborough what you would call a humane man. Why did he allow you to hide
  in his rooms?"</p>

  <p>"To tell you the honest truth, I don't know," Price replied. "I met an old
  enemy of mine in the street, and he gave me the slip. I tell you I felt like
  murder just for the moment. But for Ericsson I should never have seen the
  inside of a gaol."</p>

  <p>Maude made a note of the name. Price was speaking the truth now, she felt
  certain.</p>

  <p>"And you don't know why Mr. Desborough befriended you?" Maude went on. "He
  recognized you perhaps."</p>

  <p>"He did. He was present in court at the time I was convicted. And he let
  me go. It wasn't out of any kindness, I'll take my oath to that. I'm a pretty
  good judge of a face, and if ever I saw a face without feeling or soul behind
  it, that face is Desborough's. And he let me go."</p>

  <p>"You are puzzled," Maude said. "Shall I explain to you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. Seems to me I had better learn the truth. Why did he let me
  go?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about Mr. Graham Minter, the South African
  millionaire?"</p>

  <p>The question appeared to startle Price. He looked at Maude with deep
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"You're a clever one," he said. "I never met a woman to touch you. You've
  got a pretty scheme in your mind now, and yet I can't for the life of me see
  what you are driving at."</p>

  <p>"You are not intended to. I shall be glad of a reply to my question."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've known Minter for years. Knew him when he was holding horses
  for a living. If I happened to be free&mdash;I mean free to go about the
  streets like other men&mdash;I could make a good thing out of Minter."</p>

  <p>"Only your misfortune prevents it. Ericsson managed to get you into
  trouble&mdash;" The name slipped off Maude's tongue as if she had known the
  man all her lifetime. "Now, did it ever strike you that Minter desired to
  have you out of the way, and that the creature Ericsson was used as a tool to
  do so?"</p>

  <p>Price glared at the questioner. The point had never occurred to him
  before. His admiration for his beautiful antagonist deepened. What a head she
  had to be sure!</p>

  <p>"Never," he said hoarsely. "But you've let some daylight into this thick
  head of mine. I should never have thought of that. Why, when Minter&mdash;and
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have no time to go into that," Maude said. "We'll take the past for
  granted. You were to be brought up here to give evidence in a certain case in
  which Mr. Minter is deeply interested. On your way here you were forcibly
  taken from the custody of the police. It was a lucky accident for you, but
  even now you are in ignorance as to the identity of your friends."</p>

  <p>"That's so," Price admitted candidly.</p>

  <p>"And you have taken no trouble to ascertain what the particular case was.
  I see you are still in the dark. Warders in prisons don't chatter much with
  their prisoners. The case in question is one in which Mr. Minter is deeply
  interested, and where fortunes are involved&mdash;Mackness and the Certified
  Company it is called. Do you know anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"I know the whole thing from top to bottom."</p>

  <p>"I expected that reply. Doubtless your evidence would have damaged Mr.
  Minter's case severely. He or some clever tools of his procured your release.
  So far so good. But Mr. Desborough is on the other side, and therefore when
  he recognized you, should have taken immediate steps to secure your
  safety&mdash;I mean secure your appearance in the witness box. Instead of
  this he deliberately shields you and lets you go as soon as it is safe for
  you to leave his chambers. Why?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, I don't know any more than the dead."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am going to find out. I am going to use you for what I hold to be
  a good end. But no more to-night. Give me an address where a letter will find
  you so that I may send for you when I need your services. Write it down on
  this card, and then you can go. On the whole, I am disposed to think you are
  a lucky man, Mr. Price."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. KIT HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE saw her way pretty clearly before she finally retired.
  Her thoughts were full of the subject as she took her breakfast. There was
  some strange rascality here and she was going to get to the bottom of it.</p>

  <p>It had been Clifford Desborough's bounden duty to call in a policeman as
  he recognized Eli Price for an escaped convict, but he had done nothing of
  the kind. More than that, he had deliberately connived at the escape of an
  important witness in his case, a case, moreover, for which he was being well
  paid. Why Desborough had done this Maude did not know, but she had every
  intention of finding out.</p>

  <p>By a mere trick Desborough had forced a promise from Maude, and that
  promise she would keep unless she could prove that Desborough was not worthy
  of the hand of a good woman.</p>

  <p>But who could help her now? There was only one man, and he had told her
  that he would come to her side any time that she was in trouble. There was
  nothing for it but to ask Kit to call on her. It cost her an effort to write
  the friendly little note, and she breathed easier as it was posted. There was
  just a chance that Kit would come the same afternoon. Mrs. Beaumont had gone
  out calling and Maude left instructions that she was at home to nobody but
  Mr. Clive.</p>

  <p>Kit came in the course of the afternoon, a little quiet and subdued, but
  with no change in his manner. He was not even dignified, there was just a
  shade of sadness in his eyes, his face was just a little anxious. He took
  Maude's hand and carried it to his lips.</p>

  <p>"This is good of you," she said, with a hot flush on her face. "Oh, Kit,
  if only you knew how grateful I am for all your kindness. And after I have
  behaved like this!"</p>

  <p>"You are all right," Clive said, with assumed cheerfulness. "You said I
  was not to ask any questions. And in spite of everything you love me
  still?"</p>

  <p>"Are my eyes so truthful as all that, Kit?"</p>

  <p>"They are always truthful to me. And you do love me still?"</p>

  <p>"God knows I do. I shall love you all my lifetime, dear old boy. And
  <i>he</i> knows it; I told him that my heart would ever belong to another.
  Kit, you ought to hate me."</p>

  <p>"It seems the proper thing to do," Kit said dolefully. "But I don't. There
  is some deep rascality here that I shall get to the bottom of yet. I shall
  never give up hope so long as you are free, Maude. And I am ever and ever
  your good and true friend."</p>

  <p>Maude held out her hands impulsively. The next moment Clive's arms were
  around her and his lips were pressed to hers. The world was forgotten for the
  moment. Then Maude gently drew herself away and wiped the tears from her
  eyes. A great wave of carmine swept over her face.</p>

  <p>"We are both very foolish," she whispered. "And yet where is the wrong? I
  am my own mistress still. Kit, you sit there. Badly as I have behaved, I did
  not send for you to make love to me. My dear boy, I have found light in the
  darkness. The light has shown me some terribly repulsive things, but even
  they have their uses. Now listen to last night's adventures."</p>

  <p>Maude told her story plainly and clearly to an appreciative listener, Kit
  following with the deepest attention. His eyes were gleaming as Maude
  finished.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I can help you," he said. "It sounds very mean, but I am obliged
  to allude to Desborough in terms none too complimentary. Mind you, I am not
  taking advantage of my position to abuse my rival. But as a boy, Desborough
  led a very fast life."</p>

  <p>"That is not very serious," Maude smiled. "No woman ever admired a man
  less because she knew that he had been a little wild in his youth."</p>

  <p>"But that fact is the source of all the trouble, Maude. Desborough's
  father was a poor parson, and Desborough went to college on a small allowance
  and his scholarships. He chose to live with the best, and the consequence was
  that he came down at the end of his career some thousands in debt. Those
  debts have hung round his neck like a millstone ever since. There have been
  heavy costs and interests to pay, law proceedings and the like. Once a man
  gets into the hands of a money-lender he is doomed unless he has pluck enough
  to go through the bankruptcy court. But that would have been fatal to a
  barrister with brilliant prospects. At the present time Desborough owes over
  £10,000, and his big fees are swallowed up by the sharks who have bled him
  all these years. He has gambled and lost money. He represents a very Puritan
  constituency who would ask him to resign to-morrow if they knew half that I
  know."</p>

  <p>"Where do you get all these facts?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"You forget that I have been for so long Mr. Minter's private secretary. I
  think I told you of the clause in my father's will that compelled me to keep
  to business till I was twenty-five. I am a few weeks over my time now and I
  am only staying with Minter till he can find a successor. I gathered these
  facts from him because he rather wanted to make Desborough his standing legal
  adviser and, to put it plainly, have a hold over Desborough."</p>

  <p>"Did he go any further than that?" Maude asked. Clive moved a little
  uneasily on his chair.</p>

  <p>"I am betraying the secrets of the prison house," he said. "But with those
  beautiful eyes upon me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind my beautiful eyes, sir. I am not asking out of&mdash;idle
  curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Well, Minter did go further. I know for a positive fact that he has
  recently bought up all Desborough's bills, so that if he liked to press for
  payment he could make Desborough a bankrupt to-morrow. In that case he would
  have to resign his seat and his political career would be ruined."</p>

  <p>Maude listened thoughtfully. Much was being made clear to her now that had
  all been dark and confused to her before. Doubtless Minter had let Clifford
  Desborough know of the hold he had, and the barrister had played a desperate
  card in order to make a rich woman his wife.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Minter going to lose that law case?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I fancy so," Kit replied. "But, you see, Price has
  disappeared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Got out of the way by Mr. Minter," Maude interrupted.</p>

  <p>"After what you tell me it seems likely," Kit said thoughtfully. "He is
  not a man to stick at trifles. Our friend Desborough would have got the truth
  out of Price."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite agree with you," Maude whispered. "He is in Minter's power.
  If he suppressed certain questions, the verdict would have gone against
  Clifford Desborough's client. Kit, that is why those bills were bought up.
  Clifford has been told what will happen if he presses a certain point. I feel
  sure of it as if I had been present and heard the conversation."</p>

  <p>Clive started. The suggestion had not occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said hurriedly. "It could not be held up in judgment against
  Desborough. People would have said that he had not shown his usual astuteness
  upon the case and there would have been an end of it. But to think that a
  leading K.C. should dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it has been done once or twice before. And look at the terrible
  temptation. Fancy you and I sitting here and discussing the man whom I am
  pledged to marry. If I had read a situation like this in a novel I should
  merely have laughed. But I can't go through with it, I <i>cannot</i> marry a
  man who acts like this. And I cannot break off my engagement&mdash;at least
  not yet."</p>

  <p>"Is there any hope?" Kit asked, with a gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dear old boy, there is every hope. Only you must be near me and show me
  how to act. Our future happiness depends upon the events of the next few
  days. I had refused Lady Mary's invitation for her week-end party at Marvyn
  Chase, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Change your mind," Kit said eagerly. "They will all be there, I shall be
  there. The drama will move under our eyes, and now we have but the key to it.
  If you are brave and strong we shall find the way to victory yet. And when we
  do, Maude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I shall be the happiest girl in the world again. Kit, I cannot do
  without you, I will not give you up. We must find a way."</p>

  <p>Kit rose and took Maude in his arms again. He kissed her once, and put her
  from him.</p>

  <p>"Courage, my darling," he whispered. "Love will find a way."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. ROGUES IN COUNCIL</h2>

  <p class="first">PRICE drew a long breath like a swimmer who comes to the
  surface after a dangerous dive. After all he was going to escape, this
  beautiful creature was allowing him his freedom. Even the dog seemed to
  understand, for he rose at a sign from Maude and lurched heavily into the
  hall. Then the door was opened and closed, and Price was under the stars.</p>

  <p>Well, it had been a very pretty adventure, though the ex-convict was
  puzzled, and there was an uneasy feeling that he had been bested by a woman
  who was making a tool of him. He lighted a cigarette thoughtfully. Perhaps
  there was money in this thing. Anyway, he would keep in touch with Maude so
  long as the police did not interfere. He would&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a pretty nice fellow," a voice growled in his ear. "Been
  taking an inventory of the furniture with a view to a season in town? Here
  have I been dodging up and down for near two hours and no sign of you. What
  have you done?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Price replied. "I've had an adventure. We were spotted, Jim. My
  lady accomplice got away right enough, but a big dog chased me up a tree, and
  there they kept me for a long time. Then I was asked to walk into the
  dining-room and explain things."</p>

  <p>"But there is no man in the house besides the servants."</p>

  <p>"It was not a man, Jim. It was a young and beautiful woman. For coolness
  and courage I never saw her equal. With a confederate like that I should die
  a millionaire. And she knew all about me, too. Turned me inside out, and
  dismissed me like a discharged butler who had been stealing the old
  port."</p>

  <p>"I should have enjoyed that," Macgregor grinned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no you wouldn't," Price said drily. "You would have been precious
  glad to get away. But the time has not been wasted."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed. What else do you call it, then?"</p>

  <p>"Well spent. I don't know what the young lady's game is, but I mean to
  find out. I tell you she knew all about me; she asked questions about my past
  that fairly startled me. But I am not going to say anything about that
  because it's my secret. And she told me a thing that I should never have
  guessed. She asked me if I knew anything about Graham Minter."</p>

  <p>"If you don't know anything about him, who does?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. And what do you think Miss Beaumont&mdash;I drink her health
  in the spirit&mdash;suggested? That Minter had got me put away with Ericsson
  for his accomplice."</p>

  <p>Macgregor whistled thoughtfully. Certainly the suggestion had never
  occurred to him, but when the point was considered it looked extremely
  likely.</p>

  <p>"Easy to find out," he suggested. "I'll run Ericsson down for you."</p>

  <p>"And make him tell the truth. But that accomplished and beautiful young
  lady went further. I was brought up to London to give certain evidence in a
  case concerning the Certified Company in which Minter is deeply interested.
  For some reason or another I was removed from the hands of the police. Who
  by, and why? Why, by Minter's creatures so that I should not give evidence.
  And Minter is going to pay for this."</p>

  <p>"Don't you go doing anything rash," Macgregor urged.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll bide my time! We'll drag the truth out of Ericsson, and then
  we'll tackle Minter. He shall pay for this. Fancy that man living in Park
  Lane and me like this!"</p>

  <p>Price regarded his seedy garments with disdain. Macgregor laughed.</p>

  <p>"I was past Minter's house as I came here," he said. "Lights all over the
  place. A big dinner to a lot of swells, including a German Prince. And a few
  years ago Minter was sweeping out a store in Cape Town! Let's go back that
  way and see if the Dukes are still there. I'd give a trifle for a chance to
  have the run of that house."</p>

  <p>Park Lane was fairly quiet and most of the houses in darkness. But in the
  big marble-fronted palace that Minter called his own, lights were blazing and
  the big doors stood open. There were three houses together there equidistant,
  all of them of the same type, speaking of wealth and prosperity, and
  appealing to the envy of the passers-by.</p>

  <p>"That's the drawing-room," Macgregor whispered, as he pointed to a row of
  brilliantly-illuminated windows. "And on the other side is the big
  smoking-room, where Minter does all his home correspondence and sees his
  visitors and business friends. I've got a plan of the house somewhere, with
  all the places marked where the treasures are."</p>

  <p>"How did you manage to get that?" Price asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, I made it myself. Minter's South African collection is unique. He
  asked the Press to go and see the show a year ago, and I went as an American
  journalist. There's a case of unset stones in the corner of the morning-room
  that sets my mouth watering as I think of it. If I could only shovel that lot
  into my pocket I could stand a whole season in Paris and ruffle with the best
  of them. But the thing wants a bit of scheming."</p>

  <p>Price admitted the fact sadly. By the shadows moving across the blinds it
  was evident that the dinner guests had not all departed. Probably there was a
  financial genius or two there working up some brilliant scheme for the
  lightening of fools' pockets. Late as it was, a messenger boy came up the
  front steps with a letter to deliver. A few minutes later and a slouching
  figure in a soft hat and overcoat with the collar pulled high up emerged into
  the street.</p>

  <p>"Evidently a valuable tip," Price sneered, "or he wouldn't wrap up a night
  like this. Perhaps it is the German Prince who&mdash;what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Macgregor had gripped his companion's arm tightly.</p>

  <p>"Prince be hanged," he whispered. "Can't you recognize the bit of a limp
  and the stiff neck? The man in the overcoat is nobody but Graham Minter
  himself!"</p>

  <p>Macgregor spoke no more than the truth. The figure shuffling away in the
  darkness was Minter sure enough. His call must have been very important to
  draw him away from his guests like this; also he could not be going far, or
  he would have dismissed those visitors before he left the house.</p>

  <p>"I'm losing my powers of observation," Price growled. "Nothing makes you
  more dull than a few months on the wrong side of a brick wall. Let's follow
  him."</p>

  <p>Macgregor agreed, but not with enthusiasm. He had been walking a long time
  now, and his system seemed to need refreshment of a liquid nature. But all
  the houses of entertainment were closed now, and there was no chance of that
  for some time to come. Minter's errand was evidently secretive, for he
  preferred to walk instead of taking a cab as he would have done under
  ordinary circumstances. He turned presently into Oxford Street, and finally
  into a narrow thoroughfare behind the nest of squares beyond Green
  Street.</p>

  <p>He came at length to a place the front door of which was not closed, the
  gas still flared in the fanlight, and Minter entered. Macgregor knew all
  about the place as usual. It was a lodging-house of none too high a type,
  much frequented by foreigners who moved usually under the eyes of the police.
  Minter was not very long, for he emerged presently, buttoning up his coat as
  he came out.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye upon him," Macgregor said. "I'll just step inside and ask
  for my friend, Count Duvest. No such person exists, but that will make my
  task all the easier. As it's our own way, we can follow Minter home, so that
  no harm comes to him."</p>

  <p>Macgregor swaggered into the house to return a moment later with a broad
  grin of triumph on his face. He had evidently discovered something.</p>

  <p>"My friend was not there," he said. "There was only one man in the
  coffee-room, and he was just putting up some papers, so obviously he was the
  object of Minter's coming here. And that man is staying in the house. Bet you
  a shilling you can't guess who the man was."</p>

  <p>Price smote his thigh, he uttered a ferocious oath of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Done," he cried. "The man is Ericsson for a million! We are getting
  on."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR</h2>

  <p class="first">MINTER turned into his house in due course, heedless of the
  fact that he had been so closely shadowed. He had not been gone long enough
  for his presence to be missed, for he came as far as the hall door presently
  in full evening-dress, to speed a little knot of guests who departed noisily.
  Minter stood looking down the street after his friends had disappeared with
  an air of expecting somebody. A tall, well-set figure came down the Lane, and
  Minter smiled as the figure stopped.</p>

  <p>"So you changed your mind," he said, in his strident voice. "Come along
  in. I have sent the servants up to bed. We can thrash the matter out over a
  whisky and soda."</p>

  <p>The speech was plain to the pair of listeners on the other side of the
  Lane. The big door closed upon the brilliant stream of light, there was the
  sound of a sliding bolt.</p>

  <p>"We're getting into it thick to-night," Price muttered. "Yon was my
  barrister friend, the man who let me hide in his chambers and depart without
  a sign."</p>

  <p>"What, the man who was going to upset Minter's case for him&mdash;the
  young lady told you of?"</p>

  <p>"That's the joker. What does he want here?"</p>

  <p>"Why, come to square the case, of course," Macgregor muttered. "Honesty!
  Bah, what's honesty? All right if it pays, and safe because it don't get you
  into trouble. But fortunes ain't made that way. Desborough's going to square
  the case for a pot of money."</p>

  <p>Price was inclined to agree, or why had not Desborough handed him over to
  the police? There was some deep rascality here that might be discovered and
  turned to money. Price looked longingly up at the two gleaming windows at one
  end of the balcony. The rest of the house was in darkness now.</p>

  <p>"They've gone into the smoking-room," he muttered. "The windows are open
  too. I'd give a trifle to find myself in that balcony."</p>

  <p>"Don't see how it's going to be managed," said Macgregor.</p>

  <p>"Not unless we had the key of the next door premises," Price reflected.
  "Blinds all down from top to bottom, windows papered up, family away from
  home. Caretaker evidently lives in the basement and probably sleeps in the
  attic."</p>

  <p>"Old woman," Macgregor supplemented, "and a little inclined to beer. Bless
  you, I know all about it. House belongs to some big foreign financier who
  couldn't come over to England this season because of affairs. They say it is
  a grand house inside."</p>

  <p>"Well, we're going inside to see," said Price doggedly. "Those big houses
  are like ladies' jewel bags, patent locks, and all that, whilst a sixpenny
  penknife can do all the mischief. Bet you what you like there's only a bolt
  and a catch on the basement door. If we had that pretty little screw jemmy of
  yours we'd be inside in less than a minute."</p>

  <p>Macgregor chuckled, and tapped his pocket significantly.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say you've got it?" Price said hoarsely. "Down you
  go."</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for violence, however, as Price's cynical prophecy
  was verified to the letter. A window in the basement was only partially
  latched, and a pocket knife pushed the hasp back easily. A minute later and
  the two marauders were ascending the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Not even so much as a door locked," Macgregor chuckled. "You can light a
  match, eh? Thanks to all those papers posted about not a glimmer will show.
  There's no danger whatever until we come to open the drawing-room window that
  leads to the balcony. Look at this!"</p>

  <p>Everything on the landing and in the drawing-room was swathed in holland
  covers. Macgregor pulled one of them aside and disclosed a magnificent Louis
  Quinze cabinet in ebony and ivory, a work of art that might have been worth
  anything up to ten thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"Pity these things are too hot to handle," he said significantly. "We'll
  collect a few trifles as we return by way of a souvenir of our visit. Plate
  sure to be in the bank."</p>

  <p>The far drawing-room window opened easily and noiselessly, and the two
  marauders crept cautiously out on to the balcony. It was an easy matter to
  pass from one balcony to the other, seeing that there was only a low
  ornamental rail between. The brilliant gleam of the electric lights made a
  deep shadow outside the smoking-room windows, and here Price and his
  companion crouched and listened. The blind was up slightly, and the window
  open, so that it was possible to get a peep of the interior.</p>

  <p>Minter was lounging in a big armchair in the centre of the room, a huge
  cigar was between his teeth, and he smoked in a worrying manner that strongly
  reminded the spectators of a bull terrier gnawing at a bone. Clifford
  Desborough stood before the fireplace, cold and self-contained. He had a
  cigarette between his lips, but it was dead and cold. Minter's strident voice
  was booming.</p>

  <p>"Take me for a fool!" he said. "Not an inch do I go back on what I said.
  If I am ruined&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest need for you to be ruined, Minter," Desborough
  said, "seeing that the witness you had the most reason to dread has
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Price," Minter said carelessly. "But there's Ericsson and
  others. You can see your way to smash up my case, I can read it in your
  face."</p>

  <p>"And supposing I can see my way to smash you up?" Desborough asked the
  question quite coolly. Minter looked up and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I could prove that you had a hand in Price's disappearance?"
  Desborough continued. "Would you be surprised if I told you that Price had
  been to my chambers to-night and that I could put my hand upon him at any
  moment I choose? If I do that and my duty afterwards, exit Minter. You would
  go down like scores of other financial comets that I could name. What
  then?"</p>

  <p>Minter flicked off the end of his cigar on the carpet transported from an
  Indian palace.</p>

  <p>"I should be ruined," he said, "but you would be ruined, too. I might rise
  again with my brains and audacity. But you would be a bankrupt; you could
  never take a high place in politics again. No, on the whole my position is
  far better than yours."</p>

  <p>"You take a cool view of it," Desborough cried, stung to passion.</p>

  <p>"Because I know the world, my boy," Minter said. "And I know <i>you</i>.
  It's only a question of time. Pay me what you now owe me, and you are free.
  But you can't pay me the money, and you are not going to give up your career.
  You are going to marry a rich wife, but you can hardly hope to lay your hands
  on Miss Maude Beaumont's fortune before she is Mrs. Desborough."</p>

  <p>Price chuckled softly. He had heard a great deal in the last few moments.
  It would be no fault of his if this information did not prove of the greatest
  value. He had heard practically all that he wanted to learn, and there was no
  reason to remain there any longer. Those two men would go on arguing in a
  circle, but Minter Would get the upper hand in the end.</p>

  <p>"Let's get away," Price whispered. "My luck's too good to be played with.
  Besides if some meddlesome policeman goes down the area and finds the window
  unlatched&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut it," Macgregor chuckled. "I take no risks of that kind. But I'm
  hungry and thirsty, and I should like a smoke. I know of a little place not
  far off where we can get all we want in that line and a bed into the bargain.
  Lead the way."</p>

  <p>They were safely back in the house again, and the window carefully
  fastened. Macgregor struck a match and looked about him. A cabinet on slender
  gilt legs seemed to take his fancy. He slipped the cover off and looked into
  the cabinet, something ragged yet glittering under plate glass. The sight of
  it seemed to fascinate him beyond power of speech.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it all about?" asked Price impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Minter's collection of uncut stones," Macgregor said at length. "This is
  the very collection I told you about. I'll swear to them anywhere. Look at
  that ruby!"</p>

  <p>"Rot!" Price grunted contemptuously. "It must be a copy or something of
  that kind."</p>

  <p>"I'll swear to the stuff," was Macgregor's reply. "Pull out the lower
  case. In the centre you'll see a big ruby with pure gold threads all over it.
  If you don't find this, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price pulled at the drawer, and looked at its contents with wolfish
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Right you are," he muttered. "Now what is the meaning of this little
  game?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. A PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">MACGREGOR was trembling from head to foot with the
  excitement of his find. Visions of gorgeous days and still more gorgeous
  nights in Paris rose before his mind. He had only to cram one of his pockets
  with a handful or two of the uncut stones and the future would not trouble
  him for some time to come. The thing was deliciously easy and safe, too. Once
  the stones had changed hands they would immediately be cut and recognition
  rendered impossible. In all probability the gems would be on the market
  before they were missed.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange," said Price, who was keeping a cool head, "very
  strange. You have proved to me that these things belong to Graham
  Minter."</p>

  <p>"Used to belong," Macgregor chuckled. "Thousands of pounds there, my boy.
  Just make a rough division and we'll be off. Personally, I should like the
  big ruby, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not going to touch a stone," Price said slowly and thoughtfully.
  "We are going away from here leaving things exactly as we found them. You are
  all very well in your way, James, but your vision is limited. What you lack
  is education. You are going to grasp at a few hundreds, man, and lose the
  chance of thousands in the future."</p>

  <p>Macgregor looked wonderingly at his companion. Price was long-headed, and
  his words generally worthy of attention. Some scheme had come to him.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Macgregor growled. "Get it off your chest."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to. It doesn't matter two hangs to us how those stones got
  here. Suffice it to know that they belong to Graham Minter, and that we found
  them in the house of a foreign financier who is not residing here at present.
  If this means anything, it means a mystery worth sifting. For the present we
  can come here when we like. Don't imagine that nobody comes here who has a
  stake in the house, because that's a mistake. Whoever is at the bottom of
  this thing feels safe, or those stones would never be where they are. But if
  we take the stones our birds will be alarmed, and our chance of getting here
  again small. We are coming again and again, until we get to the bottom of
  this thing, and there's a fortune in it. Don't imagine that you are going to
  be allowed to spoil everything because you are breaking your neck to get to
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"Have your own way," Macgregor growled, "only get me out of this, or I
  shall be hitting you a crack over the head and levanting with the spoil. A
  bird in the hand, you know."</p>

  <p>Price clapped his hand over Macgregor's mouth suddenly. Silently he
  pointed to the door. It was wide open, and gave on to a long corridor, at the
  end of which a figure appeared with a lighted candle in his hand. Macgregor
  just caught sight of a black suit and the flash of a wide expanse of white
  shirt front. Evidently there had been no alarm, for the man with the candle
  was coming along leisurely enough towards the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Somebody living in the house," Macgregor muttered.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Price whispered. "Pick up those two wax matches off the
  floor. You fool, you might just as well leave your visiting cards about. Get
  under the holland wrap around that big cabinet and hide there. I can squeeze
  under the table."</p>

  <p>The intruders popped out of sight like two scared rabbits. By cautiously
  lifting up the edges of the wrappers they could make out the features of the
  man with the candle. It was Graham Minter, a fact that filled Macgregor with
  astonishment, but that merely caused Price to smile with the self-satisfied
  smirk of one who has seen his plans flourishing.</p>

  <p>He came along to the cabinet of stones and glanced at them casually. Then
  he deposited a small casket on the mantelshelf, covering it over with a piece
  of newspaper. His features were dark and sombre, and not quite devoid of
  anxiety. With a keen glance around him he went slowly out of the room again.
  Price was after him almost before he had gained the corridor. On his hands
  and knees the ex-convict watched. Minter turned to the right and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's odd," Macgregor said, as he followed close behind. "The
  corridor simply ends in a big window, and there is no door at all. And yet
  the man's gone utterly."</p>

  <p>Price made no reply. He had his own ideas, but for the present he was not
  sharing them with his companion. All the same Macgregor was telling no more
  than the truth. Minter seemed to have vanished through the wall. There were
  large pictures at regular intervals in deep gold frames, apparently let into
  the wall like panels. By their general appearance they had been there a long
  time.</p>

  <p>"Bought with the property," Macgregor explained. "I know all about it. The
  late Lord Bryuder sold the lot."</p>

  <p>"Not this one," Price said curtly. "This is a Velasquez, and it only came
  from Rome two years ago. Let's make a close examination of this chap."</p>

  <p>With the aid of half a box of matches Price did so. The work took time,
  but it led to a satisfactory result at length. A small portion of the frame
  looked as if it had been restored. Price fumbled at this until the picture
  gave a queer crack, and slowly swung back, leaving a passage behind. There
  was a lurid light of triumph in Price's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let's make sure of the catch," he said. "We may want to come back this
  way presently. Look, here is a picture on either side of the panel, so that
  there is nothing to disclose the fact that there is a door. 'Portrait of a
  gentleman by Velasquez.' A very good idea, Mr. Minter. Now you see, my dear
  James, how foolish it would have been to put up with those stones and ruin a
  secret that may put Mr. Graham Minter's fortune in our hands. Yes, the door
  opens the same way back and front. Let's go and investigate, comfortable in
  the knowledge that all the servants have gone to bed.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Price whispered, as the liquid notes of a piano flooded the
  house. "I thought Lady Mary Minter was down at Marvyn Chase."</p>

  <p>The mystery was explained presently by a peep into the smoking-room. The
  magnificent piece of music was being played by Minter on the pianola. For the
  moment he seemed to have forgotten everything else. Price touched Macgregor
  lightly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Your sight is better than mine," he whispered. "Who is that writing at
  the table by the wall?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Ericsson, of course. Shut up, can't you. Minter has finished his
  music."</p>

  <p>Minter rolled up the Nocturne of Chopin, and closed down the lid of the
  pianola with a bang.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had learnt music as a boy," he said. "I should have devoted
  myself to it, and never have been worried as I am at present. You are sure
  that Isaacson is coming?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure, sir," Ericsson said, in his fawning voice. "He was only
  waiting for the girls. The thing was certain to be settled."</p>

  <p>Minter paced up and down the room in an agitated manner. All his brutal
  audacity seemed to have deserted him, he looked like a criminal awaiting the
  verdict of the jury. There were spirit decanters on the table, and more than
  once he fingered them irresolutely. Then with a sort of self-contempt he
  turned away and resumed his walk again.</p>

  <p>"You know what you have got to do," he said. "Step out directly the Jew
  comes and hide behind the screen. You are to take down every word you hear,
  and be careful not to make mistakes. Is it my fancy, or did I hear the bell
  down below?" Ericsson rose from his writing and crossed to the door. The two
  intruders had barely time to step into the darkness of the next room before
  Ericsson was in the corridor. They could hear Minter in the smoking-room
  striding about and muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>"A man or a mouse," he said. "A month hence a millionaire in very sooth or
  a pauper&mdash;aye, something worse. Which is it to be? I have my treasure,
  my precious treasure. And my uncut stones that they speak of so highly. I
  should like to see the face of the thief who stole them and tried to sell
  them in Amsterdam. I should like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The prospect seemed to please Minter, for he broke off and laughed aloud.
  Price grasped Macgregor by the arm as he choked down a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Who was right?" he whispered. "We shall do better than fill our pockets
  with those stones."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. THE BYNGTON JEWELS</h2>

  <p class="first">MACGREGOR grinned uneasily. He had not quite abandoned all
  ideas of looting the uncut stones, but he was bound to recognize the superior
  wisdom of Price's policy. Footsteps were creeping up the stairs now, and
  Ericsson appeared, followed by a little man with a bent form and a cough that
  proclaimed the fact that the owner was not much longer for this world. Yet
  his dark eyes were not dimmed, and the greed glittered in them as it had done
  any time the last half century.</p>

  <p>"Your humble servant, Mr. Minter," he said with a cringing bow. "You sent
  for me, I think."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," Minter said brutally. "I never sent for you, and you know
  it. When you have anything particularly good you come to me because I can get
  you a much better price than anybody else. I got your message to-night, and
  that is why I am waiting up to see you."</p>

  <p>Every word of the conversation was quite plain to the two intruders
  listening in the next room. The little Jew writhed and chuckled as if Minter
  had perpetrated some unusually good joke.</p>

  <p>"Stop it!" Minter cried. "Get to business, Isaacson. Let's hear what you
  have to say."</p>

  <p>The two listeners would have exchanged glances only the darkness prevented
  it. More than once they had had the kindly assistance of Israel Isaacson in
  disposing of valuable but dangerous property. The Jew was pouring himself out
  something to drink by the sound.</p>

  <p>"I can't be bullied," he said. "This dreadful cough of mine&mdash;oh,
  dear, dear. My dear sir, I have been reading the papers lately, some of the
  papers that deal in gossip. In one of them there was an article on the Earl
  of Byngton's jewels. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Met him," Minter said coolly. "A young fool who was intended by Nature to
  be a woman. Dyes, powders, and wears stays and all that. Ought to be licked,
  the young cub. They say that he always carries a small fortune in gems about
  him."</p>

  <p>Isaacson chuckled again. Minter followed as patiently as he could.</p>

  <p>"So he does, so he does," he whispered. "Fond of theatrical company, going
  behind the scenes, and all that. Very fond of champagne, too."</p>

  <p>"Drinking himself to death, if that is what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Well, well; we need not be too hard on the follies of that young man.
  Where would some of the pretty fortunes come from if there were not foolish
  young men? And the late Earl was not much better, only he took the precaution
  of having copies of all his gems made. I know that because a young friend of
  mine got possession of the copies."</p>

  <p>"Ah," Minter exclaimed. He was interested now. "That is very curious. Go
  on, Israel."</p>

  <p>"My young friend gets the copies. He is a wise young man and says nothing.
  Maybe those copies may prove useful some day. The copies came into the hands
  of a lady not entirely unconnected with the music-hall stage. She is not a
  star, but she has powerful friends, who can push her, and get her picture in
  the illustrated papers. Yesterday's <i>Lorgnette,</i> for instance, had a
  portrait."</p>

  <p>"You need not mention any names, Israel. I&mdash;er&mdash;take the
  <i>Lorgnette</i> in regularly."</p>

  <p>"What a pleasure to do business with a man who has a luminous mind!"
  Isaacson cried, in a kind of rapture.</p>

  <p>"On that point no more need be said. Lord Byngton, he takes his jewels to
  a little supper party, and they go round freely. Presently one or two of the
  ladies of that party go away and the jewels are still circulated. Would it
  not be strange when Lord Byngton wakes up sober in the morning for him to
  discover that he had not got the gems but the paste? At so large a party the
  culprit would be difficult to discover, eh?"</p>

  <p>Minter nodded, and his deep-set eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"What has all this got to do with me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing," the Jew hastened to say. "It only struck me as a
  clever plot for a novel or a little scheme that might be worked successfully
  by a financier. Not for a moment would any of the people I mention think of
  robbing his lordship in that way."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Minter growled. "It seems to me you are wasting my
  time."</p>

  <p>"For which a thousand pardons, my dear sir. What I came to say was this.
  The young lady whose portrait appears in this week's <i>Lorgnette,</i> also a
  friend of hers, similarly favoured, have had misfortunes. They possess gems
  of historic value. Whence these gems come does not matter. You are prepared
  to purchase such gems. The young ladies would like to see you&mdash;in fact,
  they are waiting at the corner of the Lane in a cab for that very purpose.
  The price is ten thousand."</p>

  <p>"And your commission of course. If the young ladies are not afflicted by
  undue shyness let them come here. But as to cash, I am particularly short of
  it at present. You can have two £250 shares in the Certified Company for your
  commission, which is as good as ready money and much safer to handle than a
  cheque. I could pay the girls in the same manner, and every share that they
  hold could be sold at a premium to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Isaacson nodded. He had a pretty poor opinion of Certified Shares, and his
  own views as to the financial soundness of his present host, but Certifieds
  were good for the present, and the Jew would lose no time in turning them
  into cash.</p>

  <p>"You would like to see the young ladies," he said eagerly. "Very good. I
  will send them here. As to myself I will not return, the air is not good for
  my cough. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Isaacson bowed respectfully, but there was a strange gleam in his dark
  eyes as he went down the thickly-carpeted stairs. There would be a mighty
  smash here some of these days, but that mattered little to the Jew so long as
  his share of the plunder was safe. Minter paced up and down the room
  restlessly till the sound of high-pitched voices broke on the ear and the
  room gradually filled with a powerful odour of perfumes. The girls were
  handsome enough in a hard, bold kind of way, nor were they a bit abashed by
  the luxury of their surroundings.</p>

  <p>"So you are here again," Minter smiled. "'Pon my word, you both of you
  wear very well. How many years is it since I was doing baggage man and you
  were both playing in Lenzo's stock company at Cape Town?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," the taller of the two girls laughed. "Actresses
  never grow old. And don't forget that you are going to take us on the river
  from Reading to-morrow and to your place to tea afterwards."</p>

  <p>Minter admitted that he had forgotten all about the promise. Lady Mary was
  at Marvyn Chase to-morrow, but she was lunching out and would not be back
  till late.</p>

  <p>"So we'll risk it," he said cheerfully. "I've got a weekend party, but a
  telegram or two will keep all off the premises till after six. Meanwhile a
  little bird tells me that you two girls have got a pleasant little surprise
  for me."</p>

  <p>The taller of the two girls laid a packet done up roughly in tissue paper
  on the table, and Minter gave a casual glance at the inside. Just for a
  moment the room was filled with a dazzling stream of liquid fire, then Minter
  crushed the glittering mass in his ponderous hand and thrust it deeply down
  in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Pretty," he said carelessly, "very pretty indeed. I'll look at it when I
  have time. Meanwhile I am going to give you a little present each which I
  will post to-night to your rooms. A letter for each of you with a few little
  shares in it, shares that you can take to your broker and coin into hard
  money. Won't that be nice?"</p>

  <p>The girls giggled and dexterously began to talk about something else.
  Ericsson appeared presently and the visitors, with many shy suggestions as to
  the outing for the morrow, went away. Minter's face grew dark and troubled
  again as he saw them depart.</p>

  <p>"Clear up and be off," he said to Ericsson. "I want to be alone; I have
  work to do yet. And mind you keep sober after Sunday, at any rate. If you
  don't I'll lay you by the heels as sure as you are a living man!"</p>

  <p>Ericsson muttered something and departed. Minter poured himself out a
  strong glass of brandy and tossed it off as if it had been so much water.</p>

  <p>"It's a foolish thing to do!" he muttered, "but my nerves are not what
  they were!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>XXVII. NEWS FROM ABROAD</h2>

  <p class="first">WAS it a man of iron or a man of straw who stood there
  clinking the glass against his teeth? Whatever he might be on the morrow
  Minter was utterly unnerved for the moment.</p>

  <p>The man was playing a desperate game, he stood just on the verge of ruin,
  a state of affairs fondly imagined to be known to nobody with the exception
  of a tool or two whom he could have crushed at the first sign of
  indiscretion.</p>

  <p>The man was an adventurer playing a desperate game. The very splendour of
  his appointments and his reputed wealth kept creditors at bay. Tradesmen who
  would have hung on to him like a leech if they had known the true state of
  affairs, fawned at his feet now and thrust their wares upon him. And yet on
  the other hand the phantom millions would be no phantom at all if all went
  well with the Certified Company shares. It was a pure matter of bluff. But if
  those shares went the way of so many of them, then Minter would be something
  worse than a bankrupt.</p>

  <p>He held himself to be no worse than many he knew. Other millionaires, now
  in a safe position, had risked the chances of a gaol and now stood firm on a
  solid financial footing.</p>

  <p>But Minter looked ahead. If the crash came the police would seek in vain
  for him. He would disappear in such a way that the authorities could never
  find him. He would take with him enough money to give most men a fortune. It
  was a wonderfully elaborate yet beautifully simple scheme, but it was to be
  avoided if possible.</p>

  <p>It was well for Minter that he knew many capitals in Europe and spoke many
  languages. Most people would have been astonished to find how many languages
  Minter knew. But he kept this fact to himself.</p>

  <p>But for the moment he was beaten; he realized that he was not quite the
  man of three years ago. Nothing soothed his nerves like music, the pianola
  was a great solace to him. He shut off the lights now and played something
  dreamy in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't we better clear out?" Macgregor suggested in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Price replied between his teeth. "So long as we know how to
  find our way into the house next door we are safe. I've found out a great
  deal, but I am not yet satisfied. Fancy the very man that Minter has the most
  reason to dread hearing all this! We shan't want to work any more, Jim. If
  Minter pulls through, as he probably will, you and I will be in clover."</p>

  <p>But Macgregor was getting restless and uneasy. So far their luck had been
  wonderfully good, so good that it seemed a pity to unduly strain it. The
  house was very quiet now, with nothing but the soft, liquid tones of the
  pianola to break the silence. Minter might have been a white-souled,
  pure-minded artist with nothing to worry about. The weird music stopped at
  length, and in the stillness that followed the click of a latchkey could be
  heard.</p>

  <p>Somebody came slightly wheezing up the stairs as Price stepped back into
  the black shadow of the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>"Bigglestone!" Price murmured. "All the army has been here to-night. This
  is the first lieutenant, Jim. We are going to hear something more."</p>

  <p>The pianola began again with something dreamy of Beethoven's. Bigglestone
  struck in without ceremony. "Put that up, sir," he said. "and let's have a
  light. I've got news for you."</p>

  <p>"To the dickens with you and your news!" Minter cried passionately, though
  he turned from his instrument and switched on the lights again. "Everybody
  has been here but you, and it's bad all along the line. Have you just come
  back from Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Straight here, sir. And I have had a travelling companion."</p>

  <p>"Don't speak in enigmas, but get to the point. Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"You will never guess. What do you say to the Countess de Lary?"</p>

  <p>A furious oath burst from Minter's lips. He raged up and down the room
  white and furious. He was in the mood that finds vent in breaking things.</p>

  <p>"Plague take the woman!" he said between his teeth. "What on earth does
  she want here? She used to say that she would never come to England
  again."</p>

  <p>"Well, she is looking after Baron Kinski, who, she says, robbed her of
  half a million francs in Vienna five years ago. I pointed out the fact that
  the courts had acquitted the Baron even in his absence, and that he had gone
  to America to look after the very interests that so concerned her. As you
  know, Baron Kinski is a man who likes to keep his movements secret."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Minter said with a grin. "I know the rascal well. Funny
  thing that he should have taken the house next door to me, Bigglestone. If he
  happens to come to England when the Countess is here there is likely to be a
  scene or two. Is she as flighty as ever?"</p>

  <p>"Worse," said Bigglestone. "More talk and more dye and powder. She's
  changed the colour of her hair and looks like a girl of eighteen. But she's
  found something out; I don't know what, but she's found something out. I
  could see that from the queer look in her eyes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! You must pump her, Bigglestone. Pose also as a victim of the
  Baron."</p>

  <p>"That I did, of course. But, despite her Mighty ways, the old girl is
  mighty cunning. If she hasn't come to England with some big card to play, I'm
  much mistaken. No man can guard against everything. If she finds out that you
  are connected with the Baron&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My good Bigglestone, that is impossible."</p>

  <p>"It looks so upon the face of it," Bigglestone said thoughtfully. "But you
  never can tell. There is nothing in the world to equal a good piece of
  bluff."</p>

  <p>"Kinski never had his portrait taken," Minter said suddenly. He did not
  appear to be following the conversation of his companion at all. "He was
  always reticent."</p>

  <p>"Granted. But there are clever artists who get big prices for the pictures
  of celebrities. In Vienna Kinski kept to himself, even his clerks hardly knew
  him by sight. An editor would have paid a large figure for a good sketch. And
  Manton the caricaturist got one. For once he made no use of his comic powers;
  he made a faithful likeness, which was reproduced in the Vienna
  <i>Poste</i>."</p>

  <p>Minter nodded thoughtfully. His mind seemed to be very far away.</p>

  <p>"That was before Kinski shaved his beard and moustache," he said. "I fancy
  that nobody in Vienna saw the Baron after he had shaved. I kept a copy of
  that particular issue of the <i>Poste</i> by me for some time; indeed I only
  parted with it to-night."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," Bigglestone asked, with a startled expression. "To whom?"</p>

  <p>"To Ericsson. The man has a sober fit on him and I am making him useful.
  He has a genius for figures and I am getting him to look at the statistics of
  those 'silver' shares we had a go at five years ago when we were at a loose
  end in Europe. The figures were all in the <i>Poste</i>."</p>

  <p>"And Ericsson has got the lot, including the one with the picture of the
  Baron in it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's so. But that need not concern <i>us</i>."</p>

  <p>Bigglestone muttered something that the listeners outside could not catch.
  Minter brought his fist crashing down on a table and his big hoarse voice
  rang out passionately.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten it," he cried, "quite forgotten it. I believe my mind's
  going, Bigglestone; there is such a tremendous deal to think about. But you
  can get that paper back. 10th December, '97, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's so. I've got good reason to remember the date. Give me
  Ericsson's address."</p>

  <p>Minter scribbled the desired information on a piece of paper, and
  Bigglestone rose. For once Minter seemed reluctant to be left alone.</p>

  <p>"Where are you of to in such a hurry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Going to look up Ericsson at once. He won't be gone to bed; he was always
  the sort that sit up half the night and sleep half the day. There's no time
  to be lost."</p>

  <p>Bigglestone nodded and passed out of the room. There was a sullen thud of
  the front door and then the house was silent once more.</p>

  <p>"The best thing I can do," Minter said, half-aloud, "is to go to bed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>XXVIII. A FOREIGN NEWSPAPER</h2>

  <p class="first">PRICE grasped the arm of his companion in a vice-like grip
  and hurried off along the corridor. On the thick Persian carpet their feet
  made no sound. The portrait of the gentleman by Velasquez swung back on
  well-oiled hinges without a sound, and the next house was gained again.</p>

  <p>"What's the game now?" Macgregor growled. "How you do get on one's nerves
  to be sure."</p>

  <p>"The night's work is nearly finished," Price said, in a deep, hoarse
  whisper. "And a good night's work it has been. One more little thing to do
  and we are safe. Bigglestone must not go to Ericsson's quarters yet. He must
  be prevented by force if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you think you have found something out, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think anything about it, Jim. I've made a discovery that causes
  my head to swim. But you're not going to know anything about that yet because
  you are not always discreet. Get a move on you. We have to overtake
  Bigglestone and keep him quiet for the time."</p>

  <p>They were safely out in the fresh air again, not a soul in sight; there
  was no sound beyond the beat of a heavy footstep down the Lane. Macgregor lit
  a cigarette and inhaled the smoke with genuine delight. Price dragged him
  forward impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That's right," he said. "Lose the chance of a lifetime for the sake of a
  cigarette not worth a farthing. I have spotted my man, I know that heavy
  tread of his. We'll overtake him, and when we get alongside ask him a
  question. The rest you can leave to me."</p>

  <p>"Sounds risky," said Macgregor, whose physical courage was not a strong
  point. "In the open street I don't think I should dare."</p>

  <p>"Dare! I'd dare anything with such a prize in my grasp&mdash;murder even.
  I shall wait my time, have no fear on that score. Come along and talk. You
  can talk fast enough as a rule. Act the giddy goat coming home from a party
  so that our man can't suspect."</p>

  <p>Macgregor was chatting in a nervous, highly-pitched voice as the pair drew
  near to Bigglestone. As they were close up Price dropped a little behind. He
  had no mind to be recognized, seeing that Bigglestone and he were old
  acquaintances. The remark did not apply to Macgregor.</p>

  <p>"Keep it up," Price said hoarsely. "Between the next two lamps. It's safe
  now."</p>

  <p>Bigglestone plodded along without any suspicions whatever. If he did give
  a passing thought to the couple behind him it was merely to wonder whether
  they had been dining out or not. Price and his companion parted, one ranging
  up on either side of the victim. Macgregor slightly brushed against him and
  begged his pardon in a tone that suggested a more than usually good
  dinner.</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," Bigglestone said shortly. "I have been like that."</p>

  <p>He got no further. From behind Price dealt him a murderous blow under the
  ear. A few stars danced before the eyes of the victim, he reeled, and fell
  full length on the pavement snoring aloud. For the moment he was quite
  knocked out of time.</p>

  <p>"You didn't half do that," Macgregor said, with chattering teeth.</p>

  <p>"There was a deal of interest to pay off as well as the debt," Price
  muttered. "That'll do for the present. A policeman will pick him up and take
  him off in the ambulance under the impression that he is drunk. The police
  always think that when they find a poor fellow unconscious in the street. By
  the time Bigglestone is in possession of his senses again I shall have
  finished my business with Ericsson."</p>

  <p>"In the coffee-room," Macgregor said, as the two hurried along. "First
  door on the right. On the whole I had better not come along, eh?"</p>

  <p>Price nodded. He had not the least intention of taking Macgregor with him.
  He pushed presently into the dingy coffee-room with the odour of stale
  tobacco and bygone meals. A sleepy waiter made no objection. In that house
  the lights were never out night or day. Suspicious characters were not
  suspicious there. The coffee-room was deserted save for Ericsson, who sat
  smoking a cigarette and making entries from some papers by his side. Price
  stepped over to him.</p>

  <p>"I want a word with you," he said. "There's no getting away from me."</p>

  <p>The pen dropped from Ericsson's nerveless hands, his white face quivered
  like features seen behind blazing spirits. In a feeble kind of way he grasped
  across the table as if feeling for a glass. But there was no glass there, and
  the man had to fall hack upon his own fleeting courage.</p>

  <p>"What do you want!" he gasped. "The people know me here, and you are a
  stranger. Any violence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price laughed.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "you are safe for the present. But for you I should
  have been a prosperous man by now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't. You would have gone too far as usual," Ericsson
  said, with some display of spirit. "I admit I served you a very bad turn,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you were under the thumb of our friend Minter. He had to put me away,
  and you were the tool used for the purpose. But that astute financier did not
  see quite far enough, and the very man he put in gaol he would have given
  thousands to see outside and away on the far side of the world. If Minter had
  known as much as he does now I should never have seen the inside of a prison.
  I should have been enjoying myself with his money out in Australia."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Ericsson asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I say. Do you suppose I don't know why I was rescued from
  the police and at whose instigation? You can tell Minter I said so. You and
  he dare not give me away. Why, I could walk into Minter's house and call for
  a bottle of champagne, and get it too! He would not dare to summon the
  police. Give him my compliments; tell him he is going to hear of me again. I
  was going to kill you to-night, but I have found something far better to
  do."</p>

  <p>Ericsson permitted himself to smile. He had been in mortal fear of this
  man, so fearful that he had not dared to move from his present quarters to
  Park Lane and back without a cab. And now, for some reason, Price had decided
  to forego his vengeance. There was a cunning twinkle in Ericsson's eyes that
  warned Price not to say too much.</p>

  <p>"But you're going to do something for me," he said. "You recollect that
  little matter of the concert we got up for a friend who, alas! is no more.
  Peace be to his ashes, for he was an engaging scoundrel. I want the list of
  patrons who took tickets&mdash;you can guess why. I know you always keep
  useful information of that kind. Have you got it?"</p>

  <p>"Upstairs in my bedroom," Ericsson replied with an effort to please. "If
  you don't mind waiting here I shall be glad to get it for you."</p>

  <p>Ericsson went away shakily. This second encounter with Price and the easy
  manner in which the latter had found him out had given him a feeling like a
  palsy. Positively he must stop at the bar and have a little glass of
  brandy.</p>

  <p>The delay was all in Price's favour. Rapidly he flung over the pile of
  copies of the Vienna <i>Poste</i> that lay on the table. He had nearly
  reached the bottom before he came upon the object of his search, a special
  issue of the paper with a portrait on the first page. It was good work by a
  good man, and capitally reproduced. Price laid it on the table flat and held
  his hand over the lower part of the face. His eyes gleamed, he thrilled with
  exultation from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"I'll cut it out," he muttered. "No, on second thoughts it would be wiser
  to take it wholesale. Never do to arouse suspicion. Hullo, you back already.
  Thanks for the list. And just you keep out of my way, for I may not always
  feel as amiable as I do now."</p>

  <p>Ericsson promised that he would do so. Evidently he was quite sincere
  about it. Price strolled into the street, where Macgregor was awaiting
  him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he said hoarsely. "Hold on, or I shall shout out the
  good news. My boy, it's a fortune; you and I are going to be millionaires.
  Never in the whole course of my life have I dropped upon so sweet and good
  thing as this!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>XXIX. THE STAR STILL SHINES</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE are haunts in London for criminals of all classes, and
  some of them by no means confined to the slums. Like most things, it was a
  mere matter of money, and Price, being by no means short of cash, and having
  excellent prospects of more to follow, chose to make himself comfortable. He
  breakfasted luxuriously in bed, he procured a stock of clothing from the
  proper quarter, and after a shave and the donning of a pair of gold-rimmed
  glasses felt himself equal to the task of facing the police under any
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>Alice he would leave alone for the present; she might draw any conclusions
  she pleased, but she would not be troubled again until she was wanted. Price
  was in blissful ignorance of the amount of information in his wife's
  possession.</p>

  <p>Neither had he told Macgregor too much. It was enough for the latter to
  know that they had practically found a gold mine. A confederate would be
  needed later, but for the present Macgregor was in ignorance of the great
  discovery. For two days Price smoked and ate and slept, slowly maturing his
  plans the while.</p>

  <p>On the third day there was a message for him that came by tortuous means.
  Miss Maude Beaumont desired to see him. She was going into the country
  to-morrow for a few days. She would be alone after dinner, when Price might
  call. He had better have a parcel of some kind, and invent some ingenious
  excuse for his visit. Maude left that to him.</p>

  <p>There was a ring of command about the letter; it was cold and
  contemptuous. All the same Price looked forward to his visit. He admired
  Maude tremendously, her beauty and courage moved him. If only Alice had been
  her sister!</p>

  <p>"I'll go," he told himself. "It's a treat to be in a decent house with a
  lady again. There are times when I'd give something to have my position once
  more."</p>

  <p>Without quite knowing it Price had fallen a victim to Maude. He was not
  fully aware how tremendously he admired her. He was a headstrong man, and his
  passions generally controlled him. His heart beat faster, his pulses thrilled
  as he stood before Maude again. She was as tranquilly beautiful and coldly
  contemptuous as ever. He would have sat down, but her glance restrained
  him.</p>

  <p>"You are wondering why I sent for you," Maude said.</p>

  <p>Price admitted the fact. Maude toyed thoughtfully with a paper knife, her
  hands flashing in the light as it caught her rings. She hardly knew how to
  begin.</p>

  <p>"Have you made any fresh discoveries?" she asked. "I told you before that
  my duty was plain. I ought to hand you over to the police."</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Price's tongue to suggest that family reasons barred
  the way. He had no idea that Maude was aware how closely he was connected
  with Alice; perhaps some day a disclosure of the fact might prove useful. But
  for the present he wanted money, a little more than he possessed. Money was
  always a useful thing to have.</p>

  <p>"What discovery do you mean?" he fenced.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there need be no disguise between us. I want to know why Mr. Minter
  desired to have you out of his way, and why Mr. Clifford Desborough shielded
  you. I may have my opinion."</p>

  <p>"Why not ask Mr. Desborough yourself?" Price suggested impudently.</p>

  <p>"I should advise you not to speak like that to me again," Maude said
  coldly. There was not the slightest suspicion of colour on her cheeks. "I
  desire to discover these things for myself. They are worth a very high figure
  to me&mdash;and you."</p>

  <p>"With something down on account!" Price suggested.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I was prepared for you to make that request. I want to know
  everything. Here are a hundred pounds for you and more to follow. Find out
  what I want, and I'll pay you £1,000. It is a disgraceful thing to do, but I
  am prepared to do it."</p>

  <p>Price's eyes glistened as he stowed away the clinking, glittering
  sovereigns. It was a pleasure to do business with a girl like this. Most of
  them would have paid in bank-notes, which are somewhat difficult to dispose
  of when a gentleman is temporarily under a cloud, and moreover notes can be
  traced. But the sovereign pays its own way and calls for no questions.</p>

  <p>"I would do anything for you," the ex-convict said fervently. It was
  evident that he spoke sincerely. "I'll find it all out, never fear; don't you
  see that I am doing your work and mine at the same time?
  Desborough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say Mr. Desborough. It sounds better and hurts my self-respect less."</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;Mr. Desborough. Well, he's under Minter's thumb. Very
  late the night before last those two had an interview at which I was
  fortunate enough to be present. They were not aware of the fact, but let that
  pass. There are wheels within wheels, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," Maude said impatiently. "I don't seek to pry into your
  disgraceful secrets. I don't doubt for a moment that you are doing two things
  at the same time."</p>

  <p>"I am that." Price's face darkened for a moment and his eyes gleamed.
  "I've got to be revenged. I'm going to take my revenge and crown it with
  gold. But that's not the point. The point is that Mr. Minter has got Mr.
  Desborough under his thumb in some way and threatens to ruin him unless he
  more or less sells his clients over the Certified Company's case."</p>

  <p>Maude nodded with her lips pressed tightly together. She had expected
  something of the kind, but not quite so bad.</p>

  <p>"Can you give me any more details?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not much at present, I am bound to confess," Price replied.
  "Minter&mdash;well, Mr. Minter&mdash;has bought up Mr. Desborough's debts and
  can make him bankrupt to-morrow, as far as I could gather. But surely, Miss
  Beaumont, if you with your money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price stopped discreetly, seeing that he was going too far. The same point
  had occurred to Maude at the same time, and the blood flamed into her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Desborough is not the kind of man to ask the favour," she said
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the suggestion thrilled her. She might buy Desborough off,
  she might release him from Minter's clutches as the price of her freedom. But
  this she could not discuss with Price. She had shame enough as it was in the
  knowledge that the ex-convict was her confederate. Still all is fair in love
  and war. Desborough had forced her into a hateful engagement, and if she
  could get out of it without her mother suffering she felt that she need have
  no scruples.</p>

  <p>"Was the discussion over certain questions to be put to a witness?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it," Price said admiringly. "I am one of the witnesses,
  and a most important one. Minter has more or less spoilt his game. If he had
  let me appear when the iron was hot and those debts were hanging over Mr.
  Desborough's head, the latter would have done what was required of him."</p>

  <p>Maude was inclined to agree with the speaker, but she was loath to confess
  it.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a poor opinion of human nature," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, I've good reason to. Mr. Desborough would have yielded, and so
  would any one, or at least nearly every one under circumstances like that. If
  you like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Maude had risen as an indication that the interview was finished. She
  wanted to be alone now, to think out the plan that Price had suggested.</p>

  <p>"That is all for the present," she said. "On the whole I am getting value
  for my money. To-morrow I go to Marvyn Chase for a few days, where you can
  write to me if you have anything fresh."</p>

  <p>Price went off downstairs a little more infatuated with Maude than ever.
  It was unfortunate, perhaps, that she failed to understand her power. But she
  had other things to occupy her mind at present&mdash;the prospect of
  freedom.</p>

  <p>"Dare I tell him what I know?" she asked herself. "Dare I open his eyes
  and make a question of money of it? He could have half my fortune, nay, he
  could have the lot of it, if he would pass his word to keep silence and leave
  me to my dear old Kit."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>XXX. GUESTS AT THE CHASE</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE turned her back upon London next morning with no
  feeling of regret. She had just had a letter from Alice, in which the latter
  said that she had not seen her husband since the night of the burglary
  fiasco, and that she hoped this condition of things was likely to last. It
  was raining too, and even the West End of London does not delight the heart
  when it is wet.</p>

  <p>With her maid Maude travelled down to Marvyn Chase. There was to be a
  brilliant Saturday to Monday gathering there and Maude had come down to
  luncheon at Lady Mary's special request. Most people spoke of Lady Mary
  Minter as a fool who had married Minter for his money at the command of her
  mother the Duchess, and for the most part they were right. But though she was
  generally a mere cypher in the house, Lady Mary had her family pride and
  there were limits beyond which even Minter dared not go. None of his choice
  spirits ever entered the house. If they did, it would mean Lady Mary
  instantly leaving it. And Minter could not afford a scandal just now.</p>

  <p>The great house seemed strangely silent as Maude entered the hall. A big
  fire flickered cheerfully on the pictures and statuary, but there was no sign
  of a visitor anywhere. Usually Lady Mary came forward to greet her own
  favoured guests.</p>

  <p>But her woman appeared in Maude's bedroom instead. Lady Mary had
  unfortunately been called away. The Duchess her mother was lunching at
  Castleton Towers, and had desired to see Lady Mary. She would be back to tea
  at the very latest.</p>

  <p>Maude dismissed the woman cheerfully. She did not in the least mind. She
  would lunch alone, and if the rain still kept on she would make a tour in the
  house in the afternoon. The place was worth more than a casual inspection.
  Maude came down into the hall presently and turned over the leaves of a book,
  waiting for the luncheon-gong to sound.</p>

  <p>A door opened somewhere, there was a rush of cool air and the sound of
  high-pitched voices. They were not such well-bred voices as they might have
  been, but they sounded easy and as if the speakers were thoroughly at home.
  But they were not Lady Mary's class, Maude told herself. Surely she of all
  women had not released the rigid rule of the house and opened the front door
  to that horrid "smart" set!</p>

  <p>But they must be visitors clearly enough, for there came the raucous sound
  of Minter's voice, a voice that seemed none too steady to Maude. The ripple
  of laughter came nearer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am all right now," a voice said. "The mackintoshes were a great
  success. Say, Nobby, this is a sight better than being on the Thames in a
  launch."</p>

  <p>Maude began to understand. These were some friends of Minter with whom he
  had been intending to spend a day on the river. The wet had stopped that and
  the master of Marvyn Chase had brought them to lunch. They were probably
  theatrical, for Minter's tastes lay in that direction, but it was pretty
  certain that they would not be here if Lady Mary had been home to luncheon.
  Maude smiled to herself as she pictured the face of her host when he caught
  sight of her.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he was saying. The flicker of the log fire touched his red
  face and watery eyes. Maude was a little disgusted and a little surprised. It
  was not strictly true to say that Graham Minter was intoxicated, but he had
  had a great deal too much champagne.</p>

  <p>"Come along, girls," he said unsteadily. "When the cat's away, you know.
  Lunch will be ready in a few minutes, and I've ordered up sortie of that '94
  you like so much. Sit down and&mdash;hullo!"</p>

  <p>Minter pulled up and stared at Maude uncomfortably. For once in his life
  he had the grace to feel thoroughly ashamed of himself. The two
  highly-coloured, yellow-haired girls exchanged glances and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I, didn't know anybody was here," Minter stammered.</p>

  <p>"I came by special request," Maude said. "I find Lady Mary has been
  compelled to go out to luncheon. But I am between your friends and the
  fire."</p>

  <p>Minter muttered something. In a clumsy way he introduced his other guests.
  He boggled over their names as he performed the ceremony, and exchanged a
  wink with them that Maude failed to see. They were not low-looking women, she
  thought, despite the horrible way they made up and the boldness of their
  manners. The elder one, whom Maude was told was Miss Sefton, she deemed
  pretty and amiable, save for a certain hardness of the eye and greedy cut of
  the mouth. They were both uneasily familiar, as if conscious that they were
  out of place here, and desirous of emphasizing the fact that they were as
  good as anybody else.</p>

  <p>"We are going to have a quick lunch, and catch the 4.15 to town," Minter
  said. He spoke thickly, and he was none too steady on his feet. For the
  thousandth time Maude caught herself wondering why Lady Mary had ever married
  such a man. "If it hadn't been for the rain we should have stayed on the
  river."</p>

  <p>There was a note of apology in the speech that was meant for Maude's ears
  alone. Minter was asking her to pardon the little indiscretion, and say
  nothing about it to Lady Mary. After all it would perhaps be as well to do
  so; no doubt the girls were honest enough in their way, and under the
  circumstances it had been more or less impossible to dispense with the
  hospitality.</p>

  <p>But the tall woman called Sefton laughingly refused to be accounted for in
  this way.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," she said. "None of that, old boy. It was part of the
  programme&mdash;the part that we looked forward to most. I'm not a Sunday
  school little girl taken into the vicarage for a treat."</p>

  <p>The other laughed, and both finished their champagne with relish. Maude
  felt a little more chilly and reserved. These visitors were drinking more
  wine than good taste or good manners called for, and as the lunch progressed
  their familiarity with Minter increased. Maude felt sincerely sorry that she
  had come, but she would have to go through with it now. The talk grew
  theatrical presently and less personal.</p>

  <p>"What theatre are you at?" Maude asked the tall woman.</p>

  <p>"One and another," she said. "I'm so popular that one theatre is not
  enough for me. And a good thing too, for money slips through my hands like
  water."</p>

  <p>"She is at the halls," the other girl said. "She's got her portrait in
  this week's <i>Lorgnette</i>."</p>

  <p>Maude bowed, but she did not quite understand. The rain had cleared off
  now, and the sun was shining again. Perhaps these strange women with their
  free speech and easy manners would leave the Chase. Maude wished that they
  did not take quite so much wine, for their faces were growing red and their
  eyes glistened. She had met many members of the profession before, but they
  did not act like these women.</p>

  <p>Lunch came to an end at length, almost as much to Minter's relief as
  Maude's. The sun was shining brilliantly now, a high-stepping dog-cart came
  up to the hall door.</p>

  <p>"There's the cart," Minter stammered. "Come along, girls. I'll drive you
  to Reading, and there will be just time to get tea there."</p>

  <p>Maude muttered something politely. She was not quite sure whether she had
  enjoyed her new companions or not, but she was certain of the fact that the
  departure of the unaccustomed guests would be a relief to her. The tall woman
  nodded in a careless fashion, and marched into the hall. Presently they had
  gone with as little ceremony as they had come.</p>

  <p>"Mum's the word," Minter whispered to Maude as he followed to the door.
  "They're not bad girls; not your form, of course, but they'll
  pass&mdash;especially Miss Sefton. All the same, I'd rather you said nothing
  to Lady Mary. If it hadn't come on to rain, you see."</p>

  <p>"Your little secret is safe with me," Maude said.</p>

  <p>The dog-cart drove away, and Maude returned to the hall. She turned over a
  pile of papers, coming presently to the <i>Lorgnette</i>. Miss Sefton's
  portrait was in here she had been told. With languid curiosity Maude
  fluttered over the highly-glazed pages.</p>

  <p>Yes, here she was, right enough; tall and fair and saucy, with a big hat
  perched on her yellow curls. Maude would have recognized her anywhere. Then
  she looked at the letterpress&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The latest photograph of Amy Rayne, at the Cornus, etc."</p>

  <p>"That woman," Maude gasped. "That infamous creature here! And he dared to
  introduce her to me!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>XXXI. AN OUTRAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE hot blood rushed to Maude's cheeks. She quivered and
  tingled under the insult that Minter had put upon her. He had done it
  deliberately, and with his tongue in his cheek, so to speak. No doubt he had
  been drinking, but he knew quite well what he was about when he had brought
  those two women to lunch at Marvyn Chase.</p>

  <p>Minter might have urged in excuse that he had not expected to find his
  wife or any of her guests present so early in the day. But even that did not
  palliate the bitter insult that he had put upon Maude. Anything vulgar
  connected with the stage she might have tolerated and made light of, but Amy
  Rayne was a different matter.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew this better than Minter. Once the mischief was done it would
  have been easy to give Maude a hint to the effect that the visitors would be
  more comfortable without her society, and she would have understood at
  once.</p>

  <p>But Minter had gone further than this. In his cunning way he had wilfully
  deceived his wife's guest and passed an infamous woman off as Miss Sefton.
  All lunch time the trio were making quiet fun of her. The mere thought of it
  sent the blood tingling to Maude's face. She had actually sat and lunched
  with that infamous creature, a woman whose past was repulsive and whose
  present was unspeakable.</p>

  <p>Under ordinary circumstances Maude would never have found this out. But by
  sheer accident she had been fluttering over the leaves of the
  <i>Lorgnette,</i> and here were the bold features of Amy Rayne smiling
  mockingly in her face.</p>

  <p>"I shall not let it pass," Maude said, shutting her little white teeth
  together. "Lady Mary shall know what is going on in her absence. When I tell
  her this, Marvyn Chase will want a new mistress. She will never remain
  here."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary Minter was by no means strong-minded, but she came from a high,
  proud family, and nobody entered her house whose name was tainted with
  suspicion. For some strange reason she had become the wife of Graham Minter;
  she was afraid of him, but once touch her pride of race and she would have
  broken with her husband to-morrow.</p>

  <p>On the whole it would be best perhaps; such a course would save her much
  trouble in the future. Lady Mary should know of this outrage. Maude was
  calmer now, but the red spot still burnt on her cheek as she carefully put
  the tell-tale <i>Lorgnette</i> away for future reference. She would tell Lady
  Mary everything after dinner, she would leave Marvyn Chase to-morrow and
  never enter it again. Then Maude became aware that somebody was in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>She looked up to see Kit Clive standing before her. Pleasure and surprise
  were on his face.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect this," he said. "Are you quite alone here?"</p>

  <p>Maude explained how it had all come about. A big footman brought in the
  tea and noiselessly vanished. Kit drew his chair up to the table.</p>

  <p>"I came down here to finish some work," he said. "Saturday is more or less
  of a holiday in the City, you know. Under ordinary circumstances I should be
  playing golf. But I am finishing up my affairs with Minter, and I am anxious
  to get everything settled. Maude, what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I have had an unpleasant surprise," Maude said hurriedly. She felt too
  ashamed to tell Kit what was the cause of her annoyance. "It is nothing. Are
  you staying here?"</p>

  <p>"For the next day or two, yes. I am afraid that I am here to play the
  detective. I'm going to get to the bottom of this business, Maude. Of course
  I ought not to be here."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," Maude said, with a watery little smile. "Oh, Kit, why did
  I have that money left me? Why was I not poor?"</p>

  <p>Kit stared at her moodily. He tried to be cheerful in Maude's presence,
  but it was hard work at times. There was a grey shadow on his face now. Maude
  touched his arm gently.</p>

  <p>"Don't," she whispered, "don't look at me like that. I am not worth it,
  Kit."</p>

  <p>"Yes you are, darling. We love one another, and that makes all the
  difference."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does. My whole heart and soul are yours, Kit; my heart cries
  out for you. I shall never be happy without you. I shall never care for any
  one else. Couldn't I buy him off? Would he not spare me if I gave him all the
  money?"</p>

  <p>"You are talking of that scoundrel Desborough?" Kit asked in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I am talking at random," Maude said, with a start. "If I could only tell
  you my secret! Still, there is always hope so long as the fetters are not
  forged. If I can only get free, if I can only see a way out without injuring
  others!"</p>

  <p>"You would do it if you had the chance, Maude!"</p>

  <p>"Would I not, Kit? No, no, you must not kiss me again. There are some
  people coming."</p>

  <p>There was a tramp of feet, a murmur of conversation and light laughter.
  Two or three women came forward, followed by a brace of footmen with more
  tea. Clifford Desborough loomed large behind the pretty women in their
  elaborate tea-gowns.</p>

  <p>"Quite a pretty picture," one of the guests laughed. "So this is why you
  had to come down here so early, Mr. Clive? Pressing business, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have not been here half an hour," Clive said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, much mischief can be done in half an hour," the second visitor
  drawled. "Lady Mary has just come back. Mr. Minter came down in the same
  train with a lot of men, only they preferred a smoker to our society. Please
  may I have some tea."</p>

  <p>The spell was broken now, and Maude a self-contained woman of the world
  again. Desborough pushed to her side with an air of proprietorship that
  caused Kit's fingers to tingle, but not by so much as a quiver of an eyelash
  did Maude betray her feelings. There was a murmur of more voices, Minter's
  high above the rest, hoarse and commanding.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort for me," he was saying. "My time is far too valuable.
  A great mistake if you think you did, dear boy. I've been in the City all the
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>No doubt the man had his own reasons for telling this lie, Maude thought
  with a little feeling of disgust. As Minter came in his eyes met Maude's and
  he winked as if to seal the understanding between them. Under ordinary
  circumstances it might have been allowed to pass; Maude would have simply
  found it discreet to say nothing of the luncheon-party.</p>

  <p>But not now, she was not going to spare the man. He had humbled and
  humiliated her, he had insulted her in the most flagrant fashion, and he was
  going to pay for it. Minter was perfectly sober now, and dominating every one
  about him in his characteristic fashion. Maude waited her time. She would say
  something presently that would bring the millionaire down from his high
  estate. He came up presently to Maude's table with what he imagined to be an
  engaging smile.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary's not here yet," he said. "She is engaged with some
  aristocratic pauper retainer of hers in the housekeeper's room. How have you
  been killing time?"</p>

  <p>"I have been looking over the week's illustrated papers," Maude said very
  slowly and in a clear voice that warned Minter of coming trouble. "I found
  them very interesting. But the most interesting of the week's periodicals to
  my mind is the <i>Lorgnette</i>."</p>

  <p>Minter flushed and looked a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Mostly actresses, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and other class of people. I suppose some people like that kind
  of thing. For instance, on the front page of the <i>Lorgnette is</i> a
  portrait of Amy Rayne. I wish I had seen that paper before lunch instead of
  after."</p>

  <p>With the greatest difficulty Minter swallowed an oath. He had been found
  out, and he could read no mercy in Maude's clear, cold eyes. His coarse face
  grew red, the veins stood out on his forehead, he said something, but even
  Maude could not hear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>XXXII. STRATEGY</h2>

  <p class="first">STILL Minter lingered about Maude's table. Lady Mary would
  be here presently and he must try to square matters before then. Kit Clive he
  could get rid of, but Desborough was a different matter. He would get his
  friend Lady Haredale to help him. Presently Lady Haredale signalled
  Desborough gaily to her side and Minter had his opportunity.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is a case of a diamond bracelet," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Maude smiled. This man's creed was that money could do everything. After
  the way he had insulted her he was coolly proposing to heal the wound with a
  present.</p>

  <p>"You have not quite learnt the methods of good Society," she said. "If I
  happened to be a barmaid whom you had injured, why, perhaps&mdash;but the
  idea that I should take anything from your hands is ridiculous. Nor will I
  dwell upon the outrageous way you behaved to your wife's guest. You thought I
  should not find you out, and in the ordinary way you were right. But for once
  fortune has played you a pretty trick. I am going to tell Lady Mary."</p>

  <p>"There is bound to be trouble if you do."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Lady Mary would leave the house in the morning never to
  return. She is weak, and in some strange way she cares for you. But once you
  touch her pride and the pride of her family she can be as hard as a diamond.
  And the Duke and Duchess would uphold her."</p>

  <p>Minter's thick brows were knitted together. He knew resolution when he saw
  it and resolution was here. Nothing was going to stay Maude's hand now.</p>

  <p>"If I had known that you were here," he began weakly.</p>

  <p>"That makes no difference. You outrage your wife and you outrage decency
  by bringing that creature here. And you could easily have spared me the
  humiliation of sitting at the same table. You have brought your punishment
  upon yourself."</p>

  <p>Minter could have taken the speaker by the white throat and choked the
  life out of her frail body. The situation was desperate. The millionaire's
  week-end parties usually had a flavour of business about them and this one
  was very important. A north country magnate was coming in time for dinner, an
  austere man with an equally austere wife, a philanthropist from whom Minter
  had hoped to gain much. If there was anything like scandal the light of the
  great man's countenance would be withdrawn with disastrous results.</p>

  <p>"I must have this out with you," Minter said hoarsely, "but not before
  this mob of chattering jays. What pleasure my wife can see in their company
  beats me. We don't dine till half-past eight, so there will be plenty of
  time. Meet me in the billiard-room at seven."</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest good in that," Maude said. "My mind is made
  up."</p>

  <p>"Meet me there at seven," Minter went on doggedly. "I suppose you can
  change your mind like other people?"</p>

  <p>Maude shook her head resolutely as Minter turned away. He must be by
  himself a little while or he would break out before all these people. As he
  left the hall Desborough followed. Maude watched them with an outward air of
  indifference that she carried off very well. She would have given much to
  have followed them and listened to their conversation. Kit came back
  again.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have upset Minter," he said. "I never saw the man so utterly
  beaten before. It may be my powerful imagination, but it seemed to me that he
  blushed."</p>

  <p>"I fancy he did," Maude smiled. "Let us go and walk up and down the
  terrace."</p>

  <p>Kit assented eagerly enough. He wanted nothing better than to be by
  Maude's side. The little comedy between the girl and Minter still puzzled
  him.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" he urged. "And why does he shy so at the mention of the
  <i>Lorgnette?</i> Unless I am greatly mistaken he offered you a diamond
  bracelet?"</p>

  <p>"Your ears are too long, Kit," Maude laughed. "But it was something like
  that. All the same I'll tell you nothing till I've seen Lady Mary."</p>

  <p>Kit looked thoughtfully across the garden.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't press that man too far if I were you," he said. "He has a vast
  deal of power to do you good or harm. From a diplomatic point of view it
  would be better to make a friend of him. Unless I am greatly mistaken he
  knows all about you and Desborough. I mean the way in which the engagement
  has been brought about. Minter is a very clever man and he has a pretty tight
  grip upon Desborough. He might provide you with a weapon with which you could
  cut your way to happiness."</p>

  <p>Maude fairly gasped. She had not thought of this before. Doubtless Minter
  had a strong grip upon Desborough, but it was not stronger than her grip upon
  Minter. But once she told Lady Mary the weapon would be like the sting to the
  bee, useless for the future. And yet Lady Mary ought to know, it was
  dishonourable not to tell her.</p>

  <p>"Would it hurt our host if he had a quarrel with his wife?" she asked. "I
  mean would it make any great difference if Lady Mary left him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, just at present it would," Kit explained. "Minter is a little
  shaky; he has been hand and glove with a very speculative lot. His cue now is
  to be seen with more solid people, he is trying to bring about a big
  syndicate up North. He is coming in contact with men whose names in the North
  are as good as the Bank of England. For the most part they are straight-laced
  and very respectable. If there was any scandal they would drop Minter like a
  hot coal. Murdock, who is coming here to-night, for instance, with his
  wife."</p>

  <p>Maude nodded, she quite understood what Kit meant.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you something," she said. "Mr. Minter was here to
  luncheon. He brought two actresses with him as the day was wet and the river
  excursion a failure. One of them he called Sefton. Of course they were quite
  impossible creatures, but I put up with that. When they were gone I took up
  the <i>Lorgnette</i> and there was the portrait of one of them. But in the
  portrait I refer to she was not called Miss Sefton."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say," Clive burst out&mdash;"you don't mean to say
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do, Kit. It was the infamous Amy Rayne. I have lunched with that
  woman, I have made myself agreeable, I have shaken hands with her. This very
  day in this very house. Mr. Minter thought I should not find out, but you see
  I did. This is why he looked so uncomfortable when I mentioned the
  <i>Lorgnette</i> at teatime. Now what is my obvious duty?"</p>

  <p>"Your obvious duty is to tell Lady Mary and leave the house," Kit said. "I
  didn't think that Minter was quite such an utter blackguard. And yet, Maude,
  and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on, dearest. I know perfectly well what you are going to say."</p>

  <p>"You have yourself to consider. A powerful weapon has been placed in your
  hands. Lots of people I know whose code of honour is pretty high would
  conceal this on diplomatic grounds. If you do so you may save your happiness
  and mine yet. You may be free, you and I together."</p>

  <p>He turned and smiled into Maude's face. They were at an angle of the
  terrace where nobody would see them. Maude's pretty face was uplifted, and
  Kit kissed her.</p>

  <p>"My darling!" he whispered, "the temptation is very fierce, but I am not
  going to press you one way or the other. All I say is sleep on it, say
  nothing to Lady Mary to-night. And hear fully what Minter has to say. He has
  done an unpardonable thing, but you must do him the justice to admit that it
  would never have been done had he known that you were in the house."</p>

  <p>"My blood tingles at the very thought of it," Maude said.</p>

  <p>"So does mine, Under normal circumstances I'd have Minter out here and
  thrash him till my arm ached. But we can't very well take that course. I dare
  not advise you."</p>

  <p>Maude plucked a rose and slowly pulled the blazing, flaming petals away
  one by one. She was half ashamed of her thoughts, pulled this way and that by
  contrary impulses.</p>

  <p>"I'll do as you suggest," she said at length. "It can do no harm to delay
  for a time. And I shall meet Mr. Minter in the billiard room as he
  desired."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>XXXIII. A STRONG APPEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was not much likelihood of Maude and Minter being
  disturbed in the billiard room. Marvyn Chase was a fashionable house, and
  nobody dreamt of playing anything between tea and dinner but bridge. It was
  in the height of the craze, and none seemed to have a mind for anything
  else.</p>

  <p>It would have been hard to say exactly what Maude expected to gain from
  the interview. True, she had a hold upon Minter which was considerably
  strengthened by the information that had come to her from Kit Clive. At the
  present moment Minter would have paid a handsome price to avoid a scandal.
  Might the price be Maude's freedom?</p>

  <p>"I wish I understood these things," Maude sighed to herself. "I wish I
  knew all about business. I suppose clever people would make a bargain here.
  It sounds hateful, and yet my future and my happiness more or less depend
  upon this man."</p>

  <p>The billiard room was empty when she reached there. Nothing less than an
  earthquake would have moved the rest of the party from their beloved bridge.
  Minter looked in furtively, as if half expecting to be disappointed; there
  was a queer smile on his face as he saw Maude.</p>

  <p>"I fancied you would come," he said. "Now let's put it all right. What
  have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>Minter spoke in his hardest and most truculent manner. It was a style that
  seldom failed. But for once Maude was not impressed. She had the whip hand of
  the man and she meant to use her power. A cold little smile flickered over
  her face.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say," she replied. "I have already expressed my opinion
  of your conduct."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. On the whole I admit it was a caddish thing to do."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, or you would not have done it, Mr. Minter." A little colour
  crept into the millionaire's cheeks. It began to dawn upon him that he had a
  clever woman to deal with. If he could only anger her something might be
  gained. But Maude would not move from behind that cold reserve of hers.</p>

  <p>"What is it you really do want?" Minter asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the honest truth, I don't know," Maude admitted, "but I am
  prepared under certain conditions to make a compact with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Minter cried. His red little eyes glistened When it came to matters
  of that kind he generally got the better of his opponent. The joy of battle
  was in him now. For the moment he had almost persuaded himself that Maude was
  beyond corruption.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that remark?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, nothing. But everybody has his price, you know. Come, you
  want something. I can see that in your face. Are you prepared to let me down
  easy in return? At any rate, it can't be a matter of money."</p>

  <p>"I know perfectly well that I should not get it if I asked," Maude
  said.</p>

  <p>"Meaning that I haven't got it?" Minter sneered.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Maude said coolly. "At the present moment you would be
  extremely averse to parting with a large sum&mdash;in fact it would be
  impossible."</p>

  <p>For once in his life Minter was fairly and squarely beaten. All his
  swagger left him; he could only regard Maude with anxious eyes and a haggard
  expression of face. He had deemed his secret absolutely safe from all prying
  eyes, and here was this girl absolutely ignorant of business, yet knew
  everything.</p>

  <p>"You are hovering on the brink of ruin," Maude said. "You hope to retrieve
  your position by getting Mr. Murdock to back your new schemes; you are
  desperately anxious to float something that you can turn into cash. If I say
  one word to Lady Mary, those schemes go to the winds. Mr. Murdock would shake
  the dust of the place from his feet; he would ignore you for the future."</p>

  <p>"Go on," he gasped, "is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I might just as well finish while I am about it," Maude went on.
  "You have still a fair chance of pulling round, especially if you could get
  that Certified Company case settled in your favour; in fact if you did so you
  are absolutely safe. If it goes against you nothing in the world can prevent
  your ruin. Correct me if I am wrong."</p>

  <p>"The game is with you," Minter growled. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"So you had to guard against consequences. You spirited Price out of the
  way so that he should not be asked certain questions. That was not clever of
  you, because until Price can be found the case must remain in abeyance. Do
  you know where Price is?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing whatever about him," Minter said. The interview was not
  going as he had anticipated. "Perhaps you can enlighten the authorities on
  that point."</p>

  <p>Maude smiled. A brilliant inspiration had come to her.</p>

  <p>"As it happens I know everything," she said. "I have only to hold up my
  hand, and Price surrenders at discretion and gives his evidence. I can make
  him speak the truth. I have merely to say the word, and the Certified Company
  collapses like a balloon and Graham Minter goes along with it. You may bribe
  my future husband, but you don't bribe <i>me</i>!"</p>

  <p>Amazement, admiration, wonder possessed Minter in turn.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is it you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Your power over Clifford Desborough. You hold all those papers of
  his&mdash;bills I fancy you call them in your City jargon. You could ruin him
  if you liked. Did you adopt this course so that you might prevent Mr.
  Desborough from doing his duty to his client?"</p>

  <p>Minter nodded sulkily. He had been beaten all along the line. The girl
  seemed to know everything.</p>

  <p>"Tell me more," he said hoarsely, "tell me everything!"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Maude cried. "Knowledge is power. I am going to fight you,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Maude said no more, for there were footsteps in the corridor outside.
  Minter jumped to the slate over the marker and hastily scribbled his name and
  that of Maude upon the board in chalk, and placed a fictitious score against
  each.</p>

  <p>"Sorry there is no time to finish," he said in a loud voice; "perhaps
  after dinner. I have chalked up the figures, and you are in hand after
  potting my ball. Hullo!"</p>

  <p>He winked knowingly at Maude, who was a little amused at this seeming
  unnecessary diplomacy.</p>

  <p>"You have gone too far," she said. "Neither of us could have made half
  those points in the time we have been here. But then I have no diplomacy.
  It's Mr. Harvey Denton."</p>

  <p>Denton came in cigarette in hand.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "I have just arrived. They are all so busy
  at bridge that I fancied a quiet ruminative smoke here."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34"></a>XXXIV. INSTINCT, OR WHAT?</h2>

  <p class="first">WELL, so far it had been anything but a drawn battle, Maude
  told herself as she dressed for dinner. She would have to see Minter again
  later on. She had shaken the man and rendered him uneasy. And Maude was
  playing for her future happiness. Despite the fact that she had passed her
  word, she felt that she could not possibly marry Desborough. Her whole soul
  recoiled from the contract.</p>

  <p>But all these terribly trying emotions found no expression on Maude's face
  as she went in to dinner. She looked gay and handsome enough as she sat by
  Kit's side. They might have been two casual acquaintances getting on famously
  together. That their hearts were aching under the strain of a great tragedy
  would never have been guessed by the spectators.</p>

  <p>"They tell me Desborough's appointment to the Home Office is only a matter
  of time now," Kit said, "and yet he does not look like a happy man."</p>

  <p>Desborough was glaring across the table between the banks of orchids and
  feathery ferns. Maude smiled recklessly; she felt in an audacious mood just
  now.</p>

  <p>"The cares of office are beginning to press on his brow," she said. "All
  the same, he has no right to glare at me like that. What a strange situation
  it is, Kit! Were any two people ever placed like that? You ought to be
  scowling over there and Clifford Desborough smiling here."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't scowl at you, darling," Kit whispered, "and it's all coming
  right. You shall never marry that fellow so long as your heart is mine."</p>

  <p>Maude sighed gently as she toyed with a peach. Perhaps it was all coming
  out right; indeed, she had far stronger hopes since her interview with Graham
  Minter.</p>

  <p>Her pleasant thoughts were cut short by Lady Mary rising and moving
  towards the door. Maude lingered in the hall with a feeling that she wanted
  to be alone for a time. There were a great many fine pictures there, and she
  had a passionate love of art. Then her pleasant thoughts fled as she saw
  Desborough standing by her side.</p>

  <p>"Come out of doors," he said, "I want to speak to you."</p>

  <p>It was a hard command rather than a request. But Maude made no protest.
  She caught up a wrap and flung it round her white shoulders. In a sulky kind
  of way Desborough proffered his arm, but Maude chose to ignore it altogether.
  "You are too much with Clive," Desborough said, going to the root of the
  matter. "I can't have it!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Maude said coldly. "Until you are my lord&mdash;and
  master&mdash;I shall go my own way. You see I am very fond of
  Kit&mdash;indeed, I love him. Nothing could after that fact&mdash;not even my
  calling myself Mrs. Clifford Desborough."</p>

  <p>"It is unwise to throw that in my teeth. If you hate me so
  much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't hate you at all. From the bottom of my heart I pity you!"</p>

  <p>"Pity me! I am an envied man. For the life of me I can't see where the
  pity comes in!"</p>

  <p>"It is because you are such a pitiful scoundrel. I watched you to-night at
  dinner. I felt like standing up and telling everybody the truth. Fancy if I
  had! It would be death to your ambition. You would be generally shunned, you
  would have to take your name off your clubs. I doubt if you would ever see a
  brief again. Oh, pitiful, pitiful scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>Maude spoke sternly and with a deep ring in her voice. Her face was turned
  upwards, she seemed to be addressing her speech to the silent stars. She
  could not see the shamed red on Desborough's face.</p>

  <p>"I was happy until you came," Maude went on, "was happy in the love of a
  good man. Then you made a shameful use of a family secret. You did that
  because you were poor and in debt. You wanted to get free from Minter and
  those bills of yours he had bought."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about that?" Desborough cried hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Everything. To save the situation you would actually have sold your brief
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a lie! I defied Minter to do his worst over that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true!" Maude cried. "You may have defied Minter and made a show of
  doing so, but you are going to let him have his own way in the end. If not,
  why did you shield Price&mdash;why did you not give him over to the police
  the night that he visited your chambers?"</p>

  <p>Desborough was silent, too astonished for words. He could not deny this;
  he had temporized and allowed Price to go, when all the time his duty lay
  clear as crystal before him. And Maude seemed to know everything. Small
  wonder, then, that he seemed a poor creature in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You can atone," Maude went on. "Defy Minter, let Price be
  forthcoming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Price has utterly vanished, so far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>"But not so far as I am concerned. He can be produced. Let him come and
  give his evidence. If I say the word, he will appear without delay. Then do
  your duty. And when Minter wreaks his vengeance upon you, come to me and I
  will find the money. Is that not plain?"</p>

  <p>"And the price I am to pay for this?"</p>

  <p>Maude laughed scornfully. Really the man's effrontery was amazing.</p>

  <p>"Who are you to talk about price?" she said. "Am I not saving your honour
  and your political reputation? Am I not bringing the derelict into smooth
  water again? At a cost of ten thousand pounds for the sake of a man whose
  soul, is not worth so many pence!"</p>

  <p>"Does it not occur to you that I have a heart?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, really, so remote a contingency had not occurred to me," Maude
  said. "If you have done me the honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To fall in love with you? Well, the unexpected has happened, as it
  generally does."</p>

  <p>"Go away and think over my offer," Maude said. "I have put up with a great
  deal, but the idea of you making love to me&mdash;well! I want to be
  alone."</p>

  <p>She turned away and walked to the far end of the terrace.</p>

  <p>What was that? Something that sounded like a cry of alarm, followed by the
  deep bay of a hound. Presently the moving animal came closer, and Maude
  rubbed her eyes. She passed swiftly down the steps and into the park. Her
  heart was beating fast, but she was not afraid. She gave a peculiarly long
  whistle.</p>

  <p>The great dog stopped, and threw up his head and howled.</p>

  <p>"Gambit!" Maude cried. "Gambit! come here, sir! What does this mean, and
  why are you this long way from home?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35"></a>XXXV. THE DOG AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE big dog took no heed of Maude's call. She could see the
  great lithe body swaying noiselessly over the grass, head down, and going up
  and down like a setter in a field of turnips. The motion was not particularly
  fast, but seemed slightly puzzled and hesitating. Presently the dog threw up
  his head and gave a short whine.</p>

  <p>Maude began to have her doubts. Gambit was a well-trained dog, and never
  before had his mistress known him to disregard her lightest wish. Possibly
  she had made a mistake after all. Minter was fond of dogs and his kennel was
  a large one. He might have a score of bloodhounds for all Maude knew to the
  contrary.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I'm going to see," she told herself. "The likeness to
  Gambit is amazing."</p>

  <p>Heedless of the heavy falling dew and her thin satin slippers, Maude
  passed across the little fancy bridge leading to the park. If the dog did not
  turn out to be Gambit she might find herself in a considerable personal
  danger. But she did not let her mind dwell on that. If, on the other hand,
  the dog was Gambit, then there was some mystery here that she was going to
  solve once and for all.</p>

  <p>She was close to the hound by this time; he passed her in his eager
  search. There was no longer any question about it&mdash;here was Gambit to a
  certainty. The slope of the shoulders, the ragged white patch on the breast
  proved the fact.</p>

  <p>"Come here, sir!" Maude commanded sternly. "Come here at once!"</p>

  <p>Gambit pulled up and shivered. He seemed glad enough to see Maude, but at
  the same time was asking his mistress quite plainly not to interfere with his
  search. But Maude laid a detaining hand on his collar, and with a whine he
  surrendered to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"Not another yard do you stir, sir!" Maude said firmly.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" a faint voice came from the darkness close by. "Beg
  pardon, miss, but there's no call to be frightened. I'm standing in a pool of
  water so as to destroy the scent. If I hadn't found it, that dog would have
  killed me."</p>

  <p>With Gambit so close Maude had no fear. Evidently she had found a burglar
  or something of that kind. But the man's voice seemed fresh and candid,
  albeit a little tinged with fear.</p>

  <p>"Come out and explain yourself," Maude said! "you are safe now."</p>

  <p>A dark figure emerged from the pool where the deer came to drink. With
  some little surprise Maude saw that he was dressed as a policeman.</p>

  <p>"You were going your rounds?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, I am a London constable. I had just gone off duty, and was on
  my way home when I made a discovery. I saw a man who was wanted. Only he had
  a bicycle. So I got a cycle, too, and he spotted me. It was a pretty stiff
  chase, but I thought I had run my man down. I was dodging him for over an
  hour. Then the dog turned up. I believe he was hunting my man, only I crossed
  the trail and the brute began to hunt <i>me</i>. If you will keep your dog
  quiet till I can reach my machine I'll be greatly obliged, miss."</p>

  <p>"And the man you are after?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's pretty sure to be miles off by this time. Good-night, and
  thank you kindly."</p>

  <p>The luckless officer hurried off in the direction of the lodge. The matter
  was more or less serious, and Gambit's extraordinary conduct still
  unexplained, but Maude could not repress a smile.</p>

  <p>"Now who did you follow in the first place?" she asked. "Certainly not the
  policeman. And you did not come down here to give me a surprise visit, or you
  would have behaved differently."</p>

  <p>The spines on Gambit's back stiffened and he growled.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake go back!" a hoarse voice whispered.</p>

  <p>"Get into the brook again! That infernal dog hasn't gone. I'd give
  something for a revolver!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Price," Maude said quietly, "you can come on without being afraid. As
  to your companion, he had perhaps better stay where he is. I want a word with
  you."</p>

  <p>Price was understood to say something that sounded grateful. He was wet to
  the knees, he shivered with cold and his whole aspect was one of sullen
  discontent.</p>

  <p>"Seems like a providence," he said. "I came down to see you, Miss
  Beaumont. I was just a little bit too audacious perhaps, but I got myself
  spotted. I was on my bike and I moved off pretty sharp for a street or two.
  And then presently I was awake to the fact that I was being followed on
  another machine by the man who had spotted me. I might as well come this way
  as any other, and here I am. If you have seen anything of the
  police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have," Maude said curtly. "But they have gone on&mdash;at least, the
  one man has. He was being hunted by the dog. When I got here he was standing
  in the pool where the deer drink."</p>

  <p>Price laughed aloud. The humour of the situation appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"Fancy that!" he exclaimed. "Mr. Bobby must have crossed my trail and
  drawn the dog on him. Your hound has not been properly trained to this kind
  of thing, so he has merely followed his instincts."</p>

  <p>"How did your companion get here?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"He came down by train. Business in the neighbourhood not connected with
  your matters. He promised to meet me here, knowing that I must see you."</p>

  <p>"What necessity is there for you to see me?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, a mere desire for money. London is getting warm for
  me. I must make fresh woods and pastures for a time. I invented an excuse to
  call for you, and when I came out the dog was airing himself on the pavement.
  Doubtless he followed me, reminiscences of our first meeting proving too
  strong for him. Gambit has done me a good turn, though he is certainly an
  angel very much disguised. But if I am to work for you I must have more
  money."</p>

  <p>Maude made no demur to this cool suggestion. Price should have money in
  reason if he would only find the information that Maude required. She had
  expected to pay for these services, but later on she was going to use Price
  in a way that he little imagined.</p>

  <p>"Let me have your address directly you have one, and I will telegraph you
  money," she said. "You had better go now, as I shall be missed if I don't
  return to the house. Get away at once. Cross the brook so as to break the
  scent for the dog, and find your way back to the main road. Is there anything
  else that you have to say to me?"</p>

  <p>Price thought not. There was a restless furtiveness about him that gave
  Maude an uneasy impression that he was deceiving her, that he had not come to
  see her at all, that as a matter of fact he had blundered upon her quite by
  accident.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave the dog here," she said, as if some sudden idea had occurred
  to her. "Please go and take your companion along, Mr. Price; you would do a
  great deal for £20,000?"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't I? I'd give myself up and work out my sentence for that.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>Maude turned away. She had learnt all that she required. But it was a big
  price to pay even to a scoundrel like this. But Maude was beginning to see
  her way without paying anything at all.</p>

  <p>Price disappeared in the darkness. Maude stood hesitating a long time.
  Finally she took off one of her gloves and gave it to the dog.</p>

  <p>"Take it home," she said. "Do you understand, sir? Take it home! Now
  go!"</p>

  <p>Gambit waved his great tail as if he understood. With a little bark of
  suppressed affection he picked up the glove and slung off at a steady trot.
  Well satisfied, Maude turned her face in the direction of the house.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that dog has gone," a thin, affected voice said from close by.
  "He worried me. Once I thought he was going to kill me. But he seemed to know
  a lady when he saw me, my dear."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36"></a>XXXVI. COUNTESS DE LARY</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE expressed no surprise. The recent rapid rush of events
  had deprived her of that emotion. She saw a slight, elderly figure, dressed
  in old-fashioned but none the less distinguished style, a foreign style
  evidently; indeed the speaker's English, if correct enough, proclaimed that
  fact. Maude could see a faded, rather highly-strung face behind a cloud of
  untidy, grey hair. The small bonnet was awry, and the speaker's lace skirt
  was sadly torn.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," Maude said. "I am very sorry my dog has been the
  cause of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are, my dear," the stranger said. "Your voice is very
  sincere. If I could see your face I should know you were
  beautiful&mdash;beauty always goes with a voice like yours. I was walking up
  to the house when the dog came up to me."</p>

  <p>"He did you no harm, I hope!" Maude said.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, my dear. He seemed sort of surprised to see me. His
  bristles were up, he walked on the tips of his toes, and I was terribly
  frightened. He seemed to be asking me questions. But I couldn't tell him
  anything, you know. Then some men came along and the dog followed them. All
  the same I was terribly frightened."</p>

  <p>The speaker was still trembling from head to foot. There was a simplicity
  about her speech and a restlessness of limb that suggested a mind none too
  strong.</p>

  <p>"Let me walk as far as the lodge gates with you," Maude said soothingly,
  "then I shall be able to tell you exactly where you are and which way to
  go."</p>

  <p>The stranger laughed a little vacantly.</p>

  <p>"You mistake me," she said. "Oh, I am not in the least mad. As a matter of
  fact, my dear, I am an exceedingly clever old woman. Baron Kinski found that
  out, for all he got the best of me. But I'm going to ruin Kinski yet!"</p>

  <p>The poor creature was mad enough beyond all doubt&mdash;mad but harmless.
  And yet she had followed the drift of Maude's thoughts with wonderful
  penetration.</p>

  <p>"I am going to surprise the Baron," she went on. "Everybody thinks he is
  in America, but I know better. I had certain information that he was in
  England, and I followed him here. You must understand that he is most
  carefully disguised. And last night I saw him, I heard him speak. He said he
  was going to spend the week-end at Marvyn Chase. To find out where is Marvyn
  Chase&mdash;behold how easy it is. Then I make my plans to fit the situation.
  I come here by train, but for an accident I arrive at the house. I give a
  servant a sovereign, and say I must see Baron Kinski at once. He comes
  without the slightest suspicion, ah&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused, and her features grew dark and furious. Maude's tact
  showed her the futility of saying that there was no such person at Marvyn
  Chase. But after all, was she quite certain about that? Marvyn Chase was a
  huge house, and a score of extra guests made very little difference. Again,
  for the most part, Minter's friends were quite apart from those of his wife,
  and other of his friends might have even arrived since Maude left the house.
  Certainly there had been no Baron Kinski at dinner, but he might have come
  since.</p>

  <p>If this old lady saw the baron there would be a scene and perhaps a
  scandal. Doubtless she had had some financial relations with the great
  capitalist in question, and had imagined that her ruin had been brought about
  by him. The same thing had occurred over and over again.</p>

  <p>"You came down from London?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mais oui,</i> by train. For the time being I spend my last florin; I
  have not even a fare back. Entirely I rely upon my infamous friend the Baron.
  Once I see him I have money in plenty. In my pocket there are papers that I
  could not possibly produce before. Conduct me to the Baron, and you shall see
  what you shall see, my dear."</p>

  <p>Maude murmured something soothing. As a matter of fact this was the very
  thing she had not the slightest intention of doing. At any costs that must be
  prevented.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said. "You are a lone woman suffering wrongs at the hands of
  bad men, and so am I. This house is the residence of Mr. Graham Minter and my
  friend Lady Mary, his wife."</p>

  <p>"That I know. Mr. Graham Minter was a friend of the Baron. He married Lady
  Mary Stockford, and I used to know her. I once had the pleasure of doing a
  service to the Duchess and Lady Mary in Vienna. She would remember me, I
  expect."</p>

  <p>"Of course she would," Maude said soothingly. "Therefore I am going to
  take you to her, and you can explain all the circumstances of the case. But
  there must be no scenes, you understand, no confronting the wicked Baron
  before the guests. You shall have your chance quietly. You must see how much
  better that course will be."</p>

  <p>The Countess de Lary nodded. In spite of her fantastic air and flighty
  brain, she had still all the best instincts of her race and training. She
  would be <i>désolé</i> to cause any inconvenience to <i>la belle</i> Lady
  Mary, whom she remembered as a pretty girl in Vienna years ago. Her vengeance
  would keep perfectly well till the morning. She was very tired to-night.</p>

  <p>"Poor old soul, I can see that!" Maude said. "Now come along with me; take
  my arm. We will not go through the front door, because I should not care for
  the guests to see you as you are, or to see me either for the matter of
  that."</p>

  <p>Maude looked down at her soaked dress and shoes. They would have to be
  changed.</p>

  <p>"We'll go in by way of the side conservatory," she said, "up the private
  stairway that leads to Lady Mary's boudoir. When I have got you there I will
  fetch my hostess."</p>

  <p>"I am not accustomed," the Countess said with some dignity,
  "to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Maude went on hurriedly. "But under the circumstances,
  you see&mdash;and the first person you might meet in the hall would probably
  be Baron Kinski. Now, would you like to appear in the midst of a smart
  house-party dressed as you are?"</p>

  <p>Maude had touched the right note, and the old lady simpered and smiled. In
  silence the terrace was reached. A light blazed in the smaller conservatory.
  It appeared to be empty as Maude came in, though the reek of recent cigarette
  smoke was strong there. Somebody was playing and singing in the music room;
  there was a murmur of conversation from the hall, but the majority of the
  guests had reverted to their beloved Bridge.</p>

  <p>"Come along," Maude whispered, "the coast is clear. Nobody is here."</p>

  <p>The little old lady came simpering in. She lifted her nose daintily.</p>

  <p>"The Baron has been here," she said! "I recognize the peculiar scent of
  his cigarettes. Perique, my dear, and a suggestion of opium. I used to smoke
  them myself; they come from Batoum, in Asia Minor."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Maude whispered as she went forward, "there is somebody here."</p>

  <p>There was a rustle behind a big palm, and the pale face of Graham Minter
  looked round furtively. Maude had never seen her host with a pale face
  before, and the phenomenon startled her. Minter's eyes were positively
  haggard for a moment. Then he dropped down on his hands and knees and seemed
  to be making his way in that grovelling fashion for the far doorway.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do?" Maude suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Minter said. His voice sounded hoarse and strained and far off.
  "It is a diamond stud, I mean a valuable paper I have lost. Don't say a word
  to anybody, but pass on. Take that infernal old woman away! Take her and
  drown her somewhere! Go on!"</p>

  <p>Maude turned away with a feeling of disgust. The Countess seemed to have
  fallen into a waking trance over the beauty of the flowers. She hardly heeded
  as Maude touched her arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is like old times," she said. "The flowers! I love them as they
  love the sunshine. I shall have them all again after I have seen the
  Baron."</p>

  <p>She passed on, half dragged by Maude. Minter rose to his feet and dusted
  his knees with a hand that shook like the palsy.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he groaned. "Good heavens! Of all the places in the world,
  <i>here</i>!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37"></a>XXXVII. THE UNINVITED GUEST</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE'S first impression was that Minter had gone mad.
  Certainly he was quite sober, he had not shown such signs of agitation
  otherwise. The same thing had happened before to men who carried too much on
  their minds. But on the other hand, if Minter were mad there was much method
  in it. On the whole Maude was forced to the conclusion that the unhappy woman
  had been one of Graham Minter's financial victims, and with a man's horror of
  a scene, he feared to meet her under his own roof.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the old lady must be attended to. She followed quite willingly,
  half lingering to admire the pictures and the staircase and the flowers
  ranged along the banisters. Her feet sank caressingly into the thick Persian
  carpets.</p>

  <p>"You are fond of these things," Maude said as she hurried her along.</p>

  <p>"My dear, yes," the Countess de Lary whispered. "As a child we had them
  all in my father's house. He was an artist with a great soul, and that soul I
  inherited from him. Beautiful things are warmth and food to me. Since I have
  been ruined I have lived apart from beauty. Imagine my delight to find myself
  here!"</p>

  <p>The speaker seemed to have forgotten everything else. A little murmur of
  delight escaped her as she entered Lady Mary's boudoir. She stood quite
  fascinated for a moment. There was a rustle of silken skirts outside, and as
  Maude stepped into the corridor Lady Mary was there.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me, Maude," she said. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>Maude explained generally, with no reference to her own share in the
  adventure or that of Gambit. Lady Mary listened attentively. She was not
  particularly strong mentally, but her beauty and her intense feeling for
  suffering of all kinds made up for that. She appeared to be deeply interested
  in the fortunes of the Countess de Lary.</p>

  <p>"Poor old soul!" she said sweetly. "Of course she is utterly mistaken. I
  am quite sure there is no such person as Baron Kinski in the house."</p>

  <p>"He is a great European capitalist," Maude explained. "You have surely
  heard of him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, from my husband, who usually talks of nothing but business. But
  I understood that the Baron was not in Europe at all. He was coming to London
  this year; in fact, my husband recommended him the house next to ours in Park
  Lane. He is an American." Maude had not expected to hear anything to the
  contrary. Clearly the Countess' troubles had interfered with her brain. "But
  something must be done for her," she said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Lady Mary said promptly. "There shall be no talk among the
  servants. I shall merely say that the Countess lost her train or she would
  have been here before. Then to-morrow we can see what can be done for her. I
  won't even call in my maid."</p>

  <p>The Countess stood raptly contemplating a head by Romney as her hostess
  entered. It was some little time before they could bring her in touch with
  mundane affairs again. The draggled skirt was removed, so were the soaked
  shoes and stockings, and the mischief made good by Maude's deft hands. In a
  very short time the Countess was transformed into a <i>grande</i> dame who
  fitted beautifully into the picture.</p>

  <p>"Your lace is splendid," Lady Mary said. "And those things fit you so
  well. All you require now are a few stones in that lovely white hair of
  yours. I'll get you some."</p>

  <p>But the Countess waved the suggestion aside.</p>

  <p>"There is no need," she said, "I have some in my hand-bag. I have always
  kept them, because I shall need money when my turn comes and I can crush the
  Baron Kinski. I have been very near starvation more than once, my dears, but
  I have always kept these."</p>

  <p>She took a couple of shabby-looking green cases from her shabby little
  handbag, and poured the contents into her hand. A stream of living fire flew
  from them. On her head and round her neck the glorious stones glittered. Her
  faded cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"How magnificent?" Maude cried. "Do you always carry them?"</p>

  <p>"Always&mdash;in my little bag wherever I go. They have been in my family
  three hundred years; they are all that is left out of a once princely
  fortune. Oh, if I had been content with it!"</p>

  <p>Maude wondered. Doubtless the gambling spirit had been inherited like the
  diamonds. It was thrilling to think of this poor old lady in her dingy
  lodgings, walking the mean streets with this fortune in her hand all the
  time. She nodded brightly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can take care of myself," she said. "It is only when I come to
  dabble with stocks and shares that I lose my head. The Baron shall see when
  we meet in a country like this, where one can get justice. I am just a lady
  in a lady's house now."</p>

  <p>She drew herself up proudly for a moment; then her head dropped. Lady Mary
  had an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"You will like a little refreshment of some kind," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I should. I have had nothing since breakfast. My little money
  had gone, you see, and I had my ticket to pay for. A temporary
  faintness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded significantly to Maude, who flew downstairs into the
  dining-room. It was a little difficult to make a selection from the profusion
  on the sideboard, but it was done at length, including a tiny flask of
  champagne. It was not a great deal, but the Countess did not give the
  suggestion of being a large eater.</p>

  <p>Maude was creeping up the stairs again, pleased with the knowledge that
  she had not been seen. Desborough stepped out of the library and called to
  her. There was a look of command in his eyes, his mouth was hard and
  cruel.</p>

  <p>"Come here," he said, "I have a few words to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Presently," Maude said coldly. "At present I am engaged. And if I were
  you I would keep that manner till you had the legal right to use it."</p>

  <p>"I will wait for you here ten minutes," said Desborough, "no longer."</p>

  <p>A hot retort trembled on Maude's lips for the moment. Then she saw that
  Desborough's cold eyes were critically taking in her clammy skirt and sopping
  shoes, which she had not changed yet. Well, after all, it was no business of
  his, and Maude was going to stand none of this.</p>

  <p>"I will not unduly try your patience," she said. "I <i>shall</i> be there
  in ten minutes, because I also have a few words to say to <i>you</i>!"</p>

  <p>Desborough made no reply as he turned on his heel and affected to look at
  the pictures. Inwardly raging, Maude went upstairs, all her old troubles
  heavy about her shoulders again. She had made a certain amount of progress,
  and discovered much useful information, but as yet she could not quite see
  her way to put it all into effect. Perhaps Kit might help her.</p>

  <p>The Countess' eyes gleamed as she saw the food, but she ate slowly and in
  the manner of one accustomed to such things. Her breeding never broke down
  for a moment. Gradually the wild look left her face; she sat there placid and
  contented, the very picture of an elderly lady of the grand old school, who
  had never known anything but the sunshine of prosperity.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we had better leave you here," Lady Mary suggested,
  "because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because you are fearful for me, my dear. You need not be afraid; I am all
  right <i>now</i>. Take me among your guests&mdash;let me live in the old
  atmosphere for a few hours. Please!"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary looked helplessly at Maude, who nodded. Maude was anxious to see
  the Countess and Minter face to face. It might have been a dangerous
  experiment, but the girl was in a reckless mood, and anxious to gratify her
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Come down presently," she said. "You shall make up your story so as to
  account for your new guest whilst I go and change. I am wet through."</p>

  <p>Maude slipped away to her own room and changed. Then she went downstairs
  to meet Desborough and have it out with him. But Desborough was nowhere to be
  seen for the present, and standing anxiously in the hall and apparently
  waiting for Maude was Minter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. A BLOW</h2>

  <p class="first">THE millionaire smiled in an uneasy fashion. He was making a
  clumsy effort to appear entirely at his ease. The <i>rôle</i> did not sit
  well on him, and Maude saw through it at once.</p>

  <p>"Wondered where you had got to," he said. "Been collecting any more
  curiosities lately? Where did you pick up that strange old fossil you brought
  into the conservatory?"</p>

  <p>"What do you know about her?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that she is an intolerable nuisance. She's mad on
  capitalists. If she had recognized me tonight there would have been an awful
  scene. Know who she is?"</p>

  <p>The question was asked keenly, but with a fine assumption of
  carelessness.</p>

  <p>"I do," Maude said quietly. "She is Countess de Lary, of Vienna."</p>

  <p>Minter started and bit his lip. Maude appeared to be quite sure of her
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Let them look after her in the housekeeper's room," he said. "See that
  she has every comfort, and put her in a train for London the first thing in
  the morning. I believe she is quite harmless, but we don't want anything in
  the nature of a scene here. Oh, yes; I am coming, coming!"</p>

  <p>A voice from an inner room summoned Minter imperatively. Maude stood there
  for a moment before Desborough appeared. He strode over to her and looked
  down into her eyes, but they did not quail.</p>

  <p>"You are dramatic," Maude said with a slight laugh. "What does this
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means that I am going to be master. Where have you been to-night?"</p>

  <p>"On the terrace. I stayed there after you left me. Is there anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the truth. You were away for an hour or more. It is quite dry and
  hard on the terrace. Then why do you come in as if you had been crossing a
  river?"</p>

  <p>"The answer is quite simple. I was in the park. I may be very careless and
  inconsiderate, but not even I can prevent the summer dew falling on the
  grass."</p>

  <p>Desborough clenched his hands passionately. Beaten almost to the knees
  himself, he wanted something to crush down to his own level. Some day the
  girl should recognize his will.</p>

  <p>"You went there to meet somebody," he said. "Tell me who you met
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I met Mr. Eli Price, the escaped convict who saved himself by
  sheltering in your chambers some days ago. We had an interesting
  conversation."</p>

  <p>Desborough's face fell. He had not expected this.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must believe you," he said. "We will admit for the sake of
  argument that you met this man in question. But didn't you meet anybody
  else?"</p>

  <p>"I did not," she said. "The first meeting was clearly an accident. There
  was no second. If you insinuate that I went into the park to meet
  Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, say the end&mdash;Kit Clive. You went there to meet him."</p>

  <p>"I did nothing of the kind, neither did I see him. Oh, this is
  monstrous!"</p>

  <p>"And yet you come back soaking wet! A few minutes after you return in this
  draggled condition, Clive comes back also with his feet saturated and damp.
  When I point out the matter to him he says it is a mere nothing, and goes off
  to his room to change. I am to be fooled with denials like this. If this
  thing occurs again, do you understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It cannot occur again because it has never occurred before," Maude
  flashed out hotly. "And let me tell <i>you</i> something. If I want to see
  Kit I shall do so. There is no occasion for clandestine meetings. If I had
  met him in the park to-night I should never have denied it!"</p>

  <p>"You are telling a deliberate lie about it now!"</p>

  <p>Maude would have replied scathingly, but was saved the trouble. A hand was
  laid lightly on her shoulder, and she was put aside by the subject of the
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"You are not displaying your usual discretion, Desborough," Kit said
  coldly. "If you discuss your clients' affairs as loudly as you discuss your
  own, I wonder at your success. Your voice is unpleasantly high when you do
  your best to tell the house that Miss Beaumont had been meeting me secretly
  and that she tells a deliberate lie in denying the fact."</p>

  <p>"She does," Desborough said doggedly, "and you are telling another at the
  present moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Clifford!" Maude cried in genuine distress, "how can you so far
  forget yourself? If&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused, for Clive had passed the bounds of endurance. In some
  underhand, disgraceful way this man had robbed him of all that he held most
  dear. All the pent-up rage and hate burst its bands. He stepped forward and
  dealt Desborough a crashing blow in the mouth. He staggered back, and only
  saved himself by catching at the corner of an old oak table close by.</p>

  <p>"You hound!" Kit hissed, "you mean, dishonourable scoundrel! For Maude's
  sake I was going to let this pass, but I can do so no longer. By some
  disgraceful trick of which I know nothing&mdash;but shall find out&mdash;you
  rob me of the woman I love! Bah! you are not fit for the touch of an honest
  hand. And yet it is for you to judge of the honour and integrity of others!
  By heavens, if you don't give us both an ample apology I'll do it all over
  again!"</p>

  <p>But Desborough slipped away quietly with his handkerchief to his face.
  Fortunately nobody had seen or heard anything of the altercation. Kit looked
  at Maude.</p>

  <p>"They must have heard me shout at him," he said.</p>

  <p>"You didn't shout," Maude said unsteadily. "Your voice was only a whisper,
  Kit. I have never seen a man in such a rage before. It was dreadful."</p>

  <p>"My darling, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Are you, Kit?" Maude went on with a watery smile. "I'm not. I'm glad,
  <i>glad</i>. How dare he insult us in that disgraceful fashion&mdash;a man
  who&mdash;who I am going to marry. And therefore it may be dreadfully
  unladylike, but, I tell you, I am <i>glad</i> you struck him."</p>

  <p>"Well, nobody is likely to be any the wiser," was Kit's consoling remark.
  "For my sake, my darling, I shall be silent, and Desborough is not likely to
  proclaim it from the housetops that he has been thrashed for insulting a
  lady. But I was in the park all the same, Maude."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say that you followed me, Kit?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that. I was going down to the lodge to fetch some
  forgotten papers when I saw you. And when I saw you speaking to some
  suspicious-looking man I stopped. I was pretty close to you, but I could not
  hear what you said, neither did I desire to do so. I have no doubt you will
  tell me all about the affair in your own good time."</p>

  <p>"I will, Kit, but not to-night. Oh, I am so tired and weary of it all!
  Sometimes it seems to me that I can see the way clear before me, and at other
  times it is all dark and hopeless. Let us get away from here before they
  adjourn to the billiard room."</p>

  <p>There were sounds from the drawing-room that signified the breaking-up of
  the Bridge parties. A few of the stragglers had already overflowed into the
  hall. There was the usual babble, the usual disputes over this or that card
  played, and the clinking of money.</p>

  <p>"Well, ask our host," a thin voice piped. "He must let us play for higher
  stakes to-morrow. Positively, I must have my revenge. Where is Lady
  Mary?"</p>

  <p>Minter replied that he had not the slightest idea. He was uneasy in his
  mind, for the great Murdock had not come, and there was no telegram to
  explain his absence. Personally, he would gladly have dispensed with his
  guests to-night.</p>

  <p>"There's Lady Mary coming down the stairs," somebody said. "But who is
  with her? What diamonds!"</p>

  <p>"The Countess de Lary," another voice said. "I didn't know she was staying
  here. By Jove! they are stones too. I say, Minter, what do you say
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Minter had vanished. With a curse that nearly choked him, he slipped
  into the library and locked the door behind him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39"></a>XXXIX. THE POLESTAR</h2>

  <p class="first">ONLY Maude watched the effect on Minter with any interest.
  Why was that strong man, with his marvellous audacity and cunning, afraid to
  meet Countess de Lary? Maude wondered if it would be possible to bring them
  face to face, and what might happen if she did. Would she learn anything
  useful, or would she ruin all her plans?</p>

  <p>To grip some vital secret of Minter's would be somewhat in the nature of
  salvation. If so, she might force him to relax his hold over Clifford
  Desborough, and keep that back as the price of her freedom. Not that she
  dared build up any hopes on this, but she was lonely and unaided, and
  fighting desperately for her future and her happiness.</p>

  <p>It was the idle chattering hour before bed; Bridge was over for the night,
  and there was nothing much to do beyond smoking in the hall and playing
  billiards. Therefore the Countess and her wonderful diamonds attracted more
  than usual attention. The elderly lady was quite herself now; she was quite
  at home there, and evidently meant to keep her word. There were guests there,
  too, who knew something of the life-story of Countess de Lary, the one-time
  brilliant beauty who had set a Court ablaze, and whose exceptional talents
  had been a universal theme.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful woman," a bronzed globe-trotter said to his pretty companion.
  "Wrote books, and painted pictures, and composed music. Was music mad when I
  knew, her years ago. Finally, she married de Lary for his millions, which she
  dissipated in speculation after his death. There's no doubt that Kinski
  robbed her."</p>

  <p>"Who is Kinski?" the pretty companion asked.</p>

  <p>"A comet, I should say. Burst on Vienna all at once; was going to make
  everybody's fortune, that kind of philanthropist, you know. He got heaps of
  money, and went off to America to look after some El Dorado he had purchased
  there. The bubble isn't pricked yet, but it will be. Pretty certain Vienna
  will never know Kinski any more."</p>

  <p>"But he's taken a big house in London next to the Minters," the young girl
  urged.</p>

  <p>The bronzed man shrugged his shoulders. He did not profess to understand
  these things; he was a man of honour, and a gentleman who steered clear of
  Minter and his associates. He was only here because of his feelings for the
  pretty girl by his side.</p>

  <p>"My dears, I declare that you make me feel quite conceited," the Countess
  was saying. "Yes; I suppose they are very pretty diamonds. They have been in
  our family for ages."</p>

  <p>A little ring of women stood round the speaker. One, a little bolder than
  the rest, touched the stream of living fire that formed the necklet. The
  pendant she studied carefully.</p>

  <p>"Was this part of the family heirloom?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, it wasn't," the Countess said with a little laugh. "I got that
  from Baron Kinski. But I promised not to mention his name. He was the man, my
  dear, who robbed me of everything."</p>

  <p>"It is quite an old story," said Lady Mary hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite," the Countess said as hurriedly. "But I must explain a little.
  That man robbed me of everything. I need not tell you how, at the present
  moment, I am prepared to prove that. But then, that is not the point. The
  pendant is called the polestar&mdash;diamonds let into a huge ruby, as you
  see. I borrowed it for a certain purpose, and I kept it. Shall I say
  more?"</p>

  <p>The speaker looked anxiously and inquiringly at Lady Mary, who shook her
  head. She was standing on the outskirts of the group, and could not see very
  well what was going on. The girl who started the discussion was still
  regarding the pendant carefully.</p>

  <p>"I have made a startling discovery," she cried. "Lady Mary, look at
  this."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary pressed forward curiously. She started as she saw the
  pendant.</p>

  <p>"May I have this in my hands for a few minutes?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, my dear. Examine it with pleasure. It is unique; they say
  there is nothing else quite like it in the world."</p>

  <p>The brilliant ruby with the diamonds so cunningly let into it sparkled in
  Lady Mary's hand. There was a queer, unsteady smile on her face as she
  examined it.</p>

  <p>"This is very strange," she murmured. "The Countess is quite justified in
  thinking her treasure is unique, but I have one exactly like it."</p>

  <p>A murmur of interest followed. The Countess looked up eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me where you got it from?" she asked. "It was a
  present, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. My husband gave it to me. Perhaps Baron Kinski had two of them.
  Of course, my husband knows the financier in question; at any rate, we'll ask
  him. James, will you find your master and say he is wanted for a moment?"</p>

  <p>The hall footman bowed, and departed on his errand. Maude waited for the
  result of the search with a certain feeling of grim amusement. She felt
  pretty sure that James would have trouble for his pains. Minter had not the
  slightest intention of meeting the Countess de Lary and he was keeping out of
  her way for that very reason. James came back presently.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, my lady," he said, "but I cannot find the master anywhere.
  Bronson seemed to think that he had gone to meet Mr. Murdock, who seems to
  have had an accident."</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't in the least matter," Lady Mary cried gaily. She did not
  see the smile on Maude's face. "I'll get mine, and we'll have a close
  inspection. I'll not be long."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary flitted away, to return presently with a little box in her hand.
  As she laid bare the contents a little cry of surprise went round.</p>

  <p>"Identically the same," Maude said. "Only the snap on Lady Mary's is
  different."</p>

  <p>"Because I had it changed," Lady Mary exclaimed, "but the snaps were
  identical. Can you see any difference? Is it not a wonderful likeness?"</p>

  <p>Nobody could see any difference in the artificial light.</p>

  <p>"Let us carry the investigation a step further," Maude suggested. "Isn't
  there a wonderful incandescent lamp rigged up in the blue morning-room for
  some purpose connected with the testing of diamonds? We shall know by the use
  of that."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary cried that here was the very idea. By that wonderful light the
  most searching investigation could be made. The blue morning-room was more or
  less given over to Minter, who kept his samples of ore and his maps there.
  The only luxury was a grand piano facing into the room, and, beyond it, the
  owner's pianola, for use when the mood was upon him.</p>

  <p>The great blazing arc of light was turned on; so brilliant was it that
  most of the spectators shaded their eyes. The rest of the room seemed in
  black darkness, and all that could be seen was a brilliant white shape of
  light with a white hand and arm, the hand holding the two precious gems. The
  rubies seemed to be absolutely transparent now, the light penetrated clean
  through.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you say?" Lady Mary asked at length.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to say," the bronzed man said as he switched out the
  light and restored the normal 'Robertson' lamps. "The gems are the same,
  probably a pair fashioned for some ancient order a great many years ago. It
  is very strange that one should come into the hands of Baron Kinski and the
  other into the hands of Mr. Graham Minter."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if they ever met?" Lady Mary asked.</p>

  <p>"I could not say," the Countess replied. She had laid her pendant on the
  mantelshelf for a moment. "But if I could see Mr. Minter&mdash;I hear his
  voice&mdash;That is his voice."</p>

  <p>All this in a whisper, heard only by Maude. Evidently the mad fit was
  coming on again. The hearing of an imaginary voice was a certain sign.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to the hall," Maude cried gaily. She literally forced the
  Countess before her. "In the morning Minter shall try and solve the mystery.
  Come along."</p>

  <p>They trooped out noisily, but Maude hustled her companion along till she
  had reached the drawing-room. It was empty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch40"
     id="ch40"></a>XL. MUSIC HATH CHARMS</h2>

  <p class="first">"NOW, you distinctly promised me that you would not excite
  yourself," Maude said reproachfully to the Countess de Lary.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, I heard his voice. There was a disturbance in the outer
  hall, and a lot of people speaking at once. And I most distinctly heard Baron
  Kinski's voice."</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't," Maude said sternly. It was no time for politeness. "Your
  mind was full of him and the new discovery, and you imagined it. Now, you are
  not to do anything of the kind again; at least, you are not to do so until I
  give you permission. What are you going to do when you leave here?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I have not the slightest idea. For reasons which I cannot go
  into, I dare not part with my diamonds. And for the present my money is
  exhausted. I have a little annuity, but it does not fall due again for some
  weeks, and I have no friends whatever in London."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes you have," Maude smiled. "I shall be here till about Tuesday, and
  when I go, you go with me. You are coming to pay a nice long visit to my
  mother and myself. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>Countess de Lary began to cry softly. It was so good, so kind, so
  generous. Maude felt a little guilty. She would have made the offer under any
  circumstances, but she could not rid her mind of the fact that she had in the
  first place been prompted by the idea of further discoveries.</p>

  <p>"There, that is settled," she said gaily. "Let us go into the billiard
  room."</p>

  <p>The disturbance in the outer hall had subsided. Outside some men were
  wheeling or dragging away the remains of what a little time before had been a
  fine Panhard. Mr. Murdock had arrived at last, but he had not brought his
  wife with him. She had been detained by some important business, and a stupid
  servant had quite forgotten to send off the necessary telegram of apology. As
  the trains fitted in awkwardly, Murdock had decided to run down by motor. He
  could not stay, as that important business still pressed, and he had to get
  back to London before daylight. All this he explained to the listless ears of
  Lady Mary. The heavy financier and his wife did not interest her much.</p>

  <p>"So sorry," she murmured with the most conventional politeness. "That
  dreadful business seems to upset everything. I can't imagine where my husband
  has gone to."</p>

  <p>The library door opened, and a white, anxious face looked out. The hall
  was fairly clear, so Minter stepped across.</p>

  <p>"I've been in the library if you have wanted me," he growled. "What's this
  fuss about? Come in here&mdash;no, the papers I want to show you are in the
  morning-room. This way, Murdock. And I am not to be disturbed by anybody, you
  understand, Mary."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded. She was relieved to get the Murdock business off her
  mind. When the door of the room was closed, Minter breathed freely again. He
  would have locked the door, but for the fact that it would have looked
  strange to the most important guest.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been knocked about," he said. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Murdock explained. He was a large, ponderous man, with an air of the most
  intense respectability. His very appearance was of utmost value at a meeting
  of angry shareholders. But the man rarely touched anything that was not
  absolutely sound, and his name stood high.</p>

  <p>"I got smashed up two miles off," he said. "No, I am not hurt; only I
  shall want you to lend me one of your cars presently to get back with. What
  are you doing there?"</p>

  <p>"I was just going to play an inpromptu of Chopin's on my pianola," Minter
  continued. "I am passionately fond of music; in fact, it's my one soft spot.
  I can't play myself, so this machine does it for me. If you've got any
  feeling&mdash;Would you like to hear it?"</p>

  <p>But Murdock's weakness did not lie that way. He was a plain, hard man, who
  looked upon art of all kinds as so much vice. He tapped his teeth
  thoughtfully with his glasses.</p>

  <p>"I've gone into your papers and figures," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Minter said carelessly. "And they are as I said they were?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. They appear to me quite satisfactory. But I can't touch
  them."</p>

  <p>Minter played a few bars of Chopin's lovely setting and stopped. He wanted
  time to recover his temper. He wanted to appear as if he did not care one way
  or another. He wanted to fly out at the smug financier and do him personal
  violence, if necessary. He got a grip of himself presently.</p>

  <p>"So you are going to back out of the concern?" he said quietly. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to me, it does not appear to be quite good enough. To be perfectly
  plain, I don't like the rumours that are going about concerning that
  Certified Company. I don't know where the rumours come from, but, in this
  case, they appear to be particularly well founded. They say that if the
  missing witness had turned up your case would not have been worth
  sixpence."</p>

  <p>Minter smiled disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Is that it?" he said. "Why don't they go further&mdash;why don't they say
  that I found the money for the plan that released Eli Price?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Minter, there are plenty of people who believe that too."</p>

  <p>Murdock spoke coolly and quietly enough. Minter laughed, but there was a
  snarl behind it, and he had great difficulty in keeping his voice steady. He
  felt the ground slipping from under his feet; he knew quite well why Murdock
  had not brought his wife. The urgent business was only an excuse to keep
  everything like a semblance of friendship out of the matter and render it
  according to commercial rules.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I've wasted your time and mine," Minter went on in his rasping
  voice. "I can see that you don't altogether trust me, and I don't blame you.
  But, if I had another good name behind mine, perhaps you might feel disposed
  to reconsider the matter?"</p>

  <p>Murdock admitted the possibility. If Minter had any suggestion to make,
  why&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is not a suggestion," the latter said. "It is a hard reality. Will you
  come in, once for all, if I can get Baron Kinski to come on the board?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now you are talking," Murdock cried. "That is a different matter
  altogether. Personally, I don't know Kinski; but if you can induce
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Consider the matter done. You shall have a cablegram to-morrow and a
  letter in due course."</p>

  <p>Murdock's white teeth were displayed in a brilliant smile. He had not
  hoped for anything quite so satisfactory as this. Baron Kinski was a
  financier who kept himself very much to himself, but at the present moment
  his name stood high, and he was reported to have vast wealth in America. It
  was true that there had been some business over a mad Countess, but then the
  courts had decided in Kinski's favour.</p>

  <p>"We could call it settled on those lines," Murdock said. "If you will see
  me on Monday&mdash;what's that?"</p>

  <p>A high-pitched voice rose outside&mdash;an excited voice, evidently that
  of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear no, I haven't <i>lost</i> it," she said. "I remember now
  perfectly well putting it on the shelf in the room. I'll get it in a
  moment."</p>

  <p>A smothered oath, so low that Murdock did not hear it, broke from Minter's
  lips. As the door opened, he rushed for the switch and turned off the light.
  To Murdock, whose mind did not work too rapidly, it seemed as if something
  had gone wrong with the circuit. The Countess advanced into the room, and in
  the light of the hall lamps, fumbled her way to the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"So there is somebody here," she said. "So sorry to disturb you, but I
  left something behind me just now. Ah, here it is. I felt quite
  certain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Minter's feet came on the pedals of the pianola, the masterpiece of Chopin
  was not more than begun. The keys began to speak, and the liquid melody to
  run off. Long before it was finished, that infernal woman would have gone
  away, Minter thought. Murdock sat there tapping his teeth with his glasses,
  and wondering if the strain of a great business was beginning to tell upon
  Minter's mind. To a blunt intellect like his, all this was so much frivolous
  nonsense.</p>

  <p>The wondrous liquid harmony ceased at length, the sounds of melody died
  away. Minter half rose from the pianola and drew a deep breath. He had
  escaped for the present. A figure moved in the centre of the room; there was
  a deep sigh of pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful," the Countess said gently. "Truly wonderful. What a soft,
  melting touch. My dear madam, I cannot see you, but <i>will</i> you play that
  again?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch41"
     id="ch41"></a>XLI. IMAGINATION</h2>

  <p class="first">THE figure at the piano said nothing. The shaft of light
  proceeding from the hall only threw the corner of the room where Minter was
  sitting into deeper gloom. He sat there awaiting events, hoping for the best,
  and yet fearful of results. Then Murdock helped him out of his difficulty.
  Murdock laughed.</p>

  <p>"My friend is shy," he said. His peculiarly pawky form of humour was
  tickled. It was seldom that he jested, but the whole thing struck him as so
  absurd that he could not refrain from amusement. "She is not used to perform
  in public."</p>

  <p>It was a slightly rude speech, all circumstances considered, and the
  Countess resented it. She could just see the out-line of Murdock's figure by
  the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"To whom have I the pleasure of speaking?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Murdock announced his name and address pompously. He liked the effect they
  generally produced. But the Countess was not in the least impressed by the
  presence of the millionaire. On the contrary, she gave a start and darted
  forward. At the same moment, Minter slipped from the room. He perspired
  freely, and his face was white.</p>

  <p>"So you are one of those capitalists?" the Countess exclaimed. "And I
  imagined my property to be safe here! Please turn on the light at once."</p>

  <p>Murdock fumbled for the switch by the door, and found it at last. With a
  mutter of satisfaction, the Countess snatched up her ruby and diamond pendant
  and left the room. To her disordered mind, a capitalist was another word for
  a thief.</p>

  <p>"I've got it!" she cried. "He couldn't possibly have known it was there,
  or I should never have seen it again. What a fortunate thing, Lady Mary!"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary agreed soothingly, though she had not the least idea what had
  happened. As she led the Countess away, Minter sneaked from behind a pile of
  palms and slipped into the morning-room again. Murdock regarded him
  suspiciously and sourly.</p>

  <p>"Is it some kind of play-acting you're doing?" he asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Minter replied. He had quite recovered himself.
  "That's Countess de Lary, you know. She's absolutely mad, and how she got
  here passes my comprehension. Probably some soft-heartedness on the part of
  my wife. It's a wonder she did not make a great scene when you told her who
  you were. I have to keep out of her sight in my own house to preserve the
  peace. She's been quite insane ever since that affair with Kinski."</p>

  <p>Murdock allowed the explanation to pass, for it seemed ingenious enough.
  And the man had not one ounce of imagination about him. He had come down on
  business, and that business had proved a great deal more satisfactory than he
  had expected. He had finished now, and the sooner he got back to London the
  better he would be pleased.</p>

  <p>"I'll get you to lend me a car," he said. "No; I'll not take
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Then we will go across to the stables this way," Minter said eagerly, as
  he pulled up the blind and opened the catch of the French window. "I'll have
  your <i>chauffeur</i> called up and find you a good car. I'll not fail to see
  you on Monday morning."</p>

  <p>On the whole, Minter was not displeased to see the back of his guest. He
  stood in the forecourt before the stables watching the big Panhard, with its
  flashing lamps, skimming like a great bird down the drive, and then he
  returned to the house. Somebody was in the morning-room now, for he could see
  shadows flickering across the blind. With a feeling of annoyance, Minter
  entered by the front door. Lady Mary was seeing a male guest off, the
  Countess had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Where's that old cat gone to?" Minter growled.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the Countess?" Lady Mary asked innocently. "She's in the
  gallery looking at the pictures. The poor old thing has a passion for
  art."</p>

  <p>"I daresay. Now, you take my advice and pack her off to bed, and get rid
  of her the first thing in the morning. She's a dangerous lunatic. And if I'd
  known that you were going to ask her down here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Graham, I didn't ask her. She is quite mad, poor thing, but
  perfectly harmless. She has spent her last few pence in coming down here to
  look for Baron Kinski. Maude Beaumont found her wandering about the park and
  brought her here properly enough. It was quite a fixed idea of hers that
  Kinski was here, and she is going to ruin him."</p>

  <p>"Poor Baron!" Minton sneered. "How does she propose to do that?"</p>

  <p>"She has some fresh evidence. She is very mysterious, but I fancy that
  there is a good deal of method in her madness, poor thing. She thinks the
  Baron has fled from here in disguise, and she is equally sure that she can
  penetrate that disguise."</p>

  <p>"Mad as a hatter," Minter growled. His eyes were red, and the coarse veins
  showed on his forehead. "Get rid of her, turn her out of the house, do you
  hear? By Heaven! if she is here after to-morrow morning I will do it myself.
  You understand me!"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary flushed and drew back. Minter seemed to be more coarse and
  vulgar than usual. The pressure of his grip almost amounted to pain.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you," she said, "and I see no reason for this
  violence. If you ask me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't ask you, I command you. That wretched old lunatic shall not
  remain under my roof any longer. After to-night she goes. Mind, I've said
  it."</p>

  <p>Minter stalked away down the corridor to his own particular den, where he
  was never disturbed under any circumstances. It was getting very late now,
  but he had no desire to go to bed. Nor did he desire human companionship in
  any form. He wanted to be alone, apart from those chattering Society idiots.
  He wanted to think, and his thoughts were by no means pleasant ones. There
  was danger pressing in upon him from more sides than one. He smiled to
  himself. How many of the gilded rats would be here if the true state of
  things were known?</p>

  <p>There was a mist before Lady Mary's eyes as she crossed the hall. That she
  had wrecked and ruined her life she had known for a long while; indeed, she
  had done the thing more or less deliberately. She feared her husband rather
  than disliked him. He was so strong and so cruel; he was cruel now. It seemed
  so dreadful for Minter to turn against this poor creature and order her out
  of the house. And she would have to go.</p>

  <p>Maude's quick instinct saw that something was wrong immediately.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, dear?" she asked. "What troubles you?"</p>

  <p>"It's that poor old soul!" Lady Mary said unsteadily. The poor old soul in
  question was still deep in her contemplation of the pictures. "Graham has
  been making a fuss. I tried to enlist his sympathy, but I might as well have
  tried to get sympathy from a shark. He says she shall leave the house the
  first thing in the morning, and he will keep his word."</p>

  <p>Maude made no comment. She had expected something like this; indeed, she
  would have been surprised if Minter had taken any other course of action.
  Seeing what she had seen, Maude's suspicions were generally confirmed. She
  smiled sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I hope Mr. Minter did not tell the Countess so much," she said.</p>

  <p>"No; he wouldn't see her at all. He seems to have a rooted horror of the
  poor old thing. He says she will some day become dangerously mad and do some
  mischief to some man of money. Maude, what can I do? I cannot turn the poor
  old dear out, and yet my husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hide her," Maude said coolly. "The house is big enough, in all
  conscience. Hide her away; leave her to me, and when I go back to London I'll
  take her along and see to her future. Have they put her bedroom close to
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I should do without you," Lady Mary sighed. "You are
  always such a comfort to me, Maude. And if anything happens I can say that
  you will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take the blame," Maude cried cheerfully. "Certainly. The man is not born
  yet&mdash;capitalist or not&mdash;who can successfully bully me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch42"
     id="ch42"></a>XLII. THE COUNTESS SEES A FACE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE lights were out in the big drawing-room, the gleam from
  upstair windows grew fainter. The last few stragglers had left the billiard
  and smoking-rooms, and the butler yawned behind them as he flicked out the
  electrics with a suggestion that even here people occasionally went to bed.
  Certain lights remained here and there, lakes of light in a black island of
  darkness; Marvyn Chase was too large a house to leave entirely unilluminated.
  It was possible to see in the corridor.</p>

  <p>Maude had seen Lady Mary in the hands of her maid, and had said "Good
  night." As she passed into the gallery where the famous pictures hung, she
  saw that the Countess was still there.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stand admiring the things all night?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear, they are magnificent. To me they are a constant joy. In my
  youth, I was always surrounded by works of art and beauty; to be deprived of
  them is a terrible loss. At one time I thought it would have affected my
  reason, but, of course, I was too strong-minded for that."</p>

  <p>Maude successfully hid her smile. It was amusing enough, but there was a
  pathetic side to it all the same. Very cleverly she drew the old lady into
  her room.</p>

  <p>"Sit down for a chat for a little while," she said. "Tell me about
  yourself. And this Baron Kinski. Why do you imagine that he is here
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>The Countess looked cautiously around her. She spoke in a deep
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I know that I can trust you," she said. "The man is here in
  disguise. Lady Mary may not know it; indeed, I am sure she does not. But I
  found the end of a cigarette he had been smoking and I heard his voice. They
  hang together. Our host is shielding that man from my vengeance. But I shall
  find him; I shall penetrate his disguise."</p>

  <p>"You think you would know him under any circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I am absolutely certain of it. Give me a little time and I shall
  succeed. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, you are going to bed," Maude said with firm good humour. "I'll
  take you there."</p>

  <p>She heard the door of the room next to hers close at last. It was very
  late, but Maude had not the slightest feeling of sleepiness. There was much
  to engage her thoughts. First there was the quarrel between her lover and the
  man she had pledged to marry. Desborough had brought it upon himself, and
  from the bottom of her heart, Maude was glad. It was only now that she was
  beginning to realize how she loathed and despised the man who had forced this
  match upon her. She was getting reckless and desperate, ready to take any
  means consistent with honour to get out of her promise.</p>

  <p>A clock somewhere sounded two; from outside came the booming bell note of
  a great dog. Maude thought about Gambit, and wondered if he had got home all
  right, and, if so, what the servants would think of the fact that he had one
  of his mistress's gloves in his mouth?</p>

  <p>What possible connection could there be between Graham Minter and the
  poor, mad lady in the next room? Minter knew Baron Kinski, and there the
  matter ended. But why was he so desperately anxious not to come face to face
  with Countess de Lary, and why had he crawled on his hands and knees to avoid
  it? It seemed very strange that a strong man like Graham Minter should go in
  bodily fear of a woman who was obviously deficient in intellect. Had they met
  at some previous time?</p>

  <p>But that seemed impossible, because Countess de Lary disclaimed even a
  personal knowledge of the millionaire. The more Maude thought of this the
  more puzzled she was, and the less she saw her way of turning this discovery
  to advantage.</p>

  <p>The note of the hound boomed out again, much closer this time. But Maude
  did not hear. In so big a place as this, with so great a value scattered
  about inside, it was absolutely necessary to keep watch-dogs, and doubtless
  this one was on the premises somewhere.</p>

  <p>But something was stirring in the next room. Maude wondered what it was.
  With a start, she saw the handle of her door turn; but she had no occasion
  for alarm, as the Countess came in. Her eyes were shining; she held something
  in her hands.</p>

  <p>"Take these for me," she said; "hide them. There are thieves about."</p>

  <p>Obviously the speaker had been asleep and was still dreaming. But Maude
  took the worn, shabby cases without protest.</p>

  <p>"Have you come straight here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I have been wandering about the house. I could not sleep; all the
  beauty and luxury reminded me too much of the old times. So I put on the wrap
  that Lady Mary lent me and I went all about the house. Then a face looked at
  me suddenly out of the darkness&mdash;an evil face, the face of a
  thief&mdash;and I was frightened. So I got my jewels from my room and I came
  to you."</p>

  <p>"And I shall take you back again," Maude said. "Lock your door, and you
  will be quite safe."</p>

  <p>The Countess admitted that she had never thought of that course. She
  seemed perfectly satisfied, and quite easy in her mind now. Of course, the
  face was all imagination, Maude told herself. Nevertheless, she listened at
  the head of the staircase, her mind strung to its highest tension.</p>

  <p>A creak, the rattle of a shutter, a hoarse whisper, and then silence.
  Somebody was getting into the house. Minter was still down in his den, as
  Maude pretty well knew for certain. She would go down and tell him. The
  stairs creaked under her, as stairs do on such occasions, but Maude went
  bravely on.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Across the park, in the darkness, Price proceeded with Macgregor moodily
  by his side. Their luck had not been exactly what they had expected, but it
  was better than they deserved. On the whole, Price considered that he had not
  done a bad thing for himself.</p>

  <p>"What's the game now?" Macgregor asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Get our machines and back to London," Price responded shortly. "If you
  only knew it, we were precious near to being caught to-night, thanks to that
  dog. We shall have to be more careful in the future. It's a good dog and a
  valuable dog, and I am fond of them, but before long Gambit must die. I
  prophesy that he will die by poison."</p>

  <p>"I'd do it cheerfully," Macgregor said. "People have no right to keep a
  dog like that. By Jove! there the beggar goes across the park."</p>

  <p>Price recognized with a thrill that the statement was true enough. The
  lithe body of the great hound passed slowly backwards and forwards as if the
  dog were looking for something. In fact, he was feathering after his own
  trail so as to pick up his homeward tracks again. For an hour or more he
  trotted backwards and forward whilst the men stood silently there reviling
  their own impotence. To move might bring the dog on their scent again, and if
  that happened they were doomed. They might try a tree, but afterwards, when
  daylight came and questions were asked, what then? Price did not like to
  think of it.</p>

  <p>"I'm going back," he said. "Anything is better than this."</p>

  <p>Macgregor followed with chattering teeth. Suddenly Gambit gave a whine, he
  dropped the glove, and proceeded to cover the ground more quickly. An
  execration burst from Price.</p>

  <p>"The dickens take all dogs," he said. "Here's a bit of cruel luck. Hang me
  if that brute hasn't picked up our trail again! He's going over all the
  ground we covered, and he'll be on us sooner or later. What are we to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Go to the house and hide somewhere there till daylight," Macgregor
  suggested. "The dog will be seen and questions asked. Miss&mdash;I mean the
  lady you know of&mdash;will see the brute and send him home again. After that
  we can watch our chance and slip away."</p>

  <p>"Well, one learns something from every fool," was the complimentary reply.
  "Get a move on you. I daresay Minter and Co. have gone to roost by this time.
  Given five minutes, and we shall be safe from that dog after all. Only don't
  make a noise."</p>

  <p>The house was reached at length, but none too soon, as Gambit had picked
  up a strong scent and was racing round the park towards the mansion. On the
  terrace Macgregor stood outside the blue-room window. The light was still
  burning as Minter had left it, the catch was unfastened. Macgregor's quick
  eye took the fact in like a flash. Cautiously he pushed the blind aside and
  looked in. He smote his thigh, and gave a little chuckle of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Here's hospitality," he whispered, "here's confidence. Open the latch and
  walk in. Not a soul in the room at all. Come along, my noble partner."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch43"
     id="ch43"></a>XLIII. IN THE BLUE ROOM</h2>

  <p class="first">PRICE grinned at the unexpected luck. Really, the servants
  in large houses are very careless, a fact that the predatory class counts
  upon. A set of decanters and glasses and a large silver box of cigarettes
  attracted Macgregor's attention. He stretched out a longing hand.</p>

  <p>"No liquor and no tobacco for Heaven knows how many weary hours," he said.
  "Don't see much sense in leaving tobacco at home myself."</p>

  <p>"I do," Price said grimly. "You never could wait patiently without
  smoking, though there's nothing more dangerous or more likely to give you
  away. Well, you can fill your pockets and have a drink, and then we'll be off
  as quietly as possible."</p>

  <p>Macgregor protested. There were lots of small yet valuable articles
  scattered about, and to leave them behind seemed like a sinful waste of
  golden opportunities. Besides, there was the dog. They were safe, it was
  true, for the present, but how were they going to get away again?</p>

  <p>"How you manage to get your living is a mystery to me," Price growled.
  "You're not going to touch one single thing. And, as to the dog, that's quite
  easy. Whilst he's nosing about outside here, we shall slip out of the front
  door. You stay here till I've found it."</p>

  <p>"And nothing to be taken?" Macgregor asked.</p>

  <p>"Not so much as a cold cinder. You fool, suppose we get picked up on the
  way home? Such things have happened before now and will again. Here we are
  with a fortune in our grip, and you want to spoil it for a £5 note. If you
  touch anything, I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price advanced so fiercely that Macgregor quailed.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said tartly, "what a bad-tempered fellow you are. You go
  and raise the portcullis whilst I stay here. Only it seems a pity not
  to&mdash;ah, <i>all</i> right, keep your hair on. Only I'll be glad to get
  back to London again."</p>

  <p>All this time Maude was listening at the top of the stairs. Not that she
  could hear a word of all this conversation, which was being carried on in
  whispers. All she felt was that somebody was in the house, and that Minter
  must be roused as quickly as possible. She felt pretty certain he would not
  have gone to bed yet, for she knew him and his habits.</p>

  <p>She was creeping down the stairs now when a shadow crossed the corridor.
  Maude looked up hastily. Doubtless the noise had aroused some other guest.
  She was just a little annoyed to see the Countess in her white wrap standing
  behind her.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear it?" she whispered. "Did you hear that noise?"</p>

  <p>Maude murmured something reassuring. She could not leave the other woman
  there, she felt that the fact of her going downstairs in a dressing-gown and
  with her hair all over her shoulders needed some explanation.</p>

  <p>"It is only your imagination," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then what are you after?" Countess de Lary said with a sudden shrewdness.
  "Why are you creeping about like this, I want to know? You heard that
  noise?"</p>

  <p>"I am going back for something that I have forgotten," Maude said. "But
  first I am going back to your room. You simply <i>must</i> stay there. As to
  your jewels&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are quite safe, you think? I am in a strange house, the house of one
  of those capitalists. It is only another word for a thief. I don't know Mr.
  Minter, but if he could get my jewels he would do so. They are all
  alike."</p>

  <p>Maude was biting her lips with vexation. Time was precious, and the poor
  old lady was keeping her waiting. Her whisper, too, was getting loud. Maude
  took her gently, but firmly, by the shoulder and piloted her back to the
  bedroom again.</p>

  <p>"You are not to move again," she commanded. "If you do, I shall refuse to
  be responsible for your gems. If you like, when I return, you may come and
  sleep in my room. But not if you are going to disobey my orders in this
  fashion."</p>

  <p>The bribe sufficed. With a patient little smile, the Countess promised to
  be good. Once again Maude crept down the stairs and into the hall, dimly
  lighted with one electric lamp in the large corona. It might have been fancy,
  but it seemed to the girl that she could hear whispering somewhere, that
  presently a dim form crossed the hall and disappeared.</p>

  <p>There were no lights in any of the main rooms, as Maude could see. She
  passed down two of the corridors before a little slit of flame seemed to cut
  into the darkness. That was from the morning-room, the French window of which
  opened on to the terrace. Maude would have to pass that door to reach
  Minter's sanctum. Her heart was beating a little faster now.</p>

  <p>Her foot caught against a stool and made a little noise, but the girl
  pushed resolutely forward. A burning curiosity took possession of her, a
  strong desire to see what was in the room. Burglars, as a rule, do not
  illuminate their proceedings with vivid electric lights, and it might be
  possible, after all, that Maude was mistaken. She pushed open the door and
  went in.</p>

  <p>Nobody there, she told herself with a sigh of relief. But that was not
  quite correct. The intruder, Macgregor, was there, examining the pictures
  round the walls. The man was quick enough, so far as resource was concerned,
  for he pushed the door to instantly and confronted the astonished Maude. It
  was only a woman, after all, Macgregor told himself.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what are you doing here?" Maude stammered.</p>

  <p>"I am waiting by appointment to see Mr. Minter," Macgregor replied. For
  the life of him, he could not keep that smirk from his face. He was a squire
  of dames in his way, and prided himself on his correct judgment where a
  pretty face was concerned. And here was the most beautiful woman, with the
  most wonderful hair, he had ever seen. "Is he likely to be long?"</p>

  <p>But Maude was not deceived, the smirk gave Macgregor away.</p>

  <p>"You are a cool scoundrel," she said. "Do people who come to see Mr.
  Minter at this late hour generally enter the house by means of the
  window?"</p>

  <p>The window might have been fastened, for all Maude knew to the contrary,
  but she made the shot. Macgregor laughed silently. It was the kind of
  adventure he liked.</p>

  <p>"I am here by stress of circumstances," he said. "I have an enemy outside
  who is literally thirsting for my blood. So long as I am here I am safe; in
  fact, I should not have been safe if that window had not been luckily open. I
  assure you I am telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"And you expect me to believe that and allow you to go?"</p>

  <p>"The ears of beauty are never deaf to the tones of distress," Macgregor
  said smoothly. "If you will permit me to depart by the front door I will be
  grateful."</p>

  <p>"I have not the slightest doubt about it. But such is far from being my
  intention."</p>

  <p>The smirk disappeared suddenly from Macgregor's face, and an ugly look
  took its place.</p>

  <p>"There are other methods of gaining my desire," he said. "For instance,
  you are weak and I am tolerably strong. And I have the advantage of the
  closed door on my side. Before you could give the alarm I could have you by
  that beautiful, slender, white throat of yours and choke the life out of you.
  I could gag you, and lock the door behind me. It would not be a pleasant
  thing to do, because I am a most humble and devoted admirer of your sex. On
  the other hand, the prospect of a long spell in gaol this lovely weather is
  not to be contemplated with equanimity."</p>

  <p>Maude followed this tirade more or less hazily. The man spoke more or less
  like a gentleman, he was most offensively at ease, but he looked like a
  tiger. The girl was repenting of her boldness. If she had passed on and
  called Minter, there would have been nothing of this.</p>

  <p>"You would not dare," she managed to say.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I would," Macgregor said with the ugly smile on his lips. "I
  dare most things. What does Shakespeare say on the subject? But never mind
  Shakespeare. Are you going to show me the front door, or shall I find it for
  myself?"</p>

  <p>The door opened behind Maude before her reply was ready.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch44"
     id="ch44"></a>XLIV. GRUDGING HOSPITALITY</h2>

  <p class="first">HOPE flickered up in Maude's breast for a moment. Doubtless
  her host had arrived, and he would very soon put a different complexion on
  the matter. But it was no dress-coated form that crept so slowly into the
  blue-room, but another man, the first intruder's accomplice, no doubt.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he whispered. "You can come along, Macgregor. Who
  the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price paused in astonishment, not unmixed with admiration. Maude could
  have laughed aloud, had not her anger got the better of her. She faced Price
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>"And this is the way you reward me!" she said. "This is why you came down
  here. Had I known, I would have allowed the dog to tear you in pieces."</p>

  <p>"If I may never speak again, you misjudge me," Price said in a hard
  whisper. "I'm telling the truth now, may I die if I'm not. We were going out
  of the park when the dog picked us up again. He was carrying something in his
  mouth, and I thought that you had sent him home&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So I had," Maude said. "I can't understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, the dog picked up our tracks again. We had to make a bolt for it,
  and so we came here. Our idea was to hide somewhere till the dog was
  discovered and called off and then make our escape. But we found the window
  open, and I suggested going through the house and out the other side. If it
  hadn't been for the dog, we should have been in London before now."</p>

  <p>The man was telling the truth, Maude felt certain of that. All her fear
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I had better let you out," she said. "There is a side door
  here that will save going across the hall. I know where the key is kept."</p>

  <p>"Half a moment," Macgregor said eagerly. "Allow me most humbly to beg your
  pardon; I used language just now, under a mistaken impression, of course,
  that I should not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No apology is needed," Maude said. "I quite understand. The sooner you
  are gone the better."</p>

  <p>"Step outside for a minute," Price said, "and close the door behind
  you."</p>

  <p>Macgregor winked discreetly and disappeared. Price hesitated some little
  time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I hope you believe me," he said. "I assure you nothing is missing here. I
  have too big a game to play to think of this paltry little thing at present.
  Would you like to have Minter under your thumb?"</p>

  <p>"It would be useful," Maude said, suppressing her eagerness, "very useful.
  In fact&mdash;but go on."</p>

  <p>"I can't go on for the present, my plans are not yet quite definite. But
  I'm going to do it. You have done me a good turn, and Eli Price never forgets
  that. But when the time comes, I'll not fail to let you know."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, you had better be going," Maude said. "I'll get the key, and
  you can let yourself out. Presently I will come down again and lock the door.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>The key was procured, a sort of latch-key for emergencies, and was handed
  over to Price. Maude ran swiftly towards the stairs, but, as she did so, her
  foot caught in the edge of an armed figure, the shock dislodging the helmet,
  which clanged upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"Be quick," she whispered. "Mr. Minter has not gone to bed. Not for worlds
  would I have him know that I have been talking to you. And that noise is sure
  to disturb him."</p>

  <p>Maude flew up the stairs and into the room of the Countess. She had
  forgotten all about her troubles and suspicions now, for she lay on her bed
  fast asleep. At any rate, there was something to be thankful for. Behind the
  closed doors Maude listened intently, but no sound could she hear. No doubt
  the intruders had got safely away by this time, and Minter had found the
  cause of the commotion. He would naturally conclude that the helmet had
  fallen off, and there would be an end to the matter. But, on the whole, it
  had been a narrow escape, and Maude had no desire to repeat the
  experience.</p>

  <p>To have a hold over Minter, too! The mere thought caused Maude to glow to
  her finger tips. Once given that, she could see her way. On the whole, it had
  been a good night's work when she first made the acquaintance of her rascally
  brother-in-law, and any stick was good enough to beat a dog with. If
  everything went well, she might be free yet.</p>

  <p>But things downstairs were not going altogether as Maude could have
  wished. The key of the door was in the lock, but the wards refused to turn.
  Price shook it passionately.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" Macgregor asked with his teeth chattering.</p>

  <p>"Key stopped up," Price replied. "A bit of fluff down the barrel, or
  something of that kind. Fancy all this owing to a bit of fluff. Got a pin
  about you?"</p>

  <p>But Macgregor did not possess that trivial but useful article. He only
  hoped that the master of the house had not been aroused by the clang of the
  falling helmet. Price tugged away, but all in vain.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to go back by the way we came," he said. "Perhaps the dog's
  gone now; it's all a chance. Good thing Minter did not come out upon us."</p>

  <p>But Minter was not so deaf as Price had fondly imagined. He had heard the
  noise of the falling helmet, and his suspicious nature told him that somebody
  was in the house. But how had they got there? Like a flash it came upon him
  how he had taken Murdock to the stables by means of the French window, the
  fastening of which he had forgotten. The thieves had entered the house that
  way and would return by the same exit.</p>

  <p>Whatever Minter's faults were, he had no lack of physical courage. Nature
  had not given him that hard mouth and square jaw for nothing. He smiled
  grimly to himself as he took a loaded revolver from a drawer and let himself
  out into the night by means of his window, taking care to lock his door
  behind him so that there should be no loophole for the burglars.</p>

  <p>All he saw was a dark shadow of a dog moving restlessly about. One of his
  own dogs, no doubt. He came to the blue-room; he smiled again to find the
  lights burning brilliantly there. As he stepped into that room, Macgregor
  entered by the door. A second and he was looking down into the blue rim of a
  revolver barrel and reviling his fate silently.</p>

  <p>"Hands up," Minter said. "I've got you fairly this time. Any weapon about
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't work in that way," Macgregor said sullenly. "Besides, it's
  dangerous. I'm not armed."</p>

  <p>"Then you can sit down in that chair," Minter said in high good humour.
  "Help yourself to cigarettes and a drink. They are likely to be the last you
  will get for some time."</p>

  <p>Macgregor complied with a shaking hand. His glass clinked against his
  teeth as he raised it. He wondered vaguely what Price was doing all this
  time. He had shot back directly he had caught sight of Minter. Perhaps by
  this time he was speeding across country. But Price was not that sort. He
  prided himself on the virtue of always sticking to a pal. Doubtless he was
  thinking of something now. Macgregor looked uneasily at the door.</p>

  <p>Minter followed his glance, and detected his thoughts instantly.</p>

  <p>"So you are not alone?" he said. "There is another man. I'll soon settle
  this."</p>

  <p>He pushed the door to and raised his revolver. Before he could fire and
  give the necessary alarm, the door burst open and Price gripped his arm.
  Minter turned savagely in expectation of a struggle, but Price did not mean
  to fight for a moment; his face clearly proved that.</p>

  <p>"Hold hard," he panted. "No reason to make a fool of yourself in that way.
  You've caught me fairly out, but I've got the grip on you, and we could
  murder you between us now despite your courage. You've forced my hand, my
  dear sir, but really it doesn't much matter."</p>

  <p>"And who may you be?" Minter asked with well simulated curiosity.</p>

  <p>Price dropped in a chair and laughed in his horribly silent fashion. He
  was always at his worst, he was always in his most dangerous mood when he did
  that. He took a cigarette and lighted it, he poured down his throat a liberal
  measure of brandy as if it had been water.</p>

  <p>"I am Eli Price," he said. "I am the escaped convict who did <i>not</i>
  give evidence in the Certified Company case. And you pretend not to know
  me."</p>

  <p>"I'll have you locked up before morning," Minter said.</p>

  <p>Price laughed again in the same horrible, silent fashion.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," he said. "You <i>dare</i> not. Ring the bell, Minter.
  Call in the police. Sound the loud timbal, blow the trumpets, and all the
  rest of it. Why don't you do it, Minter? I'm quite prepared to face the music
  if you are. And my price is £100,000."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch45"
     id="ch45"></a>XLV. PUTTING ON THE SCREW</h2>

  <p class="first">MINTER dropped into a chair and surveyed his unwelcome
  guests quite steadily. The man's nerve was not what it had once been, and he
  had been sorely tried lately, but he could cope with these two. There was a
  battle coming, and his courage rose to it.</p>

  <p>"You rascal," he said. "I could shoot you both on sight, and the law would
  hold me blameless. I should merely say that I caught you in the act of
  burglary, and there would be an end of the matter. I daresay your pockets,
  too, are full of valuables."</p>

  <p>"They're full of nothing of yours," Price said. "I've got a better game
  than that. We shouldn't have been here at all, but for a confounded dog which
  tracked us down. My friend found the window unfastened, and we were simply
  going to get through the house and give that dog the slip."</p>

  <p>Minter laughed scornfully. At the same time, he had a feeling that Price
  was speaking the truth.</p>

  <p>"And you expect me to believe that?" he said. "What do you take me
  for?"</p>

  <p>"I take you for an unmitigated scoundrel," Price replied. "I take you for
  something precious near a pauper. You may grasp the right end of the stick
  and come out of it a millionaire in the proper sense of the word, and, if so,
  you'll have to pay my share of it. I know all about it; I know why you paid
  to get me out of the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>"You dog, I'm going to send you back where you came from!"</p>

  <p>Minter spoke ferociously, but there was no sting in the threat. Price
  smiled as he helped himself to another cigarette. He was master of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Cut it," he said. "You are armed, and you know how to handle a revolver
  as well as most men. If that's your game, ring up your servants and call the
  police. What are you waiting for? Shall I tell you why you don't!"</p>

  <p>"Because I am waiting to hear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie. You are afraid to do anything. Go down into the cellar and
  get me a bottle of champagne. Let it be the best. Get a move on you, or I'll
  ring the bell certain."</p>

  <p>Minter tried to smile contemptuously. But, as Price crossed over and
  actually rang the bell loudly, his manner changed. For the time being, he was
  beaten.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake drop that nonsense!" he said hoarsely. "What are you
  driving at?"</p>

  <p>Price came back to his seat. He was master of the situation, and he knew
  it. Unless Minter had him privately murdered&mdash;which he was quite capable
  of doing&mdash;he was bound to win.</p>

  <p>"Now you are beginning to talk English," he said. "I know everything. You
  had me got out of the way because I was a stumbling-block to you. Ericsson
  managed it. But at that time you never anticipated trouble over the Certified
  Company business, or that I might prove so valuable a witness. I had to be
  silenced at all hazards, hence the plot to get me out of the hands of the
  police. But you had two strings to your bow, though you didn't quite trust
  Desborough. Ah, ah!"</p>

  <p>Minter started, and Price laughed silently in that dangerous way of
  his.</p>

  <p>"You've got Desborough under your thumb, and you fancy he is all right
  now. But you haven't got me under your thumb, and you are never likely to. If
  ever I do find myself in the witness-box, I shan't give Mr. Desborough a
  chance of evading important questions. I shall tell everything. If I do that,
  you are ruined&mdash;stock, lock, and barrel."</p>

  <p>"And you'll go back to gaol for months," Minter snarled. "What then?"</p>

  <p>"What then? A fool's question that. Suppose there is somebody working
  against you who will make it worth my while to stand the racket?"</p>

  <p>Minter's heavy jaw dropped. He had not anticipated anything like this.
  Still, it was possible. He marvelled to find that Price knew so much. It
  looked like a case of paying again.</p>

  <p>"What do you want from me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The answer is easy. I want £100,000 to hold my tongue, and perhaps more
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Modest request!" Minter said bitterly. "Where do you expect to get it
  from?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not from you at present, for the simple reason that you are not
  worth it," Price said coolly. "I'll take bills at long dates; your name and
  another one on the back of them."</p>

  <p>Minter laughed aloud. This man might be cunning, but he had a poor notion
  of business.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible," he said. "Why, you would be blown upon directly. And
  who do you suppose would back my bills to the extent of a hundred thousand
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>Price reached across the table and whispered in Minter's ear. He only said
  one word, and that word was Kinski. Minter's florid face grew pale, his eyes
  opened to their fullest extent. He might have been a craven coward listening
  to his own death sentence.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," he said. "I haven't the remotest idea what you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes you have," Price sneered. "He's your greatest friend. The Baron
  would do anything for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I know everything about him. I know where he came from and how he made
  his money, and where he is to be found at the present moment. Why, he is so
  fond of you that he actually takes a house next yours in Park Lane. He'll
  back your bills right enough."</p>

  <p>Minter took up a cigarette, but he did not light it for a moment. His face
  and voice were fairly under control, but he could not stay the violent
  trembling of his hands, and he wanted to conceal the fact. He would have
  liked to strike Price's smiling, sneering face; he would have liked to
  strangle him.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know everything," he said with a faint effort at sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"I do know everything," Price replied. "It's a deep game, but you are
  going to play it as much for my benefit as your own, sonny. And I'm not a bit
  afraid of treachery on your part. If you play me false, I tell the whole
  truth and get my money from the other side, sweetened by the satisfaction
  that I have ruined you body and soul."</p>

  <p>Minter silently admitted the logic. Price was master of the situation for
  the present.</p>

  <p>"Would you know Baron Kinski's signature if you saw it?" Minter asked.</p>

  <p>"I might not be able to swear to it," Price admitted. "But if I saw the
  noble baron sign those bills, that would get out of the difficulty, wouldn't
  it? On serious consideration that's the best plan; in fact, I'll stand by and
  see you both sign."</p>

  <p>Price spoke with a leer, and with his tongue in his cheek. Macgregor sat
  there puzzled, but interested, and with a feeling that Price was getting the
  best of it all along the line. Minter managed to light his cigarette at last.
  He was utterly and absolutely beaten, but to resign with a good grace was not
  in him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you must have your own way," he growled. "But these things
  can't be done in a hurry. Under ordinary circumstances, I would ask you to
  come and see me in my offices on Monday, but we had better conduct the
  business by correspondence."</p>

  <p>Price nodded. He had no wish to draw Minter into the compounding of a
  felony. He had all the cards in his hands; he had no fear of Minter playing
  him false. He poured himself out another glass of brandy, and coolly filled
  his pockets with cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"We're keeping you up," he said. "Now that the business is settled, I'll
  go. I'll wire you my address, where I shall expect to hear from you in a few
  days. Let me once turn the bills into money, and you may die prosperous and
  respected, for all I care. I'll be off to Paris. Come along."</p>

  <p>"Better go as you came," Minter suggested.</p>

  <p>"Beware of the dog," Price replied. "The front door, please. I didn't mean
  to make myself known to-night, but circumstances were too strong for me.
  Funny, isn't it, to think that you should have done me so good a turn without
  intending anything of the kind. Ta, ta, Minter."</p>

  <p>Minter growled something by way of a reply as he led the way to the door.
  He ought to have shot those two rascals and taken the consequences, he told
  himself. He could easily have done it, and then filled their pockets with
  portable property afterwards. And now there was a millstone about his neck,
  that threatened to drown him if he were not very careful.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch46"
     id="ch46"></a>XLVI. A COLLAPSE</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE had not gone to bed yet. She had to make sure that the
  men were off the premises and the key of the side door restored to its proper
  place. Then there was the dog to be got rid of. If Gambit were seen about the
  premises in the daylight questions might be asked. By this time doubtless the
  two men would be far away, and Gambit would probably go home.</p>

  <p>Maude waited for a little time without hearing anything, and then she
  crept downstairs. No doubt the fall of that helmet had not disturbed Minter.
  Encouraged by this feeling, Maude went along the corridor till she came to
  the blue morning-room. She would go out by the window and give Gambit a
  severe scolding for his disobedience, and incidentally she would fasten that
  window. It was not pleasant to sleep in a great house like this filled with
  treasures, and in the knowledge that the window was unlatched.</p>

  <p>To Maude's intense surprise, the room door was closed, and there were
  people talking inside. The door was a thick one, and it was impossible to
  hear what was going on inside, but Maude made out Minter's voice and the hard
  tones of Price.</p>

  <p>"Now, whatever does this mean?" she asked herself. "They are not
  quarrelling, or they would speak louder. How did they come together like
  this? I wish that door were thinner; I wish I could hear it. It sounds
  dishonourable, but under the circumstances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Maude could hear nothing. It was dangerous to stand there, for the
  door might be opened at any moment and her presence discovered. She would go
  back to bed again; at any rate, Price would not betray the fact that she had
  any hand in the business.</p>

  <p>The Countess was sleeping more lightly and murmuring to herself. She did
  not seem to be quite easy in her mind. Presently Maude heard suppressed
  voices downstairs, the creak of a door, and the rattle of a key. Beyond
  doubt, Minter was seeing his undesirable guests off the premises. But would
  he think to lock the window? The doubt disturbed Maude.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to sit up a little longer and see to it
  herself. Maude sat trying to interest herself in a book, and devoutly wishing
  that Minter would come upstairs soon. But Minter was not going to do anything
  of the kind. Price had effectively spoilt his night's rest, and he was in no
  mood for sleep. He paced up and down his room like a caged animal.</p>

  <p>"Where the dickens did that fellow get his information from?" he muttered
  savagely. "I thought it was all between Desborough and myself and
  Bigglestone. Maude Beaumont knows, of course; but then Price never got his
  facts from her; and yet he knows all about it, which means that I have
  powerful foes, who are working underground. And Kinski, too. Do <i>they</i>
  know about Kinski? If that is so, and the Certified Company goes wrong, I'm
  done. There will be an almighty smash, and I shall end in a gaol. And, if
  things go right, I shall never miss the price of that rascal's silence."</p>

  <p>For a long time Minter paced up and down the room, muttering to himself.
  He had lost all count of time; he had almost forgotten where he was. What
  would all these gilded butterflies upstairs say if they knew the facts of the
  case? It was a toss-up either way; lots of big men who had heavy balances
  behind them to-day had stood in Minter's shoes and pulled through. They were
  successful scoundrels, and they had never been found out.</p>

  <p>"I'll try the girl again," Minter determined. "If I can discover where she
  got her information from I shall be on the right track. It's easy to fight an
  enemy that one can see, but this burrowing arrangement is the very dickens.
  Maude Beaumont is clever, but in the end she will be no match for me. I'll
  forget all about it for the present."</p>

  <p>But this was easier said than done. Minter wandered about restlessly; his
  brain seemed to be on fire. He longed to be away in some lonely spot, where
  he had nothing to do but eat and sleep. Even his iron constitution had been
  sorely tried of late. In a restless way he sat down to the pianola. It was
  very late, and he might disturb his guests, but he cared nothing for that.
  Why should they be sleeping so peacefully whilst his mind was all
  inflamed?</p>

  <p>He reached over and took Beethoven's Appassionata from its box. The tones
  of the rich, quivering melody filled the house. There was nothing mechanical
  about Minter's playing; he was a master of the instrument, which in skilful,
  feeling hands can be made to speak as Rubinstein and the rest made their
  music speak. Music was the one soft spot in Minter's nature; it was a craze
  with him. He put his heart in his melody now; it tingled to the tips of his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Maude came downstairs more boldly. The sonata was a long one, she knew.
  Minter would not stop until he had finished, and so she would have time to
  admonish Gambit and fasten that window. Gambit was still raging up and down
  outside, and he came to Maude's call with a shamed air. A few hearty cuffs on
  his long, drooping ears did as much good as a sound thrashing. Maude pointed
  sternly towards the drive, and Gambit disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Maude crept back and fastened the window gently. Thank goodness that was
  done. The music was still going on as she advanced towards the stairs.
  Suddenly it broke off, and from Minter's room came a sharp cry, as of a
  strong man in pain.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation Maude entered. She saw Minter leaning over
  the pianola, his features all drawn up; there were big drops on his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Are you really ill?" Maude asked. "I came down for something that I had
  forgotten, and I heard you cry out as if you were in dreadful pain. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Minter came to himself with an effort. His face was still grey, and his
  eyes fixed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said with an effort to breathe. "It's here, in the
  centre of my chest. I have had it more than once lately when I have worried
  very much."</p>

  <p>"If you would like me to telephone for the doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment. He'll tell me to rest, or something of that kind. Just
  as if a busy man like myself can ever find time to rest! If it's really
  serious, why it <i>is</i> serious, and there's an end of the matter. I'm
  better now."</p>

  <p>Maude listened with a sympathy that was not in the least assumed. In the
  presence of pain and suffering, she was her sweet self at once. She urged the
  plea of the doctor again, but Minter shook his head as he resumed his seat
  once more.</p>

  <p>"It will pass," he said, "the music soothes me. There is one thing I
  should like, if you could possibly manage to get it for me without trouble,
  and that's a little sal-volatile. A good strong dose of it very often takes
  the pain away."</p>

  <p>The sal-volatile was fortunately close at hand; indeed, Maude had given
  the Countess a wineglassful of it earlier in the evening. As she flew
  upstairs the music rang out once more as if nothing had happened, but the big
  drops were still on Minter's forehead, and the difficulty of breathing
  remained.</p>

  <p>Maude poured out a liberal dose of the powerful medicine, and filled the
  glass up with water. As she left the room, the Countess stirred and opened
  her eyes. She was wide awake in an instant, listening with all her ears to
  the lovely, rippling music, with its rising and falling note of passion.
  Music to her was as the very air she breathed. She sat up entranced.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked. "A master, a veritable master. I must get up."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the kind," Maude commanded. "If you stir from your
  bed, I shall go downstairs and have the piano locked up. Do you understand
  that?" The old lady ducked down immediately, and closed her eyes as if she
  meant sleep at once. It seemed to Maude that she could leave her there in
  peace. Her strong will conquered the other's weakness. And still the tones of
  the melody floated in.</p>

  <p>"There is a good strong dose," Maude said. "Drink it at once."</p>

  <p>"That's better," he said, "it seems to act like magic. When I've finished
  this thing I shall go to bed. I won't forget your kindness to-night."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch47"
     id="ch47"></a>XLVII. THE COUNTESS FINDS OUT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE man looked utterly weary and fagged out. There was no
  semblance of the successful man of business about him now. By sheer strength
  of will he kept himself from the spirits on the table, for he had a full
  contempt for the people who seek courage that way.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything more that I can do for you?" Maude asked gently.</p>

  <p>"No, nothing. You are a good girl, and I have treated you very badly. I'd
  like to know one thing, however. Do you really and truly care for Clifford
  Desborough?"</p>

  <p>Minter asked the question with all his old cunning and swiftness. There
  was no impertinent curiosity about it, and the hot blood flamed into Maude's
  cheeks from no feeling of resentment. Her eyes met his steadily as she
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I do not care for him at all," she said. "There are reasons why I am
  bound to marry him. I shall be utterly miserable, because I despise the man,
  and my heart is given to another. Not that the latter fact is likely to
  appeal to you."</p>

  <p>Minter looked round the room as if his mind were far away.</p>

  <p>"You are wrong there," he said quietly. "I had a heart once, and there was
  a woman who cared for me. And she died&mdash;practically of starvation. If
  she had lived, I might&mdash;I am sure I should&mdash;have been different.
  Ah, you undergo what I have suffered, and you will think that money is
  everything...But I wasn't going to say that. If I go under, you come to me
  and I will show you a way to get rid of Desborough."</p>

  <p>"I should prefer for you to show me now," Maude said coldly.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that; it would interfere with my plans. No, no; I am not going
  to be sentimental; each for himself. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Minter waved Maude out of the room; he was his own hard self again. The
  girl heard him humming a little tune to himself as he went to his own room.
  Her head was getting heavy now; a great sense of fatigue was upon her. She
  would put everything aside and sleep now. She passed into the bedroom where
  she had left the Countess de Lary, feeling very much like a mother who has
  the care of a peevish and intractable child. She had promised to hide the old
  lady, and the responsibility&mdash;</p>

  <p>Maude gasped as she looked at the bed. It was empty. Perhaps the patient
  had wakened up and wandered into the other bedroom. But she was not there. Of
  course, the music had been the source of all the trouble. It had preyed upon
  the brain of the poor creature without doubt, and she set out to find whence
  the melody came.</p>

  <p>Maude crushed down her feeling of vexation and anger. She was very tired,
  but, all the same, she could not go to bed until she had found the wanderer.
  After all, the poor creature was not responsible for her actions. Doubtless
  she was rambling about the house somewhere. For the first time, Maude felt
  sorry that she had undertaken this obligation.</p>

  <p>From the top of the house she walked downwards, lighting and shutting off
  the electrics generally. It was not until she reached the hall that she came
  upon the object of her search. She was pacing up and down the hall with the
  lights full on, her bare feet cold as ice from contact with the marble floor.
  There was a queer smile on her face; she did not seem to realize that she was
  doing anything in the least out of the common.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't sleep," she said! "lately I am greatly troubled that way. So I
  came down to look at the pictures. The music disturbed me, too, that divine
  music. Have you any idea when it is going to commence again?"</p>

  <p>"The musician has gone to bed," Maude said crisply. "I have just said
  good-night to him. You will have to wait till to-morrow. Come along."</p>

  <p>"My dear, you must not speak to an old lady like that again in that tone
  of voice. It is not polite; in my young days it would never have been
  tolerated. You will please to remember that I am not your visitor, but the
  guest of Lady Mary Minter."</p>

  <p>Maude repressed her rising anger. The prospects of getting to bed were
  anything but favourable, and she was dead tired. The Countess' passing
  annoyance was light as a summer cloud, and she was smiling again.</p>

  <p>"We will go up in a few minutes," she said. "My dear, you have been very
  kind to me. The only thing you will not do is to tell me whether Baron Kinski
  is staying in the house or not. I fancied that I had found him some time ago;
  in fact, I was almost certain of it. But I must have been mistaken, because
  he was playing the piano."</p>

  <p>"Baron Kinski is a great musician?" Maude asked, painfully struggling with
  a yawn.</p>

  <p>"He does not know one note of music from another. Of that I am certain. I
  felt sure I had him to-night; I tracked him by his cigarettes. And in the
  room was another capitalist, so that, had they known, I should have lost my
  lovely pendant. And, behold, the man I thought was the Baron was making the
  most lovely music in the world. He was a shy man."</p>

  <p>"Musicians generally are," Maude said with another yawn.</p>

  <p>"He was in the dark. He put the lights down. And the other man, the
  capitalist, was listening. I did not imagine that those people had souls for
  anything but money. Still, it was one of Chopin's impromptus, and such lovely
  music. I asked the gentleman to play again, and, whilst I was getting my
  pendant, he slipped from the room. But I must meet him again."</p>

  <p>Maude had no doubt that the matter could be easily arranged. How much
  longer was her companion going to sit there, alert and clear-eyed, she
  wondered.</p>

  <p>"I'll do all I can for you," she said. "Meanwhile, do come to bed. I can
  hardly keep my eyes open, and you will catch your death of cold on this
  marble floor. Besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude was about to explain what a piano player was, but checked herself.
  Evidently the Countess had never heard of the thing, and it would mean a
  cascade of questions.</p>

  <p>"Music is a passion with me," the Countess went on. "I could listen for
  weeks. And the piano I heard was a lovely instrument. Let me go and see
  it."</p>

  <p>"If you promise to come to bed immediately after," Maude said.</p>

  <p>The desired promise was given. Maude had forgotten all about the pianola
  by this time. She walked across to the blue-room in a kind of waking dream;
  the lights hurt her eyes; she dropped into a chair, and was practically
  asleep before the high voice of the Countess aroused her.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" she exclaimed. "Come here! I am old-fashioned and out
  of the world sometimes, and there are many new things with which I am not
  familiar. How does this play?"</p>

  <p>"It is more or less mechanical," Maude explained. "The music plays from
  rolls of paper, and you put the expression into it yourself. The execution is
  perfect; indeed, nobody can <i>play</i> as this marvel plays. If you have no
  feeling, no soul for music, it is more or less like a barrel organ, but an
  expert on this instrument can work wonders. It is superb."</p>

  <p>"And that is what I heard to-night. Why did you not tell me before?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wanted you to go to sleep; because it was no use to bother your
  head. You shall hear it to-morrow; indeed, I am considered very good at it
  myself. And now do come to bed, and to-morrow I will explain all these keys
  and catches to you."</p>

  <p>The Countess looked up with longing doubt upon her face.</p>

  <p>"And that is what I heard to-night," she said. "On your honour, that is
  what I heard to-night?"</p>

  <p>Maude suitably responded to the excited question.</p>

  <p>"And the man at the piano did not probably know a note of music. He left
  the room as soon as he could after I had entered. Because he was musical, I
  came to the conclusion that he could not possibly be Baron Kinski. But the
  Baron might play <i>that</i> thing; he might pass in the dark for a mighty
  musician. I am right, right after all."</p>

  <p>"Right in what?" Maude asked. She only seemed able to think with one side
  of her brain.</p>

  <p>"Right in saying that Baron Kinski is in the house, my dear. He was
  playing the instrument. Let me go to bed instantly. I want a clear brain in
  the morning."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch48"
     id="ch48"></a>XLVIII. DANGER FOR MINTER</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE'S task was rendered easier than she had expected by
  the fact that the Countess was unable to leave her bed the next day. The
  exposure had brought on a severe chill, and the doctor was pretty firm on the
  point that she must stay where she was for the present.</p>

  <p>"Please send us a nurse," Lady Mary asked. "A strong-minded nurse, doctor,
  for your patient wants firm handling. And I wish you would see my husband
  whilst you are here. He has a violent headache, and seems to have lost all
  his energy."</p>

  <p>Minter was in bed also, and likely to remain there for the day. But he
  stoutly refused to have anything to do with the doctor. He had business of
  vital importance in London on the morrow, and any suggestion that he should
  lie by and rest was absolutely out of the question.</p>

  <p>Maude went peacefully off to church, glad to get away from her troubled
  thoughts for the time. She would have a quiet and peaceful Sunday, at any
  rate. It was all the more peaceful because Desborough did not show up. He had
  had a fall in his bedroom and hurt his face, so he told Lady Mary at
  breakfast-time, and he would therefore spend most of the day in his own room.
  He was fearfully busy, too, a pile of briefs called aloud for his immediate
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Make the best of your time," he said to Maude, as she stood in the hall
  sorting out her prayer and hymn books. "Enjoy the society of Clive whilst you
  have the chance. I shall call upon you when you return to town, and things
  will have to be definitely settled by then."</p>

  <p>Maude bowed coldly, but her face flushed.</p>

  <p>"As you please," she said. "I want to save you if I can, but you make it
  very hard for me. What should you say if I were to dispose of my fortune, if
  I turned it into money or bestowed it on some hospital? Would you be so eager
  to marry me then?"</p>

  <p>"You would not be so foolish," Desborough said uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sure of that," Maude said. "A desperate woman will do strange
  things if you push her too far. And God knows that I am a desperate
  woman."</p>

  <p>Desborough went back to his room and his work with an uneasy mind. In any
  case, he would not let Maude go now. She had stood by and seen Clive strike
  him; she had even taken a pleasure in the blow. The fact that Desborough had
  brought it all on himself did not lessen the sting. It was with him all day;
  it was still with him as he returned to London on Monday morning. He would
  have to wait his chance with Maude, for she had decided to remain where she
  was for the present. But Clive had come up by the same train to take Minter's
  place if possible.</p>

  <p>"I can hardly move my head," the millionaire groaned. "Fancy being kept
  here like this at such a time. An hour in the City now would be worth a year
  to me; my fortune hangs upon it. Connect my private telephone wire so that I
  can get it up here."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary made the sufferer as comfortable as possible, and left him to
  his own devices. This was to have been a critical day in the fortunes of the
  capitalist; he was to have met Murdock in the City and settled the business
  by bringing Baron Kinski in. And here he was laid by the heels like a weak
  dog, and nobody capable of doing the right thing by himself.</p>

  <p>He lay there with towels over his racking head until the telephone was
  fixed and the receiver was close to his elbow. Then he felt a little easier
  in his mind. He liked to see the men he was doing business with, to look into
  their eyes and read their inmost thoughts.</p>

  <p>He was half asleep when the sharp tinkle of the bell brought him to his
  senses. He groaned with the physical pain as he turned round and demanded
  what was wanted.</p>

  <p>"I'm here," he said. "I shall be here, confound it, all day. Is that you,
  Mellor? Mr. Murdock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just been here, sir," came the reply. "Between ourselves, he does not
  seem to imagine that there is anything the matter with you at all. He thinks
  that you are trying to gain time."</p>

  <p>"I wish he had my head," Minter gasped viciously. "Is there anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else at present, sir. I'll let you know if things are going
  wrong."</p>

  <p>Minter waited impatiently for the best part of an hour before the bell
  rang again. That something had gone very much astray he could tell by
  Mellor's voice. Ugly rumours had got abroad concerning Certified shares, and
  there was a sharp drop in them. Murdock had not come back again, and he was
  holding aloof for the present. What was to be done?</p>

  <p>"Nothing for the next few hours," Minter said. "Let the bears have their
  head. I shall astonish them before the day is out. Stay where you are, so
  that I can be in touch with you as I want you."</p>

  <p>Minter dragged himself up painfully in bed. The pain of the exertion
  turned him sick and faint, but his head was steady now and his brain clear.
  He reached for some cablegram forms and a pencil from the table.</p>

  <p>"The time has come for the coup," he muttered. "It was inevitable from the
  first. The game is going to be a dangerous one, but a little boldness and the
  thing is successfully accomplished. It will be a case of Minter and Kinski
  against the rest. And, if Kinski gets found out, he will have to fly, and I
  shall be able to show a clean pair of hands. What a scheme it is!"</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely Minter wrote out his cypher cable. It was addressed to
  an office in New York. Then he rang the bell and gave the message to a
  groom.</p>

  <p>"You're to go into Reading and dispatch this at once," he commanded. "Here
  are four pounds to pay for it. Take the fastest horse in the stable."</p>

  <p>The groom bowed and retired. They were used to these things at Marvyn
  Chase, so that the cable caused no surprise. Minter was smiling to himself
  now as a man does who has got the best of his foes. He dropped presently into
  a sleep, a sound sleep that he had not had for days. He was still sleeping
  when Lady Mary came in about luncheon time.</p>

  <p>"I'll not disturb him," she said to Maude. "Sleep is the best thing in the
  world for a head like that. How is your patient getting along?"</p>

  <p>The Countess was something of a trial, and Maude was glad when the nurse
  came. It was a lovely afternoon, much too fine to stay indoors. There was not
  the slightest reason why the carriage should not be ordered round and a
  series of visits repaid. It was past three before Lady Mary and Maude
  departed, and nearly four before Minter came out of his sleep at the tinkle
  of the telephone bell.</p>

  <p>"What's up now?" he asked as he grasped the receiver. "Got any more bad
  news, Mellor?"</p>

  <p>"Just the contrary, sir," Mellor said with a catch in his voice. "A
  cablegram from Baron Kinski. He wants to come in at once. His first order is
  for 10,000 shares, and he says he is starting for London on the <i>Cedric</i>
  tomorrow. What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"See our brokers and get the order through at once. Go at once. You need
  not pick up anything for me."</p>

  <p>Minter smiled grimly to himself as he gave these instructions. So far the
  game was perfectly safe. And in any case he could see a good way out for
  himself. The name of Kinski behind himself was good enough for everything. At
  four o'clock Mellor called him up again.</p>

  <p>"I've managed it, sir," he exclaimed. "The market closed firmer than it
  has been for days. There will be a great boom in Certified stock to-morrow,
  especially as Baron Kinski is coming over. Mr. Murdock called a few minutes
  ago, but I was out."</p>

  <p>Minter chuckled. The bait had soon brought the fish.</p>

  <p>"Tell him my head is too bad to do any business," he said. "I'm on no
  account to be disturbed. What's that? Mr. Murdock is there now? I'm sorry,
  but I can't speak to him, I can't really. Ring off."</p>

  <p>Minter banged the receiver down and refused to answer again. Half an hour
  later a telegram came from Murdock&mdash;</p>

  <p class="telegram">"Shall run down and see you by the 8.15. Can explain.
  Shall hold you to your bargain. Mellor seems to have quite misunderstood me
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"So he will come in?" the sick man muttered. "Well, he shall. And shall
  live to rue the day that he tried to play fast and loose with Graham
  Minter."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch49"
     id="ch49"></a>XLIX. THE TURN OF THE WHEEL</h2>

  <p class="first">THE great coup had been made, and there was little to do now
  beyond a waiting game. The sheer audacity of it had frightened Minter at
  first, headstrong and daring as he was. But gradually the details had shaped
  themselves until the thing became perfect. It was only to be played in cases
  of emergency, but the grizzly skeleton had been staring Minter in the face
  for some time now.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he muttered to himself as he lay in bed. "If everything
  goes smoothly I can drop the baron; he can go back to America and stay there.
  If all goes badly, he takes all the blame, and I step discreetly aside and
  efface myself. It's fine! Upon my word, I could almost wish for the worst if
  only to study the faces of certain people, that pompous ass Murdock, for
  instance, who will come in now at any hazards. Well, his name will be
  useful."</p>

  <p>Gradually the racking pain was passing away, the strong, cunning brain
  grew clear, life and freedom were returning to Minter's limbs. He rose
  presently, had his bath, and dressed with more than usual care for dinner. A
  strong cup of tea, and he was himself again. He dispatched a telegram to
  Murdock and sat down now to wait upon events.</p>

  <p>But, first, he must know if that infernal old woman had left the house.
  Things never go exactly as one desires, even in the case of successful
  millionaires, and Minter was displeased to hear that Countess de Lary was
  still at Marvyn Chase. But there was consolation in the fact that she was
  still in bed and likely to remain there.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we must make the best of it," he growled to Lady Mary. "Once
  she does go, she is not to come here again, mind that. And let us have
  something out of the common for dinner, with as much show as you can crowd
  on. I expect Murdock down, and I've asked him to stay the night."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary gave the desired assurance and went away, leaving Minter to his
  music. He was already dressed, though it wanted more than an hour to dinner
  time. He had put business out of his mind altogether; some new music had just
  arrived, and Minter was deep in a study of Schubert's. He looked up, none too
  pleased as somebody touched his shoulder. A drawn, haggard face was looking
  down into his; he hardly recognized Clifford Desborough for the moment.</p>

  <p>"And what the dickens do you want?" he growled. "I was in a world of my
  own for the moment. Has somebody found you out, or what is wrong with the
  man?"</p>

  <p>Desborough crossed over and closed the door carefully. Then he came back
  to Minter's side.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been talking," he said. "Swayne came to me this morning. He
  didn't come from the powers that be, you understand, but he had a mission all
  the same. He hinted that my financial position was freely canvassed; indeed,
  he went further than that. It's pretty clear to me that, unless I can prove
  that my affairs are sound, Hume will get the Secretaryship."</p>

  <p>"What's that got to do with me?" Minter asked brutally.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, if you put it that way. I must convince the public that I am
  largely interested in some sound concern. Somebody must have been talking
  very freely indeed, because I had been almost definitely promised the Home
  Secretaryship."</p>

  <p>Minter saw no difficulty in the way whatever. All Desborough had to do was
  to borrow a good round sum of money from his future wife and invest it in
  sound securities. These he could show to the intermediary Swayne, and there
  would be an end of the matter.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you laughed at the idea of your being in Queer Street?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, I was properly indignant, too. But I can't ask Miss Beaumont
  for that money. We have been brought up in different schools, Minter, and
  regard things with different eyes."</p>

  <p>"Then get the girl to name the day and marry her. A man engaged to a rich
  girl and a man married to her are two different persons. Don't bother me any
  more."</p>

  <p>"Swayne hinted something to the same effect," Desborough said moodily.
  "but that is not quite all. Our side have moved in the matter of the
  Certified Company to restore the case to the paper for next Monday. Carter,
  who is my junior, tells me that fresh evidence had cropped up, and that we
  can manage without Price. I haven't gone into the case yet, but there you
  are. Will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"It won't suit me at all," Minter said between his teeth. "When I got
  Price out of the way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Man alive, you must be mad to talk to me like this!"</p>

  <p>"To the dickens with you and your legal quibbles," Minter cried. "We are a
  pair of rascals together, and there is no use in blinking the fact that we
  both know it. You know that I got Price put away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I may have had my suspicions to that effect, but
  really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suspicions be hanged; you knew it from the first, the same that I know
  that you actually shielded Price in your own chambers when the police were
  after him. Aye, you may stare and wonder where I got that from, but there it
  is. You dared not give Price up, and you know it."</p>

  <p>There was a deep, vexed flush on Desborough's face. He would have given
  his soul at that moment to fling a denial into Minter's face and defy him.
  All he could do was to ask for instructions.</p>

  <p>"Get an adjournment," Minter whispered hoarsely. "We have a week before
  us, and by that time Baron Kinski will be here. Give us another week after
  this, and I am afloat again; between Kinski and Murdock and myself we are
  going to do the trick. Get an adjournment, I say."</p>

  <p>"If the legal firm instructing me objects what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Do? Lots of things. Feign illness, have a kind of seizure in Court. Let
  it be known that nobody can grapple with the case but yourself, and it's
  easily managed. You must do this thing, Desborough, or, by Heaven, I will
  ruin you, stock, lock, and barrel."</p>

  <p>Desborough nodded gloomily. He feared this man; he did not trust him.
  Minter would not hesitate to throw him over at the last moment if his
  interests lay that way. And it was quite possible that the judge trying the
  case of Mackness <i>versus</i> the Certified Company would not consent.</p>

  <p>"Go away," Minter said. "Don't bother me any longer. I want to play this
  music, I want to think. But I am not going to trust you any further than I
  can see you. Only you'd better stop to dinner."</p>

  <p>The big gong boomed out in due course, and the guests began to assemble in
  the drawing-room. Murdock came in rather late, but with an evident desire to
  please his host, who received him curtly. Minter must be very sure of his
  ground to act like that, the shrewd North countryman thought. And all around
  him were evidences of wealth and prosperity, the wonderful pictures, the
  statuary, the floral decorations. Dinner was served presently, and the great
  dining hall, a Jacobean room with some of the finest carved oak and tapestry
  in the kingdom on the walls. The meal was served on a silver service that had
  belonged to Louis XVI, the china was genuine Watteau. It was impossible to
  see the canker in the fruit.</p>

  <p>And yet the ostensible owner was rotten to the core. It only wanted a
  straw upon the wind to start the hurricane to sweep it all away. A few days
  would decide it one way or another. But Minter sat there, strong and
  self-reliant, with the glance of a Napoleon, and a security of his position
  calculated to deceive anybody. Certainly he carried off everything
  exceedingly well. Yet at any moment he would not have been surprised to see a
  figure standing in the doorway with the shadow of Justice behind.</p>

  <p>Desborough watched him bitterly. He had taken Maude into dinner, but he
  was by no means his usual self. Little passed between them, for Desborough's
  mind was busy. He had played it as low down as it was possible to play
  anything; he had made use of a legal secret, but, as yet, he had not dared to
  ask Maude for money. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>He put the thought out of his mind for the moment. He would hear something
  definite presently. Lady Mary and some of her guests were discussing a
  recently-fixed Society wedding. Desborough bent over his plate and said a few
  words, the purport of which Maude failed to catch.</p>

  <p>"Were you asking me something?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Desborough replied. "I am asking you to fix our wedding day. I
  cannot afford to wait any longer. Why not cap Lady Mary's intelligence, and
  say that our wedding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude shuddered. Her face had grown very pale.</p>

  <p>"I must see you presently," she said. "I have a proposal to make to
  you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch50"
     id="ch50"></a>L. BLOOD MONEY</h2>

  <p class="first">DINNER was over at length, and the house party scattered
  about. Kit Clive had come down by a late train, and was in the library
  transacting some business with Minter. He had resigned his position as
  private secretary; in a day or two he would be free of the City for all time.
  Maude was sitting in the outer hall amongst the flowers, with the door open,
  enjoying the evening breeze. There was a trying interview before her, and she
  was trying to brace up her nerves for the ordeal. Kit, passing on his way to
  the stables, found her.</p>

  <p>"This is a bit of bad luck for me," he said cheerfully. "I have a great
  deal to say to you, Maude."</p>

  <p>"Not now," Maude said hastily. "Presently, Kit. I shall be in the small
  dining-room in an hour's time, but first, I have something serious to say to
  Mr. Desborough. Kit, he wants me to fix the day."</p>

  <p>Kit drew a long breath, and his face grew hard.</p>

  <p>"You are not to do that," he said. "On no account let him persuade you to
  do that until you have seen me again. I don't know, I may be wrong, but I
  fancy that I can see the way clear now. I won't give you up, darling; you
  belong to me. I could never be happy without you."</p>

  <p>He caught Maude's hand passionately and carried it to his lips. A shadow
  fell across the hall, and Desborough stood there, with eyes full of cold
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"If I am not intruding," he said. "I should like to have a word with you,
  Maude. In fact, I am under the impression that you asked me here for that
  purpose."</p>

  <p>No colour stained Maude's cheeks; she pointed quite coolly to the chair by
  her side. Kit moved away, and his figure was lost in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"How long is that going on?" Desborough asked.</p>

  <p>"If you have any self-respect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to accept any lessons in self-respect from you," Maude
  said. "I love that man with my whole heart and soul, and he loves me. Do you
  hear that?"</p>

  <p>"I hear it fast enough. But I shall soon teach you to forget it."</p>

  <p>"You never will. Oh, I shall not disgrace you; the tongue of scandal will
  never touch me. And when Society finds that you have not married a rich
  woman, even you will be free from the accusation of a mercenary
  marriage."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that? The fortune that you inherited under the
  will&mdash;but that is nonsense."</p>

  <p>"It is not nonsense at all. I am worth about £20,000 at the outside, and
  that sum is represented by my jewels. Do you know how my money is
  invested?"</p>

  <p>"I never inquired. As your trustees are thorough men of business, I
  presume&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My trustees had no option. When my father died the property of the
  Certified Company was a valuable one. Now, thanks to the manipulations of men
  of the Minter type, it may be worth millions, or it may be worth nothing. All
  my money is invested in Certified Shares."</p>

  <p>Desborough fairly staggered under the blow. Surely Fate had never placed a
  man in such a cruel position. If he won his case, as he most assuredly would
  have done had not Minter got him in his grip, Certified Shares would have
  been worth more than ever. He had quite forgotten for a moment that the late
  Mr. Beaumont had practically been the Certified Company in his lifetime.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me this before?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"For the simple reason that I did not know," Maude replied. "It is only
  quite lately that I have been learning something about business. I had some
  idea of setting my affairs in order, and I wrote to the solicitor to my
  trustees. He tells me that I have everything in that Company."</p>

  <p>Desborough suppressed a groan. He had practically made up his mind to let
  things go, and do as Minter wished. As the husband of Maude he could afford
  to let the world pass, but that did not free him from Minter's hard grip. He
  liked Maude, he wanted a rich wife, but he loved his ambition more than
  either. If he defied Minter, the latter would speak, and he would be ruined.
  Once the bitter truth was spoken, not all the money in the world would ever
  set him on his political pedestal again. And all this time, without knowing
  it, he had been shaping a course deliberately calculated to deprive Maude of
  what he most valued&mdash;her money. And he could see no way out of it.</p>

  <p>If he defied Minter, he would win his case, he would have a rich and
  lovely wife. But then Minter would drive him out of the House of Commons
  without scruple or hesitation. And if he let things go, and Minter came out
  of the trial with flying colours, Maude would be a pauper.</p>

  <p>"You seem to take it very coolly," he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"If you valued your good future&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do. From the bottom of my heart I want Mr. Minter to win. In that
  case you will have no further use of me; you will have degraded yourself in
  my eyes, and played the scoundrel for nothing. Every time you meet me you
  will think that somebody knows you for what you are."</p>

  <p>"If your money is gone"&mdash;Desborough was stung into retort&mdash;"you
  are not likely to meet me in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In Society. You are forgetting. I shall not mind my money, it will not
  make the smallest difference to me. You see I shall be free to marry the man
  I love, and you know he is a rich man. Kit Clive has far more than we shall
  ever need, and he will be glad to take me as I am. On the whole I shall not
  be sorry to see Mr. Minter get the best of that case."</p>

  <p>Desborough made no reply for some little time, and Maude sat there
  regarding him with a smile of dry contempt. Strong, clever man as he was,
  Desborough was hopelessly beaten and overcome. Rack his brains as he might,
  he could see no way out of the difficulty. He was between Minter and the deep
  sea of political oblivion. If Maude's money had been in his hands...Could she
  sell out?</p>

  <p>But Maude could do nothing of the kind, at least not until a certain date.
  Her father had left her everything, with a stipulation that if the shares in
  the company realized a certain price the surplus was to go to her sister,
  Alice, or any representative she left behind her. It sounded sentimental, but
  there it was.</p>

  <p>"But your sister is dead," Desborough said.</p>

  <p>Maude fought her anger down. Was this man utterly shameless?</p>

  <p>"That has to be proved," she said. "It will be a long and expensive
  business, the lawyers tell me. If we win our case those shares will bound up,
  they say, and Alice, if she is alive, would be entitled to something like
  £60,000. I'm told the Court would hesitate to hand that over to me unless my
  proofs of Alice's death were strong."</p>

  <p>As a lawyer, Desborough had to admit the soundness of this reasoning. Both
  Alice Beaumont and her husband might have survived the shipwreck; they might
  be close at hand at the present time. A dull red flushed into the barrister's
  face as he realized how near they were. What his feelings would have been had
  he but known to what extent Maude shared his knowledge can only be
  guessed.</p>

  <p>Maude rose; she felt it impossible to sit there any longer with that
  calculating scoundrel without betraying herself.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to stay here any longer," she said. "It seems to me that I
  have given you plenty of food for reflection. I shall be glad to know in a
  day or two what you propose to do. Or shall we go to Lady Mary and tell her
  the date fixed for our marriage?"</p>

  <p>The bitter gibe went home. Desborough winced before it. Hard rascal as he
  was, he was not quite devoid of feeling. Maude pressed her advantage.</p>

  <p>"I am not without information," she said. "I know, for instance, that Mr.
  Minter is terribly in want of ready money. It seems to be a condition of
  affairs common to the modern millionaire. Let me try and get you out of the
  depths of despair into which you have fallen. I can command money; I can
  raise £20,000 on my jewels. I'll go to Minter and ask him what he will take
  for those papers; I'll offer to buy them. He shall be paid money down. And
  then you will be free to play the man again. No doubt it will be a peculiar
  sensation, but I should say a pleasing one."</p>

  <p>Desborough said nothing, a ray of hope lighted up his dark soul. He made
  some protest, but there was no heartiness or sincerity about it.</p>

  <p>"Minter would not part with the papers," he said feebly. "Besides, I could
  not permit you to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mere hollow words. I can see that you are glad of the suggestion.
  To-morrow night, if I get the chance, I will do this thing for you, for the
  sake of your past, for the sake of the mother who is so proud of you. Try and
  hold up your head once more, look me in the face. For even <i>you</i> are not
  likely to reach a greater depth of degradation than this."</p>

  <p>Maude moved away with her head in the air and the light shining on her
  white, beautiful face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch51"
     id="ch51"></a>LI. MINTER IS CANDID</h2>

  <p class="first">THE special editions of the evening papers arrived at Marvyn
  Chase about ten o'clock. On the whole, Minter had no cause to be
  dissatisfied. Once more he had become a central figure. His portrait, vilely
  executed and smudgily printed, appeared in two of the flimsy sheets, vague
  rumours of the good time coming for Certified shareholders filled columns.
  One contemporary, bolder than the rest, had an interview with Baron Kinski
  telegraphed from New York. On the whole, Mellor had done his work well,
  Minter thought.</p>

  <p>By one bold stroke, his tarnished credit had been established on a higher
  pinnacle than ever! Kinski and Minter and Murdock could move financial
  mountains. At the end of a week Minter could see his way to the best part of
  a million of money. And yet he was at his wits' ends for a few thousand
  pounds in ready cash. It has happened to millionaires before.</p>

  <p>But, on the whole, he had every cause to be satisfied. There were terrible
  dangers ahead, but Minter could make light of them for the present. His smile
  was large and engaging as Maude came up to him as he was leaving the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a little conversation with you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Minter replied. He had a fine admiration for Maude, whose
  beauty and intelligence had made a deep impression on him. If he could have
  looked into the depths of the girl's mind he would have been less florid and
  more cautious. That she was going to make use of him he never imagined for a
  moment. But Maude saw her way clear.</p>

  <p>"Come along to my room," Minter said in great good-humour. "Murdock has
  gone to bed. He is one of the class that takes no liquor, and can't do with
  only eight hours' sleep. Good thing for Murdock that he happened to be the
  son of his father&mdash;he would never have made his own fortune. And now,
  what is it I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>Maude seated herself before the wood fire thoughtfully, for the night had
  turned chilly. The flickering blaze fell on the lovely, sensitive face, on
  the shimmering drapery, and the slender hands. She formed a beautiful picture
  that compelled Minter's admiration.</p>

  <p>"I want some information," she said. "Do you know that all my money is in
  Certified Shares?"</p>

  <p>Minter nodded. There was very little he did not know upon that
  subject.</p>

  <p>"My father practically made that company," she said. "After he died you
  got hold of it; at least, you obtained command of enough shares to direct its
  policy. Then came the business of those smuggled arms. If the case goes for
  Mackness what happens?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you. It's a treat to talk to an intelligent woman like
  yourself. The Mackness action is not a large one, but if it wins it opens the
  door to others. Not that I care so much as I did, because before the week is
  out the shares will be double their present value."</p>

  <p>"And how is that going to be brought about?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you. I'll be perfectly candid. Kinski and Murdock have joined
  in the business. The great public will naturally conclude that we must have a
  good thing, and they'll jump for Certified Shares. They will be up points
  before Wednesday. If you can get your trustees to sell out then, you'll make
  more than £100,000. That's what I'm going to do."</p>

  <p>Maude started at the cool audacity of the speaker.</p>

  <p>"But that sounds like a swindle," she said.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. It's only the smarties who will get bitten. If we win
  our case the enhanced value of Certified Shares will be permanent. At the
  bottom, it is a magnificent property."</p>

  <p>"And if you lose your case, Mr. Minter?"</p>

  <p>"Then there will be a big slump. I shall sell and take my profit, and I
  shall quietly buy back the depreciated shares, because, as I said before, the
  property is a sound one. We shall appeal and fight and argue till the holders
  of shares will be glad to get rid of them."</p>

  <p>"And that is what you call commercial morality?" Maude cried
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>Minter laughed. He had been candid, very candid indeed. He did not usually
  go so far as this with anybody, but he'd had a trying day in which ruin and
  disaster and dishonour had been suddenly turned into smiling prosperity. And
  he had taken a great deal of wine at dinner.</p>

  <p>"It's business," he said. "I've shown you how to make a fortune, and you
  should be grateful. And, unless I am greatly mistaken, you'll take my
  advice."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Maude said, with a curious thrill in her voice. "I shall see that
  my solicitors take your advice. From what you say, you stand on velvet either
  way. But, supposing that the missing witness comes forward and goes into the
  box!"</p>

  <p>Minter's heavy face clouded, and a dark gleam came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My wings would be clipped," he said. "I could do no more than make my
  pile over the shares. If Price gave evidence, I should have to drop
  Certifieds at once. Between ourselves, my dear young lady, Price has a very
  queer story to tell."</p>

  <p>"And so the Certified Company would go into honest ways again, as it did
  in my father's time?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's rather a strong way to put it," Minter said, with a wry
  face, "but it's true. Not that there is the slightest chance of Price turning
  up again."</p>

  <p>Maude bent down and restored a fallen log to the fire. She was fearful
  lest Minter should see the fierce joy blazing on her face. The man had told
  her everything that she positively wanted to know. Better still, he knew
  nothing of the tremendous weapon he was placing in Maude's hands. She would
  free herself yet; she would see the end of Desborough's hated attention, and
  she would lay her head on Kit's breast and be happy.</p>

  <p>"Then I should very much like Price to turn up," she said.</p>

  <p>"Why? You have nothing to gain by it."</p>

  <p>"Personally, perhaps not. But it would cut the knot of the hateful
  business. It would save thousands of poor creatures from ruin in the long
  run. It is men like you who are the bane of modern industry. You cannot do
  anything for yourselves, you invent nothing, you leave nothing better than
  you find it. You have not even the possession of intellect. You are the pests
  of Society."</p>

  <p>Maude flashed out suddenly, not without bitter self-contempt behind her
  anger. It galled her that she had to make more or less of a friend of this
  man. It did not occur to her that he was giving her all this information by
  way of bribing her to keep silence over the visit of Amy Rayne to Marvyn
  Chase. She only knew that she was paltering with a scoundrel for her own
  ends.</p>

  <p>"Are we as bad as all that?" Minter asked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Indeed you are. Your whole stock-in-trade is cunning and audacity. And
  you have no feelings. For your own ends you have gone far to ruin Clifford
  Desborough's career. You are compelling him to do a dishonourable action, the
  trap you deliberately laid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Draw it mild," Minter blustered. "I'm not going to feel any remorse for
  him! There are some men who go through the world honestly, because it has
  never paid them to be otherwise. Some men die honest, because they are never
  tempted. Up to now Desborough has been one of them. But he's bad to the core;
  don't you know that he is as bad as they make 'em?"</p>

  <p>Maude looked down without a reply. She knew perfectly well that he was
  telling the truth. Desborough was bad to the core, but Maude was going to
  make an effort to save him. It would be a costly business, but it would get
  her out of this hateful tangle, and she would have paid a heavy sum for that.
  If Minter refused, her scheme would have to go on.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I should like to see Mr. Desborough free," she said. "If I
  could only handle those papers that you possess he would be free enough."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Minter chuckled as he lighted a cigarette. "Much power
  lies in those slips of paper. Now what price are you prepared to pay for
  them?"</p>

  <p>"In cash," Maude said, very quietly and simply. "I'll give you twenty
  thousand pounds!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch52"
     id="ch52"></a>LII. THE PRICE OF HER FREEDOM</h2>

  <p class="first">MINTER appeared to be looking very thoughtfully into the
  fire. He had himself well in hand to-night, so that it was no trouble to him
  to conceal his feelings. All the same, he was bitterly reviling himself for a
  fool.</p>

  <p>Minter would have given his head at present for the sum Maude had
  mentioned, but there was a very good reason why he could not see his way to
  complete the bargain. Ready-money at the present moment was an absolute
  necessity to him. All his lovely schemes might fail yet for a little golden
  ointment for the machines; given that sum, and he would have backed his
  position against the world. Then, as he sat there, a pretty idea came to him.
  It was utterly unscrupulous, and absolutely worthy of the man, but he decided
  to put it into force.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be strictly between ourselves," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Between you and me, and Mr. Desborough," Maude said. She had certainly
  forgotten Kit for the moment. "Why should I tell anybody else? The only way
  to save Mr. Desborough is by keeping absolute secrecy."</p>

  <p>Minter nodded. Really, when he came to think of it, he did not need those
  fatal bills. He knew now that Price had been deliberately hidden in
  Desborough's chambers; Maude knew the whole guilty secret, and if it became
  necessary to threaten Desborough again it would be easy to call Maude as a
  witness to his guilty knowledge. She would never have backed him up with a
  deliberate lie.</p>

  <p>On the whole, Minter could see his way to play the philanthropist, and put
  money in his pocket at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What do you want those bills for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To burn them. I should burn them as soon as they came into my hands. Oh,
  I don't want to read them&mdash;there is shame and humiliation without
  learning the details by heart."</p>

  <p>Minter rose and paced up and down the room. He could have shouted in his
  exultation. After all, Maude was only a sentimental woman, and she would
  never know anything of business. The money was as good as in his pocket, his
  grip on Desborough would not really be relaxed at all.</p>

  <p>"When do you propose to pay me the money?" Minter asked.</p>

  <p>Maude thought the matter over for a moment. She knew perfectly well that
  the sacrifice entailed the sale of her diamonds, and that might take a day or
  two.</p>

  <p>Doubtless Kit would see to that for her. She had heard Kit talk of a firm
  in Gracechurch Street where they bought gems to any amount, and paid for them
  promptly. The matter might be settled by Wednesday if no hitch took
  place.</p>

  <p>"Shall we say Wednesday evening?" she said. "I could have the papers
  to-night if you would trust me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can trust you fast enough," Minter said with obvious sincerity.
  "There is precious little respect between men where business is concerned,
  but we all admire integrity, much as we sneer at it. I'll go further than
  that; give me your bill for that money at three days' date, and the papers
  are yours now."</p>

  <p>Maude's heart leapt within her. She was actually going to have those
  papers now. Before she slept she would be happy in the knowledge that
  Desborough was free, and that he would not trouble her any more. Again she
  could at once free herself from the slimy tangle of the hateful business.
  Once she was out of it nothing would induce Maude to touch it again.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you want me to do!" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very dreadful," Minter said, with a queer laugh. "I draw out a
  form on stamped paper whereby you agree to pay me £20,000 in three days and
  you sign it. You pay the money into your bank to meet it, and there is an end
  of the matter. It is very simple."</p>

  <p>All this Minter explained quite gleefully. Soon he would be the master of
  a large sum in cash, a sum of money that was of almost a vital necessity to
  him. As a matter of fact, it would be more or less a gift to him, for his
  position and power over Desborough were more secure than ever. Why, this
  transaction in itself was a proof of the things that he knew against
  Desborough.</p>

  <p>"Come into the library," he said. "We'll settle everything in five
  minutes. I've got the forms there, and the papers are in the safe. It is a
  big price you are paying, and Desborough is a lucky man. Now, come along, and
  you can have your bonfire as soon as you like."</p>

  <p>Maude found herself presently affixing her signature to an oblong strip of
  paper. With a sigh of relief that he could hardly conceal, Minter placed the
  document in his safe. Maude watched him with a little smile of contempt
  curling her lip. The thing was blackmail pure and simple, though Minter did
  not seem to see it. To him it was an ordinary business transaction. He
  rummaged about his safe for some time, then he produced a bulky parcel in a
  foolscap envelope.</p>

  <p>"Here you are," he said. "If I were you I should put sentiment aside and
  read those bills. It may not be pleasant literature of the Mudie type, but
  you would at least know that you had value for your money."</p>

  <p>"I shall burn them as they are," Maude said coldly. "Good-night, Mr.
  Minter."</p>

  <p>Minter watched Maude depart with her head in the air. She had paid the
  man's price, and, if possible, she disliked and despised him a little more
  than ever. But that fact did not trouble the burly capitalist in the least.
  He had done an excellent stroke of business. He would restore his battered
  credit now, and pay such things as were a little more than pressing.</p>

  <p>Maude went away with the precious papers clutched tightly in her hand. For
  the loss of her jewels, for the outlay of a sum so enormous, she cared
  nothing. All her trouble and misery had been brought about owing to her
  possession of that wretched money, and Kit had loved her for herself alone.
  Maude's plan was pretty clear, as she went in search of Desborough.</p>

  <p>She found him presently in one of the morning-rooms, a pile of papers
  before him, a half-smoked cigarette between his thin, hard lips. The man was
  far away by this time; he was deeply engrossed in his case. There lay the
  secret of his power. Maude had to speak twice before he looked up.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked. "I am very busy just now. If it is not of
  importance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is of the greatest importance," Maude said. "More important than
  anything you have there. I have been trying to come to terms with Mr.
  Minter."</p>

  <p>"You know perfectly well that he has only one set of conditions?"</p>

  <p>"So he said. But those conditions were rooted in money, and money can do
  anything with a man like that. Suppose I induced him to part with those bills
  for a consideration, what then?"</p>

  <p>Desborough jumped to his feet and commenced to pace up and down the room.
  The grey, tired look left his face, his eyes grew clear and bright. All the
  old ambition was pulsating within him, the darling ambition that had caused
  him to throw honour and conscience to the winds.</p>

  <p>"In that case I should be free," he said. He spoke with his head high, he
  had almost forgotten Maude. "Nothing could touch me any longer, I should get
  back the power and grip that I have lost lately, I should compel my way as I
  have compelled it all along. But Minter would never do that."</p>

  <p>He paused in his walk, his face grew dejected again.</p>

  <p>"Things have altered," Maude said. "Minter seems to think that now he has
  Baron Kinski on his side, to say nothing of Mr. Murdock, he can do great
  things. I offered him a large sum for the papers."</p>

  <p>"And he laughed at you for a fool, I suppose?" Desborough sneered.</p>

  <p>"He did nothing of the kind," Maude said. "He listened. Look here, see
  what I hold in my hand. And without making any condition with you, trusting
  to your manhood and your better sense, I take the poisonous things and throw
  them into the fire there."</p>

  <p>The envelope was dropped into the centre of the wood fire, and the mass at
  once leapt up in blue and yellow flame. Desborough watched in a dazed kind of
  way.</p>

  <p>"I didn't quite understand," he gasped. "You say that Minter agreed
  to&mdash;and he parted with&mdash;impossible! He would never have done it.
  Maude, do you mean to say that the record of my folly, the whole story of my
  past, is burning there before my eyes?"</p>

  <p>"I do mean to say so," Maude cried. "Never mind the power. There is your
  freedom, your <i>freedom</i>. And I am standing here waiting for the one
  thing you can do to atone."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" Desborough asked, with his eyes on the leaping
  flames.</p>

  <p>"Surely you must know," Maude replied. "There is <i>your</i>
  freedom&mdash;now give me <i>mine</i>!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch53"
     id="ch53"></a>LIII. A HARD MASTER</h2>

  <p class="first">DESBOROUGH made no reply, for Maude denied him that
  opportunity. She had done an act of amazing nobility and generosity. Of her
  own free will she had stripped herself of a large portion of her fortune to
  save his name from social and political destruction. Nor could it be urged
  that she had anything to gain by so doing; on the contrary, she had acted
  against her better judgment.</p>

  <p>It was not as if she cared for him, as if she were making a sacrifice for
  the man she loved. Her whole soul turned with disgust and loathing from
  Clifford Desborough, and she would have freed herself from her fetters if she
  could.</p>

  <p>She was going to leave it entirely to Desborough's generosity. She merely
  made the suggestion that one good turn deserves another. Nay, further, Maude
  had not even stayed to receive the thanks of the man she had saved. There
  were the fateful papers now a mere handful of glowing, flickering embers, and
  Desborough was alone with his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Maude had saved him. Juggle with his own conscience as he might, he was
  bound to admit that. From the very first he had known that he must follow the
  crack of Minter's whip, and palter with his honour. He would have sacrificed
  everything to his darling ambition. And now he was once more free.</p>

  <p>He drew a long, deep breath like a swimmer after an extended dive.</p>

  <p>Minter could not touch him now. And those bills had disappeared like a
  millstone from about his neck. He was free in more senses than one. But once
  he took office he would be a poor man, and he knew the value of money. Why
  should Maude want what she called her freedom? His face flushed as he thought
  of it. Why should he let her go? Many other women would have been too ready
  to share lots with him. And, after all, Maude had done no more than she had
  to do. It was specious reasoning, but it seemed to satisfy the ambitious
  barrister in a way.</p>

  <p>He would see Maude to-morrow, and have it out with her. He was going to
  town by an early train, but then Maude was always an early riser. Desborough
  breakfasted alone&mdash;there were breakfasts at all hours at Marvyn
  Chase&mdash;and afterwards asked for Maude. She was in the garden somewhere.
  Desborough looked at his watch, and saw that he had half an hour to
  spare.</p>

  <p>He found Maude presently amongst the roses. She looked fresh and sweet as
  a rose herself; it seemed to Desborough that she had never appeared more
  beautiful. Youth and good looks and riches made up a fine combination. And
  Maude was clever too. With a wife like that there was no reason why
  Desborough should not eventually become Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>Maude laid the fragrant blossoms on a seat as Desborough approached. Her
  heart beat a little faster. She was not in the least afraid of this man; she
  knew now that she could sever the rope when the time came, or, at any rate,
  she fancied that she saw the way, but she preferred that the advance should
  come from Desborough. She hated and despised him from the bottom of her
  heart; yet she would have given much for one disinterested action from
  him.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to speak to me?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a little time to spare. You gave me no chance to thank you
  last night."</p>

  <p>"I wanted no thanks. For your sake, and the sake of the mother who so
  admires you, I made a sacrifice. When you forced me into a hated engagement,
  there was an excuse for you. That excuse is now removed, and you are now a
  free man. God knows, you had fallen low enough in my estimation, but even
  still I hoped for you, I gave you credit for one generous, manly impulse.
  Surely you understand what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Maude held out her hand with Desborough's engagement ring on it. He
  started back, and her face flushed. The time was coming for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I don't quite understand," he said.</p>

  <p>"Surely you do. I want you to take that ring from my finger. Then no
  further word need be said."</p>

  <p>The slender finger shook a little, the stones in the ring glittered in the
  morning light. Desborough pointed to the seat. A little disdainfully, Maude
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"You have set me free," Desborough said. "Now I can look the whole world
  in the face once again. Not only am I beyond Minter's power, but that heavy
  load of debt has gone. And you have done this thing of your own free will. It
  is impossible to thank you."</p>

  <p>"I need no thanks," Maude replied. "All I ask you to do is to take this
  off."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand again, her fingers steadied by now. But Desborough
  ignored the request.</p>

  <p>"So far so good," he said. "I can accept the offer which is certain to be
  made me now; it may lead to the highest post in the power of the Crown. But
  once I abandon my practice I am a poor man. I cannot afford to be a poor man.
  It will make all the difference in the world. But as a rich man, with a
  beautiful and clever wife, I could do anything. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy I do," Maude said with a curl of her lip. "Your wife would be
  part of the programme, a necessary piece of furniture in your political
  doll's house. You would select her as carefully as a builder selects his
  wood. Any such poor adjuncts as love and affection would be out of the
  question. And yet there are women who would not refuse."</p>

  <p>"I don't want them," Desborough said in a low tone. "I only want you,
  Maude."</p>

  <p>"And suppose I found it intolerable, suppose I left you, left you for the
  man I love! Ah, such things happen every day when the woman is bent to the
  breaking point. If you cared for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do care for you, Maude. I love you, and I cannot let you go."</p>

  <p>Maude rose to her feet, the crimson and yellow roses lay on the ground
  unheeded now. Her face was white, her eyes were very scornful.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of love?" she asked. "You profane the name of it. You
  will not let me go because you love me. And yet you would not hesitate a
  moment if you knew that my fortune had dissolved in thin air. There would be
  no struggle."</p>

  <p>"Indeed there would, Maude. I don't think I could let you go in any
  case."</p>

  <p>"That is not true. Let us understand one another. Little as you deserved
  any kindness at my hands, I have done you a great service. I had hoped to-day
  that you had felt the service and tried to repay it. I might have known
  better. I might have known that the scoundrel ready to take disgraceful
  advantage of a family secret would stick at nothing. Oh, have you a single
  good impulse about you, one redeeming virtue? How can I find words to express
  my feelings?"</p>

  <p>"You would have me a fool as well as a knave?" Desborough asked
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"And yet you are both. You are a knave by chance and inclination; a fool
  because you think you can bend a woman to your will. I shall never be your
  wife now. There!"</p>

  <p>Maude wrenched the sparkling circlet from her finger, and threw it
  passionately away. The mere freedom from the presence of the ring seemed to
  give her ease. Without the slightest display of emotion, Desborough picked up
  the trinket and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You will think better of that in your saner moments," he said. "I cannot
  let you go, because I care for you, more than I ever thought to care for
  anybody, besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Besides yourself. You will never love anybody as you do yourself."</p>

  <p>"Possibly not," Desborough said coolly. "But I care very much for you, and
  I shall not let you go. I daresay you imagine that nothing so mean or
  contemptible has ever happened before, but you are mistaken. If you care to
  hold out the olive branch and be friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Friends!" Maude cried, with a dangerous gleam in her eyes. "Oh, yes, we
  shall be friends&mdash;up to a certain point. But I shall have no mercy on
  you now. I almost regret what I did last night. I ought to have let Minter
  degrade you and drag you down. Why don't you leave me? Why do you stand there
  between me and the blessed sunshine?"</p>

  <p>Desborough walked slowly away. He had said his will, and gained his point
  as he thought. Really he had gone far to meet his own absolute
  degradation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch54"
     id="ch54"></a>LIV. THE COUNTESS SPEAKS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was some time before Maude could think of her flowers
  again; they lay on the grass at her feet neglected and forgotten. Maude had
  half expected something like this, but the truth was humiliating. She felt
  utterly sick and weary of the world, and inclined to trust nobody in it. But
  gradually it all came back to her, the faith, the hope, and the beauty of the
  day. She picked up the roses and buried her hot face in them.</p>

  <p>"We'll play our trump card," she whispered, as if telling her secret to
  the flowers. "And if the rogue in the play does what one has every right to
  expect, I shall be free, free. And once I am free there is to be no mercy for
  Mr. Clifford Desborough. He shall never be Home Secretary, never. Fancy a
  wretch like that having the power of life or death over poor creatures who
  are clean by comparison. He shall be punished, and I am the chosen
  instrument."</p>

  <p>Maude walked thoughtfully back to the house. Most of the men had departed
  for town, including Minter. He was in an expansive, generous mood; he had a
  good thing which he did not mind sharing. His advice to all his rich guests
  was to buy Certified Shares. They could use their discretion about selling,
  but there were small fortunes to be made in the next few days. All this was
  very broad and good-natured on Minter's part, and he was voted a good fellow.
  It never seemed to occur to them that they were pawns in Minter's game. So
  most of them had gone to town eager to make money.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go, too," Maude smiled. "You see, I am also interested in
  the stock. How one picks up the jargon of the Exchange here. I must go and
  see my trustees, May. And, at the same time, I am going to take our friend
  the Countess along."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary agreed. Minter had mentioned the old lady again that morning.
  Lady Mary was kind-hearted enough, but she was terribly afraid of her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with her?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Take her home with me for the present. I have written to my mother to
  meet me this morning at Paddington. I daresay we shall manage to make the
  poor old thing comfortable."</p>

  <p>So Maude departed at length, taking the Countess along. Mrs. Beaumont was
  waiting at Paddington; the Countess seemed to take to her at once. The whole
  thing sounded quixotic to a degree, but there was a great deal here beyond
  mere good nature. Countess de Lary was going to be a valuable ally later
  on.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not coming with you," Maude said. "I am going into the City,
  where I have an appointment with one of my trustees, Mr. Shackleton. I shall
  be back late in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>Maude took a taxi and proceeded to Fenchurch Street. She had hitherto
  hated the City and its ways, but now she was interested as Minter himself. In
  the private office of Mr. Shackleton she waited, idly turning over the pages
  of the early edition of the evening papers. She looked with some curiosity to
  the City news. She read the headlines&mdash;"Foreign Rails Dull," "Strong
  Market in 'Certifieds'"&mdash;with a peculiar thrill. There was a good deal
  she could not understand, but she could make out that in some way Minter and
  Murdock and Kinski were sending up the stock she was so greatly interested
  in.</p>

  <p>And behind all this the drama of love and plot and passion were being
  played. Business men glanced at the slim figure there, and wondered what so
  much loveliness was doing there. Maude found herself presently in the
  presence of her trustee. He was very busy, he said, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I understand," Maude smiled. "But you are going to give me all your time.
  Mr. Shackleton, I want you to sell all my shares in the Certified
  Company."</p>

  <p>The man of business smiled. But he listened with his deepest attention as
  Maude proceeded with her story.</p>

  <p>"And that is all I have to tell," she concluded. "You are the one friend
  of the family who knows the tragedy of my poor sister Alice's life. I want to
  stop that tragedy, and give her the right to hold up her head again and
  appear before the world. Day and night I have been thinking this out, and now
  Fate has shown me a way. Is my scheme wild and impracticable?"</p>

  <p>"It's splendid!" Shackleton cried. "Really splendid! And it looks all so
  dry and legal, too. If the shares go up another two points, as they are
  certain to do, I shall sell. Then there will be a surplus of £50,000 odd for
  your sister Alice. Immediately we shall go to the Court for instructions as
  to what is to be done with the sum pending proof of your sister's death."</p>

  <p>"But there will be no hint as to her story?" Maude asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No occasion for that, my dear Maude. The case will be reported in the
  papers; it will look so commonplace and natural that it is bound to have the
  effect you desire. Really, you should come in with us, a head like yours is
  wasted on mere Society. But I am heartily glad for poor Alice's sake. Only
  you had better leave her where she is for the present."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Maude sighed. "Any move on my part might be fatal. Of course,
  the man Price had not the slightest idea I am aware that Alice is alive. And
  now I fancy that I can safely leave matters to you. If you only knew how I
  loathe the City."</p>

  <p>Mr. Shackleton laughed as he shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Let me whisper a word in your ear," he said. "Strictly between ourselves,
  we all hate it. I never knew a man who really didn't in his heart. I'll let
  you know as soon as the sale is effected, and the next day we will apply to a
  judge to know what to do with Alice's share. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>Maude felt easier and happier in her mind than she had done for some time.
  She had been just a little afraid that Mr. Shackleton would deem her scheme
  wild and impossible. Given one little thing, and she would be absolutely
  free, and Alice would be free also.</p>

  <p>"Well, I declare, I haven't seen you looking so bright for a long time,"
  Mrs. Beaumont said as Maude came in smiling to tea. "What have you been
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"Making money," Maude said gaily. "A wonderful place is the City."</p>

  <p>Countess de Lary sat up, and her eyes sparkled. The mere mention of money
  aroused her. The gambling spirit in her was not dead, it was doubtful if it
  ever would be.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it, my dear," she asked. "That is the talk that does me
  good. It warms my blood and makes me feel young again."</p>

  <p>Maude would willingly have passed on to another topic, but the Countess
  prattled on. Baron Kinski was at the bottom of all her rambling discourse.
  Some day or another she would be even with him, and then she would come into
  the fortune of which he had deprived her. Mrs. Beaumont slipped from the
  room, leaving Maude to bear the brunt of the conversation alone.</p>

  <p>"Well, you might see your Baron presently," she said. "He is coming to
  England, you know; in fact, he has already sailed for Europe. I read it
  to-day in one of the papers."</p>

  <p>The Countess chuckled, her eyes had grown very bright and cunning.</p>

  <p>"I saw it too," she said. "It is all nonsense; what you call hanky-panky.
  They say that man is coming, that he was interviewed before he started. And,
  behold, I know better, because at this very moment he is in England. They say
  he is coming to a great house in Park Lane. Why does he not come when all the
  time he is in England?"</p>

  <p>"But surely," Maude protested, "surely there must be a mistake on the
  part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of those imaginative pressmen, my dear. I tell you that man is in
  England. I forfeit my precious jewels if such is not the case. Some of these
  early days I will point him out to you with his glossy hair and beautiful
  black beard. A black beard! Oh, oh!"</p>

  <p>The speaker laughed as if something heartily amused her.</p>

  <p>"Is the man an impostor?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a great impostor. Baron Kinski, with his black beard. He is no baron
  at all, but an English adventurer who is wanted on the Continent. When I knew
  him first&mdash;but that is what your great novelists call another story. Ah,
  if you could only see us meet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What would happen then?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"I would pull his beard off," the Countess said. "But no occasion to do
  that. When he comes face to face with me I get all that he robbed me of,
  everything&mdash;perhaps more. Ah, and I have never noticed that piano. Will
  you play me something?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch55"
     id="ch55"></a>LV. FOR HER OWN SAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">GRADUALLY, but surely, Maude was beginning to see her way
  now. One false step, however, might ruin everything. So long as Price kept
  away from Alice, so long as he was utterly unsuspicious that Maude knew of
  her sister's existence, all was well. All the same, Maude's conscience
  pricked her over Alice. The girl had been terribly neglected.</p>

  <p>Maude dared not write or communicate direct, which would have spoilt
  everything; but, at any rate, she would send for Harvey Denton. By the aid of
  the telephone she got him presently, and in the course of the evening Denton
  came round.</p>

  <p>He had not seen Alice for some days, he admitted. Now that Price was back
  again the thing was more difficult. He had been frequently in the
  neighbourhood of Paradise Buildings, but he had seen nobody about there whom
  he could identify with Alice.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that," Maude said, with a sigh of relief. "At any rate,
  that scoundrel has not been inflicting his presence on my poor sister. Not
  that she is likely to be poor or afflicted much longer. Of course, you know
  that Price is Alice's husband?"</p>

  <p>"I do. Alice told me so. I have believed her from the first."</p>

  <p>"And you have always cared for her, Harvey?"</p>

  <p>"Always, always. You know that. But she laughed at me, and then Price came
  with his, strange fascination, and the mischief was done. And yet all the
  time Alice cared for me; she told me so. I shall never care for another
  woman. It is very sad."</p>

  <p>"Sad indeed," Maude said gently. "Some day we may find a way out. For the
  present I want to see Alice free of that scoundrel, free to hold up her head
  and to come home. If she could only prove her marriage she could come home
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. But Price is too cunning a scoundrel for that. He married Alice
  for the money he thought she had, and he was disappointed. That marriage took
  place secretly in a church that Alice cannot identify. She says that she was
  dazed and confused, and that she had travelled far. That was the cunning of
  the man. If anything went wrong he could deny the marriage, thus leaving him
  entirely free. Things did go wrong, and Price denied the marriage. But that
  there was a marriage I am certain."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we could not advertise for the certificate?" Maude suggested
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"My dear Maude, what do you suppose I have been doing all this time? I
  have tried every means I can think of. Price is not the man to stick at
  trifles. He is quite capable of stealing a register or burning a vestry down.
  Oh, he is a cunning rascal."</p>

  <p>"He will find that I am as cunning," Maude smiled. "I have laid a trap for
  Price, and I am sure that he will walk into it. Meanwhile I want you to try
  and see Alice, and let her know that she is not forgotten. In a day or two
  she can return home, tell her that. How I am going to bring it all about must
  be my secret for the present. You need not be afraid of meeting Price; he has
  a great deal to occupy his attention just at present."</p>

  <p>"I'll go to-night," Denton said, taking up his hat eagerly. "If Alice
  wants to see you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If she wants to see me badly bring her into the garden. Then you can come
  round to the front door and tell me what you have done. But Alice is best
  where she is for the present."</p>

  <p>Denton departed on his errand. There was nothing for it but to go boldly
  into Alice's room and take the chance of meeting Price there. He knocked
  somewhat timidly on the door, and a feeble voice bade him enter. Alice was
  seated by the fire with a wrap about her shoulders. She looked terribly drawn
  and ill; there were great lines under her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have not been yourself, my darling," Denton said tenderly.</p>

  <p>"I have been ill," Alice said! "but for the kindness of some people
  here...Oh, yes, I had money; I got that from Maude. For a day or two I
  thought I was going to die. Oh, if you only knew how utterly lonely it has
  been."</p>

  <p>Alice's voice broke, and the tears streamed down her cheeks. Denton bent
  down, and put his arm round her; the girl's arm closed about his neck. For a
  long time they were silent.</p>

  <p>"The tears have done me good," Alice whispered. "They have taken the hard
  lump from my heart. I was very nearly sending for you to take me away; I very
  nearly gave up everything for you. But I am better now. I shall be able to
  stand it. But I was so dreadfully lonely."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid to come," Denton said. "If that man had seen me
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are quite right. Only it seemed so very, very lonely. And I
  prayed God to let me die and end it. Have you seen Maude lately?"</p>

  <p>Alice looked up and spoke more cheerfully, though obviously with an
  effort.</p>

  <p>"I have just left her," Denton explained. "She asked me to call here.
  Maude is a very clever girl, and she has some great scheme on hand. She is
  quite certain that within the next few days you will be able to return home
  and hold up your head before the world again."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear old Harvey, I could never do that unless I could prove my
  marriage. And that will never be so long as it suits my husband's purpose to
  disguise the truth.</p>

  <p>"Maude knows that quite well. And she is going to make Price speak. Do you
  feel well enough for a walk with me as far as Royal Crescent, or we could
  have a cab, as far as that goes? Maude says she should like to have a little
  chat with you."</p>

  <p>Alice rose unsteadily. She was weaker than Denton had imagined. He saw
  that her hands shook as she put on her hat and gloves, such patched, worn
  gloves they were.</p>

  <p>"It will be a change," Alice murmured. "It will take me out of myself. If
  I were ill here long I should slowly go mad. Did ever a girl suffer more
  cruelly for a foolish mistake?"</p>

  <p>Alice seemed a little braver and stronger in the open air, but Denton
  would not let her walk. A little while later and she was in the familiar
  garden of Royal Crescent. She recalled the night that Gambit had effected her
  miserable capture; she had entered the house by that window. The touch of a
  hand on her shoulder brought her back with a start from the past to the
  present. Maude was smiling tenderly into her face.</p>

  <p>"I had not forgotten you, dear," she said, "only I have been so very, very
  busy. Why do you start so? That is only Harvey Denton smoking his cigarette
  while he waits for you. My dear Alice, I wish I could take you into the house
  now and keep you there always."</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven you could," Alice whispered fervently. "The life I have
  been leading lately, the dreadful solitude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know it must be dreadful. I do feel for you, indeed, dearest
  sister. And yet it is necessary that you should go on for a few days longer.
  It will be only this week. Keep on telling yourself that by Sunday you will
  be under the old familiar roof again, never to leave it except from your own
  choice. I pledge you my word that by Sunday you will be free."</p>

  <p>Maude spoke low and fervently, but there was conviction in every word.
  Alice felt her heart uplifted and comforted.</p>

  <p>"You don't know how ill I have been," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I do, dearest. I can tell that by your voice. I don't want to
  look into your face, for then I might break down altogether and drag you into
  the house and ruin everything. No, I am not going to tell you or anybody else
  my scheme. By to-morrow night I shall know if all is well. Oh, Alice, pray,
  pray that it may come out all right."</p>

  <p>"My heart is constantly praying," Alice said. "Looking back my past is
  like some hideous dream. Oh, I have had my punishment for my deception. I'll
  go away now, Maude; I'll live in hopes. And I wanted those hopes badly when
  Harvey Denton came to me to-night."</p>

  <p>Maude kissed her sister tenderly and wiped the tears from her own eyes.
  She could be hard and cold when she liked, but she was a very woman after
  all. Even now it was a big struggle to put Alice aside, to send her home to
  her hovel, when she might have stayed here.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," Alice said. "Is that my mother's shadow on the blind? What will
  she say, Maude? Oh, to see her again! And yet the very thought frightens me.
  Let me go home now. I feel that I shall sleep to-night, and Heaven knows that
  I need it."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch56"
     id="ch56"></a>LVI. KIT CAUSES A SURPRISE</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE slept herself in a fashion, but her brain was too
  excited for much rest. Everything vital to her scheme depended upon the next
  day. By the afternoon she hoped to hear that Mr. Shackleton had sold the
  Certified shares at a handsome profit, and then the trap would be properly
  baited. For the second time in her life Maude turned to the City columns of
  the daily paper. She read down the article without understanding much about
  it, but she saw enough to satisfy herself that all was going well.</p>

  <p>The upward tendency of the shares was still maintained. They had closed
  strong, with every symptom of rising still higher. But the best laid schemes
  of mice and men gang oft agley, and Maude would not feel fully satisfied
  until she had heard from Mr. Shackleton that the sale had been actually
  made.</p>

  <p>She would go into the City after luncheon and see for herself. Meanwhile
  she had the Countess off her hands for the present. The old lady was still
  suffering from the effects of the chill, which the short journey by train had
  not improved. She seemed saner and calmer this morning, and wisely decided to
  stay in bed for the day, a decision that Maude applauded for more reasons
  than one.</p>

  <p>Maude stood on the step undecided whether to walk part of the way this
  glorious afternoon and take a taxi when Lady Mary's carriage fluttered past.
  There was a motion of the hand, and the Victoria pulled up.</p>

  <p>"You look undecided," Lady Mary said. "Come with me. I need money, and I
  am going to beard the lion in the City. What do you say to being my
  support?"</p>

  <p>Maude replied that she also was going into the City on money business.
  They came at length to the huge suite of offices where Minter transacted his
  business. There scores of clerks bent over huge ledgers, a constant stream of
  people came and went. In his private office Minter sat. He smiled as his
  visitors entered and curtly offered them five minutes of his time. He
  scribbled a cheque and tossed it over to Lady Mary with an air of great good
  humour.</p>

  <p>"There," he said. "I make it and you spend it. Miss Beaumont, I see you
  have taken my advice."</p>

  <p>"And what might that be?" Maude asked innocently enough.</p>

  <p>"Why, over the Certified shares. You can't keep knowledge of that kind
  from us. A big block of shares were thrown into the market this morning by
  Shackleton &amp; Co., and they were snapped up directly. I should say you are
  £50,000 better off than you were a couple of hours or so ago."</p>

  <p>Maude smilingly replied that she was very glad to hear it. The news took a
  heavy weight off her shoulders. In all human probability her scheme would be
  successful now. Minter looked across the table and winked.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget your little obligation to me," he said in a hoarse
  whisper.</p>

  <p>Maude started. She had forgotten all about it for a few moments. And the
  money had to be paid to-morrow. She got Lady Mary to put her down outside the
  offices of Shackleton &amp; Co., and urged her friend not to wait.</p>

  <p>"Goodness knows how long I shall be here," she said. "There may be papers
  to sign and all that kind of thing, Go back to the West, giddy butterfly, and
  spend your money."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary kissed her hand gaily and vanished. Mr. Shackleton had just come
  in and would see Maude at once. He smiled as he shook hands and pointed to a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have come into the business," he said. "We have followed
  your suggestion, and the result is that you have materially increased your
  fortune. To say nothing of your own profit, there is a surplus of over
  £50,000 that belongs to your sister Alice."</p>

  <p>"I am heartily glad of it for her own sake," Maude said, "to say nothing
  of other things. And I was terribly afraid that something might happen at the
  last moment to upset all my plans. Now how long before you can ask the Court
  to advise us what to do with this money?"</p>

  <p>Shackleton smiled shrewdly at the question.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he said, "we could do it to-morrow. You see it is not
  business of a contentious nature."</p>

  <p>"It would be reported in the papers, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Is there anything else I can tell you?"</p>

  <p>Maude thought not. She was more than satisfied with her day's work.
  Everything was going on in the most successful fashion. All she had to do now
  was to raise the money for Minter by the sale of her jewels. True she might
  have had the wherewithal from Mr. Shackleton, but that would have entailed a
  certain amount of explanation, and she could not go into sentiment with her
  man of business.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall say good-bye," she cried smilingly. "I think we have done
  very well. And it is so nice to think that Alice will have an independent
  fortune of her own."</p>

  <p>Maude retraced her steps, a conspicuous figure in the crowd of bustling
  men, to Minter's office, where she asked to see Mr. Clive. He came at once
  with a smile to meet her.</p>

  <p>"My last day or two here," he said. "After that I shall bid a long
  farewell to the City. But what brings you in this line of industry?"</p>

  <p>Maude partly explained. She wanted to consult Clive on important business.
  Was there no place near where it was possible for a lady to have a cup of
  tea? Clive thought that it could be managed. There was a little place where
  they sold tea, and which was fairly quiet at this hour.</p>

  <p>"Now I am going to tell you something," Maude said, as she sipped her tea.
  "I want £20,000. You may naturally suggest my trustees, but there are reasons
  why they should know nothing about it. Isn't there a place here where they
  advance large sums on jewellery?"</p>

  <p>Kit thought a moment before replying.</p>

  <p>"Won't you let me be your banker?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I won't," Maude said firmly. "I want you to take me to those
  people to-morrow and get the matter settled. It was you who told me about
  them in the first place."</p>

  <p>"Greyson &amp; Co., of Gracechurch Street," Kit said. "Very well. Meet me
  to-morrow at the same time, and we'll settle the affair out of hand. You
  haven't been gambling, have you?"</p>

  <p>Maude laughed just a little unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I have in a fashion," she said. "I laid £20,000 on a man's integrity, and
  I lost. It was a bad bet, but, at the same time, I thought my horse was not
  quite the rogue he proved to be."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you want this money to help Desborough?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it, Kit. You remember telling me some time ago that
  though they looked so wonderfully prosperous at Marvyn Chase Mr Minter was
  desperately driven for ready money? You know also the power he had over
  Clifford Desborough? Well, it came to me that I might buy Mr. Minter off. So
  I went to him and offered him £20,000 for those bills. That is why I want to
  raise money On my diamonds."</p>

  <p>"So you got those bills?" Kit said. He was breathing a little faster than
  usual. "What did you do with them?"</p>

  <p>"I burnt them in the presence of Clifford Desborough. I put them into the
  heart of the fire."</p>

  <p>"You looked through them very carefully first, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Kit, I didn't do anything of the kind. I know enough to the
  detriment of Clifford Desborough already. Why should I pry further into his
  disgraceful past? Mr. Minter said I ought to satisfy myself that I had
  obtained what I had paid for, but I refused. Anyway they are burnt now."</p>

  <p>"And so you burnt them in Desborough's presence. What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"At first he was too surprised to speak. I told him I had given him his
  freedom, and I asked for mine. Then I left him to think it over. And, after
  all I had done, he refused to let me go. He said he loved me&mdash;a mere
  pollution of the word&mdash;he said he wanted a rich wife. I have destroyed
  his secret, but he refuses to destroy mine. Kit, was there ever such a
  scoundrel?"</p>

  <p>Kit did not speak for a moment. His eyes were blazing, but all the time
  there was a queer little smile hovering about the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"A scoundrel indeed," he said. "So now that he is free he is going to hold
  you still to your bargain? He little knows that you burnt merely a heap of
  paper refuse."</p>

  <p>"My dear Kit, those bills were destroyed under my own eyes."</p>

  <p>"Indeed they were not," Kit said coolly. "As a matter of fact, I purchased
  the real securities from Minter myself a week ago, and, what is more, I have
  them in my breast pocket at this very moment. Will you take my word for it,
  or shall I prove what I say?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch57"
     id="ch57"></a>LVII. PAVING THE WAY</h2>

  <p class="first">MAUDE failed to understand for a moment the drift of Kit's
  statement. There was something very stern about his face, though his lips
  suggested a faint amusement.</p>

  <p>"But I don't know what you mean," the girl said. "Mr. Minter handed me
  those papers himself. He even pressed me to examine them, so that I might see
  that I had full value for my money."</p>

  <p>"He is an audacious man," Kit replied. "He trusted to the certainty that
  you would not understand even if you had read them. But they are in my
  pocket. I bought them, and paid for them. And I can assure you that I
  verified the signature on every document."</p>

  <p>"But what did you want them for, Kit?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Minter had no further use for them. He seemed to think
  that he had said and shown enough to prove that he had Desborough under his
  thumb. I happened to know, too, that he was in desperate need of ready-money,
  and I offered him as much for those bills as they cost him. Doubtless he
  imagined that I had some rascally game on&mdash;Minter believes in no man's
  honesty&mdash;and he parted with a grin. Oh, I assure you that I am quite
  correct."</p>

  <p>Maude no longer doubted it. Minter had played a double game, probably
  driven by the pressing need for more ready-money.</p>

  <p>"It is a criminal thing," Maude said. "What shall I do, Kit?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. If Minter presses you tell him that you have been deceived.
  Refer him to me."</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to do under the circumstances. Maude looked
  thoughtfully at her lover.</p>

  <p>"There is another thing that I should like to know," she said. "Why did
  you buy those papers?"</p>

  <p>"I bought them to save you, Maude. My darling, do you suppose I could sit
  quietly down and see you marry that scoundrel? How utter a blackguard he is,
  is proved by the fact that he refuses to release you after you have
  apparently saved him. Could you marry him?"</p>

  <p>Maude shuddered. She had always felt that her conscience would fail her at
  the critical moment.</p>

  <p>"I see," Kit went on gravely. "I don't want to pry into your secrets, but
  I never had the smallest intention of letting you go. And now I am master of
  the situation. If Desborough refuses to release you, I shall have a complete
  list of the bills and documents in my possession printed in the paper in
  Desborough's constituency that support the opposite side in politics. The
  Editor would jump at a chance like that. I can ruin Desborough, both
  politically and financially, and I'll do it unless he ceases his
  persecution."</p>

  <p>Kit's voice was hard, but deadly earnest. There was a suggestion of power
  and resolution about him that Maude had never noticed before. It was good to
  know that she could rely upon a man like this.</p>

  <p>"Don't do anything rash," she urged. "Badly as that man has treated me, I
  don't desire to ruin him. If he will only act honourably I will ask no more.
  And in a day or two I shall be able to tell you my secret, Kit; then it will
  be a secret no longer. I am even hoping that there will be no disgrace. And
  if I am right, Mr. Desborough will be harmless in any case."</p>

  <p>Kit opened his mouth to reply, and then suddenly changed his mind. It was
  very sweet and charming of Maude to speak like this, but the easier she took
  it the harder Kit grew. But for the accident of fortune, Maude would have
  been forced into a hateful match by a callous scoundrel. When the time came
  Kit had no intention for him to escape scot free. Desborough should pay the
  price of his perfidy. A man like that had no business in the House of
  Commons.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," he said. "Meanwhile, you keep those diamonds. Go home now
  and forget all about it. And if Minter makes himself objectionable refer him
  to me. Shall I call you a cab?"</p>

  <p>Maude was glad enough to get away from the City to the more congenial
  atmosphere of the West End. She was only too anxious to see the next day
  over. She came down next morning with a feverish anxiety to see the day's
  papers. Perhaps the application suggested by Mr. Shackleton had not been
  deemed of sufficient public interest to secure a place in their columns.</p>

  <p>But, to Maude's great relief, it was all there. The <i>Times</i> gave it
  in full, the other papers less extensively. The cheaper Press made a kind of
  story out of it, the story of a dead girl's fortune, and gave it special
  headlines. It read almost like a romance under the practised hand of the
  up-to-date journalist.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how that can be missed," Maude told herself. "Everybody must
  see it. But I'll make sure, I'll ask Price to come and see me to-night."</p>

  <p>She hastily scribbled off a note and posted it herself. Maude had
  cancelled all her social engagements for the next day or two; she did not
  feel equal to the strain. A quiet afternoon with a book and an equally quiet
  early dinner restored her ruffled nerves somewhat. At the same time, quite
  late in the evening, she was not pleased to hear that Desborough was waiting
  for her in the front drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me?" Maude asked. It was getting late, she wanted
  the house quiet, and the servants out of the way before Price came. "Why do
  you come at this time?"</p>

  <p>"Am I so very late?" Desborough asked. "Usually this is about the hour you
  generally start out when you are dining at home. But I will not detain you. I
  have, as yet, had no answer to my question. I am a busy man, and I won't
  unduly bore you with my company. I won't stay many minutes now. What do you
  think of this?"</p>

  <p>Desborough produced half a sheet of notepaper from his pocket and handed
  it to Maude. It was a brief announcement of the fact that the wedding of Miss
  Maude Beaumont and Mr. Clifford Desborough, K.C., would take place at a
  certain church at a certain date. The girl read it with a curling lip.</p>

  <p>"Well," Desborough asked impatiently, "what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>"Concise and to the point," Maude said. "I presume this is intended for
  publication. Well, I shall not stop you. It is all the same to me. Send it to
  the <i>Morning Post</i> if you like. But I shall never marry you. You have
  treated me shamefully. I wonder how you dare to come into my presence at all.
  And you are going to be punished, ah, you are going to be punished. I have
  given you every chance, and you refuse to take warning."</p>

  <p>Desborough smiled, but in a vaguely uneasy way.</p>

  <p>"Do you fully understand what you are talking about?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only too well," Maude cried. "Give me my freedom and I will try to show
  you a little clemency. Oh, this is no wild theatrical talk of mine. You
  deserve all the punishment that you will get; never has a man played so vile
  a game as yours before. And it is not yet too late to save yourself."</p>

  <p>Desborough buttoned up his coat carefully and reached for his hat. He did
  not understand, he had no particle of imagination. How could anybody injure
  him so long as those fateful bills were destroyed? He was free as air now to
  act in any way he chose. He only wished that he could lay his hands on Eli
  Price, and hand him over to justice. Then he could smash Minter, and his
  triumph would be complete. So men often argue when the strong hand of
  destruction is grasping for them. He had no fear of Price, though he had
  shielded him once. Price would never have an opportunity of telling that
  tale.</p>

  <p>"You are hysterical this evening," he said. "You don't know what you are
  saying. I am going back to my chambers when I shall make a copy of the
  paragraph I have just shown you for all the leading papers. Tomorrow you will
  be able to read it for yourself in print."</p>

  <p>"As you wish," Maude said wearily. "By the end of the week I shall be free
  from you. Oh, I am not going to tell you any more; it will be no use you
  coming to me afterwards to intercede for you. You are a strong, cunning man,
  but you are not the first man of that class who has been outwitted by a
  woman."</p>

  <p>Maude turned and rang the bell as a sign that the interview was ended. In
  spite of his smile, Desborough was feeling mean and small. Maude was
  boasting, of course, she really could do nothing. Desborough went
  thoughtfully down the steps and crossed the road. A figure seemed to be
  skulking there as if waiting for some signal. The figure looked up, and
  Desborough recognized him.</p>

  <p>Eli Price in the flesh! Surely his good angel was on his side to-night.
  Above all people this was the one that Desborough most wanted to meet. Once
  get the missing witness in the box, and Minter was doomed. He paused in front
  of the slouching figure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch58"
     id="ch58"></a>LVIII. ELI PRICE GOES HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">THE recognition was mutual. Price remembered that hard, cold
  face well enough. This was the man who had given him shelter in the time of
  his need, but by no means out of kindness of heart. Price could read faces,
  and he could read Desborough's on that eventful night. He read it now under
  the flare of the gas lamp, and he saw quite plainly that he was going to be
  handed over to the police.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute," he said softly. "There is a policeman coming. No, not
  that way, just behind you."</p>

  <p>Desborough turned slightly. A policeman was exactly what he was looking
  for. He had his story all ready. Like a flash, Price had his man by the
  throat, and was hammering his head against the square railings before he
  could give a cry. But the policeman was not so apocryphal as Price had
  imagined, for he suddenly loomed into the light, and Price sprang for the
  railings as active as a cat.</p>

  <p>"I should have murdered the brute in another minute," he said
  breathlessly, as he darted across the grass. "Oh, blow your whistle, you
  beauty, and may it stick into your throat and choke you."</p>

  <p>Price was over the railings on the far side and sprinting down Carrington
  Place before Desborough recovered his scattered senses.</p>

  <p>Not till Price found himself out of Oxford Street did he breathe freely.
  He had walked boldly enough past a great many policemen lately, but he felt
  very shy of them to-night. He drew a long breath when at length Paradise
  Buildings came in sight, and he was in the shelter of the hall.</p>

  <p>He crept upstairs to Alice's room and knocked at the door. There was no
  answer as he walked in. The lamp was on the table, the typewriter open by its
  side, a heap of paper littered about. On a chair stood the remains of a
  rather elaborate supper.</p>

  <p>"Gone out to post some work," Price muttered. "Um, the remains of a pretty
  supper, and a lot of flowers about that evidently cost money. I wonder what
  it means? Had a bit of luck perhaps. Taken in the <i>Morning Post,</i> too.
  What <i>does</i> it mean?"</p>

  <p>Alice came in presently, tired and breathless. Her features changed, and
  she fell back with dismay at the sight of the man who meant so much misery to
  her.</p>

  <p>"You back again?" she faltered. "I&mdash;I did not expect&mdash;this. You
  told me that you should never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and stopped, for the ready tears choked her. How foolish she
  had been to imagine that this man would ever cease to persecute and annoy
  her!</p>

  <p>"Don't unman me with the warmth of your reception," Price said fiercely.
  "What a pitiful white-faced cat it is! And to think that I should once call
  you good looking! I didn't come here by my own choice. I met a man to-night
  who recognized me, and who meant to hand me over to the police. I wish I had
  killed him!"</p>

  <p>Alice sat on a chair shivering and trembling, Price puffed savagely at a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have killed him," he said. "And who do you suppose he was? But
  you'll never guess. It was Mr. Clifford Desborough, the lawyer. Once he
  shielded me, for his own good purpose, now he wants me in the dock. I read it
  in that hard, cruel face of his as soon as I saw his eyes...Then a policeman
  came round the corner and that saved him."</p>

  <p>He ground his teeth together and paced the room furiously. Alice could
  only cower there and cry quietly. An hour before she had been brave and
  strong enough, happy in the knowledge that Maude was moving in her interests,
  but with Price before her the future looked black and hopeless.</p>

  <p>"This is a pretty welcome for a man," Price growled. "And only for a day
  or two that I am here. It isn't so attractive as I thought. You go off to
  bed. I may be here when you get up in the morning, or I may be gone. You can
  bolt your door if you are afraid of me."</p>

  <p>Price was alone at last, and not sorry to be deprived of Alice's society.
  He had never cared for the woman on whom he had wasted his valuable person,
  and all along she had been a terrible drag to him. He began to wish that he
  had not come here at all, no doubt his old haunt was perfectly safe if he had
  only kept his nerve. Anyway he would hear from Macgregor in the morning, and
  then he would know for certain.</p>

  <p>He would stay here the night anyway, only a little brandy was a necessity.
  He walked out into the street, gaining all his old courage and resolution as
  he went. For a bribe of a few pence a small gamin selling matches procured
  his brandy, and he returned to the shelter of Alice's rooms.</p>

  <p>The brandy was soothing, and he had plenty of tobacco wherewith to make
  cigarettes. He did not feel in the least sleepy; he took up the <i>Morning
  Post</i> and begun to read it, the criminal reports first, and then the more
  general news. Then, in the law intelligence, the name of Beaumont reached his
  eye.</p>

  <p>It was the report of the motion made before a judge at the instigation of
  Mr. Shackleton. Price had to read it twice before he understood the full
  importance of it.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm blest," he exclaimed. "Reads like a bit of romance. Here is my
  wife, Alice Price, as I can prove if it's worth my while, sleeping in the
  next room, living on a pound a week and earning it, when all the time she is
  worth £50,000. And it's all in the bank at the present moment in hard cash!
  Of course, she doesn't know it, or she would never stay here. But women don't
  understand law reports. The money will remain in court for a year, and at the
  end of that time it will be announced that Alice Beaumont, otherwise Alice
  Price, is dead. Now, is it good enough to declare that I am a lawful husband
  and claim the swag? Anyway, it's a comfort to know that I am securely married
  to a woman worth £50,000. Or shall I pin my faith to Minter? But Minter may
  go smash at any moment, and this is hard, honest money...Six months of my
  time to serve if I go back again. And I didn't escape from the police; I was
  kidnapped. By Jove!"</p>

  <p>Price paced up and down the room excitedly. All the time a plan was
  forming in his mind. He would keep Alice out of the way, he would produce
  evidence of her death if necessary. And as her husband, he would be enabled
  to claim all this money. He would force her to accompany him to the
  Continent. She would never know the truth, and so long as she could not prove
  her marriage, she would never let her people know that she still lived. It
  was worth undergoing a few extra months in gaol for a prize like this.
  Minter, on the other hand, was a slippery dog, and always the most dangerous
  when he was cornered.</p>

  <p>Price helped himself to a little more brandy and lighted another
  cigarette. Gradually his resolution was taking a concrete form. He put on his
  coat and hat gravely and thoughtfully. He went through it all over again, and
  then he put out the lamp and passed into the street.</p>

  <p>A policeman stalking along gave him a sudden chill and weakened his
  resolution. He looked lovingly at his cigarette as one who is about to part
  with an old friend. Then he clenched his teeth and quickened his pace as he
  turned his face in the direction of Covent Garden.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," he told himself. "I'll do it, if it hangs me. Fifty thousand
  pounds in hard cash! And the spending of it! Fifty thousand pounds! How sweet
  it sounds."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch59"
     id="ch59"></a>LIX. BETWEEN TWO STOOLS</h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE more Graham Minter was the man of the hour. Once again
  the papers were dotted with more or less veracious personal fragments; his
  portraits were trotted out again. People who had shrewdly suspected him of
  being a humbug and a sham were trying to persuade themselves that his
  financial reputation rested on a solid basis. His tradesmen smiled with
  pleased anticipation.</p>

  <p>Another week, Minter told himself, and these forecasts would be hard
  realities. It was a marvellous change that had come over his fortune in a few
  hours. Murdock stood behind him now, and that made all the difference in the
  world.</p>

  <p>If any one had told Minter that the whole of his beautiful strategy was on
  the verge of being wrecked by a woman with no knowledge of business, he would
  have laughed the idea to scorn. Yet so it was, mere girl, with love and
  sympathy and affection on her side, was undermining everything. But Minter
  knew nothing of this as he sat at dinner the next night at Marvyn Chase. It
  was more or less of a financial dinner, and there were men there of solid
  respectability, who hung on their host's lightest word. Kit Clive had come
  down unexpectedly, and he had taken Lady Mary in to the elaborate meal.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you've come," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Minter was laying down the law in his strident way, his big voice seemed
  to boom in the fretted roof. "Those business functions seem to stifle me.
  After dinner I am going to get you to escort me as far as Warnley Priory, and
  fetch me again after eleven. Does my husband think of anything but
  money?"</p>

  <p>Kit smilingly gave the requisite promise. He had come down on no very
  pleasant errand, but there was no occasion to tell Lady Mary that. Presently
  the cards were produced, and something like gambling indulged in. Minter
  watched; he cared nothing for cards. He had no desire to fog his busy brain
  for so meagre and uncertain a result. He was watching a grim battle at poker
  when Kit came back. He touched his host on the arm.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have a few words with you," he said, "if you can spare the
  time."</p>

  <p>Minter nodded. There was a curtness in Kit's manner that he resented. He
  led the way to the library and closed the door. He seemed to scent the fact
  that he had an enemy to deal with here.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said. "Cut it short. I have plenty to do presently."</p>

  <p>"I'll cut it as short as I can, Minter. Why did you accept my offer for
  those bills of Desborough's?"</p>

  <p>"Because I had no further use for them. I'll be perfectly candid, and all
  the more so because from the very first you had a pretty shrewd idea what I
  was driving at. When you suggested a price for those papers I jumped at it. I
  had got Desborough down pretty fine, and I thought I could do without that
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Kit said thoughtfully. "But that was not the only reason. You
  had a more powerful one."</p>

  <p>"Right again. You owe me a good deal, young man. You are a smart young
  fellow now, very different from what you were when I first took you into the
  City. I wanted money pretty badly lately, ready money I mean. In a few days'
  time I shall be in a position to buy those papers back at ten times the
  price, and not feel it. But, as a matter of fact, I can do without them, and
  that's why they were disposed of."</p>

  <p>"You had no idea what I wanted them for?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I had no curiosity either. I guessed that you had your little row
  to hoe."</p>

  <p>"Well, I had. But I did not expect to make a penny. That seems strange to
  you after the careful training I have had at your hands. I wanted to have a
  hold over Desborough, and to force him to give up his hold over Miss
  Beaumont. Therefore, I paid £10,000 for that evidence. Miss Beaumont wanted
  to free the man she had promised to marry, and so she also bought those
  papers."</p>

  <p>"And promptly burnt them," Minter interrupted.</p>

  <p>"No; she burnt some rubbish that you palmed off on her. In other words,
  you deliberately robbed her of £20,000. I am glad to know that it is not in
  your possession. It would have been to-day, but I stepped in and put an end
  to that. Really you go too far, sir."</p>

  <p>There was a sullen red on Minter's face. He could not meet the other's
  accusing gaze.</p>

  <p>"You may believe it or not as you like," he said, "but I never meant to
  rob the girl of a penny. I was going to try and teach her not to believe
  anything but her own eyes. Later on I should have restored every copper."</p>

  <p>"Provided always that you had the necessary number of coppers to
  restore?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll not defend the morality of it. I wanted the cash pretty badly;
  I'd have done anything for it. And then fortune, so to speak, stands up and
  flings it into my face. I should have told Miss Beaumont later on, and in the
  meantime I should have the use of the money."</p>

  <p>There was something almost brutal about the man's candour; it compelled
  Kit's admiration.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've stopped that," he said. "The money won't be paid. I came down
  here on purpose to tell you this. I'm not going to blackguard you, for that
  would not have the slightest effect. It's pretty clear that Miss Beaumont has
  told Desborough he is free, or he would not act as he has done."</p>

  <p>"But he's not free so long as you hold those bills," Minter said
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. And I am assuredly not going to be so quixotic as to destroy
  them. The fellow is a scoundrel, and he is going to be fairly punished later
  on. But he thinks he is free."</p>

  <p>"If you will let me have those little bills back for a day or two I will
  give you double&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind. My scheme is a perfectly honourable one, and I am
  not going to be mixed up in your dirty politics," Kit said firmly. "Money
  could not tempt me."</p>

  <p>Minter looked keenly at the speaker, and saw that he was in deadly
  earnest. Somehow in the last few moments the ground seemed to have shifted
  under his feet.</p>

  <p>"What do you say Desborough is doing?" he asked sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Moving as if he were a free man," Kit replied. "By a strange coincidence,
  last night he met Price opposite Mrs. Beaumont's house. Of course, you know
  that he and Price are old acquaintances. Well, he tried to arrest Price, and
  got badly mauled for his pains, all of which means that he is desirous of
  seeing Price in the witness-box. If he does get there, it will not be
  pleasant for you."</p>

  <p>"It will be ruin for me," Minter whispered. He wiped his damp forehead.
  "If that fellow dares&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will dare a great deal. Whatever are the fellow's faults, he does not
  lack pluck. He thinks those bills are burnt, and he is going to act
  accordingly. The ready way in which he tackled Price shows that. I should not
  be quite so sure of my ground if I were you."</p>

  <p>Minter nodded gloomily. This was a complication that he had not
  anticipated.</p>

  <p>"This is the first I have heard of it," he said. "If Price had been taken
  I must have been told."</p>

  <p>"Price was not taken. It was a very near thing, but he managed to save
  himself. But the police know that he is in London still, and will double
  their vigilance."</p>

  <p>Minter smiled. After all, Price had not been arrested, and he had many
  friends to shield him. The man, too, was wonderfully audacious and cunning;
  moreover, he had no desire to find himself in gaol again. On the whole,
  Minter began to feel easy in his mind on the score of Price.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "That's my business. I'm sorry about Miss Beaumont.
  You can tell her that I had not the slightest intention of taking her
  money&mdash;only of borrowing it. If you have any more to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Kit had nothing further to say on the subject. He had caught Minter
  out in a disgraceful fraud, a fact that did not seem to trouble his host in
  the least. Evidently the man had no sense of shame. As Kit crossed the hall
  in the direction of the smoking-room the sounds of the pianola stole out.</p>

  <p>"What a mind!" he murmured. "Nothing seems to trouble him; he has not a
  shred of heart or conscience. And he can be passionately fond of music at the
  same time."</p>

  <p>An hour later Minter strolled into the library, where an evening paper lay
  on the table. He took it up eagerly. A paragraph caught his eye&mdash;</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"THE MISSING WITNESS SENSATION. ANOTHER PHASE OF THE
  CERTIFIED CASE. ELI PRICE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO THE POLICE.</p>

  <p>"About seven o'clock this evening a powerfully-built individual, fairly
  well dressed, walked into Bow Street Police Station and demanded to see the
  inspector in charge. On being confronted with the individual in question the
  stranger coolly stated that he was Eli Price, the missing witness in the case
  of Mackness v. Certified Company, and that he had voluntarily surrendered
  himself to the authorities.</p>

  <p>"He states that he was forcibly taken from the police, that for some days
  he was drugged and kept a prisoner, and that he had only escaped the night
  before. On being questioned as to his assault on Mr. Clifford Desborough,
  K.C., he admitted it freely, but stated that his mind had not yet recovered
  from the shock, and that he had taken the eminent barrister for one of his
  old foes. He says he wandered about all night, not knowing what he was doing;
  but that directly his mind became clear he decided to come straight to Bow
  Street. The story needs investigation, but, at the present moment, the Bow
  Street people are inclined to believe that it is all substantially true."</p>

  <p>Minter tore the paper into shreds passionately.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the game?" he asked himself. "That man might have lain low
  and blackmailed me for thousands of pounds. And yet he does this. What does
  it mean? What am I to do? There is only one thing."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, and his servant came.</p>

  <p>"Pack a bag for a day or two," Minter said. "I've got to go to Paris, a
  message on the telephone. No, I shall not take you. Let me have the bag, and
  I'll carry it to the station, Peters. Look sharp. And you are to say nothing
  about this."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Minter was being whirled towards London in a special
  train.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch60"
     id="ch60"></a>LX. INTO THE NET</h2>

  <p class="first">PRICE had really given himself up. A great many people
  besides Minter racked their brains to know the reasons why, but the real
  solution lay in the hands of a woman alone. Minter had puzzled his mind, and
  given it up in despair. Price had so much to gain from him that the whole
  thing seemed to border on madness. Why had he done it?</p>

  <p>Other people were asking themselves the same thing. A certain City set,
  who had not scrupled to say that Price had been got out of the way at
  Minter's instigation, shook their heads as they read the news on their way to
  business. Of course, this was only a new deep move on the part of the wily
  capitalist. And then the incident was forgotten.</p>

  <p>People had read it with all kinds of feelings, but nobody perused that
  crisp little paragraph in the same way as Maude. She generally breakfasted
  alone, for Mrs. Beaumont took that meal into her bedroom, and the Countess
  was still too unwell to come down, though, just at present, she took as keen
  an interest in the daily papers as did Maude herself.</p>

  <p>Maude swallowed her tea, and then compelled herself to finish her
  breakfast slowly. She was too wildly glad to care for food this morning. For
  she had been successful, the scheme that she had thought out in many
  sleepless hours had borne good fruit at last.</p>

  <p>"He has done it," she told herself. There were tears of joy in her eyes.
  "I expected it; at the same time, I half feared failure. To think that my
  enemies should have provided me with the weapon wherewith I have defeated
  theirs. Thank God, my anxiety is at an end."</p>

  <p>It was a little after ten when Maude called up Kit on the telephone. She
  must see him on most important business without delay. Kit was at Minter's
  office, where he was winding up things, and would be round as soon as
  possible.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to come here again," he said. "When I leave the place
  presently it will be for good and all. What's the matter, sweetheart? How
  your voice is trembling."</p>

  <p>"Trembling with happiness," Maude said. "I can't tell you over the wire.
  Come as soon as you can, for there is any amount of work to do."</p>

  <p>Kit's taxi dashed up to the house half an hour later, and he ran eagerly
  to the drawing-room. Maude's face was all smiles and softness; her eyes had a
  look of deep content in them. She came up to Kit and placed her arms about
  his neck lovingly.</p>

  <p>"Now I am going to kiss you," she said. "Oh, I can do it now freely and
  shamelessly. I am going to send Desborough about his business and leave him
  to his own conscience."</p>

  <p>Kit's face grew hard. Maude might have found some way to get rid of
  Desborough, but the scoundrel was not going to be allowed to escape like
  that; Kit was going to put no premium on dishonesty. He was looking forward
  eagerly to an interview with Desborough.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to tell me all about it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Maude laughed in the most joyous, heartwhole fashion.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir," she said. "I am not absolutely sure of my facts. But you
  have work to do. Of course, you read in the papers that the missing witness,
  Eli Price, had given himself up?"</p>

  <p>"I saw that, and I confess I did not quite understand it. The fellow had
  everything to gain by keeping out of the way and blackmailing Minter. And now
  he gives himself up. Inexplicable!"</p>

  <p>"I can explain it in good time," Maude said. "I want you to go and see
  this man for me. You are to say that a certain young lady is interested in
  his case. He will understand that. Say the young lady is ready to find a
  counsel or lawyer, or whatever he requires. Get him to talk. And when you
  have finished, get Scotland Yard to lend you one of his photographs."</p>

  <p>Kit gravely promised to follow out these instructions. That Maude knew
  perfectly well what she was talking about, he could see. But she did not want
  to answer any questions yet. Kit went off presently to Bow Street, and there
  he found little difficulty in seeing Price. The latter was calm and
  good-tempered; it was pretty evident that his story, and the manner in which
  he had surrendered, had not been without its effect on the police.</p>

  <p>"If you come here from Minter, sir, I can have nothing to say to you,"
  Price said politely. "That man has been my enemy. He got me put out of the
  way, and Ericsson was the tool he used. Oh, yes. I've got a lawyer, and he is
  investigating the business for me. I don't deny that I've been in trouble
  before, but I should never have been here to-day but for Ericsson and Minter.
  I gave myself up as soon as I could."</p>

  <p>Price lied cheerfully and well. But he seemed more friendly and
  communicative when Kit delivered his message.</p>

  <p>"Thank the young lady," said he, "and tell her there is nothing she can do
  at present. What a splendid girl she is! If I'd had a wife like that instead
  of a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price paused suddenly. He was on the point of betraying himself.</p>

  <p>"You will want money for these investigations!" Kit said.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I shall. There's a useful witness up at Egmont in Norfolk,
  but I owe him £20, and he'll do nothing till that's paid."</p>

  <p>"I'll do what I can," Kit said. "Is there nobody else I can see for you,
  no relatives?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I don't want any relation to know what I have come to. I was
  once like yourself; I am a public school and university man. There is nobody
  since my wife died. She was a Miss Beaumont, but that is neither here nor
  there. The witness I want is called Chorsley, and he lives by Egmont Church
  in Norfolk, where I was married."</p>

  <p>Price spoke quite calmly as if giving a piece of ordinary information. In
  reality this was the first shot fired in the campaign that he had mapped out
  for himself. Kit smiled at the coincidence that this man should have married
  a Miss Beaumont whilst he was going to do the same thing.</p>

  <p>"The lady I speak of will find you any money you require," Kit went on.
  "Let your lawyer know this, will you? As a man of the world, you will see the
  reason for not having this young lady's name mentioned. But she is quite
  ready to advance all the money you need."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall never return to a convict prison," Price said with energy.
  "I've made a fine impression by the prompt way in which I gave myself up.
  I've given the police every assistance in my power, and I've only nine months
  of my sentence to run now. If I can prove what I say about Ericsson I shall
  probably get a pardon. And I shall smash that scoundrel Minter for good and
  all. Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>Price's manner changed; his eyes grew as hard as his mouth.</p>

  <p>"He's gone to Paris," Kit explained. "Was called away suddenly. I heard a
  rumour as I came along that he has met with a nasty accident, which will keep
  him in bed for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"Ay, and out of England for many a day," Price said with a bitter sneer.
  "Directly that man heard that I had given myself up he bolted. He'll never
  show up till my mouth is sealed. Why, bless you, when I get into the box over
  that Certified case and tell the whole truth, Minter will stand in the dock.
  And I'll do it; I've got a heavy score to wipe out, and it shall be
  done."</p>

  <p>Kit made his way thoughtfully to New Scotland Yard, where he was received
  curtly enough. There was some little difficulty in getting possession of a
  photograph of Price, but upon his giving an undertaking to return it at an
  early date, Kit went off with the picture in his possession. Maude smiled as
  she saw it.</p>

  <p>"Did you find the man conversational?" she asked. "Did he say anything
  about his friends?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't want them to know, and his wife is dead. Curiously enough, his
  wife was called Beaumont. They were married at Egmont in Norfolk, where there
  is a witness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Maude jumped to her feet, and clapped her hands joyfully.</p>

  <p>"Victory!" she cried, "victory all along the line! This is my Waterloo,
  Kit. My stratagem has been successful. There's only one thing that I want
  now, and it is on the table by your elbow. Hand me that Bradshaw, Kit; you
  and I are going on a journey."</p>

  <p>She and Kit caught the 11.49 for Patisford, and visited the rector of the
  little parish church. From him she heard that the register of births,
  marriages, and deaths was destroyed by fire three years before, and that
  there is no written record of any marriages before that time.</p>

  <p>But when Maude produced the photographs of Eli Price and of her sister
  Alice the old vicar distinctly remembered having married them.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he exclaimed, "I recollect them very well. If you want this
  marriage proved, I am ready to give evidence anywhere."</p>

  <p>On their return to London, Kit and Maude went straight to Paradise
  Buildings, and told Alice the result of their investigations.</p>

  <p>A gush of happy tears came to Alice's eyes. "And now I leave here!" she
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Maude, "for ever! And you are coming home&mdash;home to
  mother!"</p>

  <p>"Home," murmured Alice. "Home again! It seems like some happy, blissful
  dream."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch61"
     id="ch61"></a>LXI. HOME AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER dinner that night at the Royal Crescent house when
  Mrs. Beaumont had carried off Alice to the drawing-room, Maude told her plans
  to Kit.</p>

  <p>"I found Alice," she said, "and her husband had not the smallest idea of
  the fact, neither did he know that I had guessed her identity. After that I
  made a tool of him; I used him to extract information from Mr. Minter. But,
  so long as things were as they appeared to be, Alice could not come back. For
  my mother's sake, she stayed away. Still, she was married, and that had to be
  proved. From the first, it was pretty easy to see why Price denied the
  marriage.</p>

  <p>"Then I tried to think out some scheme to force his hand. It was a
  conversation with Minter that gave me my first idea. He told me I could make
  a big profit by selling my Certified shares now. And then I remembered that
  clause in my father's will. If I made a big profit, Alice would have a
  fortune. Well, I made my big profit, and Alice got her fortune. But it was
  necessary that Price should know this. As the daughter of a lawyer, I have
  picked up scraps of legal information, and I remembered that where
  difficulties presented themselves, it was generally considered the proper
  thing to get directions from a judge. My trustee agreed, and the application
  was made. I wanted Price to see this; indeed, it was more or less done for
  his benefit."</p>

  <p>"You clever darling," Kit cried.</p>

  <p>"It seemed very good," Maude cried. "If Price had not seen it, the thing
  would have been brought to his knowledge. But he did see it, as subsequent
  events proved. Once he knew that Alice's fortune was no chimera, he abandoned
  his designs of blackmail on Minter. He gave himself up. Why?"</p>

  <p>"So that he could claim that fortune when his sentence expired," Kit
  said.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. And he admitted his marriage to you; in fact, I sent you to
  see him on purpose to hear that confidence. Afterwards, he would have got
  Alice out of the way, have proved her death if necessary, and claimed the
  money. At the present moment, he is, no doubt, hugging himself with the
  delusion that Alice knows nothing. He will get an unpleasant surprise when he
  is released."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's one of the cleverest schemes I have ever heard of," Kit said.
  "And it has turned out exactly as you anticipated. There is only one thing in
  the coil that puzzles me."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, and I'll explain. Has it anything to do with Mr. Desborough, for
  instance?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. Alice is free, but are you free yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see, Kit dear, that one thing involves the other," Maude said
  softly. In defiance of all the conventions, Kit had crossed the room and was
  sitting with his arm about Maude's waist. "It was the knowledge that Alice
  was unmarried that Desborough was trading upon. He discovered the secret in
  some diaries of my father's, which had come professionally into his hands in
  connexion with the Certified Company case. He was in desperate need, and,
  with his guilty knowledge, forced me into an engagement. Unless I consented,
  he would let my mother know the shameful truth. At that moment I did regard
  it as a shameful truth. My mother knew nothing, and I feared that the shock
  would kill her."</p>

  <p>Kit's face grew dark.</p>

  <p>"I felt that Desborough was a scoundrel," he said, "but I did not dream
  that he was so utterly abandoned."</p>

  <p>"Forget him, Kit," Maude whispered. "Leave him to his conscience."</p>

  <p>"And to benefit at the loss of £10,000 to me! Well, we shall see. I have
  made up my mind what to do."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>At the same moment, Price was standing in Lime Street station, listening
  with an air of deference to the inspector, but really a free man. He hoped
  for a slice of luck like that, but he had not really expected it.</p>

  <p>"You can go for the present," Inspector Tate said crisply, "but no
  nonsense. Let me have your address, and come back here again at half-past
  three."</p>

  <p>What should he do now? Well, the first thing was to see Alice and get her
  out of the way. He had already fired the train by telling Clive that he was a
  married man, and that his wife's name had been Beaumont. Later on, he would
  come forward and claim that pretty fortune of over £50,000 as the legal
  representative of his late wife. All Alice's friends deemed her to be dead.
  He would get her to make a will in his favour, and date it back some years
  before. Once away on the Continent she would do anything that he told her. Of
  course, she need never know that she was legally married to him; the whole
  thing might be managed without Alice knowing anything.</p>

  <p>And Maude Beaumont was good for any amount of money in reason. He could
  get a couple of hundred pounds from her and slip away to France by some quiet
  route, say, by way of Weymouth and Jersey. He would pretend that Alice wanted
  a change of air; he would say that he had had a slice of luck, and that she
  deserved a little treat.</p>

  <p>There was nothing like striking while the iron was hot. He would go and
  see Alice at once. Price was in high good feather as he sprung up the stairs
  and opened Alice's door.</p>

  <p>"No work to-day," he cried. "I've had a windfall, my girl. If you
  fancy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Price stopped, for his usually ready tongue had failed him. The aspect of
  the room had quite changed. A man sat at the table by the window, with a
  shade over his eyes and some work before him.</p>

  <p>"And who the dickens do you want?" he asked gruffly. "If you are looking
  for the last tenant, you have come to the wrong shop."</p>

  <p>Price crept down the stairs again, much more quietly than he had come. The
  commissionaire had no information; the young woman had given up her room, and
  left the furniture in lieu of rent.</p>

  <p>"So that's your little game, my lady, is it?" Price said between his
  teeth. "You have moved to get out of my way. If I had you here now, I would
  give you one of the old lessons."</p>

  <p>All the same, Price was considerably humbled as he went back to Lime
  Street. The inspector was there; a foreign telegram lay on the table before
  him.</p>

  <p>"Have you got it?" Price asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not quite sure," Tate said thoughtfully. "So far, your
  information is quite correct. This is a reply to my telegram to the Paris
  police. Read it for yourself."</p>

  <p>Price took up the flimsy sheet and read as follows&mdash;</p>

  <p class="telegram">"Nobody answering to your description has been here and
  no accident. Minter is not in Paris, and, what is more, he has not been here.
  Shall we try Berlin?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Shall</i> we try Berlin?" Tate asked.</p>

  <p>"Not much," Price chuckled. "Try London. I can lay my hands on Minter at
  any moment."</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>But there were other people on the hunt for Minter besides Price. The
  report of the accident to the millionaire had found its way into more than
  one paper, though the accounts seemed varied, and, for the most part, lack of
  details was made up by speculation. There was a certain amount of uneasiness
  over the affair in the City, where Minter had been freely discussed
  lately.</p>

  <p>But Kit arranged with Murdock to come into the Certified Company, and to
  persuade Shackleton &amp; Co. to come in with him.</p>

  <p>That masterly stroke of business saved the situation.</p>

  <p>A few hours later Price formed one of a party of four on their way to
  Minter's house. The other three men were Inspector Tate and two plain clothes
  policemen. The little party arrived at Park Lane, and then Tate prepared for
  strategy. But Price boldly turned the handle of the door and walked in.</p>

  <p>"<i>Cat</i>'s away, the mice at play," he whispered. "They are all down in
  the kitchens. And as we shan't come out the way we went in there is no
  occasion to disturb them. Come this way."</p>

  <p>Tate followed with no further hesitation; Price seemed to be sure of his
  ground. He led the way up the stairs and into the corridor on the other
  side.</p>

  <p>At the end of the corridor a door was open, and a stream of light shot
  out. Before a table a man sat writing, a man with black beard and moustache,
  and dark eyes behind glasses. So engrossed was he with his occupation that
  Price crept close behind him and touched him on the shoulder before he knew
  that anybody was in the room.</p>

  <p>With a cry of alarm, he started up and looked with glaring eyes into
  Price's face. His fists clenched, he took one step forward, and then stood
  stiff and rigid.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," Price said, "let me present Baron Kinski. Baron Kinski in the
  flesh with his beard grown. Baron, will you tell me what has become of Graham
  Minter?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch62"
     id="ch62"></a>LXII. INTO THE NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE man with the black beard stood there breathing heavily.
  To a certain extent his face was in shadow, for the only light in the room
  was the electric standard on the writing-table. Tate regarded his involuntary
  host with a rather puzzled expression. By this time, he had pretty well
  grasped the complications, but, as a believer in the Bertillon system, the
  man opposite should have had grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have made a mistake, Parkes," he said to his chief assistant. "The
  eyes, too. They should be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Blue grey," Price said. "So they are. The dark effect and the extended
  pupil are due to the effect of belladonna. There's a hint for you, Mr.
  Inspector. Didn't know a man could change the colour of his eyes, eh? But
  you've got an artist to deal with here."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" said the man by the desk in a hard, deep voice.</p>

  <p>"Such an artist!" Price went on with mock admiration.</p>

  <p>"Baron Kinski! Baron Kinski was going into the City to-morrow to meet his
  business friends. He was going to take Minter's place. Bah!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden spurt of rage, Price flew at his antagonist, and wrenched
  beard, moustache, and glasses away. The transformation was instantaneous and
  complete. Minter stood confessed. There was no shame or anger or confusion on
  his face; he was like a mask. The marvellous scheme had failed. He had looked
  to success here, and Price had betrayed him. Why?</p>

  <p>"Mr. Graham Minter," the latter said in the same mocking tones.
  "<i>alias</i> Baron Kinski. Think of the simplicity and audacity of it, think
  of the houses next door to one another and the secret passage by way of the
  'Portrait of a Gentleman.' If I had not discovered that passage, I should not
  be here to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why do you turn against me?" Minter asked. "It is not a sudden honest
  impulse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There need be no talk of honesty between us," Price said. "I threw you
  over because I had a better and a surer game to play, and you would never
  have dealt fairly by me. And it was you and Ericsson who laid your heads
  together to put me in gaol. I have not forgotten <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>Price's eyes gleamed revengefully for a moment. Minter asked no further
  questions of his antagonist. He appeared to be utterly at the end of his
  resources for the moment. He was so quiet and restrained that Tate relaxed
  his vigilance for the time.</p>

  <p>"What is the charge?" Minter asked. "Where is your warrant?"</p>

  <p>"The warrant is in my pocket," Tate replied, "if you care to see it. Just
  for the moment the charge is one of conspiracy to steal certain jewels, the
  property of Lord Byngton. There will be other charges, but we need not go
  into them at present."</p>

  <p>"As you please. I am to consider myself your prisoner?"</p>

  <p>Tate bowed. He would call a cab if necessary, which suggestion Minter
  curtly declined. He would like to get his papers in order first.</p>

  <p>"The light is not quite strong enough for me," he said. "That confounded
  belladonna has made my eyes quite misty. Inspector, will you please give me a
  32-candle power lamp from the drawer behind you and a screwdriver. This light
  is only a sixteen. Thanks, very much. Please switch on the chandelier lights
  whilst I make the change."</p>

  <p>Tate complied without the least hesitation. Surely there could be no harm
  in a request so simple. The new lamp was handed over, the old one remained.
  Under the glare of the big chandelier, Minter took the screwdriver in his
  hands and fiddled with the positive and negative poles in the socket of the
  standard. The wire was still alive. It looked very simple.</p>

  <p>Then the steel of the screwdriver was suddenly jammed against positive and
  negative pole simultaneously, there was a sudden spurt of flame, and the room
  was in absolute darkness. Minter had deliberately short-circuited the
  current, and blown out every fuse in the house. It would take a couple of men
  an hour before the damage could be repaired. And it had all been done like a
  flash by the simple application of steel to copper.</p>

  <p>It was done in an instant. So quick and unexpected was it, so like an
  accident it seemed, that nobody moved for a moment. Price was the first to
  yell out.</p>

  <p>"It's a trick!" he screamed. "Anybody could have done it with
  two-pennyworth of electrical knowledge. He's gone!"</p>

  <p>There was a dull thud of hurrying feet outside, then the slamming of a
  heavy door. Before the alarm could be given, Minter was half way across the
  park. He had deliberately cheated his captors under their very eyes; indeed,
  Tate had actually handed his prisoner the means of escape.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think such a thing could be done," the discomfited inspector
  muttered, as he fumbled his way down the stairs into the hall. "Confound the
  place! It seems to be crammed with furniture. Hasn't anybody got a
  match?"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, nobody possessed that necessary article, and it was some
  time before the door was found. All this meant precious moments of liberty to
  Minter. Each second's delay was as good as an hour to him. It was useless to
  make an unnecessary outcry over the business. "We are bound to have him
  before long," Tate said. "He has gone away as Minter. He was utterly
  unprepared for our visit; I am sure he has very little money about him."</p>

  <p>"You'll never get another chance," Price growled. "A man who could work
  out such a scheme&mdash;so elaborate and yet so simple&mdash;isn't likely to
  blunder twice. He's got other cards up his sleeve. And I was looking forward
  to seeing him in the dock and hear the judge give him ten years! It's a cold,
  cruel world, and full of disappointments. If you don't want me, inspector,
  I'll go home."</p>

  <p>The inspector had no further use for Price at the present. The latter
  called a cab, and was driven off in the direction of Fleet Street. As he
  confidently expected, he had a pretty story to tell, and one of the kind
  eagerly snapped up by the newspapers. The climax was not quite what he had
  anticipated, but he had material for a sensational article of about two
  columns. The editor of the <i>Morning Review</i> received him coldly.</p>

  <p>But Price had chapter and verse to give; he had a good story to tell, and
  he wanted a hundred pounds for it. On the whole, it was cheap at the money. A
  little wiry nervous-looking man in glasses fairly bombarded Price with
  questions as he flung the replies on the paper in shorthand. At the end of
  half an hour he beamed.</p>

  <p>"That will do," he said. "This is splendid. Shan't want to keep you any
  longer. If there is any sequel, you understand?"</p>

  <p>Price nodded. If he had only foreseen the sequel! But he buttoned up his
  coat complacently, and, outside, took another cab, which he ordered to be
  driven to 45, Royal Crescent.</p>

  <p>He was going to see Maude Beaumont; in fact, she had sent for him. There
  was no occasion to slink there any more; he could be driven up like an honest
  gentleman; he could play his game freely now. Thanks to his own audacity and
  good luck, he was well in funds; he could take Alice away and remain with her
  till the time was ripe to claim that money. It would be rather slow, of
  course, but what a reward for his patience!</p>

  <p>On the whole, Price was on very good terms with himself as he drove up to
  Royal Crescent. He was ushered into the library, where Maude presently came.
  She was just a little haughty and self-contained, and there was a queer
  brightness in her eyes that puzzled Price.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you came at my request," Maude said. "I want to settle up
  matters, and I shall not require your services after to-night. I understand
  that Mr. Minter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bolted!" Price said laconically. "He's been playing a pretty game. Minter
  and Baron Kinski are one and the same. I found that out some time ago, and I
  put the police on his track."</p>

  <p>"This is strange news," Maude exclaimed. "Poor Lady Mary! But, really, she
  will be...And so you set the police going. Surely that was not like your
  usual acumen? I should have thought you would have turned a secret like that
  to much greater advantage, Mr. Price."</p>

  <p>Price grinned uncomfortably; he did not appreciate the satire much. Nor
  was it prudent to say that he was playing for a much higher game. Maude was
  very bright and clever, but she did not know everything, he reflected. If she
  had, he would indeed be hoist with his own petard.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the story," Maude said.</p>

  <p>Price did so, to an exceedingly interested listener. So there was an end
  of all this chicanery and fraud, Maude thought. She would be glad to get away
  from it and into the pure air of the country for a time.</p>

  <p>"It's a dreadful business altogether," she said. "Tomorrow I shall go away
  and try to forget it. Meanwhile, I have a little to say as to your own
  affairs."</p>

  <p>Price beamed approvingly. All this sounded like some more money.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch63"
     id="ch63"></a>LXIII. A DOUBLE EXIT</h2>

  <p class="first">"IT is exceedingly kind of you to take all this interest in
  my welfare," he said.</p>

  <p>"We won't go into that," Maude replied. "I want you to answer a few
  questions. You are a married man, I think?"</p>

  <p>Price replied that he was, but that, unfortunately, his wife was dead. She
  had gone abroad with him for the sake of her health; she had, unhappily,
  contracted a fever at Rome and died, in spite of the most assiduous and
  tender attention. Price conveyed a delicate hint to the effect that, if his
  wife had lived, he might have been a different man.</p>

  <p>"I was married at Egmont, in Norfolk," he concluded. "But these are
  wretched memories."</p>

  <p>"No more wretched than your own memory," Maude said, as she rang twice.
  "There are many things that you seem to have forgotten, and I am going to
  remind you of them. Please come in."</p>

  <p>The door opened and closed again, and Alice came into the room. She was
  dressed as befitted her rank and station, the pallor had gone from her face,
  she looked softly and serenely beautiful. Price had never realized that his
  wife was quite so pretty as this. Fear had given her a colour, her lips were
  parted, showing her white teeth within.</p>

  <p>"You see, I am refreshing your wretched memory," Maude said. "Let us have
  no outburst of violence, please. There are men in the house, and, if I ring
  that bell, you are liable to be pitched off the doorstep. You ought to be
  grateful to me for my preventing your intended fraud."</p>

  <p>"What fraud do you mean?" Price blustered.</p>

  <p>"Why, the attempt to gain possession of my sister's fortune. Ever since
  the night you tried to rob this house, I have known who you are; that very
  night I discovered that Alice was not dead. My desire was to prove that my
  sister was married to you, but not out of consideration for my
  brother-in-law. You had not the remotest idea that Alice's friends knew that
  she was alive. So I laid a plot for you, to force from you the knowledge of
  where you were married. That is why we played at that business of the
  Certified Shares and the application to the courts. You would see the account
  of that, and you would make up your mind to get the money."</p>

  <p>"It's good to be clever like you are," Price sneered.</p>

  <p>"So I have discovered for myself," Maude said quite coolly. "You saw that
  application in the papers? Had you not done so, I should have brought it to
  your notice. There was a prize ready for you, with only a little trouble to
  get it. You could easily get Alice out of the way; you could pose later on as
  a widower and obtain possession of that money. Only you would have to serve
  out your sentence first. When I saw that you had given yourself up, I could
  read your mind as clearly as if you had put everything down on paper for
  me."</p>

  <p>"What a mind?" Price writhed and wriggled and perspired. "Only fancy
  having a brain like that!"</p>

  <p>"It has been exceedingly useful," Maude said. "When you were in gaol I
  sent a friend to see you, and you told him all I wanted to know. It was your
  first step in your game. I have been to Egmont, where I laid your photograph
  and that of my sister before the clergyman who married you. He identified you
  both at once, but he could not produce the register, because there had been a
  fire in the vestry. There is no need to go into the history of that fire,
  though I have no doubt that you could give me some information on that
  point."</p>

  <p>"Inferring that it's possible that I had a hand in the accident!" Price
  growled.</p>

  <p>"I'm absolutely certain of it," Maude said, looking at Price with cool,
  accusing eyes. "The fire took place almost immediately after the contents of
  my father's will became public property. You knew that your wife had no
  money, and it occurred to you that it would be prudent to destroy all trace
  of the marriage. But, you see, we have found out all these things for
  ourselves. Your wife has the money; she is going to keep it. And so long as
  she has friends to protect her, not one penny do you touch."</p>

  <p>Price had no reply for a moment. Gradually he began to see how he had been
  tricked and fooled all along the line. The humiliation was bad enough, but to
  have been the mere tool of a woman was worse. He walked up and down,
  muttering and threatening, but Maude stood there, cold as a stone. From start
  to finish, not one word had come from Alice.</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing," Maude said at length. "You deserted your wife, and
  thus she is free from you. And the sooner we are rid of your hateful presence
  the better. Do not come here again. Alice, kindly ring that bell. I forget
  that this must be a trying ordeal for you."</p>

  <p>Price moved uneasily towards the door. He wanted to say something that
  would sting and wound and blister. But, for the life of him, he could think
  of nothing but vulgar abuse, and that would only make his antagonist's
  victory more complete. He found his way finally into the street, without a
  word of any kind. He put a cigarette between his teeth, and chewed half of it
  before he awoke to the fact that it was still unlighted.</p>

  <p>So, with all his cunning and ability, he had jumped from the frying-pan
  into the fire. He had thrown over Minter coolly and deliberately, whilst that
  man might have been an absolute fortune to him; he had made Minter an outlaw
  and a fugitive from justice, and all for what end? To be tricked and fooled
  by a woman! It was useless to expect to touch a penny of his wife's money
  now.</p>

  <p>He had about three hundred pounds in cash and his freedom. Well, he would
  have a holiday first; he would go to Brighton, and there lay his plans of
  campaign. He would take Macgregor along. He walked across Westminster Bridge
  to Macgregor's lodgings, but the latter was out. Very slowly and
  thoughtfully, Price retraced his steps. It was getting very late now, and the
  clock said it was close on twelve. The Embankment was deserted as Price
  strolled along, only one solitary figure came along the other side of the
  road. It was a skulking figure, Price noted in a preoccupied way, a beggar
  perhaps. The man crossed the road.</p>

  <p>There was a grip on Price's collar, and he struggled round. He was face to
  face with Minter. Minter, white and hollow-eyed, but filled with a grim,
  determined purpose. The tide was high, so high that it could be reached by
  leaning over the wall with a stick.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" Price said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I am at the end of my string. No money, no credit, face to face with a
  hopeless future. I am too old to begin the world once more, even if I had the
  means. But there is one thing I can have, and that one thing
  is&mdash;revenge!"</p>

  <p>Price struggled silently but furiously, and said nothing. He did not like
  the look in Minter's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I watched you leave the house," the latter said. "I was hiding in the
  park, I followed you to Royal Crescent, I waited for you outside, I have been
  following you ever since. I've waited for this chance."</p>

  <p>Price struggled still more furiously, but he could not break away. He
  would have cried out, but Minter read his intention in his fear-stricken eyes
  and had him by the throat like a flash. The man seemed to have a marvellous
  strength. Inch by inch, Price was forced back. He was raised and pushed on to
  the top of the wall. The madman was going to murder him. Price could see the
  rush of the brown water, could hear the strong suck of the ebbing tide. His
  hands slipped on the polished granite; he made one clutch as he fell, and
  grabbed Minter by the heel.</p>

  <p>There was a kick and a struggle and a furious oath, and then a dual
  splash. The two men were clinging together now, not in a fury of passion, but
  madly for self-support. There was a gurgling cry, another hoarse bubbling
  scream, and the sound of voices as a police lantern shone on the flowing
  waters and took in those black specks. A boat was put out from the far
  side.</p>

  <p>But it was too late. The hoarse cries had ceased by this time, the black
  arms had gone up, and the black bodies had gone down for the last time. The
  flashing zone of the police lantern followed down stream, until the nose of
  the boat came into the sphere of its influence.</p>

  <p>"I can see one," a hoarse voice said. "By Jove! I can see the two. The
  strong tide's brought 'em both up again. 'Ere, Bill, look alive with that
  boat-hook. Got 'em safe? But three minutes too late!"</p>

  <p>It was even as the boatman had said. Minter and Price were both beyond
  human aid when they were taken from the boat and laid out in the light of the
  river-side station. The sequel of the story had been told, but it would never
  be reported to the editor of the <i>Morning Review</i> by Price. A plain
  clothes constable looked in and gave a stare as his gaze fell upon the two
  bodies.</p>

  <p>"I know 'em," he said. "The stout one is Minter, the millionaire we'd got
  a warrant for. The other is Price, who was mixed up with him. No; more a case
  of murder than suicide. I must go to Lime Street and report this at once.
  It's a fine thing for the morning papers."</p>

  <p>It was a fine thing for the morning papers, especially the REVIEW. Maude
  read it and passed it over to Alice, who cried quietly and then smiled again.
  After all, it was only natural. And Lady Mary read it, too, but with what
  feeling will never be known to anybody but herself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch64"
     id="ch64"></a>LXIV. AMBITION'S FALL</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL London was ringing with the story next morning. The
  whole thing seemed amazing. A few of the newspapers seemed to know all about
  it, but, at the same time, the reports were vague and inconclusive. As the
  day wore on, more facts came to light. It had been feared at first that an
  investigation of Minter's affairs would have disclosed huge defalcations.</p>

  <p>But nothing of the kind had happened. Fortunately, Mr. Murdock had been
  lured into the breach, with the result that his name seemed likely to carry
  everything through, If Minter had lived another week, he would have found
  himself a rich man, but the irony of Fate had been too much for him. And
  there was that fatal business of Lord Byngton's diamonds.</p>

  <p>The matter was more or less easily explained; at any rate, the police
  theory was clear enough. Seeing that Kinski and Minter were one and the same
  now, it was quite easy to see how those gems had come into the hands of the
  latter. Of course, the "Kinski" business could not have been played without
  confederates, but they were not likely to speak now. So long as people are
  ready to be gulled by rogues, a dual identity business like that was quite
  possible.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to trouble about the jewels," Lord Byngton said. "Clearly
  they belong to the Countess, and, if she fought me about them, I should have
  to give them up. And I daresay I should do something silly with them, in any
  case. Let the poor old lady have them."</p>

  <p>Inspector Tate had nothing to say one way or another. Kit, who was
  present, thought that Byngton had done more stupid things in his time. So
  there was an end of the jewel episode. If Lord Byngton refused to prosecute,
  the police were powerless. And Amy Rayne continues to play to great houses
  nightly, and blesses the luck that saved her from a prison instead.</p>

  <p>Kit went off to the City after the inquest on Minter and Price. It was not
  a long inquest, and the verdict of "found drowned" had the full approval of
  the coroner. Murdock was just coming back to his office as Kit drove up.</p>

  <p>"We've got the worst over," the North Country magnate said. "All our
  shares have dropped a little, but not much. And when the City gets to hear
  that I have settled all those actions that Minter was so foolishly fighting,
  there will be a strong reaction in our favour. Do you appreciate how near to
  ruin we have all been, young man? Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Kit said coolly. "It was a case of do or die. And pluck
  pulled us through. Minter ought to have seen it, though, instead of wrecking
  everything in his mad desire for vengeance on Price. Strange, is it not, that
  Minter should have died a rich man after all?"</p>

  <p>"At the risk of ruining us," Murdock said sourly.</p>

  <p>"All's well that ends well. But you don't catch me putting my hand to
  speculative business again."</p>

  <p>It was a busy afternoon that Kit passed. He had taken pretty well
  everything in his hands. By the afternoon it was pretty well known who Price
  was&mdash;a gentleman who had fallen into evil ways. The story of his
  romantic marriage was a secret no longer. On the whole, it was no bad thing
  for Alice. And, after all, Price was her husband, and the family would have
  to arrange for the funeral. Lady Mary had come up to town, and she had
  implored Kit to do what he could for her. The one man now that Kit desired to
  see was Clifford Desborough, but he was away up North fighting a sensational
  case, out of which he was likely to emerge with honours higher than
  before.</p>

  <p>The funerals were over at length, Minter laid to rest in the churchyard at
  Marvyn Chase, whilst Price found a humbler resting-place. The blinds were up
  at Marvyn Chase again, and Kit was seated in the library, discussing matters
  with Lady Mary.</p>

  <p>"You'll never make me understand business," Lady Mary said with a faint
  smile. "I suppose everything must go. When the modern millionaire comes to
  grief, it generally means disgrace as well as poverty."</p>

  <p>"No disgrace can touch you," Kit said evasively. "There are rumours, but
  they will soon be forgotten. Your husband has left you a rich woman, Lady
  Mary."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary candidly admitted that she was very pleased to hear it. She
  wanted no details; indeed, they would only have confused her. By a mere
  accident, Minter's depleted property had blossomed again, and Lady Mary would
  not have sacrificed herself to such a man in vain.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you to take all this trouble for me," she said
  gratefully. "I shall shut up the house and go abroad for a time. When I come
  back, I must really make an effort to understand things. I don't know what I
  should have done without you lately, Kit."</p>

  <p>Well, that matter was settled, Kit thought, as he took his way back to
  town. As for the rest, Lady Mary must be taught what to do and how to manage
  by the highly respectable firm of solicitors who had managed her father's
  affairs for generations. Lady Mary was all right.</p>

  <p>The streets were hot and dusty as Kit drove along towards Royal Crescent,
  the glare was trying to the eyes. By contrast the garden behind Mrs.
  Beaumont's house was delightfully green and cool. Mrs. Beaumont, dressed in
  the slightest mourning, was pouring out tea, with Alice on a stool at her
  feet. Alice was in black, but by no means a sombre dress. To mourn for Price
  would be mere hypocrisy. Down deep in her heart the girl was glad to be free,
  the anxious, pinched look had left her face her eyes were clear and free from
  care. Maude Was dressed in her favourite blue.</p>

  <p>"This is charming," Kit said. "Let me have that swing chair and a cup of
  tea. Then I will tell you all I have done, if you will allow me to smoke a
  cigarette."</p>

  <p>"Did you find Lady Mary resigned?" Maude asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. Better be a rich widow than the wife of a heartless gambler.
  Lady Mary is going abroad for a time. And what are you going to do? The
  season is dragging on to its end. Why people, who can afford to get away,
  stay in London this weather passes my understanding."</p>

  <p>Alice looked up with a vague expression in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"We are going to Sandmouth to-morrow," she said. "Oh, what a treat it will
  be to me! Could you manage to come along, Kit?"</p>

  <p>"No getting rid of me," Kit laughed with a glance at Maude. "I am the old
  man of the sea, and I shall be delighted to turn my back on the City. What
  does Mrs. Beaumont say?"</p>

  <p>"For many things I shall be glad," Mrs. Beaumont said. "Of course, Alice,
  poor child, is the first consideration. And now Maude tells me that she is
  not going to marry Mr. Desborough. Under the circumstances, to remain here
  and meet him continually would be very awkward. Though why Maude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was a mistake, Mrs. Beaumont," Kit said gently, "the result of a
  trifling misunderstanding between Maude and myself. But that is all explained
  now, and, in short, if you care to accept me for a son-in-law in lieu of so
  brilliant a man as Clifford Desborough, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Beaumont threw up her hands in delighted astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am pleased," she said. "I had looked for this all along. When
  Maude told me that it was Mr. Desborough, I was really disappointed. Somehow
  I felt that she did not care for him, but I was very upset about it."</p>

  <p>Maude came over and kissed her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"And yet you never for one moment showed it," she said. "But you were ever
  the best and kindest of mothers. The Countess declares that when she comes
  back from Vienna she is going to live with my mother, Kit."</p>

  <p>"She might do a great deal worse," Kit laughed. "Still, I hope that
  Countess de Lary's relations will look after the old lady better in future.
  What time do you go to Sandmouth?"</p>

  <p>Denton came in just as the train was being fixed. He merely shook hands
  with Alice, but a glance passed between them, and they understood one
  another. Mrs. Beaumont rose and walked back to the house, saying that she
  felt sure the grass was getting damp.</p>

  <p>"Ever the most discreet of mothers," Maude said. "Now you can sit and
  smoke cigarettes and tell us all the news. We shall be out of the world
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>A servant came across the grass and stood to attract Maude's
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clifford Desborough is in the drawing-room, miss," he said. "He would
  like to see you for a few moments as he has very little time to spare."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch65"
     id="ch65"></a>LXV. THE END OF IT ALL</h2>

  <p class="first">KIT and Maude rose simultaneously; the servant had
  disappeared discreetly. "My turn first," Maude said. "You shall come in later
  Kit. Once I have got this off my mind, I shall be happier. I'll call you when
  I am ready."</p>

  <p>Desborough was standing with his back to the fireplace, calm and masterful
  as ever. Minter was dead and he was free; he had not even those debts to pay.
  And now he was going to bend Maude to his will. He glanced at her face and
  smiled, but she faced him steadily. Maude was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you came," she said, "glad you came for the last time. I have
  been discussing you with my sister."</p>

  <p>"Your sister?" Desborough said. "Your sister? Why, I was under the
  impression that she was dead!"</p>

  <p>"You are making yourself out as black as possible," Maude cried in
  contempt. "My sister is alive, and you know it. She has been frequently
  employed by you as a typist. You know how you kept the knowledge from me. You
  suspected that Price was her husband, but you concealed that. And Price was
  her husband. She was married to him some four years ago, at Egmont, in
  Norfolk."</p>

  <p>"And this you can prove?" Desborough said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, we can. We have the word of the clergyman who married them. We
  have Price's own word for it before he died. My mother knows everything now,
  the world knows everything. Therefore your disgraceful hold over me fails,
  you can tell any story you like and nobody will care. I have granted you this
  interview, though you would have no more than your deserts if you had been
  kicked down the steps. If Kit Clive met you in the street and gave you a good
  horse-whipping to-morrow, you dare not seek a remedy. This is the last time I
  shall speak to you, henceforth we meet as strangers. I have written to the
  papers denying our engagement. Now, have you any more to say?"</p>

  <p>Desborough appeared to have nothing to say at all. For once in his life he
  was taken utterly aback. For nothing he had proclaimed himself in this
  woman's eyes as a worthless scoundrel.</p>

  <p>"You had better go," Maude went on. "There is nothing to gain by staying
  here, or&mdash;stop, I have a friend who desires to see you. If you will wait
  a moment, I'll send him to you."</p>

  <p>Desborough appeared to hear nothing of this. He was not sorry to be alone;
  he wanted to collect his scattered wits. Before he knew it, Kit was in the
  room. In the presence of this man, he must appear to disadvantage. He looked
  up with a cold smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"You are the conqueror and I am the vanquished," he said between his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"Ay, you are more vanquished than you anticipate," Kit said bitterly. "I
  have read of and met some pitiful rascals in my time, but never a worse than
  you. But your claws are cut now, your teeth drawn. Maude Beaumont is free
  from you, and it is my turn to dictate terms."</p>

  <p>"Your turn!" Desborough laughed. "Do you presume to match your brains
  against mine?"</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I am going to do. I am a poor <i>écarté</i>
  player, and you are a good one. But if I hold all the cards you are
  powerless, and your good play counts nothing. I hold all the cards, and I am
  going to make you suffer. You won't get by me. You recollect those bills of
  yours that Minter bought?"</p>

  <p>"Destroyed," said Desborough, "by Maude Beaumont before my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, sir. It was a fraud of Minter's. I hold those bills;
  they are on my person at the present moment. If you refuse to believe me,
  look at them."</p>

  <p>Desborough's heart sank as he recognized the papers.</p>

  <p>He looked at Kit, but he could see no mercy in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Maude Beaumont tried to buy those papers to save you," Kit went on. "She
  thought she had done so. And then she asked you for her freedom. You refused,
  after all the sacrifice she had made. Had you shown her a bit of feeling then
  I would have spared you. What would happen if I gave these papers to the
  newspaper in your constituency which is opposed to you politically?"</p>

  <p>"I should be ruined!" Desborough said huskily. "I should have to resign my
  seat. Never again would I become a prominent figure in politics."</p>

  <p>Kit slowly returned the bills to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I was going to do that," he went on quietly. "But for the aged mother who
  believes in you, I should have done so. But, to a certain extent, I will
  spare you. Listen to my terms."</p>

  <p>"Terms!" Desborough cried. "Do you mean you are actually going as far
  as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As far as I can," Kit cried sternly. "You are going to resign your seat
  in the House of Commons. From here you are going away to do that thing; by
  to-night everybody will know that you can't afford to neglect your practice
  so much. Oh, you can wriggle and protest as much as you like. Those are my
  terms, or those papers are in the hands of your constituents within eight and
  forty hours."</p>

  <p>It was a bitter, crushing blow, the most bitter that Desborough had ever
  had in his life. For his political ambition he had sacrificed everything that
  most men hold dear. Honour and truth had gone to the winds. He felt sick and
  faint as he listened to Kit's words.</p>

  <p>"Not one hairsbreadth do I move from my position," the latter went on.
  "And I shall give you two years to pay me the money you owe me. Then you
  shall have the papers back again. If I could have seen in you the slightest
  trace of regret or feeling, I would have spared you. But no, you would have
  given up everything for the sake of your hateful ambition. That is a thing of
  the past. There is no more to be said. This is the last time I shall ever
  speak to you, the last time you will ever enter this house. You are going
  from here a broken and degraded man. I can see it in your face. Do you still
  defy me?"</p>

  <p>"I dare not!"&mdash;the words came slowly&mdash;"I dare not! And if ever
  my time comes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took up his hat and strode to the door. But, as he walked down the
  street, his feet seemed to drag, and his head, that was usually erect, was
  deep between the shoulders. In the garden, Maude was waiting for Kit. Alice
  and Denton were down among the roses.</p>

  <p>"He has gone," Kit said, "he will never come again. And I have served him
  as I told you I would. Now let us dismiss the fellow from our minds. Where
  are the others?"</p>

  <p>"Love and roses," Maude laughed. "Really, there is no reason why they
  should conceal their feelings any longer. And Harvey has served for Alice
  faithfully and well."</p>

  <p>The other two were down among the roses. Alice was arranging a creamy bud
  in Denton's coat. He made some jesting remark, and her laughter rang out
  sweet and clear.</p>

  <p>"It's good to hear you laugh like that again, little Alice," Denton said.
  "It reminds me of old times. My darling, you are not going to keep me long
  waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I am not, dearest," Alice said with a fearless, loving glance. "I
  long to make up for lost time. And I shall be more worthy of you now, because
  I am rich. Do you mind a rich wife, Harvey?"</p>

  <p>Denton responded suitably enough. He had waited for his happiness, but it
  was all the sweeter for the delay. Maude and Kit had gone back to the house.
  Maude stood gazing at Kit with a moisture in her eyes that was suspiciously
  near to tears. Kit caught her to his heart passionately.</p>

  <p>"Tears!" he said. "When you ought to be quite happy."</p>

  <p>She gave him one glance, and their lips met with a sweet content.</p>
