<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>01. &mdash; MRS DARKE'S DREAM</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 21 Jan 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
TOM DARKE was a man who in his own particular line was, in
bush parlance, 'a daddy.' His particular line was
'bull-punching,' or in other words, bullock-driving. Tom lived in
an outside district of Northern Queensland in the days when there
were still outside districts in that colony. He had two teams of
his own, and was doing fairly well, though his trips were
lengthy, laborious, and at times dangerous. The blacks in the
basaltic walls of the valley of the river, through which his
usual road ran for nearly two hundred miles, had a habit of
issuing out of their fastnesses on periodical occasions, and
making a foray for fresh meat and other unconsidered trifles, a
white man's kidney fat not being the least delicacy amongst their
requirements. Working bullocks were especially prized, as they
were quiet, and allowed the natives to come close to them, so
that there was less trouble in spearing them.</p>

<p>Tom Darke thought little of these dangers, a brush with the
niggers only served to warm his blood; in fact, there were but
two things Darke was frightened of. One was his wife, the other
was the chance of seeing a ghost. His wife, a delicate little
woman, lived at the nucleus of the township that was being formed
at the lowest crossing of the river before-mentioned. The road
there crossed the river, and went from its valley out over the
range, and down, to the coast to the seaport where it was
bound.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darke, as before said, a slight little woman, but the
proud possessor of a big bald-headed baby, lived there, and kept
Tom in order when he came down from up country. Also, when he
came back from down country; that is to say, the rapidly-growing
seaport where he delivered and obtained his loading.</p>

<p>Tom pulled up his two teams, for, as before said, he possessed
two, at the back of the little township, and prepared to unyoke.
His mate stopped with the waggons, but Tom spent his two days,
before they resumed their journey, at the weatherboard cottage,
which was his own, and where the frail little wife, and the big
bald-headed baby spent a not unhappy time while he was away.</p>

<p>Finally, having unyoked, seen the bullocks taken off to their
feeding ground, ail gone down to the river, and had a bath, and
changed his clothes Tom felt fit to go home, and visit the small
wife and big baby, with both of whom he had already exchanged
distant salutations.</p>

<p>Now, as again beforesaid, Tom Darke dreaded only two
things&mdash;his wife and the supernatural. His wife ruled him by
reason of her frailty, and the contempt she had for ghosts and
all belonging to them. It was a source of wonderment to Tom how a
little creature that he could have cut in two with has bullock
whip, could laugh at all the strange horrors the dark might
possibly conceal.</p>

<p>Tom, if niggers were knocking about, or bullocks had strayed,
thought no more of the dark than any other bushman. But let him
sit for an hour or two round the camp fire, and get primed up by
his companions with proper bush ghost yarns, why the darkness
beyond the circle of firelight became, to his imagination,
peopled with ghastly shapes of horror.</p>

<p>Tom's weakness was well known, and his wife had often tried to
rally him on the subject; and he had come to think that she was a
person whom ghosts would not dare approach, and before whom these
intangible phantoms of darkness, who occasionally gibbered around
his lonely camps, and peered with wild eyes through his
smoke-begrimed mosquito nets, would disperse and fly.</p>

<p>Great wonder was it then that when Tom came up smiling and
clean soaped, and took his wife and bald-headed baby into his
extensive arms, he was amazed to find her in a tearful and
affectionate mood, hiding her face on his shoulder, and
saying:</p>

<p>'Tom! Tom! I am so glad to see you back; I've had such bad
dreams about you.'</p>

<p>The bald-head baby said 'Gloo, gloo,' and slobbered as badly
as ever, and Tom stood aghast at the idea of his ghost-proof wife
being troubled by dreams.</p>

<p>'Dreams,' said Tom, adapting himself to the new character of
sceptic. 'Dreams are all tommy-rotters. Why, I dreamt the other
night that Snowey, you know, the near-side leader, was bogged in
a waterhole, and the dingoes had chewed his ear off, and taken
the eye out of him. Lord, I was up hot foot in the morning, and
out with Yellow Dan, and old Snow was as right as the bank, and
looking at me as he chewed his cud, just as if he knew all about
it, and was laughing at me.</p>

<p>'What were you dreaming about?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Tom, it was as real as real. You were standing alongside
a waterhole, a lagoon with tea tree scrub all round. It was a
dark-looking lagoon, with water lily leaves round the edges; and
Tom, you were standing there with such a look on your face, and a
gun in your hand. Oh, Tom, I couldn't have believed, you could
have looked so. Then I saw one of the water lily leaves move, and
a head come from out of the waiter. Tom, you put up your gun and
fired at the head, and then there was a great noise, and spears
seemed to come flying towards you, so many that some of them must
have hit you. Tom! tell me if you have had any trouble with the
blacks this trip?'</p>

<p>'Trouble, Jennie!</p>

<p>'Why, it's been burnt feed all through. Bullocks round the
camp every morning; seemed as if they were just wanting to be
yoked up. Never had an easier trip, and never saw the track of a
nigger.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Tom; and I've been so frightened about you ever since I
had this dream.'</p>

<p>Tom put his wife back from him, and looked at her. 'You,
Jennie, frightened of dreams?'</p>

<p>'Gloo! gloo!' said the large-headed baby.</p>

<p>'But, Tom, this was more like reality; it was so plain, so
plain; and, Tom, listen, the face that you tired at&mdash;the
face under the water lily leaves&mdash;was Yellow Dan's, the
half-caste boy you have with, you as bullock watcher.'</p>

<p>'You must have been dreaming. Yellow Dan is the best boy Jack
Morlock and I could have got! Isn't a better to be found in
Queensland. Fancy my going to shoot him? Must have been dreaming,
you must.'</p>

<p>Tom and the wife went in to tea, and before he started again
for the little seaport of Bobsville she had nearly forgotten her
strange dream, except when Yellow Dan came up to the cottage and
put her in mind of it. Tom came back with a full loading, ready
to start for one of the furthest stations out an the border
land.</p>

<p>'Tom,' said his wife, 'I'm coming with you this trip.'</p>

<p>'Coming with me? How about baby?'</p>

<p>'Lord, Tom, I've been with you before: and it's time baby
learned to go on the road. Why, in another year you'll have to
make him a bullock whip for himself.'</p>

<p>Tom laughed. He was none averse to his wife coming with him.
She knew the routine of waggon travel, and it was a good season,
and there were no bad stages ahead, and Morlock, his mate and
future partner, was a good man, and an old friend; so when the
teams left the crossing, bound for the outside station, Mrs.
Darke, ensconced on the top of the loading under a big white
umbrella, was one of the party, and the baby was another.</p>

<p>Under fine weather conditions they went on along the lonely
road that led to their destination. They had reached about
half-way, when one day they passed a lagoon, and Tom riding
alongside the waggon heard an exclamation from his wife. He
looked up. She was pointing at the lagoon, the edge of which they
were slowly traversing.</p>

<p>'My dream!' she exclaimed, bending forward to him. Tom looked
at the still water; the girdle of lilies, and the tea-tree scrub,
and felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'All these lagoons are alike all over the country; you can't
tell one from another.'</p>

<p>'This is the place I dreamt of,' she repeated.</p>

<p>'Well, at any rate, if I shoot Yellow Dan it will be because
he has done something to deserve it. So that's all right, little
woman.'</p>

<p>They went on some five miles past the spot, and once away from
it she recovered her spirits. Tom was doubtful whether to tell
Morlock about it or not, but she begged him not to.</p>

<p>'We shall have more company coming back,' he told her.
'There's generally one or two wanting to come down with us.'</p>

<p>'I don't want more company. Tom, but I want to get this trip
over.'</p>

<p>Tom felt highly uncomfortable. Naturally prone to
superstition, it was hard to have his fancies confirmed, as it
were, by the one who always treated them with contempt. Moreover,
the dream had so worked on Jennie's mind that she had conceived a
dislike to Yellow Dan, the half-caste, who before had been a
favorite of her's.</p>

<p>However, things went on smoothly, it was fine weather, there
was good grass pretty well everywhere, and they reached their
destination without any mishap.</p>

<p>After a week's spell they started on their homeward journey,
but no one was going down about that time, so they were of the
same number in party as before. They reached the camp that they
had formerly occupied, within five miles of the lagoon that Mrs.
Darke associated with her ominous dream.</p>

<p>It was late when they reached it, and then noticed that, only
a few miles back, at the base of the ranges, large bush fires
were burning indicating the presence of blacks. However, the fire
had not consumed the grass in the neighborhood of the water, so
they unyoked and made their camp.</p>

<p><br>
IN the middle of the night Tom awoke and went from under the
waggon to listen for the bullock-bells, but he could not hear a
sound. The old horse they kept at the camp for a night-horse was
there, saddled and bridled, but Yellow Dan was not about; and if
he was away after the bullocks, why was the noise there? Tom
listened intently, but could not hear a sound. Probably the
bullocks were lying down. He got on the horse, meaning to take a
short ride round. He rode in various directions, and tatted to
see anything of the bullocks, so returned to camp. His wife was
awake watching for him.</p>

<p>When he told her that Yellow Dan was absent she immediately
got nervous again.</p>

<p>'He came from about here, you know, Tom. He's gone away to the
blacks. They've driven the bullocks off, and we're in a nice
state.'</p>

<p>Nothing he could say could comfort her, and it was not until
the bullock-bells suddenly made themselves heard again that she
quietened down. Tom had missed the bullocks in the dark, and they
had only been contentedly lying down chewing the cud, oblivious
of blacks or dangers of any sort.</p>

<p>But the absence of Yellow Dan was still unexplained, and Mrs.
Darke again reverted to her belief that he had run away and
joined the blacks. Morlock, Tom's mate, who had been aroused by
the discussion, poo-poohed the idea. Dan had gone after the
bullocks on foot to turn them back, and he had gone to sleep. A
blackfellow or a half-caste could go to sleep anywhere, and sleep
like a top once he started. However, Morlock took the watch-horse
and went out to where the bells were now merrily jangling.</p>

<p>He was a long time away. When he came back he said, 'They're
all there but old Snowy; I can't see him any where.'</p>

<p>'He was always a bit of a hatter,' said Tom; 'I expect he's
not far off.'</p>

<p>Daylight came, but Dan did not turn up; and while the early
breakfast was preparing, Tom got the bullocks up, but could see
nothing of Snowy or Dan. Now the loss of Dan would be annoying,
as there would be no one to drive the spare bullocks and horses;
but the loss of Snowy was a more serious thing. Snowy was
everything a working bullock should be. He was almost human in
some things, especially when a steer had to be broken in, and to
think of losing him was dreadful.</p>

<p>After breakfast Morlock saddled up, and went out to look for
the missing worker. Tom dawdled about the camp and played with
the big and bald-headed baby, and 12 o'clock came and neither
Morlock nor Dan returned, Tom got restless, and Mrs. Darke
nervous; then about 2 o'clock Morlock was seen coming slowly
along driving Snowy.</p>

<p>Snowy, when he arrived, was in a bad way. His tongue was out,
and, besides other cuts and scars, his snow-white coat was soiled
with blood, and a broken spear was still sticking in his
shoulder.</p>

<p>'Niggers had hunted him nearly to the foot of the range; I
found him in a gully,' said Morlock.</p>

<p>'How is it they did not kill him outright?' asked Tom, who was
watching Snowy drink.</p>

<p>'That's what I can't understand. Strangest thing out.
Something seemed to have disturbed them. But what could it have
been?'</p>

<p>'Dan,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Well, I was thinking that Mrs. Darke was right, and Dan, the
yellow devil, had cleared out to the blacks, and driven Snowy,
the quiet old fool, with him, just to make a good meat. But I
don't think so now. Dan was mighty fond of Snowy.'</p>

<p>Tom was standing in the water by the bullock washing his
shoulder, from which he had drawn the spear.</p>

<p>'No,' he said, 'Dan never drove him off, but, perhaps, he
followed them, and spoilt their game. He might have got wounded.
You mind the camp, Joe, and I'll go and look for him;' and Tom
caught a fresh horse and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>'Don't stop after dark, Tom,' said his wife. 'You can't do any
good, and you know I'm out of sorts.'</p>

<p>'I'll back in time, never fear,' said Tom, as he rode off.
Morlock sat down to his belated meal, and Mrs. Darke went and
rescued a butcher's knife from the big bald-headed baby, which he
had crawled over for and succeeded in getting from the 'grub
box.'</p>

<p>'Do you really think Dan has not run away to join the blacks?'
she asked anxiously, as she soothed the howl of remonstrance that
the bald-headed baby was giving way to, at having to give up the
butcher's knife.</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' said Morlock as he partook of his food
with keen appetite. 'Dan comes from this part right enough, but
no half-caste goes back to the blacks, unless he's done something
bad, and has to bolt. Now, Dan's a fine, good boy, and far more
comfortable with us than a crowd of myalls.'</p>

<p>'But that dream; I can't forget that.'</p>

<p>'On that subject I won't argue.' said Morlock, 'I never found
many points in dreams myself, but, that is an a matter of taste.
Mostly I don't dream at all.'</p>

<p>Sundown drew near, and Tom had pot returned. Dusk gathered in,
and still he did not appear.</p>

<p>'He promised, he promised,' said Mrs Darke.</p>

<p>'Lord, you couldn't expect him to turn back if he was on fresh
tracks,' said Morlock, who was busy greasing a pair of bobbles.
'If a man is on fresh tracks he's bound to follow them as long as
he's got light; consequently, it's equally bound to be after dark
when be gets back to camp.'</p>

<p>Morlock laid this point down with such emphasis and
determination that Mrs. Darke felt somewhat comforted; but the
dreary night drew on, and even Joe Morlock, though he did not
openly express his feelings, would have been glad to hear the
tread of Tom's horse. More and more so as the night drew on, and
the distant fires under the range grew to a string of gleaming
light, and the curlews piped dismally, and a native dog howled,
in unison.</p>

<p>'He's dead, and Dan has killed him,' sobbed the missing man's
wife.'</p>

<p>'That's not according to your dream,' said matter-of-fact Joe.
'There, he was going to kill Dan.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Darke admitted as much, but added, in the illogical
manner of her sex, that Tom had not come back; so where was he?
This question being unanswerable, Morlock said nothing.</p>

<p>Morning came after many, many long hours, and Joe went out to
gather in the bullocks which he had kept rounded up close to camp
all night. He had brought them back, and was standing lighting
his pipe with a firestick; Mrs. Darke was making the breakfast
tea, and the bald-head was reposing on a rug and kicking up his
substantial limbs, and saying 'gloo-gloo.'</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a rush of flying feet; a yellow-skinned
figure rushed into the place panting and breathless, picked up
the bald-headed baby, and made for one of the waggons with it.
Following this figure came several black ones, and the camp was
full of yelling natives. Mrs. Darke scarcely knew what passed,
only she heard the quick firing of Joe Morlock's revolver, and a
louder report from one of the waggons; then she was knocked down,
and remembered no more. When she came to her senses, her husband
and Morlock were bending over her, the latter in a pretty damaged
condition. She herself had only received a blow on the head; but
the bald-headed baby had disappeared. Tom had been on the blacks'
tracks all, day, and riding from fire to fire most part of the
night. Then he returned to camp, just in time.</p>

<p>Morlock had given a good account of himself, and Tom's coming
turned the scale to flight. It was not until Mrs. Darke came back
to her senses that the disappearance was discovered. Then, after
her first agonised inquiries had proved the fact of his absence,
she remembered how the naked figure of Yellow Dan had appeared in
the camp immediately before the coming of the blacks, and how he
had snatched up the baby and rushed for the waggon. From that
put, at the moment, she could remember nothing more.</p>

<p>Darke gathered his reins up, and got on his tired horse;
Morlock was too much wounded to do anything.</p>

<p>Tom was out of sight before Mrs. Darke fully remembered the
incidents of the attack.</p>

<p>'Joe!' she cried. 'Did not somebody fire from the
waggon&mdash;fire a rifle, not a revolver?'</p>

<p>'I was too busy to notice,' said Joe, who was washing his
wounds.</p>

<p>'Get me a horse,' she cried. 'It was Yellow Dan, and he was
firing at the blacks.'</p>

<p>Morlock was too faint to attend to her request. The old horse
that he had brought the bullocks up with was still about the camp
with the saddle and bridle on, too quiet to run away. The woman,
in spite of the dizziness of her head, ran and caught it, and
before Morlock could interfere, had mounted, and was urging it
along the road after Tom.</p>

<p>Her dream had flashed through her mind, and she felt that the
end would be at the lagoon, five miles away, which she had
recognised on coming up. The lazy old watch-horse did not go very
fast; neither did Tom's horse, which had been at work all night.
At last the belt of scrub was reached. She went through it, and
saw the lagoon. Her husband was standing at the bank, watching
something in the water. His carbine, was at his shoulder. On his
face the grim cruelty of, her vision.</p>

<p>'Tom! Tom!' she cried, and he turned. She had just reached
him, when out from the lily leaves rose the head of Yellow Dan,
and with it the bald bead and face of her half-choked baby.</p>

<p>'Baba all right!' Dan said, when from the scrub on the other
side came a flight of spears from his relentless pursuers. They
were thrown wild; the two whites were unhurt, but poor Dan got
what there was of them that did any damage.</p>

<p>The blacks ran under Tom's fire, while Mrs. Darke ran into the
water, and received her baby from the arms of bleeding, wounded
Dan. They got his story from him before be died.</p>

<p>He had gone out on foot to look after the bullocks, and had
heard the blacks driving Snowy away. They had too much sense to
kill him close to the camp. He had followed them, and at last
overtaken them, and given them a sudden start which had dispersed
them for a time.</p>

<p>Then he found that they had come back, and were following him.
To keep them away from the camp, he had led them a long dance
through the ranges, and just at daylight had made for the camp,
and found a mob of them right on his heels. He had rushed in,
closely followed by them. He picked up the child to put him under
one of the waggons for safety. Had fired one shot with Joe's
rifle, and then, seeing Joe and Mrs. Darke knocked down, had
thought all was up, and had bolted with the child. The blacks
chased him to the lagoon, and he was swimming across when Tom on
his knocked-up horse arrived.</p>

<p>Dan was buried at the lagoon, and the fence round his grave is
the best-kept one on that road.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>02. &mdash; THE HAUNTED MILK BUCKET</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 Jan 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'IT'S a queer thing,' remarked Jim, 'but after you asked me
that question last night, I fell to thanking about it, and I
distinctly remember a very strange thing that happened about a
galvanised iron bucket.'</p>

<p>'You mean to say,' I interrupted, 'that you stopped awake and
made one up.'</p>

<p>'No fear. This is perfectly true, and I'll tell you of a man,
who you must know, too, was there. You remember Tom Sweeney?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't,' I said.</p>

<p>'His brother married an elder sister of Bill Burke, and, as
you remember, Burke was breaking out on the Paroo at the time you
passed down with cattle&mdash;or it might have been the year
before or the year after, I'm not sure which. Anyhow, you must
know him.'</p>

<p>'I'll be hanged if I do, and who is it, Burke or Sweeney, that
I ought to know? And which saw the ghost of the bucket, Burke or
Sweeney?'</p>

<p>'It is Sweeney you ought to know. I only mentioned Burke in
order to bring him back to your remembrance. I never said that
either of them saw the ghost of a bucket I said that something
strange happened about a bucket. Anyhow, I remember that Sweeney
broke his neck before you came up on the station, so I suppose
you couldn't have known him. He was there, at any rate, and was
the cause of what happened.</p>

<p>Ringfield was in charge then. I suppose you won't deny knowing
him? He was going to get married, and wanted a lot of heifers
broken in, so that there should be plenty of milk and butter on
the station when he brought his wife up. Now, there's no fun in
breaking heifers in. If they're not choking themselves in the
bail, they're kicking the leg-rope off and knocking the bucket
into smithereens. Moreover, between, ourselves, Ringfield knew as
much about cattle as he did about giraffes, and instead of
picking out nice, quiet, lazy-going Shorthorns, he pitched on
bald-faced carts of things, who'd yell and squeal and lie down in
the bail, and kick blazes out of creation. Naturally, everyone,
was in a bad temper; for we had to get up in the morning, and
give the doctor a hand, and we generally cussed
everything&mdash;Ringfield's future wife included. The time came
when be started down to get married, and he was to be away for
three weeks. Said Sweeney that night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was that after he broke has neck?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No; how the deuce could it be? No; it was before. And he
said, "Look here, lads, I'm sick of man-handling those brutes;
let's let them rip, and go out to the old Durham bulls camp and
bring in the same number of decent, quiet heifers. There's a lot
of good ones there, with young calves. I saw them there this
morning. Bet you two to one that Ringfield will never know the
difference."</p>

<p>'We all thought it a splendid joke, and the next morning we
turned the heifers out, and they were just as glad to go as we
were to get rid of them. That evening we had a nice lot of quiet,
packed heifers in the yard, and in a few days some of them would
walk into the bail without roping, and by the time the three
weeks were over the whole of them were like old milkers.</p>

<p>'Now, we had a young sneak of a jackeroo on the station. I've
had a lot of experience with jackeroos, and I've found them all
sorts. Some as wild as you can make 'em, up to any larks; others
sneaks, and I must say that, although I'm a Tamworth native
myself, I prefer the imported men. You can do something with
them, but the other sort think that because they are born in the
country they must know everything, and their conceit is something
stinking, that's what it is. This young whelp had never been out
of Sydney before, and he'd been sent up by the firm who owned the
station, being a relation of one of the partners. But I'm getting
away from my story&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You have run off the rails a bit'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's a bad habit of mine, I admit. Ringfield came up
with his bride, and she turned out a nice, quiet, sensible body,
who had been brought up on a station, and knew all about it.
Ringfield took her down to the milking-yard one morning, and,
would you believe it, that duffer didn't know that those were not
the same heifers, and explained to her how he had picked them all
out himself against her arrival, and what splendid milkers they
had turned out. What does that young fool of a jackeroo do, but
blurt out the whole truth might in front of Mrs Ringfield, making
a regular fool of her husband. Did you ever bear of such a
thing?'</p>

<p>Jim started has pipe again his disgust at the remembrance,
then he proceeded.</p>

<p>'Ringfield, of course, was very mad at being made to Hook so
small before his bride, and when he toad pumped the jackeroo dry,
and found out that it was Sweeney who originated the proceeding,
he had it in for him. Now, I do not believe that Ringfield ever
anticipated what happened. It was simply done out of spite, but
he never meant it would be serious.</p>

<p>'"Sweeney," he said one day, "Miss. Ringfield has taken a
fancy to that brown colt. You might try him with a skirt. See how
he stands it."</p>

<p>'Sweeney whistled. "I might as well try to break in the devil
to a skirt, Mr. Ringfield," replied he. "Why, that brown colt can
kick a mosquito off his ear nine times out of ten. He'll never
carry a lady."</p>

<p>'"Oh well, if you are frightened of him, that's another thing.
I've heard you blow that you could ride anything with a
tail."</p>

<p>'Now, this got Sweeney jumping mad as, of course, it was meant
to do, and he asked me to catch a horse and come out with him to
the One-mile Plain, and he'd try the colt with a skirt. So we
went, and Sweeney took a red blanket with him for a dummy skirt.
When we got on the plain he tacked this under his leg and let it
flap, and, my oath! that brown colt did go it! He never shifted
Sweeney, though, and he kept him going right across the plain.
There was one tree grew right in the middle of that plain,
and&mdash;would you credit it?&mdash;just when they were close to
it the colt put his foot into a hole, stood on his head, pitched
Sweeney against the tree, and fell over on his back. There they
lay, quiet as possible, the two of them, with the red blanket
lake like a sheet of blood, between them.</p>

<p>'I pulled the horse off Sweeney, but both their necks were
broken, and I could do nothing but cover poor Sweeney up with the
red blanket, and ride hell-for-leather into the station.</p>

<p>'You may imagine what Ringfield felt like, but the worst was
to come. Next morning the milk was taken to the little lean-to
used as a dairy, and Mrs Ringfield, who had taken the dairy under
her charge, went down to strain the milk into the dishes.
Suddenly there was a shriek that could be heard all over the
station, and when they ran into the dairy, there was Mrs
Ringfield in a dead faint on the floor, an empty bucket beside
her, and&mdash;a dish full of blood on the table.'</p>

<p>Jim paused.</p>

<p>'Now, this is a solemn fact! It was the same bucket Sweeney
used when breaking in the heifers, and you could milk into that
bucket pure, sweet milk, but when you turned it out into the
dish&mdash;it was blood.</p>

<p>'They tried everything&mdash;scraping, and scalding, and
scrubbing, till the bucket shone like silver inside. It was all
of no avail, and, what is more, the two heifers Sweeney had
broken in would not let themselves be milked into any other
bucket. They would kick, and bellow, and buck if you tried it on,
quiet as they generally were. So they had to be turned out
again.'</p>

<p>'What became of the bucket, Jim?'</p>

<p>'It was taken away down to an old hut on the river where
travellers used to camp, but it very soon had some holes punched
in the bottom, for a yarn got about that the water dipped up in
it turned to blood before it was carried to the hut.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. &mdash; AN INJURED GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 Oct 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
AN abandoned station is about one of the most desolate camps
one can find for the night. The corner posts of the old
buildings, the ruined fences showing the positions of paddocks
stockyards, and, perhaps a plot of old garden overrun with grass
and weeds, all combine to make one think of ghostly visitors.
Saddest of all is it when one or two graves, fallen into
disrepair, tell of those who have gone on to the main camp. Such
minor troubles as an absence of firewood and an appreciable
number of fleas are merely ordinary incidents. Perhaps the ruins
of an old roadside inn, with its heap of 'dead marines'[*] is
more pathetic still, telling of brief joys and squandered cheques
and bitter repentance and ruined lives.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Empty bottles]</p>

<p>Such a skeleton stood on the bank of one of the Northern
Queensland rivers. The road had been taken to a better crossing,
and the traffic had consequently shifted. There were a good many
graves at the abandoned shanty&mdash;so many as to make a
respectable cemetery. Of course, there were many tales current as
to the amazing fortune made by the former publican in what is
always known as 'the good old times.'</p>

<p>Is there any district in Australia that has not had its 'good
old times?' Some allowance must be made for the embroidery of
age. Probably the good old times were the cause, of as much
grumbling as the present ones. It was a matter of faith and
belief, however, that the owner of the one time Nine-mile
Crossing pub amassed wealth, and subsequently withdrew into
private life, under a rather dark cloud of suspicion over the
death of one of the occupants of the graves, who was well and
popularly known as 'Long Tom.'</p>

<p>As to others who had taken up a permanent residence at the
other occupied graves at the Nine-mile Crossing no particular
suspicions were entertained. They were simply the victims of a
good honest outbreak of a drinking lust on top of a constitution
enfeebled by malarial fever and other incidents peculiar to a
tropical climate.</p>

<p>With regard to 'Long Tom's' death the case was different.
Rumor said that Old Man Joker, which was the familiar name of the
former keeper of the place, had deliberately poisoned Long Tom.
Of course the thing was never proved, and Old Man Joker retired
into private life in another colony, and became an alderman or
churchwarden, or something equally appropriate.</p>

<p>It came about on one night in December that a passing swagman
had occasion, pressed by necessity, to camp on the site of the
abandoned Nine-mile Crossing. All went well with him until about
daylight, or a little before that time. In fact the swagman, who
had a poetic imagination of his own, described the time as the
first blush of dawn. Anyhow, he awoke to the fact that sitting at
the smouldering embers of his camp fire was somebody who should
not have rightly been there.</p>

<p>The trespasser was tall and gaunt; he was squatting on his
haunches in the most approved of bush attitudes, and he was
mumbling to himself in a very disquieting manner. Stammers, the
swagman in question, turned down the blanket from his face, and
looked upon his uninvited guest in a mixed mood of fear and
indignation. At last he aroused himself sufficiently to make the
ordinary remark of 'Good day, mate,' which he felt was entirely
inadequate to the occasion.</p>

<p>The figure at the fire turned lack-lustre eyes upon him, and
remarked, 'It was bluestone did it.'</p>

<p>There seemed no coherency in this, but Stammers saw that the
thing crouching over his fire was a horrible, shrivelled corpse:
a thing in which the only signs of life remaining were a pair of
phosphorescent eyes. The truth came home to Stammers that it was
no good shouting or screaming; there was nobody within hail, and
he was being interviewed by a ghost.</p>

<p>In these circumstances he plucked up courage, and addressed
the gruesome being.</p>

<p>'I don't quite understand you,' he remarked quaveringly.</p>

<p>'Bluestone did it, I said,' returned the phantom; 'that's
plain enough.'</p>

<p>'No doubt,' said Stammers, 'but it's not explicit.' He was
astonished himself, as he remarked afterwards, at his command of
the English language.</p>

<p>'Perhaps not,' said the appearance, 'but if you have time. I
shall consider myself honored by your listening to me.'</p>

<p>Stammers afterwards admitted that the ghost of Long Tom was
the most polite ghost he had ever met, which, considering that he
had never met any ghosts before, was a gracious admission. At any
rate, as he told the story, the ghost was eminently polite, and
worthy of a better end.</p>

<p>'It is a long while since,' said the ghost, 'and there are few
people come along this road now, so that I have scant
opportunities or making my grievances public. I wish to state
that my death was quite unfair&mdash;in fact, it was 'crook'
altogether, to use a vulgarism. Old Man Joker and I had a
standing grievance which we never could settle. It was a dispute
about the best method of curing sore backs on horses. I always
advocated a weak solution of bluestone. Joker would not hear of
it. I never could understand why he always got so angry when I
mentioned the subject, until one day when there were a lot of
fellows about, one of them burst out laughing, and said, "You
don't like to hear about bluestone, do you, Joker, you use too
much of it in your rum."</p>

<p>'Joker said nothing then, but when I came to think over the
matter, I judged Joker must have always thought that I had been
preaching this bluestone cure on purpose to annoy him.</p>

<p>'I must tell you that after this man's remark Joker got very
morose and sullen, and that the graves increased at a fine rate;
but I never dreamt that anything would happen to me. Joker and I
were such old friends. One day I was stopping here, and had a
cheque to spend, and, of course, Joker and I became very
friendly. One day he said to me, "Tom," he says, "you keep
harping on that bluestone racket in a way that really annoys me.
Give it best, old man!" Now, I assure you that I had not
mentioned the word bluestone for a month or more. Well, Joker
kept chewing this over, and at last he brought an old hat-rack of
a horse, and he says, says he, "Now, Mister Tom, you're such a
blooming swell at curing horses' sore backs, just cure this one."
It was a real old 'set-fast' the horse had, but I replied,
"Joker, I can mix up some bluestone which will put him right if
you give him a spell, and don't run the hind legs off him."</p>

<p>'Joker only laughed, but that night he came to me, and said,
"Have a drink, old man," and I had one.</p>

<p>'"Now," says Joker, "that's the last drink you'll ever have.
That's the dressing for the horse's sore back you have just
drank, and bless me if you could tell it from rum!"</p>

<p>'Then I went away and died, and Joker is alive. It was the
meanest trick ever played on a man. My grave is the first one in
the long row at the top. So long!'</p>

<p>'The morning blushed red in the East,' said the poetic
swagman, 'when I found myself sitting beside a half-emptied
bottle of square gin, which I had disinterred from the heap of
marines. It was full when I found it.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. &mdash; THE MASS-HASSA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 30 Dec 1899, 6 Jan 1900</h3>

<h3>1. &mdash; HOW IT WAS FOUND IN AUSTRALIA</h3>

<p class="first">
THE dead man had been drifting about for some days before he
was cast ashore, and then he was not a pretty sight to look at.
The birds had taken horrible liberties with his face; the sharks
truly had left him alone for some reason best known to
themselves; but the sea had knocked him about a good deal before
the top of a king-tide landed him beyond the reach of the waves.
Then the crabs had a word to say, and by the time the sun had
dried him up it would have taken a clever man to decide what he
had been like when alive.</p>

<p>But nobody was about there to inquire into the matter, or
trouble about the poor dead body. A point of rough rocks had
caught and rescued him from, the water which had drowned him, and
the rough rocks were the end of a point&mdash;a spur from a tall
hill that cleft the otherwise unbroken line of mangroves that
fringed the coast. On either side of the rocky point the
mangroves grew thick in the black mud of the shore, and along the
banks of the winding creeks, where the crocodiles floated and the
swarms of flying foxes hung in the branches and chattered and
screamed and snarled at each other in shrill whistles all day. It
was a foul place of slime and evil creatures, but the dead man
was past caring for that, and one place was as good as another to
him. The smell of the mud and the crocodiles and the flying foxes
was the same to him as the fresh sea breeze from across the
Pacific. Steamers parsed up and down, and occasionally luggers
and schooners, but none had any business on that desolate shore,
and the now unrecognisable corpse might have lain there till the
dismembered remnants were reclaimed by the sea but for the
accident of a dreadful wreck.</p>

<p>One day, when all was calm and smiling and the sea of the
inner barrier like an inland lake, a China-bound steamer crashed
full speed on to an uncharted rock, and sank in ten minutes. Then
commenced a search along the shore for any possible survivors,
and some of the searchers landed at the rocky point, and found
the ghastly thing that lay there. They looked at it, saw it was
none of the steamer's passengers or crew, so took it a little way
inland and gave it burial. But before burying it, one man
detached from the shrivelled neck a chain that was round it, from
which hung a large, irregularly shaped silver coin, on which were
strange Eastern characters.</p>

<p>It seemed of little value, and gave no clue to the man cast
ashore, so the man who found it kept it, and one day sold it to a
pawnbroker for ten shillings, and the pawnbroker put it in his
window amongst other coins, and there it lay.</p>

<p>One day a respectably dressed man of an olive complexion came
along and noticed the coin in the window. He entered the shop,
and asked the price. The pawnbroker said fifteen shillings, and
the dark man, finding he had not enough money in his pocket, said
that he would come back for it, and left the shop.</p>

<p>The pawnbroker put it back in the window. A few minutes
afterwards a doctor was passing, and he, too, noticed the coin.
He went in and offered to buy it. The astonished pawnbroker
considered. The Oriental-looking gentleman had left no deposit.
He might never come back. The coin seemed of more value than he
thought, so he asked a pound, got it, and the doctor left the
shop with it in his possession.</p>

<p>Then the Oriental-looking gentleman came back and fell into
rage and despair over the matter. He could not be brought to
believe that the coin had been really sold, but thought the man
was holding out for more money. In vain he went up to £5, and the
mortified and exasperated pawnbroker could only keep assuring him
that the coin had been really sold, and that tho other should
have left a deposit if he wanted it kept. The Oriental-looking
gentleman at last went away, cursing his fate in a strange
tongue, and the pawnbroker did the same in the language of his
fathers.</p>

<p>From that day the pawnbroker's life became a burden. Always
was the Oriental plunging into the shop, asking if the shopkeeper
had seen anything of the purchaser, and always was the pawnbroker
keeping an eager and nervous eye on the street, in the hope of
seeing the purchaser pass. But the purchaser was thousands of
miles away by the time they were both tired of their watch. He
had simply gone back to his hotel, collected his luggage, and
gone on board a China steamer; and from Hongkong he went to
Singapore.</p>

<p>And this was all blind chance, for the doctor, beyond having a
liking for foreign coins, had no especial interest in this one;
and the Oriental gentleman, who had no liking for foreign coins
as a hobby, had an especial greed and hunger for this one, and
would have followed the doctor anywhere to obtain it.</p>

<p>While the pawnbroker, who liked coins of all sorts on their
own account, became a morbid, miserable man, ever regretting his
lost opportunity, and gradually working himself up to a belief
that the coin was worth thousands.</p>

<h3>2. &mdash; THE WORK OF THE MASS-HASSA</h3>

<p class="first">
DR. COLGRAVE was seated with a friend in the broad balcony of
the Neptune Hotel at Singapore, and the singular-looking coin
that he had picked up in Sydney just before leaving was the
subject of their conversation, the reason being that Mantell was
an authority on Eastern coinage. He turned the roughly-cast coin
over in his hand, and looked keenly at it.</p>

<p>'I have no doubt about the matter,' he said, at last; 'this is
the Mass-Hassa, the missing one of the three amulets of
Zoabbarra. There are and have been emissaries all over the world
nearly looking for it, for when it is once more with the other
two the great prophecy will be fulfilled, and the Mahomedan power
be once more established throughout the East. And you say that it
was lying amongst other coins in a pawnbroker's window?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Of course I knew nothing of this Mass-Hassa business,
but I knew I should meet you here, and it was such a
queer-looking object that I went in and bought it for you.'</p>

<p>'You did not ask the pawnbroker how he got it?'</p>

<p>'No. From that chain on it I should think it had been worn
round the neck of somebody.'</p>

<p>'Somebody who did not know its value evidently, and didn't
know the risk he ran of being killed for it.'</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure of that; it would be less likely to be seen
there than anywhere. Is it considered lucky or unlucky?'</p>

<p>'Unlucky, I believe; but we'll look the thing up. I have all
about it somewhere. Thanks very much for the coin.'</p>

<p>'What do you intend to do with it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know yet I could sell it for a good round sum; but,
of course, I don't intend to do that; and yet, if I keep it, it
is bound to be stolen from me. Let's go to chow.'</p>

<p>A Malay boy had been doing some work on the balcony, but he
soon disappeared, but not before he saw the coin, and caught the
word 'Mass-Hassa.'</p>

<p>The amulets of Zoabbarra, according to what Mantell afterwards
told his friend, were lost nearly four hundred years ago, and
found again in strange circumstances&mdash;one in the belly of a
shark, amongst some other relics of mortality; and one in the
ruins of a Hindoo temple in Java. But the third had eluded all
search, and until it was found the other two&mdash;the Ras-Hassa
and Ram-Hassa&mdash;were as useless as a common rupee. Once they
were united, however, the prophecy of the restoration, of the
Mahomedan greatness in the East would be fulfilled, and the days
of the Sultans return.</p>

<p>Mantell and his friend parted, the doctor returning to Sydney,
whence he had come on a holiday, and Mantell remaining in
Singapore. He knew that in a. short time the whereabouts of the
Mass-Hassa would be known of, and he set himself to counteract
the purloining of the coin for the mere fun of the game. He knew
his life was safe, as those who were so anxious to obtain the
coin could gain nothing by murdering him when they could search
all his belongings with ease at any time. That they did search
them thoroughly he was well aware, but his precautions outwitted
even the astute searchers who were looking for the
Mass-Hassa.</p>

<p>At last, one night the hotel safe was broken open, but nothing
was taken, although there was a considerable sum of money in it
at the time. Then Dr. Colgrave began to be bothered. Evidently
the hunters thought he must have taken it back with him, and his
house got systematically burgled in a way that drove the
detective force crazy. In their despair they even collared the
unfortunate pawnbroker one night, and garrotted and searched him.
The whole thing was so simple&mdash;too simple&mdash;for the keen
brains of the Asiatics.</p>

<p>Mantell and Dr. Colgrave went out for a drive the afternoon
after they had inspected the coin amulet, and Mantell quietly
took the works out of his watch, and put the coin in its place.
It took up much about the same room, only it didn't work, which
was not required of it. The real works went into a neighboring
canal. The watch looked as well as ever&mdash;it was only
Mantell's business that it did not keep time, and nobody else
knew anything about it. It was only a common watch, not good
enough even to tempt a Chinaman, who would rather steal a watch
than anything else.</p>

<p>The one standard of great riches with a Chinaman is a plethora
of watches. But Chinamen were not interested in the Massa-Hassa,
and so the harmless watch reposed unstolen in the owner's pocket,
with the sacred coin inside of it; and Mantell laughed to
himself.</p>

<p>The next thing that happened in Sydney was that the body of
the Oriental gentleman was found in the harbor, and nobody could
find out how he got there. Evidently he had incurred the
vengeance of his employers in being so foolish as to let slip the
opportunity of securing the Mass-Hassa when Destiny gave it into
his very hands. That might have been the case, or despair and
disgust at his own incapacity might have led him to drown
himself.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the pawnbroker, who read of the case of 'found
drowned,' and went down to the morgue, recognised his would-be
customer as the man who was so desirous of buying the strange
coin. That is to say, he identified him to his own satisfaction,
but did not do so openly to the authorities. In fact, the thing
preyed upon his mind so much that it became a craze or monomania
of his that people were always around watching him, and trying to
steal his goods.</p>

<p>He stood this out well for a few weeks, and then cut his
throat, after chasing his wife all over the house with a
razor&mdash;a thing people do rather too often, after being a
week or two without sleep, and imagining that people are watching
them all the time.</p>

<p>Evidently the Mass-Hassa was getting in its work well,
although, strange to say, it was inside the case of Mantell's
watch all the time, and neither he nor Dr. Colgrave had yet
suffered any serious effects from it; but then, they had no
Eastern blood in their veins, and both the Oriental gentleman and
the pawnbroker had. Lucky for the two last if the coin had been
left reposing on the desolate rocks in North Queensland whereon
the drowned sailor was washed.</p>

<h3>3. &mdash; HOW MANTELL LOST THE MASS-HASSA</h3>

<p class="first">
MANTELL, in the course of his business, had occasion to go a
journey. It was short and safe enough, but it required, amongst
other things, that he should have a tolerably correct knowledge
of the time; and, under the circumstances, a watch, with, so to
say, no bowels in it, was useless. What to do? To carry two
watches would excite the suspicion of the boy who attended him.
He decided to leave the coin watch at home, carelessly, but in
reality carefully.</p>

<p>When he returned he found the watch gone; and heaved a sigh of
satisfaction, and thought that henceforth he would have no more
trouble; and that the Mahomedan greatness might be restored, or
not restored, just as Fate thought fit, provided he was no longer
worried.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. His belongings evidently underwent the
same inspection as before, much to his surprise. The fact was
that, during his absence, a Chinese boy came across the watch,
carelessly left behind, and the temptation was too much for him.
He took it, and left his employment in the hotel. Then he
examined it, finding it would not go; and alarmed at discovering
the strange coin inside, and suspecting a trap, he immediately
went down to the Chinese quarter, and sold it to a storekeeper,
who gave him a few 'cash' for the lot.</p>

<p>The storekeeper kept the coin for some time, and as the
delinquent Chinaman was silent as to his theft, he was not
interfered with. At last a party of English globe-trotters came
that way in search of curios, and the storekeeper sold the
Mass-Hassa to a young lady of the party at a considerable advance
upon cost price. He also told the story of its being concealed in
the watch, and the young lady's curiosity and romantic interest
being, of course, aroused, she purchased the disembowelled watch
as well for a considerable figure.</p>

<p>The party was staying at the same hotel as Mantell, and his
love of numismatics being well known, the young lady told Mantell
of her purchase.</p>

<p>'Have you shown it to anybody since you bought it?' he asked
hastily.</p>

<p>'No,' she replied, 'I put it back in the watchcase, as the
storekeeper told me it was when he purchased it.'</p>

<p>'Keep it there,' said Mantell, 'I will tell you all about it
directly.'</p>

<p>Truth to tell, he was somewhat disturbed at the amulet coming
back in this unexpected fashion; and wanted a few minutes to
think over it.</p>

<p>The extraordinary return of the coin rather aroused his
superstition. He took the young lady aside, and told her the
story of the 'Mass-Hassa.'</p>

<p>She felt rather uncomfortable. She did not like to part with
such a rare and singular curio, but if she kept it, it would be
most certainly taken from her, and probably in some startling and
disagreeable manner. Also the idea of having her wardrobe and
belongings periodically and secretly ransacked did not commend
itself to the feminine mind.</p>

<p>It is true she could keep it concealed in the watch-case, but
what was the good of possessing a curiosity which you could not
exhibit? She felt inclined to sell it to any Malay who wanted it,
and consulted Mantell on the subject.</p>

<p>'There might be something in that,' said Mantell. 'Now let me
turn the question over in my mind for four and twenty hours;
meanwhile you don't mind keeping the Mass-Hassa for that length
of time. Nobody as yet knows that you have it, so I don't suppose
you will be troubled very much at present. To-morrow I will have
arranged some plan.'</p>

<p>To this, Miss Curtis, which was the name of the young lady,
assented, and, acting on Mantell's advice, left the dummy watch
carelessly lying about. Now the Chinese boy, who had stolen the
watch and sold it to the storekeeper, finding work hard to get,
went back to the Neptune Hotel and succeeded in getting
employment again as a sweeper. That evening, while dinner was In
progress, he was employed in the passage from which Miss Curtis's
bedroom opened, and influenced by insatiable curiosity, he peeped
in to see if any unconsidered trifles were knocking about, and
espied the watch on the dressing-table. A watch! He went in and
had a look at it. It appeared familiar. He opened it. There lay
the fatal coin that had so frightened him before. It had come
back again to haunt him; it was a devil, surely; and dropping it
hastily he fled along the passage and away downstairs, charging
recklessly through the diners emerging from the dining-room.</p>

<p>Then a cry arose that a man was running amok, and a Sikh
policeman shot him in the street. Miss Curtis found the coin and
watch-case lying on the floor, and put them away before anybody
else had seen them. She told Mantell of the occurrence, and he,
with his knowledge of eastern life, was not long in piecing out
the facts of the case. But, truth to tell, it made him feel very
uncomfortable. It seemed as though the Mass-Hassa got its work
in, slowly but surely; but it got it in all the same.</p>

<p>He called on a friend of his who ran a coastal steamer line,
and asked him to inform any Malay gentleman of influence whom he
might know that if he would call upon him (Mantell) at the
Neptune Hotel he (Mantell) had an important communication to make
to him. His friend told him that he knew many Malay gentlemen of
influence and importance, and that Mantell could rely upon one
calling on him shortly.</p>

<p>In fact, soon after breakfast a Malay gentleman put in an
appearance at the Neptune and asked for Mr. Mantell.</p>

<p>'I presume,' he said quietly, in perfectly correct English,
'that you want to see me about the Mass-Hassa. Of course, I know
that it was in your possession for a short time, but you have not
got it now. Perhaps you wish to tell me where it is. It is no
good beating about the bush in questions of this sort.'</p>

<p>'I have no intention of doing so,' said Mantell; 'but may I
ask for your credentials in the matter?'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's my name; but I don't generally use it. Really, I
am the Hereditary Sultan of Pedir, but at present the Saguin is
representing me. My Mukim is XXV.,' he went on, indicating that,
number on his card. 'Perhaps you have heard of it in the course
of your studies?'</p>

<p>'I have. I presume you are the man who bought the
breechloaders in Belgium, and smuggled them in so cleverly under
the bows of the Dutch gunboats?'</p>

<p>The man in question laughed lightly, and answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>'If you can put me on the track of the Mass-Hassa it will be
worth more to me than twice twenty thousand breechloaders. Now,
can you do it or not? I know that you have not got it in your own
keeping, but I presume you are acting for somebody else. If it's
money, mention the sum. Mind you, I give you all credit for your
cuteness; but it won't last for ever. We'll get it in the
end&mdash;and perhaps have to resort to unpleasant methods. No
Chinaman will take charge of it now.'</p>

<p>'No. I never asked any Chinaman to take charge of it. But why
the remark?'</p>

<p>'Well, we have warned the Chinese, and by way of enforcing the
warning the Chinese storekeeper who bought the Mass-Hassa from
another Chinaman, whom you gave it to, was killed last
night&mdash;executed, I mean. The fool of a policeman who shot
the man, who was supposed to be running amok last night, did it
too well, and the wretch only lived long enough to utter the
storekeeper's name, otherwise we should have round out more.'</p>

<p>Mantell smiled. 'You're a clever fellow in your own way, but
you are too clever. I fooled you without' any trouble at all; and
I never gave it to any Chinaman to take care of.'</p>

<p>The Sultan of Pedir looked annoyed. 'Jesting is all very well,
but if what you say is true there will be a good many lives
sacrificed over it.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! That does not trouble me in the least. Now, what, do
you value this coin at?'</p>

<p>The Malay gentleman wrote something on a piece of paper, and
handed it to Mantell. Mantell looked at it.</p>

<p>'You think highly of it,' he said. 'Far more than I do.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' he said, rather contemptuously, 'you do hot and cannot
understand. . Money is nothing in this matter.'</p>

<p>'Apparently so. Well, to end all trouble you shall have it.
Barring all accidents of your creation, if you call this
afternoon, say 4 o'clock, it is yours. I have not got it. You
will believe that?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. There will be no accidents of my creating. Until 4
o'clock!'</p>

<p>And, with a pleasant expression of face the Sultan of Pedir
departed.</p>

<h3>4. &mdash; WHERE THE MASS-HASSA IS NOW</h3>

<p class="first">
MANTELL consulted Miss Curtis, who fell back on her father for
advice. At first her father was against taking such a large sum
of money for such a paltry-looking coin, but Mantell showed him
his mistake, and on condition that Mantell took a certain portion
he agreed to his daughter accepting it. When 4 o'clock arrived
the Malay gentleman was shown into the room, and there found
Mantell and Miss Curtis. He betrayed no outward surprise at the
lady's presence, but Mantell knew that he felt a good deal.</p>

<p>'This gentleman,' said Mantell to Miss Curtis, 'is the bearer
of a title I am not at liberty to mention, but he is fully
empowered to treat for the Mass-Hassa. Have I your permission to
hand it to him in return for his cheque for the amount agreed
upon?'</p>

<p>Miss Curtis signified that he had.</p>

<p>The Sultan looked at Mantell while he drew his watch out of
his pocket, opened it, and showed him the Mass-Hassa reposing
therein. His eyes glittered, and he ground his teeth. Mantell
felt sorry for his baffled emissaries.</p>

<p>'Has it been there all along?' he asked.</p>

<p>'In the watch case, yes; in my possession, no. Miss Curtis is
at present the owner of it.'</p>

<p>The Sultan took out a pocketbook and extracted a cheque from
it, which he handed, to Mantell.</p>

<p>'That will be enough between us,' he said, and Mantell
assented. 'You will probably hear of me again,' he said,
meaningly.</p>

<p>'I hope so, and I hope as successful.'</p>

<p>'I am sure of It now I hold this,' replied the Malay, and
bowing to Miss Curtis he left the room.</p>

<p>'What does he mean?' she asked of her companion.</p>

<p>'Only that he is engaged in an insurrection against the Dutch,
and I trust he will win. We are not interested, in it, Miss
Curtis.'</p>

<p>The cheque was duly honored, and the Mass-Hassa from that day
passed out of the ken of the Europeans who had, up to then,
handled and seen it.</p>

<p>The Sultan of Pedir made two unsuccessful attempts to land at
a certain port in Sumatra, and each time was chased by Dutch
gunboats. So he went away to Australia, meaning to return in a
British ship as an Australian passenger, and go a different way
about reaching his destination. The two amulets were waiting for
the third, and until the three were complete and united, the
spell of the Hassa had no effect.</p>

<p>The steamer he was on ran into the biggest cyclone that had
been known on the northern coast for some years. Luggers and
schooners belonging to the pearling fleets were wrecked by the
score. The steamer got through all right, but she had two
passengers and two of the crew washed overboard and drowned.</p>

<p>One of the passengers was the Sultan of Pedir. His body was
washed ashore with those of other victims, and the blacks found
them and gave them burial. One of the natives found the
Mass-Hassa on the body and kept it. Afterwards he traded it off
on a shanty keeper for rum, and the shanty keeper getting wroth
about it fired a charge of shot at him, meaning only to pepper
him, but unfortunately it killed him. Then the white had to stand
his trial, and was sentenced to ten years' hard labor.</p>

<p>Somebody bought his shanty, and the Mass-Hassa went with it. A
considerable number of men died of the horrors at the shanty
during the time the Mass-Hassa was there&mdash;considerably over
the average.</p>

<p>One of the children of the shanty keeper was playing with it
one day, and a man who was there took a fancy to it and bought
it. He put it in his 'saddle pouch' and went away with two
bottles of sudden death in his pack. He was found dead on a dry
stage, but his horse was never found, and it and the Mass-Hassa
are adrift somewhere in the Australian continent at the present
time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the companion amulets are waiting.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. &mdash; OF THE TROUBLE CAUSED BY TIMOTHY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 31 Aug 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
BIG BILL the carrier was on one of his periodical bursts. Bill
was quarrelsome in his cups, therefore his 'benders' brought only
a qualified joy to the heart of the local publican, for ma
abusive tongue and pugnacious temper kept the good paying
customers out of the bar. It was only the loafing fraternity who
were willing to put up with Bill's foul language on the
off-chance of his shouting for them, who mustered up when Bill
was on the red path of war.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Big Bill when sober was one of the quietest
most peaceable and long-suffering of men. His motto then was not
'Peace with honor,' but 'Peace at any price.' Nobody had ever
known him to fight when sober; nobody had ever known him to do
anything but go round spoiling for a fight when he was drunk.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion he was determined to put a
saturated solution of carmine on the whole township. He commenced
on his satellites, and, having discomfited them, horse and foot,
he started off to the black's camp, announcing his intention of
taking it out of Timothy, as there was not a white man in the
whole town. Timothy was an ex-trooper of the native police, an
untamable rebel against all authority. His last exploit, namely,
almost biting his officer's thumb off, and nearly causing that
individual's death of lockjaw, had procured him a lengthened
imprisonment and his discharge. He was a splendid police boy on
active service, but in camp none of the acting
vice-sub-inspectors cared to have anything to do with him. He was
not tall, but had a chest, neck and arms resembling Sandow of the
present day, and could use his 'dooks' like a professional; in
fact, but for the impossibility of training him, he would have
figured in the ring.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Big Bill announced his intention of taking it
out of Timothy in default of any white man showing an inclination
to accept the challenge he threw out at the colonies in general,
public curiosity was excited, and public curiosity wended its way
to the nigger's camp to witness the trouble. Timothy was enjoying
a siesta under the shade of a tree when Big Bill strode up and
gave him a violent kick, which would have broken the ribs of an
ordinary white man, telling him at the same time to get up, for a
lazy blank, blank nigger, who had no business to be snoring in
the daytime, when white men had to work.</p>

<p>'Not that there axe any white men in this blankest of blank
towns,' he concluded, 'but then there might have been.' To the
astonishment of everybody, Timothy lay quite still and did not at
once spring to his feet and resent the assault. On the contrary,
he groaned heavily and lay quiet. Bill bestowed another kick on
him, telling him not to lie shamming there any longer, but
Timothy did not respond. One of the bystanders advanced, and
stooping over the recumbent figure, looked up at Bill and said,
'You've killed him!'</p>

<p>At this Timothy's two gins set up a hideous wailing, and
commenced to scratch themselves with their nails. One
brown-legged, barefooted lad started back to the township and
informed the sergeant that Big Bill had just kicked Timothy to
death; and another brown-legged, barefooted boy ran him a dead
heat to fetch the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor was 'sleeping it off,' but the chemist, an ex-good
young man, who when he first arrived had tried to start a Sunday
school, but had at last gone over to whisky and the enemy, came
in hid stead. The sergeant put on his uniform jumper, and,
accompanied by one of his men, went down to the scene of the I
tragedy. The chemist pronounced Timothy dead offhand.</p>

<p>Bill, who was now stupid and quiet, went off peaceably to the
logs with the two guardians of law and order. Everybody else left
to get a drink; and the two gins, having obtained some pieces of
glass, proceeded to cut themselves properly.</p>

<p>Timothy, however, was not by any means a corpse. True, Bill's
first savage kick had landed just on the region of the heart and
brought on a sudden swoon, but he presently revived, and having
been informed of what had happened retired to his gunyah to rest,
after having belabored the two bescratched gins.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the coach arrived that night, and with
it came an eminent German scientist, who had come out to the far,
far west in search of a reported hairless tribe of aborigines.
The said hairless tribe having originated in the distempered
imagination of a man in the horrors.</p>

<p>The eminent scientist was vainly pursuing this hairless tribe
towards the anterior when he arrived at the township. Naturally
the tragedy of the afternoon was the staple subject of
conversation, and if the massive frame and Herculean proportions
of Timothy did not lose in the description. Naturally, too, the
scientist, who was an enthusiastic anthropologist, was deeply
interested and, failing the hairless race, determined to secure
such a fancy aboriginal specimen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another scene in the drama was being enacted.
Timothy, finding that he was a presumed defunct, commanded the
two lately chastised gins to go and procure a bottle of rum to
celebrate his decease.</p>

<p>Whether they would have succeeded or not in their mission
cannot be said, but a genial and drunken Irishman, finding out
their errand, vowed that the poor cratur should not want for a
dacent wake, and procured and presented them with three bottles
of 'kill at forty yards.'</p>

<p>On their return with the spoil Timothy promptly annexed the
plunder, and having speedily drunk himself into insensibility,
the other blacks secured the remainder and made merry. The sounds
of revelry by night died down in the township at last and the
eminent scientist, seizing the opportunity when the
partially-intoxicated landlord was closing the bar, drew him on
one side and requested that astounded individual in broken
English to sell him a hogshead of rum.</p>

<p>Now, as the publican made the greater part of his own liquor,
and had only a small supply of 'real Mackay' on the premises,
this magnificent and Gargantuan order naturally surprised and
sobered him. Finally be sized his customer up and came to a
sudden resolution. He informed the eminent that his stock had run
low, and he could not furnish the amount required, but, if the
eminent would be contented with a smaller quantity, he might
manage it. The eminent considered, and finally replied slowly,
'If you cannot, as you call it, "manage," a smaller number may
serve, sufficient, let us say, to cook his head.'</p>

<p>The publican staggered; he had a hazy idea of the habits of
foreigners, especially Germans, and he asked aghast, 'Are you
going to eat it?'</p>

<p>'Eat it? My God! No; I would keep it&mdash;preserve it, as a
specimen.'</p>

<p>The landlord dropped to the situation.</p>

<p>'I have something that will do equally well'&mdash;he lowered
his voice&mdash;'methylated spirits.'</p>

<p>'The very thing,' and his guest caught his hand and wrung
it.</p>

<p>'But it is expensive,' said the cautious publican.</p>

<p>'Oh, bah! What do you call it? Damn the expense!'</p>

<p>Bidding the scientist wait on the verandah the publican
retired, and after some delay reappeared with a bucket about half
full of an evil-smelling fluid. After an exchange of golden coin,
the two went off in the direction of the black's camp.</p>

<p>When in sight of it the publican, after warning his guest
again and again that the strictest secrecy must be observed,
returned home.</p>

<p>The German went alone to the camp. He found two old
blackfellows still awake; they had managed to conceal a small
quantity of the rum, and were amiably finishing it. It was with
some difficulty that any understanding was arrived at, but at
last he made his meaning plain, and was taken to the recumbent
form of Timothy. He found to his disgust that he was still
alive.</p>

<p>He felt his pulse; it was feeble and uneven. The man was in a
state of collapse, he concluded, and on the point of death. He
measured him and found, that although not quite up to
description, he was still an abnormally developed savage. A
bargain was then struck that as soon as Timothy died, his head
was to be cut off and secretly conveyed to the German.</p>

<p>The scientist returned, stepped noiselessly on to the
verandah and seated himself on a canvas chair to await results.
Tired out by his long coach journey and late vigil he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on his shoulder and he woke with a start. He
was a man of nerve, and had camped alone among New Guinea
cannibals, but he could not repress a shudder at what he saw. In
the west a full moon was sinking to rest. Dim and yellow in the
murky atmosphere of the sultry summer night, she emitted but a
weird and uncanny light, throwing long shadows across the level
country. On either side of him stood two gaunt, black naked
figures, and one held in its hand a ghastly, severed human head,
from which the blood still dripped.</p>

<p>The start was but momentary. The scientific side of his
character at once reasserted itself, and he arose, and taking
Timothy's head, paid the reward, and the two lean shadows faded
into the deeper shade. Timothy's cobbra was plunged into the
fiery bath, waiting for it. It was concealed in safety, and the
professor retired to enjoy a well-earned rest.</p>

<p>Now when he left the camp the two old men decided to represent
providence. Timothy was anything but a favorite; in fact he was a
nuisance. The white man said that he would surely die; what was
the good of waiting? They did not wait; Timothy was soon a corpse
in dead earnest, and the two men on their way to the German
professor with his head.</p>

<p>Big Bill awoke the next morning with a parched roof to his
mouth and a baked tongue. The kindly sergeant had left him a
waterbag, which he soon emptied, and before he faced the bench
some friendly visitors had revived his spirits&mdash;with
well-intentioned nips.</p>

<p>Discipline was lax out west in those days. Bill was a favorite
with everybody when sober. The magistrate and two Js.P. came to
the conclusion that the affair was accidental, and that a fine
and a caution would meet the case. The C.P.S., however, who was
learned in the law, pointed out to them that the accused, on the
evidence, must be committed for trial for manslaughter. The bench
was about reluctantly to consent when the astounding news was
brought into court that the corpse was now minus a head.</p>

<p>Bill was remanded while the police instituted a search, for
the missing article. Gradually, of course, the story leaked out,
one giving the other away. Bill seemed now the only innocent man
of the crowd. Timothy's return to life and his appreciation the
fact by at once sending for a bottle of rum was fully proved. It
was an awful knot to unravel. There were now, beside the actual
murderers, no less than six accessories, to the crime.</p>

<p>First, Bill commenced it by kicking Timothy insensible. Then
the gins in getting the rum, which caused the second, and fatal
stupor, helped and assisted. Next, the genial Irishman, still
very drunk, had a hand in it by giving them the rum, which
otherwise they would not have obtained. Of course the publican
who supplied the spirits was an accessory before the fact; the
scientist was the instigator of the deed; and then there were the
two confessed murderers.</p>

<p>It was gravely debated whether the chemist and the doctor
could not be included, the one for pronouncing Timothy dead; and
the other for being drunk when his services were required.</p>

<p>The excitement was intense. The professor threatened the
vengeance of the Emperor of all the Germans not to mention the
scientific societies of Europe if his liberty was interfered
with. The Irishman offered to fight everybody in the township if
a hand was laid upon him, and the publican threatened to bring an
action for libel against all and sundry who said that he sold
methylated spirits.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Judge was on circuit, and soon arrived. The
jury, after bringing in a verdict that the deceased died by
accident caused by the visitation of God, and that no one was
responsible, which the judge refused to accept; acquitted all the
accused.</p>

<p>The German promised the direst of actions by law unless he got
back his property for which he had duly paid, namely, Timothy's
head; and he got it.</p>

<p>Now, if anyone mentions methylated spirits within the hearing
of that publican there will probably be another trial for murder
put on record.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. &mdash; IN THE LAP OF DELILAH</h2>

<h3><i>The Australasian</i>, Melbourne, 11 Feb 1893</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
EVERYBODY liked Fred Birdell. He was such a willing, cheerful,
good-looking youngster. Everybody with one or two exceptions,
prophesied that he was bound to get on, he had such a happy knack
of making friends. The few exceptions remarked that this was the
very thing likely to be his downfall; a generous temper and
facile, friendly disposition not being usually conducive worldly
success. However, when he was getting his "colonial experience"
in the days of Northern Queensland he was the most, popular young
fellow in the district. Fred picked up the run of station life
rapidly, and by the time he had been over two years on an outside
cattle run he was worth his wages anywhere.</p>

<p>He had in him till the makings of true bushman. Without being
able analyse his feelings, he felt the many things which to other
men were only a wearisome sameness, were to him a pleasure and
delight.</p>

<p>When others crept sluggishly, grumbling, from their blankets,
Fred felt the early freshness of the jocund morn as a direct
call, and would be out for a plunge in the long lagoon and
through the dewy grass of the paddock with the black boys after
the horses, chanting a corroboree with them, or teaching them to
sing some jingling nigger chorus.</p>

<p>The Never-Never country, not yet far beyond the station
boundary, held untold possibilities for his young imagination.
What reefs of gold, what miles of beautiful country, what strange
discoveries might not be awaiting the first adventurer to those
regions? The romance of bush life was visible to him where so man
see only the monotony of the work and the hardship and occasional
privation. So it was a happy, careless existence he passed during
his novitiate, and the end of it found him as healthy, active a
specimen of humanity as could be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for the girls, Fred, when you go to town," the
fellows used to say chaffingly to him. But Fred never thought of
girls at that time. There were only two or three withered
specimens of womanhood in the district, and although a boy's
first love is generally for someone of mature age, the ladies in
question would scarcely under any circumstances have stirred even
the depth of a boy's heart.</p>

<p>And so it came about, that Fred decided to go on a visit to
his people in the South. He was a fairly innocent lad, but not
outrageously so. The stunted generation growing up in our modern
Australian cities possesses more vicious knowledge at fourteen
than he did at his twenty years, but for all that he was not a
country bumpkin. In those days there were no railways to transmit
one as by a conjuring trick from the solitude of the west to the
"big smoke" of eastern seaboard towns. People now would make
their will and bid a weeping adieu to their friends if required
to face such a journey as a jaunt to town then entailed.</p>

<p>From the open downs of the inland streams&mdash;streams in
reality at times&mdash;streams but in the name only for many,
many months&mdash;adown the low rise that there form the main
watershed, through the melancholy brigalow scrubs of the head
coastal waters, and down the coastal range itself, Fred and a
companion made their way to what was then the principal town in
Queensland, north of Brisbane. After over two years silent
consecutively on one station, even a very primitive township has
a certain charm of novelty about it to a young, unjaded taste.
True, there was little diversion beyond tho many nourishing bars,
and like most bush lads, Fred had enough innate vitality not to
feel any craving for artificial stimulant. To his ignorant palate
the flavour of such compounds was actually distasteful. A
blackfellow is the only human being who takes to rum
naturally.</p>

<p>There was no steamer going south for nearly a fortnight, and
Fred and his companion, a much older man, were necessarily
detained until then, At the end of three days Fred had made two
discoveries; first, that champagne was a most delightful drink,
which could be imbibed without any involuntary shuddering;
secondly that a certain young damsel's eyes were deeper and more
unfathomable than any still bush lagoon sleeping 'midst a fringe
of broad leaved lilies.</p>

<p>Poor lad, the unconscious idealism of his nature made him
taste nothing but spiritual elation in a very inferior imitation
of champagne, and see a dream-woman in a third-class bar-maid
with a pair of fine eyes.</p>

<p>His friend rallied him find tried to divert his thoughts into
other channels when the steamer was about due, but not being very
earnest himself he did not make sufficient allowance for the
depth of a fresh young nature; otherwise he would have got him on
board and carried him south by force or fraud. The steamer came
and left, but Fred remained.</p>

<p>A cheque, even if it has taken over two years to earn, does
not last very long under such circumstances, and Birdell was at
the end of his almost before he realised the fact. He awoke one
morning with the same sort of feeling he experienced wire when he
went to sleep on watch, and let the cattle go off the camp.</p>

<p>Further consideration assured him that there was no doubt
about. He felt ashamed to go home after his long delay, and
equally ashamed to return to the station without having gone
home. He had a pound or two left after paying his hotel bill, and
two good horses in a paddock outside town. He could sell the
horses and go south, or he could saddle up and go back to the
station. He felt disinclined to do either. Delilah had assured
him that he was the only one who had ever really sympathised will
her, and he was far too young to be able to break away from her
by him self. He had learnt to take his liquor when it was pretty
well disguised, so he got up and had some rum and milk
well-sweetened.</p>

<p>Delilah was seldom visible before 10 o'clock, and when he put
in an appearance some time after that hour she was too deeply
engrossed with another man to take much notice of him. How could
he imagine that she knew as well as he did that he had reached
the end of his tether? Up to that morning he had believed her to
be all artlessness and innocence: a jewel amid unworthy
surroundings. The studied neglect frightened him at first: he
thought lie had done something to offend her. Ere the afternoon
was over even his guileless eyes were opened, his day was done,
he was only a foolish bushman at the end of his cheque, and
Delilah had no more use for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps, to a trustful lad, there is nothing so morally
agonising as the discovery that there are really bad women in the
world, and worse, that he has been made the sport of one of them.
Fred's answer against the deceiver was swallowed up in contempt
for himself. It seemed to him that everyone must be sneering at
him; and he had never known anything but friendliness all his
life.</p>

<p>No; he could not go back to stand the good humoured chaff of
his old companions out west. Nor could he face his own people at
home. His nature was as sensitive as a girl's, and the touch of a
woman's tainted hand had made every nerve quiver. As he walked
moodily by the bank of the river a whiff of fresh salt air came
up from the distant sea. It did him good; it seemed to chase the
fumes of the bar-room from his brain. The old longing for the
unknown country, the outside life, the charm of the hush, was
strong upon him at once. He looked at the hard straight streets,
the ugly uniformity of wood and iron structures bounding them,
and his soul loathed the place. He would go back to his old life
at once.</p>

<p>But not to the old station. No, he must be amongst strangers
awhile. Men were pushing out north and north-west. He would go
with them. Wherever there were horses to ride or cattle to look
after he was sure of work. A day's ride would take him on the
main road to the north, where he knew stock was constantly on the
move. Once among the familiar scenes and duties again, these few
mad weeks would seem like some foolish dream. Nature, the kindly
mother who never deceives, held out her hand to him, and he took
it gratefully.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">"CAW! Caw!"</p>

<p>A black crow pulls up abruptly in its flight, and dropping its
legs after the awkward manner of its kind, perches on a dead
bough.</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw! Caw-r-r-r;" another bird joins it, and the notes of
the two die away in a hoarse chorus.</p>

<p>The ashes of a fire and the marks of a late encampment are
beneath them. For a crow this holds out as great an attraction as
burnt feed for a horse. The two birds look cautiously round and
exchange a low guttural remarks in the knowing way peculiar to
them, which has caused the natives to believe them gifted with
the power of talking to each other. Satisfied that there is no
one in sight, and that the place is deserted, they flutter to the
ground and commence prospecting for scraps. They have it all to
themselves for some time, occasionally diversifying matters by a
flapping light over a choice bit of fat. Presently they are
disturbed, and with an angry "caw!" fly back to the bough.</p>

<p>A dingo puts in an appearance, and begins sniffing about on a
like quest; apparently he is more deeply interested than the
crows, for he commences scratching on the ground in one
particular place, and gives vent to a short howl. A second joins
him, and the two root vigorously, the disgusted crows watching
the proceeding from above. Shortly the dogs have unearthed
something which has all the appearance of a man's boot, and are
snapping and snarling over it.</p>

<p>A quick sharp report! One dog bounds away, the other gives a
savage yelp and falls over; the crows fly off loudly expressing
disapproval.</p>

<p>"Hit him?" says a man sitting on a horse and holding another
by the bridle, to a man on foot, who is just ejecting a cartridge
shell from his rifle.</p>

<p>"One of them; they must have been busy not to have heard us
coming. Wonder what they were delving after?"</p>

<p>The first speaker dismounts, and hitching the horses to a
tree, the two approach the deserted camp.</p>

<p>"Looks as though there had been a funeral here. It's a man's
boot at any rate."</p>

<p>"And a foot inside of it," returns his mate.</p>

<p>"Poor devil, they might hare buried him a little deeper."</p>

<p>"Wonder who it is? Tracks appear fresh."</p>

<p>"Yesterday's camp: but there's no telling to an hour or so
this dry weather."</p>

<p>The two men look curiously about, stamp the disturbed earth
down, and drag some dead limbs over the place, then, after the
habit of bushmen, proceed to cut up tobacco for their pipes. One
of them turns the dead dingo over.</p>

<p>"Those Martini bullets hit hard; its gone clean through him,"
he remarks.</p>

<p>"What do you say if we ride round by Brumby Jack's, and find
out something about this?" says his companion. "You, Dick, as a
newly fledged J.P. ought not to allow corpses to be dropped
promiscuously about the run."</p>

<p>"Right. Brumby's on his good behaviour with me just now."</p>

<p>They light their pipes, mount, and ride away. The dead man,
under a foot of loose earth, and the dead dog, under none at all,
are left in possession. Not much difference in their burial after
all.</p>

<p>It is on the bank of the river, a bare-looking river, thinly
timbered, running through great sloping downs stretching away to
the sky line on either side in unbroken monotony.</p>

<p>Two hours' ride brings the men to a comfortless-looking
shanty. Partly mud walls rudely thatched, partly galvanised iron,
bent and patched as though the sheets had been used many times.
The tread of the horses brings a dirty man into the apology for a
verandah. This is Brumby Jack, the keeper of the accommodation
house, save the mark. Needless to say, he is not licensed to sell
fermented and spirituous liquors, but lives upon the business
all the same.</p>

<p>The two men dismount and fasten their horses to a rude
post.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Kelson," says Brumby Jack effusively, "I was
just thinking of riding over to see you, but I haven't a soul to
leave to look after the place."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" replies the man that shot the
dog.</p>

<p>"Well, there were some men left here this morning, and at
their last camp, about eight miles from here, one of their mates
died, and they left his things with me."</p>

<p>"Who buried him?"</p>

<p>"They did themselves. They are on their way to Burketown."</p>

<p>"Hum! He's getting up again; he had one foot out when he
passed."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" And Jack's villainous face assumed an air
of horrified sympathy with the defunct.</p>

<p>"What did they say ho died of?" inquired tho other man, who
had been rinsing his mouth out with cold water from a bag hanging
in the verandah.</p>

<p>"Fever; he'd been bad ever since they crossed the
Burdekin."</p>

<p>"Do not want me to take charge of his dunnage?" inquired
Kelson.</p>

<p>Brumby shrugged his shoulders. "Beyond some letters and papers
there's nothing but a pair of blankets and some old clothes."</p>

<p>"Any money?"</p>

<p>"They didn't leave me any."</p>

<p>"Well, as we are here, we may as well have a bite to eat. Have
you got any case liquor not uncorked?"</p>

<p>Jack smiled virtuously, as if to say "You must have your
little joke," and led the way into a rude apartment, which served
as a living-room. Leaving his guests there, he presently
reappeared with a bottle of whisky and a corkscrew, which he
rather ostentatiously placed before Kelson; then he went out
again and came back with some letters and other miscellaneous
articles.</p>

<p>"This is all, barring the duds," he said.</p>

<p>After uncorking the whisky and helping themselves, the two
examined the dead man's effects. Both were silent for some
time.</p>

<p>"Look here, Dick," said Hyndes. He held out a photograph to
him.</p>

<p>The other took it and looked at it.</p>

<p>"Fine old lady; mother, I suppose. Poor beggar! A gentleman,
seemingly." He looked again at the letter he had been reading,
and a vision of the unmarked, shallow grave, with the wild dogs
tearing at it, seemed to float before his eyes as he read the
loving words a mother had written to her absent son.</p>

<p>"I have his name, and his mother's address," he said almost
roughly to his friend. "Don't read any more; I'll send all these
things on, and write to her as best I can."</p>

<p>Hyndes nodded and gave him back what he held in his hand.
"There's another photo there," he said.</p>

<p>Kelson looked at it, and then at his, companion; both were men
of the world, and the unspoken question was silently answered in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he said; "I won't send her that." And the pictured
semblance of Delilah was thrown in torn fragments on the begrimed
floor of the shanty.</p>

<p>"He had some horses, I suppose?" he asked, when Brumby
returned with the coarse materials for a meal.</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but, of course, they took them on with
them."</p>

<p>"Do you know the men?"</p>

<p>"No. All strangers up this way."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll send down from the station, and have him buried
properly."</p>

<p>"I'd do it myself, willing," said Brumby; "but there, I
haven't a soul about the place."</p>

<p>The repetition of this remark was quite unnecessary, as nobody
ever credited Brumby with having a soul.</p>

<p>The wide acres of Carpentaria saw the last white man leave
them in disgust, and the country abandoned to the former
inhabitants. Then new men with new hopes came and restocked the
deserted runs. Kelson and Hyndes had retired from the unequal
struggle against the depression of that time. Brumby Jack, after
clearing out the pockets of the last traveller, left with a
moderate competence; and only a few distorted shoots of iron told
of the site of his palatial abode. The rank grass of a wet season
grew unchecked over the grave of those who fell by the way-side
during the early years; and the bush fire following in the dry
time destroyed any rough fence which may have marked a white
man's resting-place.</p>

<p>The wind might remember the spot where the fair-faced boy
slept, but everyone else has long since forgotten.</p>

<p><br>
IN ONE of the cemeteries of Sydney, wherein many of her best
men are buried, it is curious to note some of the records placed
above meaner men. Here lies one whose wife obtained a divorce
from him on account of his cruelty, and his children rise up and
curse him to this day; but in gilded letters on the white marble
we read, that "of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>Here is another whose last years were passed in an alcoholic,
bestial dream, but the story says that his sorrowing widow
erected the monument in affectionate remembrance of his many
virtues.</p>

<p>Look out across the blue sea.</p>

<p>Which is best? To sleep for ever with the waves of the
restless Pacific rolling above&mdash;to rest unmarked and unknown
in the quiet bush with the cattle browsing overhead&mdash;or, to
be buried with a sculptured lie weighing you down? Alter all, it
is only so many different ways of writing <i>finis</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. &mdash; A WRECKED FORTUNE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 19 Sep 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'I NEVER cared much for that part of the a country that I told
you about, where Mrs. Birrell's farm was; I never seemed to have
any luck there. I lost a fortune there,' remarked Jim.</p>

<p>'Jolly lucky to have ever had one to lose.'</p>

<p>'Well, I never did exactly have it, but I made sure I was
going to get it.'</p>

<p>'Oh! that kind of fortune&mdash;one in prospect. Heaps of
those knocking about I've lost whips of them myself.'</p>

<p>'It was all through that blamed Wreck. I told you that he got
a remittance out, and married Eliza. Well, the girl had some
savvy, for she got her paws on what few pounds were left, and, by
Jove, she stuck to 'em. Wouldn't give the Wreck the price of a
drink, no matter how he begged and prayed for it.</p>

<p>'One day the Wreck turned up at my camp, and pretty shaky he
was. I took pity on him to the extent of a nip, and then he
commenced to cry, and said I was the only friend he had in the
world, and he intended to make my fortune. I suggested that he'd
better make his own first, but he assured me that it was all
right; hung round for a bit, spelling for another nip, which I
gave him at last and he departed, still sticking to it that there
was a fortune hanging out.</p>

<p>'About a week after that who should turn up but Eliza; and she
wanted to know what I had done with her husband. Said he'd been
last seen at my camp, and if I didn't produce him sound in wind
and limb, she'd know the reason why.</p>

<p>'I managed to get her to tell me when her husband had
disappeared, and I found out that he had not been seen since he
had been mooning round my camp talking about this fortune. Eliza
had got hold of the fortune yam, and she concluded that I had
either murdered him for the sake of the fortune or had him kept
hidden somewhere until he produced it. I asked her if she knew
what the fortune was like, and could swear to its brand and
ear-mark, but she got very wild; and when I inquired if she had
the fortune's photograph she flung off in a rage, and vowed
vengeance. She put all manner of yarns about concerning me, but
of course, people only laughed at her, and came to the conclusion
that the Wreck had had enough of married life, and had cleared
out But he hadn't, for he turned up at my camp again, a more
dilapidated wreck than ever. He'd been in the range, and what
with leeches, scrub ticks, mosquitoes, lawyer vines, and tumbling
over precipices five hundred feet high (at least, he said he
had), there was very little more than half of him left.</p>

<p>'I fed him up, told him that he was looked upon as dead, and
that the populace was only waiting for his body to come forward
to give him a public funeral; that his disconsolate widow was
also waiting for the corpse, as she had received several offers
of marriage, and was in a hurry. After I had comforted him with
these yarns he seemed happier, said that the fortune was all
right; he'd been away looking at it, and it was still there.</p>

<p>'Of course, I had put it down as all talk, but he was so
confident that I thought there might be something in it, for
queer things like this have happened. At last he produced a
packet and, opening it, showed me some strange-looking stuff like
smoke-colored crystals, all alike, with eight sides and a pointed
end.</p>

<p>'"What's that?" he said, triumphantly.</p>

<p>'I said I was blest if knew.</p>

<p>'"That's tin," he said; "tin ore of the very best quality,
averages 95 per cent at the very least."</p>

<p>'There was great talk about tin at that time, for there was a
big field over the range across the Queensland border, and
everybody was a little bitten.</p>

<p>'"Where did you get it?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"Well, I don't mind telling you; I've just been out there,
and I'll show you where it is. Fortune, my boy! there's a hundred
fortunes out there. Hundred thousand pounds every one of
them."</p>

<p>'Of course, I did not set much store by this talk, but still
he might have stumbled on something.</p>

<p>'I managed to impress on man the necessity of not talking so
much, and he promised he would hold his tongue, and left the
packet of specimens with me. Of course, he went bragging about it
and got so wonderfully drunk on the strength of it that he quite
forgot that he had left the specimens with me. Meantime I took
them to a man who understood the matter, and he tested them, and
said it was right enough, that it was very rich tin ore, but he
didn't believe that they came from anywhere about there; he said
the geological formation was against it; still he would not speak
for certain, used a lot of big words, and said something about an
upheaval. I assured him that if the Wreck could not take us to
the place there certainly would be an upheaval&mdash;an upheaval
of wreckage. The question now was to get the Wreck sufficiently
sober to take some of us out there. Of course it would be a grand
thing for the town and everybody was interested, and the Wreck's
popularity ascended at a bound, and a list was started to get him
a testimonial, while town lots went up flying.</p>

<p>'I had an awful job to keep the Wreck up to the mark, but he
stuck to his story like grim death, and made me believe in it. I
used to lay awake at night speculating what I'd do with all the
money when it came rolling in. As for Eliza, I believe she
started credit at all the stores, and began to talk of ancestral
homes in England, and how she'd be presented at Court; and I
think she ran a duke in as a family relation before she'd
done.</p>

<p>'At last I got the Wreck steady enough to go, and four of us
started with him as delegates, or something of that sort. There
was the scientific man I had taken the specimens to, the
principal publican, and the principal Storekeeper. It was a
picnic, you bet. Such a devil's dance he led us, through scrub
and jungle, and along sidings, and up ravines and down gullies,
until there was talk of lynching him if that tin field didn't
soon put in an appearance.</p>

<p>'The Wreck was very nervous, I noticed, and I began to smell a
rat, but I didn't say anything just then. At last we were camped
right at the foot of a long spur, and after we'd fixed things up,
the Wreck asked me to come to the top of the ridge with him and
have a look over, as he had an idea that we were close to the
place. I had an idea there was no place; and as soon as we got
out of bearing I remarked: "How the devil are you going to
get out of this mess?"</p>

<p>'The Wreck trembled all over. "Where's your blooming tin
field?" I asked.</p>

<p>'He shook his head dolefully; so I took him by the collar, and
shook his body to keep it company. "Out with it, where did you
get those specimens from?"</p>

<p>'"Damph&mdash;I&mdash;know!" he chattered.</p>

<p>'"Confound you! How did you come to play this trick on me, of
all men?"</p>

<p>'"Damph&mdash;I&mdash;know!" was all I could shake out of
him.</p>

<p>'Now, this was a nice fix, but I felt more wild with myself
than with the Wreck. That I should nave been such a fool as to be
taken in by him!</p>

<p>'"Jim," he said, at last, "can't you fix it up somehow? I'll
be hanged when I get back," and he commenced to whimper.</p>

<p>'"You've got a cheek! After leading me this chase through all
this jungle and stones, you want me to help you out! Where did
you get those specimens?"</p>

<p>'"You know old. Foster who has the shanty at the foot of the
range. He had them&mdash;has had them for years. Some fellow who
died there in the horrors brought them over from West Australia.
He put me up to this game."</p>

<p>'"Then the best thing you can do is to split on him."</p>

<p>'"O Lord! I haven't the nerve. He'd stick a knife in me."</p>

<p>'"And the others'll hang you, so you've got your choice."</p>

<p>'"Have you got those specimens with you, Jim?"</p>

<p>'"Yes," I said; "here they are. I'm not going to West
Australia at present."</p>

<p>'"I must think of something; leave me to my misery in case
nothing turns up," and he sat down on a rock, borrowed a pipe of
tobacco, and I left him.</p>

<p>'Now, you'd think that drunken fool had got himself into as
tight a place as any man could, and no nerves left to face it out
with, but I'm blest if he didn't wriggle out of it.</p>

<p>'It was dark, nearly, when I got back to camp, and the others
wanted to know what I'd done with the Wreck; but I said we had
parted, and I didn't know what had come of him. He never turned
up all night, and the next morning we decided to go back, for you
may be sure we were all dog-sick of it. I proposed looking for
the Wreck for form's sake, but they said, "Oh, let him slide,"
and we started for home.</p>

<p>'Now, we'd been twisting and turning about so much that I was
not a bit surprised when we came out on the road in about three
miles, for, of course, the Wreck had been wandering around anyhow
to gain time. Foster's shanty was only a mile away, so we agreed
to go back there and refresh ourselves with something, for the
old man knew me too well not to give us good stuff. Blessed if we
hadn't played right into the Wreck's hands. There he was with
half a dozen stiff nips under his belt as big as bull beef. The
wastrel had made straight in there when I left him, and told old
Foster that everything was running on greased ways. He'd meant to
come back to our camp in the morning, but we had saved him that
trouble.</p>

<p>'"Well, now we're right," he said, complacently, as we came
in.</p>

<p>'We looked at him, nothing more, and old Foster put his thick
tumblers on the bar, and asked us to "give it a name." I looked
at Foster very hard, and he went to the back and brought a bottle
out of a case. None of us asked the Wreck if he had a mouth on
him, so he helped himself without being asked, and, strange to
say, Foster saw him pour out half a tumbler without a murmur.
Then I dropped that there was some villainy on between the
two.</p>

<p>'"You see, we were a little too late," remarked the Wreck, as
he put down his tumbler with a gasp.</p>

<p>'"Too late! How do you mean?" asked the scientific man.</p>

<p>'"Why, my friend, Mr. Foster, has already secured the ground.
I forgot to inform you that Mr. Foster is also aware of the rich
find."</p>

<p>'Old Foster beamed complacently, and remarked, "That's so,
gents."</p>

<p>'"But where is the bally place, after all?" said two or three
at once.</p>

<p>'Old Foster beamed still more. "That I don't care about
saying," he returned. "Not just now. Here's some more of the
stuff," and going into the back room he returned with what, I
presume, was the balance of the ore left by the defunct soaker
from West Australia. While the others were examining it I got a
grip on the Wreck and ran him into the verandah.</p>

<p>'"I'm going to belt the life out of you with my bullock whip
when we get back," I remarked to cheer him up.</p>

<p>'"Honor bright Jim! I didn't know what I was saying last
night. It's all right, right as rain. I was only a bit off my
chump through wandering around so long, and getting bushed."</p>

<p>'"Then you mean to have the cast-iron cheek to tell me that
there's still a tin field knocking about here?"</p>

<p>'"I do, Jim; it's solid truth; only I'm in old Foster's hands,
and must do what he says."</p>

<p>'"And the West Australian man who died here in the
horrors?"</p>

<p>'"Did I say anything about a West Australian man? Must have
been clean off my head with worry. No fear, the stuff came from
here right enough."</p>

<p>I shook him up a bit and went inside. That cunning old Foster
with his oily tongue had got completely round those fellows. He
was just piling it on to the Wreck, running him down all he could
think of; saying what a fool he'd been to trust to a fellow who
couldn't keep his mouth shut tight enough to keep the flies out,
and generally holding him up to public ridicule.</p>

<p>'Then he commenced on the field, and what it would do for the
district, and I'm hanged if those fools didn't still believe in
it all. You've only got to promise a man enough to make him
believe.</p>

<p>'However, to make a long story short, old Foster got up enough
excitement about the matter to sell his place well, and, as you
may imagine, he and the Wreck and Eliza skipped without ever
pointing out that tin field.</p>

<p><br>
'I CAME across the Wreck once afterwards, at a small pub out
back, when I was carrying. Foster and Eliza were there
too&mdash;they ran the Show. The Wreck peeled potatoes and washed
up and nursed the baby; and Eliza generally rattled him round,
and allowed him two nips a day. He wanted badly to run away and
go with me, but I was not agreeable.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>8. &mdash; THE PEAK OF LOST DREAMS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 19 Dec 1896</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE short tropic twilight was at an end; 'at one stride came
the dark;' darkness and silence both.</p>

<p>The lonely man on the great interior plain felt as though he
were at sea on a windless night of calm and heat, for in the sky
unflecked by clouds the stars shone clear and bright down to the
very verge of the horizon. But here there was no creak and rattle
of masts and cordage, no sullen roll by which, even in its
deepest dreams, the ocean mutters of its might and power.</p>

<p>Such silence is crushing to the spirit; one seems to have
outlived the bustle, of the world, to have touched on the 'shores
where all was dumb,' or to be astray, lost on some new, fire-born
planet, doomed, to await through long years, companionless and in
darkness, the coming of light and gladsome human voices.</p>

<p>Strange phantoms gather round at such times, strange faces
come and go, strange eyes shine for a moment out of the
surrounding obscurity, then vanish, and strange hands touch our
own lightly and softly. Through the night, broken by restless
snatches of sleep, full of troubled dreams, the solitary man lay
on the rough soil of the great plain, his head pillowed on his
saddle, glad when the snort of one of his horses, or the clink of
their hobble chains, broke the dead stillness.</p>

<p>At last, after many vain and longing looks, the low-lying
stars in the east began to wax faint in the grey gleam of dawn
that, even with the sultry sigh of the coming hot wind stealing
across the plain, looked cold and chill, until only the most
brilliant of the southern constellations awaited the
quick-spreading flush of the conquering sun.</p>

<p>At the earliest indication of day the traveller stood erect,
eagerly scanning the western horizon as the light grew and the
visible bounds of the great plain came in sight. But the watcher
saw more. Silhouetted in dark bluish-grey against the morning sky
there appeared the fantastic semblance of a line of rugged,
broken hills, dominated by one tall peak in the centre. Plainer
and more distinct it grew until, clear and undeniable, there
stood out a far distant range, visible from that point only
during the brief interval between dawn and sunrise.</p>

<p>The traveller drew his compass from his pouch, and carefully
took the bearing of the central mount towering above its fellows;
then behind him the great red sun suddenly sprang up, the range
faded and disappeared from view, only the man's lengthened shadow
fell dark upon the plain, pointing in the direction where it had
appeared.</p>

<p>'I have seen it,' he said, speaking to himself, as men will in
solitude: 'It is no dream.'</p>

<p>He took up bridle and halter, caught his horses, and was soon
returning on his tracks of the day before, leading to his late
resting-place.</p>

<p><br>
MONTALBA DOWNS was the furthest western station in those days
of Queensland settlement. Beyond lay the unknown, the mysterious
interior, waiting for the adventurous foot of the white man. But
the plains, broken by belts of scrub, rich as they were in grass
and herbage, were waterless. Over the soft, spongy, untrodden
soil the most tireless horse grew faint and weary. At night
around the fire, in hut and camp, strange stories were told of
what lay beyond&mdash;romances gathered from the broken babble of
the natives who hung about the station.</p>

<p>Could one but travel for many days, a boundless plain would be
reached stretching away, away to where the sun set. There, beyond
that plain, which none could ever pass&mdash;for when the rains
fell in their season the surface was too soft and boggy to ride
over, and when the ground dried the shallow pools of surface
water dried up too&mdash;there was a range of fear. No natives
lived or hunted there; for at night, the earth moaned and
trembled in spasms of unrest, water burst forth and ran down the
gullies&mdash;water that could not bear the sunlight, for in the
daytime it shrank; and dwindled away into the thirsty sand. Rocks
and boulders rolled, down the steep sides of the range, dislodged
without seeming cause, and the rush and roar of their headlong
plunge awoke loud echoes that filled the ravines and gorges, with
mocking cries uttered by no human lips. The trees growing on this
range were gnarled and; twisted, many of them smitten and blasted
by lightning.</p>

<p>Such were some of the wild tales told of the silent waste
under the setting sun&mdash;told often in seeming jest, but with
a lurking vein of half-belief running throughout. The better
educated owners of the place looked upon it merely as a dry belt
of country that, in time would be crossed when the pressure of
increasing settlement drove men to push further out; but even
they felt a haunting sense of mystery about it when they
conjectured what basis of truth might underlie these idle
legends.</p>

<p><br>
ONE day three strange natives came into the camp of quiet
blacks at the station. They were shy, and kept apart, although
the others were friendly to them; when one of the whites
approached the camp they slunk away. The other blacks could talk
to them a little, and told the whites that these men came from
the unknown west, that they had been on a long hunting trip, and
the water had dried up behind them, cutting off their return.
When the thunder storms fell, they would go back; till then they
would remain quietly in the camp. Gradually the newcomers grew
bolder, and were communicative. Some of their tribe had seen the
range and told of the peak that rose, 'tall fellow' as their
interpreters put it, but their own country was to the north; no
blacks lived at the range.</p>

<p>In time the clouds gathered and the storms brooded black over
the station, breaking in wind and dust with a few fierce peals of
thunder, and heavy splashing drops. At last to the westwards a
black bank received the sinking sun, and through the dark hours
of early night the lightning drew zigzag strokes of livid flame
across the gloom. In the morning the alien natives had
departed.</p>

<p>'Bother take them,' said Drew, the younger of the two
partners, 'I wanted them to show me where the water is that they
are making for.'</p>

<p>'It will only be some melon-hole in one of the belts of scrub.
We may find out from our own niggers where it is; perhaps these
strangers may have told them,' replied his partner.</p>

<p>This conjecture turned out to be right. One of the blacks
professed, after the manner of his kind, to have a complete
knowledge of it; in fact, his speech suggested that it had been
his childhood's happy playground. Both men knew how much discount
to allow on this kind of talk; but as Murri-Arpa, the black in
question, could ride a little and was willing to go there, Drew
started out with him the next morning to locate the place and
find out how much water there was there. They arrived at their
destination, which proved to be but a larger depression in the
scrub than was usually found, and camped there for the night. The
three blacks were still there resting, for, as they explained
through the medium of Murri-Arpa, they had a long stage before
them the next day.</p>

<p>Drew fed the wanderers, and Murri-Arpa questioned them about
the range. They told a strange tale, if his version was
correct.</p>

<p>There was a great plain to the west; from that plain, just
before the sun 'jumped up,' the range could be seen, only then.
They had not seen it, although they had crossed the plain, but
that was in the day time. They did not want to see it. Questioned
why, they replied that the range had a strange power. Whoever
looked on it felt bound to search for it, to go to it, but none
ever found it. Men of their tribe had seen the range and fallen
under its influence. They had started to look for it, but no man
had returned. There was barren, desert country to cross, no game,
no water, only spinifex and thorny scrub, and through this the
crazed men wandered on until they fell and died, but never saw
the range and the lofty peak. Only from the great plain before
the sun rose had it ever been seen. How did they know all this if
the searchers never returned to tell their tales? They could not
say. The old men of the tribe had told them, and they believed
what the old men said.</p>

<p>This was the story Murri-Arpa repeated word by word to Drew in
the quaint descriptive speech of the native. How far was it to
the great plain where the range could be seen? They would pass it
the next afternoon. Drew made up his mind to go with them,
leaving Murri-Arpa at the water to await his return. He had
brought water-bags on the pack-horse, and they travelled along
cheerily the following morning, the blacks seemingly encouraged
by his presence, and especially by the presence of the
water-bags.</p>

<p>Noon passed, and Drew fed his guides. Soon after starting
again they emerged on the great plain, as they simultaneously
called out to him. Gradually as they progressed the belt of Gidya
scrub behind them dwindled down to a dark line, then broke up
into clumps and dots, which first began to quiver and tremble in
the wave of heated air hovering over the plain, and then became
merged in the deceitful haze that now bounded them on all sides.
At about 4 o'clock the natives halted, and indicated by signs
that this was the place whence the range was visible.</p>

<p>How they knew it he could not make out, for there was no
landmark in sight, but he accepted the fact, and tried to induce
them to stay the night, showing them that he had food and water
for them. But they were not to be persuaded, so he filled their
wooden coolamen up with water, gave them a tomahawk he had
brought on purpose, and saw their naked figures disappear to the
north-west. Then he settled down to his long and lonely watch,
which was rewarded when daylight broke.</p>

<p>'Are you certain it was not a cloud bank?' asked his partner,
when they were discussing the matter after Drew's' return.</p>

<p>'Certain as I can be,' was the reply. 'See; I will draw it for
you,' and he rapidly sketched the outline of a range with one
taller peak in the centre.</p>

<p>'Let us go out to the plain together, and take that formidable
telescope of yours,' he continued.</p>

<p>'Will there be enough water left?'</p>

<p>'Yes, there is enough in the scrub for the next three or four
days for certain.'</p>

<p>'Very well, we will go to-morrow.'</p>

<p><br>
THORPE and Drew were old friends as well as partners; indeed;
in the future they were to, be united by a more sentimental bond
than a mere business one, for Thorpe was engaged to Drew's
sister. Only that the country was scarcely yet sufficiently
civilized to be a comfortable surroundings for a lady's
residence, they would have been married before.</p>

<p>Next morning, well supplied with fresh horses, they started
for the plain. Drew proposed that they should merely spell at the
water, for a few hours, then ride on through the night to the
plain, so as to obviate the long watch. They took the blackfellow
with them once more, to remain at the scrub hole with the spare
horses.</p>

<p>The most beautiful constellation in Austral skies, the
glittering belt of Orion, was overhead, and the much over-rated
Cross hung low to the west of south, as they pulled rein on the
spot which, judging by time, Drew thought to be on or nearly the
same place where he had passed the night.</p>

<p>Once more he waited for the paling of the stars, once more he
saw the mystic range stand out against the grey sky, and, with
hands that trembled in their eagerness, levelled the telescope,
and adjusted the focus. Then, without a word, handed it to his
companion. Thorpe gazed intently.</p>

<p>Certainly no cloud bank. Through the powerful glass, he could
see the dark shadowed ravines that scarred the sides of the
range, the serrated crests and the bold peak that soared aloft
like the monarch of the range. Suddenly a cry of admiration broke
from him, and quickly passed back the glass to his companion,
that he, too, might enjoy the glorious sight before it
vanished.</p>

<p>The summit of the peak had caught the first flash of the sun.
A crown of rosy gold burnt and flashed on the mountain's brow;
burnt, flashed, and sparkled for one brief instant, then, faded
into the nothingness of space. Drew closed the telescope. The
legends of the natives were no longer fables.</p>

<p>'I shall put my foot on that range or die,' he said
impetuously.</p>

<p>Thorpe sighed, and kept silence for some time, as he gazed
around.</p>

<p>'I wonder if the other yarn of the blacks is true, that this
range can only be seen from here.'</p>

<p>'We disbelieved the existence of the range once,' answered his
eager companion. 'It may be true. If so there is only one way to
account for it. This plain must be the summit of a watershed, and
much higher than we think; going west one would unconsciously
descend, as we have unconsciously ascended, and some higher ridge
would probably shut it from sight at the lower elevation.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so, but it is there, and one only has to go far
enough west to reach it.'</p>

<p>'But how is it we cannot see it now?'</p>

<p>'Oh! that is a common enough phenomenon. Don't you remember
when we were out run hunting, we saw a belt of scrub with a
peculiar gap in it, just after daylight, which it took us the
whole day to reach? It is due, I suppose, to some refractive
power in the atmosphere peculiar to this hour of the day.'</p>

<p>'How far do you think that range is from here?' Drew asked
wistfully, his eyes still fixed on the spot where it had
been.</p>

<p>'Impossible to say without knowing how high we are.'</p>

<p>And with one last lingering look they mounted and rode back to
the spot where the blackfellow awaited their return.</p>

<p>They had both now fallen under the spell, and made up their
minds to reach the range and peak. Thorpe had a brother, who had
just sold out of his station some 150 miles away to the eastward.
He wrote to him, asking him to come and look after Montalba Downs
for a month or so while he and Drew went out to inspect some new
country. Then they started to prepare for their journey, carting
a tank out one day's journey beyond the scrub hole, and then had
to wait for a friendly thunderstorm to fill the hole. Before the
rain fell Thorpe's brother arrived. A storm fell, the tank was
filled from the scrub hole, and the two adventurers started,
refusing, much to the brother's surprise, to take either another
white or a black boy with them.</p>

<p>After they had left the elder Thorpe learnt from the station
gossip of the romantic quest they were bent on, and naturally
characterised it as 'tommy rot'.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
'THE end of the plain at last!' cried Drew, as he pointed to
some dark spots ahead, which indicated the presence of trees. The
plain had seemed interminable, and both men felt relieved at the
idea of leaving it. The timber turned out to be the edge of a
straggling forest of box trees, as level as the plain they left.
Still, for aught they knew, they might be unconsciously
descending all the time. When it was near sundown Drew climbed
the tallest tree that was handy; but from it only saw a sea of
grey-green tree-tops.</p>

<p>That night they camped on a providential patch of
fresh-springing, burnt grass, which served to prevent the horses
straying. The monotony of the forest was broken by belts of
barren scrub during the next day's travel. In the afternoon they
were lucky enough to obtain water by digging in the dry, sandy
bed of a creek they crossed.</p>

<p>'What's this,' said Drew, as they were fixing their camp on
the bank. He touched with his foot a round, white object as he
spoke.</p>

<p>'A nigger's skull; and there's the rest of his bones,'
returned Thorpe.</p>

<p>'What the devil did he want to die here for?' demanded
Drew.</p>

<p>'I suppose because he couldn't help it. Anyhow he didn't know
we were going to camp here.'</p>

<p>'Well, he had plenty of other places to die in,' grumbled
Drew, with an injured air.</p>

<p>The night was still and calm, both men were tired, and
stretched themselves on their blankets, expecting the sound,
dreamless sleep of the weary; but it came not. Towards daybreak
they slept; but their sleep was broken by fantastic dreams, in
which the Peak always bore part. Now, with the black pall of a
thunderstorm behind it; anon shining out against the silvery-grey
sky of the morning, crested with a glory of golden splendor. It
was nearly sunrise ere they awoke, unrefreshed and out of
sorts.</p>

<p>'It's all the fault of that dead nigger,' said Drew. 'How
could anyone expect to sleep cheek by jowl alongside of his
bones?'</p>

<p>'Luckily he hasn't worried the horses,' replied Thorpe; 'they
look twenty per cent better than they did yesterday morning.'</p>

<p>It was bad travelling that day. Dense mulga scrub beset them,
belts of prickly undergrowth intersected their course, and the
baneful desert spinifex was ever around them. That night they had
to fasten the horses to trees to prevent them wandering, for
there was neither food nor water for them.</p>

<p>Next morning they came to a valley, sparsely weeded, the
ground covered with the cruel spinifex and the barren sandstone
rocks of the desert. The valley ran between black-browed frowning
hills, but at the bottom there was no sign of a watercourse. They
crossed it, ascended the rise, and once more found themselves
amongst the countless stems of the gloomy, mulga. In an hour or
two's time they were again in open country, and in the distance
they saw a dark black line, which turned out to be a wall of
basaltic boulders, a formidable barrier, impassable to their
horses.</p>

<p>They climbed the rugged, honeycombed sides of the highest
rock, but from the top could see nothing to the westward but a
field of broken rocks, the dead scoriae of some ancient eruption.
To the south, however, they noticed that the wall trended round
to the west, so descending and remounting they skirted the
obstacle in that direction. Suddenly Thorpe stepped, and held up
his hand.</p>

<p>Drew joined him, and he pointed to another skeleton lying
prone at the rocky base. This one was intact and untouched;
beside the bones' lay some weather-bleached weapons and a wooden
water-vessel or coolamen. Continuing they passed in the course of
the afternoon two more of these ghastly warnings, one with the
dried skin still enshrouding it. As they went on the spinifex
gave way to better grass, the denudation of the basalt producing
a mere fertile soil than the desert sandstone. In time the grass
grew thicker and greener, and about an hour before sunset a faint
smell of damp smelling wind met them, and the thirsty horses
pushed eagerly on, sniffing the air with dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>'I believe there's a swamp ahead!' called out Thorpe, turning
in his saddle.</p>

<p>Drew waved his hand in assent, and they soon emerged on a
strip of open country, and before them was a belt of tall green
bulrushes.</p>

<p>The horses ran into the shallow water, and drank greedily.
When their thirst was appeased the men turned them back to the
nearest timber, and camped.</p>

<p>Drew looked round for a tree to serve as a crow's; nest, for
the rushes grew too high to see them from the ground. He picked
on a tall bloodwood, and surmounting the naked stem by means of a
few tomahawk notches, he soon was up aloft. Below Thorpe heard a
loud shout of triumph, and looking up, saw his companion throw
his hat wildly into the air.</p>

<p>'Come up here! Come up here!' he cried.</p>

<p>Thorpe kicked off his boots, and quickly joined his;
companion; when he too; shouted in unison with him.</p>

<p>They overlooked the reeds, and saw beyond a sheet of open
water extending, to the south, terminated northward by the field
of rocks they had been skirting, adown the slope of which gushed
numberless tiny rills and cascades. Across the lakelet was
another belt of tall rushes, which screened the shore from view.
The bosom of this secluded and solitary lake reflected the
glowing tints of red and gold now spreading over the evening
sky; the bright green rushes framed the emblazoned surface that,
rippled by the falling streamlets that fed it, seemed sparkling
with fire, and flame.</p>

<p>But it was the Peak, the hoped for Peak, still distant, but a
tangible reality, no longer a vision of the dawn, a mirage of the
morning, that wrung from them a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>'What could have killed those niggers whose bones we saw?'
asked Drew, when, having finished a satisfactory meal, they lay
smoking restful pipes.</p>

<p>'Can't understand. Its a puzzle altogether. I suppose we shall
find out in time.'</p>

<p>That night their sleep was sound and heavy; if perchance one
awoke the plash of the water falling into the lake, plainly
audible in the silent night soon lulled him to slumber once more
by its soothing sound.</p>

<p>Drew awoke first. He felt drowsy, and his head was heavy.
Around all was enveloped in dense mist and the blankets were
saturated with dew. He rose to his feet, and immediately a sense
of giddiness seized him, and he dropped on the ground. The
movement aroused Thorpe, who was about rising, when he heard
Drew's weak voice&mdash;'Don't get up! Lie still, lie still!'</p>

<p>'What's the matter, old man?' he asked, obeying the
injunction, however.</p>

<p>'Wait! Breathe through your blanket.' Thorpe kept still, and
presently Drew spoke again from beneath his rug.</p>

<p>'This mist is poisonous. It turned me sick and giddy; we must
keep our heads low until the sun disperses it.'</p>

<p>Thorpe looked at his watch. 'Man, it's past '9 o'clock!'</p>

<p>They lay still for some time, then Thorpe suddenly exclaimed,
'The horses! They must be suffocated by it.'</p>

<p>Drew made no answer, he seemed falling asleep again.</p>

<p>In time the sun's rays struggled through the steamy
atmosphere, and the vapor broke into clouds, rose upwards, and
dissolved in the warm upper air. Thorpe sprang up. Bending over
Drew, he tried to rouse him, but it was some time before he
succeeded.</p>

<p>'The air is pure again now, get up and pull yourself
together.'</p>

<p>Drew got up, supported by his friend, and gazed somewhat
vacantly around.</p>

<p>'By Jove, that mouthful I swallowed nearly did for me.'</p>

<p>Thorpe looked anxiously around for the horses. Two were
visible near the rocks stretched out at full length. They went
towards them, Drew still complaining of feeling giddy. Both were
dead. Two further on along the lake were also lying down, but
they seemed recovering under the influence of the fresh air.</p>

<p>In the distance they saw the other two, but they were on their
legs feeding, apparently unaffected.</p>

<p>'That suffocating stuff must come from that old lava bed,'
said Thorpe, 'the horses that were nearest to it are dead.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter,' replied Drew in an absent manner. 'We
shan't want them any more.'</p>

<p>'Not want them! How are we to get back? Man alive, you're
dreaming.'</p>

<p>'No, I'm awake. Once I dreamt, but that is all past. Let us
stay here where there are no dreams, nothing but sleep, sound
sleep!'</p>

<p>Thorpe looked at him with alarm.</p>

<p>'Touch of the sun, or fever,' he muttered, then led the
other's faltering steps back to the camp. Looking through the
pack-bags he found some quinine and a bottle of brandy they had
brought with them. He mixed a stiff dose and induced Drew to
swallow it got him to lie down, and fixed the blankets up as a
shade. For some time he muttered restlessly, but presently slept
soundly.</p>

<p>Thorpe looked around; the two horses had got on their legs,
and were feeding, or trying to.</p>

<p>'This is a nice fix,' he muttered.</p>

<p>Drew seemed sleeping peacefully, so he went over to the wall
and climbed along the rocks until he could see up the long vista
of the lake. It was a fair and beautiful scene, full of quiet
repose.</p>

<p>'What a lovely spot to be such a pest-hole?' he thought. He
ascended one of the highest boulders in the neighborhood, but
could see nothing but the black rocks extending northward as far
as his sight could travel. Westward he could see the top of the
peak.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Drew awoke complaining of headache, but he
looked himself again, and spoke rationally. They shifted their
camp some miles away from the rocks, and turned the horses well
down the lake. In the morning no ghostly fog enwrapped them, but
they could see it in the distance lying low on the ground like a
white cloud. The horses were better, but Thorpe thought it wiser
to spell for a couple of days, and look about.</p>

<p>'This explains those dead niggers,' Drew said, when they were
chatting by the fire that night.</p>

<p>'Yes, they must have come tired out to that basalt wall, lain
down to sleep, and have been suffocated. I suppose, it's some
gaseous exhalation from crevices in the old lava bed that the
cooler air before dawn keeps from rising. Something like the
famous <i>grotta del cane</i>.'</p>

<p>During the two days' rest they took short rides about the
neighborhood, rounding the lake, and examining the country on the
other side of it. It was a long way round, but at the lower end
they found plenty of wild fowl and other birds, nature seemingly
teaching them to avoid the dangerous end near the basalt wall.
Across the lake the country rose in a gradual ascent, and from
the crest they obtained a good view of the peak and the range of
which it was part Apparently, it was some twenty miles away
still, and from their position they could see the country around,
which presented a very broken and rugged appearance.</p>

<p>On the third day they made a fresh start Their number of pack
horses being now lessened they left a pack saddle and some of
their rations securely hidden, and Thorpe marked a tree on their
tracks where they, turned the corner of the basalt wall. At the
foot he buried a tin with a paper inside, telling of the vapor
and its deadly effects. This, in case his brother should, despite
his warning, follow up their trail.</p>

<p>Descending the opposite slope of the ridge on the western side
of the lake, they now had the Peak of Sunrise in sight due ahead
of them. The way grew barren and stony, the valleys they
traversed were narrow and gloomy, even under the garish sunshine
of noon. The ring of their iron-shod horses echoed and re-echoed
from side to side of the rocky gorges they threaded, and always
in front of them towered the grim and silent peak. At last they
reached a kind of sandy marsh, which seemed to extend along the
base of the peak; the rushes growing in its shallow depths were
not tall and vigorous as the bulrushes on the lake, so they could
see over them as they rode through. Weeds were rank on the
bottom, and from the open pools and spaces, rose flocks of
alarmed ducks in noisy flight. Cranes, native companions, and
water-hens abounded, and in one large stretch of open water they
saw a fleet of the grotesque-headed pelicans.</p>

<p>At last they reached the shore, and saw before them a rugged
defile descending from the peak between two spurs. Up this they
rode. They had ascended about half a mile, picking their way
carefully amongst the boulder-strewn ground, when, oppressed by
the gloomy silence and barren nature of their surroundings,
Thorpe called loudly to Drew:</p>

<p>'Shall we go back and turn but at the water for a spell?'</p>

<p>A clattering echo succeeded the shout; and when, it ceased,
and the men still sat listening for its weird mocking, yells of
maniac laughter resounded on all sides. Thorpe, who was behind,
pushed on to his comrade, and the two men looked at each, other
in amazement; mixed with a sense of fear, which could well be
forgiven.</p>

<p>'Look there!' suddenly gasped Drew. Round a jutting point came
the dark figures of about twenty natives, but such figures as men
only see in the wild horror of delirium. They were bony, lean,
and naked, but that was nothing. In their faces was the soulless
vacancy of imbecility, their blubber lips were twisted into apish
mouthings, their hair hung matted to their shoulders, and their
eyes, rheumy, and bleared, gazed at the travellers without life
or speculation: They advanced, making freakish antics, and
pointing with clawlike fingers at the white men.</p>

<p>Suddenly one stopped and commenced to howl with the same
insane gibber of laughter that they had just heard. The others
took it up, and the echoes of their horrible, inhuman mirth rang
in wild discord from cliff to cliff. Instead of coming nearer,
these beings now climbed up the rocky slopes like goats, their
lean limbs seemingly possessed with the prehensile power of the
monkey. One old, white-haired man stood out on a jutting ledge
and again led the insane chorus, that now seemed more, demoniac
than ever. As the white men watched, awe-struck and undetermined,
they saw one of the others, crawling cat-like behind the old man.
With a vigorous push the miserable, wretch was sent headlong into
the valley, and higher and higher shrieked the frantic yells of
glee as his white head crashed on the rocks, and his blood dyed
it red.</p>

<p>'My God! We've got into a land of mad men!' said Thorpe.</p>

<p>As if excited by witnessing this deed of death, a woman with a
child in her arms raised it high above her head, then threw it
into the valley, where it fell on the rocks close to the
horror-stricken men, who turned with one impulse and rode back to
the swamp, where their startled loose horses had already preceded
them.</p>

<p>'Let us go over to the other side,' said Drew hoarsely; and
they rode splashing through the water, as if it could wash out
the horror they had just witnessed.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THERE was little talk between the two adventurers that night,
and it was some time before they slept Thorpe woke up suddenly.
The full moon was nearly overhead, and its electric-like light
made everything clear, throwing black shadows where it did not
penetrate. He arose and looked seaward. The peak rose dark and
sharply outlined. He stooped and roused Drew.</p>

<p>'The peak is calling us,' he said. 'Let us go up there
to-night, and we shall not see those awful beings. Come!'</p>

<p>Drew showed no surprise.</p>

<p>'It calls me too! Let us go!'</p>

<p>They waded across the shallow swamp and walked up the gully
that ran down from, the peak. Keeping steadily on, they reached
the spot where the steep ascent commenced. In about an hour's
time they had reached a jutting shoulder just above the base of
the topmost peak, that shot up high above them, seemingly
unscalable. Below them lay stretched the level country, long
lines of brilliant light and deep shadow running over it, All was
silent and still&mdash;no sign of the monstrous inhabitants.</p>

<p>'We can never reach the top!' said Drew.</p>

<p>'Never reach the top!' repeated an echo, so plain that both
men started nervously.</p>

<p>Drew started to work his way round to the western side. Thorpe
followed him. They found that the shoulder was broader on this
side, and they seemingly looked down into a dark and fearful
gorge, into which the moonbeams failed to penetrate.</p>

<p>Drew threw himself down, and Thorpe did the same.</p>

<p>'I am tired,' said the latter. 'Why did we come here?'</p>

<p>'It called us, and we had to obey,' answered Drew.</p>

<p>'But see!' he cried, leaping to his feet, 'what is it that
comes?'</p>

<p>Out of the darkness of the gorge rose a solemn shape. It
floated upward until it reached the two men, and they saw a face
of stern, calm majesty.</p>

<p>'Come with me,' it said; and the two men rose to their feet
and went upward with the figure, and stood on the highest point
of the peak, and between them was the figure, now turned to
stone, and awful in its cold stillness.</p>

<p>'Look at what you have dreamt,' it said, in a voice that
chilled the listeners.</p>

<p>Drew looked down the fearful space into the abyss of darkness,
and saw moving shadows that seemed to group and gather, until
indistinctly they formed pictures and scenes of what had once
been his dearest topes and aspirations. But they were shadowy and
unreal, until at last they crystallised into a face&mdash;the
face of one he loved, the girl he hoped to make his wife; and he
saw it, not old with years, but old with grief, and care, and
worry, and above all disappointment, and he thought that he could
tell that the disappointment was for him.</p>

<p>The voice beside and above him spoke.</p>

<p>'The fulfilment of dreams is regret and sorrow. Why seek it?
It is better not to dream.'</p>

<p>And to Drew the face faded away, and he saw only the darkness;
and that seemed the best.</p>

<p>His companion, too, had looked down in the darkness and seen the
hopes he had cherished fade as they appeared, until but the face
of an old woman remained, worn and lined, with all life gone out
of it and Thorpe knew it for his own, and like Drew he heard the
voice telling of the vanity of dreams fulfilled, and like him he
seemed to see respite only in the blackness of darkness beneath
their feet.</p>

<p>The men looked up at the face of the stone being, and saw
there nothing but calm&mdash;calm without hope&mdash;nothing but
eternal indifference, in which there was neither joy nor sorrow;
and they seemed to recognise that the desire and zest of life was
in dreams, dreams that if accomplished would bring nothing but
regret and misery; and it was better not to dream; and they laid
themselves down on the edge of the gloomy chasm at the feet of
the great stone figure, looking out into the mighty distance, and
slept.</p>

<p><br>
THE SPLASH and whirr of wings and the loud clacking of the
water-fowl awoke the sleepers beside the sandy swamp. Drew sat up
and looked around. Thorpe was just throwing off his blanket and
yawning drowsily.</p>

<p>'By Jove, I dreamt we went up that peak last night,' said
Drew, 'and went to sleep on it! An awful way up. Suppose we fell
down here.</p>

<p>'I had some dream of the same sort. I. thought that everything
was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no good in
anything.'</p>

<p>'I wish those horrible madmen were a dream.'</p>

<p>'So do I. We shall have to tackle them to-day.'</p>

<p>Drew looked up at the peak. 'How dull it looks. The sun
doesn't seem to brighten it at all, now we are here.</p>

<p>'It's like any dream last night&mdash;very beautiful when seen
at a distance, but disappointing when reached.'</p>

<p>'Hanged if it's worth going up; but I want to see over the
other side. I think we can ride over that shoulder at the base of
the peak.' That will us leaving our horses to look after
themselves.'</p>

<p>In an hour's time they were ready to start, and riding through
the lagoon, entered once more the valley of horror they had seen
the day before. Now it seemed silent, and the men were afraid to
speak, lest they should rouse the echoes of that gruesome
laughter once again. They rode quietly on until they commenced
the steeper ascent of the shoulder, and as they neared it the
remembrance of the dream came back vividly to both of them.</p>

<p>They reached the crest of the ridge, and looked eagerly down.
The peak rose bare and erect beside them, as it did in the
moonlight of their dream, but there was no mysterious gorge below
now. The ridge ran down to a rocky gully, and beyond were but
broken spinifex ridges, with patches of dark mulga scrub, nothing
but the desert country of the interior.</p>

<p>As they looked there came over both of them a feeling of
disappointment; but how they were disappointed they could not
explain. The country was just what they would have expected to
find if they had been asked beforehand. But, nevertheless, they
experienced a kind of depression and dreariness for which there
was no cause. Suddenly Thorpe called Drew's attention to some
objects in the gully below.</p>

<p>'Good heavens! there are those wretched beings again!' cried
Drew.</p>

<p>They were outlined against the sky, and the blacks caught
sight of them. From down below rose the faint sound of their
hellish chorus, as they indulged in their wild antics and
gestures. Thorpe averted his eyes with disgust.</p>

<p>'Let us get back, old man. We've seen all we want to. We'll
become like those animals if we stop here any longer.'</p>

<p>Drew glanced up at the peak, now nothing but fifty feet of
naked, barren rook, on which no majestic figure sat now.</p>

<p>'Yes; let us go back; or we'll find our other dreams as barren
as this Peak of Sunrise.'</p>

<p>They turned their horses; but as they descended the brow of
the rise a laugh of triumph and mockery rang in the rocky hollows
of the place and echoed far down the gully. It did not come from
the beings down below, but both men could have sworn it came from
the top of the peak.</p>

<p>Their homeward way was easy, but a blight seemed to have
fallen on their spirits, which did not lighten until the familiar
outline of the Station outbuildings came in view.</p>

<p>Thorpe's brother met them, and asked a few questions as they
unsaddled and unpacked. Then he drew his brother on one side,
and, with a grave face, showed him a telegram.</p>

<p>'It came over from the township last night. Boston brought it
over himself.'</p>

<p>It was short, as all such messages were, and announced the
death of their sister on the night they had dreamed of standing
on the peak. Drew's dream had really vanished. That night his
sweetheart had died.</p>

<p>No one has seen the Peak of Lost Dreams since, nor the foul
creatures that live there; but some day the old lava-bed will
claim a few more victims.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. &mdash; McPHAIL'S ROAN BULL</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 17 Dec 1898</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
I WISH to say that I had no hand whatever in the production of
the ghost of McPhail's roan bull. I make this statement
designedly because many people, With McPhail amongst if them,
although he's dead now, assert that I prepared a live animal to
represent the ghost of McPhail's roan bull, which appeared after
the death of the animal, at Danwiga Station, and was the cause of
such disastrous doings.</p>

<p>Personally I know that on two occasion the apparition of
McPhail's roan bull was a true ghost; of the other occasions on
which it was alleged to have appeared, I knew nothing. This
statement I have solemnly made before, but nobody has believed
me, so, before telling the story, and I am going to tell it
truthfully, I desire to make the statement once more.</p>

<p>McPhail bore me no love, of that I am aware, but our stations
adjoined, and we were on speaking terms, sufficiently to behave
in a decent and neighborly way towards each other. He thought
that I envied him his well-known stud bull, King Pippin, sire
imported, and had designs on that noble animal. I admit that I
admired the beast which McPhail, by no judgment of his own, had
imported into the district, but I did not envy him the possession
of the bull, or think of doing him an injury.</p>

<p>But that was the way with McPhail. He thought everyone who saw
red headed Mrs. McPhail fell in love with her, and wanted to
elope with her, and he had a collie that he watched over at
night, and, though no one would have had the cur at a gift,
imagined every body was going to steal it.</p>

<p>One would have thought that McPhail would have been happy in
possessing all these things which he valued so highly. But he
wasn't. He always imagined that someone was going to steal them.
And he felt mad when nobody tried to, or wanted to. If one had
only run off with Mistress McPhail, or stolen the collie, he
would have pursued them with all the vengeance of man and law,
and never ceased to talk of it afterwards, but the only thing
that was of any real value took sick and died on his hands,
principally from the distracted efforts he made to cure the
animal, and that was the roan bull, King Pippin.</p>

<p>So afflicted was McPhail at the sickness of the animal that he
even sent over for my assistance. But the bull was <i>in
extremis</i> when I arrived, so what little assistance I could
have given was not needed. McPhail, needless to remark, was more
than deeply distressed about the death of the be loved and
admired bull. Distressed was no name for it, he was bereft of
reason for the time. I am quite sure that he would have preferred
Mrs. McPhail to have been the victim of Fate.</p>

<p>'It's the work of some scoundrel, some enemy,' and he looked
fiercely at me, 'who envied me the possession of that noble
creature, and, failing to steal him, poisoned him.'</p>

<p>'McPhail, you're a fool,' I said. 'If you mean me, you're
telling an untruth. And you know it.'</p>

<p>'How should I know it, man, surrounded as I am by enemies, who
longed for that bull; how should I know what to think? Answer me
that now?'</p>

<p>'How can I answer it? The bull's been fed up too much, and
anything may kill him. You know that yourself. You've been
stuffing him too full of green feed, or letting him stuff
himself.'</p>

<p>'I think I know how to feed stud cattle better than you,
Glaisher,' he said.</p>

<p>'Well, I wish you knew how to feed me. Here I've ridden twelve
miles to see your confounded bull. I can't bring him to life
again, or I would; and you're going to let me go home with out
asking me if I have a mouth on me.'</p>

<p>This touched McPhail on a weak point, and brought him to the
ground&mdash;for, to tell the truth, he was not inhospitable. He
muttered something about being put out by what had happened, and
led the way to the house. Here, after our meal, McPhail grew
somewhat himself, and said he had given orders to have the bull
skinned.</p>

<p>'Don't do anything of the sort,'. I said hastily. 'You don't
know what that bull died off.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Mean! Why, you know as well as I do that you might get one of
your men blood-poisoned if the beast had died of "Cumberland" or
anything of that sort.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll do it myself,' he said, jumping up from the
table.</p>

<p>'Don't!' shrieked Mrs. McPhail. 'Mr. Glaisher is quite night;
you don't know what you might catch?'</p>

<p>'Don't I? I'm going to catch the hide of my roan bull, King
Pippin,' he said, getting up and leaving the room.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't let him do it; don't let him do it!' sobbed Mrs.
McPhail.</p>

<p>'I can't stop him from doing it,' I returned. 'He knows the
danger as well as I do.'</p>

<p>However, I got up and followed McPhail down to the yard, and
found him with a knife and steel to his hand. I argued and
remonstrated over the body of that wretched animal, who must have
heard every word of it, and at last succeeded in restraining
McPhail from carrying out his intention.</p>

<p>'The beast is cold by this time, and you'd have a job to take
his hide off. Look what a sight he'd appear badly skinned. Why,
if I was the bull, I'd haunt you.'</p>

<p>I think McPhail was touched, for he gave orders to get a
couple of draught horses up and drag King Pippin away in the bush
for a bit and cremate his body. Much relieved, I rode home. I had
seen one case of blood poisoning, and did not want ever to
witness another. Not that I really believed that the bull died of
anything but a surfeit of green feed; but still, when anything
dies suddenly&mdash;horse, bull, bullock, or sheep&mdash;there is
always danger in handling the body with bare hands. So I went
home with a good con science, and a highly satisfactory feeling
of having saved a woman being from destruction.</p>

<p>Did I? I'm afraid not. It must have been about the middle of
the night when a peculiar kind of voice awoke me, saying, 'I say,
Glaisher!'</p>

<p>I awoke at once. The room was flooded with the most brilliant
moonlight, and in the middle stood King Pippin; or, rather, the
ghost of King, Pippin; for no respectable bull would walk into
any man's bedroom at the dead hour of night, with his hide flayed
off, and flayed in the most disgraceful fashion&mdash;cuts and
gashes everywhere.</p>

<p>'Don't be frightened, Glaisher,' said the appearance, 'I bear
you no grudge. On the contrary. You succeeded in stopping that
fool McPhail from taking my hide off, and this is the figure I
should have looked. Do you call it a pretty figure?'</p>

<p>'Scarcely,' I returned, regarding the object before me. And I
leave it to anybody to say whether a bull without its hide would
look a pretty object, excepting to a medical student.</p>

<p>'Say, why have you come to see me about the matter? I saved
your carcass from the indignity?'</p>

<p>'I know you did, and I thought that you would like to see how
I would have looked if McPhail had succeeded in his design.'</p>

<p>'I am awfully obliged,' I remarked, 'but really, if you hadn't
taken the trouble, it would have been just as jolly.'</p>

<p>'Think I'll frighten McPhail?'</p>

<p>'No doubt of it frighten him off the station, I should
think.'</p>

<p>'I should like to. The mean dog! After stuffing me with rank,
green feed, and then, doctoring me to death, he wants to skin me.
Now, if he'd only wanted to saw off my horns and preserve them as
a friendly memento, it would not have been so bad. But to want to
skin me for what my hide would fetch, after pretending such love
for me. Pooh! I'll give him the cold sweats to night.
So-long!'</p>

<p>'Hold on!' I cried. 'Think of Mrs. McPhail. Don't frighten
her.'</p>

<p>'No, you donkey. We ghosts can materialise before whom we
like. Mrs. McPhail will be sleeping soundly, while McPhail will
be half out of his mind.'</p>

<p>In an instant the portent had vanished, and I got out of any
bed and looked about the floor, expecting to find bloodstains all
over it, bat no, there was nothing, and I came to the conclusion
that ghosts were bloodless.</p>

<p>This occasion was one of the two which I can affirm to the
actual appearance of McPhail's bull.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
EARLY next morning came a hasty messenger over to my place. He
had been riding hard, and handed me a note marked 'URGENT.'</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><i>'Come over, please, and see McPhail,'</i> it
read; <i>'I don't know what can have come to him since King
Pippin died. Do come, if you have time.'</i></p>

<br>

<p>This was signed with, what I presumed were, Mrs McPhail's
initials. Naturally I saddled my horse and went.</p>

<p>I found McPhail very wild-looking, and certainly not himself.
He began at me at once. 'Glaisher, what did you mean by saying
that King Pippin would haunt me? Last night I saw him! I saw him,
I tell you, and I believe it was your doing.'</p>

<p>'Oh, hang it, man! King Pipping burst. How could you see him
last night?'</p>

<p>'I heard a voice calling "McPhail! McPhail! get up and see
your work!" Up I got, and came out side. There I saw an animal
like King Pippin would have been if I had taken the hide off his
cold carcass with a blunt knife. Like I was going to do. Now tell
me, man; tell me, it was no trick of yours. If I thought that it
was I should be all right, after I'd punched you, or you'd
punched me. But not if it was a real spook! My sinful soul! I
shall go mad!'</p>

<p>I did my very best to quieten the man down, and persuade him
that' it was a dream, but I had a hard job, and besides, he had
shouted his accusation against me out so loud, I know that from
that occasion arose the idea that I had been playing ghost
tricks. I managed to a certain extent, and we went down and
looked at the charred remains of King Pippin, and gradually he
got reconciled to the Idea that he had experienced only a hideous
nightmare; but I knew in my own heart that it was nothing of the
sort.</p>

<p>Sometimes now I feel sorry that I had not lied to the man. It
might have saved his life. How ever, it was not to be, and I
returned home, leaving McPhail a little calmed down.</p>

<p>That night I was again awakened by the ghost of the flayed
bull, who hadn't been flayed.</p>

<p>'Glaisher!' he said, in that calm, familiar manner that ghosts
assume. 'What am I to do? I had no intention, I assure you, of
driving McPhail to such an extreme, but from the way he spoke
about me when you were talking over my body, I concluded that the
man had no heart, no feelings. Now I see that he has, and I feel
deep regret about the matter.'</p>

<p>'Well don't go appearing to him any more then, and he will
soon get all right.'</p>

<p>'Very easy to say that; but if you were a ghost you would know
different. If you appear to a man once, you must appear to him
three times. It's a law no ghost can break.'</p>

<p>'If you show up to McPhail any more you'll drive him out of
his mind,' I replied.</p>

<p>'I don't want to do that; but what am I to do? I must go and
see him again; I'm bound to tell you.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you must you must; but must you go to-night?
Otherwise, we might fix things up a little.'</p>

<p>'How do you mean?'</p>

<p>'I persuaded McPhail that he had experienced a bad nightmare,
and he seemed to think that I had been playing a trick on him.
Now, I will let him hold that opinion, and think that I have been
playing a trick on him.'</p>

<p>'And cast dishonor on the ghosts. Let it be thought that a
real genuine ghost was only a turnip and a candle, so to speak.
No! not to be thought of.'</p>

<p>'I can think of nothing else. Can't you put it off until
to-morrow night?'</p>

<p>'I can do that if you'll promise not to play any tricks in the
meantime.'</p>

<p>'Very well.'</p>

<p>'Honour bright?'</p>

<p>I gave my word, and the ghost of King Pippin departed with the
same celerity as he did the night before.</p>

<p><br>
I HAD to keep my word even to a ghost, but I determined to go
and sleep over at McPhail's. I had a good excuse, just to look
after him in his nervous condition. So I went. Mrs. McPhail was
glad to see me, and told me that her husband had passed but a
restless night, and he too was glad to welcome me to stop the
night. I determined to keep awake, as I was certain that I should
hear the ghost's voice as well as McPhail, but I didn't, or,
rather, I dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>I awoke with a start, and instinctively went out on the
verandah. Good heavens; there in the brilliant moonlight stood
McPhail, talking to something that&mdash;that night&mdash;I could
not see. He had a revolver in his hand, and, shouting loudly to
Mrs. McPhail, I ran down the two or three steps of the verandah,
and I distinctly heard these words.</p>

<p>'Then you must come again?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I must!' came a voice from the invisible.</p>

<p>'Then I can't stand another sight of you!', and before I could
get near he had shot himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. McPhail was just behind me, and there was a terrible
scene, into which I need not go into details. But McPhail had
gone to join King Pippin in ghostland, and, perhaps, he was
happier.</p>

<p>That really is all I know about the tragedy.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; A YEAR'S REPRIEVE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 20 Aug 1898</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
SILENCE all around. In the fading light, the wide plain in
front of the belt of stunted trees was gradually shrinking in
size, but still retaining an impression of vast and illimitable
space. The brightest of the constellations were already visible,
remaining stars were rapidly peopling the dark spaces with
shining points of light. But they only seemed to increase the
overwhelming sense of loneliness. Like the boundless plain and
the brooding, haunting stillness, these cold, pitiless but
beautiful watchers of the night brought no suggestion of
companionship. No mere human tragedy could win aught but stern
indifference from them.</p>

<p>Gradually the western flush faded and died, and the feeling of
being the last man on a dead world came strongly over the
solitary figure lying at the edge of the scanty forest But of all
things around the terrible unbroken silence pained him the worst
and seemed to the sick man the most dreadful part of the torture
Nature was inflicting on him. The agony of being alone in the
darkness and stillness gave him strength to rise, and with
tottering limbs, from which the fever had sapped all vigor, he
sought for dried sticks and leaves to build a fire. It was not
needed for warmth, for the night was windless and sultry, but it
would be alive, with some sort of motion and noise&mdash;it would
be a companion.</p>

<p>When he had finished his task he sank down, shaking with
weakness. The fire created a little circle of light, and made the
outside darkness blacker than before.</p>

<p>This surrounding of shadow worked on the sick man's nerves.
All manner of strange and threatening spectres might be hiding in
its shrouding gloom. He tried to concentrate his attention on the
crackling fire, but every now and then he would have to steal a
fearful look round to make sure that some grim phantom was not
peering over his shoulder. Gradually the sense of his hopeless
position absorbed even this terror, and a desperate resolve came
into his mind. Why linger thus through the long watches of the
night, waiting for daylight and&mdash;death? His end was sure,
why not anticipate it and do away with so much suffering?</p>

<p>He drew his revolver and looked at it. It would be quick and
easy, and he would no more fear heat and thirst, nor the torments
of fever and solitude. He would leave a memorandum of his name
and fate lest anyone should eventually find his remains, and he
took a letter from his pouch and prepared to write on the back of
it. As he commenced to write by the flickering and uncertain
firelight he began to reflect how this little scrap of paper,
that a puff of wind could waft away, was the only connecting link
between him and his kind; how, at that moment, cheery
companionship was filling all the homes in Australian cities and
towns all over the continent.</p>

<p>The feeling of wretched abandonment was too much for him. He
dropped the letter and took up the pistol.</p>

<p>What was that? A sound! a noise!</p>

<p>Impossible in this horrible solitary land. He listened
eagerly. It was but fancy. No, it was real&mdash;men were talking
out on the great plain. He heard a human voice once more after
having given up all hope. He tried to shout, but his voice was
weak and hoarse.</p>

<p>The fire! He must make it burn up to guide them.</p>

<p>Out on the plain two men with packhorses were travelling that
summer night, making a short cut in the cooler night across the
long dry expanse they had to cross. They were perforce silent,
for one was riding ahead, the other driving the horses after him.
Suddenly the leader stopped.</p>

<p>'What is it?' his companion asked, coming up to him.</p>

<p>'I could have sworn I saw the light of a fire over there just
now.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, man, who could be out here? The country has not
been burnt either, or we should have seen the smoke.'</p>

<p>The other did not reply, but continued looking steadily in the
direction where he had fancied he saw the light.</p>

<p>'It is a fire,' he said at last. 'Look right under Orion's
belt There now, it is quite plain.'</p>

<p>'You're right The blacks have been travelling across and left
something burning. There's no water anywhere about here, as you
know as well as I do.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go over and see?'</p>

<p>'It's a good bit off our track; we could see a fire a long way
on this plain.'</p>

<p>The other reflected. 'We ought to hear the horse bells if a
white man is camped there.'</p>

<p>'You can't hear a bell far on a plain.'</p>

<p>'I don't think we'll take the trouble,' said the one who had
been leading. Even as he spoke the spark of light burned up
bright and unmistakable.</p>

<p>'Looks as though somebody had just made it up.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go over?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the other, turning his horse's head to the
direction. 'We may as well see what it is.'</p>

<p>When the two reached the place they saw some sticks dying down
into red embers and a senseless body lying alongside the expiring
beacon that had brought him, almost miraculous, assistance. The
cool water from a water-bag moistening his baked lips and parched
tongue aroused the man from his faint. He opened his eyes, and
then closed them and lay quiet, striving to realise the blissful
sensation of being again amongst his own kind; feeling a dread
fear that their friendly hands and voices were part of a fevered
dream, and would disappear when he aroused himself
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Then he realised that it was not imagination. The noise of the
horses, the men's voices, and the blessed water were facts. He
sat up and opened his eyes again.</p>

<p>'Good heavens, it's Newton!' said one of the rescuers. 'What
on earth are you doing here in this state?'</p>

<p>Newton laughed, feebly and hysterically. 'Ewart, is it? I was
dying, Tom; but I'm going to try and live now.'</p>

<p>'Don't talk any more,' interrupted Morrison, the otter one of
the two. 'Put the quarts on, Tom, and I'll turn the horses out
for a bite while we doctor your friend up.'</p>

<p>'He's had the fever bad and lost his horses,' said Ewart, when
his friend came back from hobbling their horses out.</p>

<p>'Fever, eh?' returned Morrison. 'I've got some quinine with
me; I'll give him a dose.'</p>

<p>He went over to the pack bags, and got out the squat phial
that quinine is generally put into.</p>

<p>Newton, the owner of a newly formed station on a western river
in Queensland, had been suffering for some time with the
intermittent Queensland malarial fever common to freshly-occupied
country. He had started to ride in to civilisation for a change,
to try and shake it off.</p>

<p>Being shorthanded on the station, he was alone on his journey,
and during a fresh attack of illness his horses had seized the
opportunity, and made away. As soon as he was able to move he
followed them. He tracked them to a small, muddy waterhole just
on the point of drying up, and the next day had followed them to
the edge of the great plain. There, overcome by heat, fever, and
exhaustion; and with as empty water-bag, he had succumbed.</p>

<p>Ewart told these details to Morrison, as they stood by the
rescued man, who, overcome by the nourishment and the relief of
the strain, was sleeping quietly on the rugs and blankets they
had spread for him.</p>

<p>'It's no good spoiling your visit, Ewart,' said Morrison.
'He's right enough now. I'll bring him in. You pack up and push
on. You'll get to Donovan's early In the morning.'</p>

<p>'If you really think you can manage,' replied Ewart, in a tone
which fully implied which way his inclinations tended.</p>

<p>'Of course I can. Now, don't disappoint them at Donovan's.
You're the expected guest; I am not. I'll turn up in a day or
two&mdash;glad to be out of the birthday festivities.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll make a start.'</p>

<p>'Do. Go quiet; don't wake him. Kind regards to them all; and
tell Miss Halcott she has to thank me for your arrival.'</p>

<p>Quickly Ewart caught his horses and saddled up.</p>

<p>'You'll be able to manage with the spare horse to you get to
where he left his saddle. Keep all the water, I shall get to the
crossing soon after sunset.'</p>

<p>Morrison walked a step with his companion.</p>

<p>'What sort of a fellow is this Newton? Known him long?'</p>

<p>'Some years. He's right enough, but impulsive. Does things
that he is sorry for. Means well, but gives way to his
feelings.'</p>

<p>They shook hands, and one rode on into the starlight; the
other turned back to the fire. Morrison lit his pipe, and stood
watching the sleeper.</p>

<p>'Impulsive,' he thought, 'I should think he was; face looks
quite different already. All nerves, I fancy.'</p>

<p>He was a grizzled, middle-aged man, broad-set, and sunburnt
The sleeper had a thin refined face that was handsome, now that
he was in a pleasant, refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>In about an hour he awoke, and Morrison asked if he would have
some more tea, and try and eat something. He assented gratefully,
and asked where Ewart was.</p>

<p>'He's gone on. He's expected for Christmas at Donovan's place,
and it was no good our both stopping. My name is Morrison; I'm a
neighbor of Ewart's down on the Lookybar.'</p>

<p>'It was very good of you to stop.'</p>

<p>'Don't mention it. Ewart's young, and expects some fun; I've
had mine, and don't care for any more.'</p>

<p>Newton did not reply. He was young, too, young enough to
expect to get some more fun out life.</p>

<p>'How do you feel; suppose you get up and try your legs?'</p>

<p>Newton got up, and found himself stronger and better.</p>

<p>'We must get away as soon as we can,' said Morrison, 'for the
horses want water. How far is it to where you left your saddle
and traps?'</p>

<p>'It must be more than thirty miles.'</p>

<p>'Well, I've a spare riding horse; we must ride him in turns
bare-backed. Think you can manage to start at daylight?'</p>

<p>'I think so,' replied Newton cheerfully.</p>

<p>'Try and go to sleep; I'll wake you in time.'</p>

<p>It was a long wearisome ride for both, for riding a horse
without a saddle during a Queensland summer day is not conducive
to ease. But Morrison took the lion's share, and by sundown they
reached the little creek where Newton had left his saddle and
belongings when he started on his luckless search after the
horses.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN a man with a nice little station gets married, and his
wife has a good-looking sister, it is only a matter of common
charity for that sister to come up on a visit occasionally, just
to prevent the men in the district forgetting what a pretty girl
is like. Miss Halcott had vanquished Ewart on her first visit,
and when she repeated it, and Ewart received an invitation to
ride over and celebrate the first birthday of Donovan's son and
heir, he gladly responded.</p>

<p>Naturally Ewart's tale of seeing the fire and rescuing the
almost dying man, excited much interest, and Donovan drove out
the next day to bring the sufferer in.</p>

<p>'How are you, Morrison, old man. I wouldn't let Ewart come,
although, to do him justice, he offered to. Sorry to meet you in
this plight, Mr. Newton, but we'll put you right if you'll stop
with us a few days.'</p>

<p>The horses were turned out for a spell, and in an hour or two
the party were on their way back to Illingford station. Naturally
Newton was the honored guest amongst the fairer portion of the
assembled party. Certainly he was an interesting man, and one who
knew how to make the most of his personal advantages.</p>

<p>'Norah,' said Donovan to his sister-in-law, 'don't you let
that Newton be always making eyes at you. Ewart's worth twenty of
him.'</p>

<p>Donovan was still too inexperienced in the ways of the other
sex to know, that this was the most indiscreet thing he could
say. Miss Halcott was persuaded in her own heart that Ewart was
far superior to the interesting Newton, but she did not like to
be told about it, and from very defiance allowed Newton to
consider himself a favorite more than ever.</p>

<p>'Wish we'd never have picked the beggar up,' growled Ewart to
his friend.</p>

<p>'Way of the women,' said Morrison. 'Just you get your arm or
leg broken or an eye poked out, and you'll get all Miss Halcott's
attention.'</p>

<p>'The fellow puts on so much side,' continued Ewart. 'Heard him
spouting poetry the other day, and he did it well too. Wasn't
much poetry about him that night.'</p>

<p>Morrison laughed. 'Girl's only amusing herself. Keep your
temper, old man.'</p>

<p>Newton, on his part saw no reason why he should not fall in
love with Norah Halcott if he felt so inclined; nor was there
any. He did not know of Ewart's feelings in the matter, and there
was no one to tell him; so he enjoyed himself as long as his good
taste allowed him to trespass on Donovan's hospitality.</p>

<p>Truth was that the birthday visit had been somewhat prolonged
in consequence of neither of the two men wanting to go away and
leave the other in possession. But when Donovan mentioned that he
could lend Newton horses if he wanted to start, now that he was
well again, why the latter had nothing else to do but prepare for
departure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before he left some references were made to the
hope of meeting again in Sydney, where Miss Halcott lived, and
whither Newton was bound. It was a most harmless piece of common
politeness, but the jealous Ewart construed it differently, and
as he was doomed to a continued exile in the west, he felt
injured.</p>

<p>Naturally when he had the running to himself he put on the
airs of a martyr, which the young lady highly resented.</p>

<p>'You are no worse than other men generally are when they are
in a parlous state, but as an act of friendship allow me to tell
you that you have been acting like a donkey,' said Morrison as,
their visit concluded, they were on their homeward way.</p>

<p>'If Miss Halcott likes that fellow best, why should I
interfere?' answered Ewart loftily. 'She doesn't like that fellow
best, and anyone but a blind owl could see it. There you were in
the straight with Mrs. Donovan to back you up, and you must needs
get on your stilts, as if you expected the girl to come and beg
your Highness's pardon. Likely thing! You're not the Grand
Turk.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't worry me, old man; It's the last visit I'll make
there, I expect.'</p>

<p>'Tommy rot! You'll come round, or else your affection for the
young lady can't be very real.'</p>

<p>'You seem to know all about it.'</p>

<p>'I've had my experience, like most men of my age; and though
it was an unhappy one, I'm glad I had it. I wouldn't forget it if
I could.'</p>

<p>Ewart got off the high horse, and after a short silence spoke
cheerfully to his friend; and they rode along talking of other
things. The summer was dry, and the long looked-for wet came only
in partial thunderstorms&mdash;fierce as regarded thunder and
lightning, mild as regarded the rainfall.</p>

<p>Out of the fair Lookybar River the waters dwindled down to a
few permanent holes, and the heat haze danced over the plains all
day. Morrison stood in the thatched verandah of his rough
stone-and-mud hut, striving like many a western man was doing
that same night to detect some change that might indicate a
break-up of the drought. But the same thunderclouds glowed and
quivered as the lightning permeated them, caught the same red
flare from the setting sun, and promised to vanish as so many had
done before, night after night. Over the rosy glow in the west
hung a few tiny cloudlets, all gold and crimson, and the watcher
turned inside to sit down at his solitary meal which the cook had
just brought in. The same individual poked his head in the
doorway soon afterwards to say that some travellers were
approaching.</p>

<p>Morrison got up and went outside again. Travellers were
rarities in that part of the continent Presently the dust
resolved itself into two men, with a couple of spare horses; and
a near approach proved them to be Donovan and a blackboy.</p>

<p>'What brings you out here?' demanded Morrison in surprise when
they met. 'Business. My partner in Sydney has had Rockvale put
under offer to him, and he wrote up to ask me to go put and
report on it. As there's nothing to be done this weather, I came
at once. Know the place?'</p>

<p>'Very well; it joins my two southern blocks. Come in; I've not
commenced my tea.'</p>

<p>'How's Ewart?' asked Donovan when they were sealed.</p>

<p>'Very well the last time I saw him.'</p>

<p>'Newton, that chap you picked up on the edge of the plain, is
back again; but he did not come our way. Taken the huff for same
reason.'</p>

<p>'I suppose Miss Halcott did not smile on him in Sydney.'</p>

<p>'Something of the sort; but I'm not sorry. He's not my
style.'</p>

<p>They drifted into the routine matters of the bush, and the
subject was not renewed.</p>

<p>In the morning Morrison rode part of the way with Donovan, and
when he left him turned his home's head towards Ewart's place.
The inspection of the adjoining run occupied about a week, and
then when Donovan returned be found Ewart at Morrison's
place.</p>

<p>'Come back with me,' he said; 'there's little chance of rain
now till after the winter, and you can do nothing amongst the
cattle.'</p>

<p>Ewart reflected; but when Donovan remarked as an afterthought
that Miss Halcott intended coming up again daring the winter
months, he finally decided that he would not come back with
Donovan, but that in about six weeks he might look him up, at
which the latter seemed perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p><br>
'NOW that you and Norah have settled it to your satisfaction,'
said Mrs. Donovan to Ewart some time afterwards when they were
talking on the verandah at Illingford, 'I can tell you that
Newton gave her a lot of trouble in Sydney. Wouldn't take no for
an answer, I told her that it was her own fault for encouraging
him; but she declared that she had not encouraged him&mdash;that
whenever he approached the subject she put him off&mdash;that he
was an interesting man to talk to, but nothing more. So you might
just as well have made it right last Christmas, as you see he
had no chance, only in your fancy.'</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that Ewart had made good use of his
time, and was now the accepted of Miss Halcott. Ewart wrote to
Morrison, asking him to keep a lookout for a couple of men, as he
wanted to put on some additions to his house, and telling hint
that the wedding would be at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Morrison laughed when he read it, and some days afterwards was
surprised at receiving a visit from Newton&mdash;surprised, as
his place was nearly one hundred and twenty miles north of his.
Newton, however, stated that he was on the same errand as Donovan
had been, namely, to inspect and report on Rockvale for a Sydney
buyer. He asked after Ewart, but for reasons of his own Morrison
did not then inform him that Ewart was then at Donovan's, nor
that he was engaged to Miss Halcott.</p>

<p>His visitor left the next morning, saying that he would be
back in a week, and duly returned, but Morrison noticed a decided
change in his manner.</p>

<p>'Why did you not tell me that Ewart was up at Donovan's?' he
asked, rather surlily.</p>

<p>'Really, I did not think it of any importance,' replied
Morrison, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>'Oh! It was of no importance, just when I heard at Rockvale
that Donovan had been here, and that Ewart had gone there, I was
surprised at your not mentioning it.'</p>

<p>'What do you think of Rockvale?' asked Morrison.</p>

<p>'Is Miss Halcott at Donovan's?' asked Newton, completely
ignoring the question, and speaking as if under the influence of
a sudden thought.</p>

<p>'Yes, she is; and Ewart and Miss Halcott are engaged, and are
going to be married in a few months. I suppose that is what you
want to know?' replied Morrison, rather out of patience.</p>

<p>Newton looked strangely at him, and Morrison could not help
remembering what his friend had said about his impulsive
nature.</p>

<p>'Going to be married in a few months,' repeated Newton, 'Well,
a good many things may happen in a few months.'</p>

<p>'I suppose they may; but I don't think it would be advisable
for you to interfere in any way.'</p>

<p>'It's no business of yours.'</p>

<p>'Quite right; I've no quarrel with you, Morrison.'</p>

<p>'I don't see why you should have one with Ewart. He helped you
when you wanted it.'</p>

<p>'No! no. That was you, Morrison&mdash;not Ewart; and I am very
glad of it.'</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE winter months passed quickly, and in October the grateful
rains began to fall in copious thunderstorms. In widespread
patches the country began to look green and beautiful. One could
pass from bountiful pasture to stern aridity in a few strides in
some parts, so marked at times was the partial rainfall. But more
or less there had been enough all over the district to relieve
the strain on the overstocked river frontages, and once again the
cattle began to wander back to the smaller creeks and
tributaries; and as November drew near, and the wet season
promised to set in at its wonted time, men looked more cheerful
at the prospect before them.</p>

<p>At Ewart's station the improvements and alterations were
finished, and the owner had been looking over them in the
twilight, when he heard the tread of an approaching horse.
Looking up he saw that it was Newton. He bade him good evening as
he came up, but the other did not dismount, but spoke to him from
the saddle.</p>

<p>Ewart noted that he looked ill and haggard, worse almost than
when they found him on the edge of the plain.</p>

<p>'Can I have a few words with you?' he said.</p>

<p>'Of course; but get off, and come inside.'</p>

<p>'No, thanks. I think you are aware that I had hopes of making
Miss Halcott, the lady you are going to marry, my wife, at one
time?'</p>

<p>'I am aware of it; but I don't see the necessity of discussing
it. Miss Halcott has made her choice between us. That ends
it.'</p>

<p>'I am not going to discuss anything. I only want to ask your
opinion about something. I am in your debt for the relief you
afforded me about a year ago. Now, as you have been the cause of
my hopes having been blighted, we can consider that debt
cancelled, may we not?'</p>

<p>'What nonsense,' said Ewart, with natural irritation. 'If Miss
Halcott was not going to marry me, it would not follow that she
would marry you. Besides, pray banish from your mind once and for
all that you owe me any thanks for the occurrence of that night.
It was Morrison who determined to go over and see the meaning of
the fire, and it was Morrison who stayed with you, and helped you
in. If we had ridden straight on as I suggested, not thinking
that there could be anyone in want of help in such a place, you
would not be alive now. It is to him you are indebted for the
succour, not to me.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to know it for certain. We are on perfectly equal
terms, then?'</p>

<p>'Is that a threat?'</p>

<p>'It is a question.'</p>

<p>'Well, it is answered.'</p>

<p>Newton lifted his hat with mock courtesy, turned his horse's
head, and rode away into the fast gathering darkness.</p>

<p>'The man's off his head,' said Ewart to himself, as he turned
back to the house.</p>

<p>Naturally, the visit disturbed him somewhat, and next morning
be rode over the ten miles that, separated him from his neighbor.
Morrison interrupted him when he commenced his story by telling
him that Newton had been there the night before, and left
immediately after breakfast. 'Did he seem queer?' asked
Ewart.</p>

<p>'No. Not until he was going away. Then he said, "I hope,
Morrison, you will never repent having saved my life that
night."'</p>

<p>They could make nothing of the matter, beyond the rambling
talk of a disappointed man, although Ewart was made anxious;
knowing that under the influence of a hopeless passion men of
Newton's temperament have been known to do strange things.</p>

<p>Newton did put in an appearance at Donovan's again. He was
quite himself, and in spite of all efforts. Norah found herself
betrayed into an interview with him on the verandah.</p>

<p>'Miss Halcott,' he said, 'I want to ask you one question.'</p>

<p>She looked at him in silence.</p>

<p>'If Ewart had not been here, would you have accepted me?'</p>

<p>'I decline to answer such a piece of impertinence,' she
returned.</p>

<p>He looked at her with his face full of pain, and stepped off
the verandah.</p>

<p>On the day that Ewart was expected Donovan drove Norah out to
meet him and his friend. A black thunderstorm was rising in
front of them, muttering and growling.</p>

<p>'We'll push on past 'the galloping ground,' and take shelter
In the old hut,' said Donovan, whipping up his horses. The
'galloping ground' was a piece of road cut through a broad belt
of gidea scrub. It ran in a gradual curve, and was generally in
good repair, hence its name. But the storm came swiftly up, and
burst in their faces, just as they reached the beginning of the
scrub.</p>

<p>Donovan urged on his horses through the driving rain and wind,
the lightning and thunder seemed to be simultaneous, and Norah
beat her head against the fury of the outburst.</p>

<p>Suddenly, everything seemed to crash, together; she remembered
flying forward, and nothing more. Morrison and Ewart reached the
western side of the scrub at the same moment that the others came
in at the eastern. They, too, were pushing on with the storm
chasing them behind. Through the driving rain they caught sight
of the buggy coming full speed round the curve, then there was a
frightened shout from somebody, and all was wreck and confusion.
Hastily dismounting, both men rushed to the assistance of the two
who had been thrown over the splash-board on to the struggling
horses.</p>

<p>Disregarding everything, they managed to drag them out. The
horses still made furious efforts to rise, and one commenced
uttering squeals of pain; and the black boy who had come us cried
out that their legs were entangled in barbed wire. Donovan and
his sister-in-law were insensible, and they laid them by the
roadside. Morrison and the boy, working like demons, freed the
horses at lest, and got the harness off them, while Ewart did
what he could for the sufferers.</p>

<p>The storm cleared off as rapidly as it had come on, and it was
thundering in the distance by the time they had finished, and the
trembling, lamed horses stood by the roadside, while they hastily
shifted the harness on to two of their saddle horses. They had
not spoken, both knew what to do at a glance.</p>

<p>'How are they?' asked Morrison.</p>

<p>'Alive' but I can say no more.'</p>

<p>'I think the buggy will stand to go in with them. We must lose
no time.'</p>

<p>The insensible figures were lifted carefully in, and Morrison
rode on to get some brandy, and report what had happened, while
Ewart and the boy brought the buggy on as quietly as
possible.</p>

<p>As it turned out, tie escape of the occupants had been
miraculous. Both were badly bruised, cut and battered, but beyond
this Donovan had got off with a broken arm and a broken head, and
Norah with a terrible shock and a broken collarbone.</p>

<p>Morrison went back with the man sent to see after the buggy
horses, and carefully examined the scene of the accident, or
rather outrage, for it was evident that the wire had been
purposely stretched across the road. The two horses were
ruined.</p>

<p>It was dark before be got back, and found that Donovan was
fairly recovered, that is to say, he had got back his senses all
right. But he was likely to lose them again with rage when he
heard of the cause of the accident Fortunately the doctor from
the neighboring town was one of the wedding guests, and he
arrived that night.</p>

<p>Next morning Morrison was missing. It soon transpired that he
had had a horse put in the stable the night before, and must have
started off before daylight, as nobody saw him go.</p>

<p>Morrison arrived at the 'galloping ground' soon after sunrise.
He went back to the place where he and Ewart had first caught
sight of the buggy, and tried to locate the spot whence the cry
had come. He was certain it was not uttered by Donovan.</p>

<p>Satisfied as to the whereabouts of it he rode through the
scrub on a particular line, and soon struck the track of a horse
being ridden away from the place.</p>

<p>On, on, through the best part of the day he followed that
track, through scrub and across plains, a silent avenging Fate.
At last he caught sight of his quarry on the bank of a small
creek. A horse was feeding there, and as he drew nearer he saw
the man he sought sitting weary and dejected at the butt of a
tree. The figure rose as he came close to it.</p>

<p>'I'm glad it's you,' said Newton quietly.</p>

<p>'Are you coming back with me?' asked Morrison, getting off his
horse.</p>

<p>'I want to speak to you first. I never dreamt of the buggy
coming. I knew Ewart was expected that day, and I intended to
spoil his wedding trip.'</p>

<p>'And break my neck as well?'</p>

<p>'I did not reckon on you coming. I saw the buggy and was
rushing down to stop them, but what with the wind and the pelting
rain, and the pace they were going at, I was too late. Oh, it was
awful. Tell me, are they hurt much. Not killed surely?'</p>

<p>'Pretty well knocked about, but not killed, no thanks to
you.'</p>

<p>'Morrison, listen,' and the unhappy man came closer to him.
'You remember the night you found me? Just before I heard your
voices I was about to shoot myself. I had given up all hope, and
could not wait through the long night for death to come slowly. I
wish I had! Oh, how I wish I had!'</p>

<p>'I sincerely wish you had.'</p>

<p>'Morrison,' he went on, in pitiful appeal, 'I'll do it now.
Let me do it now. You're a good fellow, and will understand that
it will be for the best.'</p>

<p>Morrison looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>'You were a gentleman once, so I think it will be for the
best. Do it while I'm riding away, but if you don't I'll drag you
in at my horse's tail.'</p>

<p>'I'll do it' He held out his hand. Morrison hesitated, then
took it. He mounted his horse and rode slowly away. A minute
passed.</p>

<p>'Funked it,' the rider muttered. The report of the pistol rang
sharp, and the rider turned back. The soul of the suicide had
gone to another world.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. &mdash; A PLOT THAT FAILED</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 2 Jun 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
THE road was lonely, and the traveller was tired. His horse
was in the same condition. It was late, and the township was
still five miles distant. Therefore, when Dick Roberts, the
traveller in question, saw the dim figure of a dog flitting in
front of his horse in the feeble light of a first-quarter moon,
he harshly commanded it to get out of the road.</p>

<p>The dog did not show any sense of being hurt at the
expressions used by the tired traveller, but approaching him,
jumped up, placed Its forepaws on his foot, and gave at dismal
howl. Then it vanished; that was the uncomfortable thing about
it.</p>

<p>Roberts looked up and down the road, but the thing had gone.
Nevertheless, he could have sworn to seeing and hearing It.
Moreover, he had noticed the kind of dog it was&mdash;a mongrel
fox terrier.</p>

<p>Gradually the idea took shape in his mind that he had seen a
ghost, and, being a superstitious man, he pursued the rest of his
way to the township at the fastest pace that he could induce his
horse to travel.</p>

<p>Arrived there, the first thing he sought, before turning his
horse into the yard with a heap of lucerne, which was all the
stable accommodation the local inn could afford, was for Dutch
courage in fighting rum. Then he told the story.</p>

<p><br>
'FIVE miles from here,' repeated the landlord; 'and a fox
terrier, too; why, that's whereabouts Deaf Tim was found
dead.'</p>

<p>'You don't say so,' said Roberts, 'but seeing as how I never
saw Deaf Tim to my knowledge, nor so much as heard of him, why
should the ghost of his dog appear to me?'</p>

<p>This question the landlord did not attempt to answer; he only
opined that it meant something. Roberts turned his horse out and
sat down to a belated meal in a very bad temper. It was all very
well to say it meant something, but if the supernatural
appearance meant a death warning, what then?</p>

<p>He had swallowed his tea when he heard the landlord's voice
relating the circumstance to another customer.</p>

<p>'Some has it in the shape of snakes, and some in the shape of
rats. Dick here is gone on dogs, saw the ghost of one coming
along the road to-night. Heard him howl, too.'</p>

<p>Dick Roberts arose in his wrath, and went in to interview the
landlord. 'I'm no more balmy than you; but I saw and heard that
dog as plainly as I can see you're ugly phiz right enough. There
now.' Having uttered which defiance, Dick demanded a drink, and
lit his pipe.</p>

<p>The landlord apologised in a blundering sort of way, and the
customer, evidently with an eye to the supernatural, asked Dick
to have another drink, and tell him the story. Others came in,
and Dick told the story again, until at last he got so pot
valiant that he offered to conduct a party back to the spot in
search of the appearance.</p>

<p>All agreed that it must have something to do with the death of
Deaf Tim; but none would go that night, though all expressed
their willingness to go on the morrow, which notion was agreed
to. The next morning the landlord took Dick aside, and talked to
him confidentially.</p>

<p>'I see a good stroke of business in this ghost of your'n if
it's kept up properly,' he said.</p>

<p>In vain Dick repudiated the idea of its being a ghost of his
manufacture.</p>

<p>Said the landlord, 'If it was a real ghost, it won't show up
to a crowd, so I vote we provide one to fill up the bill. Now,
Tom, my man, can fake a horse with anybody; so I suppose he can a
dog, and I'll set him to work.'</p>

<p>Dick argued and protested, but the landlord said that a ghost
was just the thing to start a boom in the township, and at last
convinced him to take a share in the proceedings.</p>

<p>The party was formed, and proceeded to the spot. Of course,
they found nothing, but determined to stay and watch through the
night. They were not disappointed. Tom got very drunk, and
failing other dogs, he rigged up the greatest scarecrow in the
town with whitewash and tar as a fox terrier, and conveyed him to
the scene, and let him loose on the watchers.</p>

<p>The apparition was too much. They all took to their heels, or
their horses' heels, the dog after them, wondering what it was
all about. Tom, watching the spectacle from afar, saw a singular
proceeding.</p>

<p>The dog pursuing the flying citizens was pursued by another
dog, which seized on him and made him yell for mercy. When Tom
came up the dog disappeared in the same mysterious manner as did
the dog seen by Dick. Tom recovered the painted dog and conveyed
him secretly into town, and concealed him there.</p>

<p>When he showed up the company had drunk themselves into
bravery again, and talked of going back&mdash;talked of it only,
another five miles was no joke. The landlord beamed&mdash;his
plan had been most successful. But while in the midst of much
talk and conversation the painted dog, inspired by some unholy
feeling, or urged on by the ghost dog that still pursued him,
broke out from confinement and came plunging into the bar,
uttering howls of terror.</p>

<p>The company broke up without paying for the drinks, and the
landlord's house got the name of being haunted. Everybody went
over to the opposition house, and he was left with Tom and the
painted dog on his hands, where they did not remain long, for he
summarily ejected the pair.</p>

<p>It is reported that the dog still occasionally appears to
benighted travellers, but no one has yet solved the mystery of
his appearance, and from the temper he displayed with his
understudy, nobody cares to try and find out.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; THE HILL OF THE WHITE DEAD</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF THE PITURI COUNTRY</h3>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 3 Oct 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
MILES and miles to the westward. Over the range that guards
the Australian littoral fronting and facing the Pacific. Across
the dry river channels that carry the flood waters of the
Queensland wet season down to the Darling, which in its turn
passes them on to the Murray, and so to the southern sea.</p>

<p>Beyond the wide plains, shadeless and almost treeless, was a
solitary cattle station; new, rough, unpicturesque, and remote
enough to satisfy the unsocial longings of the most sour-minded
of misanthropes. The rough mud walls, the staring iron roof, and
the dusty stockyard, built of timber wonderful in its
crookedness, for straight posts and rails were unobtainable in
that region, were all as prosaic and painfully ugly as the creek,
dotted with gnarled coolibah trees, on the bank of which, it was
formed. Taciturn, bronzed like half-castes, inured to hard fare
and hard work, the men on, it were like the great silent waste
around them, the mighty expanse of interior Australia which awes
men into a sense of their own pettiness. Virtues and vices are
constrained to greatness in the far west&mdash;one could commit
murder, but not petty theft.</p>

<p>Pakeera was the name of the isolated station on the edge of
the fringe of semi-civilisation that intervenes between close
settlement and the great unknown beyond. On the east their
neighbors were some thirty miles away; on the west 350 miles of
loneliness had to be crossed before an equally isolated telegraph
station on the overland line was reached.</p>

<p>Many tales were told of this half-known area. The pituri plant
grew there, and the natives who inhabited the country were said
to be of a pugnacious and warlike disposition. There were tales,
too, of an ancient white man living with the natives, who, on the
authority of a noted western weaver of romances, was supposed to
be Classen, a survivor of the lost party of Leichhardt.</p>

<p>But the two men, Grace and Strong, who had invested their
slender capital in taking up and stocking the country, thought
more of wet and dry seasons than of what romance might possibly
exist outside their own domain. One day Grace was up the creek
after some missing horses, when he came on to some travelling
blacks camped on a waterhole some eight miles from the station.
By means of the black boy he had with him, he found out that they
had just made in from the dry pituri country, the spring they had
been camping at having given out unexpectedly. They were tall,
gaunt men, all wearing their hair in a picturesque knot on top of
the head, and each with his plug of prepared pituri carried
behind the ear, a chew of which was politely offered to Grace,
who managed to evade the offer without giving offence.</p>

<p>While trying to get some Information from them regarding the
waters to the westward by means of his own boy, who could
slightly understand them, they were startled by a loud, wailing
cry from the crest of the ridge facing the creek.</p>

<p>The blacks jumped up, grasping their weapons as they did so.
Grace, anticipating treachery, drew his revolver, and stood
ready; but no harm was intended. The cry was repeated, the blacks
answered it, and some of them went in the direction of the
sound.</p>

<p>''Nother feller come up,' said the boy. Grace waited, and a
group of natives presently appeared, slowly approaching. As they
drew nearer, it could be seen that they were either supporting or
carrying one amongst them. Evidently the call had been for
assistance. When they came to the camp they were helping an aged
blackfellow, white-haired and white-bearded. His rheumy eyes
seemed blinded with the glare of the mid-day sun, and he blinked
at the white man with unresponsive gaze as the latter stooped
over him.</p>

<p>Apparently he was a very old man, of a once tall and burly
make, now gaunt and attenuated; evidently he had lived beyond the
usual span of a native's life, and was slowly dying of extreme
old age. Remembering the idle tales of an ancient European
amongst the natives, Grace examined him attentively, but there
was no sign of white blood in him.</p>

<p>After some water and food (the latter given him by Grace, some
which he had brought with him for a mid-day meal), the old man
revived somewhat; but Grace's boy was unable to find out why the
blacks bestowed on him such care and attention, for it was
unusual amongst them. Finding that they were going to remain a
few days at the waterhole, he told them that he would return the
next day, and rode home.</p>

<p>'It's deuced queer,' he said to his partner, when they were
discussing the matter, 'but those niggers must have had a fine
old contract getting that man across the dry stage; they were
regularly dead beat when they sung out for the others to come and
help them on. I wonder that they didn't knock him on the
head!'</p>

<p>'Yes; they're not generally so considerate, although more so
than they are usually given credit for.'</p>

<p>'Come up with me to-morrow. We'll take old Yackandando up with
us. He can yabber to these fellows better than any of them.'
Strong agreed, and the next morning, accompanied by the black
professor of tongues, they rode up to the aborigines' camp with a
few presents.</p>

<p>The ancient native was much better, and after distributing
what they had brought they told Yackandando to try and find out
why he was so well looked after.</p>

<p>The reason turned out to be simple, enough. He had a knack of
preparing the pituri in a way peculiar to himself, converting the
plant into a strong and potent drug, that was much better than
that prepared in the ordinary way. In fact, according to the
natives, the old man was of an enormous age, and had survived in
consequence of the power of the plant on his system.</p>

<p>'I've often meant to try some of the staff,' said Grace.</p>

<p>'I wonder whether the old boy will make me some up, they're
sure to have some of the dry pituri with them.'</p>

<p>'If I were you I wouldn't watch the preparation, at any rate,'
replied Strong.</p>

<p>Grace made his request, which was conveyed to the old man, who
seemed somewhat agitated when it was explained to him. He wanted
to see Grace close, and looked long at him with his dim eyes.
Then he said something that the others interpreted, that he would
make him a dose that would cause him to steep and dream. That he
would have it to-morrow, and that one of the natives would take
it in to the station.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the plug of fermented pituri duly arrived,
enclosed in a wisp of grass.</p>

<p>Grace postponed taking it until bedtime, then, according to
instructions, vigorously chewed the unsavory-looking quid for
some ten minutes, then he spat it out and got into his bunk.</p>

<p>Strong, who had been laughing at him, lay awake some time
longer, reading, before putting the primitive slush lamp out, he
looked at his partner. Grace was sleeping soundly and
peacefully.</p>

<p>'A good opiate, after all,' said Strong, as he extinguished
the light.</p>

<p><br>
THERE was a fearful row going on somewhere, thought Grace, as
he wearily opened his eyes; but it was only imagination, for the
most complete silence reigned around. Gradually, as his senses
fully returned, he found that he was in the open air; that he was
stiff, sore and in pain; moreover, he was lying on the deck of a
ship that was rolling slightly, and that other forms were
stretched around him. With great exertion he raised his head, but
no lights could be seen, no movement was visible. The sails were
set, and the vessel speeding through the water; that was all he
could make out before unconsciousness again overtook him.</p>

<p>When he once more opened his eyes he was still lying on the
deck, with the same dread silence around; but now the dawn was
breaking, and the light grew fast.</p>

<p>What a strange old ship it was! The sails that were set were
rent and torn, and the deck was broken and bloody. Men, dead and
wounded, in strange dresses, were lying prone, and others were
moving about. But the moving ones made no noise, the masts and
cordage did not creak, even the wind that blew and filled the
sails was dumb.</p>

<p>Making an effort, Grace got to his feet, and propped himself
against the high bulwark, but his own movements were noiseless.
He now could see all along the deck, which was flush. At the
stern were gathered a knot of men dressed in a fashion of more
than a hundred and fifty years ago. Two, who seemed to be of the
highest rank, wore knee breeches, long-skirted coats, and
three-cornered hats. The other men were roughly dressed, some
with sea-boots, some barefooted; many had bloody clouts about
their heads and limbs. All were armed with cutlasses, long
pistols, and pikes.</p>

<p>As the daylight spread fast, Grace could see their lips move
as though angrily speaking, but not a word reached him; all was
dumb-show. They were looking eagerly astern, and following their
gaze he saw a ship there evidently pursuing them. Even as he
looked a puff of white smoke burst from her bows, and there was a
splash astern. His attention was attracted to the flag fluttering
at their peak. It was black, and on it was a grim white skull and
cross bones.</p>

<p>The Jolly Roger!</p>

<p>He was on board a pirate craft, chased by a King's ship, but
of what nation he could not determine. He glanced at himself, and
then noticed his own dress. Not only was he on board a pirate
ship, but he was one himself, an officer of some sort; for his
dress was rich like the two men astern. His left arm was useless,
and his neck was stiff from a cut on the shoulder; there was a
movement near him, though soundless, as all things were on that
strange old ship.</p>

<p>A woman's head appeared out of the hatchway, and presently she
ascended and stepped on deck. She looked at the men astern, then
around her, and smiled at Grace. Looking at her he thought he had
never seen such a wonderfully beautiful face, although pale and
worn as if with fatigue. She waved her hand to him and went below
again, only to re-appear with a long glass tankard, filled with
wine, which she brought over to him.</p>

<p>He took it gratefully and drank, feeling new life course
through his veins as he did so; then he handed it back to her,
trying to express his thanks; but his voice had no sound. The
woman took the tankard and Grace noticed what a white hand she
had, and the rich jewels that sparkled on her fingers. Just then
the men at the stern came forward, their attention having
evidently been called to something in sight ahead.</p>

<p>The two officers spoke to him as though asking how he felt,
but though his lips answered the silence was unbroken. The woman
spoke to one of the two, and he came and examined his wounds.
Meanwhile the silent chase continued; but the ship behind did not
gain, and their bans still fell short. A black line was now
plainly visible ahead, and towards it the vessel was steadily
kept. The firing astern was increased, but without result, and
the black line soon developed into a belt of mangrove trees.</p>

<p>More appeared, and gradually it was evident they were
approaching a wide shore, where the pirates hoped to find shelter
from their pursuer. On the two vessels kept before a freshening
breeze, the pirate captain anxiously examining the dense bank of
mangrove forest into which they appeared to be driving. Suddenly
he pointed to something ahead and drew his companions' attention
to it; then they went aft again. The woman came and stood beside
Grace, leaning against the bulwark.</p>

<p>She spoke to him, and he answered her, but what they both said
he knew not; some inner power forced him to speak words of which
he was ignorant She turned and looked back at the pursuing
vessel, without evincing fear or dislike; indifference seemed the
prevailing feeling, only when she looked at Grace her eyes wore a
look of kindness and affection.</p>

<p>What relationship could possibly exist between them?</p>

<p>All this time the vessel was rapidly nearing the mangroves in
which an inlet was now visible. Into this their course was
directed, one of the sailors up in the top seemingly conning her
as she passed into a fair-sized channel, up which the tide was
running strong. They turned a point, and before them was a fairly
straight reach of water. Each side was nothing tout the dreary
mangroves, here and there broken by little sandy plains, and
silently they kept on their dream-like course. Suddenly the men
at the stern seemed highly elated, and exchanged looks of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The cause was apparent. Over the mangrove point they had
lately rounded could be seen the topmasts of the King's ship, but
stationary. She had struck on a mud bank. The end of the long,
straight reach terminated In another expanse running at a
different angle, but at the end was a ridge, higher, than the
mangroves; beyond which ridge the inlet they were in did not
appear to be navigable.</p>

<p>At this rocky point they anchored, a boat was lowered, and the
captain and some men went ashore. Up to this Grace had been a
passive spectator, but he now found himself moving, stiffly
about; and giving inaudible orders, or, rather the spirit
controlling him was urging him on to act so. Whether by his
orders, or by those of the captain, the ship was being put in a
complete state of defence, as a boat attack was seemingly
expected. The captain soon returned, and began speaking to the
woman, who refused whatever request he was making, which appeared
to be that she should go on shore during the approaching
fight.</p>

<p>There was not much time to argue, as three boats soon appeared
rounding the point They came swiftly on, and when within shot one
on board held up a white flag, and the boat bearing it pulled
ahead of the rest. An officer, richly dressed, but with a face of
fierce passion, stood up in the stern and a parley ensued. It
evidently had reference to the woman, who stood boldly out, and
joined in.</p>

<p>The parley was fruitless, and Grace guessed that peace was
offered if the woman was surrendered. The boat pulled back to the
others, the officer shaking his sword hilt at the pirates as he
left. The white flag was hauled down, and a desperate attack was
made. Twice were they beaten back; the third time the assault was
renewed, the officer who had held the parley storming and raging
as he urged them on. Grace had found himself taking an active
part in the defence; now he snatched a clumsy musket from a
sailor and fired at the officer, who fell backwards, over the
side of the boat. The attacking party halted, and then retreated.
As the pirates were rejoicing, Grace felt a hand on his arm and
beside him stood the woman. She looked at him out of her deep,
dark eyes with a look of both affection and pity, and leaned her
head on his shoulder; then seemingly recovered herself, and,
putting her hands on his cheeks, drew his face down and kissed
him.</p>

<p>The pirate captain stood near, and when she released his face,
he took his hand and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>An anxious conference was held, and the boat with the other
officer went away up the narrow channel of the river. Meanwhile
the vessel was warped near the shore, and the work of unloading
commenced. Stores, arms, and ammunition were taken out, and
conveyed across the ridge, Grace finding himself superintending
matters as though he had issued the orders. The boat returned,
and the work went on all night; before daylight the ship was
deserted and they all proceeded across the ridge. On the crest
the Captain halted, and they remained there until day broke. Then
a column of smoke was rising from the ship, and round the point
came again the boats, now with carronades mounted in them.</p>

<p>Evidently this was what the pirates had expected; seeing that
the boats could lay off and pound them to pieces, they had fired
the ship. When the men in the boats saw that the ship was ablaze
they ceased pulling, and lay on their oars watching the fire.
Presently, in obedience, to an order, the boats' heads were
turned, and they returned round the point. The pirate company
waited until the vessel burnt to the water's edge, then they
marched to the place where then stores were placed.</p>

<p>Grace found this to be by the side of a lagoon of fresh water
round which grew the weeping tea-trees of the north, telling him
that he was in Australia. Shelters were soon erected from spare
sails, and there they remained while the wounded recovered
somewhat. How many days it was Grace could not tell, all was so
vague and dreamy now that the fight was over, only he remembered
how he, the captain, the other officer, and the lady met one day,
and the captain produced a paper.</p>

<p>Then Grace knew what the dumb ghosts of the past could not
tell him. The lady was his sister, the man whose body lay in the
salt water estuary, the prey of sharks and crocodiles, was her
husband. The captain of the pirate vessel was her old lover, with
whom, assisted by her brother, she had fled from her husband's
cruelty and tyranny. Outlawed by the King of France, they had
sailed for the French settlements in India, but were pursued
there by the husband, who was of high rank. Hoisting the black
flag in defiance, they sailed for the Eastern Archipelago, but
were doggedly followed up by the Sire de Bricheneuil, in a King's
ship. From island to island, and sea to sea, the chase continued,
until at last the pirate craft turned and fought. But the King's
ship was the strongest, and once more they flew south to the
unknown <i>'terre Australe</i>.'</p>

<p>Again an encounter took place, and then the rest that was
related Grace had witnessed. To it was added that the ship had
been burnt on an unknown land, and the survivors intended to make
inland, thinking that in this vast country there must be
civilised people who might shelter them. The document was buried,
enclosed in a powder case, at the foot of one of the giant
tea-trees.</p>

<p>Then all things grew dim and strange. Visions, misty and
obscure, of the party falling, off one by one; of barren ranges,
of sun scorched plains, of hostile natives. But always that
beautiful woman was with them, until at last they stood together
alone, for the faithful lover and his men were dead by the way.
They were on a ridge that appeared strangely familiar to him.
Around were dusky savages who seemed friendly, and the worn and
faded lips, that still smiled on him, formed the last words,
'Good bye.'</p>

<p>So she died, and they buried her by the side of a mighty
granite rock, in the ragged dress that still clung to her, and on
her fingers the jewels and gold she wore. On her lonely grave
they piled stones, as heavy as they could bring, and raised a
mound.</p>

<p>Grace knew no more.</p>

<p><br>
'HOW did the pituri work, old man?' asked Strong.</p>

<p>'Let me think a little,' replied Grace, looking at him
somewhat dazedly. Strong remained silent; presently Grace got out
of his bunk, and, going to the table; sat down and commenced to
write. When he had finished he told his friend of his vision.</p>

<p>'I believe I know that ridge well, and I'm going there to dig
that grave up,' he concluded.</p>

<p>Strong had listened, interested In spite of the disclaimer
that was on his lips, but when his comrade had finished he agreed
to go with him and investigate, only commenting that after a
hundred and fifty years or more, there would not be much left to
be found.</p>

<p>'But I tell you,' cried Grace, vehemently, 'that we put stones
beneath her, and bark above her, and on the bark heavy stones.
They would not decay, man.'</p>

<p>He spoke as though it had all been actual reality, but strong
took no notice of this.</p>

<p>'We'll put it off until to-morrow. After going to the Gulf of
Carpentaria and back last night, you must need a rest,' he
said.</p>

<p>The following morning they started, equipped for the task.
They went by way of the camp where the natives were, and both got
off, as Grace wanted to see the old man.</p>

<p>The venerable old aboriginal looked hard at him as he
approached, then spoke in his own tongue, which Yackandando, who
had again accompanied them, translated to mean if the pituri had
made him sleep. He answered that it had.</p>

<p>A strange light of intelligence came into his wrinkled face,
and he spoke as follows, according to a free translation of the
station boy's interpretation:</p>

<p>'You seek her whom you have seen. She is buried at the great
rock.' He raised his voice. 'Urillalo!' he called to one of his
tribe, 'guide them to the hill of the white dead.' He closed his
eyes and sank back.</p>

<p>Remounting, and now accompanied by the native named, Grace and
Strong proceeded on their way. That night they reached the hill,
or ridge, and camped there. Next morning, Grace was up by the
earliest dawn, and, with the vision of the rude burial still
fresh in his memory, he had no difficulty In recognising the
mound, now overgrown by grass and bushes.</p>

<p>Setting to work, they soon rolled the stones aside, and opened
the shallow grave. When they came to the layer of stones they
lifted them reverently. The bark and the body had long mingled in
undistinguishable mould, but in fancy Grace still saw the
beautiful worn face, as he had kissed it in his sleep. And on the
breast, where the hands had been piously folded, flashed the
gemmed rings the unhappy Frenchwoman had worn.</p>

<p><br>
THE partners sold their station to advantage soon afterwards,
and men wondered at the wild extravagance that had made them
erect an iron railing around a heap of stones, and a stone cross
at the mound's head, afar on a lonely ridge away back from the
creek.</p>

<p>One old blackfellow knew, and when death at last claimed him
his tribe buried him at the 'Hill of the White Dead.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>13. &mdash; THE STORY OF A BOTTLE</h2>

<h3>A MESSAGE FROM THE SEA</h3>

<h3><i>Adelaide Observer</i>, 30 Jul 1881</h3>

<p class="first">
Published as by "Dramingo," Favenc's most common pseudonym,
this is an example of his verse. A single volume of verse was
published in his lifetime.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
I was born&mdash;well, I scarce remember, now,<br>

For 'twas many a year ago,<br>

But I know 'twas deep in a furnace fierce,<br>

In the midst of its heat and glow.</p>

<p class="verse">
And I passed my youth with some hundreds more<br>

In a cellar's cool retreat,<br>

Where always I heard the incessant hum<br>

Of the busy neighbouring street.</p>

<p class="verse">
And then my turn came: I was carried forth<br>

Away up a noisy stair.<br>

Till I stood in a room where a revel raged<br>

'Neath the gaslights' brilliant glare.</p>

<p class="verse">
My time was short&mdash;from hand to hand<br>

I passed, then I left the scene.<br>

I was trundled out as a worthless thing:<br>

I was only a "dead marine."</p>

<p class="verse">
For weeks I was left, and then once again<br>

Did the rich wine wet my lip;<br>

I was filled to the brim, I was corked and sealed,<br>

And carried on board a ship.</p>

<p class="verse">
I have said, 'twas a feast when I first saw the light.<br>

Where the air was mild and warm;<br>

But when next I was opened, 'twas in the night.<br>

In the midst of a raging storm.</p>

<p class="verse">
Ah! the wine I had cherished was wasted then,<br>

I&mdash;the bottle&mdash;was valued more;<br>

For perchance I might live when they all were dead,<br>

And carry a message ashore.</p>

<p class="verse">
And one man wrote with a trembling hand,<br>

Arm-linked round a swaying rope,<br>

The name of the ship, the date, and then,<br>

"God help us all. No hope."</p>

<p class="verse">
I scarce can tell how it passed; I know<br>

I was thrown far out to the lee,<br>

I saw for one instant the reeling deck,<br>

And the next&mdash;was alone at sea.</p>

<p class="verse">
How many suns I watched rise and set<br>

As I idly tossed afloat,<br>

I cannot say, but one calm hot day<br>

I drifted against a boat.</p>

<p class="verse">
A boat, that rocked as idly as I,<br>

Nor heeded my clinking touch,<br>

'Till I heard a sound, and a man stooped down.<br>

And seized me with greedy clutch.</p>

<p class="verse">
With a shout of joy he held me high<br>

The sun and his eyes between&mdash;<br>

A man did I call him? My God! no man&mdash;<br>

'Twas a phantom, gaunt and lean.</p>

<p class="verse">
And the crew that sailed in that dreadful craft,<br>

Five rotting bodies lay,<br>

Sun-blistered, scorched, with their wide dead eyes<br>

Upturned to the light of day.</p>

<p class="verse">
And that lone survivor held me long:<br>

How his fierce wild eyes did shine<br>

With rage, when he saw I a message held,<br>

And not what he hoped for&mdash;wine.</p>

<p class="verse">
But it passed, and he put me gently back<br>

In the smooth still sea once more,<br>

And the boat and I went drifting along,<br>

Silently as before.</p>

<p class="verse">
Silently! Silently! through the night,<br>

No sound but the plashing wave;<br>

Just once, at midnight, I heard a voice<br>

Calling on God to save.</p>

<p class="verse">
But God heeded not; at least I know,<br>

When the coming sun's red stain<br>

Was bright in the east, the boat was gone,<br>

And I was alone again.</p>

<p class="verse">
'Twas a summer morn, and across the sea<br>

A soft wind gently sighed,<br>

When I floated into a rocky pool.<br>

And was left by the ebbing tide.</p>

<p class="verse">
I was found and handled by man once more,<br>

Before many an hour had passed.<br>

I was shattered in bits on a neighbouring rock&mdash;<br>

My message was told at last.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>14. &mdash; A ROMANCE OF KANGAROO POINT</h2>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, Aug 1876 (in three parts)</h3>

<h3>1. &mdash; O MY PROPHETIC SOUL! MY UNCLE!</h3>

<p class="first">
MY name is Mervington Smythers. I was born in London, but have
not had the inestimable advantage of in any way profiting by my
short residence in that centre of civilisation, being only some
four years old when my parents landed in Sydney.</p>

<p>My father was a gentleman, living upon his income, as the term
goes. I did not then know whence this income was derived: I do
now. All I knew then was: that as far as my mother and I were
concerned it seemed a very inadequate sort of income, although
adapted to keep my father in good clothes, hansom cabs, the best
cigars, and private delicacies for his own eating, when not
dining out anywhere, which, however, was generally the case; for
being a man endowed with great social talents he was in request
at other people's tables&mdash;and he always preferred them to
his own.</p>

<p>My mother was pale, quiet, and had evidently been very pretty.
She never went out any-where, was devoted to my father and me:
the only two objects, in fact, that she lived for; and we bullied
her. She educated me herself, and as I was a sharp boy, and she
had received a more liberal education than most women get, I
think I did as well, or better, than I would have done at
school.</p>

<p>As I grew up and turned out a gentlemanly-looking lad, with
good taste in dress and not so much gawkishness about me as a boy
between fourteen and fifteen usually possesses, my father began
to take more notice of me, and gradually I became his companion
and pupil, and my mother was left entirely to herself. Finding, I
suppose, that her influence was gone, and that she was of no
further use in this world, the gentle little soul died; and I
must confess that as far as regarded my personal comfort I missed
her very much.</p>

<p>My father was a man essentially formed for society. Out of it,
in the solitude of his own home, he was&mdash;truth compels me to
write it&mdash;an unmitigated brute. He was always talking about
his family: how he had offended them by his
marriage&mdash;allying the blood of a Mervington Smythers with
that of an Amberly, my mother's maiden name. We had a coat of
arms which I studied assiduously, and believed in implicitly, as
I did in a legend my father used to relate of it having been
granted to an ancestor of his for prowess displayed at Chevy
Chase. I used to quote as peculiarly appropriate:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
These are the arms that once did turn<br>

The tide of fight at Otterbourne.</p>

<br>

<p>My father used always to speak of my mother's relations in the
most contemptuous manner; and from all I could gather I came to
the conclusion that they were low people engaged in trade, and
utterly below the notice of a Mervington Smythers, unless perhaps
it might be honoring them by accepting their money. Against a
brother of my mother's he was particularly fierce in inveighing,
accusing him of rolling in wealth (an action I have often heard
of but never seen performed), and leaving his relatives to
starve.</p>

<p>My mother's death having removed what little check there was
on my father, he took to drinking so constantly that in about
three years' time he followed my mother to the grave, leaving me
as a sole legacy his mantle of good looks and suave manner.</p>

<p>A gentleman of the name of Vaughan, whom I had seen visit my
mother once or twice, came to see me, and attended my father's
funeral. He then informed me that he had it in charge, on behalf
of my mother's brother, to allow me the sum of £100 yearly until
I was in a position to dispense with such assistance. He also
told me that through the influence of some friends in Brisbane he
could obtain for me an appointment in the Civil Service in that
colony, and by steadiness and application I might in time rise. I
had an idea that Brisbane was a half-civilised sort of place
where Mervington Smythers would shine a star of the first
magnitude; so accepted the offer and expressed my readiness to
depart at once. My temporary guardian asked me if I had no
enquiries to make concerning my mother's people, who were now my
only relations. But my father's son replied in the negative,
loftily and decidedly.</p>

<p>"You have no objection to the hundred a year Amberly will
allow you?" he then asked.</p>

<p>Of course I had not.</p>

<p>I asked about my father's family, but he professed total
ignorance concerning that point, in a tone almost as lofty as my
own, and we parted rather coolly.</p>

<p>I had been in Brisbane about four years when the incident I am
about to relate took place.</p>

<p>I had remained, and had risen, in the same department that I
had first entered, and considered that my position in Brisbane
society was a tolerably good one; not quite what my merits
deserved, but still improving. I need not say that my companions
in the office were all men of family, at least they all said that
they were, and we made it a point of pretending to believe each
other. At my instigation we had early formed a coalition to keep
out cads, and any who did find their way into the office were
glad to get removed again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>My principal friends were Snobleigh Johnstone, my rival in
dress, deportment, and lady-killing; Tarquin Staggers, our wit,
who gave the nicknames and did the sarcastic; De Joinville
Peenopes, the poet, great (in his own opinion) at album verses
and elegant epigrams; and Vermont Brussels, who studied family
history and heraldry.</p>

<p>We all resided in a boarding-house situated on Kangaroo Point,
and considered&mdash;or rather regarded&mdash;ourselves as the
only worthy bearers of Civil appointments out of London. We
studied Trollope, and modelled ourselves upon some of his
characters, assuming an air of lofty hauteur towards the general
public that we fancied rather good style.</p>

<p>Now if there was one person to whom I was partly indebted for
my position in the upper strata of Brisbane society it was Mrs.
Memphis. She had known my father in his best Sydney days&mdash;he
was great at fascinating middle-aged women, and she was
middle-aged in his time and always spoke of him as that
delightful man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis took me up when I first came to Brisbane, and
excepting that she seemed to regard me as private property, to be
entirely at her commands, I had no objection to being patronised
by a lady of her standing.</p>

<p>The worst of it was, though, that Aurelia Sphinx, her niece,
who resided with her, also seemed to consider me in the light of
private property, and this I decidedly objected to.</p>

<p>We used to have very pleasant little parties on the Point in
those days, there being some very nice girls in our set.</p>

<p>There was Bessie de Boys, called Bessie Doughboy amongst
ourselves. Vermont Brussels, who was born in Brisbane, and knows
everything about everybody, says that the paternal Patrick
Doughboy kept a small public-house in the outskirts of the town,
and having made a fortune by some lucky speculations, changed his
name to Dubois, and came out, or rather the younger branches did.
The old couple were not presentable as one of the "first
families." However, in the course of her boarding-school
education in Melbourne, Bessie discovered that Dubois was not
considered a very aristocratic name in sunny France. Therefore,
in a most ingenious manner, and with an utter disregard of the
science of nomenclature, "Dubois" became "De Boys," and as de
Boys they shone in our select circle. Bessie was given to dog
French. Tarquin Staggers used to compare her to a page of one of
Ouida's novels.</p>

<p>Aurelia Sphinx, I have already mentioned; her <i>forté</i>
was the intensely respectable, in which she resembled her
aunt, who was the incarnation of gentility.</p>

<p>Sophy Montcalm, who essayed the fast line, and indulged in
slang, and Georgey Widrington, who gushed, make up the sum of all
I need mention for the purpose of illustrating my story. Of the
many friends of my father who had invited him to their tables for
the sake of his convivial talents, none had shown the slightest
interest in my fate or fortunes. My father had been proud of my
good looks and appearance during the last years of his life, had
been in the habit of introducing me to his friends, and saying,
apropos of myself, "A chip of the old stem, blood must
tell&mdash;as old a pedigree as anybody in the kingdom that boy
can boast of." And I did boast of it, but am not aware that I
derived any benefit beyond self-gratification by so doing.
Consequently I now looked upon Brisbane as my settled home, and
had lost all connection with my past life in Sydney, save the
business one of receiving £25 quarterly from Vaughan.</p>

<p>I was beginning to think seriously of taking unto myself a
wife, and thereby adding to my worldly importance and
respectability, but was waiting for another step in promotion,
and had not quite decided where to throw my handkerchief.</p>

<p>Aurelia Sphinx, I knew, looked upon me as booked, but so did
not I, for she was ten years my senior if she was a day. Bessie
de Boys was good-looking, good-tempered, and often sat out a
dance with me. But truth to tell there was another <i>"faire
ladye"</i> whose gray eyes had cast a spell over me. I did not
mention her amongst the bevy of demoiselles already cited, for in
fact she was not altogether one of our set. Even Tarquin Staggers
had not dared to invest her with a sobriquet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vane was by some called everything that was charming, and
by others voted "stuck-up" and exclusive, and her daughter Clara
shared both verdicts. I was never quite sure myself as to my own
opinion.</p>

<p>Sometimes when freely ventilating my opinions in her presence
as to the absurd pretensions of some people to be considered
anything else but cads, I could detect a smile of amused contempt
flicker over her regular features, and a cool look come into the
great gray eyes that made me feel that she understood and
appreciated me thoroughly. Then I thought her odious. But again,
when in her own house, her perfect manner so entirely set you at
ease, her soft voice seemed so modulated to nothing but tones of
courtesy and kindness, that then she appeared to me the most
witching piece of womanhood I had ever seen. But she was an only
child; her mother had a secure little fortune which Clara would
inherit, and that anchored my drifting fancy.</p>

<p>This, then, was my position when I received a letter that
rather frightened me. It ran thus:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear nephew</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
I hear from Vaughan that you are getting on steadily and well
in the profession you have chosen to adopt. I am about starting
to India on important business, and as I shall have some leisure
time at my disposal when it is settled, I intend returning to
England by way of Australia and America. I shall call at Brisbane
en route, and will then see you.</p>

<p class="letter">
By the way, there is a graceless young friend of mine on a
cattle station somewhere in Queensland: his name is Fred. Conway;
try and find him out and make his acquaintance. I have written to
him and expect he will come to Brisbane to see me. I should like
you to be friends.</p>

<p class="letter">
I hope to arrive in Brisbane by the mail boat leaving
Singapore in October next, and trust that I shall find in you
something to remind me of my sister.</p>

<p class="letter">I am</p>

<p class="letter">Your affectionate uncle,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Ralph Amberly</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>The reader may think that there was nothing in this proposed
visit of a wealthy uncle to cause a clerk in
the &mdash;&mdash; department, with £100 a year besides his screw
to feel frightened, but so it was.</p>

<p>As I have said before, I always imagined that my mother was
the daughter of some wealthy tradesman whom (my mother, not the
trades-man) my father had married for her pretty face. I had
shunned asking Vaughan if it were so, for fear of his confirming
it; and it was now as fixed an article of my belief as was the
greatness of my father's family&mdash;though both were equally
vague and misty deductions. Another belief was strong within me:
namely, that Ralph Amberly, my maternal uncle, and R. Amberly,
maker of "Amberly's celebrated Suffolk sauce," <i>vide</i>
advertisements, were one and the same person.</p>

<p>Now I had so bored my friends with histories of the Mervington
Smythers' family, so blown my own heraldic trumpet, that should
my uncle turn out a mere maker of Suffolk sauce, whose name in
glaring colors was in any grocer's window, I was lost beyond
redemption. My rising sun of borrowed gentility would set in
clouds of ridicule.</p>

<p>I was troubled in mind, the more so as I found that, in
consequence of the mail having been delayed a fortnight, another
fortnight would land my uncle on the shores of Queensland: brief
breathing time in which to decide on a course of action. I
re-read the letter, and then thought about looking up this
Conway. Perhaps he was already in Brisbane. If so where should I
find him? Where did bush fellows generally stay when in town?
There were two or three places where I would enquire on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Chance favored me the next day. At the first hotel where I
enquired the waiter told me that a Mr. Conway was staying there.
Was he at home? The waiter took my card and went to see;
presently he returned and ushered me up-stairs to a private
sitting-room.</p>

<p>A young fellow about my own age, sunburnt, and bearded, was
lying on a sofa, reading. His heels were higher than his head,
his coat was off, he was smoking a short clay pipe, and on the
floor, within reach of his hand, were a large tumbler of iced
claret and water and a palm leaf fan.</p>

<p>He sprang up as I entered, and greeted me in an open cordial
manner, if somewhat eccentric.</p>

<p>"It's frightful weather for the time of year, is it not? You
look hot; sit down and take your coat off, and have some iced
claret. Here, take a couple of chairs in front of the
window&mdash;you'll get a little draft there. The men who built
such houses for a climate like this want crucifying, don't
they?"</p>

<p>I accepted one chair and some claret, but declined to take my
coat off. In fact I felt hurt at being told that I looked
hot&mdash;I, Mervington Smythers, who prided myself on never
looking hot.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to make your acquaintance," went on my new friend;
"your uncle has been a second father to me. You don't know him
personally, I believe."</p>

<p>I said "No," and we drifted on to the common topics of the
day, and I found Conway not half so bucolic as I had anticipated.
For I always had fought shy of bush fellows, imagined they were
always talking about riding buck-jumpers, and insisting on
"shouting" for you.</p>

<p>I did not draw him out about my uncle at first, for I thought
that I could find out what I wanted to know better when I knew
more of my new acquaintance. Presently Conway looked at his watch
as I rose to go. "You live at Kangaroo Point, and as you say you
can't stop to dine with me to-day" (the dinner invitation should
have come, from me, but I wasn't quite sure about him at first),
"I'll go over the river with you, and give a call I have to make
over there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I know your friends," I said. "I know most of the
people over there."</p>

<p>"O very likely. Mrs. Vane; she was an old friend of my
mother's."</p>

<p>"I know them well," I replied, "and will go with you. I owe a
call there."</p>

<p>"I saw them once when I first came to the colony, three years
ago, but have never been in Brisbane since. Excuse me half a
minute."</p>

<p>My companion returned almost within the half minute, not
having changed the light gray coat he wore, or donned anything
more imposing than a common straw hat.</p>

<p>I suppose I was guilty of looking rather critically at his
dress, and then at my own faultless and accurate get-up, for he
glanced enquiringly at me but said nothing. At any rate, I
thought he is calling on his own responsibility; I am not
introducing him. But I had to admit that although his dress did
not accord with my strict notions of the proper thing, he looked
well in it. As we walked down the street we talked about my
uncle.</p>

<p>"Is he much given to talking shop?" I asked, nervously
approaching the dreadful subject.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth he is a little given to it, but not so much
as most men who have made their mark."</p>

<p>"This sort of thing," I said, with a sickly smile, indicating
a flaming placard in a window, setting forth the merits of
"Amberly's Suffolk Sauce."</p>

<p>My companion looked me in the face with a puzzled expression
of countenance. Suddenly a light seemed to dawn upon his mind,
and he burst into a fit of ungovernable laughter.</p>

<p>"Don't!" I said; "pray remember that we are in the main
street," and I glanced apprehensively around.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul it's too rich," he said amid renewed
merriment.</p>

<p>"What is? what is?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I will tell you directly," he replied.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," he went on when he had attained command of
his facial muscles, "how happily you had hit your uncle's
character. That sort of thing is his hobby. Once get him started
on the merits of his incomparable sauce and he will hold forth
for any length of time."</p>

<p>"But," I asked, "does he mention it amongst his friends apart
from business?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly! His motto is, advertise every-where. At a dinner
party, for instance, he will say: 'I see you use my sauce; now if
you want to save, order it directly from the manufactory. Come!
give me an order now, and I'll book it and make you the usual
trade allowance.'"</p>

<p>This was awful; my worst fears had never pictured anything so
bad as this.</p>

<p>"He carries little handbills," my companion went on, "and
distributes them to everyone he is introduced to. He has often
given me a lot to take to a ball or party."</p>

<p>"And did you take them?"</p>

<p>"Well you see he is such a fine-hearted old fellow in the
main, and has been such a good friend to me that I couldn't
refuse. He will make you laugh in spite of yourself. He thinks
nothing of going up to a young lady, thrusting a handbill into
her hand, and saying, 'There, my dear, when you get
married&mdash;and that's sure to be soon, with a pretty face like
yours&mdash;you buy plenty of my sauce, and you'll find your
husband come home to his dinner as regular as clockwork.'"</p>

<p>Whatever should I do? Ask for leave of absence, and fly the
country for a time? Impossible! I had just had a holiday.</p>

<p>My companion did not see, or did not heed, my disquietude, for
he harped on the subject still.</p>

<p>"But his grandest point of all is telling how he first got the
recipe for the ingredients of which the sauce is composed. He
always commences in the same words; I have heard him tell it a
score of times, and know directly it's coming. He begins: 'Now
I'll tell you how I once got the better of a Jew.'"</p>

<p>Conway, doubtless, guessed why I was so silent and subdued,
for after a short pause he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But you must not imagine that he is always like this.
Sometimes he can be most correct in his behaviour, but never for
long, it's only acting a part."</p>

<p>This was a feeble ray of hope. Perhaps I could induce him to
act a part all the time he stayed in Brisbane. An idea, a glimmer
of salvation began to form in the troubled chaos of my mind. We
reached the house where Mrs. Vane lived, and I was rather
surprised to see that my companion's <i>negligé</i> costume
brought no censuring look into Clara's face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vane was delighted to see Conway, and I felt vexed at
noting the interest Clara displayed in his conversation. Had it
been possible for a visitor at their house to feel himself out in
the cold, I should have felt so that afternoon despite the warmth
of the weather.</p>

<p>But my annoyance was capped when Mrs. Vane asked Conway if he
did not think Clara altered since they last met. Actually asking
him&mdash;for it amounted to nothing else, I thought, in my
vexation&mdash;to look at and admire her daughter's blooming
beauty.</p>

<p>I was supposed just then to be engaged looking over some
music, searching for a song I had asked permission to borrow, but
could not resist stealing a glance at Miss Vane to see how she
took it.</p>

<p>To my disgust she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"If I am much altered, Mr. Conway is altered too, since we
used to romp together."</p>

<p>"Don't remind me how old I am getting," said Mrs. Vane, and as
I came forward with the sought-for song the conversation at once
changed, and we shortly afterwards left.</p>

<p>"I suppose you saw a good deal of the Vanes when you first
came out?" I said carelessly, as we strolled away.</p>

<p>"No, very little," he replied, "I only stayed a few days in
Brisbane, and went straight up the bush where I have been ever
since."</p>

<p>This was worse and worse; putting Clara down at nineteen, and
deducting the three years my companion had been out in the
colony, she would have been sixteen when they used to romp
together. The idea was terrible&mdash;worse than my uncle's
visit. The calm Clara Vane, the type of maidenly reserve and
womanly propriety, romping at the age of sixteen with a young man
she scarcely knew. After this the deluge!</p>

<p>"I knew them long ago in England," said my companion at this
point of my meditations.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is where you used to romp together," I exclaimed,
unguardedly showing what my thoughts had been.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, with the slightest elevation of his
eyebrows. "Did you imagine it was out here? When I was a boy at
school I used to spend half my holidays at their house."</p>

<p>I felt relieved, and Clara was back on her old pedestal
again.</p>

<p>I saw my new friend down to the ferry, and promised to dine
with him on the next day.</p>

<p>As I walked back to my lodgings I mused deeply upon the best
way of combining two apparently antagonistic courses of
action&mdash;namely, the best mode of presenting my uncle to my
friends without endangering my presumed reputation for good
family, and yet keeping carefully in his favor, so as not to
forfeit my chance of obtaining a monetary acknowledgement of the
tie of relationship existing between us. Had he been poor and
vulgar of course I would have at once ignored the relationship;
but rich and vulgar&mdash;that was a horse of another color.</p>

<p>I could not quite understand how it came about that Conway and
my uncle were so intimate. Conway was evidently well-bred, and a
gentleman, if somewhat careless of appearance, and yet he seemed
to have been on a perfectly familiar footing with my uncle.</p>

<p>Still what he said was explicit enough, and reliable, and upon
his utterances I built my plan of action.</p>

<p>My uncle intended coming out by way of India, where doubtless
his business was establishing an agency for the sauce. He could
act the part of a gentleman when he liked, so Conway said. I
would introduce him as a distinguished Indian officer, and
persuade him to carry out the deception. In all probability he
had picked up enough Indian slang to carry it off, and would feel
flattered at the notion.</p>

<p>The more I turned the idea over in my mind the better I liked
it, and determining to strike while the notion was hot I
mentioned it to my friends that evening.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, I expect my uncle out by the next E. and A.
mail," I said.</p>

<p>"Who is he&mdash;Lord Helpus?" said Staggers, who could be
very low in his jokes when he liked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied loftily, "Colonel Amberly, of whom you would
have heard before if you knew anything about India."</p>

<p>"Why, what did he do?" asked Snobleigh.</p>

<p>"Distinguished himself greatly at the Pass of Juggernhaut," I
answered confidently. It was the first word I could think of, but
it did for Snobleigh.</p>

<p>"What happened there?" he grunted.</p>

<p>"My uncle and a handful of his men captured a khitmugar full
of wild elephants."</p>

<p>"What!" said Staggers, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"A khitmugar full of wild elephants," I repeated undauntedly,
"and let them loose upon the infuriated rebels. Yes! let them all
loose upon the exasperated rebels."</p>

<p>My audience were deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"I remember the affair now," said Snobleigh, slowly; "a
relation of mine was present at the engagement."</p>

<p>Now this was so evidently fiction, invented on the spot, that
I determined to put it down at once.</p>

<p>"What was his name?" I asked. "Oh&mdash;Johnstone," he
replied.</p>

<p>"I heard my uncle speak of him," I said.</p>

<p>"Very likely; he distinguished himself greatly there."</p>

<p>"He did," I said, "he ran away."</p>

<p>This turned the laugh against Johnstone, and so far I was
triumphant.</p>

<p>The next day I dined <i>tête-à-téte</i> with Conway, and
confided to him my Indian-officer-plan. He seemed delighted at
the idea, said it would be the greatest joke out, and promised to
use all his influence to induce my uncle to consent.</p>

<p>"But he'll break out sometimes you know," he remarked, "but
we must manage so that it only occurs when we are alone."</p>

<p>"I hear you expect your uncle shortly," said Miss de Boys to
me a few days after this.</p>

<p>"Yes, in a week or so," I replied.</p>

<p>"An old Indian officer, is he not?&mdash;a <i>vieux</i>
moustache. I know I shall like him. Is he <i>décoré</i>?"</p>

<p>I was slightly at fault for an answer; her questions were so
warm.</p>

<p>"The interest you display is most flattering, Miss de Boys," I
said evasively.</p>

<p>"Really now; but it is a selfish interest, for I find I can
get on so much better with people who have lived in society at
home."</p>

<p>"I wish I had lived in society at home then," I said
pathetically.</p>

<p>"You have quite the air of it," returned Bessie, graciously;
"quite the <i>bel air</i>."</p>

<p>Now was not this too bad, to be approved and passed by a girl
who had worn shoes and stockings only since she was ten years
old, and the family greatness dawned. Bessie might have known
that I knew what the amount of her experience had been. But that
was the worst of our little set: we all tried to impose upon one
another so. Could I look into my own heart and say that I was
guiltless.</p>

<p>"I trust he will resemble your poor father," said Mrs.
Memphis. "I never," she went on, turning to Aurelia Sphinx,
"knew anybody who combined graceful wit with an easy polished
manner, so delightfully."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt, I think I have heard you say that before."</p>

<p>"If you have, my dear Aurelia, it is because such talents are
not so noticeable amongst the people of the present day. I trust
we shall, however, find the same happy combination in your uncle,
Mr. Smythers."</p>

<p>I could only bow, and hope so too, most fervently.</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to know your uncle," said Mrs. Vane.</p>

<p>"And from Mr. Conway's description I am quite prepared to fall
in love with him," added Clara.</p>

<p>"Most Indian men dance well," said the Montcalm; "I hope he
goes fast."</p>

<p>I politely reminded her that my uncle's dancing days were
probably over.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I'll flirt with him; I like flirting with old men
better than young ones&mdash;they are not so conceited."</p>

<p>"That is a very cruel remark, considering to whom it is
addressed, Miss Montcalm."</p>

<p>Now this was all very encouraging; but how would it be if this
<i>décoré</i>, this man who was to combine polished wit with an
easy manner; with whom quiet Clara Vane was ready to fall in
love; and Sophy Montcalm to get up a flirtation&mdash;if he
should thrust handbills upon them setting forth the superlative
merits of his Suffolk sauce.</p>

<p>I used to have terrible nightmares, in which I was about to be
married to Mrs. Memphis, and when about to produce the ring would
find a bottle of sauce in my hand; whereupon she would change
into a wild elephant and chase me round the church.</p>

<p>However there was nothing for it but to await the fullness of
time. I had set my all upon a cast, and had to stand the hazard
of the die.</p>

<h3>2. &mdash; MY UNCLE ARRIVES</h3>

<p class="first">
THE day big with my fate arrived, and found Conway and I on
board of the Kate, steaming down to the Bay to meet the E. and A.
steamer <i>Singapore</i>.</p>

<p>Conway pointed out my uncle amongst the passengers, watching
our approach, and I felt one weight off my mind: in appearance he
was quite presentable.</p>

<p>We went on board, and Conway introduced me. My uncle perused
my face earnestly, but seemed disappointed in what he found
then.</p>

<p>"Too like his father," I overheard him say to Conway. I could
quite understand that he bore my father no good will, and did not
feel hurt at his tracing a resemblance I was rather proud of. On
our way up the river my uncle seemed anxious to draw me out; and,
nothing loath, I dilated to him in glowing terms upon the good
standing I had achieved in the best Brisbane circles&mdash;I who
had come then a lonely stranger; and although he several times
asked me most earnestly about my mother, I always managed to get
back to my own affairs again.</p>

<p>It did not strike me that even a manufacturer of Suffolk sauce
may have loved his sister, and have been anxious to hear one word
at least of affectionate remembrance from the lips of her only
son. If that was his wish, it was not gratified. He seemed
pained, and I thought Conway, who was sitting near, but not
joining in the conversation, looked a trifle disgusted.</p>

<p>What astonished me, and also pleased me, was that my uncle, in
manners and appearance, was such a contrast to what I had
expected. Iron-gray moustache and whiskers, short-cut hair, and a
manly, bronzed face, with a noticeable scar on the
cheek,&mdash;why he was, in effect, the very character I had
selected for him. Then was a slight twinkle in the eye that
betokened a keen appreciation of humor, and a very set expression
about the mouth that made me think that he would not be so easily
led as I had fondly imagined. Still I hoped for the best; perhaps
he would remain on his good behaviour of his own accord; he might
have altered since Conway knew him.</p>

<p>As we neared Brisbane, my uncle took Conway's arm,&mdash;for
whom he seemed to have a great affection,&mdash;and they
commenced to walk the deck together. After a few turns, I saw my
uncle's face change, and a look of deep wrath cross it; I could
see before that he could look black when he liked; something that
Conway said, however, immediately altered the expression into one
of mirth, and for the rest of their walk he seemed scarcely able
to suppress his merriment.</p>

<p>Conway had taken a room for my uncle in the same hotel when he
was stopping, and we sat down to dinner in the private room when
I had first met Conway. The moment we were seated I noticed a
change in my uncle's manner&mdash;even in his face. Conway had
whispered to me: "I never saw him keep straight so long before,"
therefore I was partly prepared for it. The first thing my uncle
did was to throw off his coat and waistcoat, and, sinking down in
a chair, to wipe his perspiring forehead with a table napkin.</p>

<p>"Pheugh!" he said; "Why don't you have punkahs here?"</p>

<p>I admitted that it would be an improvement.</p>

<p>Conway sat down opposite to me, having thrown off his coat and
nodded to me to do the same. However, I would not. I thought that
I could impress my uncle more by strictly adhering to the rules
of society, than by meekly imitating his whims. Conway, I now
saw, was a mere toady.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said my uncle, "it's nice to get together, where
a man can enjoy himself, free and easy like, same as I've always
been accustomed to."</p>

<p>"Have you any Suffolk sauce?" he demanded of the waiter,
before commencing to eat his soup.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man, handing him the cruet-stand. This
was the first time that I had heard the dreaded word from his
lips, and it made me shudder. My uncle selected the bottle
indicated, re-moved the stopper, and smelt it suspiciously. He
put it back without using any, and sternly told the waiter to
bring him the real Suffolk sauce.</p>

<p>"That's Suffolk sauce, sir," said the waiter.</p>

<p>"It's not!" said my uncle, so savagely, that the poor man
jumped again. "Send out directly, and buy a bottle. None genuine
unless signed 'R. Amberly.' That's my name, d'ye see; and if a
man isn't to know his own sauce, I'm a Dutchman. Now look
sharp."</p>

<p>The man left the room, and in a much shorter time than I had
expected, returned with a newly purchased bottle in a paper
wrapper. I had gone on steadily eating my soup.</p>

<p>Conway leaned back in his chair, silent, and staring at the
gas.</p>

<p>My uncle unbuttoned his shirt collar, and fanned himself with
a napkin. He signified his approval of the fresh bottle; he and
Conway put some in their soup, and they commenced their dinner.
As the waiter was removing the plates, my uncle carefully
unfolded the printed wrapper around the bottle of sauce, and
handed it to Conway.</p>

<p>"Read it out to me, Fred," he said, drawing another chair up
to rest one leg on; "seems long since I've heard it."</p>

<p>Conway commenced; and fancy what I had to suffer, knowing the
waiter was grinning behind me, as he told how it was patronised
by the nobility and gentry of England, sought after by foreign
cooks, and used by missionaries to propitiate the heathen, and
teach them to appreciate civilisation.</p>

<p>My uncle would grunt approval, and repeat what were evidently
his pet passages after the reader.</p>

<p>"Imparting a truly delicate and delicious flavor to
everything," he said, as Conway ceased; and with a satisfied sigh
he returned to his dinner.</p>

<p>"He's rather worse than usual," Conway whispered to me after
dinner; "he's been cramped on board the mail steamer, and now
he's giving full fling. But don't look so disgusted. He says
you're stuck-up; don't let him think that."</p>

<p>"Have you said anything about the Indian officer scheme?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I just mentioned it, and he seemed to like the idea. I'll
sound him again to-night."</p>

<p>I left about ten o'clock, although my uncle wanted me to take
a room at the hotel during his stay in Brisbane; but for several
reasons I declined this arrangement.</p>

<p>As I emerged into the street I heard their voices in
conversation on the balcony above, where they were smoking, and
heard Conway say, "Yes, but don't overdo it."</p>

<p>I therefore concluded that he was explaining to my uncle our
proposed line of conduct. I had promised to dine with my uncle
every day during his stay in Brisbane; and used to go to the
hotel immediately after office hours, for I was determined that
if I had to put up with his vulgar ways, I would at least
endeavor to get a substantial recognition of our relationship
from him in return, and not leave it altogether to Conway to
entertain him.</p>

<p>One day, as I entered the sitting-room (in, I confess, a
rather unceremonious manner), I found a gentleman there whom I
knew by sight, and whose acquaintance I had often
coveted,&mdash;Major Milton. He was just taking his leave of
Conway as I entered; my uncle was not there. As I apologised to
Conway, Major Milton said, in his off-hand manner, "This is
Amberly's nephew, I suppose?" and shook hands with me.</p>

<p>"Of course he's a dancing man; and Mrs. Milton will want to
get up a dance after dinner; so I hope you are not engaged for
to-morrow," he went on addressing me, and nodding to both of us,
he left the room.</p>

<p>"You know Major Milton?" I said to Conway, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Never saw him before," said Conway: "but he and my father
were brother officers."</p>

<p>"We must try and keep my uncle within bounds then," I said;
"for Major Milton was a long time in India, so a mistake would be
fatal; besides, they are the best people on the Point."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Conway, indifferently; "but here comes your
uncle."</p>

<p>I told my uncle, as he entered, of the invitation to dinner at
Major Milton's, and how necessary caution would be; for his
assumption of the part of an Indian officer had now become openly
recognised amongst us.</p>

<p>"All right, Neddy," (I hated this name) he said, "I'm fly.
We'll put out company manners on Fred."</p>

<p>The next day I was very nervous. Staggers and Johnstone told
me that they were invited to a carpet dance in the evening, and I
crowed over them at having a dinner invitation. This was a slight
source of satisfaction.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Major's we found only Mrs. Vane and her
daughter there, and Bessie de Boys, who had come under Mrs.
Vane's chaperonage. Conway, to my disgust, took Clara in to
dinner; I followed with Bessie, and I could scarcely help looking
nervously behind me to see if my uncle was thrusting hand-bills
into Mrs. Milton's hand as they brought up the rear. But his
manner was simply perfection, and I could scarcely believe him to
be the same man.</p>

<p>What with watching him, and casting furtive glances at Clara
Vane and Conway, I am afraid Bessie found me a not very brilliant
dinner-companion. So long as the ladies remained at table India
was not mentioned, but at soon as they left I could see that
Major Milton was eager for the fray.</p>

<p>"You knew Dick Featherstone&mdash;hard-riding Dick?" he asked
of my uncle. "Did you hear what had become of him as you came out
this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's married."</p>

<p>"Married, is he? Whom did he marry?"</p>

<p>"You knew Bowker?" said my uncle; and I stared at him, lost in
amazement at his cool audacity. How I longed to repeat Conway's
caution&mdash;"Don't overdo it."</p>

<p>"Knew Bowker? Of course I did. Why, didn't Mrs. Bowker get out
a daughter regularly every year? and Dick christened them 'the
annuals.' You don't mean to say he married an 'annual?'" and he
went off into a fit of laughter, in which my uncle joined.</p>

<p>"That's the best thing I've heard for a long time," said Major
Milton, "Why, when the supply of daughters ran out, she used to
get out nieces! Dick married a niece. I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said my uncle. "Fancy hard-riding Dick married to an
'annual!' He used to get up sweeps, write down 'Julia,' 'Maude,'
'Alice' etc., on slips of paper, and when the expected one
arrived, who-ever had drawn her name took the rupees. Dick
doesn't ride steeple-chases now, I'll be bound," said Major
Milton. "But," he went on, turning to Conway and me, "I expect
there's metal more attractive for you youngsters in the drawing
room, so don't let us keep you here, listening to our old Indian
yarns; we've got a lot of old battles to fight over yet."</p>

<p>Conway nodded, and, laughing pleasantly, rose and left the
room. I kept my seat, anxious to see how far my uncle's assurance
would carry him.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what had become of Tom Frost? What a hand he had
for a devil's sauce!"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned my uncle; "and speaking of sauce, I will tell
you how I once got the better of a Jew."</p>

<p>Here was a collapse. I could not see it out.</p>

<p>Hastily swallowing my wine, I rose and followed Conway. In the
drawing-room, Mesdames Milton and Vane were deep in some matron's
talk. Clara Vane and Conway were inspecting a photographic album
together, and Bessie de Boys, looking very lonely, by herself,
with a book in her lap. Bessie seemed unfeignedly glad to see me,
and made room for me beside her on the ottoman with alacrity.</p>

<p>"What a delightful man your uncle is!" she said. "Just what I
expected; quite one of the old regime."</p>

<p>What Bessie knew of the old "regeem," as she called it, I
don't know; but as I thought of the disclosures being made at
that moment in the dining-room by a member of that body I groaned
in spirit.</p>

<p>"How <i>triste</i> you are," said she giving me a playful tap
with her fan; "quite distrait. What is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>I borrowed the fan&mdash;for I was in that nervous state when
it is a relief for a man to have some-thing to trifle
with&mdash;and tried to rouse myself.</p>

<p>"It is excusable in me, Miss de Boys; for you know what
Shakespeare says about lovers."</p>

<p>"No; what does he say? Oh! I know; something about being 'sans
eyes, sans ears, sans everything;' and certainly it would apply
to you very well just now."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; but I don't think you exactly remembered the
quotation I meant."</p>

<p>"No! But never mind; tell me who you are in love with," she
said, confidentially.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;with myself, I think," I replied evasively. Bessie
was such a girl for home questions.</p>

<p>"I certainly think you are," she said, rather pettishly.</p>

<p>At this moment a servant entered, and spoke to Mrs. Milton,
who then left the room. What had happened? Was my uncle to be
forcibly ejected as an impostor? and was I to follow? I looked
towards Conway, but he seemed quite engrossed with Miss Vane, and
had no eyes for me.</p>

<p>"There you are&mdash;looking at Miss Vane and Mr. Conway
again! I declare you have been watching her ever since you came
in," said Bessie.</p>

<p>Just then, Mrs. Memphis, Aurelia, and the Montcalm made their
appearance, and a diversion was caused. Immediately following
them, Mrs. Milton re-entered, and came directly towards me.
Without stopping to consider the wild absurdity of her mentioning
the fact, then and there, even if my uncle had "served by
indenture to the common hangman," I awaited her approach with
trepidation.</p>

<p>What a relief it was when she said:</p>

<p>"Your uncle and Major Milton are so deep in old Indian
recollections that they are going to have their coffee on the
verandah, and we need not expect to see them here. Now will you
and Mr. Conway help to move the tables back, to make room to
dance, and I'll play for you."</p>

<p>"All hands clear decks!" said Miss Montcalm, who had been to a
dance on board of a man-of-war once; and Conway and I set about
our appointed task, assisted by Staggers and John-stone, who came
in.</p>

<p>I spent a very pleasant evening. Miss Vane danced twice with
me for the first time in our acquaintance; and in other quarters
I did what England is popularly supposed to expect every man to
do. As my uncle did not come into the drawing room, I had not an
opportunity of presenting him to Mrs. Memphis.</p>

<p>Major Milton walked down with him and Conway to the ferry
before the last dance; and I had the inexpressible pleasure of
being sole escort to Mrs. Vane and her daughter for the short
distance that separated their home from the Miltons'
residence.</p>

<p>It was a day or two after the dinner at Major Milton's that I
was strolling up from the ferry, on my way home, when I saw three
ladies walking ahead of me. There was no mistaking the graceful
figure of the one who was my then object of adoration&mdash;Clara
Vane. Equally recognisable to my acute eyes were the other
two&mdash;Mrs. Memphis and Aurelia Sphinx. They had doubtless
been shopping on the north side, and were on their way home.</p>

<p>Carefully avoiding all appearance of haste, I yet managed to
quicken my steps so as to overtake them. I was well received, and
graciously allowed to accompany them.</p>

<p>As we turned the corner two figures appeared approaching us,
coming down the main street; my uncle and Conway. The first-named
had his hat in one hand and his handkerchief in the other, and
ever and anon fanned himself with the first-named article of
attire. He had broken out again, I could see at a glance, an
affectation of feeling the heat very much being a sure sign. I
trembled. The meeting could not be avoided; it was inevitable. On
they came.</p>

<p>"Is not that Mr. Conway?" said Mrs. Memphis. "Who can that be
with him?"</p>

<p>She would know too soon. They met us directly, in front. I
thought I saw a look of suppressed fun on Clara's face as she
acknowledged Conway's salutation, but certainly did not feel very
happy myself.</p>

<p>My uncle stopped short, managing somehow to check us as well,
and, with a smile of bland benevolence beaming all over his face,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, Neddy, boy; enjoying yourself! Trotting some swell
girls out for a walk?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis looked&mdash;but words adequate to express her
look fail me&mdash;a petrified personification of outraged
gentility. Aurelia regarded my uncle with a stare as stony as her
namesake's; and Miss Vane fairly laughed out. My uncle turned to
her.</p>

<p>"I think I know you, Missey," he said, taking her extended
hand, and shaking it as if it were election time, and she a
candidate. "Well, Fred," he went on, "as we've nothing better to
do, suppose we see Neddy through."</p>

<p>What could I do? I&mdash;who prided myself on always
introducing the right people at the right time&mdash;had now to
present my uncle to Mrs. Memphis, in the middle of the street.
There was no help for it.</p>

<p>My uncle insinuated himself between Mrs. Memphis and Aurelia
Sphinx. Conway and I followed, as supporters to Miss Vane; and in
this order we resumed our interrupted way. I could hear every
word of the conversation going on in front, for in our trio
reigned a deathly silence.</p>

<p>"You see, marm," said my uncle, addressing Mrs. Memphis, "when
people arrive at our time of life" (I could fancy the Memphian
visage at this remark, although I could not see it) "it's only
right and proper we should indulge the young ones a little. Don't
you think so, Miss?" turning to Aurelia.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," she replied, in a voice like a
file.</p>

<p>"No! Now what I mean is this: A man like me, who has had to
work his own way,&mdash;why it does me good to see young folks
enjoying themselves in a way I never got the chance of."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Memphis. "Yes, marm; you wouldn't think
it, to see me now, selling my sauce in every part of the world,
by the ton, I may say: but I began life with nothing but my
pay."</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis snorted; I can use no other expression for the
sound she emitted.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've made a tidy little fortune, and Neddy's my only
nephew; so I like to see him kicking up his heels amongst the
nobs a bit."</p>

<p>The voice of Mrs. Memphis seemed to take a softer intonation
as she said: "I presume that yours is a lucrative profession, Mr.
Amberly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'm, a money-making business, and I always push it;
that's my motto. Now, a lady like you ain't above saving a few
shillings; and why should you be? say I. Then why don't you buy
your sauce direct?&mdash;that's what I say. Give me an order
direct, and I'll make a reduction."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Amberly, I do not use it in sufficient quantities
to warrant me in doing so."</p>

<p>"Never mind the quantity; say a dozen only. I'm not above
booking an order for a dozen."</p>

<p>"What a fortunate thing it is," said Mrs. Memphis, evading the
order question, "for Mr. Smythers to have an uncle of your
wealth; not all young men enjoy that advantage."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's lucky for Neddy, and he'll do me credit; he's had
the advantage of good society;" and my uncle bowed, so as to
point the compliment.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Amberly," she returned, with quite an agreeable
smile, "I have always taken a great interest in your nephew. I
knew his father."</p>

<p>"And so did I," and my uncle's voice seemed to alter as he
said it.</p>

<p>"A delightful man," went on Mrs. Memphis, who, to my wonder
and complete amazement seemed emerging from a frigid into almost
a torrid zone; "and Mr. Smythers inherits many of his
qualities."</p>

<p>"He does," said my uncle in the same altered voice.</p>

<p>"And will, I suppose, have the additional advantage of
inheriting something more from other quarters," she said in a
gushing manner, put on doubtless to cover the left-sidedness of
her remark, for my inheritance would necessarily be contingent on
my uncle's decease.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'm," returned my uncle in his former manner, "money
made from sauce is as good as any other money, and every penny
that I've made from the sale of sauce Neddy shall get, take my
word for it."</p>

<p>"But your essay in trade is only an affair of late years. I
understood that you had served&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I did, for many a long year, and got but very little
wages."</p>

<p>"Served her Majesty, I mean, Mr. Amberly."</p>

<p>"O yes&mdash;I was special constable at the time of the
Chartist riots."</p>

<p>At this moment we arrived at the Memphian abode, and my
uncle's unlucky reminiscences were fortunately cut short. Both
Mrs. Memphis and Aurelia bade him farewell in a most effusive
manner; and I was fairly puzzled.</p>

<p>My uncle walked off with Miss Vane, and Conway and I strolled
leisurely back to the ferry, my uncle saying he would overtake us
as soon as he had seen his fair charge safely home.</p>

<p>Conway and I said but little as we walked along. I was
wondering what had caused Mrs. Memphis to thaw in so remarkable a
manner. Could it be the worship of the golden calf, and if so,
what did it matter to her whether my uncle were rich or poor?</p>

<p><br>
"QUITE original, but charming for that very originality," said
Mrs. Memphis the next day, for I found a pretext for calling in
order to hear her opinion of my relative.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aurelia, regarding me with dangerous fondness;
"there is something fresh and striking about these self-made men
that, although perhaps not so agreeable at first sight as a more
polished manner, has still its fascination."</p>

<p>"Be sure you do not allow him or Mr. Conway to engage
themselves anywhere to-morrow night," said Mrs. Memphis. There
was to be a small dance at the Memphian establishment. "My
limited income," Mrs. Memphis would say, "does not allow me to
give entertainments on the scale I once did;" so her dances were
small, but select, O very select.</p>

<p>My uncle came, and was on his beat behavior. The sauce affair
had somehow leaked out, and Staggers and Johnstone had already
commenced some sly chaff; but as yet they were not sure of their
ground, and my uncle's appearance at Mrs. Memphis' rather awed
them.</p>

<p>"Fine-looking old boy," I heard Johnstone say.</p>

<p>The night was wearing on. I had just handed Miss Vane to a
seat when Conway appeared. "I believe I am to have the pleasure
of your hand for the next dance, Miss Vane?"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Fred," said my uncle's voice behind me; "I am
going to induce Miss Vane to dance with me instead of you."</p>

<p>"I did not know you danced, Mr. Amberly," said she.</p>

<p>"I have not danced for&mdash;really I don't know how long; and
upon my word I think the last time was with you, when you were
about as high as the back of the chair upon which you are
sitting. But to-night, for once, I am going to break through my
resolution in your favor; and if you don't consent I shall do
something desperate."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Amberly, to avert such a catastrophe, I will break
my word as you have broken yours, and Mr. Conway will excuse
me."</p>

<p>"I excuse you, Miss Vane. I shall follow the example of the
individual who hung his harp on a willow tree."</p>

<p>"And what did he do?" asked Clara, as she handed him her
bouquet and fan.</p>

<p>"He said, or sung&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
I will hide in my heart every selfish care;<br>
I will flush my pale cheek with wine;&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>"Let me finish the quotation," said my uncle.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Amberly, I will excuse you," said Clara, hastily. But
he was not to be baulked&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"And when smiles await on the bridal pair,<br>

I will hasten to give them mine."</p>

<p><br>
And Miss Vane went off with a very pretty bloom upon her round
cheek. Did I really catch a hesitating, timid glance in my
direction as she tried to stop my uncle, or was it only fancy?
No, not fancy, I felt sure of it, and was proportionately elated;
so much so that I condescendingly offered to relieve Conway of
Miss Vane's bouquet, but he said&mdash;"Never mind, my dear
fellow, I don't want to dance; and there's Miss de Boys looking
at you as though she expected you to ask her."</p>

<p>Poor Bessie, I really had flirted with her a good deal, and
perhaps the little girl thought I meant something; so in the
kindly disposition I was then in, I went and asked her to
dance&mdash;a favor she kindly granted. As I composed myself to
sleep that morning, I could not help thinking what a clever
fellow I was. I felt sure that Miss Vane had what Bessie would
call a penchant for me. I had heard my uncle say that every penny
of the sauce money should be mine.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to have remembered that I had announced my uncle
as an Indian officer who had served with distinction, and he had
announced himself as a sauce-maker. Doubtless my agreeable
company was too highly valued for people to risk losing it by
touching on the subject. My last thought was that Mervington
Smythers was as talented an individual as one could find in
Queensland, and, so thinking, I slept.</p>

<h3>3. &mdash; MY UNCLE DEPARTS</h3>

<p class="first">
MY elation had not cooled when I awoke. My course ahead seemed
fair and clear.</p>

<p>At the office I experienced some slight annoyance. Staggers
and Johnstone conversed over my head on the merits of the
celebrated Suffolk sauce; Staggers had procured an advertisement
of it, and read it aloud at intervals during the day, Johnstone
and the others making critical remarks during the process.</p>

<p>I stood the chaff pretty well, but found it very annoying. I
mentioned it to Conway that evening, and he gave me a piece of
advice; he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If they try it on again, just state that the first man who
says anything about Suffolk sauce in your hearing, intentionally
to annoy you, had better accompany you into the handiest backyard
and there repeat it."</p>

<p>I tried it the next morning; Johnstone had bought a bottle of
sauce, and produced it in an ostentatious manner on arrival. I
immediately invited him to try the ordeal by battle, as proposed
by Conway, and to my great relief he declined. We shook hands all
round, and concluded to drop the subject.</p>

<p>"You know I would have fought you in a minute, old fellow,"
said Johnstone, "but I'm engaged for a picnic next week, and I
was afraid of getting a black eye."</p>

<p>"Suppose you have it out afterwards," said Staggers. "I don't
mind picking one of you up." But we said "No;" the matter was
done with, it was absurd to start it again.</p>

<p>I went with my uncle to call on Mrs. Memphis a day or two
after this. Aurelia in her sportive manner told me to come and
help her to get some flowers, and with no great delight I obeyed
her. While engaged in the floral occupation, Aurelia had some
mysterious message brought to her by a servant&mdash;something
about a dress-maker I thought I heard.</p>

<p>"I know I can dispense with ceremony with you, Mervington, we
are such old friends," she said; "so make up the flowers nicely,
and I will be back directly."</p>

<p>She skipped away in an airy manner, and fervently wishing that
her return might be delayed till the crack of doom, I bundled the
flowers together and went back to the house.</p>

<p>My uncle and Mrs. Memphis were sitting at the open window,
talking. I could hear their voices although I could not see them,
and hearing my own name, instinctively halted. I suppose I ought
not to confess what I did, but the story would be incomplete
without it, so, in fact, I stopped and listened.</p>

<p>"Quite an affair of the heart," said Mrs. Memphis; "Mervington
will be so much steadier, and in Aurelia, he will find everything
he could hope for in a wife."</p>

<p>"She seems a most amiable girl," said my uncle.</p>

<p>"She is amiability itself; during the years she has grown up
under my eye, such sweet unselfishness as she displays has been
my wonder and admiration!"</p>

<p>"It will be a trial to part with her."</p>

<p>"Indeed it will; no shadow of a quarrel has ever marred our
intercourse." (they used to fight like two cats before me
sometimes).</p>

<p>"And you think Mervington will propose to her soon?"</p>

<p>"He worships her; but the timidity of true love is so great
that he hesitates to speak. Now, if you hinted to him that such a
union would be most agreeable to you it would give him courage;
he would gain sufficient courage to test his fate."</p>

<p>"He has my best wishes, and if a word of encouragement is
needed he shall have that too."</p>

<p>"Then my dear Mr. Amberly we can look upon it as a settled
thing, for a dutiful nephew like Mervington will be only too
eager to hasten to please a generous uncle."</p>

<p>"I think it a suitable match in every respect provided that
the young people" (Aurelia young!) "come to an understanding
before I leave the colony."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Amberly, although not given to match-making, in fact
holding it in contempt, still standing as I do in a mother's
place towards Aurelia, I can take upon myself to say that an
opportunity shall be afforded for the needful explanations
between them. Perhaps it is even now taking place," and she
laughed girlishly, or as girlishly as a woman of sixty could.</p>

<p>I had heard enough; too much. I stole a few paces away, and
then came back humming a tune. As we took our leave Mrs. Memphis
gave my uncle a meaning glance that made me turn cold, and
rendered me moody and silent until I was alone.</p>

<p>Now, what shall I do, I mused. Marry Amelia, and take my
uncle's money? Yes, as a last resource; but if I can avoid
it&mdash;no. Could I give up the idea of Miss Vane so
readily?</p>

<p>Ah! a bright idea! My uncle had evidently a great liking for
Clara; quite a paternal fondness. Would he not be as much, or
more, pleased if I married her than if I married Aurelia? Of
course he would. What did he mean by saying that his smiles would
await on the bridal pair, unless he meant me to, what is
popularly known as, "go in and win."</p>

<p>But I would consult Conway; he knew my uncle well, and could
tell me what would be my best course: only the more I thought of
Aurelia's faded fascinations, and compared them with Miss Vane's
blooming freshness, the more did I feel averse to sacrificing
myself, unless for a good consideration.</p>

<p>I invited Conway to a stroll and a cigar after dinner; we
sauntered along a lonely street, and I explained what had passed,
and asked his advice.</p>

<p>"My advice is that you tell your uncle that you have no more
idea of marrying Miss Sphinx than you have of flying."</p>

<p>"But my uncle seemed to like the idea of the match; and he
told Mrs. Memphis that every penny he had made by the sale of
sauce should be mine. He might change his mind if I refused to
marry Miss Sphinx."</p>

<p>"Everybody asks advice, but nobody takes it. I have given you
mine, and I know your uncle well. Go straight to him, and tell
him that there is nothing between you and Miss Sphinx. Don't
listen to conversations not intended for you again; and take my
word for it, every penny of the sauce money will still be
yours."</p>

<p>Perhaps Conway was right, but I could not make up my mind to
follow his counsel. I preferred acting with more caution. I would
sound my uncle on the subject I fancied myself rather skilful at
diplomacy, and never doubted but what I could find out what I
wanted without committing myself. I did not reckon on the wiles
of women.</p>

<p>Next morning a dainty note from Aurelia Sphinx informed me
that her aunt had told her to write to me, and tell me that she
(her aunt) had something important to say to me, if I would call
that afternoon. Knowing what I knew, I looked upon the letter as
an invitation from the spider to the fly; but mentally feeling
that they had a very knowing fly to deal with, I went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis was alone. Aurelia was not visible. My esteemed
friend was made up for the part of an invalid. She was carefully
arranged on the sofa, with shawls, smelling salts, and all other
paraphernalia. She told me to bring my chair close, as she could
not speak loud.</p>

<p>"My dear Mervington, as an old friend of your father's I can
speak to you as freely as I would to my own son. Do not excite me
by expressing emotion at what I am going to tell you, but for my
sake be calm. You know the wretched state of health I have been
in for the last few years. My troubles will soon be over. Last
night Dr. Killall informed me that a crisis was approaching that
would almost certainly prove fatal."</p>

<p>I expressed the tendered sympathy, in a way compatible with
not exciting an invalid in such a dangerous state.</p>

<p>"But it is not for myself I feel sad," she resumed, in a tone
of plaintive melancholy; "I hail with joy the prospect of release
from mundane sorrows. It is for others that I grieve; for one
other, I might say," (here her voice was broken by sobs) "who,
unfitted to buffet with the world&mdash;with the cold, unfeeling
world&mdash;will, on my death, find herself once more an
orphan."</p>

<p>I tried to assure Mrs. Memphis that there was still room for
much hope; it was, no good anticipating death; she might&mdash;I
trusted would&mdash;live many years yet.</p>

<p>But she shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"No, Mervington, the inward voice that never lies tells me
otherwise You and Aurelia are the only two beings left for me to
love; and you, I thank Heaven, have now no cause to dread the
future. Secure in your uncle's favor, you can anticipate at no
distant date becoming a very wealthy man: but my poor Aurelia!
Promise me, Mervington," she cried, raising herself on one arm,
as though inspired with new strength for the occasion, "promise
me that you will not let me die in such painful uncertainty; that
you will" (hysterical gasps and sobs) "watch over her" (sob)
"shield her" (gasp), "and protect her&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;"
(I made sure she was going to say sister, and in my eagerness to
recognise such a safe relationship, and end the scene, cried out,
"I understand&mdash;I will!")&mdash;"your wife!" shrieked Mrs.
Memphis, sinking back, exhausted and fainting.</p>

<p>"Wife!" echoed Aurelia, appearing with the suddenness of a
harlequin, and falling on my neck with a shock that staggered
me.</p>

<p>"O Mervington," she murmured, "you have saved aunt's life, and
made your poor Aurelia so happy."</p>

<p>"Leave me now, dear children," said Mrs. Memphis, faintly.
"Put my bible near me, and after I have read a little, perhaps I
may be able to sleep." We left her. I left the house in the most
awful state of semi-lunacy I have ever experienced. I locked
myself in my room, and pondered on my future course.</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis would tell my uncle that all was happily settled;
he would express satisfaction, and I would have to go up a
willing victim. If I showed any repugnance to the match, my uncle
would be justly offended at my want of stability of purpose. He
would never learn how I had been fooled. And Clara Vane was lost
to me for ever! As this fact became patent to me, I for the first
time felt that I loved her for herself.</p>

<p>Had I but followed Conway's advice, all would have been well;
and as I thought that, a glimmer of hope came to me that he might
still be able to show me a way out of my difficulty. I would seek
him and see. I had eaten no dinner, having been lying sulkily on
my bed, thinking of all that had passed, but my appetite was
gone, and without stopping to take any-thing, I hurried down to
the ferry to go over to North Brisbane to look up Conway.</p>

<p>As I stepped on the landing stage, Conway himself appeared
leaving the boat.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to?" I asked. He looked a little
surprised at my abrupt question, but answered that he was going
to spend the evening at Mrs. Vane's.</p>

<p>"Can you spare me half-an-hour?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, if it is very important," he replied. I hurried him
away, and told him what had happened since last I consulted
him.</p>

<p>"And have you not yet seen," said my companion, "that your
uncle is no more a manufacturer of Suffolk sauce than I am?"</p>

<p>"Not the sole proprietor of the celebrated Suffolk sauce!" I
exclaimed, in my astonishment, quoting from the too-familiar
advertisement. "Who, then, is he?"</p>

<p>"You gave him brevet rank when you announced him to your
friends as Colonel Amberly, for he was only Captain Amberly when
he left the army; but at present he is a simple country
gentleman, and owner by inheritance of a fine estate in the south
of England."</p>

<p>Although my strong sense of family pride was agreeably tickled
by this announcement, still the blow to my discriminating talents
was great.</p>

<p>"Then," I said, rather stiffly, "what is the meaning of the
farce that has been carried out in order to deceive me?"</p>

<p>"You deceived yourself. If you remember, you were the
originator of the idea. It so amused me&mdash;the imaginary
picture you had conjured up of your relative&mdash;that I could
not resist drawing a fancy portrait on your foundation. I
persuaded your uncle to continue the deception, and he, in his
strong love of a joke (his only failing, if it be one),
consented. I owe you an apology for my share in it, which I now
make. As for your uncle, when you remember the way in which you
were prepared to condescendingly patronise a man whose purse has
supported you since your birth, you must admit that the revenge
he took was slight."</p>

<p>"He could well promise me all the money he had made by the
sale of sauce," I said bitterly. My companion turned on me quite
fiercely.</p>

<p>"A characteristic remark from your father's son," he said.
"Shall I tell you why your uncle and I are so intimate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like," I answered, ungraciously.</p>

<p>"It will teach you to appreciate him better, perhaps."</p>

<p>We had reached the side of the river, and Conway stopped, and,
leaning against a post of an abandoned landing stage, spoke as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father and your uncle were friends at school&mdash;fast
friends. Your grandfather was a country rector; his only children
your uncle and mother. My father and your uncle entered the army
together. Both had scarcely anything but their pay. Their
friendship was close and constant, until an event happened which
happens to most men&mdash;they fell in love. Unhappily, they were
rivals. My father was the successful one, and your uncle went to
India. As you may guess, the old tie of friendship was broken,
although they never quarrelled. It was whilst your uncle was in
India that your father and mother were married. While he was
still out there your grandfather and his elder brother died
within a short time of each other, and your uncle became
possessor of the estate he still enjoys. On receipt of the news
he started for England, intending to leave the army. He hardly
reached Calcutta when the mutiny blazed out; and of course he
turned back. My father was on his way out at the time, and at
Delhi they met again. I will tell you how.</p>

<p>"It was one of the unsuccessful attacks made during the siege,
and a small party of our men had been nearly cut to pieces. Your
uncle came up with a handful of fresh men to cover the retreat,
which was a very leisurely one, in spite of their loss.</p>

<p>"'By Jove! there's one of our fellows cut off!' said one of
the officers to your uncle, directing his attention to a figure
hemmed in by a swarm of Sepoys.</p>

<p>"'Who is it?' he asked, as they stopped.</p>

<p>" The other glanced around. 'It must be Conway,' he said.</p>

<p>"Your uncle was off back, the officer who had spoken and two
or three others following.</p>

<p>"They would have all been sacrificed, but a lucky panic got
amongst the rebels, and they ran for their guns again. As it was,
the English got out sound, bringing my father with them. They
carried him back to the lines, but it was hopeless; he was
bleeding to death from a frightful tulwar wound, in addition to a
shot through the lungs. They laid him on the ground, and your
uncle knelt beside him. 'I saw you coming, old fellow,' he said,
as he gazed at your uncle, with the old look of friendship. Then
he motioned him to bend down a little. 'Take care of Annie and
little Fred,' he managed to say; and so, with his head resting on
your uncle's arm, and their hands clasped once more, he
died."</p>

<p><br>
I COULD not help being impressed by the story, told in the
still, calm night, with the silent river flowing past, and the
lights gleaming on its surface here and there; only the quiet
voice of my companion, telling of his father's death, breaking
the stillness. For a few moments I forgot my own troubles.</p>

<p>"How well he has carried out the trust reposed in him that day
I can testify," said Conway, after a pause. "And why were my
uncle and my father at variance always?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He will tell you himself; I prefer that he should," returned
Conway, and turned to walk back. The spell was broken, and I got
back to my own affairs again.</p>

<p>"But what is the best thing for me to do now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Hang yourself," I thought my companion muttered, but was not
sure.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "it's worse than ever. I am my uncle's
heir, I presume, so they'll never let me off."</p>

<p>"Your uncle has the disposal of his estate by will; so don't
reckon on that."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that; I mean this marriage with Miss Sphinx.
They'll reckon on it&mdash;the estate, I mean."</p>

<p>"Tell them it's not so."</p>

<p>"They won't believe me."</p>

<p>"Then marry somebody else."</p>

<p>"A glorious idea! Somebody my uncle approves of!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget that main chance."</p>

<p>"No; I'll ask Miss Vane."</p>

<p>"You'll do what!" said my companion, in a savage tone that
almost made me jump.</p>

<p>"Propose to Miss Vane," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose she'll accept you, then?"</p>

<p>"I presume I have a perfect right to ask the question?" I
said, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Of course you have," he said, sulkily. "And if she accepts
me," I went on working out the idea, "my uncle likes her very
much, so I am safe."</p>

<p>"If!&mdash;remember the if," said Conway.</p>

<p>"And if she refuses me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Vae victis</i>! or try somebody else," and Conway hurried
on and left me.</p>

<p>I knew he had a weakness for Miss Vane, so was not surprised
at the temper he had displayed. I had too good an opinion of
myself to fear his rivalry very much. I went over to North
Brisbane in search of my uncle, determined, now explanations were
the order of the day, to have full and clear ones. I found him
disengaged.</p>

<p>"Conway has told you of the deception practised on you," said
my uncle, in reply to my questions. "It was a poor joke, but
perhaps it has done you good; and if what I have got to tell you
now is hard on your pride, I am sorry, but you had better hear
it." He was silent for a few moments, and then resumed:</p>

<p>"My father wait a quiet country rector, thinking of little but
parish and his books; and my sister was a country girl, with as
much knowledge of the world as a baby. I was in India. Your
father was a man who, without the slightest claim to be
considered a gentleman&mdash;I can't help saying it&mdash;could,
when it suited him, assume a cloak of good manners that would
deceive unsuspicious people like my father and sister. He came
down to our neighborhood for the shooting season, and was staying
at the house of an eccentric kind of man who invited anybody who
amused him. He met your father at a racecourse, or some other
public place, I presume. Your father, as you pride yourself on
remembering, had good social talents, especially adapting him for
amusing for a time. How my father met him I never heard, but he
invited him to his house, and the result was that my sister
married him. To do your father justice, I believe he did love her
at first; no one could have helped it. I came home after the
mutiny, met your father, and saw the state of affairs at a
glance. If I loved anything on earth it was my sister, and when I
saw how she was neglected by her husband, I hated your father at
once. You see I am speaking quite plainly, as I would to a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Your father was anxious to cultivate my friendship, for I was
rich, and he had squandered everything he had. I offered him a
liberal income if he would leave the country, and consent to a
separation. He agreed at once; but your mother, with all a
woman's fidelity to one who ill-treated her, refused to comply. I
happened to go to see her once, after he had been urging her to
consent, and saw a mark on her face that made me think he had
struck her. She denied it, of course, and unfortunately he came
in just then. I am a passionate man by nature, and you can infer
what followed. I never saw either your father or mother again.
The income I regularly allowed her, your father, I presume, as
regularly spent, with the disgrace of the personal chastisement I
had inflicted on him not wiped out. Since his death I have made
you an annual allowance, for my sister's sake; but since I have
been here you have never given me reason to suppose that you
cared for her, or felt grateful to me for it."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence when he had finished. I felt that I
hated him for the way he had spoken to me; but he was my uncle,
and rich!</p>

<p>"Who was my father?" I asked at last, in as clear a voice as I
could command.</p>

<p>"The only son of a rich pawnbroker, who spent the fortune his
father left him in striving to gain an entrance into
society."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "I could not help it; am I not a Mervington
Smythers?"</p>

<p>My uncle laughed loudly; every serious wrinkle vanished from
his face. It was the happiest remark I could have made under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Mervington Smythers may be the name your godfathers and
godmothers gave you, but if there are ancestral honors bound up
in the name I am not acquainted with them. Your father's name by
rights was simply Smith&mdash;as good a one as Smythers, I should
have thought."</p>

<p>Then my vaunted arms and long pedigree were all a sham, and my
paternal grandfather advanced shillings and pence on articles of
dress, and made money by the sale of unredeemed pledges!</p>

<p>I felt very bitter against my uncle for acquainting me with
these facts, but deemed it prudent to hide the feeling.</p>

<p>"Now, having wounded your feelings enough, my boy, I must try
and heal them. What is this that your friend Mrs. Memphis tells
me about a tender feeling between you and her niece?"</p>

<p>It would never do to let him know how matters stood there. I
must conceal that business, and keep Mrs. Memphis and my uncle
apart, if possible.</p>

<p>"Mere absurdity, uncle," I said. "Mrs. Memphis, like a good
many more people, sees just what she would like to see. There is
no tender feeling between Miss Sphinx and me."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not sorry to hear it, for I must say neither aunt
nor niece are much to my liking. That Miss de Boys is a pretty,
good-natured little girl, and you seem rather devoted there."</p>

<p>"I like Miss de Boys very well, but to tell you the truth,
uncle, there is somebody I like better; and you like her
too."</p>

<p>"Who's the lady who is so highly favored by both of us?"</p>

<p>"Miss Vane."</p>

<p>"Miss Vane! Fred will have to look out with such a formidable
rival as you in the field."</p>

<p>"I know that Mr. Conway has hopes in that quarter; but I do
not see that I should therefore withdraw."</p>

<p>"Certainly not: a fair field and no favor."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear uncle, I have your consent to my soliciting the
hand of Miss Vane?"</p>

<p>"My consent is a trifle; it's Miss Vane's consent you
want."</p>

<p>"But it meets with your approbation&mdash;my choice?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you have some grounds to go upon; and there's no
accounting for a girl's fancy; but I think you will not steal a
march upon Conway."</p>

<p>"With your permission I will try," I said; and soon afterwards
said good night.</p>

<p>My feelings were very bitter that night. If Clara Vane would
accept me, it would solve all difficulties; save me from Miss
Sphinx and her aunt, for they would not say anything for their
own sakes; cut out Conway, whom I cordially disliked; mortify my
uncle, who evidently favored Conway; and show Mervington
Smythers, (whom they had made a butt of) to be the cleverest man
of the lot.</p>

<p>"<i>Vae victis</i>," Conway said; but it remained to see who
would be the vanquished. The odds were against me, truly, but I
did not despair.</p>

<p>The next day, thinking it best to lose no time I went to call
on Mrs. Vane, determined to propose then and there, should
opportunity offer. Everything seemed to favor me. Mrs. Vane left
the room, and I was alone with Clara. Now or never.</p>

<p>"Miss Vane," I said, "if you will pardon the apparently abrupt
manner in which I am forced to make my communication,
but&mdash;but I have something important to tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Smythers," she said, with a beaming smile that
encouraged me to proceed. "It is on a topic that has always a
charm for the young and fair," I said, rather poetically, as I
fancied.</p>

<p>"I think I can guess what's coming," she replied. Conway!
Conway! Where are you now! I mentally exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That assists me greatly, Miss Vane, for a man may be forgiven
for feeling nervous when his future fate hangs on a word from a
woman's lips."</p>

<p>"But your fate is fortunately settled, Mr. Smythers. You need
no longer be nervous."</p>

<p>Mervington Smythers! Mervington Smythers! You are a successful
and a clever dog, was my mental exclamation this time.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Vane," (I was nearly saying Clara, but thought it
premature), "thanks to your kind reception of what I was going to
tell you. I see no more cause for nervousness."</p>

<p>"But when is the marriage to take place, Mr. Smythers? Really
I am dying to know."</p>

<p>This was forcing the pace with a vengeance.</p>

<p>"As soon as possible. Do you think my anxiety is less than
yours, dear Clara?" Miss Vane laughed a clear, merry laugh. "I
always heard that lovers were the most absent-minded of people,
but never expected such an exemplification of it as that remark
shows."</p>

<p>"And when shall I have an opportunity of speaking to Mrs.
Vane?" I asked.</p>

<p>"O, mamma knows all about it."</p>

<p>"Does she? And she is favorably inclined, I trust."</p>

<p>"O yes&mdash;thinks it a capital match."</p>

<p>"And when did you first suspect the truth?" I asked
tenderly, for Clara looked most coquettishly pretty,
and I thought an accepted lover had a right to a sentimental
scene at least.</p>

<p>"I had an idea of it for some time, but was not sure of it
until she told us this afternoon."</p>

<p>"She told you?" I repeated in dumb horror.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Memphis; she was here about half-an-hour before you
came&mdash;"</p>

<p>I heard no more. Such a counter-check had never entered into
my calculations; henceforth I would be the willing slave of Mrs.
Memphis. I respected that woman&mdash;to rise from a bed of
sickness and call upon her friends in order to inform, them of
her niece's approaching marriage! Such energy was wonderful.</p>

<p>I have a dim notion of hearing Clara say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wasn't it fun, her taking Mr. Amberly for the maker of
Amberly's sauce? It was too bad of him;" and tottered out, after
shaking the servant girl's hand in mistake for Miss Vane's.</p>

<p><br>
"AND how did you prosper?" said my uncle when next I saw him.
I did what I ought to have done at first&mdash;told him
everything without reserve.</p>

<p>"I am to blame," he said; "but for that foolish job of mine
they would never have thought you such a catch; but I think I can
mend matters."</p>

<p>What he did I do not exactly know. I believe he told Mrs.
Memphis in confidence that I had mortally offended him; that not
only did he mean to cut me off with a shilling, but also to stop
my allowance. The result was enough for me.</p>

<p>Mrs. Memphis and Aurelia cut me dead, and Mrs. Memphis told
everybody that my conduct was just what she might have expected
from me.</p>

<p>My uncle did not go away as soon as he expected. When he did
leave he had acted the part of father twice, and given away two
very pretty brides. Need I say that one was Clara Vane, who
became Mrs. Conway; and the other was&mdash;well, I followed
Conway's advice, and asked somebody else; and somebody else said,
<i>"Oui, Monsieur,"</i> so you can guess who that was.</p>

<p>It wasn't a bad idea, for my uncle took a great fancy to
Bessie, and came down very handsomely, and she really is a
good-natured little girl.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. &mdash; A GREAT WAR NUMBER</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 9 Dec 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
'WE'LL have to make a flutter of some sort,' said Cootes, my
partner in the <i>Locustville Herald</i>, 'and I believe I've
struck a patch.'</p>

<p>Cootes was the business manager, etc., of the small country
paper, in which our modest capital was invested, and I was the
editor. Cootes saw that the travelling shows did not get tick for
their ads, and I abused the Government for not making the road
across Dongout Flat, and for not promoting the sergeant of
police, and not removing the postmaster, or sacking him.</p>

<p>'What's your notion?' I asked.</p>

<p>'A war number, sir; a war number teeming with maps and
illustrations; gore, and more gore; and when we are out of
breath, more gore.'</p>

<p>'Am I to write it up?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. You know nothing of the Cape; you don't properly
know the difference between a bombardier and a bullock driver;
and if you had to explain what single file meant, you'd say it
meant going like ducks. You're the very man.'</p>

<p>'Cootes, you've been drinking,' I said.</p>

<p>'I admit it; how can a man raise ideas without drink? Now, I
will see about the illustrations. Wexford and Stack, in Sydney,
have a lot of old blocks, which they have promised me, for a
song.'</p>

<p>'But a lot of old blocks will be no good.'</p>

<p>'Old blocks of the war, I mean. The inhabitants of Locustville
don't run much to illustrated papers, and a local production will
about stupefy them.'</p>

<p>'Well, go ahead; we can't be much worse off than we are, and I
suppose Wexford and Stack will give us credit?'</p>

<p>'They will. So I will now write out a flaming advertisement
that will set fire to Locustville, and then we win go over and
have a drink in honor of the war number of the <i>Locustville
Herald</i>.</p>

<p>Up to time came a weighty parcel of blocks from Wexford and
Stack, and a letter stating that they had been carefully selected
by an expert in South African warfare, and trusted they would
give us ample satisfaction. The blocks had a 'proof,' with the
names stuck on the back of them, so we sat down full of curiosity
and enthusiasm to plan out our great war number.</p>

<p>'We must have the generals first,' said Cootes, and he
selected a block which bore the appearance of somebody's
headpiece, and turned it over.</p>

<p>'Likeness of General Buller,' he read out. 'By George, we're
in luck the first go off.'</p>

<p>He gazed mournfully at the proof on the back of the block,
then passed it over to me.</p>

<p>'Doesn't look like General Buller,' he said; 'but I suppose
it's all serene.'</p>

<p>It did not look like General Buller; in fact, I unhesitatingly
pronounced it a portrait of the late Prince Bismarck, but Cootes
said emphatically, 'Wexford and Stack say it is General Buller,
and Buller it is. Pass it aside, old man,' and I passed it
aside.</p>

<p>'Charge of the 9th Lancers at the battle of Ladysmith,' read
out Cootes.</p>

<p>'Charge of the devil,' I said. 'Why, it's the charge of the
Light Brigade at Balaclava. "Half a league onward," you know, old
man!'</p>

<p>'Now, look here.' said Cootes, 'who knows most about this
South African war, you or the expert selected by Wexford and
Stack. Naturally the expert. That's the charge of the 9th
Lancers, or let us say, the New South Wales Lancers.'</p>

<p>'Go on,' I said. 'Don't let me interrupt you. They fought at
the battle of Dorking, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Suppose they did; they turned up trumps anyway. Now, we'll go
on. Bridge over Tugela River looks awfully like the bridge over
Mendoo Creek. Believe it's the same. What do you think?'</p>

<p>'Of course, it's the same; been over it scores of times. Look
here, old man, this sort of fake will never do. Everybody will
recognise Mendoo Creek.'</p>

<p>'All bridges are much alike,' mused Cootes. 'We might adopt
the dodge used by one of the Sydney dailies, and put it in upside
down, and call it the fortifications at Mafeking. There, now it's
upside down, it looks splendid. What do you think?'</p>

<p>'We'd better put it both ways while we are at it Lucky there
are no figures in it. How's this big one? Bird's eye view of the
battle of Glencoe, sketched from the military balloon?'</p>

<p>'Sounds well, and original. In reality it's a supposed bird's
eye view of the battle of Omdurman. I remember seeing it in a
London paper. What do you think, will the natives of this part
accept the Boers as wearing turbans and burnouses?'</p>

<p>'Well, if they accept our war number, they will accept
anything. What's next?'</p>

<p>'Farm near Pretoria, owned by a leading Boer.'</p>

<p>'It's an Australian homestead, anyhow. Looks like old
Blodger's farm. However, in it goes.'</p>

<p>'Portrait of President Kruger! No, by Jiminy, this will never
do; it's a likeness at the Prince of Wales. Even our subscribers
know old Kruger's phiz, by this time. What shall we call it?'</p>

<p>'The latest likeness of Colonel Baden Powell?'</p>

<p>'Right, that will do: you must explain in your article that
during the siege he has not had time to shave, that's why he has
grown a beard. But we must have Kruger. Let's see, there's a
patent medicine block just came up that we have never used
yet&mdash;portrait of a man with a baboon shave; suit Kruger all
to pieces. Entirely new one, you know.'</p>

<p>Cootes rummaged on a shelf, and produced a block purporting to
be the likeness of a man who had been saved by using Slammer's
crocodile powders. It was ugly enough for Kruger certainly, but
not in the least like him. However, Cootes decided on it,
although he acknowledged that it was an insult to poor old
Kruger.</p>

<p>'But he'll never hear of it, my dear boy,' he added. 'We're
safe.'</p>

<p>The rest of the blocks turned out much the same, and finally
the paper was brought out, a credit to Locustville, and a
journalistic example to Australia. Or the agonies I suffered
during the writing of the explanatory article, I will not dilate.
My only books of reference were Stanley's <i>Through the Dark
Continent</i>, and an old copy of Herodotus, neither of them of
much value, and only for getting hold of a Capetown railway
guide, with some unpronounceable names in it, I should have been
floored altogether. These, however, I used to the best advantage,
and the Boers fell back on many places where never a shot has
been fired during the present war. The sale was wonderful, and we
flattered ourselves that we had scored.</p>

<p>About a week afterwards, however, a rustic damsel rode up to
the office, dismounted easily and lightly, without waiting for
assistance, walked into the offices and laid a letter on the
counter.</p>

<p>'Want an answer,' she said, with a broad grin on her freckled
countenance. Cootes opened it, read it with come difficulty, and
passed it over to me. It ran as follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"> <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am
informed by a frend that yure illustrious (illustrated?) war
number contains a wicked lible on me. You haa my portrake in the
same as President Kruger, who, I am told, is a man of disreppable
karacter, so the same is an insult to me. Now I will let you orf,
on consideration that you gives me daughter fifty pounds,
otherwise I konsult my lawyer, and that will mean, thousands. A
prumpt reply will oblige. I am not to be held up to ridikule as
President Kruger for nothing.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours obediently,</p>

<p class="letter">John Barkus.</p>

<br>

<p>'By Jove!' said Cootes, 'I thought I knew the face. How could
I have forgotten old Barkus?'</p>

<p>'There's no answer,' I said to the waiting maiden.</p>

<p>'But I was told to bring one. Fifty pounds you was to give me,
dad says.'</p>

<p>'Very sorry,' said Cootes, 'but your dad's made a
mistake.'</p>

<p>The girl struck her habit smartly with a greenhide whip she
was carrying, and I moved back out of range. She looked spiteful.
Finally she departed peacefully, and we breathed again.</p>

<p>'Good fun,' said Cootes, nervously.</p>

<p>'Wait until the next. I know there's more in store; certain of
it.'</p>

<p>And there was. First Blodger came in with a bullock whip, and
said that he was not going to have his farm caricatured as
belonging to an adjective Boer. He'd let us know that there was
no Boer about him. It cost a small fortune in drinks to
conciliate him. But, unkindest cut of all, Wexford and Stack sent
up to say that they considered putting in the block upside flown
was a slur on their business, and they would be obliged for the
amount of their bill at once. They have not got it yet.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. &mdash; JOHNSON'S CHOW</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 31 March 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN Johnson first decided on getting up a Chinese cook, he
did it with great reluctance. There was an anti-Chinese feeling
in the district, and he suspected that his employment of Chinese
labor would render him unpopular, and he liked popularity. But,
to tell the truth, he had suffered so much at the hands of white
men cooks and married couples that his soul so hungered after
peace and the model Chinee that he finally made up his mind, and
sent down to an agent to send him up a Chinese cook.</p>

<p>Johnson had a nice little station in North Queensland, which
he looked after himself, and which paid fairly well. He liked
comfort and good cooking, but hitherto had failed to obtain
either. His experience of married couples had been unfortunate.
Raw immigrants fresh out by the B. and L. boats, had broken his
crockery&mdash;hard to replace&mdash;and ruined his digestion.
Once he got a treasure&mdash;the man seemed to understand station
work, and the wife seemed to have once occupied a superior
station, for she could cook divinely and was neat and tidy.
Unfortunately, the dream was rudely broken. A Jackeroo who was
shaping very well eloped with the woman, and the man came to him
in the morning and remarked in A familiar tone, 'I'm well out of
that.'</p>

<p>Johnson was a moral man in a quiet sort of way, and was
shocked at such heartlessness. But when the man explained to him
that he was of good family, and had run away with the girl for a
lark, and that just as they were getting tired of each other she
saved him all trouble by running away with the jackeroo, he was
even more shocked, and forswore married couples henceforth. The
men cooks led him a life. They were either dirty, or stupid, or
impudent, and, without exception, could not cook, hence the
evolution of the Chinese cook.</p>

<p>In due time the Oriental arrived&mdash;a tall and rather
dignified gentleman, who appeared rather to patronise his
employer than not. However, on experience, his cooking was a
dream. Johnson had taken some pains to furnish the store with
unwonted luxuries, and Ah Won turned out some very decent dishes,
the men complained that he kept them awake half the night
strumming on a Chinese guitar and singing a Chinese song to its
accompaniment, but, as he fed them well, the complaints were not
loud. Whenever any of his neighbors came over and chaffed Johnson
about employing Chinese labor, Johnson put one of Ah Won's
curries before them, and they departed converted men.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a brilliant moonlight night, some months after Ah Won's
arrival, when Johnson awoke with a feeling that there was
somebody moving about the house, somebody who had no business
there. He went out on to the verandah, and saw Ah Won there. Ah
Won evidently did not see him, and he had a sharp butcher's knife
in his hand, so Johnson slipped back and got his revolver. He
could not make it out Ah Won could not want to murder him. What
could he want? Robbery! Pooh! there was nothing on the station
worth anything.</p>

<p>He watched Ah Won, and saw him enter the sitting-room, then
immediately come out again. He next went to the open space in
front of the house, and before Johnson could conceive what he was
going to do, deliberately cut his throat with the butcher's
knife. Johnson gave a cry of horror, and dashed off the verandah;
but the deed was done effectually. Ah Won simply gasped a few
minutes with a nasty bubbling noise, and by the time the men,
aroused by Johnson's cry, had come on the scene, Ah Won was
dead.</p>

<p>It was a long way to send for the police, but Johnson did so,
and in the meanwhile, being a J.P., by the aid of one or two
neighbors, held a sort of informal inquest, and buried the body.
When the Chinaman went into the sitting room he left a note on
the table addressed to Johnson, in fair English, running as
follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Society want me. If not go, kill. If go, kill. What do? Kill
myself. <span class="smcap">Ah Won</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">
You let Mun Sing know&mdash;take body. If not, society kill
you.</p>

<p><br>
THIS was a nice ending to the quiet he had so long desired. He
did not show the letter to the police for various reasons, but
although he tried to make light of it, he could not help feeling
uncomfortable, for he had heard so much about Chinese societies
and their far-reaching power. Besides, who the devil was Mun
Sing?</p>

<p>Finally, he wrote to the agent who had forwarded Ah Won, eased
his temper by abusing him for sending a suicidal lunatic up to
him, and confided to him the task of finding Mun Sing.</p>

<p>A month afterwards a Chinaman rode up to the station, asked to
see Mr. Johnson, and stated that he was Mun Sing. Greatly
relieved, Johnson hastened to show Shim Ah Won's grave, and
offered him any help he wanted to dig him up and cart him
away.</p>

<p>Mun Sing listened gravely, and said,</p>

<p>'Where money?'</p>

<p>'There's no money. Ah Won drew his wages the day before he
committed suicide. Here's the grave, and you can do what you like
with the body, so long as you cart him off the station. I don't
want any of your confounded societies.'</p>

<p>'No money, no want body,' and the Chinaman mounted his horse
again, and rode off.</p>

<p><br>
FROM that date Johnson was bombarded with Mun Sings, who
turned up at uncertain intervals, and, all alike, demanded Ah
Won's money, and contemptuously refused his body. Johnson began
to grow thin under this infliction, and began to pray for the
society to turn up instead.</p>

<p>In this quandary a friend came to him, and said, 'Engage
another Chinese cook.'</p>

<p>'My colonial! no more,' returned Johnson.</p>

<p>'Take my advice,' said his friend, and Johnson took his
advice, and the agent sent him up another cook, name of Mun
Sing.</p>

<p>Johnson trembled. Mun Sing arrived, heard Johnson's story, and
laughed, then he proceeded to dig up Ah Won. Nobody assisted at
the operation&mdash;nobody wanted to.</p>

<p>Mun Sing took a small pouch from Ah Won's body, and
re-interred him; then he assured Johnson that it was
nothing&mdash;there was no society; Ah Won was mad.</p>

<p>The spurious Mun Sing did not stop long as cook, but when he
went away he had poor Ah Won's cheque, and other savings, which
he had found in the pouch on the dead body.</p>

<p>Johnson is still experimenting on cooks.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. &mdash; A MEAN PIECE OF WORK</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 10 Oct 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'WELL, Chinese is rum folk,' said Jim. 'Never had much to do
with them myself, but an old mate of mine told me a queer story
about one of them up north. You've been up that way, haven't
you&mdash;north of Queensland, I mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I've been there.'</p>

<p>'There's heaps of alligators there, so this man says?'</p>

<p>'Plenty in places.'</p>

<p>'His name was Denis Slatwell, not the Slatwell who was known
as Pig's Meat,' because a pig ate part of the calf of his leg
when he was asleep dead drunk, and he always walked with a kind
of a kick afterwards. I don't know if he was any relation; but it
don't matter. Denis said this yarn was as true as a speech in
Parliament, and, with the exception of selling a horse, I always
put him down as a truthful kind of man.</p>

<p>'It seems that you never can get to the bottom of a Chinaman,
even when he's drunk he's hiding something from you, and he's got
all manner of queer notions of his own about his body after he
dies. Always wants a fuss of some sort made about it. However, if
you've been knocking about those parts you might know if it's at
all likely to be true; for I don't believe in having any leg
pulled. This happened at a place called Burketown. Ever been
there?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'According to Denis, it's fairly alive with alligators. If
anyone gets up at daylight they think nothing of seeing two or
three scuttling off down to the river. Two Chinese gardeners had
a garden near the river, and one of them died of fever, and was
buried by the other Chinese. They didn't bury him deep, because
they meant to dig him up again afterwards, and cart his bones
back to China. One morning the live Chinaman got up, and going to
have a look at the grave, he found, to his astonishment that it
had been dug out, and the corpse was missing. Well, he searched
about everywhere, and at last, by the tracks, he came to the
conclusion that the blessed alligators had nosed him out and
taken him away.</p>

<p>'Some of the fellows from the township came down and examined
the tracks, and came to the conclusion that it was so. Denis
himself was one of them, and was quite convinced of it. Anyhow,
the Chinaman was terribly upset about it. It seemed the dead
partner was some sort of a relation of his, and he said he could
never dare to go back to China without the other man's bones. He
sold out the garden to a couple of his countrymen, and used to
pass all his time sitting on the bank of the river cursing at the
alligators. Denis said his curses were something awful. For all
they were in Chinese, and no one could understand them, they were
that blood-curdling that three of the hardest swearers and
drinkers in the town took the pledge, and his oaths killed all
the bees round where he used to sit. Of course, it wouldn't take
much of this before he went loony, and turned dangerous, so they
set out to quiet him. They got some blackfellows bones and put
'em to soak in the river. Then the first alligator that was shot
they produced these, and told him that they were those of his
lost countryman, and that everything was right now, and he could
give over cursing and take a rest. He was a simple-minded Chow,
and took it all in, or appeared to; and they had a fresh funeral,
and roasted another sucking pig, and gave the corpse a second
send-off.</p>

<p>'Everybody thought that things had been smoothed down nicely,
and the three men who had sworn off went on an entirely new
bender on the strength of it, when everything was capsized.</p>

<p>'Some Chinese fishermen at the mouth of the river caught an
alligator, and inside was the real and original Chinese gardener.
There were lots of things to identify him by, and the Chows
howled all night at what they had done. They dug up the bones
again, and hove them into the river, and buried the fresh find
there, and once more people thought there was peace on the
earth.</p>

<p>'But it wasn't to be. The new corpse couldn't rest in the
grave where the blackfellow had been, and took to haunting; his
old partner, which was a thundering mean thing to do. He insisted
that some of his bones were missing&mdash;not important bones,
but, still, their absence annoyed him, and his partner would have
to find them or he'd know what for.</p>

<p>'Now the Chow had done his level best all through, and this
trouble coming on top of the other made him a bit cranky. Up he
goes to the police magistrate, and states the case to him. The
P.M. tried to soothe him down, and explain to him that his
jurisdiction didn't extend to the next world, and the best thing
he could do was to pack up his duds and clear out somewhere else.
However, this didn't satisfy the Chinaman, and he went down to
the river and started cursing the alligators again, as the
original source of all the trouble; but the alligators took no
notice of him, so he up and hung himself on one of the trees he
had killed with his outrageous bad language. Then for the third
time the people thought that the matter was settled. But it
wasn't by a long chalk. It's a serious thing to have trouble with
a Chinese ghost, seemingly. The two ghosts got quarrelling, and
they used to play up old Harry with the garden, which didn't
belong to them at all. They had no sense of fairness and honesty,
for the men who had bought the garden&mdash;couldn't help
matters. But at it they'd go, and Bit there in the night and spit
Chinese at one another, and heave vegetables at each other, and
wreck the whole show. The other Chinese used to try and keep them
away by banging kerosene tins, cracking whips, and firing guns,
and this kind of jamboree went on every night until not a soul in
the town could get a wink of sleep.</p>

<p>'The P.M. told the Chinese to dig up the bones and bury them
somewhere else, and they did so, for they were pretty well full
of the racket. But it was not an atom of good. The two ghosts had
selected that garden for their fights to the finish, and meant to
have it out there, right or wrong.</p>

<p>'It was a low kind of act on the part of the first ghost, and
if I'd have been up there I'd have tried to reason with him; but,
perhaps, being a Chinese ghost, he wouldn't have been open to
argument. Still, I should like to have tried it on, for I never
did tackle a Chinese ghost.</p>

<p>'Now the Chinese had sent off to one of their countrymen, and
never said a word to anybody, which is their way. One day the man
they wanted came. A Chinese doctor, who could flatten any ghost
if he got a fair show. He made all inquiries, and shook his head
very gravely and, said that it was all the fault of the
alligators; and they wanted cursing properly. But the P.M.
objected. Said that they'd had enough of that game already, and
the only thing it had done was to bring in a drought. If anybody
tries it any more he should be run in straight.</p>

<p>'The Chinese doctor, a very polite man, said that it was a
pity, as he had a new patent curse, warranted to stand hot
weather, and he was anxious to try it. However, he would do his
best.</p>

<p>'It was a bright moonlight night when he went out to the field
of action, and all the township turned out to see the fun. Denis
says it was the best thing he ever saw. The ghosts were hard at
it, hauling each other about by their pigtails and using the most
iniquitous language. The doctor put on a pair of horn spectacles,
marched up to them and solemnly stared at them. They didn't pay
much heed to him at first, but gradually they began to get
uncomfortable and look uneasily at the doctor, until at last he
stared them into being quiet. Then he made them a speech;
everybody said it was a most beautiful speech, although no one
understood a single word of it but the ghosts. When he had
finished he made a step forward, and, lifting his hand, shooed at
them, and the ghosts retreated. On he went until he had shooed
them right out of the garden, down among the trees by the river
and clean out of sight. Presently he came back by himself.</p>

<p>'He explained that this was only the commencement, that it
would take some days to complete the work, and as he was talking
there arose the most horrible uproar from where the ghosts had
disappeared. It seems that, not knowing the country, he had
shooed them into the blacks' camp; and the niggers were bolting
in all directions. However, that didn't matter, for everyone got
a sleep that night, and next day the doctor was made an awful lot
of by all.'</p>

<p><br>
'NOW, there seems to be no besting a Chinese. Every night feat
doctor went out to take a full exit of the ghosts, but they
dodged him this way. They had to go, but he couldn't control the
direction, and one night he shooed them into a mob of travelling
cattle, and they rushed to glory. Another night he shooed them
through the back wall of the baker's house, and the baker's wife,
who was in an interesting condition, was frightened nearly to
death and there was trouble. So he had to hit upon something
else, and he did it&mdash;he just got there in the bull's
eye.</p>

<p>'He told the ghost that was making all the fuss that he was
going to examine his skeleton to find out which of his bones was
missing that he was making all this war about. This staggered the
ghost, and he seemed quite put out. At last he owned up that it
was one of the fingers of his right hand.</p>

<p>Now would you believe such low down, rascally conduct on the
part of even a Chinese ghost! That finger had been chopped off by
an accident years and years before he came to Burketown. It had
never been within hundreds of miles of the place, and the
alligators who had been so becursed were not guilty of keeping
the property, and as for his partner, whom he had driven to
suicide, he had never even seen the missing finger.</p>

<p>'It was all a bit of spite, because the bones of the
blackfellow had been put in his grave. Do you think it's a true
bill?'</p>

<p>'I should say that every word of it was a stubborn fact.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I'm glad you think that, knowing the place. I should not
like to suspect Denis of lying, unless it was about horses, which
of course is natural and allowable. Besides, I know that if a
ghost once makes up its mind to be a. nuisance it's bound to find
some excuse; but that was the mangiest dodge I ever knew.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. &mdash; THE DESERT QUEEN</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 2 Jan 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'A LONELY place to be buried in,' said one of the two men
gazing at the red loom of the sandhills to the westward,
quivering like the heat haze hovering over a glowing furnace.</p>

<p>'But not more so than the bottom of the sea, where many a good
fellow rests.'</p>

<p>'One sleeps just as well, whether on shore or in sea.'
answered his companion, looking at a quiet form, covered with a
blue blanket, lying under the scant shade of a neighboring
tree.</p>

<p>'Yes, poor Tom; he'll be quiet enough here. Where shall we
bury him?'</p>

<p>'Under that tree, I think. We'll cut his name pretty deep on
it. Not that it matters much, but It is the sort of thing his
wife will expect to hear about. Women are sentimental where their
dead are concerned.'</p>

<p>The flat on which they stood was desolate and almost barren
save for the little patch on which they where camped. There a
broken fragment of a creek had formed a short-lived channel. An
ancient gum tree that had looked on the unchanging solitude of
the surrounding desert for many long, long years of fiercest
drought until it was now a mere shell, stood on the bank bearing
some meagre-foliaged limbs on its shattered crown. At its foot
grew a clump of thin, wiry reeds, and a little spring of
half-brackish water soaked down from amongst them and formed a
pool in the bed of the creek. Around, for a little space, there
was dry grass mixed with the dull grey-green of the foliage of
the saltbush, and beyond the cruel, hard gleam of the spinifex,
dotted here and there by a stunted tree that fought for a barren
existence against the terrors of the climate; and beyond
again&mdash;rose up the desert wave of red sand.</p>

<p>It was in the heart of Australia, 150 miles west of the
furthest outside cattle station, where the tropic of Capricorn
intersects the longitudinal line that divides the province of
South Australia from the huge bulk of her sister colony. Drawn on
by the tales of the rich reefs of West Australia, then in the
glory of its rising boom, and believing, like many others, that
the gold-bearing country would in time be traced far into the
interior, the three men had started on a long prospecting trip,
hoping to strike the golden belt on its eastern boundary. Having
only horses with them and no camels, they found themselves
baffled by the arid and waterless sandhills, a tract of which
stretched across their route. Skirting this dreaded Sahara of
West Australia, they unfortunately came into collision with a
tribe of natives, and one of them&mdash;Tom
Deeling&mdash;received a fatal spear wound. With unwearying care
his comrades brought him away, and luckily came across the little
spring, which afforded them a brief halt; enough at any rate to
allow the sufferer to die in peace.</p>

<p>And he died, in such peace as the men of the advance guard of
civilisation can expect. With the hot and cloudless southern sun
o'erhead, the eternal stillness of the wild thirst land around,
and two trusty comrades by his side. The sky was a blaze of angry
glory by the time the men had finished their task. Prom the old
shell of a desert gum a shield of bark had been stripped, and the
dead man's name and the date of his death cut in the wood beneath
with a chisel, after the fashion of a survey mark:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
T.H. DEELING,<br>
DIED AUG. 9<br>
1892</p>

<br>

<p>His private belongings were being carefully looked over and
packed up. Landors, a tall, sinewy man, whose light blue eyes
contrasted strongly with his sun-blackened face, was looking at a
photograph amongst the letters and papers he was putting
together.</p>

<p>'Is this his wife, Joe?' he asked. Joe Monteith, a
middle-sized man with a full dark beard inspected it.</p>

<p>'I think so, he answered. 'I only saw her once, at the railway
station at Adelaide, and then she had a hat and veil on. It's
about her general look and figure, and her eyes look the same,
for they must have been very bright to have been noticeable
through her veil.'</p>

<p>'A good-looking woman,' returned Landors; 'but somehow she's
not one I should fancy.'</p>

<p>'Nor I. I shouldn't like the job of telling her about this
affair. Looks the sort who'd say it was all our fault.'</p>

<p>'How long had they been, married when we started?'</p>

<p>'Not long. Six months or so, Tom told me.'</p>

<p>'Had he any money? You knew more of him than I did.'</p>

<p>'Yes; he said to me that if anything happened to him his wife
would be all right.'</p>

<p>'What induced him, with money enough to live on, and only six
months married to a pretty, young wife, to come streeling out
here with us. It's the natural thing for you and me to do. The
outside country got hold of us "small and early," and when it
calls us we've got to go, and also we haven't any wives to
trouble about leaving behind; but it was different with Deeling.
He hadn't sucked the desert into his bones.'</p>

<p>'Poor old boy. He'll stay here now, and I bet he's not sorry,
for he let out some queer things when he was muttering just
before he died. And why did he make that strange will? He must
have had a special down on the fellow Blathkutt for such an
easy-going fellow as he was to make such a will.'</p>

<p>'Stick to that paper, Joe. If there's been a youngster since
we left it might mean something important.'</p>

<p>'I'll stick to it, safe enough, you bet,' said Joe.</p>

<p>Next morning they resumed their way, leaving only the red
mound of earth and the carved face of the ancient gum tree to
tell the tale of another white man gone to rest in the
wide-spreading arms of the desert.</p>

<p>Landors and his mate kept on, and by evening reached a belt of
good hard spinifex ridges trending westerly. The feed was scanty,
but some heavy thunderstorms had fallen of late, and they pushed
hopefully on into the unknown, as there would be a chance of some
of the broken little creeks holding water a short time.</p>

<p>Joe had ridden down one of these creeks, while Landors went
on. Seeing some damp-looking sand he got off, and commenced to
probe the sand with a stick. Unthinkingly he left his horse on
the bank, with the bridle trailing; when he looked up from his
search he saw it trotting up the ridge back towards their tracks.
With much blasphemy on himself and the horse, he mounted the
ridge, only to see the steed disappearing on the track they had
come.</p>

<p>Landors had gone on over the opposite ridge, and come to a
rocky gully with a fine supply of water. He halted and was
unpacking, when Monteith came up on foot. As darkness was closing
in and the horses had had a long day, it was useless going after
the fugitive that night. Moreover, it seemed certain that he
would make straight back to the last water at the grave.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't care a curse,' said Joe; 'I'd let him and the
saddle rip, as we've got Tom's, but that blessed will is in my
saddle pouch, where I put it for safety.'</p>

<p>Soon after the prospectors had left their camp In the morning
a wandering mob of blacks arrived, tired and hungry. They saw
that the whites had left, and therefore camped with confidence;
but that night one of them was awakened by the noise of some
animal drinking at the pool. For a wonder he looked first without
making a bad bolt. There-was a riderless horse there. He took
courage and softly roused some others. Very shortly Joe's horse
was being cut up into steaks and joints, the camp fires were made
up, ovens dug, and the saddle was soon hacked to pieces for the
sake of the ironwork.</p>

<p>When Joe arrived the next evening he found the bones of his
horse and the remains of the feast; also the remnants of a
saddle. The blacks' trail led over the sandhills, where there was
no following. Joe departed in hot wrath. If he had looked Inside
the shell of the old tree he would have found his saddle pouch
there, where it had been carelessly flung. As it was, he presumed
that it had gone on tour with the blacks.</p>

<p>In a week the spring dried up, and nothing, animal or human,
came near the wretched flat. Until rain fell the saddle pouch was
as secure there as in the Safe Deposit in Sydney, only nobody
knew of it...</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was somewhere about two year's before the letter containing
the news of Deeling's death and the accompanying parcel of his
private effects reached the widow. The delay had been
inconvenient, but by no means the fault, of the prospectors. They
had fought their way through and been to a certain extent
rewarded. Nothing gigantic had fallen in their way, but they had
secured a tidy show. They had left the things, with a letter, at
the first place they struck in touch with civilisation, and
various vicissitudes had been the lot of the packet since then.
It had been forgotten for months, resurrected, dropped aside
again, lost for some more months amongst Government stores,
imperilled by fire and water, narrowly escaped being shipped off
to England, and at last, with enough stamps on it to ensure its
delivery at the South Pole, had reached the hands it was destined
for in Sydney.</p>

<p>Its arrival was opportune. There was an insurance on Deeling's
life, but that was not of such vital importance as the fact that
Mrs. Deeling was particularly anxious to know if she was or was
not a widow. She had long looked upon herself as one, and would
have felt it as extremely bad manners on the part of poor Tom if
he had put in an appearance in the body. They had not lived very
happily for their brief term of wedded life, and as Deeling had
gone away in wrath, hoping that he never would come back again,
it would certainly have been bad taste on his part had he done
so.</p>

<p>Tom had left her a few thousands in his will, and the
insurance also was a couple more, when she got it. But the fact
was, although a hard, sharp woman enough, there was one man who
had found out the weak, spot in her nature, and he was not Tom
Deeling. Here again came in the peculiar warp of a woman's
nature.</p>

<p>Tom was an open, honest fellow, always more willing to give
than to take; a fool if you like, but a very lovable fool, liked
by all men, but not appreciated by his wife. The man who aspired
to his shoes, and who had led to the domestic infelicity, was
one of the secretive beings who go through life with an
atmosphere of selfish repulsiveness around them. No man wanted
his companionship, no man trusted him, no man cared whether he
lived or died, and no man but a blackfellow or a Chinaman would
have drunk a glass in friendship with him. This woman was simply
his willing slave.</p>

<p>But it is not a singular prank, and is well known as a
feminine peculiarity everywhere; even in the flying island of
Laputa, where the Court lady used to run away from her palace to
live in rags with the deformed, drunken footman who beat her.</p>

<p>Tom was dead, she was a free woman to marry again, and she had
no child to remind her of the dear departed. The first thing was
to find out the two prospectors; the insurance people required
their sworn declaration. That ought not to be very hard. The reef
they had found on the termination of their weary journey was now
a busy centre, and if they were still there the 'wire would soon
find them.</p>

<p>When Blathkutt, Tom's supplanter, came on his diurnal visit
she told him the gleeful news. He went into the raptures suitable
to the situation, did and said all he was expected to do, and
then turned to review the main chance.</p>

<p>'The insurance money will be paid, I believe, as soon as the
sworn declaration is produced; but there's another question. If I
were you I should advance a claim for a third share of whatever
may have been found on that trip. They don't mention anything of
what they have done; but if they have got a good reef, and there
have been some rich finds lately, it means a large sum of
money.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Deeling looked at him with admiration. What a clever man
he was; if anyone had mentioned sharp practice she would have
withered them with scorn.</p>

<p>'Is it ours by law?' she asked; and he noted the word
'ours.'</p>

<p>'Well, I am afraid not; but we can make things so
disagreeable, get an injunction, threaten a long lawsuit, and
play the bereaved widow business so as to make them glad to
compromise.'</p>

<p>Her admiration of his business smartness was doubled. Landors
had written the letter. He was a mere cautious man than Monteith,
not that he suspected any underhand work, but being naturally
reticent, he said nothing about their subsequent adventures after
Deeling's death; and nothing about the will, merely informing the
widow of the circumstances of his death, and a list of the
effects, and saying that he and his partner would pay for
Deeling's horses and outfit at the cost price.</p>

<p>Blathkutt soon found out that two of the principal
shareholders in and the original prospectors of the celebrated
Desert Queen were Landors and Monteith. The partners received two
letters&mdash;one from the insurance office requesting their
sworn declarations as to the death of Deeling, and one from the
widow, very gushing, very grateful, and very much interested in
the reef, with a delicate hint as to what share she, as the
widow, could claim in it.</p>

<p>Landors and his partner felt rather puzzled. Actually
speaking, neither in justice or sentiment had the widow of their
dead comrade any share in the Desert Queen. They had noticed some
likely-looking country on their way over not many days before
they struck an outside camp, but had not stopped to prospect.
Afterwards they had returned, and finally found the Desert Queen
on a separate expedition altogether.</p>

<p>A guarded answer was sent back enclosing the desired
declarations and the price of the horses, but evading the subject
of the Desert Queen. The next thing was a legal letter from the
widow's solicitors putting forward a claim for her husband's
share. This roused every fighting instinct in both of them, as
they knew the widow was not in want, and this claim was a piece
of barefaced attempt at grabbing.</p>

<p>'What did I tell you when I saw her face?' said Landors.
'You've told her about the will?'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't, as I reckon that will might as well be at the
bottom of the sea as traipsing about the sandhills with a mob of
myalls.'</p>

<p>'There's a man behind this,' said Monteith.</p>

<p>'Bet you what you like it's the Blathkutt fellow that Deeling
had the down on.'</p>

<p>'Looks like it. Well, he won't get any good out of the
badgering game, and all they'll do is to spend the insurance
money.'</p>

<p>'There's Marpells starting out in a day or two, talks of going
right across to the overland line. Blessed if I don't feel
inclined to go with him, and overhaul every gin's dilly bag we
come across.'</p>

<p>'Not much good that; but I've known them to carry things about
for years, for no earthly reason.'</p>

<p>'Hanged if I don't go,' said Joe, and he went.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE lawyers saw something in the case seemingly&mdash;not a
claim, but the chance of a stiff compensation to avoid expensive
litigation, and the bereaved widow dodge could be worked for all
it was worth. There was the making of a most effective and
affecting case. The young husband dying in the lonely desert, his
last breath spent on a blessing on his widow. She, poor,
sorrowing woman, forced to enter in another loveless marriage to
keep her from starving, and the wicked companions gloating in the
wealth wrung from, the rightful owner.</p>

<p>So certain did Blathkutt feel of the case turning in something
that, after a few months had passed, he urged their speedy
marriage, so that he could the better look after her interests.
She agreed willingly, and the marriage was solemnised on the very
day that Monteith, in company with Marpells's party, rode down
the flat to the grave at the spring.</p>

<p>The spring was running once more; a whirlwind in passing had
snapped the ancient tree off short, and hurled the trunk across
the grave. It was twisted off above the inscription, and the stem
stood up like a jagged tombstone.</p>

<p>Joe had been the curiosity of the trip. Every packet of skin,
every dilly bag, etc., had been overhauled in each camp they had
come across. But without avail. The bones of piccaninnies, the
shrivelled bodies of frogs, and various other relics rewarded
him, but no saddle pouch, no papers. No wonder, for Joe was at
that instant leaning on the edge of the stump that concealed the
very thing that he was in search of...</p>

<p>The others were grouped around reading the inscription, and
listening to the story of the death that Joe was telling. A wet
season had replenished the little spring, and it was gushing
forth once more. Marpells was leaning against the side of the
stump near Joe. He looked inside, and whistled.</p>

<p>'Joe, your blessed pouch is here waiting for you. Look inside
the stump for it.'</p>

<p>Joe looked. The pouch had been partly covered by the white
ants with an incrustation of clay, but it was there right enough.
He fished it out, and gasped.</p>

<p>'Open it, Marpells.'</p>

<p>Marpells did so. There was Joe's own private papers of one
sort or another, and the precious will.</p>

<p>'By Jove, you ought to go to every niggers' camp between here
and Coolgardie and make a public apology,' said Marpells.</p>

<p><br>
LANDORS came over to Adelaide to meet Monteith, in response to
a wire from the overland line.</p>

<p>'It was the greediness of the fellow did it all,' said Joe.
'If he'd been contented with what he had, and not grabbed for a
share in the Desert Queen, I'd never have gone looking for that
will just to spite him.'</p>

<p>The will was plain enough. Deeling left all to his wife on
condition that she did not marry Blathkutt; if she married
Blathkutt everything went in trust to his child if there was one;
if not, to a brother and sister. The insurance money, which did
not belong to them, was already half gone in law expenses, and
things generally looked bad for the Blathkutts. But the late Mrs.
Deeling did not lose faith in her husband, and whenever a word
was mentioned concerning the matter was voluble in her abuse of
her first husband and his two companions.</p>

<p>'People when they're dying see clearly, and I expect Deeling
knew what he was doing,' said Joe; 'but it was deuced lucky that
Marpells and the others saw it found, or we should have been
accused of forgery.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>19. &mdash; WAIFS OF THE STRAITS</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 17 Dec
1898</h3>

<p class="first">
THE sea casts up some strange waifs. One day into the group of
islands on the northern-most point of Australia, of which
Thursday Island, though least, is most important, it cast a
storm-beaten proa, having on board three Malays, two alive, or
between life and death. Hunger and thirst, but especially thirst,
had reduced that gaunt crew to skeletons. The proa was rudderless
and dismasted, and they sat with hollow eyes awaiting death; when
one of the schooners belonging to the shelling fleet espied the
waif, and went to examine her.</p>

<p>The two Malays were taken off, the third received a sailor's
grave, and the proa became derelict.</p>

<p>The men were revived with rough kindness, and taken to the
township, where, the police magistrate took charge of them. In
time they gained strength enough to speak, and tell their story;
such of it as they chose to tell, for the Malay is ever a
secretive animal. They had been fishing for trepang and getting a
little pearl-shell also, off the Company's Islands, when they
were blown away to sea, dismasted and left helpless.</p>

<p>How long they had been drifting about they knew not, but fate
at last led some wandering current to bring them down to within
sight of Friday Island, where the schooner picked them up. One
was a tall, old man, who gave the name of Ras-All; the other, a
much younger man, called himself Abdrahim. They asked after the
proa, and were told it had been left adrift. They listlessly cast
down their eyes indifferently at the news.</p>

<p>All this information was obtained from them by means of one of
the Malay divers.</p>

<p>When they had recovered sufficiently, they were informed that
the Queensland Government would give them passage to somewhere
near their native place, whence it would be easy for them to
return home. They asked if work could be obtained there for men
of their occupation; and when they were told it could, they said
they would stay.</p>

<p>So they stayed on, and in a few months learnt a little
English, and began to earn good wages on a station on Prince of
Wales Island, for they both could work well when their strength
returned.</p>

<p>One day a wandering aboriginal or Binghi brought in word that
there was an old proa lying on the far beach of Prince of Wales
Island, where whites seldom went in those days. He described it,
and the man whom he told happened to be the employer of the two
castaways, who were then scraping and cleaning shell in the
shed.</p>

<p>White called them over.</p>

<p>"Ras All," he said, "this Binghi has found your old craft, I
think." And he described what the nigger had told him.</p>

<p>The Malays listened in silence, and then one said, "We would
like to see if it is ours. Ask the Binghi, sir, if it is
far."</p>

<p>White, who knew the island thoroughly, soon located the place,
and informed them that it was not more than three miles across
the ridges, but very rough travelling.</p>

<p>They thanked him, and went back to their work. That evening,
after knock-off time, they came and asked for two days' leave, to
go and see if it was the remains of their old proa. They were
steady workmen, and White readily consented.</p>

<p>Mohamed, the diver, who had acted as interpreter, was standing
by when they made the request.</p>

<p>"Those strange men Malay," he said to White.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Where do they come from?"</p>

<p>"A small island" (he could talk good English) "off Celebes. No
one lands there, no stranger. Strange men, but good sailor man.
What they want old proa for?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said White, "but they're welcome to
her. The fellows on the schooner should have sunk her, and not
let her go drifting about."</p>

<p>Mohamed said no more, but next morning, when the two sea waifs
started, Mohamed was away too.</p>

<p>They came back at the appointed time, and Mohamed also. The
latter went to White, and told him a strange and wonderful story.
Put into plain English, it ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
I TOLD you these were sea-devils from the island off Celebes;
and I followed them to see what they wanted with the old proa.
They went by the paper chart you had given them, and came almost
direct to the proa. It was theirs. They examined it all over, and
at last seemed satisfied, but, as I had to remain hidden some
distance off, I could not see exactly what they did, but I feel
sure they took something from it.</p>

<p class="quote">
Then commenced their devil's tricks. They lit a fire, and sat
by it singing one of their songs. Presently the old man, Ras All,
went to the edge of the sea, and stretching out his hands gave a
great and terrible cry.</p>

<p class="quote">
A cry! I have heard once before off Flores, and that night we
were wrecked. Seven times this awful cry went afar over the sea,
and then strange things began to crawl on to the beach, and sit
around waiting.</p>

<p class="quote">
At last the thing that they waited for came. A man, a strange
man, Malay, who had been dead for months, came out of the sea,
and approached Ras All. His eyes were gone, and his wet hair was
entwined with seaweeds, but it was the third man on the proa.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Have I kept my trust?" the thing said to Ras All. And I could
hear every word.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Well have you kept it."</p>

<p class="quote">
"Then can I sleep so that I shall not hear the great cry?"</p>

<p class="quote">
"Sleep well, O friend."</p>

<p class="quote">
The dead man turned to go, but stopped. "Keep thou the trust,
too; and woe to those who would interfere."</p>

<p class="quote">
"Woe to those who would interfere. Let those who listen
beware."</p>

<p class="quote">
At this the dead man entered the sea again, and all the
strange and horrible creatures did the same. And just then the
sun went down.</p>

<p class="quote">
I was frightened, but I could not come back through those
gullies and ravines in the dark; so I waited until the morning,
and as soon as it was daylight I started.</p>

<p class="quote">"Now, sir, what did those strange-men Malays
take from the wreck of the old proa?</p>

<p class="quote">
"I cannot guess; nothing to interest me. Whatever it was it
belonged to them; so that it is no business of ours."</p>

<p class="quote">
But Mohamed thought that it was his business. Besides, he knew
more than Mr. White did in the matter; and more about the strange
Malays of the island off Celebes. He knew too much of the various
ramifications of his countrymen to suppose that he could ever win
their confidence, so he watched, and his watching was rewarded.
He argued astutely, a Malay does not wear sufficient clothing
when working amongst shell to afford a handy place of
concealment; thus, whatever the "trust" was, that had been taken
from the wreck of the proa, it was concealed somewhere, probably
in tho bush.</p>

<p class="quote">
After many days and nights he was rewarded. It was midnight
one night when the sleepless spy saw the two Malays move like
shadows out of the sleeping shed, and like a shadow ne followed
them round the beach for nearly half-a-mile, and then they came
to where a spring oozed from the bank, and trickled shiningly
over some rocks. Part of the overflow diverged into a hole in the
rock, and Mohamed saw, under the light of a half-moon, Ras All
plunge his hand and arm into this hole, and draw something forth.
The two heads bent together, then the object was replaced, and
the two returned on their tracks, passing the concealed Mohamed
too close to be pleasant.</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, however, was his chance, and he went to the trickling
spring, and, putting his hand and arm into the small hole, found
a box of some sort. It was small and heavy; but he dared not stop
to examine it then. He concealed it in another place, and afraid
to go back to the sleeping shed stole to the back of the house,
and threw himself down there till daylight.</p>

<p class="quote">
Next morning, when all were at work, Mohamed asked for the
boat to go across to Thursday Island. Then only, with the
rippling strait between them, did he feel safe to examine his
find. Landing at the boat jetty, he quickly found a place to see
what he had stolen.</p>

<p class="quote">
It was a small strong case, made of some aromatic wood, on
which the water seemingly had made no impression. It was fastened
by several springs, which his Malay intelligence quickly detected
and understood, and the contents soon lay before him.</p>

<p class="quote">
He had hoped for jewels, a hoard of pearls found amongst the
Company's Islands, but never did he expect to find anything like
this. Diamonds and rubies constituted the chief part, the rest
were pearls, such as he, in all his diver's experience, had never
seen. Who were these mysterious waifs of the ocean to have such
treasure with them in a leaky old proa? And then his blood rah
cold at the thought of what he had done, for did not the very
dead guard this trust? How could he hope to escape?</p>

<p class="quote">
The storm could not destroy it, the sea could not swallow it;
the winds brought it to the shore of the island, where the
guardians were. Mohamed grew chilly with fright, though the
tropical sun was blazing.</p>

<p class="quote">
At last his fears and his greed came to a compromise. He would
take but one or two of the jewels, enough to make him fairly well
off, the rest and the casket he would put back, thus would he
deceive the guardians and save himself. A steamer would be in
port the next day, by her he would go north.</p>

<p class="quote">
Satisfied by this reasoning, Mohamed selected three jewels
that he thought would answer his hopes, then reclosed the box,
and rose to return; he felt that he could not rest until he had
restored the casket to its hiding place. He determined to sail
straight across to the point where the spring was; it was
concealed from the station by a bend, and seldom visited.</p>

<p class="quote">
He very soon reached the spot, lowered the sail, and stepped
out into the shallow water, with the painter in his hand to make
the boat fast. He had almost reached the shore when he felt
himself clutched by the ankle. With a scream of horror he dragged
his foot up high enough to see that he was held by a human hand,
the hand of the dead guardian.</p>

<p class="quote">
Then the head belonging to the hand appeared above the
surface, and that awful cry went forth, the summoning cry that he
had heard before. Then Mohamed knew, that he was doomed.</p>

<p class="quote">
He fought and tugged and slashed with his knife, but the dead
hand held firm, until he saw the forms of the two Malays
approaching, in their hands the knives used for cleaning
shell.</p>

<p class="quote">
"Woe to those who would interfere!" sounded in his ears.</p>

<p><br>
THE two Malays, Ras Dal and Abdrahim, went north in the
steamer, but Mohamed's body was not found for some time after she
had left. He was missed, and supposed to be drunk in the
township; so, in looking for the boat they found him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. &mdash; MY FRIEND CALIBAN</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 22, 29 Oct 1898</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE wind had dropped considerably, but it was still blowing
half a gale of wind, and the sea was, I think, worse than ever.
To stand was impossible, for it was not ordinary rolling and
pitching, but the unmanageable hulk was tossed wildly about all
directions&mdash;the most accomplished acrobat could not have
kept his feet for half a minute. There was a glimmering of light
coming, and I knew that the tardy day must be breaking at last.
How we had kept afloat during the night was a miracle. Certainly,
we had everything well battened down and we had lost both masts
when the hurricane first struck us, so perhaps that had saved
us.</p>

<p>But how many had been left on board? All night we had been at
the mercy of the sea, and the decks had been swept clear of
everything movable. I was cut by the ropes I had tied myself up
with, but being under the break of the little forecastle had
escaped some of the worst of it, but whether anyone else was
alive on board I had no idea. I scarcely thought it possible.</p>

<p>A grey sullen, morning broke at last and showed me a
clean-swept deck and a tossing sea of green and white. The
rolling of the vessel was something tremendous and sickening, and
it was only by an accident that I had fastened myself in the
centre of the deck, else the seas that broke over the sides when
she lay gunwale under would have soon drowned me. I saw that to
stand or crawl was alike impossible, and perforce I must lie
there helpless until the gale had blown itself out and the sea
went down somewhat. It was anything but a nice lookout. I was
sore, numbed, and chafed, and thirsty, and I knew my thirst would
rapidly increase, augmented by the salt spray that continually
whipped my face.</p>

<p>All the morning I lay there, and by noon the wind lulled, the
sun was out, and the sea somewhat gone down. The rolling was
still pretty bad, but I thought if I could get on my legs again I
could manage to reach the little after cabin, and find something
to relieve my thirst. Cautiously I undid my fastenings, and,
after stretching and working my cramped legs and arms I essayed
the task of traversing the heaving slippery deck. We had ragged
gaps in the low bulwarks, and both our boats and all deck lumber
had disappeared. Once I had a nasty capsize, and shot down the
deck, and only by a fluke landed against a piece of the bulwark
that was still standing, but finally I reached the little covered
hatch leading to cabin, and after some trouble got the doors open
and was pitched headlong down the two or three steps by the hull
getting tossed up on an extra big wave.</p>

<p>Half stunned, I got on my legs and scrambled up and fastened
the doors, for If she shipped a bigger sea than usual I stood a
good chance of getting drowned. The little cabin was then as dark
as pitch, but I groped about until by great good luck I came
across a canvas bag that I had accidentally brought on board
among my traps and that Ned and I had used for cooling water. It
was a large one, originally intended for slinging round the neck
of a packhorse, and being hung up and well corked had survived
all the knocking about, and I got the most delicious drink from
it that I ever had in my life, or ever hope to have.</p>

<p>Refreshed by it, and feeling that it had put new life into me,
I stood thinking and listening to the groaning and wallowing of
our poor dismasted schooner, and the swish of the water that had
found its way into the cabin, and now washed over my feet at
every roll of the vessel. I groped all over the cabin, in the
hope that I might find someone there who had taken refuge, but
no; no man likes to be below, any moment expecting to go to the
bottom, and all hands must have stayed on deck, and one by one
been washed overboard to drown.</p>

<p>I found my way to the little pantry, and, thanks to the way
the shelves had been rigged, I get some biscuit, half a bottle of
rum, and a pannikin. Bracing myself up, I managed to make a
dismal sort of meal in the dark. Not that I particularly enjoyed
it, but because I felt it necessary to keep my strength up if I
was to make any sort of fight for my life. I finished my meal to
the accompaniment of the gurgling water outside that at times
seemed right overhead, as though the ill-used little craft was
sinking at last, having given up the battle in despair. I managed
to get on deck again, and found that the weather had now
seemingly set in fair, and that by the next morning I should be
able to go about without much danger or difficulty.</p>

<p>My temporary safety being now assured, I had time to think
with regret of the fate of the others. Poor Ned Rowlands, my
friend and partner; Alick, the old man-of-war's man; and the
three kanakas. What would I have given to have seen one of them.
It was scarcely likely that any of them could be still hidden in
the forecastle, for if alive they would have crawled on deck
before now.</p>

<p>As I thought of this and gazed forward, I saw the sliding door
move back and a head peer out. A hail was on my lips, but
surprise stopped me, for the head was the head of a stranger. It
was a hideous head, grizzled and stubbly-bearded, lank, with a
slinking villainous look about it, and evidently the head of a
big-framed man. How did this creature come to be on board of our
little schooner? He was not on board, to my knowledge, when we
left Thursday Island five days before.</p>

<p>Slowly the man came cautiously out, and at length caught sight
of me where I stood, and latter regarding me curiously for some
time started to come aft. I stood watching him with a strange
feeling of dread and disgust.</p>

<p>One would have thought that at that time I should have been
glad to see any human being, no matter how mysterious his
presence might have seemed, but I was not, and as the stranger
came carefully along the deck I should not have cared much if one
of the lurches had tilted him overboard through one of the gaps
in the bulwarks. He was a great big-boned man, thin and
emaciated, but still a strong man; but his face was most
repulsive, and from his appearance he evidently had colored blood
in him.</p>

<p>'Ullo!' he said when he had got near enough to make
conversation possible.</p>

<p>'Who the devil are you?' I asked, 'and where did you come
from?'</p>

<p>'Been down below,' he said in a harsh, rasping kind of voice.
'I'm pretty well broke up; can you get at any water or grub for a
fellow?'</p>

<p>He spoke in a way that had a kind of foreign twang about it,
but yet was quite plain English, like that of a man who had
picked up the language in Ratcliffe Highway or Tiger Bay. It went
to my heart to waste that cool, sweet water on such a brute, but
yet I had to do it.</p>

<p>'Do you mean you were stowed away?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. Got on board at Thursday Island&mdash;one of your
kanakas helped me. Wanted to get to West Australia. Heard you
were going round to Cossack.'</p>

<p>A thought flashed through my mind.</p>

<p>'Did you come off that French man-of-war?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I did, and perhaps I didn't. Anyhow, don't keep a man
perishing here while you ask questions.'</p>

<p>There was some sense in this, I had to admit and reluctantly I
turned to the cabin door to open it. He came close beside me as I
did so, and put a huge hand on it to assist me. What a huge hand
it was, and what a length of arm he had. Like a baboon's.</p>

<p>I stumbled down the stairs; the seas were not so bad now, and
we could afford to leave the door open without much risk of being
swamped. I found the pannikin, and gave it to him to hold while I
lifted the waterbag down. He was smelling it when I turned
round.</p>

<p>'Been rum in this,' he said. 'Where is it?' His eyes gleamed
in the semi-darkness, and I went to the pantry and got the
biscuit and the rum bottle, but I took the precaution to pour
most of it that was left on the wash of the floor; then I brought
it out to him. He drank the rum and water and munched the
biscuit. Then he picked up the empty bottle and eyed it
suspiciously.</p>

<p>'There's more where that came from,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't think there is; we didn't take many stores on board,'
I returned. 'Whether or no, go on deck again and keep a lookout
while I rummage round.'</p>

<p>He looked at me, and for some reason or another I slipped my
hand in the pocket of my sodden white coat, whether to put on an
affectation of ease of not I cannot remember, but he mistook the
movement, and I went on deck without a word. He thought I had a
revolver in my pocket. This gave me an idea, and I went to poor
Ned's bunk and got, his revolver and my own too. As far as I knew
these were the only firearms on board, barring a Winchester, for
which we had no cartridges.</p>

<p>Then I went on deck to learn more of my unwelcome guest. I
pretty well guessed who he was&mdash;an escaped French convict,
captured at Singapore, who had been put in the man-of-war there,
and was being taken back to New Caledonia. We had been lying
pretty close to the Frenchman, and it would have been easy enough
for him, with assistance, to reach our schooner and get
aboard.</p>

<p>'Well,' I said when I had reached the deck, you had a rough
time of it during the hurricane.'</p>

<p>'I did indeed. Now on my head, and now on my heels. Things
rolling about. I am bruised all over.' His face bore witness of
it.</p>

<p>'When the sea settles, I get back to Thursday Island.'</p>

<p>'To Thursday Island?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The wind has set in nor'west, and we must run before it. It
won't change for three or four months now.'</p>

<p>He mused for a bit.</p>

<p>'Ah, well; we can do nothing until this sea goes down, but
perhaps you can find something more to eat, and some tobacco. It
would make the time pass more quickly.'</p>

<p>I agreed to this, for I wanted some more to eat myself; so I
went below and got at the few stores we laid in, and found some
tins of preserved meat, and milk, which with biscuits and the
waterbag would make a decent feed. These I took on deck, and my
new acquaintance and myself made a hearty meal, at the end of
which he quietly pocketed the sheath knife I had brought rip to
open the tins with.</p>

<p>'It is necessary to have a knife about one when one is going
to work,' he said, in answer to my inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>I had not forgotten the pipes and tobacco, and under their
influence I began to look on things from a little more cheerful
light. Leaving out the death of my companions, a short run under
any sort of rig would bring us back to Thursday Island, running
before the north-west monsoon that had now set in.</p>

<p>Then my guest's remark flashed across me. Naturally, very
naturally, he did not want to go back to Thursday Island!</p>

<p>We passed a quiet night; I did not sleep much, but my visitor,
whom I had mentally called Caliban, slept soundly; no doubt he
was pretty well tired out Before daylight I fell asleep, as one
has a habit of doing after a sleepless night, and the sun was up
when I awoke.</p>

<p>The sea was calm, our unfortunate craft was as steady as a
ship motionless, and not under control, could well be, end
Caliban was walking up and down the deck smoking.</p>

<p>'Oh!' he said, when he saw me get up. 'This is good, my
friend, after being down there,' and he pointed to the
hatchway.</p>

<p>'Let's get some breakfast, and start to work,' I said. 'The
sooner we get back the better. A storm may spring up any moment
while the northwest is on.'</p>

<p>At this moment I suddenly became conscious of the lightness of
my pockets, and hastily thrust any hands in them. The revolvers
were gone. Caliban looked at one with, a horrible grin.</p>

<p>'You miss something, my friend. I have them here. You sleep on
your back, and I am afraid they will roll overboard, so I take
care.'</p>

<p>He took one out as he spoke. In an instant I turned and darted
down the cabin.</p>

<p>'It is useless!' he cried after me.</p>

<p>'I have been, there already.' I had put Ned's Winchester under
his mattress, and it was there still. I must bluff. I ran out
again, and he started when I covered him.</p>

<p>'Give up those revolvers!' I said.</p>

<p>'I give you one,' he cried, 'that is but fair, one and
one.'</p>

<p>His hand was fumbling in his pocket, and I guessed that he was
trying to extract the cartridges.</p>

<p>'Put it down on the hatchway,' I said fiercely,
'or&mdash;'</p>

<p>My finger was on the trigger of an empty rifle, but he did not
know that, and put the revolver on the hatch and retreated
forward. I picked the revolver up, and looked down the chambers;
there were four cartridges in it; one chamber was empty. So he
had managed to slip one out. This gave him six shots to my four,
for the two revolvers were mates. Never mind, Caliban was
vulnerable; his heart was not so big as his body.</p>

<p>'Now we will have breakfast,' I said.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' he replied; 'I am quite ready for it.'</p>

<p>He treated the little difference of opinion as something not
to be regarded seriously, but I did not feel the same. The man
was determined not to go back to Thursday Island, where he would
be recognised and recaptured, and would stick at no means to
hinder it. I must act with diplomacy, or I would be taken at some
unguarded moment, and follow my poor friends. We sat down to our
meal.</p>

<p>'What will they do with you if they get you back to New
Caledonia?' I asked, as though it was a matter of course that he
hailed from there.</p>

<p>'I am afraid they will be rather severe. I had an unfortunate
difference with two guards when I escaped.'</p>

<p>'You killed them, in fact?'</p>

<p>'I am afraid so. Not on their account, for they were bad men.
But, then, it will go against me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I understand. That is why you do not wish to return to
Thursday Island?'</p>

<p>'Exactly. I would go to Western Australia.'</p>

<p>'But we cannot get there now. We cannot, beat back against a
head wind without masts.'</p>

<p>'We can try.'</p>

<p>'We wont try. I can beat up north, and put you on board a
steamer, China or British India?'</p>

<p>'That would not suit me. I am what you call a marked man.' At
this moment I heard something like a human voice in agony crying
out below, and Caliban heard it too, and we both started up. The
sound was unmistakable; the hull was not groaning now.</p>

<p>'There is somebody below,' I cried.</p>

<p>'Sit down, my dear friend, and finish your breakfast; there
cannot be anybody below. Have I not been down there myself?'</p>

<p>In an instant I knew the man was lying. Right behind him was a
rent and ragged gap in the bulwarks. If those long, ape-like arms
and huge hands got hold of me I was lost. I sprang at him, and
hit him straight out from the shoulder, right between the eyes.
He had not expected it.</p>

<p>A slight roll assisted me, and over he went, and with a loud
curse went splash into the sea, and I sprung forward to the
forecastle, for I guessed that under the little hatch there,
where Caliban had come from, I should find the man who had made
that moan.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
I WAS not mistaken. When I had pulled up the little hatch, and
called down, I received an answer, and to my joy it was in Ned's
voice.</p>

<p>Hastily letting myself down I groped my way towards him.</p>

<p>'Are you hurt; how did you get here?' were my rapid questions.
'Bruised; and my leg is hurt. How I got here is a long story.
Could you make me a little more comfortable, and get me a
drink?'</p>

<p>I shifted Rowlands into an easier position, then I started
back for the deck. I reached it, and as I emerged from it, I
caught sight of Caliban.</p>

<p>The boat was making no way, and there was a lot of rigging
still trailing over the side, so he had easily climbed back. I
made for the breakfast things as quickly as I could, revolver in
hand, and was happy to see the rifle still there. It would do to
threaten with anyhow. Caliban turned, and with an evil look on
his face shook his fist at me, and growled out a curse. But to my
surprise he did not move, and I got the water bag, some food, and
the rifle, and returned unmolested.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cause of it flashed across me. Caliban's revolver
had tumbled out of his pocket when he fell overboard. I
remembered that the slight roll of the vessel sent him a regular
somersault, and no doubt it dropped out then. Poor Caliban, how
much he would like to get his great paws on to me, but he
evidently had no heart for a bullet.</p>

<p>I wondered whether he had lost the knife, too. I gave Ned a
drink, and then persuaded him to let me help him on deck, as I
was horribly afraid that Caliban might shut us down.</p>

<p>When we were In the little forecastle, Ned munched some food,
and told me how he got there. It appears that during the night he
had made his way along forward to search for me. Thinking I was
in the forecastle, having missed me on deck, he went in there.
There he found Caliban, who had just emerged, and, I think, under
some mistaken notion, when Ned caught hold of him, and asked him
who he was, he gripped him in; return, and whether purposely, or
more likely by accident, threw him down the hatchway.</p>

<p>Of course, after our little tiff, it was not Caliban's policy
to tell me there was anyone aboard; that would mean two to one.
Ned had been lying half senseless all night, and his cries were
unheard through the noises the hull made. It was not until the
comparative quiet set in that I heard him.</p>

<p>I told Ned of my adventures with Caliban, and we agreed that
the situation was still very risky. We were two to one, but Ned
was well nigh crippled, and the four shots in the revolver, and
the empty rifle, were all we had to depend upon. Failing these,
the huge Caliban was more than a match for us, if it came to
close quarters. It was our business to prevent that, but as we
had to go to work to get a jury mast up, if there was spar left,
and to bend a sail on, it would tie very hard to avoid
treachery.</p>

<p>We started aft. Caliban still stood sullenly there, and I
ordered him to go forward, and stop there. There was no doubt he
had lost the revolver, for he went without a word. Then, when he
got there, he hailed me, and asked if I would give him a pipe and
tobacco.</p>

<p>As I wished to keep him quiet I did so, going forward and
throwing them to him. He filled and lit a pipe, and curling
himself up in the sun seemed quite contented. Ned fixed himself
up at the entrance of our cabin with the Winchester much in
evidence, and I went below and commenced a thorough overhaul,
which resulted in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>My great fear was that we were out of water, for goodness knew
how long we should be kicking about on that lonely sea. The water
cask lashed on deck was, of course, gone, but Ned had had a
little tank let in under the floor of our doll's cabin, and when
I tried that with the hand pump, I found it full. There was a
fair allowance of stores and a keg of rum, besides salt pork and
biscuit, so we could stand out a long time. When I had done, I
went forward and hailed Caliban, for I was determined he should
work his passage.</p>

<p>'Can you cook?' I asked.</p>

<p>'When I've got anything to cook;' he answered, surlily.</p>

<p>'Well, you must do that for us. I'm not going to trust you
aft.'</p>

<p>'Trust me! By Gar!' he said. 'Who can trust you? Without one
word of warning you knock me overboard.'</p>

<p>'Serve you right; you knew Rowlands was down there, and told
me a lie.'</p>

<p>'Well, what do you want?' he said, seemingly wishing to change
the subject.</p>

<p>'Hunt about down, below for a tin or old nail keg that will do
to make a fire in; then I'll give you some coffee and food to
cook.'</p>

<p>Caliban evidently wanted a hot meal as well as we did, and
went to work. He was, as I anticipated, handy enough, and he soon
found a tin and started a fire in it, and made some capital
coffee and a very decent meal. I gave him a nip of rum, and he
drank it off, remarking that he knew there was more where the
other came from. For a moment a wild idea came into may head of
making him dead drunk and heaving him overboard; but I could not
resort to such extreme measures without sufficient
provocation.</p>

<p>The weather still continued fine, and I searched about in vain
for a spar on which to bend a rag of sail of some kind. The
rudder had been well knocked about, but I found we could fix up
some sort of steering gear for it, and if the weather kept fine,
and the wind from the north-west, we should manage. But a spar
for a mast! We had been swept as clean as could be of everything.
Nothing bigger than a belaying pin, or less, firmly secured than
a ringbolt, had escaped being swept overboard.</p>

<p>I reported my non-success to Rowlands.</p>

<p>'Look about the sea,' said he. 'Some might be drifting about.
Look to windward; we would drift faster than wreckage.'</p>

<p>I looked to windward, but saw nothing. Then I hailed Caliban,
and told him to look to windward and see if he could see any
floating wreckage. He reared his tall form up and peered in the
wind, but for long there was no response, until presently he said
he thought he could see something occasionally on the top of a
swell. I went over, and he pointed it but to: me. I made out
something that certainly looked like wreckage, but it was too far
off to be of any advantage to us, and I went back disappointed
to Ned and told him.</p>

<p>'Pity we can't stick Caliban up for a mast,' he remarked,
'he's nearly tall enough.'</p>

<p>It was a curious predicament; we had spare sails below, but
how to get them spread without a spar was the question. The storm
had caught us unprepared; and the masts had gone clean, and the
stays being somewhat old had parted as though they had been cut.
Ned proposed to take up the deck planking and make some sort of a
spar out of some of the planks.</p>

<p>But here again arose a difficulty, I could not well do it by
myself, and Caliban would have to assist me. Now to put an axe or
adze into his hands meant to give him a weapon, and my belief in
Mr. Caliban was not enough to warrant that. He had no love for me
after the overboard incident, and he had no intention of going
back to Thursday Island if he could avoid it, so to give him the
chance to knock me on the head was distinctly foolish, as poor
crippled Rowlands would then be at his mercy.</p>

<p>The whole future bristled with difficulties, and I proposed to
Ned to shoot Caliban out of hand, as he seemed to be one of the
chief difficulties. I do not say I said it seriously, but if Ned
had entertained the idea I believe I should have felt inclined to
carry it out, as a solution of all difficulties. I was getting
Caliban on the brain.</p>

<p>However, Ned refused to agree to such a simple solution, and
we passed the day in fruitless conjectures and proposals.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Caliban, when I took him his evening meal, 'where
is your jury-mast and your sail? Why are we not on our way back
to Thursday Island? The wind, it is still north.'</p>

<p>The villain said this in such a mocking, insulting tone that I
felt inclined to repeat the overboard process, but it was
dangerous. Caliban might take me with him this time, so I
refrained and answered quietly that, I had not been able to find
spars or anything suitable, and that we must wait until picked
up. A British-India steamer was due a few days after we left
Thursday Island, and this would probably sight us.</p>

<p>'She goes to Batavia, does she not?' He asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. Port Darwin, and then Batavia.'</p>

<p>'That will suit me better than your jury mast. Come, now, it
is lonely here; I give you my word of honor that I will be a good
comrade, and attempt nothing. Let us live sociable and
together.'</p>

<p>I told him I would ask Ned about it, and really it seemed as
though there was really no harm to be feared. So long as we did
not go back to Thursday Island, Caliban had no earthly reason for
turning on us. The fact that the British-India steamer was due
had, to tell the truth, not struck me until that moment.</p>

<p>'Let him come,' said Rowlands, 'I don't see what advantage it
could be to him to do us any harm. We've got to stop here,
anyhow.'</p>

<p>I hailed Caliban and told him truce was proclaimed, and he
could come after, which he did immediately did, bringing his meal
with him. Certainly, he was a light-hearted scoundrel, and amused
and entertained us with tales of penal life in New Caledonia
which were gory in the extreme The evening was fine, and Caliban
and his stories made it pass quickly. I slept on deck, having
brought Ned's mattress and my own up, and spread them in the sun
all day. Caliban coiled himself down a short distance off, and I
for one was soon asleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened by Ned shaking me.</p>

<p>'See what Caliban is up to,' he whispered. His bruises made
him wakeful, and: he had seen our French friend go forward, and
he had not come back again. He handed me the revolver, which,
for safety, I had put under his head, and I crept cautiously
forward.</p>

<p>Caliban was not visible, but the little forehatch in the floor
of the forecastle was open, and down, that I went, but I did not
go far, for a thought struck me. I had told Caliban that he was
not to go into the after cabin, and had made our beds down in
front of the doorway. There was a hatch in the cabin, and Caliban
evidently thought that he could get there from the hold, but he
was mistaken; the hatch in the after cabin only opened into a
little lazarette.</p>

<p>The truth flashed across me: Caliban was after the rum. I
climbed out, and replaced the hatch, then went aft, and told Ned,
and, as it was not far off daylight and I had no other means of
securing the hatch, I took my mattress forward, and lay down on
it; I would give Caliban a surprise when he returned, which he
very shortly did.</p>

<p>He swore and pushed at the hatch, but could not move it, as it
was too high for him to put his back under, and when I got tired
of the nuisance, I called out to him, and told him he was going
to stay there for the present, and if he did not keep quiet I
would fire at him.</p>

<p>He implored and entreated to be let out; declared the rats
were attacking him, and other fables, to all of which I turned a
deaf ear. Finally, he desisted and when the sun rose I took the
hatch off, and told him to come up, and get breakfast. It was a
very penitent Caliban who slunk out, and when I taxed him with
going after the rum he did not deny it.</p>

<p>That day passed as uneventfully as the others Caliban made no
attempts to get the revolver, and apparently was going to keep
his word, but I felt mighty uncomfortable about him, and gave him
a nip of rum twice to keep him from trying to steal it. By the
time we went to bed he had counted up a homicidal list of about
twenty murders; most of them in cold blood.</p>

<p>To be cast away on a masterless ship, with a wholesale
murderer and a sick man as companion, was beginning to tell on my
nerves. When I awoke in the morning I cast a look around the now
quiet sunlit sea, and, what was my relief to see smoke on the
horizon. Was it going away from, us, or coming towards us?</p>

<p>She might have passed us unseen in the dark hours. I went and
told Ned the good tidings, and he managed to crawl to the stern,
which by chance was directed towards the direction the vessel was
appearing from; for; of course, we were being pitched about in
every direction.</p>

<p>Consulting the compass in the cabin, the steamer was to the
east, when gave us hope that it, was a B. and I. boat overtaking
us. And in half an hour this was proved evident, and if she only
passed close enough to see us, we were pretty sure of rescue.</p>

<p>Caliban joined; us In. our watch, and I suggested that, being
the tallest amongst us, he should stand on the most elevated
position, and wave an extemporised flag. This he agreed to this
as soon it was satisfactorily evident that it was a mail boat and
not a man-of-war sent to recapture him.</p>

<p>Reassured this point, he consented to act as signalman when
the steamer passed within reasonable distance. She came on, and
it seemed that fortune favoured us, as we seemed to be right in
her track. Nevertheless, Caliban took his station forward, ready
to wave a rug to show our distressful situation.</p>

<p>The steamer saw us, and stopped within hailing distance, while
we explained our condition. We only wanted a spar or two, and
would work back to Thursday Island, for we had no intention of
abandoning the hull of our taut little schooner. Nearer and
nearer the two vessels drifted, with the attraction that seems to
possess bodies afloat in the sea. The passengers crowded the near
side of the mail steamer, and Caliban marched up and down,
smoking a cigarette he had manufactured, with a swaggering air,
as though being on the deck of a dismasted schooner was a mere
episode in his varied experiences. A boat dropped from the davits
of the steamer, and a gangway was lowered; there was some
confusion at the top of the gangway, which was not understood by
us, then the boat came aboard. Catching the low gunwhale, the
officer sprang aboard, and was in immediately recognised by us as
an old friend, from the steamer passing Thursday Island so often.
In a few words our predicament was explained, and we found that
we could be easily supplied with what we wanted.</p>

<p>'Come aboard, will you?' said Jackson, the second officer of
the <i>Antarctica</i>. 'There's a lady passenger on board, who
says she recognised her husband on the deck of this schooner.
Didn't know that you or Rowlands were married men; but do come,
just to satisfy her.'</p>

<p>'We've a passenger on board whom you might take as far as Port
Darwin,' said Rowlands. He pointed to Caliban, who was standing
in a theatrical attitude with his arms folded.</p>

<p>'Very well; bring him, too,' said Jackson; 'only hurry up, the
old man will be performing directly.'</p>

<p>We got Rowlands into the boat, and Caliban followed; then we
mounted the steamer's gangway.</p>

<p><br>
WITH eyes like red-hot sparks, a little, sharp-featured woman
stood in front of a knot of passengers watching us step on deck.
The instant Caliban appeared she flew at him like a tigress, and
commenced to scratch and buffet his face. We looked on aghast.
Did the bold, devil may care throw her overboard in rage?</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort. The gigantic escapee simply put his hands
before his face, and whimpered in French to Marie to cease. The
humor of the situation was too strong for the spectators. We
could do nothing but giggle, until the captain stepped forward,
and said. 'Madame, is this your husband?'</p>

<p>'My husband!' she screamed. 'Yes, unfortunate that I am. The
coward, pig, villain, scoundrel, ran away from me.
<i>Me</i>&mdash;his wife! Ran from Cooktown, where we kept a
restaurant! Said he was tired of washing plates and dishes! But
what did I do? Gentlemen, I sold out at once, and followed him. I
heard of him at Thursday Island; but there I lost him. He had got
away unknown. Now I suppose these shipwrecked gentlemen gave him
passage.'</p>

<p>I had to speak.</p>

<p>'No,' I said; 'he stowed away, and we did not know of his
presence until after the storm that dismasted us. He gave us to
understand that he was an escaped convict from Noumea, and had
killed two guards when escaping.'</p>

<p>The woman broke into peals of hysterical' laughter.</p>

<p>'<i>He</i> kill two guards! <i>He</i> in Noumea! He was never
there in his life! He would tremble if I asked him to kill a
mouse! Did you not see that he is a liar and a maker or romances?
He amused our customers by telling of strange adventures; but as
for going through them? Well!' and the little Frenchwoman spread
out her hands in a most eloquent gesture.</p>

<p>So this was Caliban the Terror, who, instead of being a
convict with a homicidal career behind him, was a runaway husband
from a virago wife. If I could have gone overboard at that
moment, I should have been grateful.</p>

<p>'Behold!' cried the woman, as if to fill up my cup of
bitterness to the brim, 'how I treat this gallant man who could
kill two strong guards for his liberty,' and she smacked him
soundly on both cheeks.</p>

<p>As for Caliban, he only whimpered in French, and this was the
dare-devil I had been watching and dreading for days. Still, I
don't wonder he did not want to go back to Thursday Island. I
need say no more.</p>

<p>The skipper of the <i>Antarctica</i> proved a friend in need,
and fixed us up with all we wanted. A fellow I knew, a passenger,
decided to go back with us to Thursday Island, and wait over for
the next B. and I, just for the fun of the thing. The doctor saw
to Ned's bruises, and all went well, only I felt as though I
could have cheerfully strangled the erstwhile terrible Caliban.
But a worse fate awaited him, and when the steamer dipped her
flag and left us I pitied the poor devil.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. &mdash; A BUCCANEER'S DIARY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 9 and 16 Apr 1898</h3>

<h3>I. &mdash; THE DIARY</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was one thing to turn in to sleep quietly in your bunk, not
fearing any danger or trouble, and another to be awakened by the
thunder of pounding surf-waves and the swish of water on the
deck. As I tumbled out, the only thought in my mind was: 'Where
on earth have we got to?' Possibly it might have been put
stronger, and in a different form, but the fact remained that I
had to hurry on deck as fast as I could. Just as I reached the
door of our cuddy I was met full, by a sweeping sea, that
dashed me, stunned and half-drowned, under the table. How I
escaped drowning I know not, for when I came to my senses the
salt water was lapping my mouth. Needless to say, I scrambled up
as quickly as possible, and, the beating of the billows being now
somewhat lulled, I managed to grope my way on deck.</p>

<p>What a scene it was! By the light of a setting moon I could
see that we were on a reef, and had been hurled by the violence
of the breakers almost into safety, or, at least, such safety as
a dismasted wreck could find on the shallows of a coral reef. Not
a soul left; green, white-crested breakers all around, and a
ghostly moon lighting up the scene. Whether they strove to wake
me or not I cannot say, but recalling the hot words that had
passed between Captain Mordrassa and myself, I believe that I was
wilfully left to drown. There might have been several amongst the
crew who did not wish for my death; but in the confusion of
suddenly striking on this unknown reef they probably had no
chance to look after my safety.</p>

<p>I had commenced to heartily curse both Mordrassa and the
wine-bottle, which last was the cause of my sleeping so soundly,
when it occurred to me that probably I had the best of it, for
the boats could never have lived amongst the surf that stretched
around. I was confirmed in this belief by the sudden advent of a
dead body. A higher wave than usual threw it over the bulwarks,
at my feet. I stooped, to examine it, the hulk being now fast and
steady. It was the body of Mordrassa. Our quarrel was over and
settled.</p>

<p>Recovering myself somewhat, and my brain becoming clearer, I
looked around at the desolation that surrounded me. Astern was a
line of breakers; ahead was calm water; but no sign of land.
Above the horizon was the sickly, waning moon, and in the east
the flush of coming day. My position seemed pretty hopeless, but
it was better than Mordrassa's, and to settle matters between us
I proceeded to heave his body overboard again. I did not desire
his company, either alive or dead.</p>

<p>Then, as the dawn broke, clearer and brighter, I began to
ponder over the state of affairs. I was alive. In all probability
everybody else was dead. I owned the ship, which, was not, as
one can imagine, of much value; but I also owned the treasure
which should rightly belong to four and twenty souls&mdash;bad
souls, now in purgatory, no doubt.</p>

<p>Awed by this thought, I knelt down and vowed that if I was
rescued from my unfortunate position I would dedicate a large
portion of our piratical gains to religious purposes. I felt
better after this, and, the day being now bright and clear, I got
a little more confidence in myself, and returning to the cuddy,
still awash with water, I got some meat and a very comforting
bottle of wine, and after disposing of them returned on deck
again.</p>

<p>The poop was nearly dry, and I walked up and down meditating
what I should do with the treasure, and what sort of a house I
would build when I finally got away, when that confounded
Mordrassa turned up again. I really thought the fellow did it on
purpose, for an especially high wave cast him right over the poop
railings at my very feet. And he had an evil, mocking grin on his
face which no drowned man ought to wear. I thrust him overboard
again, and, I must confess, kicked him several times in doing
so.</p>

<p>Then I went down for another drink of wine, for Mordrassa had
annoyed me. Why couldn't the man keep quiet when he is dead? I
bethought me of the last words we had exchanged, nearly followed
by cutlass thrusts, and felt satisfied that I had been in the
right, and that if my little plan had succeeded, we should now be
safe and sound instead of being stuck on a reef.</p>

<p>Mordrassa asserted that the Southland of the Dutch was a mere
cluster of islands, and that we, coming from the east, after the
sack of Panama, could sail right through them and reach Africa,
which was foolish, but ingenious. But I held that the Dutch had
discovered a great continent, and that we should drive on to its
eastern coast. Quarrelling over this, I had induced a number of
the crew to join me in a mutiny and an attempt to seize the
command. We failed; Mordrassa's party proved too strong, and
after a bloody struggle we had to give in.</p>

<p>On account of my seamanship Mordrassa spared my life, with the
promise of yard-arming me as soon as we came in sight of land,
but this never happened, and up to the night of our wreck we
drank and quarrelled as usual, and now he was dead and I was
alive.</p>

<p>So far, so good; but where was I? If It was the Dutch
Southland, where was the bleak coast they described? Before me
was nothing but green patches of water, and broken belts of surf.
No sign of dry ground. All that day I took counsel with myself as
to the outcome of my desperate situation; and at intervals
Mordrassa came tumbling on board, until I got disgusted with his
conduct, and lashed him fast with a rope. After that I found some
comfort from him, for I used to talk to him, although not in a
complimentary manner, and it was a solace to have an old enemy
alongside whom one could abuse at leisure, and who could not
answer back.</p>

<p>But, reflect as I would, the matter seemed hopeless. I had the
ship and treasure surely enough, but what good was it to me? How
could I get away? I might in time build a boat, for had some
small skill in the matter, and that, I concluded, was the best
thing to do. When should I set to work? At once; but first, to
see that the treasure was safe, I went down to the lazarette, and
saw the cases, all safe and intact, as I hoped their contents
were. But I did not stop to examine them; Mordrassa came between
me and the work. Another big sea hove him on board, and trundled
him right through the cuddy on top of me.</p>

<p>Now this was disgusting. After lashing him safely, and, as I
thought, surely, it was a dastardly thing for a corpse to cut
itself loose and came tumbling down on top of a live man. I left
the lazarette and went on deck. Mordrassa could stop where he
was.</p>

<p>Next I commenced my boat building, and a weary, weary task it
was, and all through, the thought haunted me that if I could find
a passage through the reef I should find a continent to the
westward, the big continent of the Dutch, and from there I would
finally gain civilisation, and be able to make use of the
treasure. I built the boat, and by the time I had finished it
some nine months had passed. We had a store of 'boucan' on board,
which was not much injured by the wet, and on this, and on the
wines and other liquors, I lived.</p>

<p>And Mordrassa lived, too. When I say 'lived,' I mean that his
body did not decompose, but that every time I went near the open
trap of the lazarette his ugly face grinned up at me. The hulk
was now leaking badly, and full of water, but what annoyed me was
the thought that out of all who were drowned Mordrassa's body
should be the only one to come back. Was this on account of our
long enmity, the more bitter for its being concealed, that he
should thus haunt me after death? We had; sailed together for
years, and while he had always been ostensibly in command, he
well knew, which was not concealed between us, in private, that I
was the master spirit. Then, when we parted from Morgan and the
others, and started on this wild cruise across the Pacific, he
began to assume his foolish chieftain-kind of airs. That caused
the quarrel. I insisted on equal division; he refused. Now I have
it all.</p>

<p>Well, I am just about starting, and this is perhaps the last
opportunity I may have of writing. I have the boat ready, and
packed. The wreck is beginning to break up, and at daylight I
leave.</p>

<p><br>
'IS that your rendering, old man?' I said, when my mate had
finished reading thus far.</p>

<p>'Yes, but not mine altogether; my father wrote some of it out.
I have simply put it into readable English.'</p>

<p>'And you infer from it, so far as I can see, that the Great
Barrier Reef is the place where this buccaneering ancestor of
yours got wrecked?'</p>

<p>'Not my ancestor, but a great great uncle. Of what kin, I know
not. It's a sort of Ingoldsby Legend arrangement. He came home
and died, and this diary was found after his death, which was a
bad' death, I may tell you, according to all legends.'</p>

<p>'Of course I never dreamt of finding myself located in this
part of the world, but now, being on the Palmer Gold Field, and
doing no good, you and I, why not spend the rest of our money
looking up this treasure trove instead of sinking it in digging
useless holes in the ground?'</p>

<p>'Have you any more of the diary?'</p>

<p>'Not much, but what there is, is very pregnant with meaning.
The only thing is that we have to encounter Mordrassa's
ghost.'</p>

<p>'Are you afraid of ghosts?'</p>

<p>'Can't tell; never saw one; don't want to.'</p>

<p>'Well, according to the finish of this old buccaneer's diary,
Mordrassa is still keeping guard over the treasure.'</p>

<p>'So it was left behind, after all??'</p>

<p>'It was not exactly left behind, but rather returned. Anyhow,
it's there still, If we can only find it.'</p>

<p>'And you think we can?'</p>

<p>'I do. And if you will listen to the rest of the yarn you
will, too. Now, prepare for horrors.</p>

<p><br>
AND THAT was how it was that Nick Donken and I fell to
exploring the Barrier Reef, leaving behind the battered picks and
shovels we ineffectually labored with. What we found was more
than we bargained for.</p>

<h3>II. &mdash; THE DIARY (continued)</h3>

<p class="first">
PRIOR to getting the treasure, which had been stowed so that
it could be easily handled, I had tried my boat by taking a
cruise north and south of the reef during a spell of calm
weather. To the north I found a passage through the reef leading
west, and determined to follow, as my open boat would have better
weather inside than outside the reef. I got the treasure on
board, all the provisions I could muster, and started. But,
before I left, I went down and said good-bye to Mordrassa. I left
him with a few good wishes as to his soul, which he did not seem
to appreciate; then I stepped on board from the now nearly
water-logged hulk and sailed away.</p>

<p>The opening proving clear and easy of navigation, and the wind
and tide being in my favor, I was through it and in open water
again in about four tours. Before me was land, a low range rising
out of the western sea, and running north and south. The
continent of the Dutch Southland I had no doubt, and Mordrassa
was a fool after all, and I turned round to laugh in the
direction where I had left the wreck behind, and there was
Mordrassa following me.</p>

<p>This was outrageous! He was about a hundred yards behind,
coming on as though he was floating with the tide, and I managed
to persuade myself that the wreck had broken up since I left, and
the tide had brought him through a shorter passage than I had
overlooked. But I knew in my heart that this was not so.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was very offensive to a man of honor to be followed
up by a corpse like this. I began to hate the man worse dead than
I had when living. I resolutely kept my gaze ahead, and steered
for the shore, and landed on a little beach that evening. It was
pleasant to be on firm ground once more, but I had no intention
of stopping where I was. I had heard too much of the Dutch
Southland for that, and knew that it was only a land inhabited by
savage black cannibals.</p>

<p>No, I intended to cruise north until I had rounded the
northern cape, for there must be a northern cape somewhere, and
then make for the Dutch settlements in Java. I could speak Dutch,
and as we had been preying on the Spaniards, whom they hated,
they would be disposed to be friendly to me. But I must hide the
treasure somewhere. I knew enough of Dutchmen to know that they
would not stick at trifles.</p>

<p>So, for many days, with a fair south-east wind blowing, I
sailed north over a calm sea. And my dear friend Mordrassa
followed me. At last I reached the cape I knew must be there, for
the land turned and trended south, and before me, westward, was
an open sea. I landed and filled up my barracos with fresh water,
and then sailed boldly west. Six days, still with the steady
trade wind, I sailed without sighting land, and then the coast
rose before me again, and as I neared it I saw that it bore a
close resemblance to the land I had left. Could I still be on the
northern shore of the great Southland? And had I but crossed the
mouth of a large and deep gulf?</p>

<p>The next day these questions were answered for me in a most
unexpected manner. Rounding the point of a cluster of islands I
ran right into the middle of a fleet of Malay proas. There was no
chance of escape, for I could have been cut off easily, and there
was nothing to do but surrender at discretion, and my boat and I
were taken to the proa on which was the chief of the fleet.</p>

<p>He turned out to be a fat, oily, old rascal, of the name of
Ram Mung, and he could speak a little Dutch, so we were able to
understand each other fairly well. For all that he did not seem
very fond of the Dutch, and when I explained that I was not a
Dutchman he seemed inclined to be more friendly. I had some wine
left, and although it was not according to his religion, he made
no scruple of drinking it, in fact, drank all I had. Then he
asked me what I had in the little boxes, and, honesty being the
best policy, when you can't help yourself, I told him.</p>

<p>He said I was a good man and his brother, and if I would pay
him well he would take me to the Dutch at Batavia at the end of
the fishing season. This looked very well, but I began to suspect
that the payment of my passage would leave me but a very small
sum. But what was I to do? On the slightest pretext my throat
would be cut, and I should go to feed the fishes. So I grinned
assent.</p>

<p>Then Mordrassa commenced playing up! He frightened the crews
when they were at work. He appeared in all kinds of places in the
most unexpected manner, until their superstitious feelings were
aroused and they demanded my being put ashore.</p>

<p>Old Ram Mung called me into his little deck-house.</p>

<p>'My brother, I fear that there is something wrong and unholy
about these treasure boxes which you have not told to me. Why
should a dead man follow you from the great reef and persist in
stopping with us here, if Allah had not pronounced a curse upon
it? Now, tell me all in truth between brother and brother.'</p>

<p>Now I had to tell the truth, for I was sick of Mordrassa and
the villainous trickle was playing me. The facts were not as I
have stated at the commencement. True, Mordrassa quarrelled the
night of the wreck, but it ended with his telling me that the
first piece of dry land we sighted, with a tree on it high enough
to hang me on, I should be hung straight away.</p>

<p>After uttering this threat the fool, being pot valiant with
the wine we had drank, turned to go on deck. Needless to say, I
did not neglect such an opportunity, and before he could utter a
cry, for he was going to call to the men to put me in irons, my
knife was in his back to the hilt. That is the truth, but I did
not write it down before in case of somebody making trouble about
it. But now, considering that after all it was only in self
defence, I put down the truth. Old Ram Mung grinned, for he saw
no evil in it; it was just what he would have done under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Then he went on to inquire into the cause of a quarrel so
deadly. And I told him that Mordrassa wished for a division of
the spoil on the principle of one-third to himself, one-third to
be divided amongst the officers, and the other third amongst the
crew. This I maintained was unfair, and asserted that one-half
should be divided between him and myself, and the other half in
proportion amongst the crew.</p>

<p>'And,' said Ram Mung, 'you brought the whole of the treasure
away with you? Speak truly, oh, brother!'</p>

<p>'I brought the whole away, I swear.' I replied.</p>

<p>'It was not well done. Mordrassa follows you to obtain his
share, and that of his crew. It must be returned to him, or he
may bring a storm on us that will sink my fleet.'</p>

<p>This was nice hearing, all for the sake of a sodden swab of a
corpse! The old Malay thought for some time, then he ordered me
to be confined, while he consulted with his men on the other
proas. A day and night passed before I was called to him, and
then he said they had determined what to do in order to get rid
of the evil spirit which would assuredly bring them bad luck, if
not death.</p>

<p>This was the plan, and a pretty plan too. My rightful share of
the treasure was to be kept, and the remainder sent back in a
proa to the scene of the wreck. I was to go back in the proa and
point out the place, so the spirit would rest. Naturally, I
foamed with rage, but it was of no use, back I had to go; but
before the day was out I had matured a scheme that I thought well
of.</p>

<p>The rascals with me had no desire to make a long trip of it,
and I determined to find a place a good deal nearer, where I
could some day return and get it. Just before I came to the north
cape I had passed through a narrow passage between an island and
the mainland. The spot was unmistakable. I would point out the
southern end as the place where the ship had been wrecked, end
there the treasure could await my coming.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Mordrassa did not follow us back. Perhaps he
was now satisfied. I was very glad, for he might possibly have
made himself disagreeable, insisting that was not the right
place. However, the thing was done, and I saw the boxes buried
near the southernmost point of the island. Back we came, and,
found that the season was nearly over, and the fleet preparing to
sail.</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen of Mordrassa after we left, and the old
admiral, or whatever he called himself, was beaming and friendly.
No wonder, the scurvy rascal! He made out a bill against me for
the whole of my chare&mdash;charged me with the cost of sending
the proa back, the shares the men lost in the fishery while they
were away, etc. Never did I meet with a man who could make out a
better bill. The Jews I had had dealings with would have blushed.
Finally, when he landed me at Batavia, he gave me a few coins,
because 'he loved me like a brother.' Over and over again I,
would have risked my carcass by stabbing him, but that the
thought of the buried treasure on the island kept my temper down
and my spirits up. There I was, stranded in Batavia; and but that
I met a seafaring man I had once sailed with, who helped me to a
ship, I should have rotted there.</p>

<p><br>
'HERE,' said Donken, 'ends the diary proper. It is certain,
however, that the author of it went another voyage, and returned
home as poor as when he started. He died, raving of the tortures
he would inflict upon Mordrassa and Rum Mung when he met them in
hell.'</p>

<p>'Then he did not find the treasure?'</p>

<p>'Apparently not. Something must have happened to prevent
him.'</p>

<p>'Then you think the treasure is still where he buried it the
second time?'</p>

<p>'I do, and propose to go and look for it'</p>

<p>'Do you think you can locate the place?'</p>

<p>'Easily. The narrow passage be speaks of, between an island
and the mainland, must be the one now called Albany Pass. The
island, on the southern end of which the treasure was buried, is
Albany Island.'</p>

<p>'And where he met the Malay fleet?'</p>

<p>'Must be Cape Wessel. There are many groups of islands
there.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I replied, 'I am tired of gold digging without the
gold, so I'll put my little pile in to it.'</p>

<p>So we went.</p>

<p><br>
WE both of us could manage a boat, and, luckily, found one for
sale at Cooktown that just suited us. We should only want a
colored man to cook and give a hand if necessary. We had to
invent a story to account for our presence on Albany Island, for
there was a station on the mainland, just opposite; but we made
up a yarn about being quasi-scientific individuals examining the
structure of the Great Barrier Reef, and they soon took little
interest in us.</p>

<p>Over and over again we tried until we were tired, and I was
losing heart, and still no trace of buried boxes could we find;
or, supposing those had decayed, no trace of their contents.</p>

<p>'That old buccaneer must have come back and got his treasure,
after all,' said I to Nick, as he was delving away one
afternoon.</p>

<p>Just as I said this Nick's pick struck on something metallic.
He stooped and disinterred it. It was a rust-eaten iron clamp,
that had once held a box together. Naturally, we became rather
excited, and Nick worked like his ancient namesake. Finally, we
got out enough ironwork to construct the frame of a
firmly-clamped box of small size, but no trace of the
contents&mdash;nothing but what appeared like decayed shell. We
looked at each other in consternation. Then Nick wielded his pick
again. By evening we had arrived at the same result&mdash;the
ironwork of another box, but no coin or anything of value.</p>

<p>We discussed the question over the camp fire until late. All
we could make out of it was that the buccaneer had not returned,
or the boxes would have been disturbed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nick exclaimed, 'I have it. That rascally old Malay
had him nicely on toast.'</p>

<p>'Who?' I asked. 'That thieving old pirate. What a flat he must
have been after, all.'</p>

<p>'Explain.'</p>

<p>'Why you are as bad as he was. Of course the Malay never sent
the treasure back. He emptied the boxes and filled them up again
with rubbish; but he kept the treasure, and planted it
somewhere.'</p>

<p>'It's very likely. And his superstition was all assumed?'</p>

<p>'To a great extent, but I don't think altogether. Anyhow, I
believe he chanced it, and stuck to the loot.'</p>

<p>'It seems so. Anyhow, we're up a tree as far as it is
concerned.'</p>

<p>'Think so, too. Good-night!'</p>

<p>We turned over, and were silent, but I could not sleep. What
did the old Malay do with the treasure, and why did not the
persistent ghost of Mordrassa follow them back? Of course because
the treasure was not there. If the treasure remained on board the
fleet, why did not the spook persist in annoying them?</p>

<p>For a very good reason. Because the treasure had been
concealed on Cape Wessel, or the islands about there; and if not
taken away again there it was still. And probably Mordrassa's
ghost as well.</p>

<p>I was so excited by the conclusion I had worked out that I
could not refrain from waking Nick and telling him. At first he
was rather uncomplimentary, but when he got fully awake be
consented to agree with me. Then we discussed ways and means, and
it was nearly daylight before we knocked off.</p>

<p>Thursday Island was but a day's sail, and there we could
obtain a further supply of provisions, and watch our chance for a
slant of fine weather to cross the mouth of the gulf. All this
came off, and we arrived safely at Cape Wessel and commenced our
search. We proceeded on different methods. I went round to all
the old Malay camps and investigated. Nick persisted in shifting
camp every night, in the hope of seeing Mordrassa's ghost, and
Nick succeeded.</p>

<p>It was on one of the southernmost of the Wessel Islands Group
that I was awakened one night by something sobbing in the
darkness surrounding our camp. I awakened Nick softly, and we
both listened. Certainly there was a sound like sobbing going on.
We peered cautiously out into the darkness, but could see
nothing.</p>

<p>'Make up the fire,' suggested Nick. I thought this bad advice,
but acted on it, and soon a little dry drift wood made the blaze
leap up and shed a bright light round. Then Nick gave a horrified
gasp, and I felt rather like crying out too.</p>

<p>Out of the darkness came a head, a head, and no body&mdash;a
ghastly, sodden, bleached, and dead head, the hair clotted with
barnacles and seaweed; the sockets, with the eyes eaten out of
them; and the lips had been gnawed by fish. The head of a
nightmare, to haunt one to one's dying day. And the dreadful
thing gave vent to a lamentable cry, and faded out of sight.</p>

<p>'Mordrassa!' cried Nick, and covered his eyes with his hands,
as if to shut out the recollection. Needless to say, we slept no
more, but watched until the welcome daylight broke in the east,
and we regained a little courage.</p>

<p>As the day grew brighter our courage grew stronger, and Nick
opined that we were close to the hidden treasure, and had better
start searching. We did so, and continued without success all
day. In the evening we went down to the beach for a swim, but we
had hardly been in ten minutes before Nick swore that he saw
Mordrassa's head floating and tossing on the waves, and we bolted
ashore.</p>

<p>'Now Nick,' I said, when we had dressed, 'this sort of thing
must net go on. We're evidently on the right track, and we must
not submit to be bullied out of the thing by an old drowned
ghost.'</p>

<p>'No, we mustn't,' agreed Donken. 'We must treat this spook
with the contempt he deserves. Who is he? An antiquated ghost,
who has had his day, and we'll tell him so if he turns up again
to-night.'</p>

<p>We shook hands on this, and went back to camp. The colored
man, who slept like the seven sleepers, had heard nothing the
night before, so he was not frightened; but whether or no, he
couldn't run away, if he wanted to.</p>

<p>I lay awake, listening to the lapping of the wavelets and the
sighing of the wind, when I heard the sobbing again.</p>

<p>'Here comes that old fraud, Nick,' I said aloud.</p>

<p>'I hear him,' he replied, 'and I'll throw something at his
ugly head if he shows it again.'</p>

<p>This reply reassured me that Nick was keeping his heart up.
Presently the sobbing came nearer, and once again the frightful
head came into the circle of light.</p>

<p>'Clear out,' cried Nick, jumping up, or I'll blow a Government
road through you.'</p>

<p>The thing never moved.</p>

<p>Dick fired. The colored man leaped to his feet in alarm. The
face was still there, but now it burned with a blue
phosphorescent light, and moved away, instead of disappearing
like it did the night before.</p>

<p>'Come on,' cried Nick, 'we must follow it; it may lead us to
the place.'</p>

<p>At this the Manila man set up a lugubrious howl of fright,
but, without regarding him, we followed the light on the head.
Not far, not above 100 yards or so, and then it began to grow
dim, and die out. Nick and I both rushed forward, and, as it
disappeared, marked the spot with whatever sticks and stones we
could find handy in the dark.</p>

<p>'Thank you, old man!' I cried, and we returned to camp to find
the Manila man, groaning horribly, with his head in the
blankets.</p>

<p>Next morning, bright and early; we were afoot, and commencing
operations at the marked spot. An hour's digging brought us to
same bones, but so decayed that we could not tell what they
belonged to, but we presumed they had once been a man's. Next
came a Malay kris, large and ornamented, but it would require
cleaning thoroughly before one could say much about it. Besides
the kris were some ornaments, buckles, and other rubbish.</p>

<p>'Seems as if somebody had been buried here with his clothes
on,' said Nick. And then somebody laughed.</p>

<p>'Was that you?' we asked together; but it was neither of us,
nor was it the Manila man, for we could hear him moving about the
camp. We agreed that it was a 'jackass,' although we knew very
well it was not. So we dug on, and at last came to a few coins,
not much, nor representing a very gaudy 'treasure.'</p>

<p>We dug about there for nearly a month, and found a silver
crucifix or two, a few rings and chains and other things; and now
and again we heard that laugh. At last, when we had opened up a
fair-sized agricultural patch, we knocked off, and started
cleaning our 'treasure.'</p>

<p>It did not total anything worth speaking of. The coins were
all silver, so were the images and crucifixes. The rings were
gold, with a few stones in them. The only thing of value was the
Malay kris, which had some fairly valuable jewels set in its
hilt. Altogether, when we deducted the cost of
everything&mdash;the Manila man's wages, and the trouble end
danger we had undergone&mdash;we had made about £100 apiece,
after paying for everything. No wonder that old ghost
laughed!</p>

<p>But the strangest thing of all is that when the kris was
cleaned and polished we found Arabic characters engraved on the
blade. The Manila man deciphered them thus: 'The is the weapon of
Ram Mung.'</p>

<p><br>
IF anyone wants to go treasure-seeking there is a chance for
them on South Wessel Island: they can't mistake the place.</p>

<p>Nick and I solved the affair after this fashion: Ram Mung
returned for what he had buried, and took the crew of his proa
ashore to dig it up, and carry it on board. When they had got it,
the crew knocked old Ram Mung on the head, and tumbled him into
the hole, all standing. Then they departed, and Mordrassa
frightened seven bells out of them, and they all came to grief.
Now, Mordrassa is amusing himself at the expense of anyone who
comes looking for the treasure. He's just the sort of ghost to
play a mean trick of that sort.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. &mdash; THE GRASP OF THE DEAD</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF THE TIME OF THE FRENCH COMMUNE</h3>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 10 Nov 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
IN the town of Louviers, in France, there resided an English,
doctor named Cranstone. Late one night an old woman&mdash;a
countrywoman of his&mdash;came to him with a short note,
requesting his immediate attendance.</p>

<p>'How is M. Varillon?' he asked, after glancing at the few
words the note contained.</p>

<p>'Dead,' replied the dame; 'died this morning.'</p>

<p>'And Madame?'</p>

<p>'Miss Lucy is staying with me, and she wants you to go with
her to-night to see her husband.'</p>

<p>'To see her husband! You say that he is dead?'</p>

<p>'He's as bad dead as he was living; but she'll tell you all
about it.'</p>

<p>Without more questions, the doctor accompanied the old woman;
and they presently reached a little cottage, the interior of
which presented a mixed jumble of French and English furniture.
Sitting by the fire burning in an open fireplace was a fair-faced
girl, unmistakably English, whom the doctor addressed as Mme.
Varillon. It was some time before she mooted her real object in
sending for him; and then she watched his face narrowly with her
big hazel eyes, as if dreading ridicule.</p>

<p>'He made me promise,' she said, speaking of her dead husband,
'that for the 'two nights before he would-be buried I would come
and pray beside his body, and watch there from 2 o'clock until
daylight.'</p>

<p>'What a ridiculous request,' replied the doctor.</p>

<p>'However, you are certainly not strong enough to redeem your
promise, so you can make up your mind for a good night's
rest.'</p>

<p>'But I must go.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense; it might be the death of you. Why send forme, if
you won't take my advice?'</p>

<p>'It was not for your advice I asked you to come,' she said
pleadingly, 'but to ask a greater favor. I must go, but I
confess I feel timid. Will you come with me?'</p>

<p>'Of course I will. I should not have dreamt of allowing you to
go alone.'</p>

<p>'There's nobody in the house but old Jeanne, and she sleeps
below; the <i>Soeur de Charité</i> leaves at nightfall.'</p>

<p>'I will go, too. Miss Lucy,' said the old woman. 'No, nurse; I
won't let you come. You know I shall be safe with Dr.
Cranstone.'</p>

<p>'What could he mean by such a whim?' said the doctor
petulantly.</p>

<p>'I can scarcely tell you what he said,' and her voice dropped,
and she glanced fearfully round her. 'He seemed to fear that
somebody&mdash;somebody not living, you know&mdash;might come to
his body if I was not there.'</p>

<p>'Gracious me, what nonsense,' grumbled the old nurse. 'Who'd
like to go near his ugly old body, if they could help it, I
should like to know?'</p>

<p>'Go to bed at once, and dismiss these notions,' said the
doctor.</p>

<p>'I must go; I feel I must.'</p>

<p>'A wilfu' woman maun gang her own fetit,' muttered the doctor;
'but if we must go I see no reason for leaving this snug room
until necessary. I, for one, object to doing more penance than I
can help.'</p>

<p>The doctor made another fruitless attempt to dissuade Mme.
Varillon from her purpose, and after 1 o'clock they were
traversing the deserted streets. They reached a gloomy square, on
one side of which rose the dark towers of a church, the remaining
three sides consisted of tall houses. High up in one of these a
dim light shone through a window, and before this house they
stopped.</p>

<p>Cranstone had only attended M. Varillon at the beginning of
his illness, and then some fancy of the sick man's made him call
in another doctor, and Cranstone's visits ceased. With his
compatriot, Mme. Varillon, he had, however, kept up an
acquaintanceship that had ripened into friendship.</p>

<p>After pulling at the bell for some time, somebody in the
porter's lodge seemingly awoke, for a small door cut in the large
one opened, and the doctor and his companion entered. The hall
was intensely dark, and the air close and unwholesome, as if the
place was always shut up.</p>

<p>Mme. Varillon, knowing the place better, took the doctor's
hand, and led him towards the stairs. They, too, were unlighted,
save by such meagre starlight as struggled in through the
uncleaned windows; and as the doctor followed his silent guide be
could scarcely help a thrill of superstitious fear from creeping
over him.</p>

<p>They stopped at the third storey, and entered the room, where
burned the light they had seen in the street. In one corner of
the room stood a heavy, old-fashioned bedstead, and on it lay the
dead. A flickering candle burnt on either side of the corpse, and
on the breast lay a wreath of immortelles. The girl looked on the
dead with a half-terrified gaze, and then throwing back her cloak
knelt beside the bed, and, burying her face in her bands, seemed
to pray.</p>

<p>Cranstone stood beside her, and looked curiously round the
place, which he had only seen by daylight under different
condition's. It was a large room, and the furniture in it was old
and costly, the uncertain light of the two candles only
illuminated that portion of the room in the immediate
neighborhood of the bed, the far corners of the room were
shrouded in grim obscurity.</p>

<p>Having finished his unsatisfactory survey, Cranstone looked at
the corpse. The face was that of a man above middle age,
evidently of a stern, forbidding aspect during life, and now
looking doubly so during death. The hair and pointed beard were
dark, streaked with grey, and contrasted in a ghastly manner with
the white face. Cranstone wondered again, as he had wondered
before, how the sweet-faced girl kneeling at the bed had come to
marry such, a man.</p>

<p>Cranstone looked at the face of the corpse more intently, and
he could scarcely repress a shuddering sensation that, from under
the closed lids, the eyes of the dead man were looking angrily
and fiercely at him. Impressed, in spite of himself, he looked
almost savagely, and strove to discard the unholy sensations that
were creeping into his mind and causing him to stand there,
weirdly fascinated, gazing into a lifeless face.</p>

<p>The spell was broken by Mme. Varillon rising from her knees.
She gathered her cloak about her as though she felt cold, and,
stooping over the corpse, put her left hand in one of the
lifeless ones, and, resting her right one on the bed, bent down
as if about to impress a farewell kiss on the cold lips. In the
very act she started back with a quick cry of pain and terror; a
cry that seemed to the astonished doctor to be mockingly
re-echoed throughout the building.</p>

<p>'My hand! My hand!' she gasped, in horror-stricken accents.
Startled and astonished, Cranstone saw, to his dismay, that the
dead hand had closed upon the living one the girl had laid upon
it. No other change or motion was visible in the body; the set
face showed no sign of returning life; but the bony hand had
grasped the delicate one that had rested on it, and was crushing
it in a fell grasp that made the sufferer wince with agony.</p>

<p>Recovering to a certain extent his presence of mind, Cranstone
caught hold of the wrist of the corpse with one hand, and with
the other tried to disengage Mme. Varillon's hand. But he failed
in releasing the hold of the fingers in the slightest degree.
Again he essayed, putting forth all his strength, and using both
hands in his endeavors to wrench the hand open, but still in
vain. Excited and incensed by the sight of the girl's suffering,
Cranstone strained every muscle, throwing his whole will and
energy into his endeavor to free the tortured imprisoned hand.
This time he seemed, to have made some impression on the iron
clasp, but it required the exertion of all his strength to retain
the slight advantage he had gained.</p>

<p>He realised that it was a struggle' of mental rather than
physical power. He felt that a mind of equal power' and
determination was opposed to him, and the combative faculty was
so equally balanced that one supreme effort must give the
victory.</p>

<p>The horrible notion that an unknown being of another world was
in the once-breathing form, and fighting him for the possession
of the living hand, made him almost shudder at the contact of the
cold, dead flesh; and he at once felt the fingers closing with
renewed tenacity. Enraged at his own weakness, he strove to
banish from his mind every feeling of terror at supernatural
influence, and threw his utmost vigor into his tired and
straining muscles. He felt, to his joy, that now he was
succeeding, and that the rigid hold was failing beneath his
desperate clasp. Animated by this, he essayed his utmost to
accomplish his object, when the clock in the neighboring church
struck 3.</p>

<p>At the first stroke, and with a suddenness that&mdash;coming
so unexpectedly&mdash;caused him to almost lose his balance, the
dead hand opened, and the girl with a low shuddering moan dropped
fainting on the floor. Cranstone raised her at once, and looked
vainly round the room for water. Noticing a door other than the
one he had entered by, he took one of the candles and went and
opened it. It was evidently a dressing-room, and in it he saw the
water he sought. A low couch was in there, too, and thinking that
his patient, when she recovered would be better out of the
presence of the dead body, he carried her in and laid her on
it.</p>

<p>After bathing her temples with the cold water, he examined her
hand. So severe had been the grasp to which it had been subjected
that the blood was oozing from beneath the finger nails, two of
the bones of the palm of the hand were broken, and the rings she
wore were bent and pressed into the flesh. After dressing the
injured member as well as he could, he went to inspect the dead
man. Here he was entirely at fault; no trace of life could he
discover. Every test that his professional knowledge suggested he
put into practice, but without result. The man was dead, and had
evidently been so for some time.</p>

<p>Just as he had finished his inspection of the body, the noise
of the door through which he had first entered being opened
attracted his attention. Holding up the remaining candle, he
turned round. The door opened slowly, and a woman came into the
room, and advanced to the side of the bed. She was robed in a
loose gown, her long hair hanging in disorder down her back. Two
dark, wistful eyes looked out of a pale, handsome
face&mdash;eyes, solemn, sad, and holding in their depths the
memory of some secret horror that gave them the fixed, abstracted
look of insanity.</p>

<p>She took no notice of Cranstone, who had put down the light,
and stood silent and fascinated&mdash;a sensation of awful
o'ermastering fear almost overwhelming him as this ghostly figure
came to the bedside. She stood regarding the dead body for some
time, her eyes fixed in a set stare of hate, her hands clasped
loosely in front of her, and Cranstone noticed with a fresh
access of horror that a hideous gash was across one of her
wrists, nearly severing it to the bone.</p>

<p>The blood was dripping on the floor with a perfectly audible
splash; but do what he would, the doctor could not move or speak.
Presently the silent figure turned, and went into the room where
lay the still insensible girl. She paused beside the couch, still
visible to Cranstone through the open door. Suddenly she lifted
her wounded arm, and, holding it over the prostrate form on the
couch, let the blood trickle on Mme. Varillon's forehead.</p>

<p>Breaking the charm that held him by a mighty effort, the
doctor sprang forward with an exclamation of horror. He saw the
woman look menacingly at Mm as he advanced, he saw the girl's
face with the disfiguring bloodstains on it, and then, to his
astonishment, the standing figure vanished, and when he reached
the side of the couch the insensible face on the pillow was as
fair and pure as it had been before.</p>

<p>Doubting the evidence of his own senses, and utterly
mystified, the doctor stood bewildered for a few moments. Then he
recalled his coolness, and stepped out on the dark landing,
closed the door behind him, and listened, patient and motionless,
but could not detect the slightest sound in any part of the
house. Dense darkness and absolute silence seemed to reign
everywhere.</p>

<p>He returned to the room, and tried to reason himself into the
belief that it was all an illusion. It was a creation of his own
imagination, the premonitory symptom of an illness perhaps. Such
things had been in his experience. But when he looked at the
bruised hand of his patient, who was beginning to recover, he had
to confess that something had happened that was beyond his
philosophy.</p>

<p>It was some time before Mme. Varillon was sufficiently
restored to return to the old nurse's cottage; and as the
slightest allusion to the scene through which they had passed
seemed to excite her, the doctor forbore to press for any
information&mdash;even if she could have given any. He deemed it
his duty, however, to look up the doctor who had succeeded him in
attendance on M. Varillon, and see if any symptoms of trance had
shown themselves.</p>

<p>Dr. Buvert proved very communicative, and did not seem to
trouble himself about his confrere's motives for making; the
inquiries. Without much diplomacy he was led to talk of
Varillon's past life.</p>

<p>'He was married before,' he said, 'to a woman whose heart and
soul were given to another. She was forced by her parents to
marry Varillon, a cold, stern, abstracted man; and you can fancy
how happy she was. Well, the result was inevitable. The lovers
met again, and Varillon heard of it. He gave no sign; he bided
his time.</p>

<p>'Her lover&mdash;his name was d'Heristal&mdash;ventured into
the house to bid her a last farewell. They reckoned on the
husband's absence; they were deceived. When about to separate,
his step was heard coming slowly and deliberately towards the
room. There was no escape; from the window to the ground was over
forty feet at least, and there was but one door&mdash;that by
which Varillon would enter directly.</p>

<p>'Anxious to screen her from shame, and not to save
himself&mdash;for all stories unite in giving him the character
of a bold young fellow&mdash;d'Heristal got out of the window,
and, standing upon the precarious footing afforded by the
ornamental portion of the facade beneath the old-fashioned
window, stooped down low, sustaining himself by one hand on the
window-sill. Varillon came into the room, and his quick eye at
once saw the hand on the window-sill, for, in her alarm, Mme.
Varillon never thought of diminishing the light in the room.</p>

<p>'Varillon said nothing of what he suspected, but, after a few
ordinary remarks to the trembling woman, he caught her by the
hand and tried to lead her to the window. She knew at once that
all was known, and concluding that his intention was to hurl her
lover into the street before her eyes, struggled and prayed for
mercy. Silently ignoring her entreaties, he dragged her towards
the window. A slight scuffling noise was heard. D'Heristal,
doubtless in an attempt to get back in the room, hearing what was
going on, had dislodged with his weight the old bricks, and the
unfortunate man was suspended by his hands over the pavement,
fifty feet below.</p>

<p>'Varillon must have guessed what had happened, for, with
renewed persistence, he strove to drag his wife to the window to
witness the fall that must take place; and she, in despair,
caught up a knife from the supper-table, and gashed herself
across the wrist, as if in an insane effort to cut herself free
from his relentless grasp.'</p>

<p>'And what was the end?' asked Cranstone, as the other
paused.</p>

<p>'D'Heristal, when his strength gave way, fell to the ground,
and was killed instantly. She bled to death, and he had almost
crushed her hand in his attempt to drag her to the window. Some
of the metacarpal bones were broken, and the rings on her fingers
bent and squeezed into the flesh.'</p>

<p>'And at what time did this happen?'</p>

<p>'The servant, who admitted Varillon, and who was watching and
listening at the door and through whom the facts transpired, said
that at the instant she drew the knife across her wrist the clock
of St. Marguerite struck 3.'</p>

<p>'How many years ago did this occur?'</p>

<p>'About five years ago. There was some talk about it as you can
imagine; and Varillon wisely went away to live in England. When
he returned about twelve months ago he brought your pretty
countrywoman back as his bride. How she was induced to marry him
I cannot imagine: doubtless her parents were poor, and she was
little more than a schoolgirl. However, she is a rich widow now,
a better fate than she would have had as his wife. I wonder he
even allowed that old nurse to accompany her.'</p>

<p>Buvert, having once started, seemed inclined to gossip on for
ever; but Cranstone, having gained all he wanted to know, managed
to escape as soon as he could consistent with politeness.</p>

<p><br>
IT WAS more than a month before Mme. Varillon was strong
enough to leave for England. Cranstone escorted her to Paris, and
turned from watching' the departing train with the settled
conviction that he was over head and ears in love, that he was a
poor man, and, she was a rich widow, and that the best thing he
could do was to forget about her as speedily as possible. Easier
said than done, three and four years' hard work in his profession
did not do it.</p>

<p>Then came the war with Prussia, the siege of Paris, the
outbreak of the Commune, and the second siege of the city by the
Versailles troops. Cranstone saw it all through, and in the
hospitals amongst the wounded, or doing his voluntary work under
the Prussian guns, had ever before him the remembrance of those
soft brown eyes. An unwilling worker under the Commune, he still
tended their wounded, hoping for the incoming of the Versailles
troops.</p>

<p>The day of retribution came, at last and the streets of Paris
became a red battle field. Trusting to the cross of Geneva for
protection From both sides, Cranstone sallied out to see how
things were going. He had gained a comparatively quiet street,
when lie saw the scarlet facings of a band of communists at the
head of it coming towards him.</p>

<p>Knowing that he might probably be shot out of mere wantonness,
he tried to gain entrance in the nearest house until they had
passed, and the assurance that he was a doctor obtained him
admittance from the porter. While talking to the man about the
fighting going on, an old woman looked into the porter's room,
gave vent to an exclamation of boy, and rushed forward and caught
him by the hand. It was Mme. Varillon's old nurse.</p>

<p>Not waiting to answer the doctor's rapid questions, she
dragged him by the hand, and led him upstairs. All the doctor
could understand from her incoherence was a reproach directed
against himself for never having communicated with her
mistress.</p>

<p>'And then,' said the garrulous old dame, 'We couldn't live out
of Paris, where you might be, for we knew you had left Louviers,
and so got shut up in this awful place, where they are always
killing one another, and have been nearly starved.'</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of a room on the first
floor, and the doctor, with a beating heart, followed the
impetuous old dame, who burst in crying, 'I have found him! I
have got him!'</p>

<p>And there was the love he had tried to forget. They did not
enter into explanations, they were unnecessary, but perhaps the
crash of firearms In the street beneath the window frightened her
so that she had to take shelter in the doctor's arms; but that
was a noise she should have been accustomed to. Be that as it
may, she was there, and in the street a body of Versailles troops
had met the Communists, and were having it out with them.</p>

<p>As she lifted her face to meet her lover's caress, she fell on
his breast with a quick gasp of pain. A random bullet had found
its way through the ill-barricaded window, and taken her
life.</p>

<p>The agonised doctor laid her on the couch. Yes, even as he had
seen her in the haunted room with the ghastly blood stain on her
white forehead, she lay with the death wound in her brow. The
omen was accomplished; he had found his love, but to lose her.
And clear 'midst the shots and shouts of the combatants a little
clock on the mantelpiece rang out the fatal hour of 3.</p>

<p>For a few moments Cranstone stood motionless and speechless,
then, after one long kiss on the lifeless lips, he turned and
sought the street. The Communists had retreated behind a
barricade hastily thrown up at the end of the street, and their
opponents were about to charge it. The doctor stooped over a dead
body and took the <i>chassepot</i> from the still hand; then, as
if struck with another idea, threw it aside and preferred the
sword bayonet.</p>

<p>The Versailles troops carried the barricade after a desperate
hand-to-hand struggle, during which they lost half their number.
Of the Communists not a man escaped&mdash;they fell where they
stood.</p>

<p>'My faith!' said the corporal, now by the loss of both his
officers in command of the party, 'But if all the citizens had
fought like that one lying there, the <i>Comité Central</i> could
never have existed.'</p>

<p>His men, looking for their own wounded and dispatching any
insurgent who showed signs of life, had just thrown on one side
the dead body of the English doctor.</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. &mdash; A TRAGEDY OF EARS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 23 Apr 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
'IS that your dog?' I asked the traveller, as he stood at the
door of the store on Ramstead head station.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's my dawg, and a good dawg, too, though he ain't no
beauty.'</p>

<p>He certainly was not a beauty; his ears had been bitten and
torn out of all shape and form; he was scarred, and one of his
legs had been broken, and he travelled with a limp. His breed was
anything; but he had a sharp, plucky look about him, and a
wistful, comical eye&mdash;so wistful that, it being lulling
morning, I gave him that muscular piece of the bullock popularly
known as the 'New England tongue.'</p>

<p>Some of the station dogs resented this, and made signs of
taking it; away from him; but the stranger rounded on them with
such a sudden and angry snarl, every bristle of his back erect,
that, being full of meat and not 'fighting fit,' they thought
better of it.</p>

<p>The man wanted some rations, and while giving them out to him
I could not help noticing a queer resemblance between him and his
dog. And, to further add to it, he, too, had lost a portion of
one ear. We had no work for him on the station, but I told him he
could stop the night and spell his horses if he liked. He had
two, and first-rate nags they were.</p>

<p>He saw me look at them, and remarked: 'Yes, that's been my
weakness always&mdash;a fine woman and a fine horse,
sir&mdash;and I don't mind owning to it.'</p>

<p>He said it in a way that was so genuine that you really could
not laugh at him. He spoke as though he had thrown away tens of
thousands on the turf and on racing studs, and as though his
conquest among the fair sex had been legion. And in his opinion
there was no doubt they had. He was undersized, sandy, and
slightly bow-legged; but, like his dog, he looked all fight.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards I had to drive in to the neighboring
township. As there was a good camp halfway we were in the habit
of making two days of the journey, although it could actually be
done in one. Arrived at the halfway camp on Native Creek, I saw
that there was already a traveller camped there, who I found to
be the man with the damaged ear who had left the station the
morning before. The place had suited him to spell for a day as
the feed was very good.</p>

<p>I was not sorry for the company, as the man promised to be
more interesting than the ordinary station hand. He bustled about
helping to unharness and hobble my horses, and his dog, moved by
remembrance of the New England tongue, came up wagging his stumpy
tail, and we renewed our acquaintance. I had a little whisky with
me, and when our meal was finished, our beds made down, and the
continuous tinkle of the horse bells told that those animals were
enjoying themselves, I produced it.</p>

<p>'I saw you looking at my ear the other day,' said my
companion, after a snort silence. You couldn't guess how I lost
that bit of my anatomy.'</p>

<p>'No; guessing's too much trouble. You may as well tell me if
you're not sleepy.'</p>

<p>'Well it was served the same as these ears of Paddy's have
been,' he replied, fondling the dog; 'that piece was bitten out
of my ear, but not by dog. By another man, or a thing in the
shape of a man, wuss nor a dog. He was a Dago at sea, a low-down
sort of South American, and some day I'll come across him again,
and I'll pay a debt I owe him. It happened way down on the Maroo.
Perhaps you know that part of the country?'</p>

<p>I said that I did.</p>

<p>'Then you know the Big Duck Bend. There was pub there, and at
that time they was doing well. The bloke who kept it had his
niece up there&mdash;a real pretty girl, and smart too, my word!
She would play the pianner, and sing, too, and every mother's son
was clean gone dotty about her. I had a good cheque, for I had
been a long trip overlanding, and I sailed in and cut out the
running, you bet your boots! And things was very nice and jolly
for a bit. Now, there was this South American brute on the
company's station, seven miles away, and he was always over there
philandering about. He was a big, hulking brute of a fellow, with
the wickedest black eyes you ever saw, and every gal he came
across&mdash;O! he was her slave, for her to do what she liked
with, and all that ladidah game takes with the women, you know.
He had been carrying on with Josey Dean before I came, and
playing first fiddle, so when I waded in and took the lead he
began to get ugly. I believe he was a good hand with cattle, but
that I know nothing of for I never saw him working; but he was no
favorite about there&mdash;used to put on too many airs.</p>

<p>'The row commenced over Paddy here; we'd been kicking gravel
for some time; but one day I was in the bar with a couple of
bullockies who had stopped there for a drink. Up rode my noble
Dago, as big as bull beef, with a red sash round his waist, like
the nigger he was, and his hat on one side. He tied his horse up
and came in. Paddy here, who hated him as bad as I did, gave a
low growl, so as he passed the dog he muttered something In his
own lingo, and gave Paddy a thundering kick in the ribs. Paddy
jumped up with a bit of a howl, and fastened on him like grim
death; my noble don yells out "blue murder;" the bullockie's dogs
come tumbling in, and there was a right old noise. I called Paddy
off, and says I to the Dago, who was as white as a sheet, "No man
kicks my dog when the dog's done nothing," I says, so take that,
you d&mdash;&mdash;d blackfellow,' and I hits him with my open
hand across the face.</p>

<p>'He turned black at once, and his hand flew to his belt; but
Sailor Bob, one of the bullockies, who knew the breed, got hold
of his hand and had the knife out of it in no time. Well, he
warnt one for fighting with his fists, but he had to, and at it
we went. Says Sailor Bob to me: "Don't you let him get a holt on
you, Dick," which was mighty good advice, but, fighting there in
the bar, I couldn't get away from him always, and at last he did
get a hold of me, and got me down, being, as he was, so much
bigger than me. What d'ye think the brute did when he had me
down? Why, commenced worrying me with his teeth like a beast, and
before the others could drag him off he'd bitten this piece out
of my ear. And he must have swallowed it, too, as it was never
found. The bullock drivers was furious. They wanted to tie him up
and take turns at him with their bullock whips. But no, I says,
it's my contract, and I'll finish it outside. So we went outside,
and I takes good care as he never gets a hold of me again. I
pasted him till his head was big enough for two, for he couldn't
use his dooks a little bit, and then he lays flown and cries and
refuses to get up again. "Get up, you thundering cannibal, and
have some more," I says, and kicks his ribs like he kicked Paddy,
but he wouldn't stir. Just then I felt myself pulled back, and
there stood Josey, out of breath. She'd been away somewhere, and
hadn't seen the fight, but came up just in time to see me kick
the man when he was on the ground, and file other fellows a
looking on and saying nothing.</p>

<p>'Lord, didn't she let out. Of course, like a woman, she didn't
want to know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the business, but
just went Into the game off her own bat, and, by Jove, she did
score. She put her hands on her hips, and tongue-lashed us one
after another, calling us all the cowards she could lay her
tongue to. As for Mister Dago, when he found that he had a
woman's petticoat to get behind, he mighty soon got up, and stood
behind it for safety. When she had slanged us to a standstill, we
went inside and had a drink, and bandaged my ear up. Now, of
course, I knew very well that it was just a woman's way to take
the part of the one who was down, and if it had been me on the
ground she'd have fired up just the same, so I concluded I would
make it up with her in a day or two, and after she'd heard the
rights of the story she would not speak to Mister Dago.</p>

<p>'She nursed him all the afternoon, and when it was dark he
rode home. She wouldn't speak or listen to me, and I got sulky.
The Dago had a bad time of it, you may guess. The bullockies
didn't spare him when they told the yarn, and he get put in
Coventry by everybody. They used to hoot him and cry "Cannibal!"
everywhere, and even put up the black gins to scream out to their
picanninies to run when they saw him coming. Of course, this
couldn't go on, and the boss of the company's station had to tell
him to clear out, and he went.</p>

<p>'But he didn't go alone, curse him. Josey disappeared too.
Somehow I often think that if I'd not been foolish, but humored
the girl, it would have been all right, but I cut up rough and
sulked. And perhaps I was partly to blame.'</p>

<p>The unconscious good faith in which this was said, and the
profound belief in the results of his influence, if it had been
exerted, was too genuine to excite ridicule. He remained silent
for a bit, staring Into the fire. I took up his pannikin and
replenished it and my own.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, after he had swallowed his nip, 'I saw poor
Josey once afterwards, and I'd sooner have seen her dead. It was
two years after she ran away, and I was down in Sydney. One
night. I passed three girls, and one of them was Josey, painted
and dressed as you can imagine. But I went after her, and got her
to speak to me.</p>

<p>'She told me that Pedro, as she called him, had shipped aboard
a ship for Rio, and left her to starve, or earn her living the
way she was doing. She vowed she'd stick a knife into him if ever
he came back. She always had a temper; but now the life and the
drink had made it awful.</p>

<p>'I could do her no good, and she wouldn't let me help her,
whether or no, but as I walked home I thought what an awful brute
the fellow had been. If a woman had stood up for me when I was
down the way Josey did for him, there's nothing I wouldn't have
done for her; while he, the low cur, had shown his gratitude by
ruining her. I put my hand up to my ear and felt the place, and
vowed that if I came across him again I would put a mark on him,
both for Josey's sake and my own.'</p>

<p>The horse bells had ceased; they were camping. The fire had
burned down to red embers, and Orion's Belt was straight
overhead.</p>

<p>'That's the end?' I asked.</p>

<p>'So far it is,' he answered; 'but I hope it is not the
end.'</p>

<p>We said good night, and rolled ourselves in our blankets. In
the morning I told Dick Martin, as I learnt his name was, that in
a couple of months we should be busy, and if he was about
anywhere, and in want of a job, I could put him on then.</p>

<p>Sure enough he turned up, and, as things eventuated remained
with us for over twelve months. He was a good hand, and I grew
very fond of Paddy, who quickly fought himself up top dog on the
station. One day Dick came to me and said that if I could manage
to spare him he would like to leave shortly.</p>

<p>'Leave altogether, Dick?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Not altogether, Mr. Duncan, if things turn out right, but if
they go wrong, I may not be able to come back.'</p>

<p>'Where are you going, then?'</p>

<p>'To finish up that old story, sir. One of the teamsters who
passed here the other day was Sailor Bob, and he told me that
Pedro was back, and that he saw him up the Burdekin way, on a
station there. I'll go and see for myself.'</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to let Dick go, although, as a
J.P., I ought to have bound him over to keep the peace before
leaving, but I did not suppose it would be much good, and he
departed about a fortnight after he had spoken to me.</p>

<p>Months passed, and though I had scanned the newspapers
curiously, I saw no report of any tragedy, when one day Dick
turned up, without Paddy. Needless to say, my curiosity was
great, particularly when I saw Dick had been scarred on the other
ear, and, under some excuse, I managed to get him by himself, and
he told me what had happened.</p>

<p>'When I left here I went north, and, sure enough, I began to
hear of my man when I got near the Burdekin district; but when I
reached the station where Bob saw him he had left. Well, I
followed him, right out to the Flinders, and there I lost track
of him. At last I was coming back licked, when, riding late to
make a lagoon where I wanted to camp, I saw a fire in the scrub
surrounding it. I could hear a horse-bell, so I knew it was not
blacks. I rode towards it, when suddenly Paddy gave an angry
bark, and rushed ahead. It flashed across me who it was, and I
hurried after, but was too late. Pedro, aroused by the bark, was
prepared, and when Paddy rushed at him he knocked him senseless
and dying with a heavy bit of brigalow from the fire. I was so
mad with rage that, instead of bailing him up with my revolver, I
jumped off, and tackled him barehanded. I got the worst of it.
and down we went, I underneath. He snarled some curses, of his
own, and then I felt his teeth in my other uninjured ear. He bit
pretty hard, but suddenly he let go, and toppled over with a
yell, as something hairy dragged across my face. Poor dying
Paddy, with a last struggle he had staggered across me, and fixed
his teeth in Pedro's throat.</p>

<p>'It was a last effort, but it saved me. I sprang up, and
before the Dago could get rid of the dead dog, I had tapped him
on the head with the same bit of timber he had downed Paddy with.
When he came to his senses he was tied up, and all his cutlery
taken away. I made the fire up bright, then went and caught my
horses, which Bad strolled off to feed; next took Paddy's body
into the scrub, and then came back to my friend. I told him that
I had seen Josey, and that I had a score to pay off on her
account, as well as my own, and took my pocket knife out of my
pouch. Lord! He made sure I was going to cut his throat, and sang
out pen and ink, I told him that he was a beast, and I was going
to ear-mark him like one, and I did.'</p>

<p>Martin paused, and then went on.</p>

<p>'I put the swallow tail on him, and then I let him free and
rode away. He's marked for life, you bet.'</p>

<p>For the information of some readers, I may as well state that
the 'swallow-tail' ear mark is an acute-angled triangular piece
cut out of the ear; the ear stands up in two sharp points after
the operation. It would be a terrible disfigurement to a man,
worse than close cropping.</p>

<p>'Have you heard nothing more? Did he not go in and inform the
police?'</p>

<p>'Not he, he had no witnesses to prove it was me.'</p>

<p>'Strikes me the end of the story is yet to come. I would be
careful if I were you, Dick. No half breed could stand that
treatment without seeking revenge.'</p>

<p>'Let him try it, sir. But I wish Paddy had not been
killed.'</p>

<p>'So do I. He was a good friend to you.'</p>

<p>Dick came back to his billet and things went on in the usual
routine for some months. We were then forming a new weaning
station, and Dick with another man went out to live at a hut we
had put up there, and looked after the weaners. They had been
there about two months when Dick's companion was attacked by
malarial fever, and came up to the head station to spell, Martin
sending word that he would put in the week by himself and not
want a fresh man sent down.</p>

<p>I called at the hut during the week and found everything
quiet. Just as I was leaving Dick said, 'I wish old Paddy was
alive, and with me. I dreamt of the old beggar last night.'</p>

<p>Somehow, although the expression was an ordinary one, it
remained in my memory and, to a certain extent, haunted me. At
the end of the week a man went down with rations, but did not see
Dick, who was apparently away about his work. Then a few days'
rain came, and Martin's companion, who was well again, went down,
and returned that night with the news that the hut had evidently
been unvisited since the man went down with the rations.</p>

<p>We searched high and low, but the rain had put out the tracks,
and though we found Dick's horse, with the saddle and bridle on,
we did not find Dick.</p>

<p>Fully six months afterwards two bodies were found in a small,
scrubby range. One was Martin's&mdash;that we knew, by many
signs. The other&mdash;well, the skin had dried mummy-like on the
body, and the shrunken withered features still survived, like
parched leather.</p>

<p>'Good God!' exclaimed my partner, 'what's the matter with the
man's ears?'</p>

<p>I looked, and shuddered at the grotesque mockery of death the
mutilated members made the body wear.</p>

<p>'He's swallow-tail ear-marked on both ears; what can be the
meaning of it?'</p>

<p>I could have told him, but held my peace. It was dead Martin's
secret, not mine.</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF THE OVERLAND LINE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 20 Feb 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'I WILL take my oath on it, he returned the sign most
distinctly and correctly.'</p>

<p>'I think you're wrong, old man. Niggers always imitate you If
you do anything.'</p>

<p>'I'm convinced that I'm not mistaken, and I intend, to follow
it up.'</p>

<p>The dispute took place on one of the overland telegraph
stations well in the centre of Australia, and the friendly,
disputants were the stationmaster and a man from the south, up
looking for country. It was in the early years of the line, and
travellers were rare, and made very welcome. The subject was an
incident that had occurred when Merven, the squatting man, had
been out on a short, three days' trip. He had met with some
natives, and he declared that an old man amongst them had made
him a Masonic sign, which, he answered, and that the native had
then made the correct following one, which he had replied to,
when one of the party riding hastily up scared the blacks, who
got away in the scrub, and they could not communicate with them
again. Merven refused to listen to Mathers's explanation that it
was all accidental, and was determined to go back and try and
track the niggers up.</p>

<p>In a day or two he started with one white man and a
blackfellow, a good tracker. Days passed, and ran into a
fortnight, and then the blackfellow came back alone, with a
rudely scrawled note. It was from the man who had accompanied
Merven. He stated that Merven and he had found the natives camped
at the water, where the note was written from. That Merven had
interchanged many signs with an old white-haired man of the
party, who seemed to understand him pretty well. That Merven
finally went away with the natives, saying that he would be back
in less than a week, and telling him to wait at the water for a
week if he could make the rations last out.</p>

<p>That he had waited past the week a good bit, and his rations
were almost finished, and he wanted Mathers to send him out word
what he had better do. Masters thought the matter out, and
decided to go back with the black boy, which he did, taking a
good supply of rations. There had been no sign of Merven when he
reached the camp, and he found the man rather hungrily awaiting
the return of the black boy. They discussed the matter during the
night, and Mathers concluded that, as a fortnight had elapsed,
they had better, start and track the party up in the morning. The
weather was fine, and he had a good assistant at the station, so
he could afford to be away.</p>

<p>In the morning they made an early start, and did a very good
day's work, as the blacks made a straight course for a distant
hill of some height, in the McDonnell Ranges. Next day it was the
same, and in the evening they reached a rocky ridge not far from
the hill. Here the camp of the blacks had been occupied for some
days, and here, to Mathers's horror, they found the skeleton of
Merven's horse, which had evidently been killed and eaten, as the
numerous ovens testified. The two men passed an uncomfortable
night, doleful anticipations as to Merven's fate being uppermost
in their minds.</p>

<p>In the morning they renewed their search, but without avail;
they could not find which way the tracks' went, search high or
low. They went over to the prominent hill, but found no traces of
human presence about it and from the top could see nothing but
rugged ranges to the north. After spending two days in vain
efforts to pick up the tracks; the were forced to return; Merven
had vanished from human ken.</p>

<p><br>
IT was six months after this episode, another party had gone
out with a like result, and Merven's disappearance had become
past history, when one night there was a furious outcry of dogs,
and the lost man stepped onto the verandah out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>Mathers and his assistant were too startled to speak, almost
doubting if the newcomer were real flesh and blood. He was thin
and haggard, but his clothes were not much worse for wear, and he
laughed at their consternation and asked for something to
eat.</p>

<p>'Where the deuce have you been all this time, and what
happened to you?' demanded Mathers.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'll tell you when I've had a decent feed and a wash.
Just now I'm tired and famished.' He looked around with a
half-frightened look as he spoke, and followed Mathers into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>'How did you get back?' the latter asked. 'Did you walk? We
saw where they killed your horse.'</p>

<p>'Did they kill my horse?' asked Merven indifferently</p>

<p>'Yes, didn't you know it?'</p>

<p>'No; but I'm tired.'</p>

<p>Mathers saw the futility of asking any more questions just
then, and they returned to the living room; where a meal had now
been laid for the wanderer. Merven sat down, and commenced to
eat; Mathers went to the instrument. He had scarcely touched the
key before Merven called to him.</p>

<p>'Don't wire news of my coming back yet. Wait till to-morrow,
will you?'</p>

<p>'Just as you like.'</p>

<p>'I'll tell you all about it to-morrow. They might call me
to-night, don't you see?'</p>

<p>'No; I'm hanged if I see. And who are "they"?'</p>

<p>'Never mind, I'm talking a bit at random. I'll explain in the
morning.'</p>

<p>Mathers got up from the instrument, feeling rather puzzled,
and as Merven appeared very sleepy after his meal he didn't
plague him with any questions.</p>

<p>'Would you mind keeping your peg out tonight?' said Merven, as
Mathers was about to cut off communication before going to
bed.</p>

<p>'Why? Do you expect a message?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I suppose the call would always wake you?'</p>

<p>'Yes; both Jimmy and I if we were dead.'</p>

<p>'I might get a message,' repeated Merven in a curious tone, as
he lay down on his improvised bed, and seemed to go off to sleep
at once.</p>

<p>'Blessed if I can understand it. He's gone daft in the bush;
but I'll get it all explained in the morning. Good night, Jimmy;
get up if we are called.'</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, or rather, morning, Mathers sprang
out of bed half asleep, awakened by the sharp repetitions of his
station call. At the table he blundered against Jimmy, who was
just replying.</p>

<p>'Whose calling?' said Mathers, as he lit a candle.</p>

<p>'Hanged if I know. Here he is again. "Is George Merven
there?"' he read out aloud.</p>

<p>'Yes; who's speaking?' ticked Jimmy.</p>

<p>'Come back, come back at once; he is moving,' was the answer,
though whom it came from it did not say.'</p>

<p>'What? what?' said a voice behind them. It was Merven, dressed
as he had thrown himself down. The two men repeated what they had
just read out.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes! I must go back,' he said, making for the door.</p>

<p>Before they thought of stopping them he opened it and passed
out. Recovering from their surprise, both men went after him. It
was a brilliant, moonlight night, light as day on the cleared
ground round the station; inky black in the distant patches of
mulga scrub. But not a sign of the man who had just left was
visible, although he had but a few seconds' start. Not a dog
stirred, not a footstep could be heard. Over all was absolute
stillness, unbroken silence.</p>

<p>'Have we been dreaming?' asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>They went Inside, and asked the repeating stations north and
south if they had been speaking to them; but both denied it. The
cablegrams had mostly gone through, and the line had been
perfectly quiet for over an hour.</p>

<p>Mathers jammed the peg in viciously.</p>

<p>'We'll have no more calls to-night, at any rate,' he said</p>

<p>In the morning they hunted vainly for tracks. The mystery of
Merven's disappearance had now a touch of the supernatural about
it. How could the sender of the mysterious message have called
the one station without being heard elsewhere was a question
no-one could fathom.</p>

<p>'Was it Merven came here?' asked Jimmy, when they had
exhausted all conjectures.</p>

<p>'It was, and it was not. He seemed stupid, as though he had
been wandering alone by himself, and yet his clothes looked
nearly as well as when he left; and I swear he had not walked in
from where we saw his last camp. I give it up.'</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
SOME six months elapsed of dull, uneventful life, when one
morning a blackfellow came up to the station, one belonging to
the tribe living about the place. He explained that there was a
whitefellow out in the bush too weak to walk. A party was sent
out at once, taking food and water, and about fifteen miles away
the black led them to a man lying exhausted under a bough shade
the friendly blacks had made for him. Naked, a mere skeleton of
skin and bone, with scratches and cuts all over his body, lay
George Merven; and as Mathers knelt beside him he somehow felt
that this was not the same man as the strange being who visited
the station some two months before:</p>

<p>Merven was too weak to speak, but looked at his friend with
eyes of recognition&mdash;recognition that, Mathers remembered
with a shudder, had been absent from the other man. They would
not let him speak; but fed him skilfully with strengthening food,
and in two or three days were able to take him in to the station.
At last he was strong enough to tell his story; but first he
answered the question Mathers had been longing to ask.</p>

<p>No; he had not come to the station two months ago.</p>

<p>'When I found the blacks,' he said, 'I discovered that the old
man was fairly well up in Masonry, apparently of an ancient
order; but he was a true Mason. He gave me to understand that the
masters lived in the range, and that if I liked he would take me
to them. To this I agreed, and went with them, as you know, to
the ridge near a high hill on the outskirts of the McDonnell
Range. Here there was good feed and water, and I left my horse
and went with the old fellow to the hill on foot, as I understood
from him the masters were to be found there.</p>

<p>'The hill, when reached, proved to be a high, granite one,
precipitous on the northern side.'</p>

<p>'I have been there,' interrupted Mathers.</p>

<p>'On the precipitous side is a small cave which you would not
see, as a tree grows in front, and hides it. Into this the old
fellow conducted me, and holding my hand led me down a dark
tunnel. How far we went stumbling along in the dark I know not,
but at last our way seemed blocked, and we halted. In response,
I suppose, to some signal from my guide, a door, seemed to be
opened, and there was a dim light, in which stood a dark figure.
We entered; the light instantly got bright, and I was able to see
our new acquaintance. He was dark, but not black, and, to my
astonishment, wore a long garment. His face had a Hebrew cast,
and he had a full black beard. He looked at me with a pleased
expression, and led the way on. It was now quite light, although
I could not see where the light came from, and the rocky passage
was wider and more easy of progress. We came at last to a
fair-sized room or cavern with stone benches in it, and on these
our guide motioned to us to sit while he went away. He soon
returned with another man dressed like him. He approached me, and
made some Masonic signs, which I answered, but I soon found that
he was of a grade far above me, and I had to desist. He asked me
by signs if I was tired, and offered me some drink in a wooden
mug. I drank it, and immediately felt a feeling of intense
sleepiness not to be resisted, and I lay down on the stone bench,
and lost consciousness.</p>

<p>'When I came to myself the light was dim, but brightened when
I moved, as though someone was watching me. I looked around; the
old native had disappeared, but two men now approached me. One,
the man, who had given me the drink; the other a dark man of
Jewish look like his companion, but possessing a wonderfully
benign and beautiful face. He smiled at me, and invited me to
rise. I cannot tell you, of the many conversations I had with
that marvellous creature, that Incarnation of all evil, but I
learned from him that Freemasonry, as we term it, is but an
offshoot of a mighty religion that once held the then civilised,
parts of the world in sway. But while the doctrines now held, or
professedly held, by Masons, are those of brotherly love and
kindness, the tenets of the ancient religion were evil in
everything. I was their prisoner, for a purpose, which I will
tell you:</p>

<p>'They wanted my body.'</p>

<p>'Say no more, now,' said Mathers, 'you are tiring yourself
out.'</p>

<p>Merven obeyed and dropped into a doze.</p>

<p>'What's all this thundering trash?' said Jim. 'He has been
wandering about sun-struck, I am afraid, and imagined it
all.'</p>

<p>Just then the station was called. Mathers went to the key</p>

<p>'Is George Merven there?'</p>

<p>'Who is it speaking?' was ticked out.</p>

<p>'Is George Merven there?'</p>

<p>'Who is it speaking?' persisted Mathers.</p>

<p>'I have a message for him.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?'</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>'Some of the fellows are having a lark, said Jimmy; 'Why
didn't you take their message?'</p>

<p>'No, in any case we will not. I have a reason.'</p>

<p>Merven slept on, and was able to take more food when he awoke.
He then persisted in going on with his narrative, but the
stationmaster said nothing of the mysterious message, thinking it
better not to agitate him.</p>

<p><br>
'THESE wretches are all over the world, and in constant
communication with one another. The particular ones I was with
came from Mexico across the Pacific, after the conquest. They
found the natives totally unfitted for their purpose, and beyond
teaching a few of them a little of the craft, they did nothing
but prepare this secret place in the ranges. They have many
scientific and other secrets that we do not possess, particularly
the possession of a new force akin to electricity, by which they
can travel through the air at an enormous rate.</p>

<p>'They are very active all over the world by means of these
secrets; nearly all the unaccountable crimes that happen are
inspired by them. I was well treated the first month of my
captivity, but after that I received the most inhuman treatment,
in consequence, of my stubborn refusal to fall in with their
views. Without my consent they could not make use of my body,
except by sending me in a stupor, which did not last long enough
for their purpose, and which might terminate at any time by my
awakening.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean by making use of your body, and mating it with
another spirit while you were unconscious?'</p>

<p>'Yes; to work their own ends in the world. As yet they have
remained quiescent in Australia to a great extent, waiting till
the country is more settled. I was the first white man to be
brought under their sway. How many months have I been lost?'</p>

<p>'About eight.'</p>

<p>'Most of that time they have been torturing me, to make me
fall in with their views&mdash;latterly it was starvation. The
old black who lured me there used to come and give me scraps of
food, otherwise I was kept in total darkness and solitude. We
could converse a little, and I found out that some great event
was anticipated the end of this century, and that most of the
inhabitants of my place of imprisonment were away working in
other countries. I believe the old fellow was moved by my
emaciated appearance. After that attempt to use my body, while I
was drugged, which probably was when that creature came here, I
was left a good deal to the care of that blackfellow, who took a
sudden fit of compassion on me, and aided me to escape. Darkness
was one of the methods used for punishing me, the old blackfellow
having been entrusted with the power of manipulating the light
when he came to me. Under coyer of this darkness he allowed me to
follow him out, but hardly had we reached open air before my
escape must have been discovered. What power they had over that
wretched black I know not, but we had not taken many steps before
he was scorched up as if by lightning before my eyes. I was
untouched, and they, did not seem able to reach me by the agency
which had destroyed my companion! How I wandered here I know not,
always feeling that I was being watched and pursued. At last I
met with the friendly blacks, and sent a message in by one when I
could ho longer move.'</p>

<p>For some days Merven lingered between life and death, but at
last recovered sufficiently to go down south with safety. He went
under medical treatment, and Mathers heard that he got better.
The two men on the station reported the return of Merven, but
nothing else, for they did not know what to believe after their
own experience. Time passed on, and Mathers was anticipating a
shift, when late one evening the station was called, and; once
more the familiar question was asked relative to George Mervin.
This time he took the message out of curiosity. It simply
was&mdash;</p>

<p>'Tell him we are waiting.'</p>

<p>A week afterwards Merven himself appeared, looking as well as
ever. To Mathers's astonishment he announced his intention of
going out to the hill again with a man he had with him, and
finding out if there was any truth in the delusions he had
entertained. Now, with his recovered health, he thought he had
been the victim of temporary madness, and had been with the
blacks all the time, or wandering about the bush. Mathers told
him of the message he had received.</p>

<p>'It's a trick someone is playing on you,' he said. 'They are
tapping the line somewhere.'</p>

<p>When he persisted in going on, Mathers asked to go with him,
and they started. They went over the remembered ground until they
reached: the camp where the horse had been killed. The next
morning they went to the hill.</p>

<p>The weather, was close, hot, and heavy clouds hung low; even
in the morning there was a constant mutter of thunder. Merven led
them round to the northern side of the hill. They left their
horses at the foot of the rough country, and climbed up to the
place where Merven said the pave entrance was.. He pointed out
the tree, or what he thought was the tree, and climbed up before
them to it. He looked behind, and shouted down, 'It's all humbug,
there's no cave here.'</p>

<p>The clouds had been hanging lower and lower while they had
been ascending, until the bottom of the black scud seemed to
touch the top of the hill. As Merven spoke there was a blinding
flash and a terrific peal of thunder. When the two men looked up
Merven was gone.</p>

<p>They searched and waited in vain. No trace of him, nor sign of
entrance could be found. Meantime, the most awful thunderstorm
they had either of them ever experienced burst overhead The day
was dark as evening; there was little or no rain, but the
lightning and thunder were incessant.</p>

<p>'Let's get off this hill,' shouted Mathers in his companion's
ear, 'I believe it attracts the lightning.'</p>

<p>They made their way back to where they had left their horses,
blinded and deafened, and expecting to be struck down any moment.
In an hour the storm had died away, growling and muttering, and
they resumed their search without avail. They were at last forced
to return to the camp unsuccessful, and finally go back to the
line.</p>

<p>'Merven got ahead of you,' said Jimmy as they dismounted.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked Mathers.</p>

<p>'He turned up here late yesterday evening said he came ahead
to send an important telegram. He went back this morning to meet
you; started before I was up.'</p>

<p>Mathers looked hard at his assistant.</p>

<p>'Are you quite sure it was Merven?' he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy started and muttered, 'I don't believe it.'</p>

<p>The two went in together, and Mathers reported disappearance
of Merven again, and intimated that a search party would be of no
avail.</p>

<p>What was the telegram that thing sent?' he asked.</p>

<p>'It was in cipher: I could make nothing of it.'</p>

<p>'Did you see his horse?'</p>

<p>'No, it was dark when he came in, and he left before anyone
was up.'</p>

<p>'It's all a trick of some sort,' said Mathers, 'I'm certain of
it; but anyhow, somebody else can have the benefit of it, I
shan't come back here...'</p>

<p>It was twelve months after that the station has to be shifted
on account of the many times it was struck by lightning and the
instrument destroyed. Geologically, there was no accounting for
it, but the authorities decided there must be a reef of iron In
the neighborhood, and the site was moved.</p>

<p>Tales, however, were told that they could not get operators to
stop on account of the constant calls that took place&mdash;calls
that when answered only, brought back broken and unintelligible
appeals for help from someone who would give no name.</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>25. &mdash; THE HALF-CASTES OF MOUNT DOUBLETOP</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 4 and 11 June 1898</h3>

<h3>PART 1</h3>

<p>A LONG time ago, when there were not many wire fences about
and thirty miles, or so between stations was the ordinary
distance, there was a solitary hut, a tailing yard, and a little
horse yard standing on the bank of a river in Northern
Queensland. It was not always inhabited, being only an adjunct to
the head station, fifteen miles away; but at times, when there
were some weaners to herd, a couple of men put in a lonely
existence for three months at a time. It was not near any road,
and the bridle track to the station was the only means of
communication with the outer world. It was well up the river, and
a few miles brought you to the spurs of the coast range, from the
top of which, on clear days, you could see the stretch of flat
coast country that intervened between the foot of the range and
the sea. But it was a rough ascent and descent, and only out of
curiosity had any one ever been there. The hut at this time was
occupied, and had been for nearly two months. The weaners were
now broken in steady and quiet, and the men then there had not
much to do to kill the deadly monotony of the passing days.</p>

<p>It was near the close of the day when one of the men, as
usual, rode home to make up the fire, bring up water, and perform
the other slight hutkeeping duties which they took alternately.
He hung his horse up, to assist his mate to yard the tailers
presently, and went about his work. After making up the fire he
took the two buckets and went down the bank of the river; there
was a strip of sand to cross, and as he went to the water he
suddenly stopped with a whistle of surprise; there was a regular
pad of blacks tracks crossing the sand in a diagonal direction.
He put down the buckets, and glanced keenly and suspiciously
around, at the same time unbuttoning the flap of his revolver
pouch. There was nothing, stirring, and not a sound to be heard;
so, after a few moments of hesitation, he went warily on, filled
his buckets and returned. The lead of that home-returning herd
were just approaching the yard as he put the buckets down in the
verandah. He shut the hut door, mounted his horse, and rode out
to his mate.</p>

<p>At that time the blacks in that part of Australia had not been
what is called 'let in.' That is, they kept back from the
occupied country, and if they approached an inhabited place it
was generally from a hostile intention. The two men discussed the
matter of the tracks as they yarded the cattle, and, when the
sliprails were put up, they went and examined the tracks and
followed them some distance.</p>

<p>'They are all bucks' tracks, and going straight ahead,' said
Nicholls, the man who had first seen them.</p>

<p>'They don't seem to want to interfere with us,' replied his
mate; 'but they've got some object in view, by the way they are
travelling.'</p>

<p>'The horses are just back of the scrub,' said Nicholls. 'One
of us had better take a fresh one and go in and tell them at the
station.'</p>

<p>'What the blazes made them cross the river just at our hut?
Blamed queer thing for them to do; if they'd have kept the other
side we should have seen nothing of the tracks,' returned Reddy,
the second man.</p>

<p>'Don't understand it at all; but I'll run the horses in while
you get grub ready. There's a good moon to-night.'</p>

<p>An hour afterwards Nicholls was on the track, to the station,
keeping a watchful eye about him. But the lonely bridle pad was
as lonely as usual. At times he would hear the wail of the
curlews, or a startled owl would flutter out of a low tree, but
there was no sign of the natives. No glow of fire, nor echoing
chant of a corroboree.</p>

<p>He reached the head station at about 11 o'clock, and of course
had to arouse them from their first sleep, for early hours are
kept in the outside country. The boss came to the conclusion that
a little cattle-killing was in the wind, but nobody could
understand why they should have walked so defiantly, as it were,
past the outside hut, knowing that their tracks would be seen
when the men came back. And it was strange that they had not
looted the hut when they passed.</p>

<p>By sunrise Nicholls, with the superintendent and another white
man and a blackboy, were back at the outstation, just as Reddy
was letting the rails down to let the cattle out. The night had
passed quietly, as usual, and the mystery as to what the blacks
intended to do was still unsolved.</p>

<p>After breakfast the man from the station remained to look
after the weaners, and the superintendent, Reddy, Nicholls, and
the blackboy started on the trail. It was easy enough to follow.
There was nor straggling. The tracks kept on close together,
bearing from the river towards an outlying spur of the coast
range that divided the river the station was on from another
small tributary of the main stream. They followed on for some
hours. The tracks crossed the station track, but the party had
not seen them in the semi-dark, and when it was nearly noon a
two-peaked hill appeared in sight, and towards it the trail would
appear to be steadily leading. There was a little water in a
small creek, and the party stopped for a hasty meal.</p>

<p>'They must have passed your hut pretty early,' said Rolleston,
the manager. 'There's no sign at a camp yet, and they have not
been hunting as they went. They don't seem to mean any mischief
either to us or the cattle, so we won't make any trouble if we
overtake them; but I should like to see what they are up to.'</p>

<p>'It's the queerest start I ever saw, and I thought I knew
something about niggers,' said Reddy.</p>

<p>'There's not a hoof runs up this way, and they must know
that,' put in Nicholls; 'so it's not beef they're after.'</p>

<p>In an hour or two the two-peaked hill was fully in sight, and
the tracks still kept straight on. The hill was known by sight to
them, and was locally called Mount Doubletop, but nobody had yet
been there. It was nearly 3 o'clock, and the base of the hill was
nearly in sight, when a waft of wind came from the direction in
which they were going, and simultaneously they pulled up, for to
their practises senses it carried in its breath the unmistakable
smell of a blacks' camp ahead. It was evident they were close to
their quarry, and caution was necessary, for the party they were
following was a large one, and all males, so that it would not do
to blunder on top of them unprepared.</p>

<p>'If the beggars are on that hill they can see us as we come,'
said Nicholls to the manager, Rolleston. 'What do you say to
following the bed of that little creek? It seems to come down
from Doubletop.'</p>

<p>After a little discussion it was determined to do so, as it
would afford a little shelter to their approach.</p>

<p>'It's my opinion,' said Reddy, 'that they don't give a hang
whether we see them or not, or else why would they have come past
the hut, when they could have gone miles away just as easy?'</p>

<p>This very pertinent question could not be answered, and the
party kept on along the little creek. It was not long before they
heard the cry of a native ahead of them, seemingly about halfway
up the hill, and they halted to listen.</p>

<p>The cry was answered higher up, and again answered apparently
from the summit.</p>

<p>'What does that mean?' said Rolleston. 'Have they seen
us?'</p>

<p>'They guess we're about,' said Reddy, who seemed to have an
unalterable conviction that the natives rather desired their
company than not. 'Seems to me they'd know jolly well that we'd
follow their tracks; and that's a sort of invite.'</p>

<p>Rolleston got off his horse and went up the bank, whence he
could get a clearer view of the hill. Nicholls followed him. They
reconnoitred the hill, and saw a blackfellow standing erect on a
prominent rock a short distance up the hill. As they looked he
repeated the cry they had heard; again it was answered higher up,
and another black was visible standing prominently out on the
rock. Again came the cry, and there was a third one standing on
the highest peak of the two that crowned Doubletop.</p>

<p>'By Jingo! Reddy's right, and they are calling to us to come
on,' said Nicholls.</p>

<p>'It looks like it,' answered Rolleston. 'I suppose we'll have
to go, for we mustn't turn back.'</p>

<p>Reddy had joined them, and after a few words the whole party
left the cover of the creek and rode straight to the hill. As
they emerged in a thinly timbered strip of country that formed
the commencement of the hill, it became evident that the cries
had really been addressed to them, for the blacks waved their
hands and kept up their cries.</p>

<p>It was rather a puzzle how to proceed. The natives might be
only crying out in defiance, as they generally did if they
thought themselves in safety; or they might be issuing a general
invitation to come up and be killed. It was hard to determine. If
they went on foot one of them would have to stop to mind the
horses, and the chances are he might get attacked and the horses
clear out. The hill was not too steep to negotiate on horseback,
and there was a good leading spur on one side that promised an
easy ascent, so to that they made. The blacks became silent when
they saw the whites turn off, but seemed satisfied when they saw
them continue, to come on along the crown of the spur. There was
no sign of running away amongst them, for now a good many more
were visible. Nor did they exhibit any arms; but this might have
been a trick, as they have a knack of dragging them with their
toes. They stood, their ground until the whites reached a sort of
plateau on the summit, from which arose the two rocky peaks that
distinguished the hill.</p>

<p>Rolleston glanced around somewhat uneasily. It was not exactly
a nice place to be trapped in, but still they were well armed,
and tried men, and ought to stand a good chance if they kept
their eyes well open. With a word of caution to keep their eyes
in the backs of their heads, he rode a little ahead.</p>

<p>The natives, in their usual noiseless fashion, had gathered in
a group in front of an overhanging shelf or rock that formed a
sort of cave. Fires were burning all about, and there were a few
throwing-sticks lying about, but no signs of other weapons. The
blacks were about twenty in number, all grown men, and painted
with white pigment, skeleton fashion. Some old white-beards were
amongst them, and one of these advanced a few steps to meet
Rolleston.</p>

<p>He held up his empty hands as a sign of peace, to which the
white man replied in the same manner. The black then commenced a
speech, which was, of course, quite unintelligible to Rolleston,
and was accompanied with many gestures, particularly pointing
towards the direction of the head station, and shaking his head
and waving his hand, as if to express a negative. Rolleston
signed to his blackboy to come up, but he, being a South
Queensland boy, could not understand.</p>

<p>'He wants to make out that they do not mean anything against
the cattle or station,' volunteered Reddy, who had been watching
intently. 'Blessed if I don't believe that's why they passed the
hut so close, just to show that they didn't mean any harm.'</p>

<p>Rolleston agreed with him, and got off his horse. The old
fellow did not seem quite so pleased at this, and made signs as
if he now wanted the whites to go away, again.</p>

<p>'They're up to some little hanky-panky of their own, and don't
want us to stay and see it,' said Nicholls; and this was
undoubtedly what the old moan wanted to convey. Rolleston, with
his bridle on his arm, advanced towards the shelving rock, but
the blacks gathered together before the entrance, and did not
seem inclined to permit his intrusion in the cave.</p>

<p>Seeing that a collision would ensue if he persisted in his
purpose, Rolleston changed the direction and continued between
the two peaks, the others following, and the blacks keeping with
them. To this the blacks seemed to have no objection, and they
went slowly round and overlooked the country on the other side of
Doubletop.</p>

<p>They noticed a spring trickling from under a rock on the
largest of the peaks, and the open ground around was littered
with the marks of bygone camps, and the ashes of fires. In fact,
the place looked as though it had been the habitual resort of the
natives for many generations. The head of a scrubby ravine ran
down from between the twin peaks, and the country beyond was wild
and broken.</p>

<p>Nicholls was the last man to pass the cave, and he had
dismounted, taking his carbine in his hand. The sun had sunk
behind some clouds, but just as he went slowly by, a beam of
light shot through a rift and penetrated the obscurity of the
cave, overshadowed as it was by the shelving rock. It lit up a
jumble of round white stones, as they appeared to him at first,
and then the sun came out in full, and he saw clearly the
contents of the place that the blacks were so anxious to keep
concealed. Then the sun vanished again and the dusky shadows
obscured the view. He said nothing, and made no sign, but kept
on. Their situation had become too ticklish to precipitate
matters just then.</p>

<p>At last, after they had taken a good look at all the
surroundings, Rolleston intimated to the blacks that they were
going to return, at which there seemed much relief amongst the
natives. They also seemed most anxious to avoid a rupture with
the whites, and assured them of their goodwill, but equally
desirous that they should depart and leave them alone.</p>

<p>They mounted and rode down the spur, keeping a sharp lookout
as they descended; but the blacks stood quietly in a group and
watched them, motionless, until they were lost to view. As soon
as they were behind a convenient ridge, out of sight of the hill,
Rolleston pulled up, and the others gathered around.</p>

<p>'They're up to some of their ceremonies, which they don't like
whites to see,' said the manager; 'but I can't make out what it
is. They're not going to initiate the young men, for they have no
boys amongst them.'</p>

<p>'Piccaninny there,' said the blackboy.</p>

<p>'Where?' asked Rolleston.</p>

<p>'See 'em track, longa fire.'</p>

<p>'He's right,' added Nicholls; 'I saw them, two of them, in the
cave, and I believe they were half-castes, too.'</p>

<p>'Did you go into the cave?'</p>

<p>'No, but after you fellows passed, the sun came out just for a
minute, and shone right in. I saw that it was piled up with
skulls, a regular old burial place, I've seen them before on the
coast, and the two piccaninnies were in there.'</p>

<p>'You said you thought they were half-castes; young native
children are very light.'</p>

<p>'I know, but these were not babies; they were a few years old,
and they're black enough by that time if they're genuine
combos.'</p>

<p>'I wish we had looked in that cave.'</p>

<p>'That's why I said nothing up there; there would have been an
all-fired row, and they had plenty of weapons handy.'</p>

<p>'You bet,' said Reddy.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you were right,' returned Rolleston; 'but what are
they going to do with the little wretches?'</p>

<p>'That's their burial ground, so perhaps they intend to kill
them.'</p>

<p>'Queer! Out west where I was they stick their dead up in
trees.'</p>

<p>'But these niggers go on to the coast sometimes, and lots of
the coast niggers bury in caves; at least the skulls. I never saw
all the skeleton.'</p>

<p>'Supposing we go back to-night,' suggested Reddy.</p>

<p>'Yes,' returned Rolleston; 'we could go round and come up that
gully on the other side. I should dearly like to see what they
are going to do. I have heard that they kill half-castes, but
always when they are babies.'</p>

<p>'So have I; but those I saw were no babies,' returned
Nicholls.</p>

<p>They rode on till dusk, to deceive the blacks, who might run
their tracks to make sure, and then formed their plans over their
evening meal. They had got a pretty good look at the country from
the top of the hill, and by keeping well round could reach the
foot of the scrubby ravine, with comparative ease. Up the ravine
they would go on foot, and by good fortune might be able to
overlook the operations of the blacks.</p>

<p>They were all armed as firearms went in those days, and even
if discovered would have a good show against the blacks. There
was no doubt that the natives, who were all strong, well-grown
men, would resent their watching if they were discovered, but
Rolleston thought that the presence of the children, and what
seemed their probable fate, was quite sufficient
justification.</p>

<p>It took them some time to work round the mountain, but the
moon was nearly three-quarters full, and they presently found
themselves approaching Doubletop from the opposite side to the
way they had come before.</p>

<p>Many twinkling fires made a bright light on the crest, and
silently they secured their horses at the foot of the gaily, and
made ready for the ascent. They had to go slowly, and with great
care, for the moon threw puzzling shadows in the scrub, and they
felt thankful when the droning sound of a chant arose, which
would help to drown the noise made by a slip or a false step.</p>

<h3>PART 2. &mdash; THE STORY FINISHED BY ROLLESTON</h3>

<p class="first">
I SHALL never forget that night, both, on account of the
strange scene we witnessed and the narrow squeak we had for our
lives. Fortunately, my companions were good men. Reddy was rather
excitable, but Nicholls was one of those fellows who make sure
first, but are prompt and quick when they do act. The black boy,
Frank, had been brought up amongst the whites, was stolid, and
very exact in doing what he was told, and this trait of his led
to our extrication from a very tight place.</p>

<p>We reached the ridge of the scrub at the head of the ravine,
and there, concealed under good cover, watched what was going on.
There was a half circle of fires, and within the horns of the
crescent formed by them, and exposed to their united glare, lay
the dead body of a man. He was stretched on his back, with his
arms arranged straight down by his sides. His eyes had not been
closed, and his beard, which was peaked and grey, stuck up in the
air in fantastic fashion, projecting from his poked-up chin, for
his head was tilted back, there being no support under the back
of his head. I took so much notice of his position, and so did
the other men, from the fact that the body had a strong
fascination for all of us; for, in spite of its wildness,
sun-tanned and gaunt and scarred as it was, it was the body of a
white man.</p>

<p>By the side of the corpse were the two children Nicholls had
seen in the cave. One seemed about five or six years old, the
other a little younger. They were both boys, and stood holding
tight to each other's hands, but making no outcry, though they
must have been frightened. There was no doubt about their
parentage&mdash;they were half breeds, and the dead man was their
father.</p>

<p>Who was he, and why had he not returned to his countrymen? The
country had been settled nearly three years, and during that time
some opportunities of doing so must have offered themselves.</p>

<p>Three of the old men were standing near the body, and the rest
were squatting about the fires, keeping up a monotonous kind of
chant. Presently some of the younger men approached, and kneeling
down commenced digging a grave. This they did very quickly,
working with a sharp pointed stick in their right hand, and with
the left scooping the earth out. They did not take long to
excavate a shallow trench, rather wider than what was seemingly
required for the purpose of burial.</p>

<p>The body was then placed in it in the same position as that in
which it had been lying on the ground. One of the old men picked
up a heavy club, and, with no doubt of his intention, took one of
the children by the hand, and led him towards the grave, the
other little fellow following, still holding his brother's hand.
There was no time to wait or hesitate. I had a Westley Richards
breech-loader and Nicholls a Terry. Reddy was armed with a
double-barrelled muzzle loader, one barrel for shot and one for
ball.</p>

<p>What with the moonlight and firelight it was easy shooting,
and the old murderer fell, both Reddy and I having hit him,
whilst Nicholls had dropped one of the other old men. Reddy
immediately fired his shot charge at the third greybeard.</p>

<p>The surprise was sudden and complete. Engaged in their burial
ceremony, and the human sacrifice that was to follow it, they had
quite forgotten our visit in the afternoon, or the chance of our
returning. All but the children and the three greybeards
disappeared amongst the shadows of the rocks. The two fallen men
lay still, the other, wounded with a charge of duck shot, crawled
slowly on his hands and knees out of the firelight.</p>

<p>'Get the kids, and clear out as quick as we can,' cried
Nicholls, as we re-loaded. We ran forward, but the children were
frightened, and we had to pick them up and hold them by force,
and such imps to struggle and kick I never saw before or
since.</p>

<p>'Too late,' said Reddy, as a spear or two was thrown at us,
and I saw to my dismay that they came from the scrub. The blacks
had seized their weapons, hidden in the rocks, and had entered
the scrubby ravine lower down, thus cutting our retreat off.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, we made for the cave under the projecting
rock, and reached it in safety with the children just as the
missiles began to come fast and furious. It was the only thing to
be done, for we would have had no chance in the open with the
blacks amongst the rocks of the two peaks, and to retreat down
the spur we had ridden up in the afternoon with the blacks above
us all the way would have been certain death. In the cave we were
pretty safe, but how were we to get out?</p>

<p>The cave faced the second peak, a hundred yards distant; and
no one could show out opposite in the space between under our
fire. Nor could they assail us from the opposite peak, for the
shelving rock protected the entrance like a broad verandah. As
soon as we reached our lair I missed Frank, the black boy. We
called him, but got no answer, and none of us recalled having
seen him after we fired. In all probability he had turned and run
back instead of forward, and escaped down the ravine, safely,
before the blacks got into it.</p>

<p>By the aid of a few matches we found the cave shelved back;
for a good distance, and was littered with, skulls throughout,
more than two hundred of them, as I found out afterwards. There
were some fallen rocks, too, which would serve as cover.</p>

<p>The blacks kept very quiet on the open in front of the
entrance; they knew too much to dare to show up. However, we
expected a rush, and presently they made one. They crept up very
noiselessly on each side of the entrance, but Nicholls, who was
on the look out, saw their shadows moving, and we were behind the
rocks, and ready for them, when they came. They rushed in in a
body, with such impetus that they sprawled over the men who fell
to our first discharge, but our revolvers served us well at close
quarters, and they gave back, and the wounded ones crawled after
them.</p>

<p>They were still for so long that we indulged in a smoke, and
the hope that they had had enough of it and retired. But Reddy,
incautiously poking his head out to have a look round, nearly got
his brains let out with a nulla. There seemed nothing for it but
to watch, and wait for daylight, and then make the best fight we
could of it, and we had some dreary hours, in prospect, added to
which there was the certainty that they would probably find our
horses at the foot of the ravine, and spear them.</p>

<p>The moon had begun to sink low behind the peak in which our
refuge was situated, and throw its shadow in front of the
entrance, so that the dividing strip of land between the two
peaks became so gloomy that we could not well see anything moving
there after a couple of hours had passed. This added to our
danger, but Nicholls took advantage of it to creep to the
entrance and reconnoitre, with comparative safety. He stayed for
some time, and, when he returned, said that he could hear the
blacks moving about on the sides of the peak above us, but what
the-were doing he could not make out.</p>

<p>We were soon to find out. He went again to the entrance, and
suddenly dashed outside, wheeled and fired above him, and bolted
back.</p>

<p>'They are bringing fire to smoke us out,' he cried. 'I dropped
one fellow on top of the rock.'</p>

<p>This was bad news. The darkness was increasing, and by coming
along to the edge of the shelving rock, they could easily build
up a fire in perfect safety. And then some green boughs would
soon make us try to force our way out.</p>

<p>It was a cheerful outlook, and there seemed no way of stopping
them.</p>

<p>Reddy suggested making a bolt for the opposite peak, and
getting cover among the broken rocks there, but on consideration
the odds were too great. They could find cover better than we
could, and once they got us separated they would make short work
of us.</p>

<p>All this time the little ones, the cause of all the trouble,
were lying still and quiet, without moving. I don't think they
exactly knew what we had saved them from, nor were, at that time,
at all thankful to us for what we had done. Presently there was a
great shout from up above that startled us somewhat, and down
came a mass of blazing wood in front of the cave, more and more
dry wood followed it, so fast that it was useless to endanger
ourselves by trying to scatter the brands.</p>

<p>They must have been gathering the material together while they
were so quiet, and from their position they could lean over the
ledge of the rock and pelt the faggots underneath. There was soon
a blazing fire, and then down came bunches of green scrub, and
the smoke began to fill the cave, and make our eyes water, and
made us cough.</p>

<p>To add to the pleasure of the thing there were two dead bodies
at the mouth, under this hail of fire, and they began to frizzle
and cook, making the smell very juicy. However, by lying down
behind our rocks, with our mouths close to the ground, we managed
to hang out for a good bit, but I never hope to put in such a
time again. My eyes and throat were smarting, and I felt as
though I had a tight band of iron round my chest.</p>

<p>Suddenly the natives who had been yelling all the time stopped
making a noise, and the rain of bushes stopped too. What could be
up? Nothing could be heard but the crackling of the fire.</p>

<p>'Let's make a rush now!' growled Reddy, in a kind of hoarse
croak. We did so, dashing through the fire into the pure
delicious night air beyond. We drew deep inspirations of it, and
then stood and looked round. The moon had nearly set, and the
shadows thrown by its dying yellow light were long, black, and
gaunt. All around was silent, but from below came the rattle and
tramp of saddled horses, and a familiar voice crying, 'Get up
there!' 'Go on!'</p>

<p>'It's Frank driving the horses up the way we came in the
afternoon!' shouted Nicholls. 'That's what started the niggers
away.'</p>

<p>We gave three cheers for Frank, which must have considerably
startled the niggers within hearing. Then, I must confess, for
the first time we thought of the youngsters, and we pushed back
into the cave. They were pretty well choked, but we got them out
all right, and just then Frank and the nags appeared. He was
astonished at the hearty welcome we gave him, and at the
condition of affairs, for he knew nothing of our predicament.</p>

<p>It was his job to look after the horses, and do the
horse-hunting, and when we fired the first time he thought that
some might break away, or the runaway blacks might scare them,
and so hurried back down the gully to them, and escaped the
enemy.</p>

<p>He found he could not get them up the ravine single-handed, so
drove them round the hill to the spur we had come up: it had
taken him a long time for he had to make a wide sweep, and being
alone, the horses gave a lot of trouble, but he arrived in the
very nick of time.</p>

<p>Daylight was not far off, and we boiled our quarts and made an
early breakfast, and gave the youngsters something to eat. By
this time they seemed beginning to understand that we were their
friends. When day broke we examined our surroundings more closely
than we had done the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>The body of the white man lying in the shallow grave naturally
attracted our special attention. The face did not display any
particular type or class, and the features were of those of an
ordinary bush-worker. One hand was maimed and deformed from an
old wound. We filled the grave in, and I marked a tree which
happened to stand at the head of it.</p>

<p>Searching about we found many bundles of blackfellows' gear
hidden amongst the rocks, and one of them seemed to have belonged
to the dead white man.</p>

<p>There were in it many articles of civilised make, amongst them
a muzzle-loading double-barrelled pistol, a sheath knife, a
broken silver-mounted meerschaum pipe, and, carefully wrapped up,
a faded photograph. A poor thing, taken by some travelling
photographer when the art was in its childhood. It was the
portrait of a country girl, in her best clothes, and with a broad
smile on her round face. On the back, scarcely decipherable, was
written: 'To Joe, from Lizzie, with her love.'</p>

<p>All through his wandering savage life the man had carried and
treasured this token of his past.</p>

<p>An exclamation from Reddy withdrew my attention from this bit
of romance. He was examining the sheath knife, on the handle of
which some letters were rudely carved.</p>

<p>'S.C.R.A.M.M.Y.,' he read out; then, turning the knife round,
read on the other side of the handle, 'J.O.E., Scrammy Joe!'</p>

<p>The name meant nothing to me, but Nicholls and Reddy
recognised it at once.</p>

<p>'Scrammy Joe,' said Nicholls, 'why, that was the fellow who
shot his mate and cleared out with the horse when the police were
after him. How did his knife get up here?'</p>

<p>'That must be Scrammy himself lying there,' returned
Reddy.</p>

<p>'That's him, with his twisted hand, that made him get the
nickname Scrammy. He's been here, with the 'blacks ever since,
and they thought he had got clear away.'</p>

<p>The story had never come to my ears, but it was well-known to
my two companions. Scrammy Joe was a young native youth with a
weakness for horses, other people's horses in particular. This
led him to join one of the bushranging gangs then in existence,
and one or two murders led to his being outlawed in common with
the others. Scrammy and a companion were being chased by the
troopers, and Scrammy was badly mounted, while his mate had one
of the best horses in the district, stolen of course. Evidently,
Scrammy thought it was a case of the hangman taking the hindmost,
so he shot his mate, mounted the good horse, and rode easily
away, and was never heard of again.</p>

<p>The dying outlaw lived long enough to tell the police how he
met his fate, and Scrammy must have known that for him there
could be no return. No one would have given him shelter, and
everybody would join to hunt him down. Evidently he must have
pushed out into the then unknown country, and finally been
accepted amongst a tribe of blacks. He would seem to have
attained to some influence amongst them, and it was not until his
death that they had dared to attempt to carry out their custom of
killing the half-caste children.</p>

<p>This would account for his making no attempt to rejoin the
whites when he heard of their proximity. Fancy the man who did
not hesitate to shoot his mate in cold blood, in order to secure
the means of escape, preserving and keeping carefully the
portrait of his old sweetheart!</p>

<p>We took the children in to the station, and they grew up good
useful men. I sent in a report to the proper authorities, and in
time the body was exhumed and identified by some one sent up on
purpose, who had known the dead man well.</p>

<p>In the official report sent in it was stated that the blacks
had evidently revisited the place, and removed all the skulls
from the cave. This was only true, in a sense. The skulls had
certainly been removed, but not by the blacks. I happened to have
a cousin a sailor, who did very well out of a number of skulls he
collected when island-cruising, and I remembered the incident.
Before the authorities visited the scene Nicholls, Reddy, and I
had removed the skulls to a safe place, and we eventually did
very well out of them.</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. &mdash; THE PEST YEAR OF 1905</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 2 April 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was during the prolonged drought of 1904-1905, just about
Christmas time of the former year, that the steamer
<i>Niagara</i> fell in with an apparently abandoned barquentine
about fifty miles from Sydney. It was calm, fine weather, so,
failing to get any response to their hail, the chief officer
boarded her. He returned with the report that she was perfectly
seaworthy and in good order, but that they could find no one on
board, living or dead. The captain went on board, and, being so
close to port, he was thinking of putting some hands on her to
bring her into Port Jackson, when a perusal of the log book in
the captain's cabin made him hesitate.</p>

<p>From the entries it seemed that the crew had sickened and
died, of some kind of malignant fever, the only survivors being
three men, a passenger, one sailor, and the cook. The last entry,
which was nearly three weeks old, stated that these three had
provisioned a boat and intended leaving the vessel and making for
Australia as the only chance of saving their lives, as they felt
sure that the vessel was infested with plague.</p>

<p>The value of the barquentine and cargo being considerable, and
the weather settled, the captain determined to tow her into port.
He put three volunteers on board to steer her, took her in tow,
and brought her into Port Jackson, and anchored off the
Quarantine Ground. On reporting the matter to the medical officer
he was ordered to remain at anchor until it was decided what
course to take.</p>

<p>The season was very hot and unhealthy, and when the story
spread it occasioned a slight scare amongst the citizens. Both
vessels were quarantined, and the barquentine thoroughly
examined. When it was found from the log that the deserted craft
had sailed from an Indian port, where the plague that had so long
devastated Southern Asia was then raging furiously, the
consternation grew into a panic. It was determined to take the
vessel to sea and burn her&mdash;nothing else would pacify the
public. The claim of the owners and the salvage claim for
compensation were rated, and the <i>Niagara</i> towed the
derelict out to sea and set fire to her, and then returned to
undergo a term of quarantine.</p>

<p>Nothing further occurred, and in due course the <i>Niagara</i>
was released, and people forgot the fright they had entertained.
The drought reigned unbroken, and the heat continued to range
higher than ever. Then, when the winter had passed, and a dry
spring betokened the coming of another summer of drought and
heat, a mortal sickness made its appearance in some of the
low-lying suburbs of Sydney. When it had grown to an alarming
extent, grim stories got to be bruited about, and a tale that one
of the sailors of the <i>Niagara</i> had told was repeated.</p>

<p>He was on watch the night before the vessel was to be
destroyed, the two ships, lying anchored pretty close together.
It was about 2 o'clock when his attention was drawn to a peculiar
noise on board the plague ship. He listened intently, and
recognised the squealing of rats, and a low, pattering noise as
though all the rats on the ship were gathering together. And so
they were. By the light of the moon his quick eyes detected
something moving on the cable. The rats were leaving the ship.
Down the cable they went in what seemed to be an endless
procession, into the water, and straight ashore they swam. They
passed under the bow of the <i>Niagara</i>, and the sailor
declared it seemed nearly half an hour before the last straggler
swam past. He lost sight of them in the shadow of the shore, but
he heard the curious subdued murmur they made for some time. The
sailor little thought as he watched this strange exodus from the
doomed ship that he had witnessed an invasion of Australia
portending greater disaster than the entrance of a hostile fleet
through the Heads. The horror of the tale was augmented by the
fact that the suburbs afflicted were now haunted by numberless
rats.</p>

<p>People began to fly from the neighborhood, and soon some of
the most populous ones were empty and deserted. This spread the
evil, and before long plague was universal in the city, and the
authorities and their medical advisers at their wits' end to cope
with and check me scourge.</p>

<p>The following account is from the diary of one who passed
unscathed through the Affliction. Strange to, say, none of the
crew of the <i>Niagara</i> were attacked, nor was the boat with
the three survivors ever heard of.</p>

<p><br>
'&mdash;THE weather is still unchanged. It seems as though a
cloud would never appear in the sky again. Day after day the
thermometer rises during the afternoon to 115 deg in the shade,
with unvarying regularity. No wind comes, save puffs of hot air,
which penetrate everywhere. The harbor is lifeless, and the water
seems stagnant and rotting. And now, dead bodies are floating in
what were once the clear, sparkling waters of Port Jackson. Most
of these are the corpses of unfortunates, stricken with plague
madness, when in their delirium, plunge into the water, which has
a fatal fascination for them. They float untouched, for it is
reported, and I believe with truth, that the very sharks have
deserted these tainted shores. The sanitary cordon once drawn
around the city has long since been abandoned. The plague now
rages throughout the whole continent. The very birds of the air
seem to carry the infection far and wide. All steamers have
stopped running, for they dare not leave port, in case of being
disabled at sea by their crews sickening and dying. All the ports
of the world are closed against Australian vessels. Ghastly
stories are told of ships floating around our coasts, drifting
hither and thither, manned only by the dead. Our sole
communication with the outer world is by cable, and that is
uncertain, for some of the land operators have been found dead at
the instruments.</p>

<p><br>
THE dead are now beginning to lie about the streets, for the
fatigue parties are overworked, and the cremation furnaces are
not yet available. Yesterday I was in George-street, and saw
three bodies lying in the Post Office Colonnade. Dogs were
sniffing at them, and the horrible rats that now infest every
place ran boldly about. There is now no traffic but the death
carts, and the silence of the once noisy street is awful. The
only places open for business are the hotel bars, for many hold
that alcohol is a safeguard against the plague, and drink to
excess, only to die of heat apoplexy. People who meet look
curiously at each other to see if either bears the plague blotch
on their face.</p>

<p>Religious mania is now common. The Salvation Army parade the
streets praying and singing. The other day I saw, when kneeling
in a circle, that two of them never rose again. They remained
kneeling, smitten to death by the plague. The captain, as he
called himself, raised a cry of 'Halleluiah! More souls for
Jesus!' and then the whole crew, in their gaudy equipments, went
marching down the echoing street, the big drum banging, its
loudest. As the noise of their hysterical concert faded round a
corner a death cart rambled up and the two victims were
unceremoniously pitched into it; one of the men remarking,
'Tain't rotten ones, this time, better luck!' Such was the
requiem passed on departed spirits by those whose occupation had
long since made them callous to suffering and death.</p>

<p>All the medical profession stuck nobly to their posts, though
death was busy amongst their ranks. And volunteers among the
nurses, male and female, were never wanting, as places had to be
filled. But what could medical science do against a disease that
recognised no conventional rules, and raged in the open country
the same as in the crowded towns? Experts from Europe and America
came over and sacrificed their lives, and still no check could be
found. All now agreed that the only chance in an atmospheric
disturbance that would break up the drought and dispel the
stagnant atmosphere that brooded like a nightmare over the
continent. But the meteorologists could give no hope. All that
they could say was that a cycle of rainless years had set in, and
that at some former time Australia had passed through the same
experience. A strange comet, too, of unprecedented size, had made
its appearance in the southern hemisphere, and astronomers were
at loss to account for the visitor. And the fiery portent flamed
in the midnight sky, further adding to the terrors of the
superstitious.</p>

<p>It was during one night, when walking late through the
stricken city, I met with the following adventure. My work at the
hospitals had been hard, but I felt no fatigue. The despair
brooding over everyone had shadowed me with its influence. Think
what it was to be shut up in a pest city without a chance of
escape, either by sea or land. I wandered through the streets,
Campbell's lines running in my head, 'And ships were drifting
with the dead to shores where all was dumb.' Suddenly a door
opened, and a young woman staggered out, and reeling, almost fell
against me. I supported her, and she seemed to somewhat recover
from the frightful horror that had apparently seized her. She
stared at me, then said, 'Oh! I can stand it no longer. The rats
came first, and now hideous things have come through the window,
and are watching his breath go out. Are you a doctor?'</p>

<p>'I am not a doctor,' I answered; 'but I am one of those who
attend to the dying. It is all we can do.'</p>

<p>'Will you come with me? My husband is dying, and I dare not go
back alone, and I dare not leave him to die alone. He has raved
of fearful things.'</p>

<p>The street lamps were unlighted, but by the glare of the
threatening comet that lit up the heavens I could, see her face,
and the mortal terror in it. I was just reassuring her when
someone approaching stopped close to us.</p>

<p>'Ha, ha!' laughed the stranger, who was frenzied with drink.
'Another soul going to be damned. Let me see him. I'll cheer him
on his way,' and he waved a bottle of whisky. I turned to
remonstrate with the fellow, when I saw a change come over his
face that transformed it from the frenzy of intoxication into
comparative sobriety.</p>

<p>'Your name, woman; your husband's name?' he gasped. As if
compelled to answer she replied, 'Sandover, Herbert
Sandover!'</p>

<p>'Can I come, too,' said the man, addressing me in an altered
tone. 'I know Herbert, knew him of old. But his wife doesn't
remember me.'</p>

<p>'Keep quiet and don't disturb the dying,' I said, and giving
my arm to the woman went into the house. We ascended the stairs
and entered a bedroom; the rats scampered, squeaking, before us.
On the bed lay a man, plague-stricken, and raving in delirium. No
wonder. On the rail at the head of the bed and on the rail at the
foot sat two huge bats. Not the harmless Australian variety that
lives in the twilight limestone caves; nor the fruit-eating
flying fox; but a larger kind still, the hideous flesh-feeding
vampire of New Guinea and Borneo. For since Australia became a
pest house the flying carnivora of the Archipelago had invaded
the continent.</p>

<p>There sat these demon-like creatures with their vulpine heads
and huge leathery wings, with which they were slowly fanning the
air. And the dying man lay and raved at them. Disturbed by our
entrance the obscene things flapped slowly out of the open
window, and the sick man turned to us with a hideous laugh, which
was echoed by the strange man who had joined us.</p>

<p>'Herbert Sandover,' he said, 'you know me, Bill Kempton, the
man you robbed and ruined. I'm just in time to see you die. I
came to Australia after you to twist your thievish neck, but
plague has done it. Grin man, grin, it's pleasant to meet an old
friend.'</p>

<p>I tried to stop him, but vainly, and from the look on the
dying man's face I could see that it was a case of recognition in
reality. The woman had sunk upon her knees and buried her head in
her hands. Kempton still continued his mad taunting. Taking a
tumbler from the table he poured some whisky into it and drank
it.</p>

<p>'This is the stuff to keep the plague away,' he shouted; 'but
you, Sandover, never drank. Oh, no! too clever for that. Spoil
your nerve for cheating. But I'll live, you cur, and see you
tumbled into the death cart.'</p>

<p>So he raved at the dying man, and one of the great vampires
came back and perched on the window-sill. Raising himself in bed
by a last effort, Sandover fixed his eyes on the thing, and
screamed that it should not come for him before his time. As if
incensed by his gestures, the vampire suddenly sprang fiercely at
him, uttering a whistling snarl of rage. Fixing its talons in him
and burying its teeth in his neck, it commenced worrying the poor
wretch, and buffeting him with its wings.</p>

<p>Calling to Kempton, I rushed forward to try and beat it off,
but its mate suddenly appeared. Quite powerless to aid, I picked
up the woman, who had fainted, and carried her out of the room.
Kempton, now quite mad, continued fighting the vampires, but at
last, torn and bleeding, he followed us into the street. I was
endeavoring to restore the woman, and he only stopped to assure
me that the devils were eating Sandover, and then reeled off.</p>

<p>When the woman came to her senses I left her by her own
request to wait till the death cart came round. I called there
the next morning, but I never saw her again. Amidst such sights
and scenes as these the summer passed on, burning and relentless.
The cattle and sheep were dying in hundreds and thousands, and it
looked as though Australia would soon be a lifeless waste, ever
to remain so.</p>

<p><br>
ONE morning it was posted up that news had come from Eucla
that the barometer there gave notice of an atmospheric
disturbance approaching from, the south-west That was all, and no
more could be elicited. The line-men at tine next station started
to ascertain the cause of the silence, and, after a few days they
wired to say that they had found the men on the station all dead.
But the self-registering instruments had continued their work,
and the storm was daily expected at Cape Leeuwin.</p>

<p>The days preceding our deliverance from the pest were some of
the worst experienced; as though the approaching storm drove
before it all the foul brooding vapors that had so long oppressed
us, and they had assembled to make a last stand on the east
coast. One morning I felt a change, a cool change, in the
air.</p>

<p>Going into the street, I saw, to my surprise, many people
there, gathered to gather in groups, and gazing upwards at a
strange eight. The vampires were leaving the city. Ceaseless
columns of them were flying eastward, and men watched them with
relieved faces, as though a dream of maddening horror was passing
away. Then came a sound, such as must have been heard in the
quaint old city of legendary lore when the pied piper sounded has
magic flute. The pest rats were flying. Forth they came,
unheeding the people who stood about; and eastward they commenced
their march.</p>

<p><br>
ALL that day it continued, and some reported that they plunged
into the sea, and disappeared. At any rate, they vanished
utterly, and with them other loathsome vermin that had been
fattening on the dead and the living dead. Everyone seemed to see
new life ahead. Men spoke cheerily to each other of adopting
means for clearing and cleansing the city, but that work was
taken out of our hands. That night the cyclonic system that had
raged across the continent burst upon us. All the long dormant
forces of the air seemed to have met in conflict. For three days
its fury was appalling. The violent rain and constant thunder and
lightning added to the tumult. No one stirred out during those
three days of tempest and destruction. Nature in her own mighty
way had set to work to purge the country of the plague. It was
while this storm was at its fiercest that the post office tower
and the town hall tower were destroyed, and hurled in ruins to
the ground. No one, as far as I know, witnessed the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The morning of the fourth day broke calm, clear, and
beautiful. At midnight the tempest had lulled, and when daylight
came the sun rose in a sky lightly flecked with roseate morning
clouds. Accompanied by a friend, I started out to see the ruined
city, and those who were left alive in it. The streets still ran
with flood water, but the higher levels had pretty well drained
off, and, once they were gained, our progress was easy. Martin
Place was choked with the ruins of the tower, and many other
buildings had succumbed; while not a single verandah was left
standing in any street.</p>

<p>We went to the harbor. The tide was receding, carrying with it
the turbid waters that rushed into it from all points; carrying
with it, too, wreckage and human bodies. A strong current was
setting seaward through the Heads, and bore out to the Pacific
all the rotting remnants of the past visitation.</p>

<p>The deserted, ships in the harbor had been torn from, their
moorings and either sunk or blown ashore. Wreck and desolation
were visible everywhere, but the air was pure, cool, and
grateful; and our hearts rose in spite of the difficulties that
lay before us, for the looming horror of the plague had been
lifted.</p>

<p><br>
OF what followed your histories tell you. How the overwhelming
disaster knit the colonies together in a closer federation than
legislators ever forged. How from that hour has sprung a new,
purged and purified Australian race. All this, to the record of
the Australian nation; mine are but some reminiscences of a time
of horror unparalleled which no man anticipated would have
visited Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>27. &mdash; THE BOY AND THE BLACK</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 20, 26 Oct 1900</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
JOHNNIE MURCHISON, small boy, looked round the station
homestead, and wondered what he would do. It was holiday time,
and therefore, Johnnie found that old despot Time hang heavily
upon his hands. His usual occupations had grown wearisome, and he
longed for something new and fresh in the way of pastime.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning, soon after breakfast, and
everybody had gone to work, and Johnnie was alone. He had no
desire for the company of his mother, for she would surely set
him something to do which he disliked; so he stood on the
verandah, and looked round, and thought within himself that all
was dust and ashes.</p>

<p>A thin smoke rising in the distance suggested the idea of the
camp of the blacks hanging about the homestead. The blacks' camp
was taboo to Johnnie, therefore, on this particular morning, when
time hung heavily on his hands, he felt particularly attracted
towards it.</p>

<p>King Paddy was, without doubt, a most attractive old man, but
the rules and regulations were strictly against his having
anything to say to Paddy on his own account.</p>

<p>Johnnie looked around. The pet emu was breaking all rules and
regulations by wandering around the stables. The magpie was
meditating an onslaught on the sleeping cat, and the gardener was
having a quiet smoke-oh, even at that early hour. Every living
thing appeared to be breaking rules and regulations, therefore
why should Johnnie Murchison be exempt? The boy who hesitates is
lost, in common with the man, therefore Johnnie hesitated, and
decided to visit that nice old man, King Paddy.</p>

<p>Once committed, Johnnie had no scruples. He had not heard of
the proverb that one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a
lamb, but he proceeded to act on the principle. He first visited
the store. The storekeeper was busy with his books, and did not
see Johnnie filch some figs of tobacco from an opened case. A tin
of jam and one of preserved milk formed all the spoils Johnnie
could safely carry, and with these he departed.
He&mdash;Johnnie&mdash;had made up his mind to have a day's
outing with King Paddy, and to bribe that dusky potentate with
his ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>Johnnie found the king in a complacent humor. He was just out
of tobacco, and a fig from Johnnie meant much, therefore his
majesty was all smiles.</p>

<p>'Were you ever an outlaw?' asked Johnnie, when Paddy was well
on for his smoke.</p>

<p>'You say outlaw,' said Paddy. 'My word! Mine been twenty time
outlaw. One time alonga of killem twelve white fellow, then
alonga five blackfellow, and then I forget who; but I bin outlaw
plenty time, you bet.'</p>

<p>'Paddy,' said Johnnie, in a hesitating voice, 'do you mind
being an outlaw with me? I've got a tin of jam and preserved
milk, and some tobacco, that will last us until we can rob a
hut.'</p>

<p>Paddy reflected.</p>

<p>'You see,' he said, 'dis outlaw business cost money.'</p>

<p>Johnnie shook his head. Jam and other stores were fair game,
but he had an honest horror about money.</p>

<p>'I suppose I, could do it,' said Paddy reflectively; 'but we
must have something to shoot with. Outlaws not good without
shooting.'</p>

<p>'I've got my gun,' said Johnnie. 'But, Paddy, do you know of a
cave. Outlaws always have caves.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Paddy mendaciously, 'I know heaps of caves.
There's the one under the big fig tree.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Johnnie regretfully, 'everybody knows that cave. We
should be found at once.'</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Paddy, 'I know plenty more caves.'</p>

<p>'Will you come, Paddy?' said the boy, 'and be an outlaw, and
live in a cave?'</p>

<p>'My word!' said Paddy. 'Me come all right.'</p>

<p>The boy stood waiting while Paddy reflected. At last he spoke,
'You go back, get em shot gun, belonging you, tea and sugar, and
meet me alonga old fellow tree' at lagoon paddock.'</p>

<p>The boy nodded a joyful assent. This was something like the
joy of life&mdash;a man had been killed at the old man tree at
the lagoon.</p>

<p>True to his word, Paddy was at the old man tree at the lagoon,
awaiting the coming of the son and heir of Bigolong station.
Paddy was but lightly attired, and he kindly allowed Johnnie to
carry all the equipment. So the pair started out to be
outlaws.</p>

<p>'Seems to me,' said Paddy, 'that we'd better go alonga road,
meet 'em traveller, and stick him up.' Johnnie eagerly assented,
but he was rather undecided when they met a traveller, and all
that Paddy did was to whine for baccy.</p>

<p>'Mine think it,' said Paddy, 'we go alonga pub at crossing,
and stick up that fella publican.'</p>

<p>This looked very much like the real thing, and Johnnie tramped
contentedly alongside of Paddy until the pub was reached, and
then Paddy suggested that probably Johnnie had thixpense on
him.</p>

<p>'But I thought you were going to take the gun and stick up the
publican?' said Johnnie.</p>

<p>'Yowl. Me take 'em gun alright. But carry thixpense, too.'</p>

<p>Paddy departed for the pub, and Johnnie waited anxiously,
expecting to be called when he would find the publican and all
hands tied up. No shots, however, were heard, and presently Paddy
returned without the gun, and a suspicious bulge is his shirt
front.</p>

<p>'No good,' he said, reflecting, 'too many white fellow sit
down.' 'Where's the gun?' asked Johnnie. 'Mine 'bin plant 'am,'
said Paddy. 'Mine think it we sit down alonga crossing, and wait
for traveller.' The day was getting warm and Johnnie assented.
They went and camped alongside a waterhole where they could watch
the road. Paddy went down to the water and engaged in some
mysterious operations, which made him cough. When he came back,
there was no bulge in his shirt front.'</p>

<p>'You ever play about Red Indian?' asked Paddy.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Johnnie, 'if we stick up a traveller, we'll
scalp him.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Paddy, 'first time scalp 'em, you mine, 'bin read
'em,' and he drew his sheath knife and looked wicked at poor
Johnnie, but his mood relented, and he went down to the creek
again, and bad another fit of coughing.</p>

<p>When he came back, he said he would go back to the hut and see
if the people had left; if so, he would commence the slaughter.
He staggered off, and Johnnie began to think that the business of
outlaw was rather tame.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
JOHNNIE MURCHISON waited in great discontent for the king's
return. When at last the black monarch came, it was not at all a
victorious outlaw&mdash;on the contrary, he seemed to appear with
empty bottles flying after him. He sat down by Johnnie, and used
profane language about publicans in general.</p>

<p>'Where's the gun?' asked Johnnie.</p>

<p>'That fellow publican got it,' replied Jimmy coolly.</p>

<p>'Got my gun!' exclaimed Johnnie. 'Why, it's my property, not
yours.'</p>

<p>'Oh, proputty! I'm sick of that fellow proputty. Outlaws have
no proputty. I sell him gun for two bottles of rum, and he only
give me one bottle.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but, Jimmy, I must have my gun back.'</p>

<p>'Go and get it,' said Jimmy, who was three parts drunk.
Johnnie considered a moment, and then marched up to the public
house.</p>

<p>'You've my gun, Mr. Golding,' he said.</p>

<p>'What, the gun that Jimmy sold me?'</p>

<p>'Yes. If you don't give it me back, my father will see to it.
You knew it was not Jimmy's, and you gave him rum for it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, here's your gun, sonny; but old Jimmy had better not come
near me again.'</p>

<p>Johnnie took the gun and departed, his confidence in Jimmy
completely shaken. He found Jimmy asleep, but he woke up on
hearing Johnnie's tread.</p>

<p>'You got 'em gun, eh? Suppose I carry it; too heavy for
you.'</p>

<p>'No!' said Johnnie. 'I'll carry it myself now.'</p>

<p>'Well, you like it being outlaw?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't,' returned Johnnie; 'it's too tame altogether.
Why, we have not stuck up anybody yet, and all you have done is
drink a bottle of rum.'</p>

<p>'That's all right,' said Jimmy; 'outlaw always drink rum.'</p>

<p>'What are we going to do now?' asked Johnnie.</p>

<p>'Oh, stick up someone. What you think of Chinaman? Stick up
Chinaman garden&mdash;I think very good.'</p>

<p>This seemed somewhat definite, and Johnnie agreed. So the boy.
and the black proceeded along the dusty road, until the green
patch of the Chinaman's gardens appeared in sight.</p>

<p>'You go first, alonga a gun,' said Jimmy. 'That fellow
Chinaman frightened alonga me.'</p>

<p>So Johnnie went boldly first, Jimmy following. Two Chinamen
were working in the garden, and they did not appear at all
alarmed at Johnnie's appearance, but when they caught sight of
Jimmy they jabbered to one another, and came at him with their
hoes. Jimmy did not wait for the onslaught, but fled at once.</p>

<p>The two Chinamen came back, speaking most disrespectfully of
Jimmy as a 'd&mdash;d tief,' and asked Johnnie if he would like a
melon. Johnnie had no objection, but he thought it beneath the
dignity of an outlaw to accept one.</p>

<p>'You know I'm an outlaw,' he said.</p>

<p>'Welly good outlaw,' said one of the Chinamen. 'You Mr.
Murchison's son&mdash;me bin see you before.'</p>

<p>This was a great come down for Johnnie; but at any rate he
could now accept the melon with a good grace, which he did, and
very good it was. The Chinamen showed him over their garden, and
seemed very pleased to see him, which, considering the nature of
his occupation, was singular.</p>

<p>When Johnnie left, they gave him some preserved ginger to take
with him, and told him that if he met Jimmy, to shoot him, for he
was a bad man.</p>

<p>Johnnie knew that Jimmy was a bad man, but was he not an
outlaw? And was not Johnnie himself an outlaw? Therefore, he made
up his mind not to take the Chinaman's advice and shoot Jimmy,
although, doubtless, the advice was good and well meant.</p>

<p>He walked away along the road, and presently saw Jimmy
awaiting him under the shade of a tree.</p>

<p>'Well, outlaw,' said Jimmy, 'you stick op Chinaman all right,
I see.'</p>

<p>'No; they gave me this melon and preserved ginger.'</p>

<p>'All the same,' said Jimmy, accepting half the melon which
Johnnie had brought for him, and finishing up with some preserved
ginger.</p>

<p>'Jimmy,' said Johnnie, 'why did you run away just now?'</p>

<p>'Why, you see, those Chinamen and me not friends, and I bin
frightened that if I stayed I kill them.'</p>

<p>'But you left me alone.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that all right; Chinaman no hurt a boy like you.'</p>

<p>'Well, they said you were a bad man, and I ought to shoot you,
and I think I will, and then I'll be a real outlaw.'</p>

<p>'No, Johnnie,' whined his majesty, for Johnnie had begun to
handle his gun. 'You no shoot old man, Jimmy,' and the
blackfellow dodged towards a handy tree.</p>

<p>'Well, I won't shoot you this time,', returned Johnnie, who
had now found out his power; 'but if you don't do something like
a real outlaw the next time we have a chance I will shoot you.
One can always shoot outlaws where you meet them.'</p>

<p>'Well, where go? There's Joe White, got a selection a mile
away. Shall we stick him up and get dinner?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm getting hungry,' and they started. Joe White's
selection was reached just as White was going to dinner.</p>

<p>'Hullo, young Murchison!' he said, 'just in time for
dinner.'</p>

<p>Then, catching sight of Jimmy he added, 'Quick, lend me your
gun.'</p>

<p>Without remembering that he was an outlaw, Johnnie surrendered
his gun, but Jimmy was already going across the paddock like a
frightened wallaby. When Jimmy was a good way off, so the shots
would have little effect, he fired, and Jimmy gave a howl, and
cleared the fence at one gigantic bound.</p>

<p>'Did you shoot Jimmy because he is an outlaw, Mr. White?'
asked Johnnie. 'Is he an outlaw? I shot him to give him a warning
not to come prowling round my fowl yard after dark.'</p>

<p>'I'm an outlaw, too.'</p>

<p>'Are you, Johnnie? When did you become an outlaw?' 'This
morning. Jimmy and I started out to commence bushranging; but
there's been no fun in it. Jimmy's a coward!'</p>

<p>'Well, come in; Mrs. White will give you some dinner.'</p>

<p>'But I must tell you first, Mr. White, we were going to stick
up your place.'</p>

<p>Joe White laughed loud and long as he took Johnnie inside, and
said to his wife, 'Here's a young gentleman who was going to
stick up our place.'</p>

<p>'Bless the boy, what was he going to do that for? It's Johnnie
Murchison, too.'</p>

<p>'He and that old thief King Jimmy started to play at
bushranging this morning; but you haven't made a success of it,
have you, Johnnie?'</p>

<p>Johnnie had a splendid appetite, and was deep in his dinner,
so he only looked sheepish and grinned. When Johnnie had finished
Ms dinner, and was ready to go, Mrs. White gave him a lump of
cake to take home with him, warning him not to give it to Jimmy
if he met him. But Johnnie thought Jimmy would not meet him; he
would be too ashamed of himself, which showed how gullible poor
Johnnie still was.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when he was well away from White's selection,
Jimmy suddenly and mysteriously appeared on the road after the
fashion of a blackfellow.</p>

<p>'I'm hungry; you got fill out; I got nothing only charge of
shot.'</p>

<p>'A charge of fright, Jimmy; you were too far away to get
hurt.'</p>

<p>'Well, gib it cake.' Johnnie was not hungry, and he gave him
the cake.</p>

<p>'Jimmy, I am afraid that you are a coward and a thief.'</p>

<p>'Oh! so you do? Well, now, I just show you,' and before
Johnnie knew what be was up to, he had grasped the gun, and
dragged it out of his hands.</p>

<p>'You just come alonga your father. He be anxious about you.
Hurry up, no cheek!'</p>

<p>Johnnie was too astounded at this sudden change of front to
make any show of resistance, even if he had any chance, for Jimmy
was twice the size of poor little Johnnie. He accordingly went;
but was unprepared for the sequel.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they arrived at the station,
and Johnnie was tired after roaming about all day. His father was
standing on the verandah when they came up, and before Mr.
Murchison or Johnnie could speak Jimmy burst out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here's Johnnie, Mitter Murchison. I bin find him long way,
going out with gun to be a bushranger. I make him come home. Very
hungry and tired me. You gib it rations and shirt. Johnnie fired
at me, and put shot in shirt,' and he turned round to show the
perforation. Johnnie was speechless with indignation.</p>

<p>'It was Mr. White who fired at him because he was a thief!' he
got out; but his father stopped him.</p>

<p>'Go inside! I will listen to you presently,' and poor Johnnie
had to obey orders, and leave that arch conspirator Jimmy to
tell his story uncontradicted.</p>

<p>He had the additional mortification of hearing his father go
down to the store to give Jimmy rations and a new shirt.</p>

<p>Next time Johnnie goes bushranging he will choose a different
mate to King Jimmy.</p>
