  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p>THE story of Margaret of Anjou forms a part of the history of England, for
  the lady, though of Continental origin, was the queen of one of the English
  kings, and England was the scene of her most remarkable adventures and
  exploits. She lived in very stormy times, and led a very stormy life; and her
  history, besides the interest which it excites from the extraordinary
  personal and political vicissitudes which it records, is also useful in
  throwing a great deal of light upon the ideas of right and wrong, and of good
  and evil, and upon the manners and customs, both of peace and war, which
  prevailed in England during the age of chivalry.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE HOUSES OF YORK AND LANCASTER</h2>

  <p class="first">MARGARET OF ANJOU was a heroine; not a heroine of romance
  and fiction, but of stern and terrible reality. Her life was a series of
  military exploits, attended with dangers, privations, sufferings, and
  wonderful vicissitudes of fortune, scarcely to be paralleled in the whole
  history of mankind.</p>

  <p>She was born and lived in a period during which there prevailed in the
  western part of Europe two great and dreadful quarrels, which lasted for more
  than a hundred years, and which kept France and England, and all the
  countries contiguous to them, in a state of continual commotion during all
  that time.</p>

  <p>The first of these quarrels grew out of a dispute which arose among the
  various branches of the royal family of England in respect to the succession
  to the crown. The two principal branches of the family were the descendants
  respectively of the Dukes of York and Lancaster, and the wars which they
  waged against each other are called in history the wars of the houses of York
  and Lancaster. These wars continued for several successive generations, and
  Margaret of Anjou was the queen of one of the most prominent representatives
  of the Lancaster line. Thus she became most intimately involved in the
  quarrel.</p>

  <p>The second great contention which prevailed during this period consisted
  of the wars waged between France and England for the possession of the
  territory which now forms the northern portion of France. A large portion of
  that territory, during the reigns that immediately preceded the time of
  Margaret of Anjou, had belonged to England. But the kings of France were
  continually attempting to regain possession of it&mdash;the English, of
  course, all the time making desperate resistance. Thus, for a hundred years,
  including the time while Margaret lived, England was involved in a double set
  of wars&mdash;the one internal, being waged by one branch of the royal family
  against the other for the possession of the throne, and the other external,
  being waged against France and other Continental powers for the possession of
  the towns and castles, and the country dependent upon them, which lay along
  the southern shore of the English Channel.</p>

  <p>In order that the story of Margaret of Anjou may be properly understood,
  it will be necessary first to give some explanations in respect to the nature
  of these two quarrels, and to the progress which had been made in them up to
  the time when Margaret came upon the stage. We shall begin with the internal
  or civil wars which were waged between the families of York and Lancaster.
  Some account of the origin and nature of this difficulty is given in our
  history of Richard III., but it is necessary to allude to it again here, and
  to state some additional particulars in respect to it, on account of the very
  important part which Margaret of Anjou performed in the quarrel.</p>

  <p>The difficulty originated among the children and descendants of King
  Edward III. He reigned in the early part of the fourteenth century. He
  occupied the throne a long time, and his reign was considered very prosperous
  and glorious. The prosperity and glory of it consisted, in a great measure,
  in the success of the wars which he waged in France, and in the towns, and
  castles, and districts of country which he conquered there, and annexed to
  the English domain.</p>

  <p>In these wars old King Edward was assisted very much by the princes his
  sons, who were very warlike young men, and who were engaged from time to time
  in many victorious campaigns on the Continent. They began this career when
  they were very young, and they continued it through all the years of their
  manhood and middle life, for their father lived to an advanced age.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable of these warlike princes were Edward and John. Edward
  was the oldest son, and John the third in order of age of those who arrived
  at maturity. The name of the second was Lionel. Edward, the oldest son, was
  of course the Prince of Wales; but, to distinguish him from other Princes of
  Wales that preceded and followed him, he is known commonly in history by the
  name of the Black Prince. He received this name originally on account of
  something about his armor which was black, and which marked his appearance
  among the other knights on the field of battle.</p>

  <p>The Black Prince did not live to succeed his father and inherit the
  throne, for he lost his health in his campaigns on the Continent, and came
  home to England, and died a few years before his father died. His son, whose
  name was Richard, was his heir, and when at length old King Edward died, this
  young Richard succeeded to the crown, under the title of King Richard II. In
  the history of Richard II., in this series, a full account of the life of his
  father, the Black Prince, is given, and of the various remarkable adventures
  that he met with in his Continental campaigns.</p>

  <p>Prince John, the third of the sons of old King Edward, is commonly known
  in history as John of Gaunt. This word Gaunt was the nearest approach that
  the English people could make in those days to the pronunciation of the word
  Ghent, the name of the town where John was born. For King Edward, in the
  early part of his life, was accustomed to take all his family with him in his
  Continental campaigns, and so his several children were born in different
  places, one in one city and another in another, and many of them received
  names from the places where they happened to be born.</p>

    <p class="caption">Selecting the Roses</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>On the following page we have a genealogical table of the family of Edward
  III. At the head of it we have the names of Edward III. and Philippa his
  wife. In a line below are the names of those four of his sons whose
  descendants figure in English history. It was among the descendants of these
  sons that the celebrated wars between the houses of York and Lancaster,
  called the wars of the roses, arose.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401651h-images/Margaret-03.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>These wars were called the wars of the roses from the circumstance that
  the white and the red rose happened in some way to be chosen as the badges of
  the two parties&mdash;the white rose being that of the house of York, and the
  red that of the house of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>The reader will observe that the dukes of Lancaster and York are the third
  and fourth of the brothers enumerated in the table, where, as it might have
  been supposed that any contest which should have arisen in respect to the
  crown would have taken place between families of the first and second. But
  the first and second sons and their descendants were soon set aside, as it
  were, from the competition, in the following manner.</p>

  <p>The line of the first brother soon became extinct. Edward himself, the
  Prince of Wales, died during his father's lifetime, leaving his son Richard
  as his heir. Then, when the old king died, Richard succeeded him. As he was
  the oldest living son of the oldest son, his claim could not be disputed, and
  so his uncles acquiesced in it. They wished very much, it is true, to govern
  the realm, but they contented themselves with ruling in Richard's name until
  he became of age, and then Richard took the government into his own hands.
  The country was tolerably well satisfied under his dominion for some years,
  but at length Richard became dissipated and vicious, and he domineered over
  the people of England in so haughty a manner, and oppressed them so severely
  by the taxes and other exactions which he laid upon them, that a very general
  discontent prevailed at last against him and against his government. This
  discontent would have given either of his uncles a great advantage in any
  design which they might have formed to take away the crown from him. As it
  was, it greatly increased their power and influence in the land, and
  diminished, in a corresponding degree, that of the king. The uncles appear to
  have been contented with this share of power and influence, which seemed
  naturally to fall into their hands, and did not attempt any open
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>Richard had a cousin, however, a young man of just about his own age, who
  was driven at last, by a peculiar train of circumstances, to rise against
  him. This cousin was the son of his uncle John. His name was Henry
  Bolingbroke. He appears in the genealogical table as Henry IV., that having
  been his title subsequently as King of England.</p>

  <p>This cousin Henry became involved in a quarrel with a certain nobleman
  named Norfolk. Indeed, the nobles of those days were continually getting
  engaged in feuds and quarrels, which they fought out with the greatest
  recklessness, sometimes by regular battles between armies of retainers, and
  sometimes by single combat, in which the parties to the dispute were supposed
  to appeal to Almighty God, who they believed, or professed to believe, would
  give the victory to the just side in the quarrel. These single combats were
  arranged with great ceremony and parade, and were performed in a very public
  and solemn manner; being, in fact, a recognized and established part of the
  system of public law as administered in those days. In the next chapter, when
  speaking more particularly of the manners and customs of the times, I shall
  give an account in full of one of these duels. I have only to say here that
  Richard, on hearing of the quarrel between his cousin Henry and Norfolk,
  decreed that they should settle it by single combat, and preparations were
  accordingly made for the trial, and the parties appeared, armed and equipped
  for the fight, in the presence of an immense concourse of people assembled to
  witness the spectacle. The king himself was to preside on the occasion.</p>

  <p>But just before the signal was to be given for the combat to begin, the
  king interrupted the proceedings, and declared that he would decide the
  question himself. He pronounced both the combatants guilty, and issued a
  decree of banishment against both. Henry submitted, and both prepared to
  leave the country. These transactions, of course, attracted great attention
  throughout England, and they operated to bring Henry forward in a very
  conspicuous manner before the people of the realm. He was in the direct line
  of succession to the crown, and he was, moreover, a prince of great wealth,
  and of immense personal influence, and so, just in proportion as Richard
  himself was disliked, Henry would naturally become an object of popular
  sympathy and regard. When he set out on his journey toward the southern
  coast, in order to leave the country in pursuance of his sentence, the people
  flocked along the waysides, and assembled in the towns where he passed, as if
  he were a conqueror returning from his victories instead of a condemned
  criminal going into banishment.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, the Duke of Lancaster, Henry's father, died, and then
  Richard, instead of allowing his cousin to succeed to the immense estates
  which his father left, confiscated all the property, under the pretext that
  Henry had forfeited it, and so converted it to his own use. This last outrage
  aroused Henry to such a pitch of indignation that he resolved to invade
  England, depose Richard, and claim the crown for himself.</p>

  <p>This plan was carried into effect. Henry raised an armament, crossed the
  Channel, and landed in England. The people took sides. A great majority sided
  with Henry. A full account of this insurrection and invasion is given in our
  history of Richard II. All that it is necessary to say here is that the
  revolution was effected. Richard was deposed, and Henry obtained possession
  of the kingdom. It was thus that the house of Lancaster first became
  established on the throne.</p>

  <p>But you will very naturally wonder where the representatives of the second
  brother in Edward the Third's family were all this time, and why, when
  Richard was deposed, who was the son of the first brother, they did not
  appear, and advance their claims in competition with Henry. The reason was
  because there was no male heir of that branch living in that line. You will
  see by referring again to the table that the only child of Lionel, the second
  brother, was Philippa, a girl. She had a son, it is true, Roger Mortimer, as
  appears by the table; but he was yet very young, and could do nothing to
  assert the claims of his line. Besides, Henry pretended that, together with
  his claims to the throne through his father, he had others more ancient and
  better founded still through his mother, who, as he attempted to prove, was
  descended from an English king who reigned before Edward III. The people of
  England, as they wished to have Henry for king, were very easily satisfied
  with his arguments, and so it was settled that he should reign. The line of
  this second brother, however, did not give up their claims, but reserved
  them, intending to rise and assert them on the very first favorable
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>Henry reigned about thirteen years, and then was succeeded by his son,
  Henry V., as appears by the table. There was no attempt to disturb the
  Lancastrian line in their possession of the throne during these two reigns.
  The attention, both of the kings and of the people, during all this period,
  was almost wholly engrossed in the wars which they were waging in France.
  These wars were very successful. The English conquered province after
  province and castle after castle, until at length almost the whole country
  was brought under their sway.</p>

  <p>This state of things continued until the death of Henry V., which took
  place in 1422. He left for his heir a little son, named also Henry, then only
  about nine months old. This infant was at once invested with the royal
  authority as King of England and France, under the title of Henry VI., as
  seen by the table. It was this Henry who, when he arrived at maturity, became
  the husband of Margaret of Anjou, the subject of this volume. It was during
  his reign, too, that the first effective attempt was made to dispute the
  right of the house of Lancaster to the throne, and it was in the terrible
  contests which this attempt brought on that Margaret displayed the
  extraordinary military heroism for which she became so renowned. I shall
  relate the early history of this king, and explain the nature of the
  combination which was formed during his reign against the Lancastrian line,
  in a subsequent chapter, after first giving a brief account of such of the
  manners and customs of those times as are necessary to a proper understanding
  of the story.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE TIME</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the days when Margaret of Anjou lived, the kings,
  princes, nobles, and knights who flourished in the realms of England and
  France, though they were, relatively to the mass of the people, far more
  wealthy, proud, and powerful than their successors are at the present day,
  still lived in many respects in a very rude and barbarous manner. They
  enjoyed very few of the benefits and privileges which all classes enjoy in
  the age in which we live. They had very few books, and very little advantage
  of instruction to enable them to read those that they had. There were no good
  roads by which they could travel comfortably from place to place, and no
  wheeled carriages. They lived in castles, very strongly built indeed, and
  very grand and picturesque sometimes in external appearance, but very illy
  furnished and comfortless within. The artisans were skillful in fabricating
  splendid caparisons for the horses, and costly suits of glittering armor for
  the men, and the architects could construct grand cathedrals, and ornament
  them with sculptures and columns which are the wonder of the present age. But
  in respect to all the ordinary means and appliances of daily life, even the
  most wealthy and powerful nobles lived in a very barbarous way.</p>

  <p>The mass of the common people were held in a state of abject submission to
  the will of the chieftains, very much in the condition of slaves, being
  compelled to toil in the cultivation of their masters' lands, or to go out as
  soldiers to fight in their quarrels, without receiving any compensation. The
  great ambition of every noble and knight was to have as many of these
  retainers as possible under his command. The only limit to the number which
  each chieftain could assemble was his power of feeding them. For in those
  days men could be more easily found to fight than to engage in any other
  employment, and there were great numbers always ready to follow any commander
  who was able to maintain them.</p>

  <p>Each great noble lived in state in his castle, like a prince or a petty
  king. Those of the highest class had their privy councilors, treasurers,
  marshals, constables, stewards, secretaries, heralds, pursuivants, pages,
  guards, trumpeters&mdash;in short, all the various officers that were to be
  found in the court of the sovereign. To these were added whole bands of
  minstrels, mimics, jugglers, tumblers, rope-dancers, and buffoons. Besides
  these, there was always attached to great each castle a large company of
  priests and monks, who performed divine service according to the usages of
  those times, in a gorgeously-decorated chapel built for this purpose within
  the castle walls.</p>

  <p>Thus the whole country was divided, as it were, into a vast number of
  separate jurisdictions, each with an earl, or a baron, or a duke at the head
  of it, who ruled with an almost absolute sway in every thing that related to
  the internal management of his province, while however, he recognized a
  certain general dominion over all on the part of the king. Such being the
  state of the case, it is not surprising that the nobles were often powerful
  enough, as will course of this narrative, to band together and set up and put
  down kings at their pleasure.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most powerful of all the great nobles who flourished during
  the time of Margaret of Anjou was the Earl of Warwick. So great was his
  influence in deciding between the rival claims of different pretenders to the
  crown, that he is known in history by the title of the King-maker. His wealth
  was so enormous that it was said that the body of retainers that he
  maintained amounted sometimes in number to thirty thousand men.</p>

  <p>The employments, and even the amusements of these great barons and nobles,
  were all military. They looked down with great disdain upon all the useful
  pursuits of art and industry, regarding them as only fit occupations for
  serfs and slaves. Their business was going to war, either independently
  against each other, or, under the command of the king, against some common
  enemy. When they were not engaged in any of these wars they amused themselves
  and the people of their courts with tournaments, and mock combats and
  encounters of all kinds, which they arranged in open grounds contiguous to
  their castles with great pomp and parade.</p>

  <p>It could not be expected that such powerful and warlike chieftains as
  these could be kept much under the control of law by the ordinary machinery
  of courts of justice. There were, of course, laws and courts of justice in
  those days, but they were administered chiefly upon the common people, for
  the repression of common crimes. The nobles, in their quarrels and
  contentions with each other, were accustomed to settle the questions that
  arose in other ways. Sometimes they did this by marshaling their troops and
  fighting each other in regular campaigns, during which they laid siege to
  castles, and ravaged villages and fields, as in times of public war.
  Sometimes, when the power of the king was sufficient to prevent such
  out-breaks as these, the parties to the quarrel were summoned to settle the
  dispute by single combat in the presence of the king and his court, as well
  as of a vast multitude of assembled spectators. These single combats were the
  origin of the modern custom of dueling.</p>

  <p>At the present day, the settlement of disputes by a private combat between
  the parties to it is made a crime by the laws of the land. It is justly
  considered a barbarous and sense-less practice. The man who provokes another
  to a duel and then kills him in the fight, instead of acquiring any glory by
  the deed, has to bear, for the rest of his life, both in his own conscience
  and in the opinion of mankind, the mark and stain of murder. And when, in
  defiance of law, and of the opinions and wishes of all good men, any two
  disputants who have become involved in a quarrel are rendered so desperate by
  their angry passions as to desire to satisfy them by this mode, they are
  obliged to resort to all sorts of manoeuvres and stratagems to conceal the
  crime which they are about to commit, and to avoid the interference of their
  friends or of the officers of the law.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ordeal Combat</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>In the days, however, of the semi-savage knights and barons who flourished
  so luxuriantly in the times of which we are writing, the settlement of a
  dispute by single combat between the two parties to it was an openly
  recognized and perfectly legitimate mode of arbitration, and the trial of the
  question was conducted with forms and ceremonies even more strict and more
  solemn than those which governed the proceedings in regular courts of
  justice.</p>

  <p>The engraving on the preceding page is a sort of rude emblematic
  representation of such a trial, copied from a drawing in an ancient
  manuscript. We see the combatants in the foreground, with the judges and
  spectators behind.</p>

  <p>It was to a public and solemn combat of this kind that Richard the Second
  summoned his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, and his enemy, as related in the last
  chapter. In that instance the combat was not fought, the king having taken
  the case into his own hands, and condemned both the parties before the
  contest was begun. But in multitudes of other cases the trial was carried
  through to its consummation in the death of one party, and the triumph and
  acquittal of the other.</p>

  <p>Very many detailed and full accounts of these combats have come down to us
  in the writings of the ancient chroniclers. I will here give a description of
  one of them, as an example of this mode of trial, which was fought in the
  public square in front of King Richard the Second's palace, the king himself,
  all the principal nobles of the court, and a great crowd of other persons
  being provided with seats around the area as spectators of the fight. The
  nobles and knights were all dressed in complete armor; and heralds, and
  squires, and guards were stationed in great numbers to regulate the
  proceedings. It was on a bright morning in June when the combat was fought,
  and the whole aspect of the scene was that of a grand and joyful spectacle on
  a gala day.</p>

  <p>It was estimated that more people from the surrounding country came to
  London on the occasion of this duel than at the time of the coronation of the
  king. It took place about three years after the coronation.</p>

  <p>The parties to the combat were John Anneslie, a knight, and Thomas
  Katrington, a squire. Anneslie, the knight, was the complainant and the
  challenger. Katrington, the squire, was the defendant. The circumstances of
  the case were as follows.</p>

  <p>Katrington, the squire, was governor of a castle in Normandy. The castle
  belonged to a certain English knight who afterward died, and his estate
  descended to Anneslie, the complainant in this quarrel. If the squire had
  successfully defended the castle from the French who attacked it, then it
  would have descended with the other property to Anneslie. But he did not.
  When the French came and laid siege to the castle, Katrington surrendered it,
  and so it was lost. He maintained that he had not a sufficient force to
  defend it, and that he had no alternative but to surrender. Anneslie, on the
  other hand, alleged that he might have defended it, and that be would have
  done so if he had been faithful to his trust; but that he had been bribed by
  the French to give it up. This Katrington denied; so Anneslie, who was very
  angry at the loss of the castle, challenged him to single combat to try the
  question.</p>

  <p>It is plain that this was a very absurd way of attempting to ascertain
  whether Katrington had or had not been bribed; but, as the affair had
  occurred some years before, and in another country, and as, moreover, the
  giving and receiving of bribes are facts always very difficult to be proved
  by ordinary evidence, it was decided by the government of the king that this
  was a proper case for the trial by combat, and both parties were ordered to
  prepare for the fight. The day, too, was fixed, and the place&mdash;the
  public square opposite the king's palace&mdash;was appointed. As the time
  drew nigh, the whole country for many miles around was excited to the highest
  pitch of interest and expectation.</p>

  <p>At the place where the combat was to be fought a large space was railed in
  by a very substantial barricade. The barricade was made very strong, so as to
  resist the utmost possible pressure of the crowd. Elevated seats, commanding
  a full view of the lists, as the area railed in was called, were erected for
  the use of the king and the nobles of the court, and all other necessary
  preparations were made. When the hour arrived on the appointed day, the king
  and the nobles came in great state and took their places. The whole square,
  with the exception of the lists and proper avenues of approach, which were
  kept open by the men-at-arms, had long since, been filled with an immense
  crowd of people from the surrounding country. At length, after a brief period
  of expectation, the challenger, Anneslie, was seen coming along one of the
  approaches, mounted on a horse splendidly caparisoned, and attended by
  several knights and squires, his friends, all completely armed.</p>

  <p>He stopped when he reached the railing and dismounted from his horse. It
  was against the laws of the combat for either party to enter the lists
  mounted. If a horse went within the inclosure he was forfeited by that act to
  a certain public officer called the high constable of England, who was
  responsible for the regularity and order of the proceedings.</p>

  <p>Anneslie, having thus dismounted from his horse with the assistance of his
  attendants, walked into the lists all armed and equipped for the fight. His
  squires attended him. He walked there to and fro a few minutes, and then a
  herald, blowing a trumpet, summoned the accused to appear.</p>

  <p>"Thomas Katrington! Thomas Katrington!" he cried out in a loud voice,
  "come and appear, to save the action for which Sir John Anneslie, knight,
  hath publicly and by writing appealed thee!"</p>

  <p>Three times the herald proclaimed this summons, At the third time
  Katrington appeared.</p>

  <p>He came, as Anneslie had come, mounted upon a war-horse splendidly
  caparisoned, and with his arms embroidered on the trappings. He was attended
  by his friends, the representatives of the seconds of the modern duel. The
  two stopped at the entrance of the lists, and dismounting, passed into the
  lists on foot. Every body being now intent on the combatants, the horse for
  the moment was let go, and, being eager to follow his master, he ran up and
  down along the railing, reaching his head and neck over as far as he could,
  and trying to get over. At length he was taken and led away; but the lord
  high constable said at once that he should claim him for having entered the
  lists.</p>

  <p>"At least," said he, "I shall claim his head and neck, and as much of him
  as was over the railing."</p>

  <p>The combatants now stood confronting each other within the lists. A
  written document was produced, which had been prepared, as was said, by
  consent of both parties, containing a statement of the charge made against
  Katrington, namely, that of treason, in having betrayed to the enemy for
  money a castle intrusted to his charge, and his reply. The herald read this
  document with a loud voice, in order that all the assembly, or as many as
  possible, might hear it. As soon as it was read, Katrington began to take
  exceptions to some passages in it. The Duke of Lancaster, who seemed to
  preside on the occasion, put an end to his criticisms at once, saying that he
  had already agreed to the paper, and that now, if he made any difficulty
  about it, and refused to fight, he should be adjudged guilty of the treason,
  and should at once be led out to execution.</p>

  <p>Katrington then said that he was ready to fight his antagonist, not only
  on the points raised in the document which had been read, but on any and all
  other points whatever that might be laid to his charge. He had entire
  confidence, he said, that the justice of his cause would secure him the
  victory.</p>

  <p>The next proceeding in this strange ceremony was singular enough. It was
  the solemn administering of an oath to each of the combatants, by which oath
  they severally swore that the cause in which they were to fight was true, and
  that they did not deal in any witchcraft or magic art, by which they expected
  to gain the victory over their adversary; and also, that they had not about
  their persons any herb or stone, or charm of any kind, by which they hoped to
  obtain any advantage.</p>

  <p>After this oath had been administered, time was allowed for the combatants
  to say their prayers. This ceremony they performed apparently in a very
  devout manner, and then the battle began.</p>

  <p>The combatants fought first with spears, then with swords, and finally,
  coming to very close quarters, with daggers. Anneslie seemed to gain the
  advantage. He succeeded in disarming Katrington of one after another of his
  weapons, and finally threw him down. When Katrington was down, Anneslie
  attempted to throw himself upon him, in order to crush him with the weight of
  his heavy iron armor. But he was exhausted by the heat and by the exertion
  which he had made, and the perspiration running down from his forehead under
  his helmet blinded his eyes, so that he could not see exactly where
  Katrington was, and, instead of falling upon him, he came down upon the
  ground at a little distance away. Katrington then contrived to make his way
  to Anneslie and to get upon him, thus pressing him down to the ground with
  his weight. The combatants lay thus a few minutes locked together on the
  ground, and struggling with each other as well as their heavy and cumbrous
  armor would permit, Katrington being all the time uppermost, when the king at
  length gave orders that the contest should cease and that the men should be
  separated.</p>

  <p>In obedience to these orders, some men came to rescue Anneslie by taking
  Katrington off from him. But Anneslie begged them not to interfere. And when
  the men had taken Katrington off, he urged them to place him back upon him
  again as he was before, for he said he himself was not hurt at all, and he
  had no doubt that he should gain the victory if they would leave him alone.
  The men, however, having the king's order for what they were doing, paid no
  heed to Anneslie's requests, but proceeded to lead Katrington away.</p>

  <p>They found that he was so weak and exhausted that he could not stand. They
  led him to a chair, and then; taking off his helmet, they tried to revive him
  by bathing his face and giving him some wine.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, Anneslie, finding that Katrington was taken away,
  allowed himself to be lifted up. When set upon his feet, he walked along
  toward the part of the inclosure which was near the king's seat, and begged
  the king to allow the combat to proceed. He said he was sure that he should
  obtain the victory if they would but permit him to continue the combat to the
  end. Finally the king and nobles gave their consent, and ordered that
  Anneslie should be placed upon the ground again, and Katrington upon him, in
  the same position, as nearly as possible, as before.</p>

  <p>But on going again to Katrington with a view of executing this decree,
  they found that he was in such a condition as to preclude the possibility of
  it. He had fainted and fallen down out of his chair in a deadly swoon. He
  seemed not to be wounded, but to be utterly exhausted by the heat, the weight
  of his armor, and the extreme violence of the exertion which he had made. His
  friends raised him up again, and proceeded to unbuckle and take off his
  armor. Relieved from this burden, he began to come to himself. He opened his
  eyes and looked around, staring with a wild, bewildered, and ghastly look,
  which moved the pity of all the beholders, that is, of all but Anneslie. He,
  on leaving the king, came to where poor Katrington was sitting, and, full of
  rage and hate, began to taunt and revile him, calling him traitor, and false,
  perjured villain, and daring him to come out again into the area and finish
  the fight.</p>

  <p>To this Katrington made no answer, but stared wildly about with a crazed
  look, as if he did not know where he was or what they were doing to him.</p>

  <p>So the farther prosecution of the combat was relinquished. Anneslie was
  declared the victor, and poor Katrington was deemed to be proved, by his
  defeat, guilty of the treason which had been charged against him. He was
  borne away by his friends, and put into his bed. He continued delirious all
  that night, and the next morning at nine o'clock he died.</p>

  <p>Thus was this combat fought, as the ancient historian says, to the great
  rejoicing of the common people and the discouragement of traitors!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; KING HENRY VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">KING HENRY THE SIXTH, who subsequently became the husband of
  Margaret of Anjou, was only about nine months old, as has already been said,
  when he succeeded to the throne by the death of his father. He was proclaimed
  by the heralds to the sound of trumpets and drums, in all parts of London,
  while he was yet an infant in his nurse's arms.</p>

  <p>Of course the question was now who should have the rule in England while
  Henry remained a child. And this question chiefly affected the little king's
  uncles, of whom there were three&mdash;all rude, turbulent, and powerful
  nobles, such as were briefly described in the last chapter. Each of them had
  a powerful band of retainers and partisans attached to his service, and the
  whole kingdom dreaded greatly the quarrels which every one knew were now
  likely to break out.</p>

  <p>The oldest of these uncles was Thomas. He was Duke of Exeter.</p>

  <p>The second was John. He was Duke of Bedford. The third was Humphrey. He
  was Duke of Gloucester. Thomas and Humphrey seem to have been in England at
  the time of their brother the old king's death. John, or Bedford, as he was
  commonly called, was in France, where he had been pursuing a very renowned
  and successful career, in extending and maintaining the English conquests in
  that country.</p>

  <p>The leading nobles and officers of the government were assembled in
  council soon after the old king's death, and in order to prevent the breaking
  out of the quarrels which were otherwise to have been anticipated between
  these uncles, they determined to divide the power as nearly as possible in an
  equal manner among them. So they appointed Thomas, the Duke of Exeter, who
  seems to have been less ambitious and warlike in his character than the rest,
  to the charge and custody of the young king's person. Humphrey, the Duke of
  Gloucester, was made Protector of England, and John, the Duke of Bedford, the
  Regent of France. Thus they were all seemingly satisfied.</p>

  <p>But the peace which resulted from this arrangement did not continue very
  long. Pretty soon a certain Henry Beaufort, a bishop, was appointed to be
  associated with Henry's uncle Thomas in the personal charge of the king. This
  Henry Beaufort was Henry's great-uncle, being one of the sons of John of
  Gaunt. He was a younger son of his father, and so was brought up to the
  Church, and had been appointed Bishop of Winchester, and afterward made a
  cardinal. Thus he occupied a very exalted position, and possessed a degree of
  wealth, and power, and general consequence little inferior to those of the
  grandest nobles in the land. He was a man, too, of great capacity, very
  skillful in manoeuvring and intriguing, and he immediately began to form
  ambitious schemes for himself which he designed to carry into effect through
  the power which the custody of the young king gave him. He was, of course,
  very jealous of the influence and power of the Duke of Gloucester, and the
  Duke of Gloucester became very jealous of him. It was not long before
  occasions arose which brought the two men, and their bands of followers, into
  direct and open collision.</p>

  <p>I can not here go into a full account of the particulars of the quarrel.
  One of the first difficulties was about the Tower of London, which Beaufort
  had under his command, and where there was a prisoner whom Gloucester wished
  to set at liberty. Then there was a great riot and disturbance on London
  Bridge, which threw the whole city of London into a state of alarm. Beaufort
  alleged that Gloucester had formed a plan to seize the person of the king and
  tale him away from Beaufort's custody; and that he had designs, moreover, on
  Beaufort's life. To defend himself and, to prevent Gloucester from coming to
  the palace where he was residing, he seized and fortified the passages
  leading to the bridge. He built barricades, and took down the chains of the
  portcullis, and assembled a large armed force to guard the point. The people
  of London were in great alarm. They set watches day and night to protect
  their property from the anticipated violence of the soldiers and partisans of
  the combatants, and thus all was commotion and fear. Of course there were no
  courts of justice powerful enough to control such a contest as this, and
  finally the people sent off a delegation to the Duke of Bedford in France,
  imploring him to come to England immediately and see if he could not settle
  the quarrel.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Bedford came. A Parliament was convened, and the questions at
  issue between the two great disputants were brought to a solemn trial. The
  Duke of Gloucester made out a series of heavy charges against the cardinal,
  and the cardinal made a formal reply which contained not only his defense,
  but also counter charges against the duke. These papers were drawn up with
  great technicality and ceremony by the lawyers employed on each side to
  manage the case, and were submitted to the Duke of Bedford and to the
  Parliament. A series of debates ensued, in which the friends of the two
  parties respectively brought criminations and recriminations against each
  other without end. The result was, as is usual in such cases, that both sides
  appeared to have been to blame, and in order to settle the dispute a sort of
  compromise was effected, with which both parties professed to be satisfied,
  and a reconciliation, or what outwardly appeared to be such, was made. A new
  division of powers and prerogatives between Gloucester, as Protector of
  England, and Beaufort, as custodian of the king, was arranged, and peace
  being thus restored, Bedford went back again to France.</p>

  <p>Things went on tolerably well after this for many years; that is, there
  were no more open outbreaks, though the old jealousy and hatred between
  Gloucester and the cardinal still continued. The influence of the Duke of
  Bedford held both parties in check as long as the duke lived. At length,
  however, when the young king was about fourteen years old, the Duke of
  Bedford died. He was in France at the time of his death. He was buried with
  great pomp and ceremony in the city of Rouen, which had been in some sense
  the head-quarters of his dominion in that country, and a splendid monument
  was erected over his tomb:</p>

  <p>A curious anecdote is related of the King of France in relation to this
  tomb. Some time after the tomb was built Rouen fell into the hands of the
  French, and some persons proposed to break down the monument which had been
  built in memory of their old enemy; but the King of France would not listen
  to the proposal.</p>

  <p>"What honor shall it be to us," said he, "or to you, to break down the
  monument, or to pull out of the ground the dead bones of him whom, in his
  life, neither my father nor your progenitors, with all their power,
  influence, and friends, were ever able to make flee one foot backward, but
  who, by his strength, wit, and policy, kept them all at bay. Wherefore I say,
  let God have his soul; and for his body, let it rest in peace where they have
  laid it."</p>

  <p>When King Henry was old enough to be crowned, in addition to the English
  part of the ceremony, he went to France to receive the crown of that country
  too. The ceremony, as is usual with the French kings, was performed at the
  town of St. Denis, near Paris, where is an ancient royal chapel, in which all
  the great religious ceremonies connected with the French monarchy have been
  performed. A very curious account is given by the ancient chroniclers of the
  pageants and ceremonies which were enacted on this occasion. The king
  proceeded into France and journeyed to St. Denis at the head of a grand
  cavalcade of knights, nobles, and men-at-arms, amounting to many thousand
  men, all of whom were adorned with dresses and trappings of the most gorgeous
  description. At St. Denis the authorities came out to meet the king, dressed
  in robes of vermilion, and bearing splendid banners. The king was presented,
  as he passed through the gates, "with three crimson hearts, in one of which
  were two doves; in another, several small birds, which were let fly over his
  head; while the third was filled with violets and flowers, which were thrown
  over the lords that attended and followed him."</p>

  <p>At the same place, too, a company of the principal civic dignitaries of
  the town appeared, bearing a gorgeous canopy of blue silk, adorned and
  embroidered in the most beautiful manner with royal emblems. This canopy they
  held over the king as he advanced into the town.</p>

  <p>At one place farther on, where there was a little bridge to be crossed,
  there was a pageant of three savages fighting about a woman in a mimic
  forest. The savages continued fighting until the king had passed by. Next
  came a fountain flowing with wine, with mermaids swimming about in it. The
  wine in this fountain was free to all who chose to come and drink it.</p>

  <p>Then, farther still, the royal party came to a place where an artificial
  forest had been made, by some means or other, in a large, open square. There
  was a chase going on in this forest at the time when the king went by. The
  chase consisted of a living stag hunted by real dogs. The stag came and took
  refuge at the feet of the king's horse, and his majesty saved the poor
  animal's life.</p>

  <p>Thus the king was conducted to his palace. Several days were spent in
  preliminary pageants and ceremonies like the above, and then the coronation
  took place in the church, the king and his party being stationed on a large
  platform raised for the purpose in the most conspicuous part of the
  edifice.</p>

  <p>After the coronation there was a grand banquet, at which the king, with
  his lords and great officers of state, sat at a marble table in a magnificent
  ancient hall. Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester, was the principal
  personage in all these ceremonies next to the king. Gloucester was very
  jealous of him, in respect to the conspicuous part which he took in these
  proceedings.</p>

    <p class="caption">Henry VI. in his Youth</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Henry was quite young at the time of his coronations. He was a very pretty
  boy, and his countenance wore a mild and gentle expression.</p>

  <p>The quarrel between the Duke of Gloucester and the bishop was kept, in
  some degree, subdued during this period, partly by the influence of the Duke
  of Bedford while he lived, and partly by Gloucester's mind being taken up to
  a considerable extent with other things, especially with his campaigns in
  France; for he was engaged during the period of the king's minority in many
  important military expeditions in that country. At length, however, he came
  back to England, and there, when the king was about twenty years of age, the
  quarrel between him and the bishop's party broke out anew. The king himself
  was, however, now old enough to take some part in such a difficulty, and so
  both sides appealed to him. Gloucester made out a series of twenty-four
  articles of complaint against the bishop. The bishop, on the other hand,
  accused the duke of treason, and he specially charged that his wife had
  attempted to destroy the life of the king by witchcraft. The duchess was
  condemned on this charge, and it is said that, by way of penance, she was
  sentenced to walk barefoot through the most public street in London with a
  lighted taper in her hand. Some other persons, who were accused of being
  accomplices in this crime, were put to death.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The Penance</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The witchcraft which it was said these persons practiced was that of
  making a waxen image of the king, and then, after connecting it with him in
  some mysterious and magical way by certain charms and incantations, melting
  it away by degrees before a slow fire, by which means the king himself, as
  was supposed, would be caused to pine and wither away, and at last to die. It
  was universally believed in those days that this could be done.</p>

  <p>Of course, such proceedings as these only embittered the quarrel more and
  more, and Gloucester became more resolute and determined than ever in
  prosecuting his intrigues for depriving the bishop of influence, and for
  getting the power into his own hands. The king, though he favored the
  cardinal, was so quiet and gentle in his disposition, and so little disposed
  to take an active part in such a quarrel, that the bishop could not induce
  him to act as decidedly as he wished. So he finally conceived the idea of
  finding some very intelligent and capable princess as a wife for the king,
  hoping to increase the power which he exercised in the realm through his
  influence over her.</p>

  <p>The lady that he selected for this purpose was Margaret of Anjou.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; MARGARET'S FATHER AND MOTHER</h2>

  <p class="first">IN former times, the territory which now constitutes France
  was divided into a great number of separate provinces, each of which formed
  almost a distinct state or kingdom. These several provinces were the
  possessions of lords, dukes, and barons, who ruled over them, respectively,
  like so many petty kings, with almost absolute sway, though they all
  acknowledged a general allegiance to the kings of France or of England. The
  more northern provinces pertained to England. Those in the interior and
  southern portions of the country were under the dominion of France.</p>

  <p>The great families who held these provinces as their possessions ruled
  over them in a very lordly manner. They regarded not only the territory
  itself which they held, but the right to govern the inhabitants of it as a
  species of property, which was subject, like any other estate, to descend
  from parent to child by hereditary right, to be conveyed to another owner by
  treaty or surrender, to be assigned to a bride as her marriage portion, or to
  be disposed of in any other way that the lordly proprietors might prefer.
  These great families took their names from the provinces over which they
  ruled.</p>

  <p>One of these provinces was Anjou. The father of Margaret, the subject of
  this history, was a celebrated personage named Regnier or Ren, commonly
  called King Ren. He was a younger son of the family which reigned over
  Anjou. It is from this circumstance that our heroine derives the name by
  which she is generally designated&mdash;Margaret of Anjou. The reason why her
  father was called King Ren will appear in the sequel.</p>

  <p>Another of the provinces of France above referred to was Lorraine.
  Lorraine was a large, and beautiful, and very valuable country, situated
  toward the eastern part of France. Anjou was considerably to the westward of
  it.</p>

  <p>The name of the Duke of Lorraine at this time was Charles. He had a
  daughter named Isabella. She was the heiress to all her father's possessions.
  She was a young lady of great beauty, of high spirit, of a very accomplished
  education, according to the ideas of those times. When Ren was about
  fourteen years old a match was arranged between him and Isabella, who was
  then only about ten. The marriage was celebrated with great parade, and the
  youthful pair went to reside at a palace called Pont  Mousson, in a grand
  castle which was given to Isabella by her father as a bridal gift at the time
  of her marriage. Here it was expected that they would live until the death of
  her father, when they were to come into possession of the whole province of
  Lorraine.</p>

  <p>In process of time, while living at this castle, Ren and Isabella had
  several children. Margaret was the fifth. She was born in 1429. Her birthday
  was March 23.</p>

  <p>The little infant was put under the charge of a family nurse named
  Theophanie. Theophanie was a long-tried and very faithful domestic. She was
  successively the nurse to all of Isabella's children, and the family became
  so much attached to her that when she died Ren caused a beautiful monument
  to be raised to her memory. This monument contained a sculptured image of
  Theophanie, with two of the children in her arms.</p>

  <p>Very soon after her birth Margaret was baptized with great pomp in the
  Cathedral in the town of Toul. A large number of relatives of high rank
  witnessed and took part in the ceremony.</p>

  <p>When at length Charles, Duke of Lorraine, Isabella's father, died, and the
  province should have descended to Isabella and Ren, there suddenly appeared
  another claimant, who thought, not that he had a better right to the province
  than Isabella, but that he had more power to seize and hold it than she, even
  with all the aid that her husband Ren could afford her. This claimant was
  Isabella's uncle, the younger brother of Duke Charles who had just died. His
  name was Antoine de Vaudemonte, or, as it would be expressed in English,
  Anthony of Vaudemont. This uncle, on the death of Isabella's father,
  determined to seize the duchy for himself, instead of allowing it to descend
  to Isabella, the proper heir, who, being but a woman, was looked upon with
  very little respect. "Lorraine," he said, "was too noble and valuable a fief
  to descend in the family on the spindle side."</p>

  <p>So he collected his adherents and retainers, organized an army, and took
  the field. Isabella, on the other hand, did all in her power to induce the
  people of the country to espouse her cause. Ren took the command of the
  forces which were raised in her behalf, and went forth to meet Antoine.
  Isabella herself, taking the children with her, went to the city of Nancy
  &mdash;which was then, as now, the chief city of Lorraine, and was
  consequently the safest place for her&mdash;intending to await there the
  result of the conflict. Little Margaret was at this time about two years
  old.</p>

  <p>The battle was fought at a place called Bulgneville, and the fortune of
  war, as it would seem, turned in this case against the right, for Ren's
  party were entirely defeated, and he himself was wounded and taken prisoner.
  He fought like a lion, it is said, as long as he remained unharmed; but at
  last he received a desperate wound on his brow, and the blood from this wound
  ran down into his eyes and blinded him, so that he could do no more; and he
  was immediately seized by the men who had wounded him, and made prisoner. The
  person who thus wounded and captured him was the squire of a certain knight
  who had espoused the cause of Antoine, named the Count St. Pol.</p>

  <p>In the mean time Isabella had remained at Nancy with the children, in a
  state of the utmost suspense and anxiety, awaiting the result of a conflict
  on which depended the fate of every thing that was valuable and dear to her.
  At length, at the window of the tower where she was watching, with little
  Margaret in her arms, for the coming of a herald from her husband to announce
  his victory, her heart sank within her to see, instead of a messenger of joy
  and triumph, a broken crowd of fugitives, breathless and covered with dust
  and blood, suddenly bursting into view, and showing too plainly by their
  aspect of terror and distress that all was lost. Isabella was overwhelmed
  with consternation at the sight. She clasped little Margaret closely in her
  arms, exclaiming in tones of indescribable agony, "My husband is killed! my
  husband is killed!"</p>

  <p>Her distress and anguish were somewhat calmed by the fugitives assuring
  her, when they arrived, that her husband was safe, though he had been wounded
  and taken prisoner.</p>

    <p class="caption">Distress of Margaret's Mother</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>There was a great deal of sympathy felt for Isabella in her distress by
  all the people of Nancy. She was very young and very beautiful. Her children,
  and especially Margaret, were very beautiful too, and this greatly increased
  the compassion which the people were disposed to feel for her. Isabella's
  mother was strongly inclined to make new efforts to raise an army, in order
  to meet and fight Antoine again; but Isabella herself, who was now more
  concerned for the safety of her husband than for the recovery of her
  dominions, was disposed to pursue a conciliatory course. So she sent word to
  her uncle that she wished to see him, and entreated him to grant her an
  interview. Antoine acceded to her request, and at the interview Isabella
  begged her uncle to make peace with her, and to give her back her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Antoine said that it was out of his power to liberate Ren, for he had
  delivered him to the custody of the Duke of Burgundy, who had been his ally
  in the war, and the duke had conveyed him away to his castle at Dijon, and
  shut him up there, and that now he would probably not be willing to give him
  up without the payment of a ransom. He said, however, that he was willing to
  make a truce with Isabella for six months, to give time to see what
  arrangement could be made.</p>

  <p>This truce was agreed upon, and then, at length, after a long negotiation,
  terms of peace were concluded. Ren was to pay a large sum to the Duke of
  Burgundy for his ransom, and, in the mean time, while he was procuring the
  money, he was to leave his two sons in the duke's hands as hostages, to be
  held by the duke as security. In respect to Lorraine, Antoine insisted, as
  another of the conditions of peace, that Isabella's oldest daughter, Yolante,
  then about nine years old, should be betrothed to his son Frederick, so as to
  combine, in the next generation at least, the conflicting claims of the two
  parties to the possession of the territory; and, in order to secure the
  fulfillment of this condition, Yolante was to be delivered immediately to the
  charge and custody of Antoine's wife, the mother of her future husband. Thus
  all of Isabella's children were taken away from her except Margaret. And even
  Margaret, though left for the present with her mother, did not escape being
  involved in the entanglements of the treaty. Antoine insisted that she, too,
  should be betrothed to one of his partisans; and, as if to make the case as
  painful and humiliating to Ren and Isabella as possible, the person chosen
  to be her future husband was the very Count St. Pol whose squire had cut down
  and captured Ren at the battle of Bulgneville.</p>

  <p>These conditions were very hard, but Isabella consented to them, as it was
  only by so doing that any hope seemed to be opened before her of obtaining
  the release of her husband. And even this hope, in the end, proved delusive.
  Ren found that, notwithstanding all his efforts, he could not obtain the
  money which the duke required for his ransom. Accordingly, in order to save
  his boys, whom he had delivered to the duke as hostages, he was obliged to
  return to Dijon and surrender himself again a prisoner. His parting with his
  wife and children, before going a second time into a confinement to which
  they could now see no end, was heartrending. Even little Margaret, who was
  yet so very young, joined from sympathy in the general sorrow, and wept
  bitterly when her father went away.</p>

  <p>The duke confined his captive in an upper room in a high tower of the
  castle of Dijon, and kept him imprisoned there for several years. One of the
  boys was kept with him, but the other was set at liberty. All this time
  Margaret remained with her mother. She was a very beautiful and a very
  intelligent child, and was a great favorite with all who knew her. The
  interest which was awakened by her beauty and her other personal attractions
  was greatly increased by the general sympathy which was felt for the
  misfortunes of her father, and the loneliness and distress of her mother.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, Ren, shut up in the tower at the castle of Dijon, made
  himself as contented as he could, and employed his time in various peaceful
  and ingenious occupations. Though he had fought well in the battle with
  Antoine, he was, in fact, not at all of a warlike disposition. He was very
  fond of music, and poetry, and painting; and he occupied his leisure during
  his confinement in executing beautiful miniatures and paintings upon glass,
  after the manner of those times. Some of these paintings remained in the
  window of a church in Dijon, where they were placed soon after Ren painted
  them, for several hundred years.</p>

  <p>It has already been stated that the name by which Margaret's father is
  commonly designated is King Ren. The origin of this royal title is now to be
  explained. He had an older brother, who became by inheritance, with Joanna
  his wife, king and queen of the Two Sicilies, that is, of the kingdom
  consisting of the island of Sicily and the territory connected with Naples on
  the main land. The brother, at the close of his life, designated Ren as his
  heir. This happened in the year 1436, while Ren was still in captivity in
  the castle of Dijon. He could, of course, do nothing himself to assert his
  claims to this new inheritance, but Isabella immediately assumed the title of
  Queen of the Two Sicilies for herself, and began at once to make preparation
  for proceeding to Italy and taking possession of the kingdom.</p>

  <p>While maturing her plans, she took up her residence for a time at the
  chateau of Tarascon, on the banks of the Rhone, with the two children who
  remained under her care, namely, her son Louis and Margaret. Her other son
  was at Dijon with his father, and the other daughter, Yolante, had been given
  up, as has already been said, to the custody of the wife of Antoine, with a
  view of being married, as soon as she was old enough, to Antoine's son.</p>

  <p>The children attracted great, attention at Tarascon. Their mother Isabella
  was by birth a lady of very high rank, her family being intimately connected
  with the royal family of France. She was now, too, by title at least, herself
  a queen. The children were very intelligent and beautiful, and the
  misfortunes and cruel captivity of their father and brother were known and
  talked of in all the country around. So the peasants and their families
  crowded around the chateau to see the children. They brought them wreaths of
  flowers and other votive offerings. They sang songs to serenade them, and
  they built bonfires around the walls of the chateau at night, to drive away
  the infection of the plague, which was then prevailing in some parts of the
  country, and was exciting considerable alarm.</p>

  <p>The people of the country believed that this plague was produced by magic
  and witchcraft, and there were some poor old women, who came with the other
  peasants to the walls of the chateau of Tarascon to see the children, who
  were believed to be witches. Afterward the plague broke out at Tarascon, and
  Margaret's mother was obliged to go away, taking the children with her. The
  poor women were, however, seized and burned at the stake, it being
  universally believed that it was they who had caused the plague.</p>

  <p>Isabella's arrangements were now so far matured that she went at once into
  Italy with the children, and took up her abode there in the town of Capua.
  Ren still remained in captivity, but Isabella caused him to be proclaimed
  King of the Two Sicilies with great pomp and parade. At the time of this
  ceremony, the two children, Margaret and her brother, were seated beside
  their mother in a grand state carriage, which was lined with velvet and
  embroidered with gold, and in this way they were conveyed through the streets
  of the city.</p>

  <p>After a time Ren was liberated from his confinement, and restored to his
  family, but he did not long enjoy this apparent return of prosperity. His
  claim to the kingdom of Naples was disputed, and, after a conflict, he was
  expelled from the country. In the mean time, the English had so far extended
  their conquests in France that both his native province of Anjou, and his
  wife's inheritances in Lorraine, had fallen into their hands, so that with
  all the aristocratic distinction of their descent, and the grandeur of their
  royal titles, the family were now, as it were, without house or home. They
  returned to France, and Isabella, with the children, found refuge from time
  to time with one and another of the great families to which she was related,
  while Ren led a wandering life, being reduced often to a state of great
  destitution.</p>

  <p>He, however, bore his misfortunes with a very placid temper, and amused
  himself, wherever he was, with music, poetry, and painting. He was so
  cheerful and good-natured withal that he made himself a very agreeable
  companion, and was generally welcome, as a visitor, wherever he went. He
  retained the name of King Ren as long as he lived, though he was a king
  without a kingdom. At one time he was reduced, it is said, to such straits
  that to warm himself he used to walk to and fro in the streets of Marseilles,
  on the sunny side of the buildings, which circumstance gave rise to a proverb
  long known and often quoted in those parts, which designated the act of going
  out into the sun to escape from the cold as warming one's self at King Ren's
  fireside.</p>

  <p>Such was the family from which Margaret of Anjou sprung.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; ROYAL COURTSHIP</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Margaret was not more than fourteen or fifteen years of
  age, she began to be very celebrated for her beauty and accomplishments, and
  for the charming vivacity of her conversation and her demeanor. She resided
  with her mother in different families in Lorraine and in other parts of
  France, and was sometimes at the court of the Queen of France, who was her
  near relative. All who knew her were charmed with her. She was considered
  equally remarkable for her talents and for her beauty. The arrangement which
  had been made in her childhood for marrying her to the Count of St. Pol was
  broken off, but several other offers were made to her mother for her hand,
  though none of them was accepted. Isabella was very proud of her daughter,
  and she cherished very lofty aspirations in respect to her future destiny.
  She was therefore not at all inclined to be in haste in respect to making
  arrangements for her marriage.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the feud between the uncles and relatives of King Henry,
  in England, as related in a preceding chapter, had been going on, and was now
  reaching a climax. The leaders of the two rival parties were, as will be
  recollected, Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, or Cardinal Beaufort, as
  he was more commonly called, who had had the personal charge of the king
  during his minority, on one side, and the Duke of Gloucester, Henry's uncle,
  who had been regent of England during the same period, on the other. The king
  himself was now about twenty-four years of age, and if he had been a man of
  vigor and resolution, he might perhaps have controlled the angry disputants,
  and by taking the government fully into his own hands, have forced them to
  live together in peace under his paramount authority. But Henry was a very
  timid and feeble-minded man. The turbulence and impetuousness of his uncles
  and their partisans in their quarrel was altogether too great for any control
  that he could hope to exercise over them. Indeed, the great question with
  them was which should contrive the means of exercising the greatest control
  over him.</p>

  <p>In order to accomplish this end, both parties began very early to plan and
  manoeuvre with a view of choosing the king a wife. Whichever of the two great
  leaders should succeed in negotiating the marriage of the king, they knew
  well would, by that very act, establish his influence at court in the most
  absolute manner.</p>

  <p>Princes and kings in those days, as, indeed, is the case to a considerable
  extent now, had some peculiar difficulties to contend with in making their
  matrimonial arrangements, so far at least as concerned the indulgence of any
  personal preferences which they might themselves entertain on the subject.
  Indeed, these arrangements were generally made for them, while they were too
  young to have any voice or to take any part in the question, and nothing was
  left for them but to ratify and carry into effect, when they came to years of
  maturity, what their parents, or grand councils of state, had determined for
  them when they were children, or else to refuse to ratify and confirm it at
  the cost of incurring a vast amount of difficulty and political entanglement,
  and perhaps even open and formidable war.</p>

  <p>And even in those cases where the prince or king arrived at an age to
  judge for himself before any arrangements were made for him, which was the
  fact in regard to Henry VI., he was still very much embarrassed and
  circumscribed in his choice if he attempted to select a wife for himself. He
  could not visit foreign courts and see the princesses there, so as to judge
  for himself who would best please him; for in those days it was very unsafe
  for personages of any considerable rank or position to visit foreign
  countries at all, except at the head of an army, and in a military campaign.
  In the case, too, of any actually reigning monarch, there was a special
  difficulty in the way of his leaving his kingdom, on account of the feuds and
  quarrels which always in such cases arose in making the necessary
  arrangements for the government of the kingdom during his absence.</p>

  <p>For these and various other causes, a king or a prince desiring to choose
  a wife was obliged to content himself with such information relating to the
  several candidates as he could obtain from hearsay in respect to their
  characters, and from miniatures and portraits in respect to their personal
  attractions. This was especially the case with King Henry VI. Each of the two
  great parties, that of Cardinal Beaufort on one hand, and that of the Duke of
  Gloucester on the other, were desirous of being the means of finding a bride
  for the king, and both were eagerly looking in all directions, and plotting
  for the accomplishment of this end, and any attempt of the king to leave the
  kingdom for any purpose whatever would undoubtedly have brought these parties
  at once to open war.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Gloucester and those who acted with him fixed their eyes upon
  three princesses of a certain great family, called the house of Armagnac.
  Their plan was to open negotiations with this house, and to obtain portraits
  of the three princesses, to be sent to England, in order that Henry might
  take his choice of them. Commissioners were appointed to manage the business.
  They were to open the negotiations and obtain the portraits. The cardinal, of
  course, and his friends were greatly interested in preventing the success of
  this plan, though, of course, it was necessary for them to be discreet and
  cautious in manifesting any open opposition to it in the then present stage
  of the affair.</p>

  <p>The king was very particular in the instructions which he gave to the
  commissioners in respect to the portraits, with a view of securing, if
  possible, perfectly correct and fair representations of the originals. He
  wished that the princesses should not be flattered at all by the artist in
  his delineation of them, and that they should not be dressed at their
  sittings in any unusually elegant manner. On the contrary, they were to be
  painted "in their kirtles simple, and their visages like as ye see, and their
  stature, and their beauty, and the color of their skin, and their
  countenances, just as they really are." The artist was instructed, too, by
  the commissioners to be expeditious in finishing the pictures and sending
  them to England, in order that the king might see them as soon as possible,
  and make his choice between the three young ladies whose "images" were to be
  thus laid before him.</p>

  <p>This plan for giving the king an opportunity to choose between the three
  princesses of Armagnac, nicely arranged as it was in all its details, failed
  of being carried successfully into effect; for the father of these
  princesses, as it happened, was at this same time engaged in some
  negotiations with the King of France in respect to the marriage of his
  daughters, and he wished to keep the negotiations with Henry in suspense
  until he had ascertained whether he could or could not do better in that
  quarter. So he contrived means to interrupt and retard the work of the
  artist, in order to delay for a time the finishing of the pictures.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, while the Duke of Gloucester and his party were thus
  engaged in forwarding their scheme of inducing Henry to make choice of one of
  these three princesses for his wife, the cardinal himself was not idle. He
  had heard of the beautiful and accomplished Margaret of Anjou, and, after
  full inquiry and reflection, he determined in his own mind to make her his
  candidate for the honor of being Queen of England. The manner in which he
  contrived to introduce the subject first to the notice of the king was
  this.</p>

  <p>There was a certain man, named Champchevrier, who had been taken prisoner
  in Anjou in the course of the wars between France and England, and who was
  now held for ransom by the knight who had captured him. He was not, however,
  kept in close confinement, but was allowed to go at large in England on his
  parole&mdash;that is, on his word of honor that he would not make his escape
  and go back to his native land until his ransom was paid.</p>

  <p>Now this Champchevrier, though a prisoner, was a gentleman by birth and
  education; and while he remained in England, held by his parole, was admitted
  to the best society there, and he often appeared at court, and frequently
  held converse with the king. In one of these interviews he described, in very
  glowing terms, the beauty and remarkable intelligence of Margaret of Anjou.
  It is supposed that he was induced to this by Cardinal Beaufort, who knew of
  his acquaintance with Margaret, and who contrived the interviews between
  Champchevrier and the king, in order to give the former an opportunity to
  speak of the lady to his majesty incidentally, as it were, and in a way not
  to excite the king's suspicions that the commendations of her which he heard
  were prompted by any match-making schemes formed for him by his
  courtiers.</p>

  <p>If this was the secret plan of the cardinal, it succeeded admirably well.
  The king's curiosity was strongly awakened by the piquant accounts that
  Champchevrier gave him of the brilliancy of young Margaret's beauty, and of
  her charming vivacity and wit.</p>

  <p>"I should like very much to see a picture of the young lady," said the
  king.</p>

  <p>"I can easily obtain a picture of her for your majesty," replied
  Champchevrier, "if your majesty will commission me to go to Lorraine for the
  purpose."</p>

  <p>Champchevrier considered that a commission from the king to go to Lorraine
  on business for his majesty would be a sufficient release for him from the
  obligations of his parole.</p>

  <p>The king finally gave Champchevrier the required authority to leave the
  kingdom. Champchevier was not satisfied with a verbal permission merely, but
  required the king to give him a regular safe-conduct, drawn up in due form,
  and signed by the king's name. Having received this document, Champchevrier
  left London and set out upon his journey, the nature and object of the
  expedition being of course kept a profound secret.</p>

  <p>A certain nobleman, however, named the Earl of Suffolk, was admitted to
  the confidence of the king in this affair, and was by him associated with
  Champchevrier in the arrangements which were to be made for carrying the plan
  into execution. It would seem that he accompanied Champchevrier in his
  journey to Lorraine, where Margaret was then residing with her mother, and
  there assisted him in making arrangements for the painting of the picture.
  They employed one of the first artists in France for this purpose. When the
  work was finished, Champchevrier set out with it on his return to
  England.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the English knight whose prisoner Champchevrier was,
  heard in some way that his captive had left England, and had returned to
  France, and the intelligence made him exceedingly angry. He thought that
  Champchevrier had broken his parole and had gone home without paying his
  ransom. Such an act as this was regarded as extremely dishonorable in those
  days, and it was, moreover, not only considered dishonorable in a prisoner
  himself to break his parole, but also in any one else to aid or abet him in
  so doing, or to harbor or protect him after his escape. The knight
  determined, therefore, that he would at once communicate with the King of
  France on the subject, explaining the circumstances, and asking him to
  rearrest the supposed fugitive and send him back.</p>

  <p>So he went to the Duke of Gloucester, and, stating the case to him, asked
  his grace to write to the King of France, informing him that Champchevrier
  had escaped from his parole, and asking him not to give him refuge, but to
  seize and send him back. Gloucester was very willing to do this. It is
  probable that he knew that Champchevrier was a friend of the cardinal's, or
  at least that he was attached to his interests, and that it was altogether
  probable that his going into France was connected with some plot or scheme by
  which the cardinal and his party were to derive some advantage. So he wrote
  the letter, and it was at once sent to the King of France. The King of France
  at this time was Charles VII.</p>

  <p>The king, on receiving the letter, gave orders immediately that
  Champchevrier should be arrested. By this time, however, the painting was
  finished, and Champchevrier was on the way with it from Lorraine toward
  England. He was intercepted on his journey, taken to Vincennes, and there
  brought before King Charles, and called upon to give an account of
  himself.</p>

  <p>Of course he was now obliged to tell the whole story. He said that he had
  not broken his parole at all, nor intended in any manner to defraud his
  captor in England of the ransom money that was due to him, but had come to
  France by the orders of the King of England. He explained, too, what he had
  come for, and showed Charles the painting which he was carrying back to the
  king. He also, in proof of the truth of what he said, produced the
  safe-conduct which King Henry had given him.</p>

  <p>King Charles laughed very heartily at hearing this explanation, and at
  perceiving how neatly he had discovered the secret of King Henry's love
  affairs. He was much pleased, too, with the idea of King Henry's taking a
  fancy to a lady so nearly related to the royal family of France. He thought
  that he might make the negotiation of such a marriage the occasion for making
  peace with England on favorable terms. So he dismissed Champchevrier at once,
  and recommended to him to proceed to England as soon as possible, and there
  to do all in his power to induce King Henry to choose Margaret for his
  queen.</p>

  <p>Champchevrier accordingly returned to England and reported the result of
  his mission. The king was very much pleased with the painting, and he
  immediately determined to send Champchevrier again to Lorraine on a secret
  mission to Margaret's mother. He first, however, determined to release
  Champchevrier entirely from his parole, and so he paid the ransom himself for
  which he had been held. The Duke of Gloucester watched all these proceedings
  with a very jealous eye. When he found that Champchevrier, on his return to
  England, came at once to the king's court, and that there he held frequent
  conferences, which were full of mystery, with the king and with the cardinal,
  and when, moreover, he learned that the king had paid the ransom money due to
  the knight, and that Champchevrier was to be sent away again, he at once
  suspected what was going on, and the whole court was soon in a great ferment
  of excitement in respect to the proposed marriage of the king to Margaret of
  Anjou.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Gloucester and his party were, of course, strongly opposed to
  Margaret of Anjou; for they knew well that, as she had been brought to the
  king's notice by the other party, her becoming Queen of England would
  well-nigh destroy their hopes and expectations for all time to come. The
  other party acted as decidedly and vigorously in favor of the marriage. There
  followed a long contest, in which there was plotting and counterplotting on
  one side and on the other, and manoeuvres without end. At last the friends of
  the beautiful little Margaret carried the day; and in the year 1444
  commissioners were formally appointed by the governments of England and
  France to meet at the city of Tours at a specified day, to negotiate a truce
  between the two countries preparatory to a permanent peace, the basis and
  cement of which was to be the marriage of King Henry with Margaret of Anjou.
  The truce was made for two years, so as to allow full time to arrange all the
  details both for a peace between the two countries, and also in respect to
  the terms and conditions of the marriage.</p>

  <p>As soon as the news that this truce was made arrived in England it
  produced great excitement. The Duke of Gloucester and those who were, with
  him, interested to prevent the accomplishment of the marriage, formed a
  powerful political party to oppose it. They did not, however, openly object
  to the marriage itself, thinking that not politic, but directed their
  hostility chiefly against the plan of making peace with France just at the
  time, they said, when the glory of the English arms and the progress of the
  English power in that country were at their height. It was very discreditable
  to the advisers of the king, they said, that they should counsel him to stop
  short in the career of conquest which his armies were pursuing, and thus
  sacrifice the grand advantages for the realm of England which were just
  within reach.</p>

  <p>The discussions and dissensions which arose in the court and in Parliament
  on this subject were very violent; but in the end Cardinal Beaufort and his
  party were successful, and the king appointed the Earl of Suffolk embassador
  extraordinary to the court of France to negotiate the terms and conditions of
  the permanent peace which was to be made between the two countries, and also
  of the marriage of the king. At first Suffolk was very unwilling to undertake
  this embassy. He feared that, in order to carry out the king's wishes, he
  should be obliged to make such important concessions to France that, at some
  future time, when perhaps the party of the Duke of Gloucester should come
  into power, he might be held responsible for the measure, and be tried and
  condemned, perhaps, for high treason, in having been the means of sacrificing
  the interests and honor of the kingdom by advising and negotiating a
  dishonorable peace. These fears of his were probably increased by the
  intensity of the excitement which he perceived in the Gloucester party, and
  perhaps, also, by open threats and demonstrations which they may have uttered
  for the express purpose of intimidating him.</p>

  <p>At any rate, after receiving the appointment, his courage failed him, and
  he begged the king to excuse him from performing so dangerous a commission.
  The king was, however, very unwilling to do so. Finally, it was agreed that
  the king should give the earl his written order, executed in due and solemn
  form, and signed with the great seal, commanding him, on the royal authority,
  to undertake the embassage. Suffolk relied on this document as his means of
  defense from all legal responsibility for his action in case his enemies
  should at any future time have it in their power to bring him to trial for
  it.</p>

  <p>In negotiating the peace, and in arranging the terms and conditions of the
  marriage, a great many difficulties were found to be in the way, but they
  were all, at last overcome. One of these difficulties was made by King Ren,
  the father of Margaret. He declared that he could not consent to give his
  daughter in marriage to the King of England unless the king would first
  restore to him and to his family the province of Anjou, which had been the
  possession of his ancestors, but which King Henry's armies had overrun and
  conquered. The Earl of Suffolk was very unwilling to cede back this
  territory, for he knew very well that nothing would be so unpopular in
  England, or so likely to increase the hostility of the English people to the
  proposed marriage, and consequently to give new life and vigor to the
  Gloucester party in their opposition to it, as the giving up again of
  territory which the English troops had won by so many hard-fought battles and
  the sacrifice of so many lives. But Ren was inflexible, and Suffolk finally
  yielded, and so Anjou was restored to its former possessors.</p>

  <p>Another objection which Ren made was that his fortune was not sufficient
  to enable him to endow his daughter properly for so splendid a marriage; not
  having the means, he said, of sending her in a suitable manner into
  England.</p>

  <p>But this the King of England said should make no difference. All that he
  asked was the hand of the princess without any dowry. Her personal charms and
  mental endowments were sufficient to outweigh all the riches in the world;
  and if her royal father and mother would grant her to King Henry as his
  bride, he would not ask to receive with her "either penny or farthing."</p>

  <p>King Henry was made all the more eager to close the negotiations for the
  marriage as soon as possible, and to consent to almost any terms which the
  King of France and Ren might exact, from the fact that there was a young
  prince of the house of Burgundy&mdash;a very brave, handsome, and
  accomplished man&mdash;who was also a suitor for Margaret's hand, and was
  very devotedly attached to her. This young prince was in France at this time,
  and ready, at any moment, to take advantage of any difficulty which might
  arise in the negotiations with Henry to press his claims, and, perhaps, to
  carry off the prize. Which of the two candidates Margaret herself would have
  preferred there is no means of knowing. She was yet only about fifteen years
  of age, and was completely in the power and at the disposal of her father and
  mother. And then the political and family interests which were at stake in
  the decision of the question were too vast to allow of the personal
  preferences of the young girl herself being taken much into the account.</p>

  <p>At last every thing was arranged, and Suffolk returned to England,
  bringing with him the treaty of peace and the contract of marriage, to be
  ratified by the king's council and by Parliament. A new contest now ensued
  between the Gloucester and Beaufort parties. The king, of course, threw all
  his influence on the cardinal's side, and so the treaty and the contract
  carried the day. Both were ratified. The Earl of Suffolk, as a reward for his
  services, was made a marquis, and he was appointed the king's proxy to
  proceed to France and espouse the bride in the king's name, according to the
  usual custom in the case of royal marriages.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE WEDDING</h2>

  <p class="first">PREPARATIONS were now immediately made for solemnizing the
  marriage and bringing the young queen at once to England. The marriage
  ceremony by which a foreign princess was united to a reigning prince,
  according to the custom of those times, was two-fold, or, rather, there were
  two distinct ceremonies to be performed, in one of which the bride, at her
  father's own court, was united to her future husband by proxy, and in the
  second the nuptials were celebrated anew with her husband himself in person,
  after her arrival in his kingdom. Suffolk, as was stated in the last chapter,
  was appointed to act as the king's proxy in this case, for the performance of
  the first of these ceremonies. He was to proceed to France, espouse the bride
  in the king's name, and convey her to England. Of course a universal
  excitement now spread itself among all the nobility and among all the ladies
  of the court, which was awakened by the interest which all took in the
  approaching wedding, and the desire they felt to accompany the
  expedition.</p>

  <p>A great many of the lords and ladies began to make preparations to join
  Lord and Lady Suffolk. Nothing was talked of but dresses, equipments,
  presents, invitations, and every body was occupied in the collecting and
  packing of stores and baggage for a long journey. At length the appointed
  time arrived, and the expedition set out, and, after a journey of many days,
  the several parties which composed it arrived at Nancy, the capital city of
  Lorraine, where the ceremony was to be performed.</p>

  <p>At about the same time, the King and Queen of France, accompanied by a
  great concourse of nobles and gentlemen from the French court, who were to
  honor the wedding with their presence, arrived. A great many other knights
  and ladies, too, from the provinces and castles of the surrounding country,
  were seen coming in gay and splendid cavalcades to the town, when the
  appointed day drew nigh, eager to witness the ceremony, and to join in the
  magnificent festivities which they well knew would be arranged to commemorate
  and honor the occasion. In a word, the whole town became one brilliant scene
  of gayety, life, and excitement.</p>

  <p>The marriage ceremony was performed in the church, with great pomp and
  parade, and in the midst of a vast concourse of people, composed of the
  highest nobility of Europe, both lords and ladies, and all dressed in the
  most magnificent and distinguished costumes. No spectacle could possibly be
  more splendid and gay. At the close of the ceremony, the bride was placed
  solemnly in charge of Lady Suffolk, who was to be responsible for her safety
  and welfare until she should arrive in England, and there be delivered into
  the hands of her husband. Lady Suffolk was a cousin of Cardinal Beaufort, and
  she undoubtedly received this very exalted appointment through his favor. The
  appointment brought with it a great deal of patronage and influence, for a
  regular and extended household was now to be organized for the service of the
  new queen, and of course, among all the lords and ladies who had come from
  England, there was a very eager competition to obtain places in it. There are
  enumerated among those who were appointed to posts of service or honor in
  attendance on the queen, under the Marchioness of Suffolk, five barons and
  baronesses, seventeen knights, sixty-five squires, and no less than one
  hundred and seventy-four valets, besides many other servitors, all under pay.
  Then, in addition to these, so great was the eagerness to occupy some
  recognized station in the train of the bride, that great numbers applied for
  appointments to nominal offices for which they were to receive no pay.</p>

  <p>If Ren, Margaret's father, had been possessed of a fortune corresponding
  to his rank, the expense of all these arrangements, at least up to the time
  of the departure of the bridal party, would have been defrayed by him; but as
  it was, every thing was paid for by King Henry, and the precise amount of
  every expenditure stands recorded in certain old books of accounts which
  still remain among the ancient English archives.</p>

  <p>The nuptials of the princess were celebrated by a tournament and other
  accompanying festivities, which were continued for eight days. In these
  tournaments a great many mock combats were fought, in which the most exalted
  personages present on the occasion took conspicuous and prominent parts. The
  King of France himself appeared in the lists, and fought with Ren, the
  father of the bride. The king was beaten. It would have been impolite for any
  one to have vanquished the father of the bride at a tournament held in honor
  of the daughter's nuptials. The Count St. Pol, too, who had formerly been
  betrothed to Margaret, but had not been allowed to marry her, fought very
  successfully, and won a valuable prize, which was conferred upon him with
  great ceremony by the hands of the two most distinguished ladies present,
  namely, the Queen of France and Isabella of Lorraine, the bride's mother.
  Perhaps he too was politely allowed to win his victory and his honorary
  prize, in consideration of his submitting so quietly to the loss of the real
  prize which his great competitor, the King of England, was so triumphantly
  bearing away from him.</p>

  <p>The celebrations of the eight days were interrupted and enlivened by one
  remarkable incident, which for a time threatened to produce very serious
  difficulty. It will be remembered that when the original contract and treaty
  were made between Ren and the uncle of Isabella, Antoine of Vaudemonte, at
  the time when peace was re-established between them, after the battle in
  which Ren was taken prisoner, that not only was it agreed that Margaret
  should be betrothed to the Count St. Pol, but also that Yolante, Margaret's
  elder sister, was betrothed to Antoine's son Ferry, as he was called. Now
  Ferry seemed not disposed to submit quietly, as St. Pol had done, to the loss
  of his bride, and as he had never thus far been able to induce Ren and
  Isabella to fulfill their agreement by consenting to the consummation of the
  marriage, he determined now to take the matter into his own hands. So he
  formed the scheme of an elopement. His plan was to take advantage of the
  excitement and confusion attendant on the tournament for carrying off his
  bride. He organized a band of adventurous young knights who were willing to
  aid him in his enterprise, and, laying his plans secretly and carefully, he,
  assisted by his comrades, seized the young lady and galloped away with her to
  a place of safety, intending to keep her there in his own custody until King
  Ren and her mother should consent to her immediate marriage, King Ren, when
  he first heard of his daughter's abduction, was very angry, and declared that
  he would never forgive either Ferry or Yolante. But the King and Queen of
  France interceded for the lovers, and Ren at last relented. Ferry and
  Yolante were married, and all parties were made friends again, after which
  the celebrations and festivities were renewed with greater spirit and ardor
  than before.</p>

  <p>At length the time for the conclusion of the public rejoicings at Nancy,
  and for the commencement of Margaret's journey to England, arrived. Thus far,
  though nominally under the care and keeping of Lord and Lady Suffolk,
  Margaret had of course been really most intimately associated with her own
  family and friends; but now the time had come when she was to take a final
  leave of her father and mother, and of all whom she had known and loved from
  infancy, and be put really and fully into the trust and keeping of strangers,
  to be taken by them to a distant and foreign land. The parting was very
  painful. It seems that Margaret's beauty and the charming vivacity of her
  manners had made her universally beloved, and the hearts not only of her
  father and mother, but of the whole circle of those who had known her, were
  filled with grief at the thought of parting with her forever.</p>

  <p>The King and Queen of France, who seem to have loved their niece with
  sincere affection, determined to accompany her for a short distance, as she
  set out on her journey from Nancy. Of course, many of the courtiers went too.
  These, together with the great number of English nobles and gentry that were
  attached to the service of the bride, made so large a company, and the
  dresses, caparisons, and trappings which were exhibited on the occasion were
  so splendid and fine, that the cavalcade, as it set out from the city of
  Nancy on the morning when the journey was to commence, formed one of the
  gayest and grandest bridal processions that the world has ever seen.</p>

  <p>After proceeding for five or six miles the procession came to a halt, in
  order that the King and Queen of France might take their leave. The parting
  filled the hearts of their majesties with grief. The king clasped Margaret
  again and again in his arms when he bade her farewell, and told her that in
  placing her, as he had done, upon one of the greatest thrones in Europe, it
  seemed to him, after all, that he had really done nothing for her, "for even
  such a throne is scarcely worthy of you, my darling child," said he. In
  saying this his eyes filled with tears. The queen was so overwhelmed with
  emotion that she could not speak; but, kissing Margaret again and again amid
  her sobbings and tears, she finally turned from her and was borne away.</p>

  <p>Margaret's father and mother did not take their leave of her at this
  place, but went on with her two days' journey, as far as to the town of Bar
  le Duc, which was near the frontiers of Lorraine. Here they, too, at last
  took their leave, though their hearts were so full, when the moment of final
  parting came that they could not speak, but bade their child farewell with
  tears and caresses, unaccompanied with any words whatever of farewell.</p>

  <p>Still Margaret was not left entirely alone among strangers when her father
  and mother left her. One of her brothers, and some other friends, were to
  accompany her to England. She had, moreover, by this time become well
  acquainted with the Marquis and Marchioness of Suffolk, under whose charge
  and protection she was now traveling, and she had become strongly attached to
  them. They were both considerably advanced in life, and were grave and quiet
  in their demeanor, but they were very kind and attentive to Margaret in every
  respect, and they made every effort in their power to console the grief that
  she felt at parting with her parents and friends, and leaving her native
  land, and they endeavored in every way to make the journey as comfortable and
  as agreeable as possible to her.</p>

  <p>During all this time a vessel, which had been dispatched from England for
  the purpose, was waiting at a certain port on the northern coast of France
  called Kiddelaws, ready to take the queen and her bridal train across the
  Channel. The distance from Nancy to this port was very considerable, and the
  means and facilities for traveling enjoyed in those days were so imperfect
  that a great deal of time was necessarily employed on the journey. Besides
  this, a long delay was occasioned by the want of funds. King Henry had
  himself agreed to defray all the expenses of the marriage, and also of the
  progress of the bridal party through France to England. These expenses were
  necessarily great, and it happened at this time that the king was in very
  straitened circumstances in respect to funds. He was greatly embarrassed,
  too, in the efforts which he made to procure money, by the difficulties which
  were thrown in his way by the party of the Duke of Gloucester, who resisted
  by every means in their power all action of Parliament tending to furnish the
  king's treasury with money, and thus promote the final accomplishment of the
  marriage.</p>

  <p>In consequence of all these difficulties and delays, it was nearly three
  months from the time when the bridal ceremony was performed at Nancy before
  Margaret was ready to embark for England in the vessel that awaited her at
  Kiddelaws.</p>

  <p>It was not merely for the expenses of the journey through France of
  Margaret and her train that Henry had to provide. On her arrival in England
  there was to be a grand reception, which would require many costly equipages,
  and the giving of many entertainments. Then, moreover, the marriage ceremony
  was to be performed anew, and in a far more pompous and imposing manner than
  before, and after the marriage a coronation, with all the attendant
  festivities and celebrations. All these things involved great expense, and
  Margaret could not come into the kingdom until the preparations were made for
  the whole. To such straits was the king reduced in his efforts to raise the
  money which he deemed necessary for the proper reception of his bride, that
  he was obliged to pledge a large portion of the crown jewels, and also of the
  family plate and other personal property of that kind. A considerable part of
  the property so pledged was never redeemed.</p>

  <p>At length, however, things were so far in readiness that orders arrived
  for the sailing of the expedition. The party accordingly embarked, and the
  vessel sailed. They crossed the Channel, and entered Portsmouth harbor, and
  finally landed at the town of Porchester, which is situated at the head of
  the harbor. The voyage was not very agreeable. The vessel was small, and the
  Channel in this place is wide, and Margaret was so sick during the passage,
  and became so entirely exhausted, that when the vessel reached the port she
  could not stand, and Suffolk carried her to the shore in his arms.</p>

  <p>The boisterous weather which had attended the party during their voyage
  increased till it ended in a dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, and rain,
  which burst over the town of Porchester just at the time while the party were
  landing. The people, however, paid no attention to the storm and rain, but
  flocked in crowds into the streets where the bride was to pass, and strewed
  rushes along the way to make a carpet for her. They also filled the air with
  joyful acclamations as the procession passed along. In this way the royal
  bride was conveyed through the town to a convent in the vicinity, where she
  was to rest for the first night, and prepare for continuing her journey to
  London.</p>

  <p>The next day, the weather having become settled and fair, it was arranged
  that Margaret and her party should be conveyed from Porchester to Southampton
  along the shore in barges. The water of this passage is smooth, being
  sheltered every where by the land. The barges first moved down Portsmouth
  harbor, then out into what is called the Solent Sea, which is a narrow,
  sheltered, and beautiful sheet of water, lying between the Isle of Wight and
  the main land, and thence, entering Southampton Water, they passed up, a
  distance of eight or ten miles, to the town.</p>

  <p>On the arrival of the queen at Southampton, she was conveyed again to a
  convent in the vicinity of the town, for this was before the days of hotels.
  Here she was met by persons sent from the king to assist her in respect to
  her farther preparations for appearing at his court. Among other measures
  that were adopted, one was the sending a special messenger to London to bring
  an English dressmaker to Southampton, in order that suitable dresses might be
  prepared for the bride, to enable her to appear properly in the presence of
  the English ladies at the approaching ceremonies.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, King Henry, whom the rules of royal etiquette did not
  allow to join the queen until the time should arrive for the performance of
  the second part of the nuptial ceremony, came down from London, and took up
  his abode at a place ten or twelve miles distant, called Southwick, where he
  had a palace and a park. The nuptials were to be celebrated at a certain
  abbey called Lichfield Abbey, which was situated about midway between
  Southampton, where the queen was lodged, and Southwick, the place of waiting
  for the king. The king had expected that every thing would be ready in a few
  days, but he was destined to encounter a new delay. Margaret had scarcely
  arrived in Southampton when she was attacked by an eruptive fever of some
  sort, resembling small-pox, which threw all her friends into a state of great
  alarm concerning her. The disease, however, proved less serious than was at
  first apprehended, and after a week or two the danger seemed to be over.</p>

  <p>During all the time while his bride was thus sick Henry remained in great
  suspense and anxiety at Southwick, being forbidden, by the rigid rules of
  royal etiquette, to see her.</p>

  <p>At length Margaret recovered, and the day was appointed for the final
  celebration of the nuptials. When the time arrived, Margaret was conveyed in
  great state, and at the head of a splendid cavalcade, to the abbey, and there
  the marriage ceremony was again performed in the presence of a great
  concourse of lords and ladies that had come from London and Windsor, or from
  their various castles in the country around, to be present on the
  occasion.</p>

    <p class="caption">Suffolk Presenting Margaret to the King</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>This final ceremony was performed in April, 1445. Of course, as Margaret
  was born in March, 1429, she was at this time sixteen years and one month
  old.</p>

  <p>Among other curious incidents which are recorded in connection with this
  wedding, there is an account of Margaret's receiving, as a present on the
  occasion&mdash;for a pet, as it were, just as at the present day a young
  bride might receive a gift of a spaniel or a canary-bird&mdash;a lion. It was
  very common in those times for the wealthy nobles to keep such animals as
  these at their castles. They were confined in dens constructed for them near
  the castle walls. The kings of England, however, kept their lions, when they
  had any, in the Tower of London, and the practice thus established of keeping
  wild beasts in the Tower was continued down to a very late period; so that I
  remember of often reading, when I was a boy, in English story-books, accounts
  of children, when they went to London, being taken by their parents to see
  the "lions in the Tower."</p>

  <p>Margaret sent her lion to the Tower. In the book of expenses which was
  kept for this famous bridal progress, there is an account of the sum of money
  paid to two men for taking care of this lion, feeding him and conveying him
  to London. The amount was 2 5s. 3d., which is equal to about ten or twelve
  dollars of our money. This seems very little for such a service, but it must
  be remembered that the value of money was much greater in those times than it
  is now.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the marriage ceremony was completed, the preparations
  for the journey having been all made beforehand, the king and queen set out
  together for London, and it soon began to appear that this part of the
  journey was to be more splendid and gay than any other. The people of the
  country, who had heard marvelous stories of the youth and beauty and the
  early family misfortunes of the queen, flocked in crowds along the roadsides
  to get a glimpse of her as she passed, and to gaze on the grand train of
  knights and nobles that accompanied her, and to admire the magnificence of
  the dresses and decorations which were so profusely displayed. Every body
  came wearing a daisy in his cap or in his button-hole, for the daisy was the
  flower which Margaret had chosen for her emblem. At every town through which
  the bride passed she was met by immense crowds that thronged all the
  accessible places, and filled the windows, and in some places covered the
  roofs of the houses and the tops of the walls, and welcomed her with the
  sound of trumpets, the waving of banners, and with prolonged shouts and
  acclamations.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the Duke of Gloucester, who, with his party, had done
  every thing in his power to oppose the marriage, now, finding that it was an
  accomplished fact, and that all farther opposition would not only be useless,
  but would only tend to hasten and complete his own utter downfall, concluded
  to change his course, and join heartily himself in the general welcome which
  was given to the bride. His plan was to persuade the queen that the
  opposition which he had made to King Henry's measures was directed only
  against the peace which had been made with France, and which he had opposed
  for political considerations alone, but that, so far as the marriage with
  Margaret was concerned, he approved it. So he prepared to outdo, if possible,
  all the rest of the nobility in the magnificence of the welcome which he was
  to give her on her arrival in London. He possessed a palace at Greenwich, on
  the Thames, a short distance below London, and he sent an invitation to
  Margaret to come there on the last day of her journey, in order to rest and
  refresh herself a little preparatory to the excitement and fatigue of
  entering London. Margaret accepted this invitation, and when the bridal
  procession began to draw nigh, Gloucester came forth to meet her at the head
  of a band of five hundred of his own retainers, all dressed in his uniform,
  and wearing the badge of his personal service. This great parade was intended
  partly to do honor to the bride, and partly to impress her with a proper
  sense of his own rank and importance as one of the nobles of England, and of
  the danger that she would incur in making him her enemy.</p>

  <p>Very splendid preparations were made in the city of London to do honor to
  the royal bride in her passage through the city. It was the custom in those
  times to exhibit in the streets, on great public days, tableaux, and
  emblematic or dramatic representations of certain truths or moral sentiments
  appropriate to the occasion, and sometimes of passages of Scripture history.
  A great many of these exhibitions were arranged by the citizens of London, to
  be seen by the bride and the bridal procession as they passed through the
  streets. Some of these were very quaint and queer, and would only be laughed
  at at the present day. For instance, in one place was an arrangement of two
  figures, one dressed to represent justice, and the other peace; and these
  figures were made movable and fitted with strings, so that, at the proper
  moment, when the queen was passing, they could be made to come together and
  apparently kiss each other. This was intended as an expression of the text,
  justice and peace have kissed each other, which was considered as an
  appropriate text to characterize and commemorate the peace between England
  and France which this marriage had sealed. In another place there was an
  emblematical pageant representing peace and plenty. There were also, at other
  places, representations of Noah's ark, of the parable of the wise and foolish
  virgins, of the heavenly Jerusalem, and even one of the general resurrection
  and judgment day.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the day appointed for the queen's entry into London, the
  pageants having all been prepared and set up in their places, a grand
  procession of the mayor and aldermen, and other dignitaries, was formed, and
  proceeded down the river toward Greenwich, in order to meet the queen and
  escort her through the city. These civic officers were all mounted on
  horseback, and dressed in their gay official costumes. The chiefs were
  dressed in scarlet, and the body of their followers, arranged in bands
  according to their respective trades, wore blue gowns, with embroidered
  sleeves and red hoods. In this way the royal procession was escorted over
  London Bridge, and through the principal streets of the city to Westminster,
  where the bride was at length safely received in the palace of her
  husband.</p>

  <p>This was on the 28th of May. Two days afterward Margaret was crowned queen
  in Westminster with great parade and ceremony. The coronation was followed by
  a grand tournament of three days' duration, accompanied with banquets and
  other festivities usual on such occasions, and then at length the bride had
  the satisfaction of feeling that the long-protracted ceremony was over, and
  that she was now to be left to repose.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; RECEPTION IN ENGLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">NOTWITHSTANDING the grand reception which the Duke of
  Gloucester gave to Margaret on her arrival in England, she knew very well
  that he had always been opposed to her marriage, and had not failed to do all
  in his power to prevent it. She accordingly considered him as her enemy; and
  though she endeavored at first, at least, to treat him with outward
  politeness, she felt a secret resentment against him in heart, and would have
  been very glad to have joined his political enemies in effecting his
  overthrow.</p>

  <p>Cardinal Beaufort and the Earl of Suffolk, as has already been said, were
  Gloucester's rivals and enemies. The cardinal was a venerable man, now quite
  advanced in years. He was, however, extremely ambitious. He was immensely
  wealthy, and his wealth gave him great influence. He had, moreover, been the
  guardian of the king during his minority, and in that capacity had acquired a
  great influence over his mind. The Earl of Suffolk, who, with his lady, had
  been sent to France to bring Margaret over, had inspired Margaret with a
  great friendship for him. She felt a strong affection for him, and also for
  Lady Suffolk, not only on account of their having acted so important a part
  in promoting her marriage, but also on account of the very kind and attentive
  manner in which they had treated her during the whole period of her journey.
  Thus the cardinal and Suffolk, on the one hand, had the advantage, in their
  quarrel with the Duke of Gloucester, of great personal influence over the
  king and queen, while, Gloucester himself, on the other hand, enjoyed in some
  respects a still greater advantage in his popularity with the mass of the
  people. Every body perceived that the old quarrel between these great
  personages would now, on the arrival of the queen in England, be prosecuted
  with more violence than ever, and all the courtiers were anxious to find out
  which was likely to be the victor, so that, at the end of the battle, they
  might be found on the winning side.</p>

  <p>As soon as the coronation was over, the principal personages who had been
  sent with Margaret by her father, for the purpose of accompanying her on her
  journey, and seeing her properly and comfortably established in her new home,
  were dismissed and allowed to set out on their return. They all received
  presents in money from King Henry to reimburse them for the expenses of the
  journey which they had made in bringing him his bride.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ancient Portrait of Queen Margaret</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Margaret was thus left to herself in the new station and new sphere of
  duty to which she had been transferred. All the royal palaces had been fitted
  up expressly for her reception. This was very necessary in fact, for some
  years had elapsed since there had been a queen in England, and all the royal
  residences had become very much out of repair. Those were rude times, and
  even the palaces and castles that were built for kings and queens were at
  best very comfortless dwellings. But when, during a long minority, they were
  abandoned to the rude tenants and rough usages to which at such times they
  were sure to be devoted, they came, in the end, to be little better than so
  many barracks for soldiery. It required a great deal of time, and no little
  expense, to prepare the Tower and the palaces of Westminster and Richmond for
  the reception of a young and beautiful queen, and of the gay company of
  ladies that were to attend her. King Henry was so destitute of money at this
  time that he found it extremely difficult to provide the means of paying the
  workmen. There is still extant a petition which the clerk of the works sent
  in to the king, praying him to supply him with more money to pay the men, for
  the labor was so poorly paid, and the wages were so much in arrears, that it
  was extremely difficult for him to find men, he said, to go on with the
  work.</p>

  <p>The palaces were, however, at last made ready before Margaret came. There
  were apartments for her in the Tower, and there were also three other palaces
  in and near London, in either of which she could reside at her pleasure.
  Besides this, the cardinal, who, as has already been remarked, was possessed
  of immense wealth, owned, among his other establishments, a beautiful mansion
  at Waltham Forest, a few miles north of London. The cardinal set apart a
  state chamber in this house for the exclusive use of the queen when she came
  to visit him, and caused it to be fitted up and furnished in a magnificent
  manner for her. The drapery of the bed was of cloth of gold from Damascus,
  and the other furniture and fittings were to correspond. The queen used often
  to go and visit the cardinal at this country seat. She soon became very fond
  of him, and willing to be guided by his counsel in almost every thing that
  she did. Indeed, the ascendency which the cardinal thus exercised over
  Margaret greatly increased his power over the king. The affairs of the court
  and of the government were directed almost wholly by his counsels. The Duke
  of Gloucester and the nobles of his party became more and more indignant and
  angry al this state of things. The realm of England, they said, through the
  weakness and imbecility of the king, had fallen into the hands of a priest
  and of a woman&mdash;a French woman, too.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing that they could do. Margaret was so young and so
  beautiful that every body was captivated with her person and behavior, and
  whatever she did was thought to be right. Indeed, the general course which
  she pursued on her first arrival in England was right in an eminent degree.
  There have been many cases in which young queens, in coming as Margaret did,
  away from their native land and from all their early friends, to reign in a
  foreign court, have brought with them from home personages of distinction to
  be their favorites and friends in their new position. But when this is done,
  jealousies and ill-will always sooner or later spring up between these
  relatives and friends of the foreign bride and the old native advisers of the
  king her husband. The result is, in the end, a king's party and a queen's
  party at court, and perpetual quarrels and dissensions ensue, in which at
  least the people of the country are sure to become involved, from their
  natural jealousy of the foreign influence, as they call it, introduced by the
  queen.</p>

  <p>Queen Margaret had the good sense to avoid this danger. All the principal
  persons who came with her to England, for the purpose of accompanying her on
  the journey, and of carrying back to her father and friends in France
  authentic assurances of her having been honorably received by her husband as
  his bride and queen, were dismissed and sent home again immediately after the
  coronation, as we have already seen. Margaret retained only certain domestic
  servants, and perhaps some two or three private and personal friends. As for
  counselors and advisers, she threw herself at once upon the ministers and
  counselors of the king&mdash;the Cardinal Beaufort, who had been his guardian
  from childhood, and the Earl of Suffolk, who was one of his principal
  ministers, and had been sent by him, as his proxy and representative, to
  negotiate the marriage and bring home the bride. She made Lady Suffolk,
  too&mdash;the wife of the earl&mdash;her most intimate female friend. She
  appointed her to the principal place of honor in her household, and in other
  ways manifested great affection for her. The good sense and discretion which
  she thus manifested&mdash;young as she was, for she was not yet
  seventeen&mdash;in choosing for her confidential friend a lady of the age and
  standing of Lady Suffolk, instead of attempting to place in that position
  some foreign belle of her own years, whom she had brought with her for the
  purpose from her native land, as many young brides in her situation would
  have done, deserves much commendation. In a word, Margaret, in becoming a
  wife, gave herself up entirely to her husband. She made his friends her
  friends, and his interests her interests, and thus transferred herself,
  wholly and without reserve, to her new position; an example which all young
  ladies whose marriage brings them into entirely new circumstances and
  relations would do well to follow. Nothing is more dangerous than the attempt
  in such cases to bring from the old home influences in any form to be
  introduced with a view of sharing the control in the new.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the discreet course of conduct that Margaret thus
  pursued, and of the effect produced on the court by her beauty, her vivacity,
  and her many polite accomplishments, public opinion&mdash;that is, the
  opinion of the outside world, who knew nothing of her secret designs or of
  her real character&mdash;turned very soon after her arrival in England
  entirely in her favor. As has already been said, the general sentiment of the
  nobles and of the people was strongly against the match when it was first
  proposed. They opposed it, not because they had any personal objection to
  Margaret herself, but because, in order to prepare the way for it, it was
  necessary to make peace with France, and in making peace, to grant certain
  concessions which they thought would weaken the power f of the English on the
  Continent, and, at any rate, greatly interfere with the farther extension of
  their power there. But when the people came to see and know the queen, they
  all admired and loved her.</p>

  <p>As for the king, he was perfectly enchanted with his bride. He was
  himself, as has already been said, of a very sedate and quiet turn of mind;
  amiable and gentle in disposition; devout, fond of retirement, and interested
  only in such occupations and pleasures as are consistent with a life of
  tranquillity and repose. Margaret was as different as possible from all this.
  Her brilliant personal charms, her wit, her spirit, her general intellectual
  superiority, the extraordinary courage for which she afterward became so
  celebrated, and which began to show itself even at this early period, all
  combined to awaken in Henry's mind a profound admiration for his wife, and
  gave her a great and rapidly-increasing ascendency over him.</p>

  <p>The impression which Margaret made upon the people was equally favorable.
  England, they thought, had never seen a queen more worthy of the throne than
  Margaret of Anjou. Some one said of her that no woman equaled her in beauty,
  and few men surpassed her in courage and energy. It seemed as if she had been
  born in order to supply to her royal husband the qualities which he required
  in order to become a great king.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE STORY OF LADY NEVILLE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN reading the history of the English monarchy in these
  early times, you will often hear of the court intrigues which mingled with,
  and sometimes greatly complicated, the movement of public affairs. Margaret
  of Anjou found herself, on her arrival in England, involved in many such
  intrigues. Indeed, she was admirably qualified, by her sagacity and quickness
  of apprehension, and by the great ascendency which these and other qualities
  which she possessed gave her over the minds of all about her, to take a very
  active and successful part in the management of manoeuverings of all sorts.
  The nature of these court intrigues is very well illustrated by the narration
  which the most celebrated of Margaret's biographers gives of one in which he
  says that Margaret herself became involved while on her way from France to
  England. The story seems much more like romance than like reality. Indeed, it
  doubtless is a romance, but it nevertheless illustrates well the manner in
  which the private passions and personal and family quarrels of the great
  became involved with, and sometimes entirely controlled, the most important
  events in the national history, and therefore it will not be amiss to relate
  it.</p>

  <p>The first connection which Queen Margaret, as we are henceforth to call
  her, had with the affair of Lady Neville, took place at Abbeville, a town in
  France not very far from Calais, when the queen was advancing toward the
  sea-coast on her way to England. While she was at Abbeville, there suddenly
  appeared a young and beautiful lady who asked an audience of Margaret,
  announcing herself simply as one of the ladies who had been attached to the
  service of the dauphiness, who was the wife of the oldest son of the king,
  and who had recently died. She was admitted. She remained in private
  conversation with Margaret two hours, and when this mysterious interview was
  concluded she was introduced to the other ladies of Margaret's court as Miss
  Sanders, an English lady who had been attached to the court of the
  dauphiness, but who now, since the death of her mistress, wished to return to
  England in Margaret's train. Margaret informed the other ladies that she had
  received her into her household, and gave directions that she should be
  treated with the utmost consideration.</p>

  <p>The other ladies were very curious to solve the mystery of this case, but
  they could not obtain any clew to it. The stranger was very reserved; mingled
  very little with her new companions, and evinced a constant desire to avoid
  observation. There was something, however, in her beauty, and in the
  expression of deep and constant grief which her countenance wore, which made
  her an object of great interest to all the household of the queen, but they
  could not learn any particulars of her history. The facts, however, were
  these.</p>

  <p>Her real name was Anne Neville. She was the daughter of Richard Neville,
  Earl of Salisbury, one of the leading and most highly-connected noblemen in
  England. When she was about fifteen years old she was married to a relative
  of the family. The marriage, however, proved a very unhappy one. Her husband
  was very jealous of her. From her subsequent conduct it would seem probable
  that he might have had good reason to be so. At any rate, he was extremely
  jealous; and as he was of a harsh and cruel temper, he made his young wife
  very miserable by the exactions and privations which he enforced upon her,
  and by the violent invectives with which he continually assailed her.</p>

  <p>The incessant anxiety and suffering which these troubles occasioned soon
  began to prey upon the lady's health, and, at length, her father, observing
  that she was growing pale and thin, began to inquire into the cause. He soon
  learned what a dreadful life his daughter was leading. Like most of the other
  great nobles of those days, he was a man of violent character, and he
  immediately determined on rescuing his daughter from her husband's power, for
  he considered her husband as the party chiefly, if not wholly, to blame.</p>

  <p>He ascertained, or pretended to ascertain, that there had been some
  informalities connected with the marriage. His daughter was distantly related
  to her husband, and there were certain steps which it was necessary to take
  in such cases to obtain a dispensation from the Church, in order to render
  such marriage legal. These steps he now alleged had not been properly taken,
  and he immediately instituted proceedings to have the marriage annulled.
  Whether there was really any sufficient ground for such annulling, or whether
  he obtained the decree through influences which his high position enabled him
  to bring to bear upon the court, I do not know. He, however, succeeded in his
  purpose. The marriage was annulled, and his daughter returned home; and, in
  order to obliterate as far as possible all traces of the unhappy union into
  which she had been drawn, she dropped the name which she had received from
  her husband and resumed again her own maiden name.</p>

  <p>She now began soon to appear at court, where she almost immediately
  attracted great attention. On account of the peculiar circumstances in which
  she was placed, she enjoyed all the privileges of a widow, combined with the
  attractiveness and the charms of a lovely girl. Almost every body was ready
  to fall in love with her.</p>

  <p>Among her other admirers was the Duke of Somerset. He was a man of high
  rank and of great accomplishments, but he was married, and he could not,
  therefore, innocently make her the object of his love. He was not, however,
  deterred by this consideration, and he soon succeeded in making a strong
  impression upon Lady Neville's heart. They soon contrived means of meeting
  each other in private, resorting to all sorts of manoeuvres and inventions to
  aid them in keeping their guilty attachment to each other from the knowledge
  of those around them.</p>

  <p>In the mean while, the Duke of Gloucester himself, who was now, however,
  considerably advanced in life, lost his wife, she dying about this time, and
  he almost immediately conceived the idea of making Lady Neville her
  successor. He thought it not proper to say any thing to Lady Neville herself
  on this subject until some little time should have elapsed, but he spoke to
  her father, the Earl of Salisbury, who readily approved of the plan.
  Gloucester was at this time prime minister of England, and the lady whom he
  should choose for his wife would be elevated by her marriage to the highest
  pinnacle of grandeur. Of course, the importance and influence of her father
  also, and of all the members of her family, would be greatly increased by so
  splendid an alliance.</p>

  <p>So it was agreed that the match should be made, but the arrangement was to
  be kept secret, not only from the public, but from the intended bride
  herself; until a suitable time should have elapsed for the widower to recover
  from the grief which the death of his former wife was supposed to have
  occasioned him.</p>

  <p>At length, when the proper time for mourning had expired, Gloucester made
  his declaration of love. Lady Neville listened to it, thinking all the time
  what Somerset would say when she came to communicate the news to him. She did
  communicate it to him on the first opportunity.</p>

  <p>Great was the distress and the perplexity which the lovers felt while
  consulting together and determining what was to be done in such an emergency.
  They could not endure the thought of a separation. They could not be married
  to each other, for Somerset was married already. For Lady Neville to remain
  single all her life in order to be at liberty to indulge a guilty passion was
  an idea not to be entertained. They knew, too, that their present relations
  to each other could not long be continued. A thousand circumstances might
  happen at any time to interrupt or to terminate it, and it could not be long,
  in any event, before it must come to an end. So it was agreed between them
  that Lady Neville should accede to the great minister's proposal and become
  his wife. In the mean time, until the period should arrive for the
  consummation of the marriage, they were to renew and redouble their intimacy
  with each other, taking, however, every possible precaution to conceal their
  movements from the eyes of others.</p>

  <p>So the duke's offer was accepted, and it was soon made known to all the
  court that Lady Neville was his affianced bride.</p>

  <p>Thus far Lady Neville had treated the duke with great reserve in her
  accidental intercourse with him at the reunions of the court, but now, since
  he was her accepted lover, he thought he might reasonably expect a greater
  degree of cordiality in her demeanor toward him. But he found no change. She
  continued as formal and reserved as ever. Moreover, when he went to visit
  her, which he did sometimes several times a day, she was very often not at
  home&mdash;much too often, he thought. He went to the place where her
  domestics said she had gone in such cases, but she was very seldom to be
  found. He soon came to the conclusion that there was some strange mystery
  involved in the affair, and he determined to adopt effectual measures for
  unraveling it.</p>

  <p>So he employed certain trusty persons who were in his service to watch and
  see where Lady Neville went, and how she passed her time during these
  unaccountable absences from home. For many days this watch was continued, but
  no discoveries were made, The spies reported that they could not keep upon
  the lady's track. In spite of their best exertions she would contrive to
  elude them, and for several hours every day they lost sight of her
  altogether. They saw enough, however, to satisfy them that there was
  something wrong going on. What it was, however, they could not discover, so
  shrewd and complete were the precautions which Somerset and Lady Neville had
  taken to prevent detection.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Gloucester was for a time much perplexed to know what to do,
  whether openly to quarrel with Lady Neville and refuse to consummate the
  marriage, or to banish his suspicions and take her for his wife. His love for
  her finally triumphed, and he resolved to proceed with the marriage. He had
  no positive evidence against her, he said to himself and then, besides, even
  if there were some secret attachment on her part, to account for these
  mysterious appearances, she might, after, all, when once married to him, make
  him a faithful and affectionate wife. Some lingering remains of a former
  affection must often necessarily dwell, he thought, in the heart of a bride,
  even when truly and honestly giving herself to the one on whom her choice is
  finally made. Especially is this true in cases where the lady is young,
  accomplished, and lovely, while her husband can only offer wealth or high
  position instead of youth and personal attractions as a means of winning her
  favor.</p>

  <p>So it was decided that the marriage should take place, and the day for the
  wedding was appointed.</p>

  <p>When the time for the wedding drew nigh, and the lovers found that the
  period of their enjoyments was drawing to a close, they determined on having
  a farewell interview with each other on the day before the wedding, and in
  order to be safe from interruption, it was arranged that they should spend
  the day together in a village on the banks of the Thames, at some little
  distance from London.</p>

  <p>When the day came, Lady Neville left her home to repair to the place of
  rendezvous. She was followed by Gloucester's spies. She was received at the
  village by Somerset. Somerset was, however, so disguised that the spies did
  not know and could not discover who he was. They were satisfied, however,
  from his demeanor toward Lady Neville, that he was her lover, and they at
  once reported the facts to Gloucester in London.</p>

  <p>Gloucester was of course in a great rage. He swore terrible vengeance
  against both Lady Neville herself and her lover, whoever he might be. He at
  once armed a troop of his followers and rode off at the head of them, guided
  by one of the spies, to the village of rendezvous. It was dark before he
  arrived there. Some peasants of whom he made inquiry informed him that a lady
  answering to the description which he gave them had gone on board the boat to
  return to London some time before. Gloucester immediately turned, and made
  all haste back to London again, in hopes to reach the landing before the boat
  should arrive, with a full determination to kill both the lady herself and
  her paramour the moment they should touch the shore.</p>

  <p>He was mistaken, however, in supposing that the paramour, whoever he might
  be, was with the lady. Somerset, in the excess of his precaution, had
  returned to London by land, leaving Lady Neville to return by herself in the
  boat with the other passengers; for the boat was a sort of packet which plied
  regularly between the village and London. He, however, had stationed trusty
  persons not far from the landing in London, who were to receive Lady Neville
  on her arrival and convey her home.</p>

  <p>Gloucester arrived at the landing before the boat reached the shore. It
  was, however, now so dark that he despaired of being able to recognize the
  persons he was in pursuit of, especially under the disguise which he did not
  doubt that they would wear. So, in the recklessness of his rage, he resolved
  to kill every body in the boat, and thus to make sure of his revenge.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the moment that the boat touched the shore, he and his
  followers rushed on board and a dreadful scene of consternation and terror
  ensued. Gloucester himself made his way directly toward the figure of a lady,
  whose air, and manner, and style of dress indicated, so far as he could
  discern them in the darkness, that she was probably the object of his fury.
  He plunged his dagger into her breast. She, in an agony of terror, leaped
  into the river. She was buoyed up by her dress, and floated down the
  stream.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the work of murder on board the boat went on. The duke
  and his men continued stabbing and striking down all around them, until the
  passengers and the boat-men were every one killed. The bodies were then all
  thrown into the river, stones having been previously tied to them to make
  them sink.</p>

  <p>The people in the houses of the neighborhood, on the banks of the river,
  heard the cries, and raised their heads a moment from their pillows, or
  paused as they were walking along the silent streets to listen. But the cries
  were soon suppressed, for the massacre was the work of a few moments only,
  and such sounds were far too common in those days in the streets of London,
  and especially on the river, to attract much regard.</p>

  <p>The boat was of course covered with blood. The duke ordered his men to
  take it out into the middle of the river and sink it, that being the easiest
  and the quickest way of covering up all traces and proofs of the crime.</p>

  <p>The writer who relates this story says that Gloucester's reason for
  wishing to have his agency in this transaction concealed was not that he
  feared any punishment, for the laws in those days were wholly powerless to
  punish deeds of violence like this, committed by men of Gloucester's rank and
  station. He only thought that if it were known that he had murdered in this
  way so many innocent people, in order merely to make sure of killing an
  object of his own private jealousy and hate, it would injure his
  popularity!</p>

  <p>In the mean tithe, Lady Neville, for it was really Lady Neville whom
  Gloucester had stabbed, and who had leaped into the river, floated on down
  the stream, borne up by her dress, which was made, according to the fashion
  of the times, in a manner to give it great buoyancy in the water, by means of
  the hoops with which the sleeves of the robe were distended, and also from
  the form of the head-dress, which was very large and light, and well adapted
  to serve as a float to keep the head from sinking.</p>

    <p class="caption">Female Costume in the Time of Henry VI.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She floated on in this manner down the river until she had passed London
  Bridge, being carried through by the current under on of the arches. On
  emerging from the bridge, she came to the part of the river where the ships
  and other vessels bound down the river were moored. It happened that among
  other vessels lying at anchor in the stream was one bound to Normandy. The
  captain of this vessel had been on shore, but he was now coming off in his
  boat to go on board again. As the captain was looking out over the water by
  the light of a lantern which he held in his hand, to discern the way to his
  vessel, he saw something floating at a short distance from him which
  resembled the dress of a woman. He urged the boat forward in that direction.
  He succeeded, with great difficulty, after arriving at the spot, in getting
  the now almost lifeless form of Lady Neville on board his boat, and then
  rowed on as fast as possible to the vessel.</p>

  <p>Here every thing was done which the case required to restore the drowning
  lady to life. She soon recovered her senses, and looked about her wild with
  excitement and terror. She had the presence of mind, however, not to say a
  word that could betray her secret, though her dress, and her air and manner,
  convinced the captain that she was no ordinary personage. The wound was
  examined and found not to be serious. She had been protected by some portions
  of her dress which had turned the poniard aside. When she found that the
  immediate danger had passed she became more composed, and began to inquire in
  regard to the persons and scenes around her. When she found that the vessel
  which had received her was bound to Normandy, she determined to escape to
  that country; so she contrived means to induce the captain to conceal her on
  board until the time should arrive for setting sail, and then to take her
  with him down the river and across the Channel.</p>

  <p>On her arrival in France she repaired at once to the court of the
  dauphiness, who, being an English princess, was predisposed to take
  compassion upon her and to receive her kindly. She remained at this court, as
  we have seen, under the assumed name of Miss Sanders, until the death of the
  dauphiness. She was thus suddenly deprived of her protector in France, but
  almost at the same time the marriage of Margaret of Anjou seemed to open to
  her the means of returning to England.</p>

  <p>So long as the Duke of Gloucester lived and retained his power, she knew
  very well that she could not return in safety to the English court; but she
  thought that Margaret's going to England, would probably be the precursor of
  Gloucester's downfall.</p>

  <p>"She must hate him," said she to herself, "almost as much as I do, for he
  has opposed her marriage from the beginning, and has done all in his power to
  prevent it. Margaret will never be satisfied until she has deposed him from
  his power and put some friend of hers in his place. I can help her in this
  work, if she will receive me under her protection and allow me to accompany
  her to England."</p>

  <p>So she proceeded to Abbeville to intercept the queen on her way to the
  coast, as we have already seen. At the long and secret interview which she
  had with her there she related to Margaret the story of her connection with
  Somerset and with Gloucester, and of her almost miraculous escape from death
  at Gloucester's hands. She now wished for revenge; and if Queen Margaret
  would receive her into her service and take her to England, she would concert
  measures with Somerset, her lover, which would greatly aid Margaret in the
  plans which she might form for effecting the downfall of Gloucester.</p>

  <p>Margaret at once and very gladly acceded to this request, and took Lady
  Neville with her to England. She treated her with great consideration and
  honor; but still Lady Neville maintained a strict reserve in all her
  intercourse with the other ladies of the court, and kept herself in great
  seclusion, especially after the arrival of the bridal party in England. Her
  pretext for this was her deep affliction at the loss of her friend and
  patroness the Dauphiness of France. But the other ladies of the court were
  not wholly satisfied with this explanation. They were fully convinced that
  there was more in the case than met the view, especially when they found that
  on the arrival of the party in England the stranger seemed to take special
  pains to avoid meeting the Duke of Gloucester. They exerted all their powers
  of watchfulness and scrutiny to unravel the mystery, but in vain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; PLOTTINGS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was in this way that public affairs were mingled and
  complicated with private and personal intrigues in the English court at the
  time of Margaret's arrival in the country. Margaret was of a character which
  admirably fitted her to act her part well in the management of such
  intrigues, and in playing off the passions of ambition, love, resentment,
  envy, and hate, as manifested by those around her&mdash;passions which always
  glow and rage with greater fury in a court than in any other
  community&mdash;so as to accomplish her ends. She was very young indeed, but
  she had arrived at a maturity, both mental and personal, far beyond her
  years. Her countenance was beautiful, and her air and manner possessed an
  inexpressible charm, but her mental powers were of a very masculine
  character, and in the boldness of the plans which she formed, and in the
  mingled shrewdness and energy with which she went on to the execution of
  them, she evinced less the qualities of a woman than of a man.</p>

  <p>It was supposed by all parties in England that Lady Neville was dead. Of
  course the Duke of Gloucester had no idea that any one could have escaped
  from the boat. He supposed that he had effected the complete destruction of
  all on board of it. Somerset's men, who had been stationed at some distance
  from the landing to receive Lady Neville and convey her home, waited until
  long past the appointed hour, but no one came. The inquiries which Somerset
  made secretly the next day showed that the boat had sailed from the village,
  but no tidings of her arrival in London could be obtained, and he supposed
  that she must have been lost, with all on board, by some accident on the
  river. As for the Earl of Salisbury, Lady Neville's father, Gloucester went
  to him at once, and informed him what he had done. He had detected his
  daughter, he said, in a guilty intrigue, which, if it had been made public,
  would have brought not only herself, but all her family, to shame. The earl,
  who was a man of great sternness and severity of character, said that
  Gloucester had done perfectly right, and they agreed together to keep the
  whole transaction secret from the world, and to circulate a report that Lady
  Neville had died from some natural cause.</p>

  <p>Such was the state of things when Margaret and Lady Neville arrived in
  London. As soon as the queen became somewhat established in her new home, she
  began to revolve in her mind the means of deposing Gloucester. Her plan was
  first to endeavor to arouse her husband from his lethargy, and to awaken in
  his mind something like a spirit of independence and a feeling of
  ambition.</p>

  <p>"You have in your hands," she used to say to him, "what may be easily made
  the foundation of the noblest realm in Europe. Besides Great Britain, you
  have the whole of Normandy, and other valuable possessions in France, which
  together form a vast kingdom, the government of which you might acquire great
  glory, if you would take the government of it into your own hands."</p>

  <p>She went on to represent to him how unworthy it was of him to allow all
  the power of such a realm to be wielded by his uncle, instead of assuming the
  command at once himself, as every consideration of prudence and policy urged
  him to do. A great many instances had occurred in English history, she said,
  in which a favorite minister had been allowed to hold power so long, and to
  strengthen himself in the possession of it so completely, that he could not
  be divested of it, so that the king himself came at length to be held in
  subjection by his own minister. The Duke of Gloucester was advancing rapidly
  in the same course; and, unless the king aroused himself from his inaction,
  and took the government into his own hands, he would soon lose all power to
  do it, and would sink into a condition of humiliating dependence upon one of
  his own subjects.</p>

  <p>Then, again, she urged upon him at other times the example of his father
  and grandfather, Henry IV. and Henry V., whose reigns, through the personal
  energy and prowess which they had exhibited in strengthening and extending
  their dominions, had given them a world-wide renown. It would be extremely
  inglorious for the descendant of such a line to spend his life in spiritless
  inactivity, and to leave the affairs of his kingdom in the hands of a
  relative, who of course could only be expected to exercise his powers for the
  purpose of promoting his own interest and glory.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she reminded him of a danger that he was in from the
  representations of other branches of the royal line who still claimed the
  throne, and might at any time, whenever an opportunity offered, be expected
  to attempt to enforce their claims. As will be seen by the genealogical
  table, Lionel, the second son of Edward III.&mdash;whose immediate
  descendants had been superseded by those of John of Gaunt, the third son, on
  account of the fact that the only child of Lionel was a daughter, and she had
  been unable to make good her claims&mdash;had a great-granddaughter, named
  Anne, who married Richard, a son of Edmund, the fourth of the sons of Edward
  III.</p>

  <p>Richard Plantagenet, who issued from this union, was, of course, the
  descendant and heir of Lionel. He had also other claims to the throne, and
  Margaret reminded her husband that there was danger at any time that he might
  come forward and assert his claims.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, it was evident, said she, that the king could
  not consider his interests safe in the care of any person whatsoever out of
  his own immediate family&mdash;that is, in any one's hands but his own and
  those of his wife. A minister, however strong his professions of fidelity and
  attachment might be, could not be depended upon. If another dynasty offered
  him more advantageous terms, there was not, and there could not be, any
  security against his changing sides; whereas a wife, whose interests were
  bound up inseparably with those of her husband, might be relied upon with
  absolute certainty to be faithful and true to her husband in every
  conceivable emergency.</p>

  <p>These representations which Margaret made to her husband from time to
  time, as she had opportunity, produced a very considerable impression upon
  him. Still he seemed not to have resolution and energy enough to act in
  accordance with them. He said that he did not see how he could take away from
  his uncle a power which he had always exercised well and faithfully. And
  then, besides, he himself had not the age and experience necessary for the
  successful management of the affairs of so mighty a kingdom. If he were to
  undertake the duties of government, he was convinced that he should make
  mistakes, and so get into difficulty. Margaret, however, clearly perceived
  that she was making progress in producing an impression upon her husband's
  mind. To increase the influence of her representations, she watched for
  occasions in which Gloucester differed in opinion from the king, and failed
  to carry out suggestions or recommendations which the king had made, relating
  probably, in most cases, to appointments to office about the court. Some say
  she created these occasions by artfully inducing her husband to make
  recommendations which she knew the duke would not sanction. At all events,
  such cases occurred, and Margaret took advantage of them to urge her views
  still more upon Henry's mind.</p>

  <p>"How humiliating," said she, "that a great monarch should be dependent
  upon one of his subjects for permission to do this or that, when he might
  have all his affairs under his own absolute control!"</p>

  <p>But Henry, in reply to this, said that it was not in human nature to
  escape mistakes, and he thought he was very fortunate in having a minister
  who, when he was in danger of making them, could interpose and save him from
  the ill consequences which would otherwise result from his errors.</p>

  <p>To this Margaret rejoined that it was indeed true that human nature was
  liable to err, but that it was very humiliating for a great and powerful
  sovereign to have public attention called to his errors by having them
  corrected in that manner by an inferior, and to be restricted in the exercise
  of his powers by a tutor and a governor, in order to keep him from doing
  wrong, as if he were a child not competent to act for himself.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she added, "if you would really take the charge of your affairs
  into your own hands and act independently, what you call your errors you may
  depend upon it the public would designate by a different and a softer name.
  The world is always disposed to consider what is done by a great and powerful
  monarch as of course right, and even when it would seem to them wrong they
  believe that its having that appearance is only because they are not in a
  position to form a just judgment on the question, not being fully acquainted
  with the facts, or not seeing all the bearings of them."</p>

  <p>She assured her husband, moreover, that if he would take the business of
  the government into his own hands, he would be very successful in his
  administration of public affairs, and would be well sustained by all the
  people of the realm.</p>

  <p>Besides thus operating upon the mind of the king, Margaret was secretly
  employed all the time in ascertaining the views and feelings of the principal
  nobles and other great personages of the realm, with a view to learning who
  were disposed to feel hostile to the duke, and to unite all such into an
  organized opposition to him. One of the first persons to whom she applied
  with this view was Somerset, the former lover of Lady Neville.</p>

  <p>She presumed, of course, that Somerset would be predisposed to a feeling
  of hostility to the duke on account of the old rivalry which had existed
  between them, and she now proposed to make use of Lady Neville's return, and
  of her agency in restoring her to him, as a means of inducing him to enter
  fully into her plans for overturning his old rival's power. In order to
  retain the management of the affair wholly in her own hands, she agreed with
  Lady Neville that Lady Neville herself was not in any way to communicate with
  Somerset until she, the queen, had first had an interview with him, and that
  he was to learn the safety of Lady Neville only through her. Lady Neville
  readily consented to this, believing that the queen could manage the matter
  better than she herself could do it.</p>

  <p>It will be recollected that Somerset was married during the period of his
  former acquaintance with Lady Neville, but his wife had died while Lady
  Neville was in France, and he was now free; so that the plan which the queen
  and lady Neville now formed was to give him an opportunity, if he still
  retained his love for her, to make her his wife.</p>

  <p>In the prosecution of her design, the queen made arrangements for a secret
  interview with Somerset, and in the interview informed him that Lady Neville
  was still alive and well; that she was, moreover, not far away, and it was in
  the queen's power to restore her to him if he desired again to see her, and
  that she would do so on certain conditions.</p>

  <p>Somerset was overjoyed at hearing this news. At first he could not be
  persuaded that it was true; and when assured positively that it was so, and
  that the long lost Lady Neville was alive and well, and in England, he was in
  a fever of impatience to see her again. He would agree to any conditions, he
  said, that the queen might name, as the price of having her restored to him.
  The queen said that the conditions were three.</p>

  <p>The first was that he was to see her but once, and that only for a few
  minutes, in order that he might be convinced that she was really alive, and
  then was to leave her and not to see her again until the Duke of Gloucester
  had fallen from power.</p>

  <p>The second was that he should pretend to be not on good terms with the
  queen herself, in order to avert suspicion in respect to some of her schemes
  until such time as she should be ready to receive him again into favor.</p>

  <p>The third was that he should do all he could to increase and strengthen
  the party against the duke, by turning as many as possible of his friends,
  and those over whom he had any influence, against him, and then finally, when
  the party should become sufficiently strong, to prefer charges against him in
  Parliament, and bring him to trial.</p>

  <p>Somerset at once agreed to all these conditions, and the queen then
  admitted him to an interview with Lady Neville.</p>

  <p>He was overwhelmed with transports of love and joy at once more beholding
  her and pressing her in his arms. The queen, who was present, was very much
  interested in witnessing the proofs of the ardor of the affection by which
  the lovers were still bound to each other, but she soon interrupted their
  expressions and demonstrations of delight by calling Somerset's attention to
  the steps which were next to be taken to further their plans.</p>

  <p>"The first thing to be done," said she, "is for you to see the Earl of
  Salisbury and ask the hand of his daughter, and at the same time endeavor to
  induce him to join our party."</p>

  <p>The Earl of Salisbury had a son, the brother, of course, of Lady Neville,
  whose title was the Earl of Warwick. He was the celebrated king-maker, so
  called, referred to in a former chapter. He received that title on account of
  the great influence which he subsequently exercised in raising up and putting
  down one after another of the two great dynasties. His power was at this time
  very great, partly on account of his immense wealth, and partly on account of
  his commanding personal character. Margaret was extremely desirous of
  bringing him over to her side.</p>

  <p>Somerset readily undertook the duty of communicating with the Earl of
  Salisbury, with a view, of informing him of his daughter's safety and asking
  her hand, and at the same time of ascertaining what hope there might be of
  drawing him into the combination which the queen was forming against the Duke
  of Gloucester.</p>

  <p>Somerset accordingly sought an interview with Salisbury, and told him that
  the report which had been circulated that his daughter was dead was not
  true&mdash;that she was still alive&mdash;that, instead of having been
  drowned in the Thames, as had been supposed, she had made her escape to
  France, where she had since lived under the protection of the dauphiness.</p>

  <p>He was, of course, not willing to make known the real circumstances of the
  case in respect to the cause of her flight, and so he represented to the earl
  that the reason why she left the country was to escape the marriage with
  Gloucester, which would have been extremely disagreeable to her. She had now,
  however, returned, and he was commissioned by her to ask the earl's
  forgiveness for what had passed, and his consent that he himself&mdash;that
  is, Somerset, who had always been strongly attached to her, and who now, by
  the death of his former wife, was free, should be united to her in
  marriage.</p>

  <p>If Somerset had succeeded in this part of his mission, he was then
  intending, when the old earl's love for his daughter should have been
  reawakened in his bosom by the joyful news that she was alive, and by the
  prospect of a brilliant marriage for her, to introduce the subject of the
  Duke of Gloucester, and perhaps cautiously reveal to him the true state of
  the case in respect to the murderous violence with which the duke had
  assailed his daughter, and which was the true cause of her flight. But the
  earl did not give him any opportunity to approach the second part of his
  commission. After having heard the statement which Somerset made to him in
  respect to his daughter, he broke out in a furious rage against her. He
  called her by the most opprobrious names. He had full proof of her dishonor,
  and he would have nothing more to do with her. He had disinherited her, and
  given all her share of the family property to her brother; and the only
  reason why he ever wished her to come into his sight again was that he might
  with a surer blow inflict upon her the punishment which Gloucester had
  designed for her.</p>

  <p>Somerset saw at once that the case was hopeless, and he withdrew.</p>

  <p>Thus the attempt to draw Salisbury into the conspiracy against the duke
  seemed for the time to fail. But Margaret was not at all discouraged. She
  pushed her manoeuvres and intrigues in other quarters with so much diligence
  and success that, in about two years after her arrival in England, she found
  her party large enough and strong enough for action.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE FALL OF GLOUCESTER</h2>

  <p class="first">AT length the time arrived when Margaret considered her
  schemes ripe for execution.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, one day, while Henry and herself were together in the king's
  cabinet engaged in transacting some public affairs, Margaret made some excuse
  for sending for Gloucester, and while Gloucester was in the cabinet,
  Somerset, according to a preconcerted arrangement, presented himself at the
  door with an air of excitement and alarm, and asked to be admitted. He wished
  to see the king on business of the utmost urgency. He was allowed to come in.
  He had a paper in his hand, and his countenance, as well as his air and
  manner, denoted great apprehension and anxiety. As soon, however, as he saw
  the Duke of Gloucester, he seemed surprised and embarrassed, and was about to
  retire, saying he had supposed that the king and queen were alone.</p>

  <p>But Margaret would not allow him to withdraw.</p>

  <p>"Stay," said she, "and let us know what the business is that seems so
  urgent. You can speak freely. There is no one here beside ourselves except
  the minister of the king, and there is nothing to be concealed from him."</p>

  <p>Somerset, on hearing these words, paused for a moment, looked at
  Gloucester, seemed irresolute, and then, as if nerving himself to a great
  effort, he advanced resolutely and presented the paper which he had in his
  hands to the king, saying, at the same time, in a very solemn manner, that it
  contained charges of the gravest character against Gloucester; and he added
  that, on the whole, he was not sorry that the accused person was present to
  know what was laid to his charge, and to reply if he had any proper
  justification to offer.</p>

  <p>The duke seemed thunderstruck. The king, too, was extremely surprised, and
  began to look greatly embarrassed. Margaret put an end to the awkward
  suspense by taking the paper from the king's hand, and opening it in order to
  read it.</p>

  <p>"Let us see," said she, "what these charges are."</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401651h-images/Margaret-11.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The Charges against Gloucester</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>So she opened the paper and began to read it. The charges were numerous.
  The principal one related to some transactions in respect to the English
  dominions on the Continent, in which Gloucester was accused of having
  sacrificed the rights and interests of the crown in order to promote certain
  private ends of his own. There were a great many other accusations, relating
  to alleged usurpations of the prerogative of the king and high-handed
  violations of the laws of the land. Among these last the murder of Lady
  Neville was specified, and the deed was characterized in the severest terms
  as a crime of the deepest dye, and one committed under circumstances of great
  atrocity, although the author of the charges admitted that the details of the
  affair were not fully known.</p>

  <p>As Margaret read these accusations one after another, the duke affirmed
  positively of each one that it was wholly unjust. He seemed for a moment
  surprised and confused when the murder of Lady Neville was laid to his
  charge, but he soon recovered himself, and declared that he was innocent of
  this crime as well as of all the others. The whole series of accusations was
  a tissue of base calumnies, he said, from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>Margaret read the paper through, parsing only from time to time to hear
  what Gloucester had to say whenever he manifested a desire to speak, but
  without making any observations of her own. She assumed, in fact, the air and
  manner of an unconcerned and indifferent witness. After she had finished
  reading the paper she folded it up and laid it aside, saying at the same time
  to the king that those were very grave and weighty charges, and it would be
  very unjust to the duke to receive them against his positive declarations of
  his innocence, without the most clear and conclusive proof.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," she added, "they ought not to be lightly laid aside
  without investigation. We can not suppose that the Duke of Somerset can have
  made such charges without any evidence whatever to sustain them."</p>

  <p>The Duke of Somerset said immediately that he was prepared with full proof
  of all the charges, and he was ready to offer the evidence in respect to any
  one or all of them whenever his majesty should require it.</p>

  <p>Margaret then opened the paper, and, looking over the list of charges
  again with a careless air, at last, as if accidentally, fixed upon the one
  relating to the murder of Lady Neville.</p>

  <p>"What proofs have you in respect to this atrocious murder that you have
  charged against the duke?"</p>

  <p>Gloucester felt for the moment much relieved at finding that this was the
  charge selected first for proof; for so effectual had been the precautions
  which he had taken to conceal his crime in this case, that he was confident
  that, instead of any substantial evidence against him, there could be, at
  worst, only vague grounds of suspicion, and these he was confident he could
  easily show were insufficient to establish so serious a charge.</p>

  <p>Somerset asked permission to retire for a few moments. Very soon he
  returned, bringing in with him Lady Neville herself. An actual resurrection
  from the dead could not have astounded Gloucester more than this apparition.
  He was overwhelmed with amazement and almost with terror. Lady Neville
  advanced to the king, and, falling upon her knees before him, she related the
  circumstances of the assault made by Gloucester upon the boat in the Thames,
  of the cruel murder of the passengers and boatmen, of the wound inflicted
  upon herself by the dagger of the duke, and the almost miraculous manner in
  which she made her escape.</p>

  <p>The duke, overwhelmed by the emotions which such a scene might have been
  expected to produce upon his mind, seemed to admit that what Lady Neville
  said was true. At least he could not deny it, and his confusion and distress
  amounted apparently to a virtual confession of guilt. Margaret, however, soon
  interrupted the proceeding by saying to the king that the case was plainly
  too serious to be disposed of in so private and informal a manner. It was for
  the Parliament to consider it, she said, and decide what was to be done; and
  measures ought at once to be taken for bringing it before them.</p>

  <p>So Gloucester and Somerset were both dismissed from the royal presence,
  leaving the king in a state of great distress and perplexity.</p>

  <p>Such is the story of the private manoeuvres resorted to by Margaret with a
  view to destroying the hold which the Duke of Gloucester had upon the mind of
  the king, preparatory to more widely-extended plans for ruining him with the
  Parliament and the nation, which is told by one of her most celebrated
  biographers. Whether there was or was not any foundation for this particular
  story, there is no doubt but that she exercised all her ingenuity and talent
  as a manoeuvrer to accomplish her object, and that she succeeded. The king
  was brought over to her views, and so strong a party was formed against
  Gloucester among the nobles and other influential personages in the land,
  that at length, in 1447, a Parliament was summoned with a view of bringing
  the affair to a crisis.</p>

  <p>Nothing, however, was said, in calling the Parliament, of the great and
  exciting business which was to be brought before them. So great was the power
  of such a man as Gloucester, that any open attempt to arrest him would have
  been likely to have been met with armed resistance, and might have led at
  once to civil war.</p>

  <p>One of the charges against him was that he was intriguing with the Duke of
  York, the representative and heir of the two other branches of old King
  Edward the Third's family, who has already been mentioned as claiming the
  throne. It was said that Gloucester was secretly plotting with Richard, with
  a view of deposing Henry, and raising Richard to the throne in his stead.</p>

  <p>The question of the succession was really, at this time, in a very curious
  state. The Duke of Gloucester himself was Henry's heir in case he should die
  without children; for Gloucester was Henry's oldest uncle, and, of course, in
  default of his descendants, the crown would go back to him. This was one
  reason, perhaps, why he had opposed Henry's marriage.</p>

  <p>So long, therefore, as Henry remained unmarried, it was for Gloucester's
  interest to maintain the rights of his branch of the family&mdash;that is,
  the Lancaster line&mdash;against the claims of the house of York. But in case
  Henry should have children, then he would be cut off from the succession on
  the Lancaster side, and then it might be for his interest to espouse the
  cause of the house of York, provided he could make better terms in respect to
  his own position and the rewards which he was to receive for his services on
  that side than on the other.</p>

  <p>Now Henry was married, and, moreover, it had long been evident to
  Gloucester that his own influence was fast declining. The scene in the king's
  cabinet, when Somerset brought those charges against him, must have greatly
  increased his fears in respect to the continuance of his power under Henry's
  government. Still, if it was true that he was contemplating making common
  cause with the Duke of York, he had not yet so far matured his plans as to
  make any open change in his course of conduct.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when the plan of calling a Parliament was determined by the
  king and Margaret, every effort was made to keep it a secret from the public
  that the case of Gloucester was to be brought before it. It was summoned on
  other pretexts. The place of meeting was not, as usual, at London, for
  Gloucester was so great a favorite with the people of London that it was
  thought that, if it were to be attempted to arrest him there, he would
  certainly resist and attempt to raise an insurrection.</p>

  <p>The Parliament was accordingly summoned to meet at Bury St.
  Edmund's&mdash;a town situated about fifty or sixty miles to the northeast of
  London, where there was a celebrated abbey. The English Parliament was in
  those days, as it is, in fact, in theory now, nothing more nor less than a
  convocation of the leading personages of the realm, called by the king, in
  order that they might give the monarch their counsel or aid in any emergency
  that might arise, and he could call them to attend him at any place within
  the kingdom that he chose to designate.</p>

  <p>While thus, by summoning Parliament to meet at Bury St. Edmund's, the
  queen's party placed themselves beyond the reach of the friends and adherents
  of Gloucester, who were very numerous in and around the capital, they took
  care to have a strong force there on their own side, ready to do whatever
  might be required of them.</p>

  <p>When the appointed day arrived the Parliament assembled. It met in the
  abbey. The great dining-hall of the abbey, or the refectory, as it was
  called, the room in which the monks were accustomed to take their meals, was
  fitted up for their reception. On the first day some ordinary business was
  transacted, and on the second, suddenly, and without any previous warning,
  the duke was arrested by the public officer, who was attended and aided in
  this service by a strong force, and immediately taken away to the Tower.</p>

  <p>This event, of course, produced great excitement. The news of it spread
  rapidly throughout the kingdom, and it awakened universal astonishment and
  alarm.</p>

  <p>It was expected that charges would be immediately brought against him, and
  that he would be at once arraigned for trial. But the excitement which the
  affair had created was increased to a ten-fold degree by the tidings which
  ware circulated a few days afterward that he was dead. The story was that he
  was found dead one morning in his prison. People, however, were slow to
  believe this statement. They thought that he had been poisoned, or put to
  death in some other violent manner. The officers of the government declared
  that it was not so; and, in order to convince the people that the duke had
  died a natural death, they caused the body to be exposed to public view for
  several days before they allowed it to be interred, in order that all might
  see that it bore no marks of violence.</p>

  <p>The people were, however, not satisfied. They thought that there were many
  ways by which death might be produced without leaving any outward indications
  of violence upon the person. They persisted in believing that their favorite
  had been murdered.</p>

  <p>One account which was given of the mode of death was that Somerset went to
  visit him in his prison in the Tower, in order to see whether he could not
  come to some terms with him, but that Gloucester rejected his advances with
  so much pride and scorn that a furious altercation arose, in the course of
  which Somerset, with the assistance of men whom he had brought with him,
  strangled or suffocated the unhappy prisoner on his couch, and then, after
  arranging his limbs and closing his eyes, so as to give him the appearance of
  being in a state of slumber, his murderers went away and left him, to be
  found in that condition by the jailer when he should come to bring him his
  food.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE FALL OF SUFFOLK</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER the death of the Duke of Gloucester, Queen Margaret
  was plunged in a perfect sea of plots, schemes, manoeuvres, and machinations
  of all sorts, which it would take a volume fully to unravel. This state of
  things continued for two years, during which time she became more and more
  involved in the difficulties and complications which surrounded her, until at
  last she found herself in very serious trouble. I can only here briefly
  allude to the more prominent sources of her perplexity.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the people of England were very seriously displeased
  at the treatment which Gloucester had received. They would not believe that
  he died a natural death, and the impression gained ground very generally that
  the queen was the cause of his being murdered. They did not suppose that she
  literally ordered him to be put to death, but that she gave hints or
  intimations, as, royal personages were accustomed to do in such cases in
  those days, on which some zealous and unscrupulous follower ventured to act,
  certain of pleasing her. As Gloucester had been a general favorite with the
  nation, these rumors and suspicions tended greatly to alienate the hearts of
  the people from the queen. Many began to hate her. They called her the French
  woman, and vented their ill-will in obscure threats and mutterings.</p>

  <p>This feeling of hostility to the queen was increased by the very
  unfortunate turn that things were taking in France about this time. The
  provinces of Maine and Anjou lay directly to the south of Normandy, which
  last was the most valuable of the possessions which the English crown held in
  France, and these two provinces had been given up to the French at the time
  of Margaret's marriage. It was only on condition that the English would give
  them up that Lord Suffolk could induce Margaret's father to consent to the
  match. Suffolk was extremely unwilling to surrender these provinces. He knew
  that the English nobles and people would be very much dissatisfied as soon as
  they learned that it was done, and he feared that he might at some future day
  be called to account for having been concerned in the transaction. But the
  king was so deeply in love with Margaret that he insisted on Suffolk's
  complying with the terms which were exacted by her friends, and the provinces
  were ceded.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York was regent in France at that time, but Margaret felt some
  uneasiness in respect to his position there. He was the representative and
  heir of the rival line; and while it was for her interest to give him
  prominence enough under Henry's government to prevent his growing
  discontented and desperate, it was not good policy to exalt him to too high a
  position. She was accordingly somewhat at a loss to decide what to do.</p>

  <p>Soon after the death of Gloucester, Somerset, finding that he was an
  object of suspicion, felt himself to be in danger, and he proposed to
  Margaret that he should retire into Normandy for a time. Margaret suggested
  that he should take the regency of Normandy in the Duke of York's stead. To
  this he finally consented. The Duke of York was recalled, and Somerset went
  to take command of Normandy in his stead.</p>

  <p>At the time that Suffolk negotiated the marriage contract between Henry
  and Margaret, a truce had been made with the King of France, as has already
  been stated. Suffolk intended and hoped to conclude a permanent peace, but he
  could not succeed in accomplishing this. The King of France, as soon as the
  marriage was fairly carried into effect, seemed bent on renewing hostilities,
  and as he had now the territories of Maine and Anjou in his possession, with
  all the castles and fortresses which provinces contained, he could advance to
  the frontiers of Normandy on that side with facility, and organize
  expeditions for invading the country in the most effective manner.</p>

  <p>He now only wanted a pretext, and a pretext in such cases is always soon
  found. A certain company of soldiers, who had been dismissed from some place
  in Maine in consequence of the cession of that province to France, instead of
  going across the frontier into Normandy to join the English forces there, as
  they ought to have done, went into Brittany, another French province near,
  and there organized themselves into a sort of band of robbers, and committed
  acts of plunder. The King of France complained of this to Somerset, for this
  was after Somerset had assumed the command as regent, or governor of
  Normandy. Somerset admitted the facts, and proposed to pay damages. The king
  named a sum so great that Somerset could not or would not pay it, and so war
  was again declared.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In consequence of the advantages which the King of France enjoyed in
  having possession of Maine, he could organize his invading army in a very
  effective manner. He crossed the frontier in great force, and after taking a
  number of towns and castles, and defeating the English army in several
  battles, he at last drove Somerset into Rouen, the capital of the
  province&mdash;a very ancient and remarkable town&mdash;and shut him up
  there.</p>

  <p>After a short siege Rouen was compelled to capitulate, and, besides giving
  up Rouen, Somerset was obliged to surrender several other important castles
  and towns in order to obtain his own liberty.</p>

  <p>Things went on in this way during the year 1449, from bad to worse, until
  finally the whole of Normandy was lost. The town of Cherbourg, which has
  lately become so renowned on account of the immense naval and military works
  which have been constructed there, was the last retreat and refuge of the
  English, and even from this they were finally expelled.</p>

  <p>The people of England were in a great rage. The principal object of their
  resentment was Lord Suffolk, who was now the first minister and the
  acknowledged head of the government. During the progress of the difficulties
  with Gloucester, Margaret had kept him a great deal in the background, in
  order that the public might not associate him with those transactions, nor
  hold him in any way responsible for them, though there was no doubt that he
  was the queen's confidential friend and counselor through the whole. After
  the death of Gloucester he had been gradually brought forward, and he had
  now, for some time, been the acknowledged minister of the crown, and as such
  responsible, according to the theory of the British Constitution and to the
  ideas of English- men, for every thing that was done, and especially for
  every thing like misfortune and disaster which occurred.</p>

  <p>There was, of course, a great outcry raised against Suffolk, and also,
  more covertly, against the queen, who had brought Suffolk into power. All the
  mischief originated, too, people said, in the luckless marriage of Margaret
  to the king, and the cession of Maine and Anjou to the French as the price of
  it. The French would never have been able to have penetrated into Normandy
  had it not been for the advantage they gained in the possession of those
  provinces on the frontier.</p>

    <p class="caption">View of Bordeaux</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>There were still large possessions held by the English in the southwestern
  part of France on the Garonne. The capital of this territory, which was the
  celebrated province of Guienne, was Bordeaux, a large and important city in
  those days as now. It stands on the bank of the river where it begins to
  widen toward the sea, and thus it was accessible to the English in their
  ships as well as when coming with their armies by land. It was a place of
  great strength as well as of commanding position, being provided with castles
  and towers to defend it from the landward side, and thick walls and powerful
  batteries along the margin of the water.</p>

  <p>Suffolk did all in his power to raise and send off re-enforcements to the
  army in Guienne, but it was in vain. The English were driven out of one town
  and castle after another, until, at last, Bordeaux itself fell, and all was
  lost.</p>

  <p>The resentment and rage of the people of England now knew no bounds.
  Suffolk was universally denounced as the author of all these dire calamities.
  Lampoons and satires were written against him; he was hooted sometimes by the
  populace of London when he appeared in the streets, and every thing portended
  a gathering storm. At length, in the fall of 1449, a Parliament was summoned.
  When it was convened, Suffolk appeared in the House of Lords as usual, and,
  rising in his place, he called the attention of the peers to the angry and
  vindictive denunciations which were daily heaped upon him by the public,
  declaring that he was wholly ignorant of the crimes which were laid to his
  charge, and challenging his enemies to bring forward any proof to sustain
  their accusations.</p>

  <p>A spirit of bold defiance like this might have been successful in some
  cases, perhaps, in driving back the tide of hostility and hate which was
  rising so rapidly, but in this instance it seemed to have the contrary
  effect. The enemies of Suffolk in the House of Commons took up the challenge
  at once. They were strong enough to carry the house with them. They passed an
  address to the peers, requesting them to cause Suffolk to be arrested and
  imprisoned. They would, they said, immediately bring forward the proofs of
  his guilt.</p>

  <p>The Lords replied that they could not arrest and imprison one of their
  number except upon specific charges made against him. Where upon the Commons
  very promptly prepared a list of charges and sent them to the Lords. On this
  accusation the Lords ordered Suffolk to be arrested, and he was sent to the
  Tower.</p>

  <p>During the two months that succeeded his arrest his enemies were busily
  engaged in preparing the bill of impeachment against him in form, and
  collecting the evidence by which they were to sustain it, while the queen was
  equally earnest and anxious in the work of contriving means to save him. She
  visited him secretly, it is said, in his prison, and conferred with him on
  the plan to be pursued. They seem to have been both convinced that it was
  impossible for him to remain in England and ride out the storm. The only
  course of safety would be for him to leave the country for a while, provided
  the means could be devised of getting him away. What the plan was which they
  agreed upon for accomplishing this purpose will appear in the sequel.</p>

  <p>At length, on the thirteenth of March; he was summoned before the House of
  Lords, and the bill of impeachment was brought forward. There were a great
  many charges, beginning with that of having wickedly and with corrupt motives
  surrendered, and so lost forever to the crown, the provinces of Maine and
  Anjou, and going on to numerous accusations of malfeasance in office; of
  encroachments on the prerogatives of the king, and of acts in which the
  interest and honor of the country had been sacrificed to his own personal
  ambition or private ends. Suffolk defended himself in a general speech,
  without, however, demanding, as he was entitled to do, a formal trial by his
  peers. These proceedings occupied several days&mdash;as long as any lingering
  hope remained in Suffolk's mind of his being able to stem the torrent. At
  length, however, on the seventeenth of March, finding that the pressure
  against him was continually increasing; and that there would be no chance of
  an acquittal if he were to claim a trial, he appealed to the king to decide
  his case, saying that, though he was entirely innocent of the crimes charged
  against him, he would submit himself entirely to his majesty's will.</p>

  <p>In response to this appeal; the king declared, through the proper officer,
  in the House of Lords, that he would not decide upon the question of the
  guilt or innocence of the accused, since he had not demanded a trial, but he
  thought it best, under all the circumstances of the case, that Suffolk should
  leave the country. He therefore issued a decree of banishment against him for
  five years. He was required to leave England before the first of May, and not
  to put his foot upon any English soil until the five years were expired.</p>

  <p>The Lords were much displeased at having the affair thus taken out of
  their hands. They made a formal protest against this decision, but they could
  do nothing more. The people, too, were very much enraged. They declared that
  Suffolk should never leave London alive; and on the day when they expected
  that he was to be taken from the Tower to be conveyed to France, a mob of two
  thousand men collected in the streets, resolved to kill him.</p>

  <p>But the queen devised means for enabling him to evade them. Some of his
  servants and followers were seized, but he succeeded in making his escape,
  and; after going to his castle in the country, and making some hurried
  arrangements there, he went down to the sea-coast at Ipswich, a town in the
  eastern part of the island, and there embarked for France in a vessel which
  the queen had taken the precaution to have ready there for him.</p>

  <p>The vessel immediately sailed, steering to the southward, of course,
  toward the Straits of Dover. As she was passing through the Straits, between
  Dover and Calais, a man-of-war named the Nicholas of the Tower, hove in
  sight, coming up to the vessel just as they were sending a boat on shore at
  Calais to inquire whether Suffolk would be allowed to land there. The boat
  was intercepted. At the same time, a boat from the man-of-war came on board
  the vessel, bringing officers who were instructed to search her thoroughly.
  Of course, they found Suffolk on board, and the officer, as soon as Suffolk
  was discovered, informed him that he must go with him on board the
  man-of-war.</p>

  <p>Suffolk had no alternative but to obey. The captain of the man-of-war
  received him, as he stepped upon the deck, with the words, I am glad to see
  you, traitor, or something to that effect. Such a salutation must have
  plainly indicated to Suffolk what was before him. The man-of-war moved toward
  the English shore, and began to make signals to some parties on the land. She
  remained there for two days, exchanging signals in this way from time to
  time, and apparently awaiting orders.</p>

  <p>At length, on the third day, a boat came off from the shore, provided with
  every thing that was necessary for the execution of a criminal. There was a
  platform with a block upon it, an axe, or cleaver of some sort, and an
  executioner. Suffolk was conveyed on board the boat, and there, with very
  little ceremony, his head was laid upon the block, and the executioner
  immediately commenced his task of severing it from the body. But, either from
  the unsteadiness of the boat, or the unsuitableness of the instrument, or the
  clumsiness of the operator, five several blows were required before the
  bloody deed was done.</p>

  <p>The boat immediately proceeded to the shore. The men on board threw out
  the dissevered remains upon the beach, and then went away.</p>

  <p>Some friends of Suffolk, hearing what had been done, came down to the
  beach, and, finding the separate portions of the body lying in the sand where
  they had been thrown, placed them reverently together again, and gave them
  honorable burial.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; BIRTH OF A PRINCE</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER the death of Suffolk the queen was plunged into a sea
  of anxious perplexities and troubles, which continued to disturb the kingdom
  and to agitate her mind, until at length, in 1453, eight or nine years after
  her marriage, she gave birth to a son. This event, strange as it may seem,
  aggravated the difficulties of her situation in a ten-fold degree.</p>

  <p>The reason why the birth of her child increased her troubles was this. It
  has already been said that the Duke of York claimed to be the rightful
  sovereign of England on account of being descended from an older branch of
  the royal family; but that, since Henry was established upon the throne, he
  was inclined to make no attempt to assert his claims so long as it was
  understood that he was to receive the kingdom at Henry's death. In order to
  keep him contented in this position, it had been Margaret's policy to treat
  him with great consideration, and to bestow upon him high honors, but, at the
  same time, to watch him very closely, and to avoid conferring upon him any
  such substantial power within the realm of England as would enable him to
  attempt to seize the throne. She accordingly gave him the regency of France,
  and afterward, when she recalled him from that country in order to send
  Somerset there, she sent him to Ireland.</p>

  <p>After the death of Suffolk, Somerset came home from France. Indeed, he was
  on his way home at the very time that Suffolk was killed, the English
  possessions there having been almost entirely lost. As soon as he returned,
  the queen received him into high favor at court, and soon made him the chief
  minister of the crown. The people of the country were displeased at this, and
  soon showed marks of great discontent. They would very likely have risen in
  open rebellion had it not been that Henry's health was so feeble, and the
  probability was so great that he would die without issue&mdash;in which case
  the crown would devolve peacefully to the Duke of York and his heirs.</p>

  <p>"Let us wait," said they, "for a short time, and it will all come right.
  It is better to bear the evils of this state of things a little longer than
  to plunge the country into the horrors of civil war in attempting to change
  the dynasty by force before Henry dies."</p>

  <p>In the mean time, however, although this was so far the prevailing public
  sentiment as to prevent an actual outbreak, it did not by any means save the
  community from being unnecessarily agitated by anxieties and fears lest an
  outbreak should take place, nor did it prevent innumerable plots and
  conspiracies being formed tending to produce one. The country was divided
  into two great parties&mdash;those that favored the Duke of York and his
  dynasty, and those who adhered to the house of Lancaster. The nobles took
  sides in the quarrel, some openly and others in secret. As these nobles were
  continually moving to and fro from one castle to another, or between the
  country and London, at the head of armed bodies of men more or less
  formidable, no one could tell what plans were being formed, or how soon an
  explosion might occur. The Duke of York was, of course, the head and leader
  of one side, and the Duke of Somerset, as the confidential counselor and
  minister of Henry and the queen, was the most prominent on the other side,
  and each of these great leaders regarded the other with feelings of mortal
  enmity.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Temple Garden</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>This state of things kept both the king and queen in continual anxiety.
  The queen began to find that, by her manoeuvrings and management, she had
  involved herself in difficulties that were beyond her control, and the poor
  king was so harassed by his troubles and perplexities that his health, and,
  at last, his mind, began to suffer severely.</p>

  <p>At length the Duke of York, without permission from the government,
  crossed the Channel from Ireland and landed in England. He soon collected a
  large armed force, and began to move across the country toward London. The
  government were much alarmed. He professed not to have any hostile object in
  view, and declared that he still acknowledged his allegiance to the Lancaster
  line; but there were no means of being sure that this was not a mere pretext,
  and that he might not, at any time, throw off his mask and rise in open
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that the famous symbols of the red and the white
  rose were chosen as the badges of the houses respectively of York and
  Lancaster, as has already been mentioned. The story goes that at a certain
  time, while several nobles and persons of the court were walking in what is
  called the Temple Garden, a piece of open and ornamental ground on the bank
  of the river in London, Somerset and Warwick, who were on different sides in
  this quarrel, gathered, the one a white, and the other a red rose, and
  proposed to the rest of the company to pluck roses too, each according to his
  own feelings and opinions. From this beginning the two colors became the
  permanent badge of the two lines, so much so that artificial roses of red and
  white were manufactured in great numbers at last, to supply the soldiers of
  the respective armies.</p>

  <p>But to return to the Duke of York. When it was found that he was advancing
  toward London, Somerset urged the king to put himself at the head of a body
  of troops and go out to meet him, and call him to account for his
  proceedings. The king did so, the queen accompanying the expedition. She was
  very anxious, and felt much alarmed for the safety of the king. After various
  marchings and manoeuvrings, the two armies came near each other in the county
  of Kent, to the southeastward of London. King Henry, who was eminently a man
  of peace, being possessed of no warlike qualities whatever, and being
  extremely averse to the shedding of blood, instead of attacking the Duke of
  York, sent a messenger to him to know what his intentions were in coming into
  the country at the head of such a force and what he desired.</p>

  <p>The duke replied that he had no designs against the king, but only against
  the traitor Somerset, and he said that if the king would order Somerset to be
  arrested and brought to trial, he should be satisfied, and would disband his
  forces.</p>

  <p>The king, on receiving this message, was much troubled and perplexed, but
  at length he concluded, under the advice of some of his counselors, to comply
  with this demand. He caused Somerset to be arrested, and notified the Duke of
  York that he bad done so. The Duke of York then disbanded his army, or at
  least sent the troops away; and made an appointment to come unattended and
  visit the king in his tent, with a view to conferring with him on the terms
  and conditions of a permanent reconciliation.</p>

  <p>This interview resulted in a very extraordinary scene. It seems that the
  queen had contrived the means of secretly releasing Somerset after his
  arrest, and bringing him by stealth to the king's pavilion, and concealing
  him, there behind the arras at the time the Duke of York was to be admitted,
  in order that Somerset, might be a witness of the interview. While he was
  thus secreted, the Duke of York came in. He commenced, his conference with
  the king by repeating earnestly what he said before, namely, that he had not
  been actuated in what he had done by any feeling of hostility against the
  king, but only against Somerset. His sole object in taking up arms, he said,
  was that that arch traitor might be brought to punishment.</p>

  <p>On hearing these words, Somerset could contain himself no longer, but, to
  the astonishment of the Duke of York and to the utter consternation of the
  king, he rushed out from his hiding-place, and began to assail the duke with
  the most violent reproaches, alleging that his pretensions of friendship for
  Henry were false, and that the real design of his movements was to usurp the
  throne. The duke retorted with equally fierce denunciations and threats.
  During the continuance of this altercation, the king remained stupefied and
  speechless, and at length, when the duke retired, officers were ready at the
  door to arrest him, having been stationed there by the queen.</p>

  <p>He was held a prisoner, however, but a short time, for his son, who
  afterward became Edward IV., immediately commenced raising an army to come
  and release him. It was considered, for other reasons, dangerous to attempt
  to hold such a man in durance, since probably more than half the kingdom were
  on his side. So he was offered his liberty on condition that he would take
  the new and solemn oath of fealty to the king.</p>

  <p>This he consented to do, and the oath was taken with great ceremony in St.
  Paul's Cathedral, and then he was dismissed. He went off to one of his
  castles in the country, muttering deep and earnest threats of vengeance.</p>

  <p>It was about a year after this that Margaret's babe was born. It was a
  son.</p>

  <p>Of course, the birth of this child immensely increased the difficulties
  and dangers in which the kingdom was involved, for it seemed to extinguish
  the hope that the quarrel would be settled by the York family succeeding
  peaceably to the crown on the death of Henry. Now, at length, there was an
  heir to the Lancastrian line. Of course Margaret, and all those who were
  connected with the Lancastrian line, either by blood or political
  partisanship, would resolve to support the rights of this heir. On the other
  hand, it was not to be supposed that the Duke of York would relinquish his
  claims, and he would no longer have any inducement to postpone asserting
  them. Thus the birth of the young prince was the occasion of plunging the
  country in new and more feverish excitement than ever. Plots and
  counter-plots, conspiracies and counter-conspiracies, were the order of the
  day. Every body was taking sides, or, at least, making arrangements for
  taking sides, as soon as the outbreak should occur. And no one knew how soon
  this would be.</p>

  <p>The child was born on a certain religious holiday called St. Edward's day,
  and so they named him Edward. In a few months after his birth he was made
  Prince of Wales, and it is by this title only that he is known in history,
  for he never became king.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; ILLNESS OF THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">THE circumstances of poor Margaret's case seem to have
  reversed all ordinary conditions of domestic happiness. The birth of her son
  placed her in a condition of extreme and terrible danger, while the immediate
  bursting of the storm was averted, and the sufferings which she was in the
  end called upon to endure in consequence of it were postponed for a time by
  what would, in ordinary circumstances, be the worst possible of calamities,
  the insanity of her husband. Happy as a queen, says the proverb, but what a
  mockery of happiness is this, when the birth of a child is a great domestic
  calamity, the evils of which were only in part averted, or rather postponed,
  by an unexpected blessing in the shape of the insanity of the husband and
  father.</p>

  <p>Henry's health had been gradually declining during many months before the
  little Edward was born. The cares and anxieties of his situation, which often
  became so extreme as to deprive him of all rest and sleep, became, at length,
  too heavy for him to bear, and his feeble intellect, in the end, broke down
  under them entirely. The queen did all in her power to conceal his condition
  from the people, and even from the court. It was comparatively easy to do
  this, for the derangement was not at all violent in its form. It was a sort
  of lethargy, a total failure of the mental powers and almost of
  consciousness&mdash;more like idiocy than mania. The queen removed him to
  Windsor, and there kept him closely shut up, admitting that he was sick, but
  concealing his true situation so far as was in her power, and, in the mean
  time, carrying on the government in his name, with the aid of Somerset and
  other great officers of state, whom she admitted into her confidence.
  Parliament and the public were very uneasy under this state of things. The
  Duke of York was laying his plans, and every one was anxious to know what was
  coming. But Margaret would allow nobody to enter the king's chamber, under
  any pretext whatever, except those who were in her confidence, and entirely
  under her orders.</p>

  <p>At length, about two months after Edward was born, the highest dignitary
  of the Church, the Archbishop of Canterbury, died. This event, according to
  the ancient usages of the realm, gave the House of Lords the right to send a
  deputation to the king to condole with him, and to ascertain his wishes in
  respect to the measures to be adopted on the occasion.</p>

  <p>This committee accordingly proceeded to Windsor, and coming, as they did,
  under the authority of ancient custom, which in England, in those days, had
  even more than the force of law, they could not be refused admission. They
  found the king lying helpless and unconscious, and they could not obtain from
  him any answer to what they said to him, or any sign that the slightest spark
  of intelligence remained in his mind.</p>

  <p>The committee reported these facts to the House of Lords. Finding how
  serious the king's illness was, the party of the Duke of York concluded to
  wait a little longer. There was a great probability that the king would soon
  die. The life, too, of the infant son was of course very precarious. He might
  not survive the dangers of infancy, and in that case the Duke of York would
  succeed to the throne at once without any struggle. So a sort of compromise
  was effected. Parliament appointed the Duke of York protector and defender of
  the king during his illness, or until such time as Edward, the young prince,
  should arrive at the proper age for undertaking the government. It was at
  this time that young Edward was made Prince of Wales. The conferring of this
  title upon him was confirmed by both houses of Parliament. They thus solemnly
  decreed that, though the Duke of York was to exercise the government during
  the sickness of the king and the minority of Edward, still the kingdom was to
  be reserved for Edward as the rightful heir, and he was to be put into
  possession of the sovereign power, either as regent in case his father should
  continue to live until that time, or as king if, in the interim, he should
  die.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York and his friends acceded to this arrangement, in hopes
  that the prince never would arrive at years of discretion, but that, before
  many years, and perhaps before many months, both father and son would die. He
  thought it better, at any rate, to wait quietly for a time, especially as,
  during the period of this waiting, he was put in possession substantially of
  the supreme power.</p>

  <p>Queen Margaret herself was extremely dissatisfied with the arrangement by
  which the Duke of York was made regent, since it of course deprived her of
  all her power. But she could do nothing to prevent it. Besides, her mind was
  so filled with the maternal feelings and affections which her situation
  inspired and with the care of the infant child, that she had for a time no
  heart for political contention.</p>

  <p>Then, moreover, the Parliament, at the same time that they made the Duke
  of York regent, and thus virtually deprived the queen of her power, settled
  upon her an ample annuity, by means of which she would be enabled to live,
  with her son in a state becoming her rank and her ambition. One motive,
  doubtless, which led them to do this was to induce her to acquiesce in this
  change, and remain quiet in the position in which they thus placed her.</p>

  <p>In addition to the liberal supplies which the Parliament granted to the
  queen, they made ample provision for maintaining the dignity and providing
  for the education of the young prince. Among other things, a commission of
  five physicians was appointed to watch over his health.</p>

  <p>Margaret was the more easily persuaded to acquiesce in these arrangements
  from believing, as she did, that the state of things to which they gave rise
  would be of short duration. She fully believed that her husband would
  recover, and then the regency of the Duke of York would cease, and the
  king&mdash;that is, the king in name, but she herself in reality&mdash;would
  come into power again. So she determined to bide her time.</p>

  <p>She accordingly retired from London, and set up an establishment of her
  own in her palace at Greenwich, where she held her court, and lived in a
  style of grandeur and ceremony such as would have been proper if she had been
  a reigning queen. Her old favorite, too, Somerset, was at first one of the
  principal personages of her court; but one of the first acts of the Duke of
  York's regency was to issue a warrant of arrest against him. The officers, in
  executing this warrant, seized him in the very presence-chamber of the queen.
  Margaret was extremely incensed at this deed. She declared that it was not
  only an act of political hostility, but an insult. She was, however, entirely
  helpless. The Duke of York had the power now, and she was compelled to
  submit.</p>

  <p>But she was not required to remain long in this humiliating position. She
  procured the best possible medical advice and attendance for her husband, and
  devoted herself to him with the utmost assiduity, and, at length, she had the
  satisfaction of seeing that he was beginning to amend. The improvement
  commenced in November, about eight or ten months after he first fell into the
  state of unconsciousness. When at length he came to himself, it seemed to
  him, he said, as if he was awaking from a long dream.</p>

  <p>Margaret was overjoyed to see these signs of returning intelligence. She
  longed for the time to come when she could show the king her boy. He had thus
  far never seen the child.</p>

  <p>We obtain a pretty clear idea of the state of imbecility or
  unconsciousness in which he had been lying from the account of what he did
  and said at the interview when the little prince was first brought into his
  presence. It is as follows:</p>

  <p>"On Monday, at noon, the queen came to him and brought my lord prince with
  her, and then he asked 'what the prince's name was,' and the queen told him
  'Edward,' and then he held up his hands, and thanked God thereof.</p>

  <p>"And he said he never knew him till that time, nor wist what was said to
  him, nor wist where he had been, while he had been sick, till now; and he
  asked who were the godfathers, and the queen told him, and he was well
  content.</p>

  <p>"And she told him the cardinal was dead, and he said he never knew of it
  till this time; then he said one of the wisest lords in this land was
  dead.</p>

  <p>"And my Lord of Winchester and my Lord of St. John of Jerusalem were with
  him the morrow after Twelfth day, and he did speak to them as well as ever he
  did, and when they came out they wept for joy. And he saith he is in charity
  with all the world, and so he would all the lords were. And now he saith
  matins of our Lady and even-song, and heareth his mass devoutly."</p>

  <p>The very first moment that the king was able to bear it, Margaret caused
  him to be conveyed into the House of Lords, there to resume the exercise of
  his royal powers by taking his place upon the throne and performing some act
  of sovereignty. The regency was, of course, now at an end, and the Duke of
  York, leaving London, went off into the country in high dudgeon.</p>

  <p>The queen, of course, now came into power again. The first thing that she
  did was to release Somerset from his confinement, and reinstate him as prime
  minister of the crown.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; ANXIETY AND TROUBLE</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR about six years after this time, that is, from the birth
  of Prince Edward till he was six years old, and while Margaret was advancing
  from her twenty- fourth to her thirtieth year, her life was one of continual
  anxiety, contention, and alarm. The Duke of York and his party made continual
  difficulty, and the quarrel between him, and the Earl of Warwick, and the
  other nobles who espoused his cause, on one side, and the queen, supported by
  the Duke of Somerset and other great Lancastrian partisans on the other, kept
  the kingdom in a constant ferment. Sometimes the force of the quarrel spent
  itself in intrigues, manoeuvres, and plottings, or in fierce and angry
  debates in Parliament, or in bitter animosities and contentions in private
  and social life. At other times it would break out into open war, and again
  and again was Margaret compelled to leave her child in the hands of nurses
  and guardians, while she went with her poor helpless husband to follow the
  camp, in order to meet and overcome the military assemblages which the Duke
  of York was continually bringing together at his castles in the country or in
  the open fields.</p>

  <p>The king's health during all this period was so frail, and his mind,
  especially at certain times, was so feeble, that he was almost as helpless as
  a child. There was an hereditary taint of insanity in the family, which made
  his case still more discouraging.</p>

  <p>Queen Margaret took the greatest pains to amuse him, and to provide
  employments for him that would occupy his thoughts in a gentle and soothing
  manner. When traveling about the country, she employed minstrels to sing and
  play to him; and, in order to have a constant supply of these performers
  provided, and to have them well trained to their art, she sent instructions
  to the sheriffs of the counties in all parts of the kingdom, requiring them
  to seek for all the beautiful boys that had good voices, and to have them
  instructed in the art of music, so that they might be ready, when called
  upon, to perform before the king. In the mean time they were to be paid good
  wages, and to be considered already, while receiving their instruction, as
  acting under the charge and in the service of the queen.</p>

  <p>Margaret and the other friends of the king used to contrive various other
  ways of amusing and comforting his mind, some of which were not very honest.
  One was, for example, to have different nobles and gentlemen come to him and
  ask his permission that they should leave the kingdom to go and make
  pilgrimages to various foreign shrines, in order to fulfill vows and offer
  oblations and prayers for the restoration of his majesty's health. The king
  was of a very devout frame of mind, and his thoughts were accustomed to dwell
  a great deal on religious subjects, and especially on the performance of the
  rites and ceremonies customary in those days, and it seemed to comfort him
  very much to imagine that his friends were going to make such long
  pilgrimages to pray for him.</p>

  <p>So the nobles and other great personages would ask his consent that they
  might go, and would take solemn leave of him as if they were really going,
  and then would keep out of sight a little while, until the poor patient had
  forgotten their request.</p>

  <p>It is said, however, that one nobleman, the Duke of Norfolk, who was so
  kind- hearted a man that he went by the name of the Good Duke, actually made
  the pilgrimage to Jerusalem on this errand, and there offered up prayers and
  supplications at the famous chapel of the Holy Sepulchre for the restoration
  of his sovereign's health.</p>

  <p>They used also to amuse and cheer the king's mind by telling him, from
  time to time, that he was going to be supplied with inexhaustible treasures
  of wealth by the discovery of the philosopher's stone. The philosopher's
  stone was an imaginary substance which the alchemists of those days were all
  the time attempting to discover, by means of which lead and iron, and all
  other metals, could be turned to gold. There were royal laboratories, and
  alchemists continually at work in them making experiments, and the queen used
  to give the king wonderful accounts of the progress which they were making,
  and tell him that the discovery was nearly completed, and that very soon he
  would have in his exchequer just as much money as his heart could desire. The
  poor king fully believed all these stories, and was extremely pleased and
  gratified to hear them.</p>

  <p>There were times during this interval when the king was tolerably well,
  his malady being somewhat periodical in its character. This was the case
  particularly on one occasion, soon after his first recovery from the state of
  total insensibility which has been referred to. The Duke of York, as has
  already been said, was put very much out of humor by the king's recovery on
  this occasion, and by his own consequent deposition from the office of
  regent, and still more so when he found that the first act which the queen
  performed on her recovery of power was to release his hated enemy, Somerset,
  from the prison where he, the Duke of York, had confined him, and make him
  prime minister again. He very soon determined that he would not submit to
  this indignity. He assembled an army on the frontiers of Wales, where some of
  his chief strong- holds were situated, and assumed an attitude of hostility
  so defiant that the queen's government determined to take the field to oppose
  him.</p>

  <p>So they raised an army, and the Duke of Somerset, with the queen, taking
  the king with them, set out from London and marched toward the northwest.
  They stopped first at the town of St. Alban's. When they were about to resume
  their march from St. Alban's, they saw that the hills before them were
  covered with bands of armed men, the forces of the Duke of York, which he was
  leading on toward the capital. Somerset's forces immediately returned to the
  town. Margaret, who was for a time greatly distressed and perplexed to decide
  between her duty toward her husband and toward her child, finally concluded
  to retire to Greenwich with the little prince, and await there the result of
  the battle, leaving the Duke of Somerset to do the best he could with the
  king.</p>

  <p>Very soon a herald came from the Duke of York to the gates of St. Alban's,
  and demanded a parley. He said that the duke had not taken arms against the
  king, but, only against Somerset. He professed great loyalty and affection
  for Henry himself, and only wished to save him from the dangerous counsels of
  a corrupt and traitorous minister, and he said that if the king would deliver
  up Somerset to him, he would at once disband his armies, and the difficulty
  would be all at an end.</p>

  <p>The reply sent to this was that the king declared that he would lose both
  his crown and his life before he would deliver up either the Duke of Somerset
  or even the meanest soldier in his army to such a demand.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York, on receiving this answer, immediately advanced to attack
  the town. For some time Henry's men defended the walls and gates successfully
  against him, but at length the Earl of Warwick, who was the Duke of York's
  principal confederate and supporter in this movement, passed with a strong
  detachment by another way round a hill, and through some gardens, and thence,
  by breaking down the wall which stood between the garden and the town, he
  succeeded in getting in. A terrible conflict then ensued in the streets and
  narrow lanes of the city, and the attention of the besieged being thus drawn
  off from the walls and the gates, the Duke of York soon succeeded in forcing
  his way in too.</p>

  <p>King Henry's forces were soon routed with great slaughter. The Duke of
  Somerset and several other prominent nobles were killed. The king himself was
  wounded by an arrow, which struck him in the neck as he was standing under
  his banner in the street with his officers around him. When these his
  attendants saw that the battle was going against him, they all forsook him
  and fled, leaving him by his banner alone. He remained here quietly for some
  time, and then went into a shop near by, where presently the Duke of York
  found him.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Duke came into the king's presence he kneeled before him,
  thus acknowledging him as king, and said,</p>

  <p>"The traitor and public enemy against whom we took up arms is dead, and
  now there will be no farther trouble."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the king, "for God's sake, go and stop the slaughter of my
  subjects."</p>

  <p>The duke immediately sent orders to stop the fighting, and, taking the
  king by the hand, he led him to the Abbey of St. Alban's, a venerable
  monastic edifice, greatly celebrated in the histories of these times, and
  there caused him to be conveyed to his apartment. The next day he took him to
  London. He rendered him all external tokens of homage and obedience by the
  way, but still virtually the king was his prisoner.</p>

  <p>Poor Queen Margaret was all this time at Greenwich, waiting in the utmost
  suspense and anxiety to hear tidings of the battle. When, at length, the news
  arrived that the battle had been lost, that the king had been wounded, and
  was now virtually a prisoner in the hands of her abhorred and hated enemy,
  she was thrown into a state of utter despair, so much so that she remained
  for some hours in a sort of stupor, as if all was now lost, and it was
  useless and hopeless to continue the struggle any longer.</p>

  <p>She however, at length, revived, and began to consider again what was to
  be done. The prospect before her, however, seemed to grow darker and darker.
  The fatigue and excitement which the king had suffered, joined to the effects
  of his wound, which seemed not disposed to heal, produced a relapse. The Duke
  of York appears to have considered that the time had not yet come for him to
  attempt to assert his claims to the throne. He contented himself with so
  exhibiting the condition of the king to members of Parliament as to induce
  that body to appoint him protector again. When he had thus regained
  possession of power, he restored the king to the care of the queen, and sent
  her, with him and the little prince, into the country.</p>

  <p>One of the most extraordinary circumstances which occurred in the course
  of these anxious and troubled years was a famous reconciliation which took
  place at one time between the parties to this great quarrel. It was at a time
  when England was threatened with an invasion from France. Queen Margaret
  proposed a grand meeting of all the lords and nobles on both sides, to agree
  upon some terms of pacification by which the intestine feud which divided and
  distracted the country might be healed, and the way prepared for turning
  their united strength against the foe. But it was a very dangerous thing to
  attempt to bring these turbulent leaders together. They had no confidence in
  each other, and no one of them would be willing to come to the congress
  without bringing with him a large armed force of followers and retainers, to
  defend him in case of violence or treachery. Finally, it was agreed to
  appoint the Lord-mayor of London to keep the peace among the various parties,
  and, to enable him to do this effectually, he was provided with a force of
  ten thousand men. These men were volunteers raised from among the citizens of
  London.</p>

  <p>When the time arrived for the meeting, the various leaders came in toward
  London, each at the head of a body of retainers. One man came with five
  hundred men, another with four hundred, and another with six hundred, who
  were all dressed in uniform with scarlet coats. Another nobleman,
  representing the great Percy family, came at the head of a body of fifteen
  hundred men, all his own personal retainers, and every one of them ready to
  fight any where and against any body, the moment that their feudal lord
  should give the word.</p>

  <p>These various chieftains, each at the head of his troops, came to London
  at the appointed time, and established themselves at different castles and
  strong- holds in and around the city, like so many independent sovereigns
  coming together to negotiate a treaty of peace.</p>

  <p>They spent two whole months in disputes and debates, in which the fiercest
  invectives and the most angry criminations and recriminations were uttered
  continually on both sides. At length, marvelous to relate, they came to an
  agreement All the points in dispute were arranged, a treaty was signed, and a
  grand reconciliation&mdash;that is, a pretended one&mdash;was the result.</p>

  <p>This meeting was convened about the middle of January, and on the twenty-
  fourth of March the agreement was finally made and ratified, and sealed, in a
  solemn manner, by the great seal. It contained a great variety of agreements
  and specifications, which it is not necessary to recapitulate here, but when
  all was concluded there was a grand public ceremony in commemoration of the
  event.</p>

  <p>At this celebration the king and queen, wearing their crowns and royal
  robes, walked in solemn procession to St. Paul's Cathedral in the city. They
  were followed by the leading peers and prelates walking two and two; and, in
  order to exhibit to public view the most perfect tokens and pledges of the
  fullness and sincerity of this grand reconciliation, it was arranged that
  those who had been most bitterly hostile to each other in the late quarrels
  should be paired together as they walked. Thus, immediately behind the king,
  who walked alone, came the queen and the Duke of York walking together hand
  in hand, as if they were on the most loving terms imaginable, and so with the
  rest.</p>

  <p>The citizens of London, and vast crowds of other people who had come in
  from the surrounding towns to witness the spectacle, joined in the
  celebration by forming lines along the streets as the procession passed by,
  and greeting the reconciled pairs with long and loud acclamations; and when
  night came, they brightened up the whole city with illuminations of their
  houses and bonfires in the streets.</p>

  <p>In about a year after this the parties to this grand pacification were
  fighting each other more fiercely and furiously than ever.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Little Prince and his Swans.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>At one time, when the little prince was about six years old, the queen
  made a royal progress through certain counties in the interior of the
  country, ostensibly to benefit the king's health by change of air, and by the
  gentle exercise and agreeable recreation afforded by a journey, but really,
  it is said, to interest the nobles and the people of the region through which
  she passed in her cause, and especially in that of the little prince, whom
  she took on that occasion to show to all the people on her route. She had
  adopted for him the device of his renowned ancestor, Edward III., which was a
  swan; and she had caused to be made for him a large number of small silver
  swans, which he was to present to the nobles and gentlemen, and to all who
  were admitted to a personal audience, in the towns through which he passed.
  He was a bright and beautiful boy, and he gave these little swans to the
  people who came around him with such a sweet and charming grace, that all who
  saw him were inspired with feelings of the warmest interest and affection for
  him.</p>

  <p>Very soon after this time the war between the two great contending parties
  broke out anew, and took such a course as very soon deprived King Henry of
  his crown. The events which led to this result will be related in the next
  chapter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; MARGARET A FUGITIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the summer of 1459, the year after the grand
  reconciliation took place which is described in the last chapter, two vast
  armies, belonging respectively to the two parties, which had been gradually
  gathering for a long time, came up together at a place called Blore Heath, in
  Staffordshire, in the heart of England. A great battle ensued. During the
  battle Henry lay dangerously ill in the town of Coleshill, which was not far
  off. Margaret was at Maccleston, another village very near the field of
  battle. From the tower of the church in Maccleston she watched the progress
  of the fight. Salisbury was at the head of the York party. Margaret's troops
  were commanded by Lord Audley. When Audley took leave of her to go into
  battle, she sternly ordered him to bring Salisbury to her, dead or alive.</p>

  <p>Audley had ten thousand men under his command. The soldiers were all
  adorned with red rosettes, the symbol of the house of Lancaster. The officers
  wore little silver swans upon their uniform, such as Prince Edward had
  distributed.</p>

  <p>The queen watched the progress of the battle with intense anxiety, and
  soon, to her consternation and dismay, she saw that it was going against her.
  She kept her eyes upon Audley's banner, and when, at length, she saw it fall,
  she knew that all was lost. She hurried down from the tower, and, with a few
  friends to accompany her, she fled for her life to a strong-hold belonging to
  her friends that was not at a great distance.</p>

  <p>The king, too, had to be removed, in order to prevent his being taken
  prisoner. He was, however, too feeble to know much or to think much of what
  was going on. When they came to take him on his pallet to carry him away, he
  looked up and asked, feebly, "who had got the day," but beyond this he gave
  no indication of taking any interest in the momentous events that were
  transpiring.</p>

  <p>This defeat, instead of producing a discouraging and disheartening effect
  upon Margaret's mind, only served to arouse her to new vigor and
  determination. She had been somewhat timid and fearful in the earlier part of
  her troubles, when she had only a husband to think of and to care for. But
  now she had a son; and the maternal instinct seemed to operate in her case,
  as it has done in so many others, to make her fearless, desperate, and, in
  the end, almost ferocious, in protecting her offspring from harm, and in
  maintaining his rights. She immediately engaged with the utmost zeal and
  ardor in raising a new army. She did not trust the command of it to any
  general, but directed all the operations of it herself. There is not space to
  describe in detail the campaigns that ensued, but the result was a complete
  victory. Her enemies were, in their turn, entirely defeated, and the two
  great leaders, the Duke of York and the Earl of Warwick, were actually driven
  out of the kingdom. The Duke of York retreated to Ireland, and the Earl of
  Warwick went across the Straits of Dover to Calais, which was still in
  English possession, and a great naval and military station.</p>

  <p>In a very, short time after this, however, Warwick came back again with a
  large armed force, which he had organized at Calais, and landed in the
  southern part of England. He marched toward London, carrying all before him.
  It was now his party's turn to be victorious; for by the operation of that
  strange principle which seems to regulate the ups and downs of opposing
  political parties in all countries and in all ages, victory alternates
  between them with almost the regularity of a pendulum. The current of popular
  sentiment, which had set so strongly in favor of the queen's cause only a
  short year before, appeared to be now altogether in favor of her enemies.
  Every body flocked to Warwick's standard as he marched northwardly from the
  coast toward London, and at London the people opened the gates of the city
  and received him and his troops as if they had been an army of
  deliverers.</p>

  <p>Warwick did not delay long in London. He marched to the north to meet the
  queen's troops. Another great battle was fought at Northampton. Margaret
  watched the progress of the fight from an eminence not far distant. The day
  went against her. The result of the battle was that the poor king was taken
  prisoner the second time and carried in triumph to London.</p>

  <p>The captors, however, treated him with great consideration and
  respect&mdash;not as their enemy and as their prisoner, but as their
  sovereign, rescued by them from the hands of traitors and foes. The time had
  not even yet come for the York party openly to avow their purpose of deposing
  the king. So they conveyed him to London, and lodged him in the palace there,
  where he was surrounded with all the emblems and marks of royalty, but was
  still, nevertheless, closely confined.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York then summoned a Parliament, acting in the king's name, of
  course, that is, requiring the king to sign the writs and other necessary
  documents. It was not until October that the Parliament met. During the
  interval the king was lodged in a country place not far from London, where
  every effort was made to enable him to pass his time agreeably, by giving him
  an opportunity to hunt, and to amuse and recreate himself with other out-door
  amusements. All the while, however, a strict watch was kept over him to
  prevent the possibility of his making his escape, or of the friends of the
  queen coming secretly to take him away.</p>

  <p>As for the queen and the little prince, none knew what had become of
  them.</p>

  <p>When Parliament met, a very extraordinary scene occurred in the House of
  Lords, in which the Duke of York was the principal actor, and which excited a
  great sensation. Up to this time he had put forward no actual claim to the
  throne in behalf of his branch of the family, but in all the hostilities in
  which he had been engaged against the king's troops, his object had been, as
  he had always said, not to oppose the king, but only to save him, by
  separating him from the evil influences which surrounded him. But he was now
  beginning to be somewhat more bold.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when Parliament met, he came into London at the head of a
  body- guard of five hundred horsemen, and with the sword of state borne
  before him, as if he were the greatest personage in the realm. He rode
  directly to Westminster, and, halting his men with great parade before the
  doors of the hall where the House of Lords was assembled, he went in.</p>

  <p>He advanced directly through the hall to the raised dais at the end on
  which the throne was placed. He ascended the steps, and walked to the throne,
  the whole assembly looking on in solemn awe, to see what he was going to do.
  Some expected that he was going to take his seat upon the throne, and thus at
  once assume the position that he was the true and rightful sovereign of
  England. He, however, did not do so. He stood by the throne a few minutes,
  with his hand upon the crimson cloth which covered it, as if hesitating
  whether to take his seat or not, or perhaps waiting for some intimation from
  his partisans that he was expected to do so. But for several minutes no one
  spoke a word. At length the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in some
  respects the most exalted personage in the House of Lords, asked him if he
  would be pleased to go and visit the king, who was at that time in an
  adjoining apartment. He replied in a haughty tone,</p>

  <p>"I know no one in this realm whose duty it is not rather to visit me than
  to expect me to visit him."</p>

  <p>He then turned and walked proudly out of the house.</p>

  <p>Although he thus refrained from actually seating himself upon the throne,
  it was evident that the time was rapidly drawing near when he would openly
  assert his claim to it, and some of the peers, thinking perhaps that Henry
  could be induced peaceably to yield, consulted him upon the subject, asking
  him which he thought had the best title to the crown, himself or the Duke of
  York.</p>

  <p>To this question Henry replied,</p>

  <p>"My father was king; his father was king. I have myself worn the crown for
  forty years, from my cradle. You have all sworn fealty to me as your
  sovereign, and your fathers did the same to my father and to my grandfather.
  How, then, can any one dispute my claim?"</p>

  <p>What Henry said was true. The crown had been in his branch of the royal
  line for three generations, and for more than half a century, during all
  which time the whole nation had acquiesced in their rule. The claim of the
  Duke of York ran back to a period anterior to all this, but he maintained
  that it was legitimate and valid, notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>There followed a series of deliberations and negotiations, the result of
  which was a decision on the part of Parliament that the Duke of York and his
  successors were really entitled to the crown, but that, by way of compromise,
  it was not to be in form transferred to them until after the death of Henry.
  So long as he should continue to live, he was to be nominally king, but the
  Duke of York was to govern as regent, and, at Henry's death, the crown was to
  descend to him.</p>

  <p>The duke was satisfied with this arrangement, and the first thing to be
  done, in order to secure its being well carried out, was to get the little
  prince, as well as Henry, the king, into his possession; for he well knew
  that, even if he were to dispose of the old king, and establish himself in
  possession of the throne, he could have no peace or quietness in the
  possession of it so long as the little prince, with his mother, was at
  large.</p>

  <p>So he found means to induce the king to sign a mandate commanding the
  queen to come to London and bring the prince with her. This mandate she was
  required to obey immediately, under penalty, in case of disobedience, of
  being held guilty of treason.</p>

  <p>Officers were immediately dispatched in all directions to search for the
  queen, in order to serve this mandate upon her, but she was nowhere to be
  found.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MARGARET TRIUMPHANT</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE followed after this time a series of very rapid and
  sudden reverses, by which first one party and then the other became
  alternately the victors and the vanquished, through changes of fortune of the
  most extraordinary character.</p>

  <p>At the end of the battle described in the last chapter, Margaret found
  herself, with the little prince, a helpless fugitive. There were only eight
  persons to accompany her in her flight, and so defenseless were they, and
  such was the wild and lawless condition of the country, that it was said her
  party was stopped while on their way to Wales, and the queen was robbed of
  all her jewels and other valuables. Both she and the prince would very
  probably, too, have been made prisoners and sent to London, had it not been
  that, while the marauders were busy with their plunder, she contrived to make
  her escape.</p>

  <p>She remained a very short time in Wales, and then proceeded by sea to
  Scotland, where her party, and she herself personally, had powerful friends.
  By the aid of these friends, and through the influence of the indomitable
  spirit and resolution which she displayed, she was soon supplied with a new
  force. At the head of this force she crossed the frontier into England. The
  people seemed every where to pity her misfortunes, and they were so struck
  with the energy and courage she displayed in struggling against them, and in
  braving the dreadful dangers which surrounded her in defense of the rights of
  her husband and child, that they flocked to her standard from all quarters,
  and thus in eight days from the time that the mandate was issued from London
  commanding her to surrender herself a prisoner, she appeared in the vicinity
  of the city of York, the largest and strongest city in all the north of
  England, at the head of an overwhelming force.</p>

  <p>The Duke of York was astounded when this intelligence reached him in
  London. There was not a moment to be lost. He immediately set out with all
  the troops which he could command, and marched to the northward to meet the
  queen. At the same time, he sent orders to the other leaders of his party, in
  different parts of England, to move to the northward as rapidly as possible,
  and join him there.</p>

  <p>The duke himself arrived first in the vicinity of the queen's army, but he
  thought he was not strong enough to attack her, and he accordingly concluded
  to wait until his re-enforcements should come up. The queen advanced with a
  much superior force to meet him. The two armies came together near the town
  of Wakefield, and here, after some delay, during which the queen continually
  challenged the duke to come out from his walls and fortifications to meet
  her, and defied and derided him with many taunts and reproaches, a great
  battle was finally fought.</p>

  <p>Margaret's troops were victorious. Two thousand out of five thousand of
  the duke's troops were left dead upon the field, and the duke himself was
  slain!</p>

  <p>Margaret's heart was filled with the wildest exultation and joy when she
  heard that her inveterate and hated foe at last was dead. She could scarcely
  restrain her excitement. One of the nobles of her party, Lord Clifford, whose
  father had been killed in a previous battle under circumstances of great
  atrocity, cut off the duke's head from his body, and carried it to Margaret
  on the end of a pike. She was for a moment horror-stricken at the ghastly
  spectacle, and turned her face away; but she finally ordered the head to be
  set up upon a pole on the walls of York, in view of all beholders.</p>

  <p>A young son of the duke's, the Earl of Rutland, who was then about twelve
  years old, was also killed, or rather massacred, on the field of battle,
  after the fight was over, as he was endeavoring to make his escape, under the
  care of his tutor, to a castle near, where he would have been safe. This was
  the castle of Sandal. It was a very strong place, and was in the possession
  of the Duke of York's party. The poor boy was cut down mercilessly by the
  same Lord Clifford who has already been spoken of, notwithstanding all that
  his tutor could do to save him.</p>

  <p>Other most atrocious murders were committed at the close of this battle.
  The Earl of Salisbury was beheaded, and his head was set up upon a pike on
  the walls of York, by the side of the duke's. Margaret was almost beside
  herself at the results of this victory. Her armies triumphant, the great
  leader of the party of her enemies, the man who had been for years her dread
  and torment, slain, and all his chief confederates either killed or taken
  prisoners, and nothing now apparently in the way to prevent her marching in
  triumph to London, liberating her husband from his thraldom, and taking
  complete and undisputed possession of the supreme power, there seemed, so far
  as the prospect now before her was concerned, to be nothing more to
  desire.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; MARGARET AN EXILE</h2>

  <p class="first">BRIGHT as were the hopes and prospects of Margaret after the
  battle of Wakefield, a few short months were sufficient to involve her cause
  again in the deepest darkness and gloom. The battle of Wakefield, and the
  death of the Duke of York, took place near the last of December, in 1460. In
  March, three months later, Margaret was an exile from England, outlawed by
  the supreme power of the realm, and placed under such a ban that it was
  forbidden to all the people of England to have any communication with
  her.</p>

  <p>This fatal result was brought about, in a great measure, by the reaction
  in the minds of the people of the country, which resulted from the shocking
  cruelties perpetrated by her and by her party after the battle of Wakefield.
  The accounts of these transactions spread through the kingdom, and awakened a
  universal feeling of disgust and abhorrence. It was said that when Lord
  Clifford carried the head of the Duke of York to Margaret on the point of a
  lance, followed by a crowd of other knights and nobles, he said to her,</p>

  <p>"Look, madam! The war is over! Here is the ransom for the king!"</p>

  <p>Then all the by-standers raised a shout of exultation, and began pointing
  at the ghastly head, with mockings and derisive laughter. They had put a
  paper crown upon the head, which they seemed to think produced a comic
  effect. The queen, though at first she averted her face, soon turned back
  again toward the horrid trophy, and laughed, with the rest, at the ridiculous
  effect produced by the paper crown.</p>

  <p>The murder, too, of the innocent child, the duke's younger son, produced a
  great and very powerful sensation throughout the land. The queen, though she
  had not, perhaps, commanded this deed, still made herself an accessory by
  commending it and exulting over it, The ferocious hate with which she was
  animated against all the family of her fallen foe was also shown by another
  circumstance, and that was, that when she commanded the two heads, viz., that
  of the Duke of York and that of the Earl of Salisbury, to be set upon the
  city walls, she ordered that a space should be left between them for two
  other heads, one of which was to be that of Edward, the oldest son of the
  Duke of York, who was still alive, not having been present at the battle of
  Wakefield, and who, of course, now inherited the title and the claims of his
  father.</p>

  <p>This young Edward was at this time about nineteen years of age. His title
  had been hitherto the Earl of March, and he would, of course, now become the
  Duke of York, only he chose to assume that of King of England. He was a young
  man of great energy of character, and he was sustained, of course, by all his
  father's party, who now transferred their allegiance to him. Indeed, their
  zeal in his service was redoubled by the terrible resentment and the thirst
  for vengeance which the cruelties of the queen awakened in their minds.
  Edward immediately put himself in motion with all the troops that he could
  command. He was in the western part of England at the tine of his father's
  death, and he immediately began to move toward the coast in order to
  intercept Margaret on her march toward London.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Earl of Warwick advanced from London itself to the
  northward to meet the queen, taking with him the king, who had up to this
  time remained in London. The armies of Warwick and of the queen came into the
  vicinity of each other not far from St. Alban's, before the young Duke of
  York came up, and a desperate battle was fought. Warwick's army was composed
  chiefly of men hastily got together in London, and they were no match for the
  experienced and sturdy soldiers which Margaret had brought with her from the
  Scottish frontier. They were entirely defeated. They fought all day, but at
  night they dispersed in all directions, and in the hurry and confusion of
  their flight they left the poor king behind them.</p>

  <p>During the battle Margaret did not know that her husband was on the
  ground. But at night, as soon as Henry's keepers had abandoned him, a
  faithful serving- man who remained with him ran into Margaret's camp, and
  finding one of the nobles in command there, he informed him of the situation
  of the king. The noble immediately informed the queen, and she, overjoyed at
  the news, flew to the place where her husband lay, and, on finding him, they
  embraced each other with the most passionate tokens of affection and joy.</p>

  <p>Margaret brought the little prince to be presented to him, and then they
  all together proceeded to the abbey at St. Alban's, where apartments were
  provided for them. They first, however, went to the church, in order to
  return thanks publicly for the deliverance of the king.</p>

  <p>They were received at the door of the church by the abbot and the monks,
  who welcomed them with hymns of praise and thanksgiving as they approached.
  After the ceremonies had been performed, they went to the apartments in the
  abbey which had been provided for them, intending to devote some days to
  quiet and repose.</p>

  <p>In the mean time the excitement throughout the country continued and
  increased. The queen perpetrated fresh cruelties, ordering the execution of
  all the principal leaders from the other side that fell into her hands. She
  alienated the minds of the people from her cause by not restraining her
  troops from plundering; and, in order to obtain money to defray the expenses
  of her army and to provide them with food, she made requisitions upon the
  towns through which she passed, and otherwise harassed the people of the
  country by fines and confiscations.</p>

  <p>The people were at length so exasperated by these high-handed proceedings,
  and by the furious and vindictive spirit which Margaret manifested in all
  that she did; that the current turned altogether in favor of the young Duke
  of York. The scattered forces of his party were reassembled. They began soon
  to assume so formidable an appearance that Margaret found it would be best
  for her to retire toward the north again. She of course took with her the
  king and the Prince of Wales.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Edward, the young Duke of York, advanced toward London.
  The whole city was excited to the highest pitch of enthusiasm at his
  approach. A large meeting of citizens declared that Henry should reign no
  longer, but that they would have Edward for king.</p>

  <p>When Edward arrived in London he was received by the whole population as
  their deliverer. A grand council of the nobles and prelates was convened,
  and, after solemn deliberations, Henry was deposed and Edward was declared
  king.</p>

  <p>Two days after this a great procession was formed, at the head of which
  Edward rode royally to Westminster and took his seat upon the throne.</p>

  <p>Margaret made one more desperate effort to retrieve the fortunes of her
  family by a battle fought at a place called Towton. This battle was fought in
  a snow- storm. It was an awful day. Margaret's party were entirely defeated,
  and nearly thirty thousand of them were left dead upon the field.</p>

  <p>As soon as the result was known, Margaret, taking with her her husband and
  child and a small retinue of attendants, fled to the northward. She stopped a
  short time at the Castle of Alnwick, a strong-hold belonging to one of her
  friends; but, finding that the forces opposed to her were gathering strength
  every day and advancing toward her, and that the country generally was
  becoming more and more disposed to yield allegiance to the new king, she
  concluded that it would not be safe for her to remain in England any
  longer.</p>

  <p>So, taking her husband and the little prince with her, and also a few
  personal, attendants, she left Alnwick and crossed the frontier into
  Scotland, a fugitive and an exile, and with no hope apparently of ever being
  able to enter England again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A ROYAL COUSIN</h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as Margaret escaped to Scotland, far from being
  disheartened by her misfortunes, she began at once to concert measures for
  raising a new army and going into England again, with a view of making one
  more effort to recover her husband's throne. She knew, of course, that there
  was a large body of nobles, and of the people of the country, who were still
  faithful to her husband's cause, and who would be ready to rally round his
  standard whenever and wherever it should appear. All that she required was
  the nucleus of an army at the outset, and a tolerably successful beginning in
  entering the country. There were knights and nobles, and great numbers of
  men, every where ready to join her as soon as she should appear, but they
  were nowhere strong enough to commence a movement on their own
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>One of the measures which she adopted for strengthening her interest with
  the royal family of Scotland was to negotiate a marriage between the young
  prince, who was now seven years old, and a Scotch princess. She succeeded in
  conditionally arranging this marriage, but she found that she could not raise
  troops for a second invasion of England.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, she had sent three noblemen as her messengers into
  France, to see what could be done in that country. France was her native
  land, and the king at that time, Charles VII., was her uncle. She had strong
  reason to hope, therefore, that she might find aid and sympathy there. Toward
  the close of the summer, however, she received a letter from two of her
  messengers at Dieppe which was not at all encouraging.</p>

  <p>The letter began by saying, on the part of the messengers, that they had
  already written to Margaret three times before; once by the return of the
  vessel, called the Carvel, in which they went to France, and twice from
  Dieppe, where they then were, but all the letters were substantially to
  communicate the same evil tidings, namely, that the king, her uncle, was
  dead, and that her cousin had succeeded to the throne, but that the new king
  seemed not at all disposed to regard her cause favorably. His officers at
  Dieppe had caused all their papers to be seized and taken to the king, and he
  had shut up one of their number in the castle of Arques, which is situated at
  a short distance from Dieppe. He had been apparently prevented, from
  imprisoning the other two by their having been provided with a safe-conduct,
  which protected them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the writers of the letter bade the queen keep up good
  courage, and advised her, for the present, to remain quietly where she was.
  She must not, they said, venture herself, or the little prince, upon the sea
  in an attempt to come to France unless she found herself exposed to great
  danger in remaining in Scotland. They wished her to notify the king, too, who
  they supposed was at that time secreted in Wales, for they had heard that the
  Earl of March&mdash;they would not call him King of England, but still
  designated him by his old name&mdash;was going into Wales with an army to
  look for him.</p>

  <p>They said, in conclusion, that as soon as they were set at liberty they
  should immediately come to the queen in Scotland. Nothing but death would
  prevent their rejoining her, and they devoutly hoped and believed that they
  should not be called to meet with death until they could have the
  satisfaction of seeing her husband the king and herself once more in
  peaceable possession of their realm.</p>

  <p>But the reader may perhaps like to peruse the letter itself in the words
  in which it was written. It is a very good specimen of the form in which the
  English language was written in those days, though it seems very quaint and
  old-fashioned now. It was as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">"MADAM,&mdash;Please your good God, we have, since our
  coming hither, written to your highness thrice; once by the carvel in which
  we came, the other two from Dieppe. But, madam, it was all one thing in
  substance, putting you in knowledge of your uncle's death, whom God assoil,
  and how we stood arrested, and do yet. But on Tuesday next we shall up to the
  king, your cousin-german. His commissaires, at the first of our tarrying,
  took all our letters and writings, and bore them up to the king, leaving my
  Lord of Somerset in keeping at the castle of Arques, and my fellow
  Whyttingham and me (for we had safe-conduct) in the town of Dieppe, where we
  are yet.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Madam, fear not, but be of good comfort, and beware ye
  venture not your person, nor my lord the prince, by sea, till ye have other
  word from us, unless your person can not be sure where ye are, and extreme
  necessity drive ye thence.</p>

  <p class="letter">"And, for God's sake, let the king's highness be advised of
  the same; for, as we are informed, the Earl of March is into Wales by land,
  and hath sent his navy thither by sea.</p>

  <p class="letter">"And, madam, think verily, as soon as we be delivered, we
  shall come straight to you, unless death take us by the way, which we trust
  he will not till we see the king and you peaceably again in your realm; the
  which we beseech God soon to see, and to send you that your highness
  desireth. Written at Dieppe the 30th day of August, 1461.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your true subjects and liegemen, "HUNGERFORD AND
  WHYTTINGHAM."</p><br>

  <p>Margaret remained through the winter in Scotland, anxiously endeavoring to
  devise means to rebuild her fallen fortunes. But all was in vain; no light or
  hope appeared. At length, when the spring opened, she determined to go
  herself to France and see the king her cousin, in hopes that, by her presence
  at the court, and her personal influence over the king, something might be
  done.</p>

  <p>The king her cousin had been her playmate in their childhood. He was the
  son of Mary, her father Ren's sister. Mary and Ren had been very strongly
  attached to each other, and the children had been brought up much together.
  Margaret now hoped that, on seeing her again in her present forlorn and
  helpless condition, his former friendship for her would revive, and that he
  would do something to aid her.</p>

  <p>She was, however, entirely destitute of money, and she would have found it
  very difficult to contrive the means of getting to France, had it not been
  for the kindness of a French merchant who resided in Scotland, and whom she
  had known in former years in Nancy, in Lorraine, where she had rendered him
  some service. The merchant had since acquired a large fortune in commercial
  operations between Scotland and Flanders which he conducted. In his
  prosperity he did not forget the kindness he had received from the queen in
  former years, and, now that she was in want and in distress, he came forward
  promptly to relieve her. He furnished her with the funds necessary for her
  voyage, and provided a vessel to convey her and her attendants to the coast
  of France. She sailed from the port of Kirkcudbright, on the western coast of
  Scotland, and so passed down through the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel,
  thus avoiding altogether the Straits of Dover, where she would have incurred
  danger of being intercepted by the English men-of-war.</p>

  <p>She took the young prince with her. The king it was thought best to leave
  behind.</p>

  <p>So great were the number of persons dependent upon the queen, and so
  urgent were their necessities; that all the funds which the French merchant
  had furnished her were exhausted on her arrival in France. She found,
  moreover, that the three friends, the noblemen whom she had sent to France
  the summer before, and from whom she had received the letter we have quoted,
  had left that country and gone to Scotland to seek her. They had provided
  themselves with a vessel, in which they intended to take the queen away from
  Scotland and convey her to some place of safety, not knowing that she had
  herself embarked for France. They must have passed the queen's vessel on the
  way, unless, indeed, which is very probably the case, they went up the
  Channel and through the Straits of Dover, thus taking an altogether different
  route from that chosen by the queen.</p>

  <p>When they reached Scotland they hovered on the coast a long time,
  endeavoring to find an opportunity to communicate with her secretly; but at
  length they learned that she was gone.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, Margaret, having arrived in France, borrowed some money
  of the Duke of Brittany, in whose dominions it would seem she first landed.
  With this money Margaret supplied the most pressing wants of her party, and
  also made arrangements for pursuing her journey into the country, to the town
  in Normandy where her cousin the king was then residing.</p>

    <p class="caption">Louis XI., Margaret's Cousin</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It is said that, on arriving at the court of the king and obtaining
  admission to his majesty's presence, Margaret took the young prince by the
  hand, and, throwing herself down at her cousin's feet, she implored him, with
  many tears, to take pity upon her forlorn and wretched condition, and that of
  her unhappy husband, and to aid her in her efforts to recover his throne.</p>

  <p>But the king, with true royal heartlessness, was unmoved by her distress,
  and manifested no disposition to espouse her cause.</p>

  <p>Some negotiations, however, ensued, at the close of which the king
  promised to loan her a sum of money&mdash;for a consideration. The
  consideration was that she was to convey to him the port and town of Calais,
  which was still held by the English, and was considered a very important and
  very valuable possession, or else pay back double the money which she
  borrowed.</p>

  <p>Thus it was not an absolute sale of Calais, but only a mortgage of it,
  which the queen executed. But, nevertheless, as soon as this transaction was
  made known in England, it excited great indignation throughout the country,
  and seriously injured the cause of the queen. The people accused her of being
  ready to alienate the possessions of the crown, possessions which it had cost
  so much both in blood and treasure to procure.</p>

  <p>Of course, the security which the king obtained for his loan was of a
  somewhat doubtful character, for Margaret's mortgage deed of Calais, although
  she gave it in King Henry's name, and was careful to state in it that she was
  expressly authorized by him to make it, was of no force at all so long as
  Edward of York reigned in England, and was acknowledged by the people as the
  rightful king. It was only in the event of Margaret's succeeding in
  recovering the throne for her husband that the mortgage could take effect.
  The deed which she executed stipulated that, as soon as King Henry should be
  restored to his kingdom, he would appoint one of two persons named, in whom
  the King of France had confidence, as governor of the town, with authority to
  deliver it up to the King of France in one year in case she did not within
  that time pay back double the sum of money borrowed.</p>

  <p>He seemed to think that, considering the great risk he was taking, a
  hundred percent per annum was not an exorbitant usury.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; RETURN TO ENGLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">MARGARET found one friend in France, who seems to have
  espoused her cause from a sentiment of sincere and disinterested attachment
  to her. This was a certain knight named Pierre de Brez. He was an officer of
  high rank in the government of Normandy, and a man of very considerable
  influence among the distinguished personages of those times.</p>

  <p><a id="pic18"

    <p class="caption">Map of the Scottish Border</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Margaret had known him intimately many years before. He was appointed one
  of the commissioners on the French side to negotiate, with Suffolk and the
  others, the terms of Margaret's marriage, and he had taken a very prominent
  part in the tournaments and other celebrations which took place in honor of
  the wedding before Margaret left her native land. When he now saw the poor
  queen coming back to France an exile, bereft of friends, of resources, and
  almost of hope, the interest which he had felt for her in former years was
  revived. It is said that he fell in love with her. However this may be, it is
  certain that Margaret's great beauty must have had a very important influence
  in deepening the sentiment of compassion which the misfortunes of the poor
  fugitive were so well calculated to inspire. At any rate, Brez entered at
  once into the queen's service with great enthusiasm. He brought with him a
  force of two thousand men. With this army, and with the money which she had
  borrowed of King Louis, Margaret resolved to make one more attempt to recover
  her husband's kingdom.</p>

  <p>At length, in the month of October, 1462, five months after she arrived in
  France, she set sail with a small number of vessels, containing the soldiers
  that Brez had provided for her. Her plan was to land in the north of
  England, for it was in that part of the country that the friends of the
  Lancaster line were most numerous and powerful.</p>

  <p>King Edward's government knew something of her plans, or, at least,
  suspected them, and they stationed a fleet to watch for her and intercept
  her. She, however, contrived to elude them, and reached the shores of England
  in safety.</p>

  <p>The fleet approached the shore at Tynemouth, but the guns of the forts
  were pointed against her, and she was forbidden to land. She, however,
  succeeded, either at that place or at some other point along the coast, in
  effecting a debarkation; but she was threatened so soon with an attack by a
  large army which she heard was approaching, under the command of the Earl of
  Warwick, that the French troops fled precipitately to their ships, leaving
  Margaret, the prince, Brez, and a few others who remained faithful to her,
  on shore. Being thus deserted, Margaret and her party were compelled to
  retreat too. They embarked on board a fisherman's boat, which was the only
  means of conveyance left to them, and in this manner made their way to
  Berwick, which town was in the possession of her friends.</p>

  <p>They were long in reaching Berwick, being detained by a storm. The storm,
  however, caused Margaret a much greater injury than mere detention. The ships
  in which the French soldiers had fled were caught by it off a range of rocky
  cliffs lying between Tynemouth and Berwick, the most prominent of which is
  called Bamborough Head. The ships were driven upon the rocks and rocky
  islands which lay along the shore, and there broken to pieces by the sea
  which rolled in upon them from the offing. All the stores, and provisions,
  and munitions of war which Margaret had brought from France, and which
  constituted almost her sole reliance for carrying on the war, were lost. Most
  of the men saved themselves, and made their escape to an island that lay
  near, called Holy Island. But here they were soon afterward attacked by a
  body of Yorkist troops and cut to pieces.</p>

  <p>Margaret reached Berwick in her fishing-boat at last, bearing these
  terrible tidings to her friends there. One would suppose that the last hope
  of her being able to retrieve her fallen fortunes would now be extinguished,
  and that she would sink down in utter and absolute despair.</p>

  <p>But it was not in Margaret's nature to despair. The more heavily the
  pressure of calamity and the hostility of her foes weighed upon her, the more
  fierce and determined was the spirit of resistance which they aroused in her
  bosom. In this instance, instead of yielding to dejection and despondency,
  she began at once to take measures for assembling a new force, and the ardor
  and energy which she displayed inspired all around her with some portion of
  her confidence and zeal. A new army was raised during the winter. Very early
  in the spring it took the field, and a series of military operations
  followed, in which towns and castles were taken and retaken, and skirmishes
  fought all along the Scottish frontier. At length the contending forces were
  concentrated near a place called Hexham, and a general battle ensued. The
  queen's army was defeated. The king, who was in the battle, had a most narrow
  escape. He fled on horseback&mdash;for when he was in good bodily health he
  was an excellent horseman&mdash;but he was so hotly pursued that three of his
  body- guard were taken.</p>

  <p>It is mentioned that one of the men thus taken wore the king's cap of
  state, which was embroidered with two crowns of gold, one representing the
  kingdom of England and the other that of France, the title to which country
  the English sovereigns still pretended to claim, in virtue of their former
  extended possessions there, although pretty much all except the town of
  Calais was now lost.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the pursuers of the king's party were deceived by this royal cap;
  and took the wearer of it for the king. At any rate, the officer wearing the
  cap was taken, and the king escaped.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the victory on the field at Hexham, a body of the
  Yorkist troops broke into the camp where the queen was quartered, and where,
  with the young prince, she was awaiting the result of the battle. As soon as
  the queen found that the enemy were coming, she seized the prince and ran off
  with him, in mortal terror, into a neighboring wood. She knew well that, if
  the child was taken, he would certainly be killed. Indeed, such bloody work
  had been made on both sides, with assassinations and executions during the
  year prior to this time, that men's minds were in the highest state of
  exasperation; and it is probable that both Margaret herself and the child
  would have been butchered on the spot if they had remained in the camp until
  the victorious troops entered it.</p>

  <p>As soon as Margaret gained the wood she turned off into the most obscure
  and solitary paths that she could find, thinking of nothing but to escape
  from her pursuers, who, she imagined in her fright, were close behind. At
  length, after wandering about in this manner for some time, she fell in with
  a company of men in the wood, who were either a regular band of robbers, or
  were tempted to become robbers on that occasion by the richness of the
  stranger's dress, and by the articles of jewelry and other decorations which
  she wore; for, although Margaret's means were extremely limited, she still
  maintained, in some degree, the bearing and the appointments of a queen.</p>

  <p>The men at once stopped her, and began to plunder her and the prince of
  every thing which they could take from them that appeared to be of value. As
  soon as they had possessed themselves of this plunder they began to quarrel
  about it among themselves. Margaret remained standing near, in great anxiety
  and distress, until presently, watching her opportunity, she caught up the
  prince in her arms and slipped away into the adjoining thickets.</p>

  <p>She ran forward as fast as she could go until she supposed herself out of
  the reach of pursuit from the robbers, and then looked for a place in the
  densest part of the wood where she could hide, with the intention of
  remaining there until night. Her plan was then to find her way out of the
  wood, and so wander on until she should come to the residence of some one of
  her friends, who she might hope would harbor and conceal her.</p>

  <p>She accordingly continued in her hiding-place until evening came on, and
  then, having recovered in some degree, by this interval of rest, from the
  excitement, fatigue, and terror which she had endured, she came out into a
  path again, leading little Edward by the hand. The moon was shining, and this
  enabled her to see where to go.</p>

  <p>After wandering on for some time, she was alarmed by the apparition of a
  tall man, armed, who suddenly appeared in the pathway at a short distance
  before her. She had no doubt that this was another robber. It was too late
  for her to attempt to fly from him. He was too near to allow her any chance
  of escape. In this extremity, she conceived the idea of throwing herself upon
  his generosity as her last and only hope. So she advanced boldly toward him,
  leading the little prince by the hand, and said to him, presenting the
  prince,</p>

  <p>"My friend, this is the son of your king! Save him!"</p>

  <p>The man appeared astonished. In a moment he laid his sword down at
  Margaret's feet in token of submission to her, and then immediately offered
  to conduct her and the prince to a place of safety. He also explained to her
  that he was one of her friends. He had been ruined by the war, and driven
  from his home, and was now, like the queen herself, a wanderer and a
  fugitive. He had taken possession of a cave in the wood, and there he was now
  living with his wife as an outlaw. He led Margaret and the prince to the
  cave, where they were received by his wife, and entertained with such
  hospitalities as a home so gloomy and comfortless could afford.</p>

    <p class="caption">Margaret at the Cave</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Margaret remained an inmate of this cave for two days. The place is known
  to this day as Margaret's Cave. It stands in a very secluded spot on the
  banks of a small stream. The ground around it is now open, but in Margaret's
  time it was in the midst of the forest. The entrance to the cave is very low.
  Within, it is high enough for a man to stand upright. It is about thirty-four
  feet long, and half as wide. There are some appearances of its having been
  once divided by a wall into two separate apartments.</p>

  <p>For two days Margaret remained in the cave, suffering, of course, the
  extreme of suspense and anxiety all the time, being in great solicitude to
  hear from her friends, the nobles and generals who had been defeated with her
  in the battle. Her host made diligent though secret inquiries, but could gain
  no tidings. At length, on the morning of the third day, to Margaret's
  infinite relief and joy, he came in bringing with him De Brez himself, with
  his squire, whose name was Barville, and an English gentleman who had escaped
  with De Brez from the battle, and had since been wandering about with him,
  looking every where for the queen. Margaret was for the moment overjoyed to
  see these friends again, but her exultation was soon succeeded by the deepest
  grief at hearing the terrible accounts they gave of the death of her nearest
  friends, some of whom had been killed in the battle, and others had been
  taken prisoners and cruelly executed immediately afterward. Up to this time,
  through all the danger and suffering which she had endured since the battle,
  she had been either in a state of stupor, or else filled with resentment and
  rage against her enemies, and she had not shed a tear; but now grief for the
  loss of these dear and faithful friends seemed to take the place of all other
  emotions, and she wept a long time as if her heart would break.</p>

  <p>Margaret learned, however, from her friends that the king had made his
  escape, and was probably in a place of safety, and this gave her great
  consolation. It was thought that the king had succeeded in making his way to
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the course of the day, one of the party who came with Brez went out
  into the neighboring villages to see if he could learn any new tidings, and
  before long he returned bringing with him several nobles of high rank and
  princes of the Lancastrian line. Margaret felt much relieved to find her
  party so strengthened, and arrangements were soon made by the whole party for
  Margaret to leave the cave with them, and endeavor to reach the Scottish
  frontier, which was not much more, in a direct line, than thirty miles from
  where they were.</p>

  <p>Before they departed from the cave Margaret expressed her thanks very
  earnestly to the outlaw and his wife for their kindness in receiving her and
  the little prince into their cave, and in doing so much for their comfort
  while there, although by so doing they not only encroached very much upon
  their own slender means of support, but also incurred a very serious risk in
  harboring such a fugitive. Having been plundered of every thing by the
  robbers in the wood, she had nothing but thanks to return to her kind
  protectors. The nobles who were now with her offered the wife of the outlaw
  some money&mdash;for they had still a small supply of money left&mdash;but
  she would not receive it. They would require all they had, she said, for
  themselves, before they reached Scotland.</p>

  <p>The queen was much moved by this generosity, and she said that of all that
  she had lost there was nothing that she regretted so much as the power of
  rewarding such goodness.</p>

  <p>On leaving the wood at Hexham, the party, instead of proceeding north,
  directly toward the frontier of Scotland, concluded to journey westward to
  Carlisle, intending to take passage by water from that place through Solway
  to Kirkcudbright, the port from which Margaret had sailed when she went to
  France. They were obliged to use a great many precautions in traversing the
  country to prevent being discovered. The party consisted of Margaret and the
  young prince, attended by Brez and his squire, and also by the man of the
  cave, who was acquainted with the country, and acted as guide. They reached
  Carlisle in safety, and there embarked on board a vessel, which took them
  down the Firth and landed them in Kirkcudbright.</p>

  <p>Though now out of England, Margaret did not feel much more at ease than
  before, for during her absence in France a treaty had been made between King
  Edward and the Scottish king which would prevent the latter from openly
  harboring her in his dominions; so she was obliged to keep closely
  concealed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; YEARS OF EXILE</h2>

  <p class="first">MARGARET had not been long in Kirkcudbright before she was
  accidentally seen by a man who knew her. This man was an Englishman. His name
  was Cork. He was of the Yorkist party. He said nothing when he saw the queen,
  but he immediately formed the resolution to seize her and all her party, and
  to convey them to England and give them up to King Edward. He contrived some
  way to carry this plot into execution. He seized de Brez and his squire, and
  also the queen and the prince, and carried them on board a boat in the night,
  having first bound and gagged them, to disable them from making resistance or
  uttering any cries. It seems that De Brez was not with the queen when he was
  taken, and as it was dark when they were put on board the boat, and neither
  could speak, neither party knew that the others were there until the morning,
  when they were far away from the shore, out in the wide part of the Solway
  Bay.</p>

  <p>In the night, however, De Brez, who was a man of address and of great
  personal strength, as well as of undaunted bravery, contrived to get free
  from his bonds, and also to free his squire, without letting the boatmen know
  what he had done. Then, in the morning, watching for a good opportunity, they
  together rose upon the boatmen, seized the oars, and, after a violent
  struggle, in which they came very near upsetting the boat, they finally
  succeeded in killing some of the men, and in throwing the others overboard.
  They immediately liberated Margaret and the prince, and then attempted to
  make for the shore.</p>

  <p>After having been tossed about for sometime in the Gulf or Firth of
  Solway, the boat was carried by the wind away up through the North Channel
  more than sixty miles, and finally was thrown upon a sand-bank near the coast
  of Cantyre, a famous promontory extending into the sea in this part of
  Scotland. The boat struck at some distance from the dry land, and the sea
  rolled in so heavily upon it that there was danger of its being broken to
  pieces; so De Brez took the queen upon his shoulders, and, wading through
  the water, conveyed her to the shore. Barville, the squire, carried the
  prince in the same way. And so they were once more safe on land.</p>

  <p>They found the coast wild and barren, and the country desolate; but this
  was attended with one advantage at least, and that was that the queen was in
  little danger of being recognized; for, as one of Margaret's historians
  expresses it, the peasants were so ignorant that they could not conceive of
  any one's being a queen unless she had a crown upon her head and a sceptre in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>They all went up a little way into the country, and at length found a
  small hamlet, where Margaret concluded to remain with the prince until De
  Brez could go to Edinburgh and learn what the condition of the country was,
  and so enable her to consider what course to pursue.</p>

  <p>The report which De Brez brought back on his return was very
  discouraging. Margaret, however, on hearing it, determined to go to Edinburgh
  herself, to see what she could do. She found, on her arrival there, that the
  government were not willing to do any thing more for her. They would furnish
  her with the means, they said, if she wished, of going back to England in a
  quiet way, with a view of seeking refuge among some of her friends there, but
  that was all that they could do.</p>

  <p>So Margaret went back to England, and remained for some little time in the
  great castle of Bamborough, which was still in the hands of her friends. She
  tried here to contrive some way of reassembling her scattered adherents and
  making a new rally, but she found that that objest could not be accomplished.
  Thus all the resources which could be furnished by France, Scotland, or
  England for her failing cause seemed to be exhausted, and, after turning her
  eyes in every direction for help, she concluded to cross the German Ocean
  into Flanders, to see if she could find any sympathy or succor there.</p>

  <p>Compared with the number of attendants that were with her in her flight
  into Scotland, the retinue of friends and followers by which she was
  accompanied in this retreat to the Continent was quite large, though it is
  probable that most of this company went with her quite as much on their own
  account as on the queen's. The whole party numbered about two hundred. They
  embarked from Bamborough on board two ships, but very soon after they had
  left the land a storm arose, and the two ships were separated from each
  other, and for twelve hours, the one which Margaret and the prince had taken
  was in imminent danger of being overwhelmed. The wind rose to a perfect
  hurricane, and no one expected that they could possibly escape.</p>

  <p>At length, however, the gale subsided so as to allow the ship to make a
  port; not the port of their destination, however, but one far to the
  southward of it, in a territory belonging to Philip, Duke of Burgundy,
  between whom and Margaret there had been, during all Margaret's life, a
  hereditary and implacable enmity. Margaret was greatly alarmed at finding
  herself thus at the mercy of a person whom she considered as one of her
  deadliest foes.</p>

  <p>But, very much to her surprise, the duke, as soon as he heard of her
  arrival in the country, took pity on her misfortunes, forgot all his former
  enmity, and treated her in the most generous manner. He was not at Lille, his
  capital, when she arrived, but he sent his son to receive her, and to conduct
  her to the capital, with every possible mark of respect. When she went on
  afterward to meet the duke, he sent a guard of honor to escort her, and when
  she arrived at his court, which was at that time at a place called St. Pol,
  he received her in a very distinguished manner, and prepared great
  entertainments and festivities to do her honor.</p>

  <p>He rendered her, also, still more substantial services than these, by
  furnishing her with an ample supply of funds for all her immediate wants. He
  gave to each of the ladies in her train a hundred crowns, to Brez a
  thousand, and to Margaret herself an order on his treasurer for ten
  thousand.</p>

  <p>King Ren, Margaret's father, was very much touched with this generosity
  and kindness on the part of his old family enemy. He himself, at that time,
  was wholly destitute, and unable to do anything for his daughter's relief.
  He, however, wrote a letter of warm thanks to Philip, in which he declared
  that he had not merited, and did not expect such kindness at his hand.</p>

  <p>We have in the conduct of the Duke of Burgundy on this occasion, one
  single and solitary example, among all the Christian knights, and nobles, and
  princes that figure in this long and melancholy story of contention, cruelty,
  and crime in which the Savior's rule, Forgive your enemies, do good to them
  that hate you, was cordially obeyed and what happy fruits immediately
  resulted to all concerned How much of all the vast amount of bloodshed and
  suffering which prevailed during these gloomy times would have been
  prevented, if those who professed to be followers of Christ had been really
  what they pretended.</p>

  <p>With the money which Margaret obtained from the of Burgundy she was
  enabled to continue her journey in some tolerable, degree of comfort to the
  old home of her childhood in Lorraine. All that her father could do for her
  was to furnish her, a humble place of refuge in a castle at Verdun, on the
  River Moselle, which flows through the province. She went there, attended
  with a small number of followers, and here she remained, in utter seclusion
  from the world and almost forgotten, for seven long years.</p>

  <p>During all this time she enjoyed the comfort and satisfaction of having
  her son, the prince, with her, and of watching his progress to manhood under
  her own personal charge and that of one or two accomplished men who still
  adhered to her, and who aided her in the education of her boy. She was,
  however, hopelessly separated from her, husband. For a long time she did not
  know what had become of him. During this time he was leading a very
  precarious and wandering life in England, going from one hiding-place to
  another, wherever his friends could most conveniently secrete him. At length,
  however; the heavy tidings came to the queen, in her retreat at Verdun, that
  her husband had been betrayed in one of his retreats, and had been seized and
  carried to London as a prisoner in a very ignominious manner. It was to have
  been expected that he would be immediately put to death; but, as a matter of
  policy, the York party thought it not best to proceed to that extremity,
  especially as all his kingly right would have immediately descended to his
  son, in whose hands, with such a mother to aid him, they would have become
  more formidable than ever. Thus, on many accounts, it was better for his
  enemies to allow the old king to live.</p>

  <p>But very special precautions were taken by King Edward's government to
  prevent Margaret and the young prince from coming into England again. A coast
  guard was set all along the shore, and every one in England who was suspected
  of being in communication with the exiled queen was watched and guarded in
  the closest manner possible. Some were tortured and put to death in the
  attempt to force them to give up letters or papers supposed to be in their
  possession. A certain wealthy merchant of London was accused of treason, and
  very severely punished, simply because he had been asked to loan money to
  Margaret, and, though he refused to make the loan, did not inform the
  authorities of the application which had been made to him.</p>

  <p>Among other examples of the shocking cruelty of which those in power were
  guilty, in their hatred of Margaret and her cause, it is said that one man,
  who was found out, as they thought, in an attempt to convey letters to and
  fro between Margaret and some of her friends in England, was torn to pieces
  with red-hot pincers in a fruitless attempt to make him confess who the
  persons were in England for whom the letters were intended. But he bore the
  torture to the end, and died without betraying the secret.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE RECONCILIATION WITH WARWICK</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the fall of 1469, Margaret's mind was aroused to new life
  and excitement by news which came from England that great opposition had
  gradually grown up in the realm against the government of Edward, that many
  of his best friends had forsaken him, and that the friends and partisans of
  the Lancaster line were increasing in strength and courage to such a degree
  as to make it probable that the time was drawing nigh when Henry might be
  restored to the throne. The most important circumstance connected with the
  change which had taken place was that the great Earl of Warwick, who had been
  the most efficient and powerful supporter of the house of York, and the most
  determined enemy of Margaret and Henry during the whole war, had now
  abandoned Edward, and had come to France, and was ready to throw all the
  weight of his power and influence on the other side.</p>

  <p>Of course, these tidings produced a great excitement all over France. King
  Louis XI. was specially interested in them, as they afforded a hope that
  Margaret might regain her throne, and so be able to redeem her mortgage, or
  else deliver up to him the security; so he called a council at Tours to
  consider what was best to be done, .and he sent for Margaret at Verdun to
  come with the prince and. attend it. He also sent for Ren, her father, and
  other influential family friends. It is said that when Margaret arrived and
  met her father, she was so much agitated by the news, and by the hopes which
  it awakened in her bosom, that, in embracing him, she burst into tears from
  the excess of her excitement and joy.</p>

  <p>But she could not endure the idea of a reconciliation with Warwick. At
  first she positively refused to see or to speak to him. When, however, at,
  length he arrived at Tours, the king introduced him into Margaret's presence,
  but for a longtime she refused to have any thing to do with him.</p>

  <p>"She could never forgive him,'' she said. "He had been the chief author of
  the downfall of her husband, and of all the sorrows and calamities which had
  since befallen her and her son.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she said, "even if she were willing to forgive him for the
  intolerable wrongs which he had inflicted upon her, it would be very
  prejudicial to her husband's cause to enter into any agreement or alliance
  with him whatever; for all her party and friends in England, whom Warwick had
  done so much to injure, and who had so long looked upon him as their worst
  and deadliest foe, would be wholly alienated from her if they were to know
  that she had taken him into favor, and thus she would lose much more than she
  would gain."</p>

  <p>Warwick replied to this as well as he could, pleading the injuries which
  he had himself received from the Lancaster party as an excuse for his
  hostility against them. Then, moreover, he had been the means of unsettling
  King Edward in his realm, and of preparing the way for King Henry to return;
  and he promised that, if Margaret would receive him into her service, he
  would thenceforth be true and faithful to her as long as he lived, and be as
  much King Edward's foe as he had hitherto been his friend. He appealed,
  moreover, to the King of France to be his surety that he would faithfully
  perform these stipulations.</p>

  <p>The King of France said that he would be his surety, and he begged that
  Margaret would pardon Warwick, and receive him into favor for his sake, and
  for the great love that he, the king, bore to him. He would do more for him,
  he added, than for any man living.</p>

  <p>Margaret at last allowed herself to be persuaded, and Warwick was
  forgiven.</p>

  <p>There were several other great nobles, who had come over with Warwick,
  that were received into Margaret's favor at the same time, and, when the
  grand reconciliation was completely effected, the whole party set out
  together to go down the Loire to Angers, where the Countess of Warwick, the
  earl's wife, and his youngest daughter, Anne, were awaiting them. The
  countess and Anne were presented to the queen, and a short time afterward
  Louis ventured to propose a marriage between Anne and Prince Edward.</p>

  <p>Margaret received this proposal with astonishment, and rejected it with
  scorn. She said she could see neither honor nor profit in it, either for
  herself or for her son. But at length, after a fortnight had been spent in
  reasoning with her on the advantages of the connection, and the aid which she
  would derive from such an alliance with Warwick in endeavoring to recover her
  husband's kingdom, she finally yielded. She was influenced at last, in coming
  to this decision, by the advice of her father, who counseled her to consent
  to the match.</p>

  <p>The parties united in a grand religious ceremony in the cathedral church
  of Angers to seal and ratify the covenants and agreements by which they were
  now to be bound.</p>

  <p>There was a fragment of the true cross, so supposed, among the relics in
  the cathedral; and this was an object of such veneration that an oath taken
  upon it was considered as imposing an obligation of the highest sanctity.
  Each of the three great parties took an oath, in turn, upon this holy
  emblem.</p>

  <p>First, the Earl of Warwick swore that he would, without change, always
  hold to the party of King Henry, and serve him, the queen, and the prince, as
  a true and faithful subject ought to serve his sovereign lord.</p>

  <p>Next; the King of France swore that he would help and. sustain, to the
  utmost of his power, the Earl of Warwick in the quarrel of King Henry.</p>

  <p>And, finally, Queen Margaret swore to treat the earl as true and faithful
  to King Henry and the prince, and "for his deeds past never to make him any
  reproach."</p>

  <p>It was furthermore agreed at this time that Anne, the Earl of Warwick's
  daughter, who was betrothed to the prince, should be delivered to Queen
  Margaret, and should remain under her charge until the marriage should be
  consummated. But this, was not to take place until the Earl of Warwick had
  been into England and had recovered the realm, or the greater portion of it
  at least, and restored it to King Henry. Thus the consummation of the
  marriage was to depend upon Warwick's success in restoring Henry his
  crown.</p>

  <p>Still, a sort of marriage ceremony, or, more strictly, a ceremony of
  betrothal, was celebrated at Angers between the prince and' his affianced
  bride a few days afterward, with great parade, and then Warwick, leaving his
  countess and his daughter behind with Margaret, set out for England with a
  troop of two thousand men which Louis had furnished him.</p>

  <p>After Warwick had gone, Margaret remained at Angers for some weeks, and
  then set out for Paris, escorted by a guard of honor. Her party arrived at
  the capital in November, and Margaret, by Louis's orders, was received with
  all the ceremonies and marks of distinction due to a queen. The streets
  through which she passed were hung with tapestry, and ornamented with flags
  and banners, and with every other suitable decoration. The people came out in
  throngs to see the grand procession pass; for, in addition to the guard of
  honor which had conducted the party to the capital, all the great public
  functionaries and high officials joined in the procession at the gates, and
  accompanied it through the city, thus forming a grand and imposing
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>Queen Margaret and her party were in this way conducted to the palace, and
  lodged there in great splendor. Their hearts were gladdened, too, on their
  arrival, by receiving the news that Warwick had landed in England, and had
  been completely successful in his undertaking. King Edward was deposed, and
  King Henry had been released from his imprisonment in the Tower and placed
  upon the throne.</p>

  <p>Margaret, of course, at once determined that she would immediately make
  preparations for returning to England.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE preparations which were required for Margaret and her
  company to return to England in suitable state seem to have consumed several
  months; for, although it was as early as November that the great entrance
  into Paris took place, and the news of Henry's restoration was received, it
  was not until February that the royal party were ready to embark. There were
  negotiations to be made, and men to be enlisted, and ships to be procured,
  and funds to be provided, and appointments to be decided upon, and dresses to
  be made, and a thousand questions of precedence and etiquette to be
  considered and arranged. At length, however, all was ready, and the whole
  company proceeded together to the port which had been selected as the place
  of embarkation. This port was Harfleur. Harfleur is situated on the coast of
  Normandy, near the more modern port of Havre.</p>

  <p>When the time arrived for sailing, the weather looked very unfavorable;
  but Margaret, who had become weary with the delays by which her return had
  been so long postponed, and was very impatient to arrive in her own dominions
  again, ordered the ships to put to sea. Three times did they make the
  attempt, and three times were the ships driven back into port again. Many of
  her friends were greatly discouraged by these failures. Some said they
  thought that this continued resistance of the elements to her plans ought to
  be regarded as an indication of divine Providence that she was not to go to
  England at present, and they begged her to defer the attempt. Others thought
  that the contrary winds were raised by witches, and they began to devise
  measures for finding out who the witches were.</p>

  <p>Margaret paid no attention to either of these suggestions, but persisted
  in her determination to sail the moment that the weather should allow. This
  delay was a source of great inconvenience to her, and it occasioned a good
  deal of expense; for, besides her own personal officers and attendants,
  Margaret had collected quite a large body of soldiers to cross the Channel
  with her, in order to re-enforce the armies of Warwick and of Henry. This was
  quite necessary; for, although Henry had been nominally restored to the
  throne, his enemies were yet in the field in considerable force, and Margaret
  was very desirous of bringing with her the means of helping to put them down.
  In deed, she knew that the situation of her husband was extremely precarious,
  and that the fortune of war might at any time turn against him. And this
  consideration made her extremely impatient at the delay occasioned by the
  weather at Harfleur. She did not know but that the king might even then be
  engaged in close conflict with his foes, and likely to be overwhelmed by
  them, and that her force, by being so long: delayed, would arrive too late to
  save him.</p>

  <p>Alas for poor Margaret! It was, indeed, exactly so.</p>

  <p>It was not until the 24th of March that it was possible to leave the port;
  but then, although the weather was by no means settled, the queen determined
  to wait no longer. The Countess of Warwick, who had been left in France when
  the earl her husband went to England, sailed from Harfleur at the same time
  with the queen, though in a different vessel. Her daughter, however, the
  prince regent's bride elect, went with the, queen.</p>

  <p>The weather continued very boisterous after the fleet sailed, and as the
  gales which blew so heavily were from the north, the ships could make very
  little progress. They were kept beating about in the Channel, or lying at
  anchor waiting for a change of wind, for more than a fortnight. During all
  this time Margaret was kept in a perfect fever of impatience and anxiety.</p>

  <p>At length, about the 10th of April, they reached the land at Weymouth.</p>

  <p>After the ships entered the port, the space of a day or two was occupied
  in making preparations to land. Among these preparations was included the
  work of arranging apartments at an abbey in the vicinity of Weymouth to
  receive the queen and her attendants. In the mean time, the landing of the
  troops was pushed forward as rapidly as possible.</p>

  <p>The ship in which the Countess of Warwick embarked had sailed in a
  different direction from Margaret's fleet, and it was not known yet what had
  become of her.</p>

  <p>When at last the preparations were completed, the queen and her party went
  on shore and took up their abode in the abbey. Margaret's mind was intensely
  occupied with the arrangements necessary for marshaling her troops and
  getting them ready to march to the assistance of Warwick, when, to her
  amazement and consternation, she received news, on the very next day after
  she took up her abode in the abbey, that the party of King Edward had
  mustered in great force and advanced toward London, and that a battle had
  been fought at a place called Barnet, a few miles from London, in which
  Edward's party had been completely victorious.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Warwick had been killed. King Henry her husband had been taken
  prisoner, and their cause seemed to be wholly lost.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Death of Warwick</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Warwick had gone into the battle on foot, in order the more effectually to
  stimulate the emulation of his men, so that when, in the end, his forces were
  defeated, and fled, he himself, being encumbered by his armor, could not save
  himself, but was overtaken by his remorseless enemies and slain.</p>

  <p>The terrible agitation and anguish that this news excited in the mind of
  the queen it would be impossible to describe. She fell at first into a swoon,
  and when at length her senses returned, she was so completely overwhelmed
  with disappointment, vexation, and rage, and talked so wildly and
  incoherently, that her friends almost feared that she would lose her reason.
  Her son, the young prince, who was now nearly nineteen years of age, did all
  in his power to soothe and calm her, and at length so far succeeded as to
  induce her to consider what was to be done to secure her own and his safety.
  To remain where they were was to expose themselves to be attacked at any time
  by a body of Edward's victorious troops and conveyed prisoner to the
  Tower.</p>

  <p>There was another abbey at not a great distance from where Margaret now
  was, which was endowed with certain privileges as a sanctuary, such that
  persons seeking refuge there under certain circumstances could not be taken
  away. The name of this retreat was Beaulieu Abbey. Margaret immediately
  proceeded across the country to this place, taking with her the prince and
  nearly all the others of her party. Either on her arrival here, or on the
  way, she met the Countess of Warwick, who, it will be recollected, had left
  Harfleur at the same time that she did. The countess's ship had been driven
  farther to the eastward, and she had finally landed at Portsmouth. Here she
  too had learned the news of the battle of Barnet and of the death of her
  husband, and, being completely overwhelmed with the tidings, and also alarmed
  for her own safety, she had determined to fly for refuge to Beaulieu Abbey
  too.</p>

  <p>The two unhappy ladies, who had parted, three weeks before, on the coast
  of France with such high and excellent expectations, now met, both plunged in
  the deepest and most overwhelming sorrow. Their hopes were blasted, all their
  bright prospects were destroyed, and they found themselves in the condition
  of helpless and wretched fugitives, dependent upon a religious sanctuary for
  the hope of even saving their lives.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; CHILDLESS, AND A WIDOW</h2>

  <p class="first">MARGARET did not trust entirely for her safety to the
  sacredness of the sanctuary where she had sought refuge. She endeavored, by
  all the means in her power, to keep the place of her retreat secret from all
  but her chosen and most trustworthy friends. Very soon, however, she was
  visited by some of these, especially by some young nobles, who came to her
  exasperated, and all on fire with rage and resentment, on account of the
  death of their friends and relatives, who had been slain in the battle.</p>

  <p>They found Margaret, however, in a state of mind very different from their
  own. She was beginning to be discouraged. The long continued and bitter
  experience of failure and disappointment, which had now, for so many years,
  been her constant lot, seemed at last to have had power to undermine and
  destroy even her resolution and energy. Her friends, when they came to see
  her, found her plunged in a sort of stupor of wretchedness and despair from
  which they found it difficult to rouse her.</p>

  <p>And when, at length, they succeeded in so far awakening her from her
  despondency as to induce her to take some interest in their consultations,
  her only feeling for the time being seemed to be anxiety for the safety of
  her son. She begged and implored them to take some measures to protect him.
  They endeavored to convince her that her situation was not so desperate as
  she imagined. They had still a powerful force, they said, on their side. That
  force was now rallying and reassembling, and, with her presence and that of
  the young prince at their head-quarters, the numbers and enthusiasm of their
  troops would be very rapidly increased, and there was great hope that they
  might soon be able again to meet the enemy under more favorable auspices than
  ever.</p>

  <p>But the queen seemed very unwilling to accede to their views. It was of no
  use, she said, to make any farther effort. They were not strong enough to
  meet their enemies in battle, and nothing but fresh disasters would result
  from making the attempt. There was nothing to be done but for herself and the
  young prince, with as many others as were disposed to share her fortunes, to
  return as soon as possible to France, and there to remain and wait for better
  times.</p>

  <p>But the young prince was not willing to adopt this plan. He was young, and
  full of confidence and hope, and he joined the nobles in urging his mother to
  consent to take the field. His influence prevailed; and Margaret, though with
  great reluctance and many forebodings, finally yielded.</p>

  <p>So she left the sanctuary, and, with the prince, was escorted secretly to
  the northward, in order to join the army there. The western counties of
  England, those lying on the borders of Wales, had long been very favorable to
  Henry's cause, and when the people learned that the queen and the young
  prince were there, they came out in great numbers, as the nobles had
  predicted, to join her standard. In a short time a large army was ready to
  take the field.</p>

  <p>Margaret was at this time at Bath. She soon heard that King Edward was
  coming against her from London with a large army. Her own forces, she
  thought, were not yet strong enough to meet him; so she formed the plan of
  crossing the Severn into Wales, and waiting there until she should have a
  larger force concentrated.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, from Bath she went down to Bristol, which, as will be seen
  from the map, is on the banks of the Severn, at a place where the river is
  very wide. She could not cross here, the lowest bridge on the river being at
  Gloucester, thirty or forty miles farther up; so she moved up to Gloucester,
  intending to cross there. But she found the bridge fortified, and in the
  possession of an officer under the orders of the Duke of Gloucester, who was
  a partisan of King Edward, and he refused to allow the queen to pass without
  an order from his master.</p>

  <p>It seemed not expedient to attempt to force the bridge, and, accordingly,
  Margaret and her party went on up the river in order to find some other place
  to cross into Wales. She was very much excited on this journey, and suffered
  great anxiety, for the army of King Edward was advancing rapidly, and there
  was danger that she would be intercepted and her retreat cut off; so she
  pressed forward with the utmost diligence, and at length, after having
  marched thirty- seven miles in one day with her troops, she arrived at
  Tewkesbury, a town situated about midway between Gloucester and Worcester.
  When she arrived there, she found that Edward had arrived already within a
  mile of the place, at the head of a great army, and was ready for battle.</p>

  <p>There was, however, now an opportunity for Margaret to cross the river and
  retire for a time into Wales, and she was herself extremely desirous of doing
  so, but the young nobles who were with her, and especially the Duke of
  Somerset, a violent and hot-headed young man, who acted as the leader of
  them, would not consent. He declared that he would retreat no farther.</p>

  <p>"We will make a stand here;" said he, "and take such fortune as God may
  send us."</p>

  <p>So he pitched his camp in the park which lay upon the confines of the
  town, and threw up intrenchments. Many of the other leaders were strongly
  opposed to his plan of making a stand in this place, but Somerset was the
  chief in command, and he would have his way.</p>

  <p>He, however, showed no disposition to shelter himself personally from any
  portion of the danger to which his friends and followers were to be exposed.
  He took command of the advanced guard. The young prince, supported by some
  other leaders of age and experience, was also to be placed in a responsible
  and important position. When all was ready, Margaret and the prince rode
  along the ranks, speaking words of encouragement to the troops, and promising
  large rewards to them in case they gained the victory.</p>

    <p class="caption">View of Tewkesbury</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Margaret's heart was full of anxiety and agitation as the hour for the
  commencement of hostilities drew nigh. She had often before staked very dear
  and highly-valued friends in the field of battle, but now, for the first
  time, she was putting to hazard the life of her dearly beloved and only son.
  It was very much against her will that she was brought to incur this terrible
  danger. It was only the sternest necessity that compelled her to do it.</p>

  <p>When the battle began, Margaret withdrew to an elevation within the park,
  from which she could witness the progress of the fight. For some time her
  army remained on the defensive within their intrenchments, but at length
  Somerset, becoming impatient and impetuous, determined on making a sally and
  attacking the assailants in the open field.</p>

  <p>So, ordering the others to follow him, he issued forth from the lines.
  Some obeyed him, and others did not. After a while he returned within the
  lines again, apparently for the purpose of calling those who remained there
  to account for not obeying him. He found Lord Wenlock, one of the leaders,
  sitting upon his horse idle, as he said, in the town. He immediately
  denounced him as a traitor, and, riding up to him, cut him down with a blow
  from his battle-axe, which cleft his skull.</p>

  <p>The men who were under Lord Wenlock's banner, seeing their leader thus
  mercilessly slain, immediately began to fly. Their flight caused a panic,
  which rapidly spread among all the other troops, and the whole field was soon
  in utter confusion.</p>

  <p>When Margaret saw this, and thought of the prince, exposed, as he was, to
  the most imminent danger in the defeat, she became almost frantic with
  excitement and terror. She insisted on rushing into the field to find and
  save her son. Those around found it almost impossible to restrain her. At
  length, in the struggle, her excitement and terror entirely overpowered her.
  She swooned away, and her attendants then bore her senseless to a carriage,
  and she was driven rapidly away out through one of the park gates, and thence
  by a by-road to a religious house near by, where it was thought she would be
  for the moment secure.</p>

  <p>The poor prince was taken prisoner. He was conveyed, after the battle, to
  Edward's tent. The historians of the day relate the following story of the
  sad termination of his career.</p>

  <p><a id="pic22"
     name="pic22"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The Murder of Prince Henry</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>When Edward, accompanied by his officers and the nobles in attendance upon
  him, covered with the blood and the dust of the conflict, and fierce and
  exultant under the excitement of slaughter and victory, came into the tent,
  and saw the handsome young prince standing there in the hands of his captors,
  he was at first struck with the elegance of his appearance and his frank and
  manly bearing. He, however, accosted him fiercely by demanding what brought
  him to England. The prince replied fearlessly that he came to recover his
  father's crown and his own inheritance. Upon this, Edward threw his glove, a
  heavy iron gauntlet, in his face.</p>

  <p>The men standing by took this as an indication of Edward's feelings and
  wishes in respect to his prisoner, and they fell upon him at once with their
  swords and murdered him upon the spot.</p>

  <p>Margaret did not know what had become of her son until the following day.
  By that time King Edward had discovered the place of her retreat, and he sent
  a certain Sir William Stanley, who had always been one of her most inveterate
  enemies, to take her prisoner and bring her to him. It was this Stanley who,
  when he came, brought her the news of her son's death. He communicated the
  news to her, it was said, in an exultant manner, as if he was not only glad
  of the prince's death, but as if he rejoiced in having the opportunity of
  witnessing the despair and grief with which the mother was overwhelmed in
  hearing the tidings.</p>

  <p>Stanley conveyed the queen to Coventry, where King Edward then was, and
  placed her at his disposal. Edward was then going to London in a sort of
  triumphant march in honor of his victory, and he ordered that Stanley should
  take Margaret with him in his train. Anne of Warwick, her son's young bride,
  was taken to London too, at the same time and in the same way.</p>

  <p>During the whole of the journey Margaret was in a continued state of the
  highest excitement, being almost wild with grief and rage. She uttered
  continual maledictions against Edward for having murdered her boy, and
  nothing could soothe or quiet her.</p>

  <p>It might be supposed that there would have been one source of comfort open
  to her during this dreadful journey in the thought that, in going to the
  Tower, which was now undoubtedly to be her destination, she should rejoin her
  husband, who had been for some time imprisoned there. But the hope of being
  thus once more united to almost the last object of affection that now
  remained to her upon earth, if Margaret really cherished it, was doomed to a
  bitter disappointment. The death of the young prince made it now an object of
  great importance to the reigning line that Henry himself should be put out of
  the way, and, on the very night of Margaret's arrival at the Tower, her
  husband was assassinated in the room which had so long been his prison.</p>

  <p>Thus all Queen Margaret's bright hopes of happiness were, in two short
  months, completely and forever destroyed. At the close of the month of March
  she was the proud and happy queen of a monarch ruling over one of the most
  wealthy and powerful kingdoms on the globe, and the mother of a prince who
  was endowed with every personal grace and noble accomplishment, affianced to
  a high-born, beautiful, and immensely wealthy bride, and just entering what
  promised to be a long and glorious career. In May, just two months later, she
  was childless and a widow. Both her husband and her son were lying in bloody
  graves, and she herself, fallen from her throne, was shut up, a helpless
  captive, in a gloomy dungeon, with no prospect of deliverance before her to
  the end of her days. The annals even of royalty, filled as they are with
  examples of overwhelming calamity, can perhaps furnish no other instance of
  so total and terrible reverse of fortune as this.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the day following the assassination of Henry, the body
  was taken from the Tower and conveyed through the streets of London, with a
  strong escort of armed men to guard it, to the Church of St. Paul's, there to
  be publicly exhibited, as was customary on such occasions. Such an exhibition
  was more necessary than usual in this case, as the fact of Henry's death
  might, perhaps, have afterward been called in question, and designing men
  might have continued to agitate the country in his name, if there had not
  been the most positive proof furnished to the public that he was no more.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">View of Chertsey</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The body remained lying thus during the day. When night came, it was taken
  away and carried down to Blackfriar's&mdash;a landing upon the river nearly
  opposite Saint Paul's. Here there was a boat lying ready to receive the
  hearse. It was lighted with torches, and the watermen were at their oars. The
  hearse was put on board, and the body was thus borne away, over the dark
  waters of the river, to the lonely village of Chertsey, where it had been
  decided that he should be interred.</p>

  <p>For some time after Henry's death Margaret was kept in close confinement
  in the Tower. At length, finding that every thing was quiet, and that the new
  government was becoming firmly established, the rigor of the unhappy
  captive's imprisonment was relaxed. She was removed first to Windsor, and
  afterward to Wallingford, a place in the interior of the country, where she
  enjoyed a considerable degree of personal freedom, though she was still very
  closely watched and guarded.</p>

  <p>At length, about four years afterward, her father, King Ren, succeeded in
  obtaining her ransom for the sum of fifty thousand crowns. Ren was not the
  possessor of so much money himself, but he induced King Louis to pay it, on
  condition of his conveying to him his family domain.</p>

  <p>The ransom was to be paid in five annual installments, but on the payment
  of the first installment the queen was to be released and allowed to return
  to her native land. It was stipulated, too, that, as a condition of her
  release, she was formally and forever to renounce all the rights of every
  kind within the realm of England to which she might have laid claim through
  her marriage with Henry. It might have been supposed that they would have
  required her to sign this renunciation before releasing her. But it was held
  by the law of England, then as now, that a signature made under durance was
  invalid, the signer not being free. So it was arranged that an English
  commissioner was to accompany her across the Channel, and go with her to
  Rouen, where he was to deliver her to the French embassadors, who, in the
  name of Louis, were to be responsible for her signing the document.</p>

  <p>This plan was carried into effect. Margaret set out from the castle of
  Wallingford under the care of a man on whom Edward's government could rely
  for keeping a close watch over her, and taking care that she went on quietly
  through England to the port of embarkation. This port was Sandwich. Here she
  embarked on board a vessel, with a retinue of three ladies and seven
  gentlemen, and bade a final farewell to the kingdom which she had entered on
  her bridal tour with such high and exultant expectations of grandeur and
  happiness.</p>

  <p>She arrived at Dieppe in the beginning of 1476, and proceeded immediately
  to Rouen, where the commissioner, who came to attend her, delivered her to
  the French embassadors appointed to receive her, and attend to the signing of
  the renunciation.</p>

  <p>The document was written in Latin, but the import of it was as follows
  :</p>

  <p>I, Margaret, formerly in England married, renounce all that I could
  pretend to in England, by the conditions of my marriage, with all other
  things there, to Edward, now King of England.</p>

  <p>It cost Margaret no effort to sign this paper. With the death of her
  husband and her son all hope had been extinguished in her bosom, and life now
  possessed nothing that she desired. She signed this fatal document,
  renouncing not only all claims to be henceforth considered a queen, but all
  pretension that she had ever been one, with a passive indifference and
  unconcern which showed that her spirit was broken, and that the fires of
  pride and ambition which had burned so fiercely in her breast were now, at
  last, extinguished forever.</p>

  <p>When the paper was signed Margaret was dismissed and left at liberty to go
  her own way to her native province of Anjou, where it was her intention to
  spend the remainder of her days. Her plan was to pass by the way of Paris, in
  order to see once more her cousin, King Louis, who had treated her with so
  much consideration and honor when she was on her way to England with a fair
  prospect of finding her husband upon the throne. But the case was different
  now, Louis thought, and instead of receiving kindly her intimation that she
  was intending to visit Paris on her way home, he sent her word that she had
  better not come, and advised her instead to make the best of her way to her
  father in Anjou.</p>

  <p>He, however, as if to soften this incivility, sent an escort to accompany
  her in her journey home, but Margaret was so stung by her cousin's heartless
  abandonment of her in her distress that she resolved to accept no favor at
  his hands; so she refused the escort, and set out with her few personal
  companions alone.</p>

  <p>This little blazing up of the old flames of pride and resentment in her
  heart came near, however, to costing Margaret her life, for she had not gone
  far on her journey before an emergency occurred in which an escort would have
  been of great service to her. It seems that when the English were driven out
  of Normandy, many families and some whole villages remained of people who
  were too. poor to return. These people were now in a very low and miserable
  condition. They mourned continually the hard necessity by which they had been
  left without friends or protection in a foreign land; and they understood,
  too, that the first beginning of the abandonment of their possessions in
  France by the English was the cession of certain provinces by the government
  of Henry VI. at the time of that monarch's marriage with Margaret of Anjou,
  and that all the subsequent misfortunes of their countrymen in France, by
  which, in the end, the whole country had been lost, had their origin in these
  transactions.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that Margaret, on her journey from Rouen to Anjou, stopped
  the first night at one of these villages. The people, seeing a party of
  strangers come to town, gathered round the inn at night from curiosity to
  learn who they might be. When they were informed that it was Margaret of
  Anjou, Queen of England, who had been banished from the kingdom, and was now
  returning home, they were excited to the highest pitch of anger against her
  as the author of all their sufferings. They made a rush into the house to
  seize her, and, if they had been successful, they would doubtless have killed
  her upon the spot. But some of the gentlemen who were in her party defended
  her sword in hand, and kept the mob at bay until she gained her apartment.
  They guarded her there until they could send for the authorities, who came
  and dispersed the mob. Margaret immediately returned to Rouen, willing enough
  now to accept of an escort. A proper guard was provided for her, and under
  the protection of it she set out once more on her journey, and this time went
  on in safety.</p>

  <p>When Margaret at last reached her native country of Anjou, she was
  received very kindly by her father, and went to live with him in a castle
  called the castle of Recule, situated about a league from Angers, the
  capital of the province.</p>

  <p>Here she remained about four years. It was a very pleasant place. The
  castle was situated upon the bank of a river, and yet in a commanding
  situation, which afforded a pretty view of the town. There was a beautiful
  garden attached to the castle, and a gallery of painting and sculpture. Her
  father, King Ren, was a painter himself, and he amused himself a great deal
  in painting pictures to add to his collection or to give to his friends.</p>

  <p>But Margaret could take no interest in any of these things. Her mind was
  all the time filled with bitter recollections of the past, which, even if she
  did not cling to and cherish them, she could not dispel. She dwelt
  continually upon thoughts of her husband and her child. She made ceaseless
  efforts to obtain possession of their bodies, in order that she might have
  them transported to Anjou, and, as she could not succeed in this, she paid
  annually a considerable sum to secure the services of priests to say masses
  over their graves in England, in order to secure the repose of their
  souls.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the anguish and agitation which continually reigned in her heart
  preyed upon her like a worm in the centre of a flower. "Her eyes, once so
  brilliant and expressive," says one of her historians, "became hollow and
  dim, and permanently inflamed from continual weeping."Indeed, the whole mass
  of her blood became corrupted, and a fearful disease affected her once
  beautiful skin, making her an object of commiseration to all who beheld
  her.</p>

  <p>She continued in this state until her father died. He, on his death-bed,
  committed her to the care of an old and faithful friend, who, after King
  Ren's decease, took her with him to his own castle of Damprierre, which was
  situated about twenty-five miles farther up the river.</p>

  <p>But, though Margaret was treated very kindly by the friend to whom her
  father thus consigned her, she did not long survive this change. She died,
  and was buried in the cathedral at Angers, and for centuries afterward the
  ecclesiastics of the chapter, once every year, at the return of the proper
  anniversary, performed a solemn ceremony over her grave by walking round it
  with a slow and measured step, singing a hymn.</p>
